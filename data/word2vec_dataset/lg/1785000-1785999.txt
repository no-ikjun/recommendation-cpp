 In the 1959 – 60 NBA season , Chamberlain joined a Warriors squad that was coached by Neil Johnston and contained Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame guards Tom Gola and Paul Arizin , plus Ernie Beck and his old rival , Guy Rodgers ; remarkably , all five starters were Philadelphians . In his first NBA game , against the New York Knicks , the rookie center scored 43 points and grabbed 28 rebounds . In his fourth game , Philadelphia met the reigning champions , the Boston Celtics of Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame coach Red Auerbach , whose offer Chamberlain had snubbed several years before , and Bill Russell , who was now lauded as one of the best defensive pivots in the game . In what was the first of many Chamberlain @-@ Russell match @-@ ups , Chamberlain outscored Russell with 30 points versus 28 points , but Boston won the game . Chamberlain and his perennial nemesis would grow to become one of the NBA 's greatest on @-@ court rivalries of all time . Nevertheless , the two also became friends off the court , similar to later rivals Magic Johnson and Larry Bird . 
 In his first NBA season , Chamberlain averaged 37 @.@ 6 points and 27 rebounds , convincingly breaking the previous regular @-@ season records . He needed only 56 games to score 2 @,@ 102 points , which broke the all @-@ time regular season scoring record of Bob Pettit , who needed 72 games to score 2 @,@ 101 points . Chamberlain broke eight NBA records , and was named NBA MVP and Rookie of the Year that season , a feat matched only by fellow Hall @-@ of @-@ Famer Wes Unseld in the 1968 – 69 NBA season . Chamberlain capped off his rookie season by winning the 1960 NBA All @-@ Star Game MVP award with a 23 @-@ point , 25 @-@ rebound performance for the East . However , it also became evident that he was an atrocious free @-@ throw shooter , making hardly half of his foul shots . As time progressed , Chamberlain grew even worse , and acknowledged he was simply a " psycho case " on that matter . 
 The Warriors entered the 1960 NBA Playoffs and beat the Syracuse Nationals , setting up a meeting versus the Eastern Division champions , the Boston Celtics . Cherry described how Celtics coach Red Auerbach ordered his forward Tom Heinsohn to commit personal fouls on Chamberlain : whenever the Warriors shot foul shots , Heinsohn grabbed and shoved Chamberlain to prevent him from running back quickly ; his intention was that the Celtics would throw the ball in so fast that the prolific <unk> Chamberlain was not yet back under his own basket , and Boston could score an easy fastbreak basket . The teams split the first two games , but in Game 3 , Chamberlain got fed up with Heinsohn and punched him . In the scuffle , Wilt injured his hand , and Philadelphia lost the next two games . In Game 5 , with his hand healthy , Chamberlain scored 50 points . But in Game 6 , Heinsohn got the last laugh , scoring the decisive basket with a last @-@ second tip @-@ in . The Warriors lost the series 4 – 2 . 
 The rookie Chamberlain then shocked Warriors ' fans by saying he was thinking of retiring . He was tired of being double- and triple @-@ teamed , and of teams coming down on him with hard fouls . Chamberlain feared he might lose his cool one day . Celtics forward Heinsohn said : " Half the fouls against him were hard fouls ... he took the most brutal pounding of any player ever " . In addition , Chamberlain was seen as a freak of nature , jeered at by the fans and scorned by the media . As Chamberlain often said , quoting coach Alex Hannum 's explanation of his situation , " Nobody loves Goliath . " Eddie Gottlieb coaxed Chamberlain back into the NBA , sweetening his return with a salary raise to $ 65 @,@ 000 ( equal to about $ 520 @,@ 000 today ) . 
 The following season , Chamberlain surpassed his rookie season statistics as he averaged 38 @.@ 4 points and 27 @.@ 2 rebounds per game . He became the first player to break the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ point barrier and the first and still only player to break the 2 @,@ 000 @-@ rebound barrier for a single season , grabbing 2 @,@ 149 boards . Chamberlain also won his first field goal percentage title , and set the all @-@ time record for rebounds in a single game with 55 . Chamberlain was so dominant on the team that he scored almost 32 % of his team 's points and collected 30 @.@ 4 % of their rebounds . 
 Chamberlain again failed to convert his play into team success , this time bowing out against the Syracuse Nationals in a three @-@ game sweep . Cherry noted that Chamberlain was " difficult " and did not respect coach Neil Johnston , who was unable to handle the star center . In retrospect , Eddie Gottlieb remarked : " My mistake was not getting a strong @-@ handed coach .... [ Johnston ] wasn 't ready for big time . " 
 In Chamberlain 's third season , the Warriors were coached by Frank McGuire , the coach who had masterminded Chamberlain 's painful NCAA loss against the Tar Heels . In that year , Wilt set several all @-@ time records which have never been threatened . In the 1962 season , he averaged 50 @.@ 4 points and grabbed 25 @.@ 7 rebounds per game . On March 2 , 1962 , in Hershey , Pennsylvania , Wilt scored 100 points , shot 36 of 63 from the field , and made 28 of 32 free throws against the New York Knicks . Chamberlain 's 4 @,@ 029 regular @-@ season points made him the only player to break the 4 @,@ 000 @-@ point barrier ; the only other player to break the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ point barrier is Michael Jordan , with 3 @,@ 041 points in the 1986 – 87 NBA season . Chamberlain once again broke the 2 @,@ 000 @-@ rebound barrier with 2 @,@ 052 . Additionally , he was on the hardwood for an average of 48 @.@ 53 minutes , playing 3 @,@ 882 of his team 's 3 @,@ 890 minutes . Because Chamberlain played in overtime games , he averaged more minutes per game than the regulation 48 ; in fact , Chamberlain would have reached the 3 @,@ 890 @-@ minute mark if he had not been ejected in one game after picking up a second technical foul with eight minutes left to play . 
 His extraordinary feats in the 1962 season were later subject of the book Wilt , 1962 by Gary M. Pomerantz ( 2005 ) , who used Chamberlain as a metaphor for the uprising of Black America . In addition to Chamberlain 's regular @-@ season accomplishments , he scored 42 points in the 1962 NBA All @-@ Star Game , still the all @-@ time record . 
 In the 1962 NBA Playoffs , the Warriors met the Boston Celtics again in the Eastern Division Finals , a team which Bob Cousy and Bill Russell called the greatest Celtics team of all time . Each team won their home games , so the series was split at three after six games . In a closely contested Game 7 , Chamberlain tied the game at 107 with 16 seconds to go , but Celtics shooting guard Sam Jones hit a clutch shot with two seconds left to win the series for Boston . In later years , Chamberlain was criticized for averaging 50 points , but not winning a title . In his defense , Warriors coach Frank McGuire said " Wilt has been simply super @-@ human " , and pointed out that the Warriors lacked a consistent second scorer , a playmaker , and a second big man to take pressure off Chamberlain . 
 In the 1962 – 63 NBA season , Eddie Gottlieb sold the Warriors franchise for $ 850 @,@ 000 ( equal to about $ 6 @.@ 65 million today ) to a group of businessmen led by Marty Simmons from San Francisco , and the team relocated to become the San Francisco Warriors under a new coach , Bob Feerick . This also meant , however , that the team broke apart , as Paul Arizin chose to retire rather than move away from his family and his job at IBM in Philadelphia , and Tom Gola was homesick , requesting a trade to the lowly New York Knicks halfway through the season . With both secondary scorers gone , Chamberlain continued his array of statistical feats , averaging 44 @.@ 8 points and 24 @.@ 3 rebounds per game that year . Despite his individual success , the Warriors lost 49 of their 80 games and missed the playoffs . 
 In the 1963 – 64 NBA season , Chamberlain got yet another new coach , Alex Hannum , and was joined by a promising rookie center , Nate Thurmond , who eventually entered the Hall of Fame . Ex @-@ soldier Hannum , who later entered the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach , was a crafty psychologist who emphasized defense and passing . Most importantly , he was not afraid to stand up to the dominant Chamberlain , who was known to " freeze out " ( not communicate with ) coaches he didn 't like . Backed up by valuable rookie Thurmond , Chamberlain had another good season with 36 @.@ 9 ppg and 22 @.@ 3 rpg , and the Warriors went all the way to the NBA Finals . In that series they succumbed to Russell 's Boston Celtics yet again , this time losing 4 – 1 . But as Cherry remarked , not only Chamberlain , but in particular Hannum deserved much credit because he had basically had taken the bad 31 – 49 squad of last year plus Thurmond and made it into a NBA Finalist . In the summer of 1964 Chamberlain , one of the prominent participants at the famed Rucker Park basketball court in New York City , made the acquaintance of a tall , talented 17 @-@ year @-@ old teenager who played there . Soon , the young Lew Alcindor was allowed into his inner circle , and quickly idolized the ten @-@ year older NBA player . Unfortunately , Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar , as Alcindor would name himself later , would develop an intensely personal antipathy . 
 In the following 1964 – 65 NBA season , the Warriors got off to a terrible start and ran into financial trouble . At the 1965 All @-@ Star break Chamberlain was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers , the new name of the relocated Syracuse Nationals . In return the Warriors received Paul Neumann , Connie <unk> , Lee Shaffer ( who opted to retire rather than report to the Warriors ) , and $ 150 @,@ 000 ( equal to about $ 1 @.@ 13 million today ) . When Chamberlain left the Warriors , owner Franklin <unk> said : " Chamberlain is not an easy man to love [ and ] the fans in San Francisco never learned to love him . Wilt is easy to hate [ ... ] people came to see him lose . " 
 = = = Philadelphia 76ers ( 1965 – 1968 ) = = = 
 After the trade Chamberlain found himself on a promising Sixers team that included guards Hal Greer , a future Hall @-@ of @-@ Famer , and talented role players Larry Costello , Chet Walker and Lucious Jackson . Cherry remarks that there was a certain tension within the team : Greer was the formerly undisputed leader and was not willing to give up his authority , and Jackson , a talented center , was now forced to play power forward because Chamberlain blocked the center spot ; however , as the season progressed , the three began to mesh better . Chamberlain did not care for the Sixers ' coach , Dolph Schayes , because Schayes , according to him , had made several disrespectful remarks when they were rival players in the NBA . 
 Statistically , Chamberlain was again outstanding , posting 34 @.@ 7 ppg and 22 @.@ 9 rpg for the second half of the season . After defeating the Cincinnati Royals led by Oscar Robertson in the 1965 NBA Playoffs , the Sixers met Chamberlain 's familiar rival , the Boston Celtics . The press called it an even matchup in all positions , even at center , where Bill Russell was expected to give Chamberlain a tough battle . Indeed , the two teams split the first six games , and because of the better season record , the last game was held in the Celtics ' Boston Garden . In that Game 7 , both centers were marvelous : Chamberlain scored 30 points and 32 rebounds , and Russell logged 16 points , 27 rebounds and eight assists . In the final minute , Chamberlain hit two clutch free throws and slam dunked on Russell , bringing Boston 's lead down to 110 – 109 with five seconds left . Russell botched the inbounds pass , hitting a guy @-@ wire over the backboard and giving the ball back to the Sixers . Coach Schayes called timeout , and decided to run the last play over Hal Greer rather than Chamberlain , because he feared the Celtics would intentionally foul him because he was a poor foul shooter . But when Greer attempted to inbound the ball , John Havlicek stole it to preserve the Celtics ' lead . For the fifth time in seven years , Russell 's team deprived Chamberlain of the title . According to Chamberlain , that was the time that people started calling him " loser " . Additionally , in an April 1965 issue of Sports Illustrated Chamberlain conducted an interview entitled " My Life in a Bush League " where he criticized his fellow players , coaches , and NBA administrators . Chamberlain later commented that he could see in hindsight how the interview was instrumental in damaging his public image . 
 In the 1965 – 66 NBA season the Sixers experienced tragedy when Ike Richman , the Sixers ' co @-@ owner as well as Chamberlain 's confidant and lawyer , died of a coronary . The Sixers would post a 55 – 25 regular season record , and for his strong play , Chamberlain won his second MVP award . In that season , the center again dominated his opposition by recording 33 @.@ 5 points and 24 @.@ 6 rebounds a game , leading the league in both categories . In one particular game , Chamberlain blocked a dunk attempt by Gus Johnson so hard that he dislocated Johnson 's shoulder . Off the court , however , Chamberlain 's commitment to the cause was doubted , as Chamberlain was a late sleeper , lived in New York and preferred to commute to Philadelphia rather than live there , and he was only available during the afternoon for training . Because Schayes did not want to risk angering his best player , he scheduled the daily workout at 4 pm ; this angered the team , who preferred an early schedule to have the afternoon off , but Schayes just said : " There is no other way . " Irv Kosloff , who now owned the Sixers alone after Richman 's death , pleaded to him to move to Philadelphia during the season , but he was turned down . 
 In the 1966 NBA Playoffs , the Sixers again met the Celtics , and for the first time had home @-@ court advantage . However , Boston easily won the first two games on the road , winning 115 – 96 and 114 – 93 ; Chamberlain played within his usual range , but his supporting cast shot under 40 % . This caused sports journalist Joe McGinnis to comment : " The Celtics played like champions and the Sixers just played . " In Game 3 , Chamberlain scored 31 points and 27 rebounds for an important road win , and the next day , coach Schayes planned to hold a joint team practice . However , Chamberlain said he was " too tired " to attend , and even refused Schayes ' plea to at least show up and shoot a few foul shots with the team . In Game 4 , Boston won 114 – 108 . Prior to Game 5 , Chamberlain was nowhere to be found , skipping practice and being non @-@ accessible . Outwardly , Schayes defended his star center as " excused from practice " , but his teammates knew the truth and were much less forgiving . In Game 5 itself , Chamberlain was superb , scoring 46 points and grabbing 34 rebounds , but the Celtics won the game 120 – 112 and the series . Cherry is highly critical of Chamberlain : while conceding he was the only Sixers player who performed in the series , he pointed out his unprofessional , egotistical behavior as being a bad example for his teammates . 
 Prior to the 1966 – 67 NBA season , the friendly but unassertive Schayes was replaced by a familiar face , the crafty but firm Alex Hannum . In what Cherry calls a tumultuous locker room meeting , Hannum addressed several key issues he observed during the last season , several of them putting Chamberlain in an unfavorable light . Sixers forward Chet Walker testified that on several occasions , players had to pull Chamberlain and Hannum apart to prevent a fistfight . Fellow forward Billy Cunningham observed that Hannum " never backed down " and " showed who was the boss " . By doing this , he won Chamberlain 's respect . When emotions cooled off , Hannum pointed out to Chamberlain that he was on the same page in trying to win a title ; but to pull this off , he – like his teammates – had to " act like a man " both on and off the court . Concerning basketball , he persuaded him to change his style of play . Loaded with several other players who could score , such as future Hall @-@ of @-@ Famers Hal Greer and newcomer Billy Cunningham , Hannum wanted Chamberlain to concentrate more on defense . 
 As a result , Chamberlain was less dominant , taking only 14 % of the team 's shots ( in his 50 @.@ 4 ppg season , it was 35 @.@ 3 % ) , but extremely efficient : he averaged a career @-@ low 24 @.@ 1 points , but he led the league in rebounds ( 24 @.@ 2 ) , ended third in assists ( 7 @.@ 8 ) , had a record breaking .683 field goal accuracy , and played strong defense . For these feats , Chamberlain earned his third MVP award . The Sixers charged their way to a then @-@ record 68 – 13 season , including a record 46 – 4 start . In addition , the formerly egotistical Chamberlain began to praise his teammates , lauding hardworking Luke Jackson as the " ultimate power forward " , calling Hal Greer a deadly <unk> , and point guard Wali Jones an excellent defender and outsider scorer . Off the court , the center invited the team to restaurants and paid the entire bill , knowing he earned 10 times more than all the others . Greer , who was considered a consummate professional and often clashed with the center because of his attitude , spoke positively of the new Chamberlain : " You knew in a minute the Big Fella [ Chamberlain ] was ready to go ... and everybody would follow . " 
 In the 1967 NBA Playoffs , the Sixers yet again battled the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Division Finals , and again held home court advantage . In Game 1 , the Sixers beat Boston 127 – 112 , powered by Hal Greer 's 39 points and Chamberlain 's unofficial quadruple double , with 24 points , 32 rebounds , 13 assists and ( unofficially counted ) 12 blocks . In Game 2 , the Sixers won 107 – 102 in overtime , and player @-@ coach Russell grudgingly praised Chamberlain for intimidating the Celtics into taking low percentage shots from further outside . In Game 3 , Chamberlain grabbed 41 rebounds and helped the Sixers win 115 – 104 . The Celtics prevented a sweep by winning Game 4 with a 121 – 117 victory , but in Game 5 , the Sixers simply overpowered the Celtics 140 – 116 , which effectively ended Boston 's historic run of eight consecutive NBA titles . The Sixers ' center scored 29 points , 36 rebounds and 13 assists and was highly praised by Celtics Russell and K.C. Jones . 
 In the 1967 NBA Finals , the Sixers were pitted against Chamberlain 's old team , the San Francisco Warriors of his one @-@ time backup Nate Thurmond and star forward Rick Barry . The Sixers won the first two games , with Chamberlain and Greer taking credit for respectively defensive dominance and clutch shooting , but San Francisco won two of the next three games , so Philadelphia was up 3 – 2 prior to Game 6 . In Game 6 , the Warriors were trailing 123 – 122 with 15 seconds left . For the last play , Thurmond and Barry were assigned to do a pick and roll against Chamberlain and whoever would guard Barry . However , the Sixers foiled it : when Barry ran past Thurmond 's pick and drove to the basket , he was picked up by Chet Walker , making it impossible to shoot ; Thurmond was covered by Chamberlain , which made it impossible to pass . Barry botched his shot attempt , and the Sixers won the championship . Chamberlain said : " It is wonderful to be a part of the greatest team in basketball ... being a champion is like having a big round glow inside of you . " He contributed with 17 @.@ 7 ppg and 28 @.@ 7 rpg against fellow future Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame pivot Nate Thurmond , never failing to snare at least 23 rebounds in the six games . Chamberlain himself described the team as the best in NBA history . In 2002 , writer Wayne Lynch wrote a book about this remarkable Sixers season , Season of the 76ers , centering on Chamberlain . 
 In the 1967 – 68 NBA season , matters began to turn sour between Chamberlain and the Sixers ' sole surviving owner , Irv Kosloff . This conflict had been going along for a while : in 1965 , Chamberlain asserted that he and the late Richman had worked out a deal which would give the center 25 % of the franchise once he ended his career . Although there is no written proof for or against , ex @-@ Sixers coach Dolph Schayes and Sixers lawyer Alan Levitt assumed Chamberlain was right ; in any case , Kosloff declined the request , leaving Chamberlain livid and willing to jump to the rival ABA once his contract ended in 1967 . Kosloff and Chamberlain worked out a truce , and later signed a one @-@ year , $ 250 @,@ 000 contract . 
 On the hardwood , Chamberlain continued his focus on team play and registered 24 @.@ 3 points and 23 @.@ 8 rebounds a game for the season . The 76ers had the best record in the league for the third straight season . Chamberlain made history by becoming the only center in NBA history to finish the season as the leader in assists , his 702 beating runner @-@ up , Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame point guard Lenny Wilkens ' total by 23 . Chamberlain likened his assist title to legendary home run hitter " Babe Ruth leading the league in sacrifice bunts " , and he dispelled the myth that he could not and would not pass the ball . For these feats , Chamberlain won his fourth and last MVP title . Another landmark was his <unk> point , making him the first ever player to score these many points : he gave the ball to his team physician Dr. Stan Lorber . Winning 62 games , the Sixers easily took the first playoff berth of the 1968 NBA Playoffs . In the 1968 Eastern Division Semifinals , they were pitted against the Knicks . In a physically tough matchup , the Sixers lost sixth man Billy Cunningham with a broken hand , and Chamberlain , Greer and Jackson were struggling with inflamed feet , bad knees , and pulled hamstrings respectively . Going ahead 3 – 2 , the Sixers defeated the Knicks 115 – 97 in Game 6 after Chamberlain scored 25 points and 27 rebounds : he had a successful series in which he led both teams in points ( 153 ) , rebounds ( 145 ) and assists ( 38 ) . 
 In the 1968 Eastern Division Finals , the Sixers yet again met the Boston Celtics , again with home court advantage , and this time as reigning champions . Despite the Sixers ' injury woes , coach Hannum was confident to " take the Celtics in less than seven games " : he pointed out the age of the Celtics , who were built around Bill Russell and guard Sam Jones , both 34 . But then , national tragedy struck as Martin Luther King was assassinated on April 4 , 1968 . With eight of the ten starting players on the Sixers and Celtics being African @-@ American , both teams were in deep shock , and there were calls to cancel the series . In a game called " unreal " and " devoid of emotion " , the Sixers lost 127 – 118 on April 5 . After attending Dr. King 's funeral , Chamberlain called out to the angry rioters who were setting fires all over the country , stating Dr. King would not have approved . In Game 2 , Philadelphia evened the series with a 115 – 106 victory , and won Games 3 and 4 , with Chamberlain suspiciously often played by Celtics backup center Wayne Embry , causing the press to speculate Russell was worn down . Prior to Game 5 , the Celtics seemed dead : no NBA team had overcome a 3 – 1 series deficit before . However , the Celtics rallied back , winning Games 5 and 6 122 – 104 and 114 – 106 respectively , powered by a spirited John Havlicek and helped by the Sixers ' terrible shooting . 
 What followed was the first of three consecutive controversial and painful Game 7s in which Chamberlain played . In that Game 7 , the Sixers could not get their act together : 15 @,@ 202 stunned Philadelphia fans witnessed a historic 100 – 96 defeat , making it the first time in NBA history a team lost a series after leading three games to one . Although Cherry points out that the Sixers shot badly ( Hal Greer , Wali Jones , Chet Walker , Luke Jackson and Matt <unk> hit a combined 25 of 74 shots ) and Chamberlain grabbed 34 rebounds and shot 4 @-@ of @-@ 9 , the center himself scored only 14 points . In the second half of Game 7 , Chamberlain did not attempt a single shot from the field . Cherry observes a strange pattern in that game : in a typical Sixers game , Chamberlain got the ball 60 times in the low post , but only 23 times in Game 7 , and only seven times in the third and only twice in the fourth quarter . Chamberlain later blamed coach Hannum for the lack of touches , a point which the coach conceded himself , but Cherry points out that Chamberlain , who always thought of himself as the best player of all time , should have been outspoken enough to demand the ball himself . The loss meant that Chamberlain was now 1 – 6 in playoff series against the Celtics . 
 After that season , coach Alex Hannum wanted to be closer to his family on the West Coast ; he left the Sixers to coach the Oakland Oaks in the newly founded American Basketball Association . Chamberlain then asked for a trade , and Sixers general manager Jack Ramsay traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Darrall Imhoff , Archie Clark and Jerry Chambers . The motivation for this move remains in dispute . According to sportswriter Roland Lazenby , a journalist close to the Lakers , Chamberlain was angry at Kosloff for breaking the alleged Richman @-@ Chamberlain deal , but according to Dr. Jack Ramsay , who was the Sixers general manager then , Chamberlain also threatened to jump to the ABA after Hannum left , and forced the trade himself . Cherry finally adds several personal reasons : the center felt he had grown too big for Philadelphia , sought the presence of fellow celebrities ( which were plenty in L.A. ) and finally also desired the opportunity to date white women , which was possible for a black man in L.A. but hard to imagine elsewhere back then . 
 = = = Los Angeles Lakers ( 1968 – 1973 ) = = = 
 On July 9 , 1968 , Chamberlain was the centerpiece of a major trade between the 76ers and the Los Angeles Lakers , who sent center Darrall Imhoff , forward Jerry Chambers and guard Archie Clark to Philadelphia , making it the first time a reigning NBA Most Valuable Player was traded the next season . Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke gave Chamberlain an unprecedented contract , paying him $ 250 @,@ 000 after taxes ( about $ 1 @.@ 7 million in real value ) ; in comparison , previous Lakers top earner Jerry West was paid $ 100 @,@ 000 before taxes ( about $ 680 @,@ 000 in real value ) . 
 Chamberlain joined a squad which featured Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame forward Elgin Baylor and Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame guard Jerry West , along with backup center Mel Counts , forwards Keith Erickson and Tom Hawkins and talented 5 ' 11 " guard Johnny Egan . The lack of a second guard next to West ( and thus , the lack of speed and quickness ) concerned coach Butch Van Breda Kolff ; after losing Clark and Gail Goodrich , who joined the Phoenix Suns after the 1968 expansion draft , he said : " Egan gets murdered on defense because of his [ lack of ] size ... but if I don 't play him , we look like a bunch of trucks . " In addition , Cherry observed that Chamberlain was neither a natural leader nor a loyal follower , which made him difficult to fit in . While he was on cordial terms with Jerry West , he often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor ; regarding Baylor , he later explained : " We were good friends , but ... [ in ] black culture ... you never let the other guy one @-@ up you . " The greatest problem was his tense relationship with Lakers coach Butch Van Breda Kolff : pejoratively calling the new recruit " The Load " , he later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical , never respected him , too often slacked off in practice and focused too much on his own statistics . In return , the center blasted Van Breda Kolff as " the dumbest and worst coach ever " . Laker Keith Erickson observed that " Butch catered to Elgin and Jerry ... and that is not a good way to get on Wilt 's side ... that relationship was doomed from the start . " 
 Chamberlain experienced a problematic and often frustrating season . Van Breda Kolff benched him several times , which never happened in his career before ; in mid @-@ season , the perennial scoring champion had two games in which he scored only six and then only two points . Playing through his problems , Chamberlain averaged 20 @.@ 5 points and 21 @.@ 1 rebounds a game that season . However , Jack Kent Cooke was pleased , because since acquiring Chamberlain , ticket sales went up by 11 % . 
 In the 1969 NBA Playoffs , the Lakers dispatched Chamberlain 's old club , the San Francisco Warriors 4 – 2 after losing the first two games , and then defeated the Atlanta Hawks and met Chamberlain 's familiar rivals , Bill Russell 's Boston Celtics . Going into the series as 3 @-@ to @-@ 1 favorites , the Lakers won the first two games , but dropped the next two . Chamberlain was criticized as a non @-@ factor in the series , getting neutralized by Bill Russell with little effort . But in Game 5 , the Lakers center scored 13 points and grabbed 31 rebounds , leading Los Angeles to a 117 – 104 win . In Game 6 , the Celtics won 99 – 90 , and Chamberlain only scored eight points ; Cherry accuses him of choking , because if " Chamberlain had come up big and put up a normal 30 point scoring night " , L.A. would have probably won its first championship . 
 Game 7 featured a surreal scene : in anticipation of a Lakers win , Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke put up thousands of balloons in the rafters of the Forum in Los Angeles . This display of arrogance motivated the Celtics . In Game 7 , the Lakers trailed 91 – 76 after three quarters . The Lakers mounted a comeback ; then Chamberlain twisted his knee after a rebound and had to be replaced by Mel Counts . With three minutes to go the Lakers trailed 103 – 102 . The Lakers committed costly turnovers and lost the game 108 – 106 , despite a triple @-@ double from West , who had 42 points , 13 rebounds and 12 assists . West became the only player in NBA history to be named Finals MVP despite being on the losing team . 
 After the game , many wondered why Chamberlain sat out the final six minutes . At the time of his final substitution , he had scored 18 points ( hitting seven of his eight shots ) and grabbed 27 rebounds , significantly better than the 10 points of Mel Counts on 4 @-@ of @-@ 13 shooting . Among others , Bill Russell didn 't believe Chamberlain 's injury was grave , and openly accused him of being a <unk> : " Any injury short of a broken leg or a broken back is not enough . " Ironically , Van Breda Kolff came to Chamberlain 's defense , insisting the often @-@ maligned Lakers center hardly was able to move in the end . He himself was perceived as " pig @-@ headed " for benching Chamberlain , and soon resigned as Lakers coach . Cherry comments that according to some journalists , that Game 7 " destroyed two careers : Wilt 's because he wouldn 't take over and Van Breda Kolff because he wouldn 't give in " . 
 In his second year with the Lakers under new coach Joe Mullaney , Chamberlain seriously injured his knee . He was injured in the ninth game of the schedule , suffering a total rupture of the patellar tendon at the base of his right kneecap , and missed the next several months before appearing in the final three games of the 82 @-@ game regular season . Owing to a great start , he managed to average 27 @.@ 3 points , 18 @.@ 4 rebounds and 4 @.@ 1 assists per game . Again , the Lakers charged through the playoffs , and in the 1970 NBA Finals , the Lakers were pitted against the New York Knicks , loaded with future Hall @-@ of @-@ Famers Willis Reed , Dave DeBusschere , Bill Bradley , and Walt Frazier . Cherry observed that Reed , a prolific midrange shooter , was a bad matchup for Chamberlain : having lost lateral quickness due to his injury , the Lakers center was often too slow to block Reed 's preferred high post jump shots . In Game 1 , New York masterminded a 124 – 112 win in which Reed scored 37 points . In Game 2 , Chamberlain scored 19 points , grabbed 24 rebounds , and blocked Reed 's shot in the final seconds , leading the Lakers to a 105 – 103 win . Game 3 saw Jerry West famously hit a 60 @-@ foot shot at the buzzer to tie the game at 102 ; however , the Knicks took the game 111 – 108 . In Game 4 , Chamberlain scored 18 points and grabbed 25 rebounds and helped tie the series at 2 . In Game 5 , with the Knicks trailing by double digits , Reed pulled his thigh muscle and seemed to be done for the series . By conventional wisdom , Chamberlain now should have dominated against little @-@ used Knicks backup centers Nate Bowman and Bill <unk> or forwards Bradley and DeBusschere , who gave up more than half a foot against the Lakers center . Instead , the Lakers gave away their 13 @-@ point halftime lead and succumbed to the aggressive Knicks defense : L.A. committed 19 second half turnovers , and the two main scorers Chamberlain and West shot the ball only three and two times , respectively , in the entire second half . The Lakers lost 107 – 100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history . In Game 6 , Chamberlain scored 45 points and almost single @-@ handedly equalized the series in a 135 – 113 Lakers win , and with Reed out , the Knicks seemed doomed prior to Game 7 in New York . 
 However , the hero of that Game 7 was Willis Reed . He famously hobbled up court , scored the first four points , and inspired his team to one of the most famous playoff upsets of all time . The Knicks led by 27 at halftime , and despite scoring 21 points , Chamberlain couldn 't prevent a third consecutive loss in a Game 7 . The Lakers center himself was criticized for his inability to dominate his injured counterpart , but Cherry pointed out that Chamberlain 's feat – coming back from a career @-@ threatening injury himself – was too quickly forgotten . 
 In the 1970 – 71 NBA season , the Lakers made a notable move by signing future Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame guard Gail Goodrich , who came back from the Phoenix Suns after playing for L.A. until 1968 . Chamberlain averaged 20 @.@ 7 points , 18 @.@ 2 rebounds and 4 @.@ 3 assists , once again led the NBA in rebounding and the Lakers won the Pacific Division title . After losing Elgin Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career , and especially after losing Jerry West after a knee injury , the handicapped Lakers were seen as underdogs against the Milwaukee Bucks of freshly crowned MVP Lew Alcindor , and veteran Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame guard Oscar Robertson in the Western Conference Finals . Winning the regular season with 66 wins , the Bucks were seen as favourites against the depleted Lakers ; still , many pundits were looking forward to the matchup between the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Chamberlain and the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Alcindor . In Game 1 , Abdul @-@ Jabbar outscored Chamberlain 32 – 22 , and the Bucks won 106 – 85 . In Game 2 , the Bucks won again despite the Lakers center scoring 26 points , four more than his Milwaukee counterpart . Prior to Game 3 , things became even worse for the Lakers when Keith Erickson , West 's stand @-@ in , had an appendectomy and was out for the season ; with rookie Jim McMillian easing the scoring pressure , Chamberlain scored 24 points and grabbed 24 rebounds in a 118 – 107 victory , but the Bucks defeated the Lakers 117 – 94 in Game 4 to take a 3 – 1 series lead . Milwaukee closed out the series at home with a 116 – 98 victory in Game 5 . Although Chamberlain lost , he was lauded for holding his own against MVP Alcindor , who was not only 10 years younger , but healthy . 
 After the 1971 playoffs , Chamberlain had yet another offer to fight heavyweight boxing legend Muhammad Ali . The 15 @-@ round fight would have taken place on July 26 , 1971 in the Houston Astrodome but Chamberlain refused . The potential Chamberlain @-@ Ali match was predicated on Ali beating Joe Frazier in a fight scheduled for early 1971 . However , Frazier defeated Ali to hand Ali his first professional loss . As a result , Chamberlain declined the fight through a contractual escape clause . In a 1999 interview , Chamberlain stated that boxing trainer <unk> D 'Amato wanted to train him for the fight , and they offered Ali and him $ 5 million each to battle each other . Chamberlain checked back with his father and finally said no . Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had also offered Chamberlain a record @-@ setting contract on the condition that Chamberlain agree to give up what Cooke termed " this boxing foolishness . " This was not the first time a Chamberlain @-@ Ali fight had been explored , as offers had also been made in both 1965 and 1967 . In 1967 , recently retired NFL star Jim Brown acted as Chamberlain 's manager , but Ali 's manager Jabir Herbert Muhammad backed out of the Chamberlain @-@ Ali match which was slated to take place at Madison Square Garden . 
 In the 1971 – 72 NBA season , the Lakers hired former Celtics star guard Bill Sharman as head coach . Sharman introduced morning shoot @-@ arounds , in which the perennial latecomer Chamberlain regularly participated ( in contrast to earlier years with Dolph Schayes ) and transformed him into a defensive @-@ minded , low @-@ scoring post defender in the mold of his old rival Bill Russell . Furthermore , he told Chamberlain to use his rebounding and passing skills to quickly initiate <unk> to his teammates . 
 While no longer being the main scorer , Chamberlain was named the new captain of the Lakers : after rupturing his Achilles tendon , perennial captain Elgin Baylor retired , leaving a void the center now filled . Initially , Sharman wanted Chamberlain and West to share this duty , but West declined , stating he was injury @-@ prone and wanted to solely concentrate on the game . Chamberlain accepted his new roles and posted an all @-@ time low 14 @.@ 8 points , but also won the rebound crown with 19 @.@ 2 rpg and led the league with a .649 field goal percentage . Powered by his defensive presence , the Lakers embarked on an unprecedented 33 @-@ game win streak en route to a then @-@ record 69 wins in the regular season . Yet the streak led to one strangely dissonant event . According to Flynn Robinson , after the record @-@ setting streak , Lakers owner Cooke sought to reward each of his players — who were expecting perhaps a " trip to Hawaii " — with a $ 5 pen set . In response , Chamberlain " had everybody put all the pens in the middle of the floor and stepped on them . " 
 In the post @-@ season , the Lakers swept the Chicago Bulls , then went on to face the Milwaukee Bucks of young superstar center and regular @-@ season MVP Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar ( formerly Lew Alcindor ) . The matchup between Chamberlain and Abdul @-@ Jabbar was hailed by LIFE magazine as the greatest matchup in all of sports . Chamberlain would help lead the Lakers past Abdul @-@ Jabbar and the Bucks in six games . Particularly , Chamberlain was lauded for his performance in Game 6 , which the Lakers won 104 – 100 after trailing by 10 points in the fourth quarter : he scored 24 points and 22 rebounds , played all 48 minutes and outsprinted the younger Bucks center on several late Lakers fast breaks . Jerry West called it " the greatest ball @-@ busting performance I have ever seen . " Chamberlain performed so well in the series that TIME magazine stated , " In the N.B.A. ' s western division title series with Milwaukee , he ( Chamberlain ) decisively outplayed basketball 's newest giant superstar , Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar , eleven years his junior . " 
 In the 1972 NBA Finals , the Lakers again met the New York Knicks ; the Knicks were shorthanded after losing 6 ' 9 " Willis Reed to injury , and so , undersized 6 ' 8 " Jerry Lucas had the task to defend against the 7 ' 1 " Chamberlain . However , prolific outside shooter Lucas helped New York to win Game 1 , hitting nine of his 11 shots in the first half alone ; in Game 2 , which the Lakers won 106 – 92 , Chamberlain put Lucas into foul trouble , and the Knicks lost defensive power forward Dave DeBusschere to injury . In Game 3 , Chamberlain scored 26 points and grabbed 20 rebounds for another Lakers win , and in a fiercely battled Game 4 , the Lakers center was playing with five fouls late in the game . Having never fouled out in his career – a feat that he was very proud of – he played aggressive defense despite the risk of fouling out , and blocked two of Lucas ' shots in overtime , proving those wrong who said he only played for his own stats ; he ended scoring a game @-@ high 27 points . But in that game , he fell on his right hand , and was said to have " sprained " it ; it was actually broken . For Game 5 , Chamberlain 's hands were packed into thick pads normally destined for defensive linesmen in American Football ; he was offered a painkilling shot , but refused because he feared he would lose his shooting touch if his hands became numb . In Game 5 , Chamberlain recorded 24 points , 29 rebounds , eight assists and eight blocked shots . ( While blocked shots were not an official NBA stat at that time , announcer Keith Jackson counted the blocks during the broadcast . ) Chamberlain 's outstanding all @-@ around performance helped the Lakers win their first championship in Los Angeles with a decisive 114 – 100 win . Chamberlain was named Finals MVP , and was admired for dominating the Knicks in Game 5 while playing injured . 
 The 1972 – 73 NBA season was to be Chamberlain 's last , although he didn 't know this at the time . In his last season , the Lakers lost substance : Happy Hairston was injured , Flynn Robinson and LeRoy Ellis had left , and veteran Jerry West struggled with injury . Chamberlain averaged 13 @.@ 2 points and 18 @.@ 6 rebounds , still enough to win the rebounding crown for the 11th time in his career . In addition , he shot an NBA record <unk> % for the season , bettering his own mark of .683 from the 1966 – 67 season . It was the ninth time Chamberlain would lead the league in field goal percentage . The Lakers won 60 games in the regular season and reached the 1973 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks . This time , the tables were turned : the Knicks now featured a healthy team with a rejuvenated Willis Reed , and the Lakers were now handicapped by several injuries . 
 In that series , the Lakers won Game 1 115 – 112 , but the Knicks won Games 2 and 3 ; things worsened when Jerry West injured his hamstring yet again . In Game 4 , the shorthanded Lakers were no match for New York , and in Game 5 , the valiant , but injured West and Hairston had miserable games , and despite Chamberlain scoring 23 points and grabbing 21 rebounds , the Lakers lost 102 – 93 and the series . After the Knicks finished off the close fifth game with a late flourish led by Earl Monroe and Phil Jackson , Chamberlain made a dunk with one second left , which turned out to be the last play of his NBA career . 
 = = = San Diego Conquistadors ( 1973 ) = = = 
 In 1973 , the San Diego Conquistadors of the NBA rival league ABA signed Chamberlain as a player @-@ coach for a $ 600 @,@ 000 salary . However , the Lakers sued their former star and successfully prevented him from actually playing , because he still owed them the option year of his contract . Barred from playing , Chamberlain mostly left the coaching duties to his assistant Stan Albeck , who recalled : " Chamberlain ... has a great feel for pro basketball ... [ but ] the day @-@ to @-@ day things that are an important part of basketball ... just bored him . He did not have the patience . " The players were split on Chamberlain , who was seen as competent , but often indifferent and more occupied with promotion of his autobiography Wilt : Just Like Any Other 7 @-@ Foot Black Millionaire Who Lives Next Door than with coaching . He once skipped a game to sign autographs for the book . In his single season as a coach , the Conquistadors went a mediocre 37 – 47 in the regular season and lost against the Utah Stars in the Division Semifinals . However , Chamberlain was not pleased by the Qs ' meager attendance : crowds averaged 1 @,@ 843 , just over half of the Qs ' small San Diego 3 @,@ 200 @-@ seat sports arena . After the season , Chamberlain retired from professional basketball .

 After his stint with the Conquistadors , Chamberlain successfully went into business and entertainment , made money in stocks and real estate , bought a popular Harlem nightclub , which he renamed Big Wilt 's Smalls Paradise , and invested in broodmares . Chamberlain also sponsored his personal professional volleyball and track and field teams , and also provided high @-@ level teams for girls and women in basketball , track , volleyball and softball , and made money by appearing in ads for TWA , American Express , Volkswagen , Drexel Burnham , Le Tigre Clothing and Foot Locker . 
 After his basketball career , volleyball became Chamberlain 's new passion : being a talented hobby <unk> during his Lakers days , he became board member of the newly founded International Volleyball Association in 1974 and became its president one year later . As a testament to his importance , the IVA All @-@ Star game was televised only because Chamberlain also played in it : he rose to the challenge and was named the game 's MVP . He played occasional matches for the IVA Seattle Smashers before the league folded in 1979 . Chamberlain promoted the sport so effectively that he was named to the Volleyball Hall of Fame : he became one of the few athletes who were enshrined in different sports . 
 In 1976 Wilt turned to his interest in movies , forming a film production and distribution company to make his first film , entitled " Go For It " . 
 Starting in the 1970s , he formed Wilt 's Athletic Club , a track and field club in southern California , coached by then UCLA assistant coach Bob Kersee in the early days of his career . Among the members of the team were : Florence Griffith before she set the current world records in the 100 meters and 200 meters ; Three time world champion Greg Foster ; future Olympic Gold medalists Andre Phillips ; Alice Brown ; Jeanette Bolden . In all , he claimed 60 athletes with aspirations of expanding to 100 . While actively promoting the sport in 1982 , Chamberlain claimed he was considering a return to athletic competition , but not in basketball , in Masters athletics . At the time he claimed he had only been beaten in the high jump once , by Olympic champion Charles Dumas , and that he had never been beaten in the shot put , including beating Olympic legend Al <unk> . 
 Chamberlain played a villainous warrior and counterpart of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film Conan the Destroyer ( 1984 ) . 
 In November 1998 , Wilt signed with Ian Ng Cheng Hin , CEO of Northern Cinema House Entertainment ( NCH Entertainment ) , to do his own bio @-@ pic , wanting to tell his life story his way . He had been working on the screenplay notes for over a year at the time of his death . " He was more inquisitive than anybody I ever knew . He was writing a screenplay about his life . He was interested in world affairs , sometimes he 'd call me up late at night and discuss philosophy . I think he 'll be remembered as a great man . He happened to make a living playing basketball but he was more than that . He could talk on any subject . He was a Goliath , " said Sy Goldberg , Chamberlain 's longtime attorney . 
 When million @-@ dollar contracts became common in the NBA , Chamberlain increasingly felt he had been underpaid during his career . A result of this resentment was the 1997 book Who 's Running the Asylum ? Inside the Insane World of Sports Today ( 1997 ) , in which he harshly criticized the NBA of the 1990s for being too disrespectful of players of the past . 
 Even far beyond his playing days , Chamberlain was a very fit person . In his mid @-@ forties , he was able to humble rookie Magic Johnson in practice , and even in the 1980s , he flirted with making a comeback in the NBA . In the 1980 – 81 NBA season , coach Larry Brown recalled that the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Chamberlain had received an offer from the Cleveland Cavaliers . When Chamberlain was 50 , the New Jersey Nets had the same idea , and Chamberlain declined again . However , he would continue to epitomize physical fitness for years to come , including participating in several marathons .

 Chamberlain is regarded as one of the most extraordinary and dominant basketball players in the history of the NBA . The 1972 NBA Finals MVP is holder of numerous official NBA all @-@ time records , establishing himself as a scoring champion , all @-@ time top rebounder and accurate field goal shooter . He led the NBA in scoring seven times , field goal percentage nine times , minutes played eight times , rebounding eleven times , and assists once . He was also responsible for several rule changes , including widening the lane from 12 to 16 feet , as well as changes to rules regarding <unk> the ball and shooting free throws . Chamberlain is most remembered for his 100 @-@ point game , which is widely considered one of basketball 's greatest records . Decades after his record , many NBA teams did not even average 100 points as fewer field goals per game were being attempted . The closest any player has gotten to 100 points was the Los Angeles Lakers ' Kobe Bryant , who scored 81 in 2006 . Bryant afterwards said Chamberlain 's record was " unthinkable ... It 's pretty exhausting to think about it . " Chamberlain 's main weakness was his notoriously poor free throw shooting , where he has the third lowest career free throw percentage in NBA history with 51 @.@ 1 % ( based on a minimum of 1 @,@ 200 attempts ) . Chamberlain claimed that he intentionally missed free throws so a teammate could get the rebound and score two points instead of one , but later acknowledged that he was a " psycho case " in this matter . On the other hand , he committed surprisingly few fouls during his NBA career , despite the rugged play in the post . Chamberlain never fouled out of a regular season or playoff game in his 14 @-@ year NBA career . His career average was only two fouls per game , despite having averaged 45 @.@ 8 minutes per game over his career . He had five seasons where he committed less than two fouls per game , with a career low of 1 @.@ 5 fouls during the 1962 season , in which he also averaged 50 @.@ 4 points per game . His fouls per 36 minutes ( a stat used to compare players that average vastly different minutes ) was a remarkable 1 @.@ 6 per game . " First he was a scorer . Then he was a rebounder and assist man . Then with our great Laker team in 1972 , he concentrated on the defensive end , " said Sharman . In his two championship seasons , Chamberlain led the league in rebounding , while his scoring decreased to 24 and 15 points per game . By 1971 – 72 at age 35 and running less , his game had transformed to averaging only nine shots per game , compared to the 40 in his record @-@ setting 1961 – 62 season . He also has a signature ' Dipper ' move , whereby he would fake a hook shot , and extends his arm to a short @-@ range finger roll to shoot under a block attempt . 
 For his feats , Chamberlain was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978 , named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History , ranked # 2 in SLAM Magazine 's Top 50 NBA Players of All @-@ Time and # 13 in the ESPN list " Top North American athletes of the century " and voted the second best center of All @-@ Time by ESPN behind Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar on March 6 , 2007 . During his career , Chamberlain competed against future Hall of Famers including Russell , Thurmond , Lucas , and Walt Bellamy . He later faced Unseld , Abdul @-@ Jabbar , Dave Cowens , and Elvin Hayes . 
 = = = Chamberlain – Russell rivalry = = = 
 From a historical NBA perspective , the rivalry between Chamberlain and his perennial nemesis Bill Russell is cited as the greatest on @-@ court rivalry of all time . There were three NBA Finals matchups in the rivalry between Larry Bird and Magic Johnson , but they played different positions and did not guard each other . Russell 's Celtics won seven of eight playoff series against Chamberlain 's Warriors , 76ers , and Lakers teams , and went 57 – 37 against them in the regular season and 29 – 20 in the playoffs . Russell 's teams won all four seventh games against Chamberlain 's — the combined margin was nine points . Chamberlain outscored Russell 30 to 14 @.@ 2 per game and outrebounded him 28 @.@ 2 to 22 @.@ 9 in the regular season , and also in the playoffs , he outscored him 25 @.@ 7 to 14 @.@ 9 and outrebounded him 28 to 24 @.@ 7 . The comparison between the two is often simplified to a great player ( Chamberlain ) versus a player who makes his team great ( Russell ) , an individualist against a team player . In 1961 – 62 when Chamberlain averaged 50 @.@ 4 points per game , he noted that Boston did not rely on Russell 's scoring , and he could concentrate on defense and rebounding . He wished people would understand that their roles were different . Chamberlain said , " I 've got to hit forty points or so , or this team is in trouble . I must score — understand ? After that I play defense and get the ball off the boards . I try to do them all , best I can , but scoring comes first . " Russell won 11 NBA titles in his career while Chamberlain won two . Chamberlain was named All @-@ NBA first team seven times to Russell 's three , but Russell was named league MVP — then selected by players and not the press — five times against Chamberlain 's four . 
 Russell and Chamberlain were friends in private life . Russell never considered Chamberlain his rival and disliked the term , instead pointing out that they rarely talked about basketball when they were alone . When Chamberlain died in 1999 , Chamberlain 's nephew stated that Russell was the second person he was ordered to break the news to . The two did not speak for two decades after Russell criticized Chamberlain after Game 7 of the 1969 Finals . Russell apologized privately to Chamberlain and later publicly . 
 = = = Rule changes = = = 
 Chamberlain 's impact on the game is also reflected in the fact that he was directly responsible for several rule changes in the NBA , including widening the lane to try to keep him farther away from the hoop , instituting offensive goaltending and revising rules governing <unk> the ball and shooting free throws ( such as making it against the rules to inbound the ball over the backboard ) . Chamberlain , who reportedly had a 50 @-@ inch vertical leap , was physically capable of converting foul shots via a slam dunk without a running start ( beginning his movement at the top of the key ) . When his dunks practically undermined the difficulty of a foul shot , both the NCAA and the NBA banned his modus operandi . In basketball history , pundits have stated that the only other player who forced such a massive change of rules is 6 ' 10 " Minneapolis Lakers center George Mikan , who played a decade before Chamberlain and also caused many rule changes designed to thwart so @-@ called " big men " . 
 = = = Reputation = = = 
 Although Chamberlain racked up some of the most impressive statistics in the history of Northern American professional sports , because he won " just " two NBA championships and lost seven out of eight playoff series against the Celtics teams of his on @-@ court nemesis Bill Russell , Chamberlain was often called " selfish " and a " loser " . Frank Deford of ESPN said that Chamberlain was caught in a no @-@ win situation : " If you win , everybody says , ' Well , look at him , he 's that big . ' If you lose , everybody says , ' How could he lose , a guy that size ? ' " Chamberlain himself often said : " Nobody roots for Goliath . " 
 Like later superstar Shaquille O 'Neal , Chamberlain was a target of criticism because of his poor free throw shooting , an abysmal <unk> career average , with a low of .380 over the 1967 – 68 season . Countless suggestions were offered ; he shot them underhanded , one @-@ handed , two @-@ handed , from the side of the circle , from well behind the line , and even banked in . Sixers coach Alex Hannum once suggested he shoot his famous fadeaway jumper as a free throw , but Chamberlain feared drawing more attention to his one great failing . Despite his foul line woes , Chamberlain set the NBA record ( 28 ) for free throws made in a regular season game in his 1962 100 @-@ point game . 
 Furthermore , Chamberlain damaged his reputation in an April 1965 article with Sports Illustrated . In an interview entitled " My Life in a Bush League " , he criticized his fellow players , coaches , and NBA administrators . Chamberlain later commented that he could see in hindsight how the interview could have been instrumental in hurting his public image . 
 However , contemporary colleagues were often terrified to play against Chamberlain . Bill Russell regularly feared being embarrassed by Chamberlain , Walt Frazier called his dominance on the court " comical " , and when 6 ft 11 in 250 @-@ pound ( in his early years ) Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame center Bob Lanier was asked about the most memorable moment of his career , Lanier answered : " When Wilt Chamberlain lifted me up and moved me like a coffee cup so he could get a favorable position . "

 = = = Star status = = = 
 Wilt Chamberlain was the first big earner of basketball : immediately becoming the highest paid player upon entering the NBA , Chamberlain was basketball 's first player to earn at least $ 100 @,@ 000 a year , and earned an unprecedented $ 1 @.@ 5 million during his Lakers years . As a Philadelphia <unk> , he could afford to rent a New York apartment and commute to Philadelphia . In addition , he would often stay out late into the night and wake up at noon , a point that became notorious in the 1965 – 66 NBA season . 
 When he became a Laker , Chamberlain built a million @-@ dollar mansion he called the " Ursa Major " in Bel @-@ Air , as a play on his nickname " The Big Dipper " . It had a 2 @,@ 200 @-@ pound pivot as a front door and contained great displays of luxury . Robert Allen Cherry , journalist and author of the biography Wilt : Larger than Life , describes his house as a miniature Playboy Mansion , where he regularly held parties and lived out his later @-@ notorious sex life . This was also helped by the fact that Chamberlain was a near @-@ insomniac who often simply skipped sleeping . Designed according to his preferences , the house was constructed with no right angles , and had an " X @-@ rated " room with mirrored walls and a fur @-@ covered <unk> . Chamberlain lived alone , relying on a great deal of automated gadgets , with two cats named Zip and Zap and several Great Dane dogs as company . In addition , Chamberlain drove a Ferrari , a Bentley , and had a Le Mans @-@ style car called Searcher One designed and built at a cost of $ 750 @,@ 000 in 1996 . Following his death , in 2000 Chamberlain 's estate was valued at $ 25 million . 
 = = = Love life = = = 
 Although shy and insecure as a teenager , adult Chamberlain became well known for his womanizing . As his lawyer Seymour " Sy " Goldberg put it : " Some people collect stamps , Wilt collected women . " Swedish Olympic high jumper Annette <unk> , who met him when he was 40 and she 19 , remembers him as a pick @-@ up artist who was extremely confident yet respectful : " I think Wilt hit on everything that moved ... [ but ] he never was bad or rude . " Many of Chamberlain 's personal friends testified that he once had 23 women in 10 days , had no problems organizing a threesome ( or more ) , and particularly enjoyed a TV skit on the television show In Living Color in which a mother and her daughter approach a Vietnam Wall @-@ like list of women who slept with him , both of them pointing out that their names are on it , as well as a 1991 Saturday Night Live sketch where MC Hammer played Chamberlain in " Remembrances of Love " , where Chamberlain spoofs a soap opera with romances with women that are usually over in five minutes . However , Los Angeles Times columnist David Shaw claimed that during a dinner with Shaw and his wife , Chamberlain was " rude and sexist toward his own date , as he usually was " , adding that at one point Chamberlain left the table to get the phone number of an attractive woman at a nearby table . 
 According to Rod <unk> , a contemporary of Wilt 's , Chamberlain documented his love life using a Day @-@ Timer . Every time Chamberlain went to bed with a different woman , he put a check in his Day @-@ Timer . Over a 10 day period , there were 23 checks in the book , which would be a rate of 2 @.@ 3 women per day . Chamberlain divided that number in half , to be conservative and to correct for degrees of variation . He then multiplied that number by the number of days he had been alive at the time minus 15 years . That was how the 20 @,@ 000 number came into existence . In response to public backlash regarding his promiscuity , Chamberlain later emphasized that " the point of using the number was to show that sex was a great part of my life as basketball was a great part of my life . That 's the reason why I was single . " 
 In a 1999 interview shortly before his death , Chamberlain regretted not having explained the sexual climate at the time of his escapades , and warned other men who admired him for it , closing with the words : " With all of you men out there who think that having a thousand different ladies is pretty cool , I have learned in my life I 've found out that having one woman a thousand different times is much more satisfying . " Chamberlain also acknowledged that he never came close to marrying and had no intention of raising any children . 
 = = = Relationships = = = 
 Although Cherry points out that Chamberlain was an egotist , he added that he had good relationships with many contemporaries and enjoyed a great deal of respect . He was especially lauded for his good rapport with his fans , often providing tickets and signing autographs . Dr. Jack Ramsay recalled that Chamberlain regularly took walks in downtown Philadelphia and acknowledged honking horns with the air of a man enjoying all the attention . Jerry West called him a " complex ... very nice person " , and NBA rival Jack McMahon even said : " The best thing that happened to the NBA is that God made Wilt a nice person ... he could have killed us all with his left hand . " Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy even assumed that if Chamberlain had been less fixated on being popular , he would have been meaner and able to win more titles . 
 During most of his NBA career , Chamberlain was good friends with Bill Russell . Chamberlain often invited Russell over to Thanksgiving , and at Russell 's place , conversation mostly concerned Russell 's electric trains . But as the championship count became increasingly lopsided , the relationship got strained , and turned hostile after Russell accused Chamberlain of " copping out " in the notorious Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals . The two men did not talk to each other for over 20 years , until Russell apologized privately , then publicly in a 1997 joint interview with Bob Costas : " There was a thing almost 30 years ago ... I was wrong . " Still , Chamberlain maintained a level of bitterness , regretted that he should have been " more physical " with Russell in their games and privately continued accusing his rival for " <unk> " basketball in a negative way . 
 More hostile was Chamberlain 's relationship with fellow center Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar , ten years his junior . Although Abdul @-@ Jabbar idolized him as a teenager and was once part of his inner circle , the student / mentor bond deteriorated into intense mutual loathing , especially after Chamberlain retired . Chamberlain often criticized Abdul @-@ Jabbar for a perceived lack of scoring , rebounding , and defense . Abdul @-@ Jabbar accused Chamberlain of being a traitor to the black race for his Republican political leanings , support of Richard Nixon , and relationships with white women . When Abdul @-@ Jabbar broke Chamberlain 's all @-@ time scoring record in 1984 , Chamberlain repeatedly called on Kareem to retire . When Abdul @-@ Jabbar published his autobiography in 1990 , he retaliated by writing a paper titled " To Wilt <unk> [ sic ] " in which he stated " Now that I am done playing , history will remember me as someone who helped teammates to win , while you will be remembered as a crybaby , a loser , and a quitter . " Their relationship remained mostly strained until the end .

 Chamberlain denounced the Black Panthers and other black nationalist movements in the late 1960s , and supported Republican Richard Nixon in the 1968 and 1972 presidential elections . Chamberlain accompanied Nixon to the funeral of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . He considered himself a Republican . 
 = = Death = = 
 Chamberlain had a history of heart trouble . In 1992 , Chamberlain was briefly hospitalized for an irregular heartbeat . According to those close to him , he eventually began taking medication for his heart troubles . In 1999 , his condition deteriorated rapidly . During this time , he lost 50 pounds . After undergoing dental surgery in the week before his death , he was in great pain and seemed unable to recover from the stress . On October 12 , 1999 , Chamberlain died in Bel @-@ Air , California , at the age of 63 . He was cremated . His agent Sy Goldberg stated Chamberlain died of congestive heart failure . He was survived by his sisters Barbara Lewis , Margaret Lane , Selina Gross and Yvonne Chamberlain , and brothers Wilbert and Oliver Chamberlain . 
 NBA players and officials were saddened at the loss of a player they universally remembered as a symbol of the sport . His lifelong on @-@ court rival and personal friend Bill Russell stated " the fierceness of our competition bonded us together for eternity " , and Celtics coach Red Auerbach praised Chamberlain as vital for the success of the entire NBA .

 The 2012 Scottish Cup Final was the 127th final of the Scottish Cup . The match took place at Hampden Park on 19 May 2012 and was contested by the Edinburgh derby rivals , Hibernian ( Hibs ) and Heart of Midlothian ( Hearts ) . It was Hibs ' 12th Scottish Cup Final and Hearts ' 14th . It was also the first time the clubs had met in a Scottish Cup Final since 1896 . 
 As Scottish Premier League ( SPL ) clubs , Hibs and Hearts both entered the competition in the fourth round . Hibs won all four of their ties at the first attempt , defeating two other SPL clubs and two Scottish Football League clubs . After winning against Junior club Auchinleck Talbot in the fourth round , Hearts defeated three other SPL clubs to reach the final . Hearts needed replays to eliminate St Johnstone and St Mirren , then beat cup holders Celtic in the semi @-@ final . 
 The match was Hibs ' 12th appearance in the Scottish Cup final and Hearts ' 14th . Hibs had previously won two finals and Hearts had won seven . Because both teams were from Edinburgh , many of the city councillors requested that the final be held in Edinburgh at Murrayfield Stadium , instead of the traditional venue of Hampden , in Glasgow . The previous final between the two clubs in 1896 had been held in Edinburgh but on this occasion it stayed in Glasgow . 
 Hearts won a one @-@ sided match 5 – 1 . They took an early 2 – 0 lead by goals from Darren Barr and Rudi Skácel . Hibs reduced the deficit to 2 – 1 at half @-@ time through captain James McPake . Soon after half @-@ time , however , Pa Kujabi was sent off and conceded a penalty kick , which was converted by Danny Grainger . Hearts scored two further goals with their one @-@ man advantage to complete the scoring .

 Scottish Premier League club Hibernian entered the competition in the fourth round . They began their campaign against Second Division leaders Cowdenbeath at Central Park , which was suggested as a possible cup upset due to Hibs ' poor league form . Cowdenbeath took the lead after just 15 seconds , but Hibs recovered to win 3 – 2 . Hibs then took on fellow SPL club Kilmarnock at their home ground , Easter Road , having made several signings in January 2012 . An early goal by Irish striker Eoin Doyle was enough to give Hibs a 1 – 0 win . 
 In the quarter @-@ final Hibs were drawn against the other senior club from Ayrshire , away to Ayr United . Again the match was tipped as a possible cup upset , as Ayr had beaten Hibs ( after a replay ) in the 2010 – 11 Scottish Cup competition . Hibs scored two early goals and progressed to the semi @-@ final with a 2 – 0 victory . In the semi @-@ final , Hibs took on Aberdeen at Hampden Park . Garry O 'Connor scored an early goal , and Rory Fallon equalised for Aberdeen in the second half with a spectacular looping volley . Hibs won 2 – 1 thanks to a late winning goal by Leigh Griffiths .

 Heart of Midlothian , also a Scottish Premier League club , entered the competition in the fourth round . They began their campaign against Junior club Auchinleck Talbot in a home match at Tynecastle Stadium . A late goal by Gordon Smith gave Hearts a 1 – 0 victory . Hearts then faced fellow SPL side St Johnstone in the fifth round . Hearts led 1 @-@ 0 after a David Templeton goal . Despite St Johnstone defender Dave Mackay being sent off after 74 minutes , Cillian Sheridan equalised to force a replay . In the replay , Murray Davidson put St Johnstone in the lead with an 83rd @-@ minute goal . Jamie Hamill then converted a controversial stoppage @-@ time penalty to force extra time . Suso Santana had won the penalty but was accused of diving by the St Johnstone players and manager . During extra time Marius Zaliukas scored the winning goal from a corner . 
 In the quarter final Hearts faced another SPL side , St Mirren . Hearts conceded early on after a Graham Carey free @-@ kick before Craig Beattie scored and then set up Rudolf Skácel to put Hearts in front . Zaliukas then scored a late own goal after deflecting a Nigel Hasselbaink shot into his own net to level the match . In the replay at St Mirren Park , Carey had an early penalty saved , after a handball by Zaliukas , and Hasselbaink then scored a goal which was ruled out because the referee had not given St Mirren an advantage . Hearts then came back into the match as Hamill and Skácel scored to give Hearts a 2 @-@ 0 win . In the semi @-@ final at Hampden Park , Hearts were drawn against cup holders Celtic . Skácel scored shortly after half @-@ time for Hearts before Gary Hooper scored a late equaliser for Celtic . Hearts were then awarded a stoppage @-@ time penalty which former Celtic striker Beattie converted . There was controversy around both Hooper 's goal and Beattie 's penalty after the match as Hooper had looked offside when he scored his goal and Hearts ' penalty was considered to have been wrongly awarded by the referee .

 This was Hibs 12th appearance in the Scottish Cup Final . They had previously won two Scottish Cups ( in 1887 and 1902 ) , and been beaten in nine finals ( in 1896 , 1914 , 1923 , 1924 , 1947 , 1958 , 1972 , 1979 and 2001 ) . Hearts were appearing in their 14th Scottish Cup Final . They had won seven Scottish Cups ( in 1891 , 1896 , 1901 , 1906 , 1956 , 1998 and 2006 ) and been beaten in the final six times ( in 1903 , 1907 , 1968 , 1976 , 1986 and 1996 ) . The only previous meeting of the two clubs in a Scottish Cup Final was in 1896 , when the match was played at New Logie Green ( home of St Bernard 's ) in Edinburgh . 
 With two clubs from Edinburgh qualifying for the final , some City of Edinburgh Council members called for the match to be played at Murrayfield Stadium instead of Hampden Park , the traditional venue for Scottish Cup Finals . A survey by the Edinburgh Evening News found that 37 of 58 councillors favoured Murrayfield , with nine favouring Hampden . Supporters of moving the game to Murrayfield cited its greater capacity , convenience for the majority of fans and the precedent of the 1896 Scottish Cup Final . The Scottish Football Association stated that no venue other than Hampden would be considered . Supporters of keeping the game at Hampden cited that the players would prefer to play at the national football stadium and that some fans had already begun to make arrangements for the tie being in Glasgow . First ScotRail provided additional capacity on their routes between Edinburgh and Glasgow . 
 Both clubs received an allocation of approximately 20 @,@ 000 tickets , out of a total capacity of 52 @,@ 063 . The remaining seats are accounted for by Hampden Park debenture holders , hospitality , sponsors , media and segregation areas . In excess of 1 @,@ 000 unused debentures were distributed to each club . The allocation was enough to provide for the season ticket holders of each club , with Hearts having 10 @,@ 000 and Hibs 7 @,@ 500 approximately , although both clubs anticipated that there would be little or no need for a general public sale . Hearts decided to sell tickets using their loyalty points system , while Hibs connected their allocation to sales of season tickets and memberships . Due to high demand , Hearts tightened the criteria needed for a ticket during the sales process . Regular tickets cost £ 35 or £ 28 for adults and £ 10 for children under 15 years old .

 Hibs suffered an injury during the semi @-@ final , when their regular goalkeeper Graham Stack had to be substituted due to a thigh injury . A scan following the match showed that he would be unable to play for between 10 and 12 weeks , and therefore would miss the final . Hibs secured their place in the Scottish Premier League with one game to spare and rested several players for the final game of their league programme . Defender Matt Doherty suffered a foot injury in that league game , but manager Pat Fenlon said he was confident Doherty would be able to play in the final . Fenlon then took his squad to his home town of Dublin to prepare for the cup final and told the media that he had almost finalised his team selection . 
 Having finished in the top half of the 2011 – 12 Scottish Premier League , Hearts were involved in the battle to qualify for the 2012 – 13 UEFA Europa League competition . A victory against St Johnstone in their penultimate league match lifted Hearts into fifth place , a qualifying position . Hearts then rested some players for their final league match , a 5 – 0 defeat by Celtic . Entering the week before the cup final , Hearts had concerns about the fitness of striker Craig Beattie , who was unable to train due to a hamstring injury . 
 Craig Thomson was appointed to referee the match . Thomson decided to donate his match fee of £ 1 @,@ 000 to a hospice in Paisley , where his late mother had been treated .

 Hearts started the match as the brighter of the two teams . Rudolf Skácel headed wide early on from an Andrew Driver cross . Hearts took the lead through Darren Barr in the 15th minute , scoring from close range . Hearts continued to control the match and Pa Kujabi picked up a booking for fouling Suso Santana . Skácel then doubled Hearts ' lead after receiving the ball on the edge of the area and turning to hit a shot which deflected off James McPake before going in . Hibs then had an opportunity as Kujabi 's cross came to Garry O 'Connor , but he hit his shot over the bar . McPake then made a goal @-@ line clearance from a Suso shot which had beaten Hibs ' keeper Mark Brown . McPake got Hibs back into the game from a corner . Tom Soares ' initial delivery was cleared but he got the ball back out on the wing and put in a low cross which McPake converted . 
 Almost immediately after the start of the second @-@ half Hearts were awarded a penalty kick . Kujabi fouled Suso by pulling his jersey and catching his heel , but television replays showed that the foul had taken place outside the penalty area . Hibs were also reduced to ten men as Kujabi received his second yellow card , resulting in a red . Danny Grainger converted the penalty , which was also his first goal for Hearts . Soon afterwards , Ryan McGowan scored with a header after Hibs keeper Brown had initially saved from Stephen Elliott . Skácel finished the scoring with another shot from just outside the box to make it 5 @-@ 1 for Hearts .

 = Battle of Valcour Island = 
 The naval Battle of Valcour Island , also known as the Battle of Valcour Bay , took place on October 11 , 1776 , on Lake Champlain . The main action took place in Valcour Bay , a narrow strait between the New York mainland and Valcour Island . The battle is generally regarded as one of the first naval battles of the American Revolutionary War , and one of the first fought by the United States Navy . Most of the ships in the American fleet under the command of Benedict Arnold were captured or destroyed by a British force under the overall direction of General Guy Carleton . However , the American defense of Lake Champlain stalled British plans to reach the upper Hudson River valley . 
 The Continental Army had retreated from Quebec to Fort Ticonderoga and Fort Crown Point in June 1776 after British forces were massively reinforced . They spent the summer of 1776 fortifying those forts , and building additional ships to augment the small American fleet already on the lake . General Carleton had a 9 @,@ 000 man army at Fort Saint @-@ Jean , but needed to build a fleet to carry it on the lake . The Americans , during their retreat , had either taken or destroyed most of the ships on the lake . By early October , the British fleet , which significantly outgunned the American fleet , was ready for launch . 
 On October 11 , Arnold drew the British fleet to a position he had carefully chosen to limit their advantages . In the battle that followed , many of the American ships were damaged or destroyed . That night , Arnold sneaked the American fleet past the British one , beginning a retreat toward Crown Point and Ticonderoga . Unfavorable weather hampered the American retreat , and more of the fleet was either captured or grounded and burned before it could reach Crown Point . Upon reaching Crown Point Arnold had the fort 's buildings burned and retreated to Ticonderoga . 
 The British fleet included four officers who later became admirals in the Royal Navy : Thomas Pringle , James Dacres , Edward Pellew and John Schank . Valcour Bay , the site of the battle , is now a National Historic Landmark , as is USS Philadelphia , which sank shortly after the October 11 battle , and was raised in 1935 . The underwater site of USS Spitfire , located in 1997 , is on the National Register of Historic Places . 
 = = Background = = 
 The American Revolutionary War , which began in April 1775 with the Battles of Lexington and Concord , widened in September 1775 when the Continental Army embarked on an invasion of the British Province of Quebec . The province was viewed by the Second Continental Congress as a potential avenue for British forces to attack and divide the rebellious colonies , and was at the time lightly defended . The invasion reached a peak on December 31 , 1775 , when the Battle of Quebec ended in disaster for the Americans . In the spring of 1776 , 10 @,@ 000 British and German troops arrived in Quebec , and General Guy Carleton , the provincial governor , drove the Continental Army out of Quebec and back to Fort Ticonderoga . 
 Carleton then launched his own offensive intended to reach the Hudson River , whose navigable length begins south of Lake Champlain and extends down to New York City . Control of the upper Hudson would enable the British to link their forces in Quebec with those in New York , recently captured in the New York campaign by Major General William Howe . This strategy would separate the American colonies of New England from those farther south and potentially quash the rebellion . Lake Champlain , a long and relatively narrow lake formed by the action of glaciers during the last ice age , separates the Green Mountains of Vermont from the Adirondack Mountains of New York . Its 120 @-@ mile ( 190 km ) length and 12 @-@ mile ( 19 km ) maximum width creates more than 550 miles ( 890 km ) of shoreline , with many bays , inlets and promontories . More than 70 islands dot the 435 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 130 km2 ) surface , although during periods of low and high water , these numbers can change . The lake is relatively shallow , with an average depth of 64 feet ( 20 m ) . Running roughly from south to north , the lake 's waters empty into the Richelieu River , where waterfalls at Saint @-@ Jean in Quebec mark the northernmost point of navigation . 
 The American strongholds of Fort Crown Point and Fort Ticonderoga near the lake 's southern end protected access to uppermost navigable reaches of the Hudson River . Elimination of these defenses required the transportation of troops and supplies from the British @-@ controlled St. Lawrence Valley 90 miles ( 150 km ) to the north . Roads were either impassable or nonexistent , making water transport on the lake the only viable option . The only ships on the lake following the American retreat from Quebec were a small fleet of lightly armed ships that Benedict Arnold had assembled following the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775 . This fleet , even if it had been in British hands , was too small to transport the large British Army to Fort Ticonderoga . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 During their retreat from Quebec , the Americans carefully took or destroyed all ships on Lake Champlain that might prove useful to the British . When Arnold and his troops , making up the rear guard of the army , abandoned Fort Saint @-@ Jean , they burned or sank all the boats they could not use , and set fire to the sawmill and the fort . These actions effectively denied the British any hope of immediately moving onto the lake . 
 The two sides set about building fleets : the British at Saint @-@ Jean and the Americans at the other end of the lake in Skenesborough ( present @-@ day Whitehall , New York ) . While planning Quebec 's defenses in 1775 , General Carleton had anticipated the problem of transportation on Lake Champlain , and had requested the provisioning of prefabricated ships from Europe . By the time Carleton 's army reached Saint @-@ Jean , ten such ships had arrived . These ships and more were assembled by skilled shipwrights on the upper Richelieu River . Also assembled there was HMS Inflexible , a 180 @-@ ton warship they disassembled at Quebec City and transported upriver in pieces . In total , the British fleet ( 25 armed vessels ) had more firepower than the Americans ' 15 vessels , with more than 80 guns outweighing the 74 smaller American guns . Two of Carleton 's ships , Inflexible ( 18 12 @-@ pounders ) and HMS Thunderer ( six 24 @-@ pound guns , six 12 @-@ pound guns , and two howitzers ) , by themselves outgunned the combined firepower of the American fleet . In addition to Inflexible and Thunderer , the fleet included the schooners Maria ( 14 guns ) , Carleton ( 12 guns ) , and Loyal Convert ( 6 guns ) , and 20 single @-@ masted gunboats each armed with two cannons . 
 The American generals leading their shipbuilding effort encountered a variety of challenges . Shipwright was not a common occupation in the relative wilderness of upstate New York , and the Continental Navy had to pay extremely high wages to lure skilled craftsmen away from the coast . The carpenters hired to build boats on Lake Champlain were the best @-@ paid employees of the navy , excepting only the Navy 's Commodore , Esek Hopkins . By the end of July there were more than 200 shipwrights at Skenesborough . In addition to skilled help , materials and supplies specific to maritime use needed to be brought to Skenesborough , where the ships were constructed , or Fort Ticonderoga , where they were fitted out for use . 
 The shipbuilding at Skenesborough was overseen by Hermanus Schuyler ( possibly a relation of Major General Philip Schuyler ) , and the outfitting was managed by military engineer <unk> Baldwin . Schuyler began work in April to produce boats larger and more suitable for combat than the small shallow @-@ draft boats known as bateaux that were used for transport on the lake . The process eventually came to involve General Arnold , who was an experienced ship 's captain , and David Waterbury , a Connecticut militia leader with maritime experience . Major General Horatio Gates , in charge of the entire shipbuilding effort , eventually asked Arnold to take more responsibility in the effort , because " I am intirely uninform 'd as to Marine Affairs . " 
 Arnold took up the task with relish , and Gates rewarded him with command of the fleet , writing that " [ Arnold ] has a perfect knowledge in maritime affairs , and is , besides , a most gallant and deserving officer . " Arnold 's appointment was not without trouble ; Jacobus <unk> , who had been in command of the fleet , refused to accept that Gates had authority over him , and had to be arrested . The shipbuilding was significantly slowed in mid @-@ August by an outbreak of disease among the shipwrights . Although the army leadership had been scrupulous about keeping smallpox sufferers segregated from others , the disease that slowed the shipbuilding for several weeks was some kind of fever . 
 While both sides busied themselves with shipbuilding , the growing American fleet patrolled the waters of Lake Champlain . At one point in August , Arnold sailed part of the fleet to the northernmost end of the lake , within 20 miles ( 32 km ) of Saint @-@ Jean , and formed a battle line . A British outpost , well out of range , fired a few shots at the line without effect . On September 30 , expecting the British to sail soon , Arnold retreated to the shelter of Valcour Island . During his patrols of the lake Arnold had commanded the fleet from the schooner Royal Savage , carrying 12 guns and captained by David Hawley . When it came time for the battle , Arnold transferred his flag to Congress , a row galley . Other ships in the fleet included Revenge and Liberty , also two @-@ masted schooners carrying 8 guns , as well as Enterprise , a sloop ( 12 guns ) , and 8 gundalows outfitted as gunboats ( each with three guns ) : New Haven , Providence , Boston , Spitfire , Philadelphia , Connecticut , Jersey , New York , the cutter Lee , and the row galleys Trumbull and Washington . Liberty was not present at the battle , having been sent to Ticonderoga for provisions . 
 Arnold , whose business activities before the war had included sailing ships to Europe and the West Indies , carefully chose the site where he wanted to meet the British fleet . Reliable intelligence he received on October 1 indicated that the British had a force significantly more powerful than his . Because his force was inferior , he chose the narrow , rocky body of water between the western shore of Lake Champlain and Valcour Island ( near modern Plattsburgh , New York ) , where the British fleet would have difficulty bringing its superior firepower to bear , and where the inferior seamanship of his relatively unskilled sailors would have a minimal negative effect . Some of Arnold 's captains wanted to fight in open waters where they might be able to retreat to the shelter of Fort Crown Point , but Arnold argued that the primary purpose of the fleet was not survival but the delay of a British advance on Crown Point and Ticonderoga until the following spring . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Carleton 's fleet , commanded by Captain Thomas Pringle and including 50 unarmed support vessels , sailed onto Lake Champlain on October 9 . They cautiously advanced southward , searching for signs of Arnold 's fleet . On the night of October 10 , the fleet anchored about 15 miles ( 24 km ) to the north of Arnold 's position , still unaware of his location . The next day , they continued to sail south , assisted by favorable winds . After they passed the northern tip of Valcour Island , Arnold sent out Congress and Royal Savage to draw the attention of the British . Following an inconsequential exchange of fire with the British , the two ships tried to return to Arnold 's crescent @-@ shaped firing line . However , Royal Savage was unable to fight the headwinds , and ran aground on the southern tip of Valcour Island . Some of the British gunboats swarmed toward her , as Captain Hawley and his men hastily abandoned ship . Men from the HMS Loyal Convert boarded her , capturing 20 men in the process , but were then forced to abandon her under heavy fire from the Americans . Many of Arnold 's papers were lost with the destruction of Royal Savage , which was burned by the British . 
 The British gunboats and Carleton then maneuvered within range of the American line . Thunderer and HMS Maria were unable to make headway against the winds , and did not participate in the battle , while Inflexible eventually came far enough up the strait to participate in the action . Around 12 : 30 pm , the battle began in earnest , with both sides firing broadsides and cannonades at each other , and continued all afternoon . Revenge was heavily hit ; Philadelphia was also heavily damaged and eventually sank around 6 : 30 pm . Carleton , whose guns wrought havoc against the smaller American gundalows , became a focus of attention . A lucky shot eventually snapped the line holding her broadside in position , and she was seriously damaged before she could be towed out of range of the American line . Her casualties were significant ; eight men were killed and another eight wounded . The young Edward Pellew , serving as a midshipman aboard Carleton , distinguished himself by ably commanding the vessel to safety when its senior officers , including its captain , Lieutenant James Dacres , were injured . Another lucky American shot hit a British gunboat 's magazine and the vessel exploded . 
 Toward sunset , Inflexible finally reached the action . Her big guns quickly silenced most of Arnold 's fleet . The British also began landing Indians on both Valcour Island and the lakeshore , in order to deny the Americans the possibility of retreating to land . As darkness fell , the American fleet retreated , and the British called off the attack , in part because some boats had run out of ammunition . Lieutenant James Hadden , commanding one of the British gunboats , noted that " little more than one third of the British Fleet " saw much action that day . 
 = = Retreat = = 
 When the sun set on October 11 , the battle had clearly gone against the Americans . Most of the American ships were damaged or sinking , and the crews reported around 60 casualties . The British reported around 40 casualties on their ships . Aware that he could not defeat the British fleet , Arnold decided to try reaching the cover of Fort Crown Point , about 35 miles ( 56 km ) to the south . Under the cover of a dark and foggy night , the fleet , with muffled oars and minimal illumination , threaded its way through a gap about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) wide between the British ships and the western shore , where Indian campfires burned . By morning , they had reached Schuyler Island , about 8 miles ( 13 km ) up the lake . Carleton , upset that the Americans had escaped him , immediately sent his fleet around Valcour Island to find them . Realizing the Americans were not there , he regrouped his fleet and sent scouts to find Arnold . 
 Adverse winds as well as damaged and leaky boats slowed the American fleet 's progress . At Schuyler Island , Providence and Jersey were sunk or burned , and crude repairs were effected to other vessels . The cutter Lee was also abandoned on the western shore and eventually taken by the British . Around 2 : 00 pm , the fleet sailed again , trying to make headway against biting winds , rain , and sleet . By the following morning , the ships were still more than 20 miles ( 32 km ) from Crown Point , and the British fleet 's masts were visible on the horizon . When the wind finally changed , the British had its advantage first . They closed once again , opening fire on Congress and Washington , which were in the rear of the American fleet . Arnold first decided to attempt grounding the slower gunboats at Split Rock , 18 miles ( 29 km ) short of Crown Point . Washington , however , was too badly damaged and too slow to make it , and she was forced to strike her colors and surrender ; 110 men were taken prisoner . 
 Arnold then led many of the remaining smaller craft into a small bay on the Vermont shore now named Arnold 's Bay 2 miles south of <unk> Bay , where the waters were too shallow for the larger British vessels to follow . These boats were then run aground , stripped , and set on fire , with their flags still flying . Arnold , the last to land , personally torched his flagship Congress . The surviving ships ' crews , numbering about 200 , then made their way overland to Crown Point , narrowly escaping an Indian ambush . There they found Trumbull , New York , Enterprise , and Revenge , all of which had escaped the British fleet , as well as Liberty , which had just arrived with supplies from Ticonderoga . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Arnold , convinced that Crown Point was no longer viable as a point of defense against the large British force , destroyed and abandoned the fort , moving the forces stationed there to Ticonderoga . General Carleton , rather than shipping his prisoners back to Quebec , returned them to Ticonderoga under a flag of truce . On their arrival , the released men were so effusive in their praise of Carleton that they were sent home to prevent the desertion of other troops . 
 With control of the lake , the British landed troops and occupied Crown Point the next day . They remained for two weeks , pushing scouting parties to within three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) of Ticonderoga . The battle @-@ season was getting late as the first snow began to fall on October 20 and his supply line would be difficult to manage in winter , so Carleton decided to withdraw north to winter quarters ; Arnold 's plan of delay had succeeded . Baron Riedesel , commanding the Hessians in Carleton 's army , noted that , " If we could have begun our expedition four weeks earlier , I am satisfied that everything could have ended this year . " 
 The 1777 British campaign , led by General John Burgoyne , was halted by Continental forces , some led with vigor by General Arnold , in the Battles of Saratoga . Burgoyne 's subsequent surrender paved the way for the entry of France into the war as an American ally . 
 The captains of Maria , Inflexible , and Loyal Convert wrote a letter criticizing Captain Pringle for making Arnold 's escape possible by failing to properly blockade the channel , and for not being more aggressive in directing the battle . Apparently the letter did not cause any career problems for Pringle or its authors ; he and John Schank , captain of the Inflexible , became admirals , as did midshipman Pellew and Lieutenant Dacres . Carleton was awarded the Order of the Bath by King George III for his success at Valcour Island . On December 31 , 1776 one year after the Battle of Quebec , a mass was held in celebration of the British success , and Carleton threw a grand ball . 
 The loss of Benedict Arnold 's papers aboard Royal Savage was to have important consequences later in his career . For a variety of reasons , Congress ordered an inquiry into his conduct of the Quebec campaign , which included a detailed look at his claims for compensation . The inquiry took place in late 1779 , when Arnold was in military command of Philadelphia and recuperating from serious wounds received at Saratoga . Congress found that he owed it money since he could not produce receipts for expenses he claimed to have paid from his own funds . Although Arnold had already been secretly negotiating with the British over a change of allegiance since May 1779 , this news contributed to his decision to resign the command of Philadelphia . His next command was West Point , which he sought with the intention of facilitating its surrender to the British . His plot was however exposed in September 1780 , at which time he fled to the British in New York City . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 In the 1930s , Lorenzo Hagglund , a veteran of World War I and a history buff , began searching the strait for remains of the battle . In 1932 he found the remains of Royal Savage 's hull , which he successfully raised in 1934 . Stored for more than fifty years , the remains were sold by his son to the National Civil War Museum . As of March 2009 , the remains were in a city garage in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania . The city of Plattsburgh , New York , has claimed ownership of the remains and would like them returned to upstate New York . 
 In 1935 Hagglund followed up his discovery of Royal Savage with the discovery of Philadelphia 's remains , sitting upright on the lake bottom . He raised her that year ; she is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , D.C. , and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is designated a National Historic Landmark . The site of the battle , Valcour Bay , was declared a National Historic Landmark on January 1 , 1961 , and added to the National Register on October 15 , 1966 . 
 In 1997 another pristine underwater wreck was located during a survey by the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum . Two years later it was conclusively identified as the gundalow Spitfire ; this site was listed on the National Register in 2008 , and it has been named as part of the U.S. government 's Save America 's Treasures program .

 = USS New Jersey ( BB @-@ 62 ) = 
 USS New Jersey ( BB @-@ 62 ; " Big J " or " Black Dragon " ) is an Iowa @-@ class battleship , and was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of the US state of New Jersey . New Jersey earned more battle stars for combat actions than the other three completed Iowa @-@ class battleships , and was the only US battleship providing gunfire support during the Vietnam War . 
 During World War II , New Jersey shelled targets on Guam and Okinawa , and screened aircraft carriers conducting raids in the Marshall Islands . During the Korean War , she was involved in raids up and down the North Korean coast , after which she was decommissioned into the United States Navy reserve fleets , better known as the " mothball fleet " . She was briefly reactivated in 1968 and sent to Vietnam to support US troops before returning to the mothball fleet in 1969 . Reactivated once more in the 1980s as part of the 600 @-@ ship Navy program , New Jersey was modernized to carry missiles and recommissioned for service . In 1983 , she participated in US operations during the Lebanese Civil War . 
 New Jersey was decommissioned for the last time in 1991 ( after serving a total of 21 years in the active fleet ) , having earned a Navy Unit Commendation for service in Vietnam and 19 battle and campaign stars for combat operations during World War II , the Korean War , the Vietnam War , the Lebanese Civil War , and service in the Persian Gulf . After a brief retention in the mothball fleet , she was donated to the Home Port Alliance in Camden , New Jersey , and began her career as a museum ship 15 October 2001 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 New Jersey was one of the Iowa @-@ class " fast battleship " designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the Bureau of Construction and Repair . She was launched on 12 December 1942 and commissioned on 23 May 1943 . The ship was the second of the Iowa class to be commissioned by the U.S. Navy . The ship was christened at her launching by Carolyn Edison , wife of Governor Charles Edison of New Jersey , himself a former Secretary of the Navy ; and commissioned at Philadelphia 23 May 1943 , Captain Carl F. Holden in command . 
 New Jersey 's main battery consisted of nine 16 " / 50 caliber Mark 7 guns in three three @-@ gun turrets , which could fire 2 @,@ 700 @-@ pound ( 1 @,@ 225 kg ) armor @-@ piercing shells some 23 miles ( 37 km ) . Her secondary battery consisted of twenty 5 " / 38 caliber guns mounted in twin @-@ gun dual purpose ( DP ) turrets , which could hit targets up to 9 miles ( 14 km ) away . With the advent of air power and the need to gain and maintain air superiority came a need to protect the growing fleet of allied aircraft carriers , so New Jersey was fitted with an array of Oerlikon 20 mm and Bofors 40 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns . When reactivated in 1968 , New Jersey had her 20 mm and 40 mm AA guns removed and was tailored for use as a heavy bombardment ship . When reactivated in 1982 , New Jersey had four twin 5 " / 38 caliber DP mounts removed . She was outfitted with four Phalanx CIWS mounts for protection against missiles and aircraft , and eight Armored Box Launchers and eight Quad Cell Launchers designed to fire Tomahawk missiles and Harpoon missiles , respectively . 
 Unlike the other Iowa @-@ class battleships , New Jersey was named by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to repay a political debt , to then @-@ New Jersey Governor Charles Edison . During his time in the Navy department , Edison pushed to build the Iowas , and to build one at the Philadelphia Navy Yard , which secured votes for Roosevelt in Pennsylvania and New Jersey in the 1940 presidential election .

 = = = Shakedown and service with the 5th Fleet , Admiral Spruance = = = 
 New Jersey completed fitting out and trained her initial crew in the Western Atlantic and Caribbean Sea . On 7 January 1944 she passed through the Panama Canal war @-@ bound for Funafuti , Ellice Islands . She reported there 22 January for duty with the United States Fifth Fleet , and three days later rendezvoused with Task Group 58 @.@ 2 for the assault on the Marshall Islands . New Jersey screened the aircraft carriers from Japanese attack as planes from Task Group 58 @.@ 2 flew strikes against Kwajalein and Eniwetok 29 January – 2 February , softening up the latter for its invasion and supporting the troops who landed on 31 January . 
 New Jersey began her career as a flagship 4 February in Majuro Lagoon when Admiral Raymond A. Spruance , commanding the 5th Fleet , broke his flag from her main . Her first action as a flagship was in Operation Hailstone , a two @-@ day surface and air strike by her task force against the major Japanese fleet base on Truk in the Carolines . This attack was coordinated with the assault on Kwajalein , and effectively interdicted the Japanese naval retaliation to the conquest of the Marshalls . On 17 and 18 February , the task force accounted for two Japanese light cruisers , four destroyers , three auxiliary cruisers , two submarine tenders , two submarine chasers , an armed trawler , a plane ferry , and 23 other auxiliaries , not including small craft . New Jersey destroyed a trawler and , with other ships , sank the destroyer Maikaze . New Jersey also fired on an enemy aircraft that attacked her formation . The task force returned to the Marshalls 19 February . 
 Between 17 March and 10 April , New Jersey first sailed with Rear Admiral Marc A. Mitscher 's flagship Lexington for an air and surface bombardment of Mille , then rejoined Task Group 58 @.@ 2 for a strike against shipping in the Palaus , and bombarded Woleai . Upon his return to Majuro , Admiral Spruance transferred his flag to Indianapolis . 
 New Jersey 's next war cruise , 13 April – 4 May 1944 , began and ended at Majuro . She screened the carrier striking force which gave air support to the invasion of Aitape , Tanahmerah Bay and Humboldt Bay , New Guinea , 22 April , then shelled shipping and shore installations at Truk 29 April – 30 April . New Jersey and her formation shot down two enemy torpedo bombers at Truk . Her 16 inch salvos pounded Ponape 1 May , destroying fuel tanks , badly damaging the airfield , and demolishing a headquarters building . 
 After rehearsing in the Marshalls for the invasion of the Marianas , New Jersey put to sea 6 June in the screening and bombardment group of Admiral Mitscher 's Task Force . On the second day of preinvasion air strikes , 12 June , New Jersey shot down an enemy torpedo bomber , and during the next two days her heavy guns battered Saipan and Tinian , in advance of the marine landings on 15 June . 
 The Japanese response to the Marianas operation was an order to its main surface fleet to attack and annihilate the American invasion force . <unk> American submarines tracked the Japanese fleet into the Philippine Sea as Admiral Spruance joined his task force with Admiral Mitscher 's to meet the enemy . New Jersey took station in the protective screen around the carriers on 19 June 1944 as American and Japanese pilots dueled in the Battle of the Philippine Sea . That day and the next would cripple Japanese naval aviation ; in what would become known as the " Marianas Turkey Shoot " , the Japanese lost some 400 planes for less than two dozen American aircraft in return . This loss of trained pilots and aircraft was equaled in disaster by the sinking of the Japanese aircraft carriers Taihō and Shōkaku by the submarines Albacore and Cavalla , respectively , and the loss of Hiyō to aircraft launched from the light aircraft carrier Belleau Wood . In addition to these losses , Allied forces succeeded in damaging two Japanese carriers and a battleship . The anti @-@ aircraft fire of New Jersey and the other screening ships proved virtually impenetrable ; two American ships were slightly damaged during the battle . Only 17 American planes were lost in combat . 
 = = = Service with the 3rd Fleet , Admiral Halsey = = = 
 New Jersey 's final contribution to the conquest of the Marianas was in strikes on Guam and the Palaus from which she sailed for Pearl Harbor , arriving 9 August . Here she broke the flag of Admiral William F. Halsey , Jr . , 24 August , becoming flagship of the United States Third Fleet . On 30 August New Jersey set sail from Pearl Harbor , and for the next eight months was based at Ulithi to lend support to Allied forces operating in the Philippines . In this span of the Pacific War , fast carrier task forces ranged the waters off the Philippines , Okinawa , and Formosa , making repeated strikes at airfields , shipping , shore bases , and invasion beaches . 
 In September the targets were in the Visayas and the southern Philippines , then Manila and Cavite , Panay , Negros , Leyte , and Cebu . Early in October raids to destroy enemy air power based on Okinawa and Formosa were begun in preparation for the Leyte landings of 20 October 1944 . 
 This invasion brought on the last great sortie of the Imperial Japanese Navy . Its plan for the Battle of Leyte Gulf included a feint by a northern force of <unk> heavy attack carriers to draw away the battleships , cruisers and fast carriers with which Admiral Halsey was protecting the landings . This was to allow the Japanese Center Force to enter the gulf through San Bernardino Strait . At the opening of the battle planes from the carriers guarded by New Jersey struck hard at both the Japanese Southern and Center Forces , sinking a battleship 23 October . The next day Halsey shaped his course north after the decoy force had been spotted . Planes from his carriers sank four of the Japanese carriers , as well as a destroyer and a cruiser , while New Jersey steamed south at flank speed to meet the newly developed threat of the Center force . It had been turned back in a stunning defeat when she arrived . 
 New Jersey rejoined her fast carriers near San Bernardino 27 October 1944 for strikes on central and southern Luzon . Two days later , the force came under suicide attack . In a melee of anti @-@ aircraft fire from the ships and combat air patrol , New Jersey shot down a plane whose pilot maneuvered it into the port gun galleries of Intrepid , while machine gun fire from Intrepid wounded three of New Jersey 's men . During a similar action 25 November three Japanese planes were shot down by the combined fire of the force , part of one flaming onto the flight deck of Hancock . Intrepid was again attacked ; she shot down one would @-@ be kamikaze aircraft , but was crashed by another despite hits scored on the attacker by New Jersey gunners . New Jersey shot down a plane diving on Cabot and hit another plane which smashed into Cabot 's port bow . 
 On 18 December 1944 the ships of Task Force 38 unexpectedly found themselves in a fight for their lives when Typhoon Cobra overtook the force — seven fleet and six light carriers , eight battleships , 15 cruisers , and about 50 destroyers — during their attempt to refuel at sea . At the time the ships were operating about 300 miles ( 500 km ) east of Luzon in the Philippine Sea . The carriers had just completed three days of heavy raids against Japanese airfields , suppressing enemy aircraft during the American amphibious operations against Mindoro in the Philippines . The task force rendezvoused with Captain Jasper T. Acuff and his fueling group 17 December with the intention of refueling all ships in the task force and replacing lost aircraft . 
 Although the sea had been growing rougher all day , the nearby cyclonic disturbance gave relatively little warning of its approach . Each of the carriers in the Third Fleet had a weatherman aboard , and as the fleet flagship New Jersey had a highly experienced weatherman : Commander G. F. <unk> , a graduate of the <unk> course at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who had also studied hurricanes in the West Indies ; despite this , none of these individuals or staffs were able to give Third Fleet due warning of the impending typhoon . On 18 December , the small but violent typhoon overtook the Task Force while many of the ships were attempting to refuel . Many of the ships were caught near the center of the storm and buffeted by extreme seas and hurricane @-@ force winds . Three destroyers — Hull , Monaghan and Spence — capsized and sank with nearly all hands , while a cruiser , five aircraft carriers , and three destroyers suffered serious damage . Approximately 790 officers and men were lost or killed , with another 80 injured . Fires occurred in three carriers when planes broke loose in their hangars , and some 146 planes on various ships were lost or damaged beyond economical repair by fires , impact damage , or by being swept overboard . As with the other battleships of TF 38 , skillful seamanship brought New Jersey through the storm largely unscathed . She returned to Ulithi on Christmas Eve to be met by Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz . 
 = = = Service with Battleship Division Seven , Admiral Badger = = = 
 New Jersey ranged far and wide from 30 December 1944 to 25 January 1945 on her last cruise as Admiral Halsey 's flagship . She guarded the carriers in their strikes on Formosa , Okinawa , and Luzon , on the coast of Indo @-@ China , Hong Kong , Swatow and Amoy , and again on Formosa and Okinawa . At Ulithi 27 January Admiral Halsey lowered his flag in New Jersey , but it was replaced two days later by that of Rear Admiral Oscar C. Badger II commanding Battleship Division 7 . 
 In support of the assault on Iwo Jima , New Jersey screened the Essex group in air attacks on the island 19 February – 21 February , and gave the same crucial service for the first major carrier raid on Tokyo 25 February , a raid aimed specifically at aircraft production . During the next two days , Okinawa was attacked from the air by the same striking force . 
 New Jersey was directly engaged in the conquest of Okinawa from 14 March until 16 April . As the carriers prepared for the invasion with strikes there and on Honshū , New Jersey fought off air raids , used her seaplanes to rescue downed pilots , defended the carriers from suicide planes , shooting down at least three and assisting in the destruction of others . On 24 March 1945 she again carried out the role of heavy bombardment , preparing the invasion beaches for the assault a week later . 
 During the final months of the war , New Jersey was overhauled at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard , from which she sailed 4 July for San Pedro , Pearl Harbor , and Eniwetok bound for Guam . Here on 14 August she once again became flagship of the 5th Fleet under Admiral Spruance . Brief stays at Manila and Okinawa preceded her arrival in Tokyo Bay 17 September , where she served as flagship for the successive commanders of Naval Forces in Japanese waters until relieved 28 January 1946 by Iowa ( BB @-@ 61 ) . As part of the ongoing Operation Magic Carpet New Jersey took aboard nearly a thousand homeward @-@ bound troops with whom she arrived at San Francisco 10 February . 
 = = Post World War II ( 1946 – 1950 ) = = 
 After west coast operations and a normal overhaul at Puget Sound , New Jersey 's keel once more cut the Atlantic as she came home to Bayonne , New Jersey , for a rousing fourth birthday party 23 May 1947 . Present were Governor Alfred E. Driscoll , former Governor Walter E. Edge and other dignitaries . 
 Between 7 June and 26 August , New Jersey formed part of the first training squadron to cruise Northern European waters since the beginning of World War II . Over two thousand United States Naval Academy and NROTC midshipmen received seagoing experience under the command of Admiral Richard L. Connolly , Commander Naval Forces Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean , who broke his flag in New Jersey at Rosyth , Scotland 23 June . She was the scene of official receptions at Oslo , where King Haakon VII of Norway inspected the crew 2 July , and at Portsmouth , England . The training fleet was westward bound 18 July for exercises in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic . 
 After serving at New York as flagship for Rear Admiral Heber H. McLean , Commander , Battleship Division 1 , 12 September – 18 October , New Jersey was inactivated at the New York Naval Shipyard . She was decommissioned at Bayonne 30 June 1948 and assigned to the New York Group , Atlantic Reserve Fleet . 
 = = The Korean War ( 1950 – 1953 ) = = 
 In 1950 North Korea invaded South Korea , prompting the United States to intervene in the name of the United Nations . President Harry S. Truman was caught off guard when the invasion struck , but quickly ordered U.S. Forces stationed in Japan into South Korea . Truman also sent U.S. based troops , tanks , fighter and bomber aircraft , and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea . As part of the naval mobilization New Jersey was recalled from the mothball fleet to provide seaborne artillery support for U.N. and South Korean troops . New Jersey was recommissioned at Bayonne on 21 November 1950 , Captain David M. Tyree in command , and proceeded to the Caribbean , where she welded her crew into an efficient body which would meet the demanding requirements of the Korean War . She sailed from Norfolk , Virginia 16 April 1951 and arrived from Japan off the east coast of Korea 17 May . Vice Admiral Harold M. Martin , commanding the United States Seventh Fleet , placed his flag in New Jersey for the next six months . 
 New Jersey 's guns opened the first shore bombardment of her Korean career at Wonsan 20 May . During her two tours of duty in Korean waters , she was again and again to play the part of seaborne mobile artillery . In direct support to United Nations troops ; or in preparation for ground actions , in interdicting Communist supply and communication routes , or in destroying supplies and troop positions , New Jersey used her 16 inch guns to fire far beyond the capacity of land artillery , moved rapidly and free from major attack from one target to another , and at the same time could be immediately available to guard aircraft carriers should they require her protection . It was on this first such mission at Wonsan that she received her only combat casualties of the Korean War . One of her men was killed and two severely wounded when she took a hit from a shore battery on her number one turret and received a near miss aft to port . 
 Between 23 and 27 May and again 30 May 1951 , New Jersey pounded targets near Yangyang and Kansong , dispersing troop concentrations , dropping a bridge span , and destroying three large ammunition dumps . Air spotters reported Yangyang abandoned at the end of this action , while railroad facilities and vehicles were smashed at Kansong . On 24 May , she lost one of her helicopters after the crew pushed their chopper to the limit of its fuel searching for a downed aviator . The helicopter crew was able to reach friendly territory and were later returned to their ship . 
 With Admiral Arthur W. Radford , Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet , and Vice Admiral C. Turner Joy , Commander Naval Forces Far East aboard , New Jersey bombarded targets at Wonsan 4 June . At Kansong two days later she fired her main battery at an artillery regiment and truck encampment , with 7th Fleet aircraft spotting targets and reporting successes . On 28 July off Wonsan the battleship was again taken under fire by shore batteries . Several near misses splashed to port , but New Jersey 's precision fire silenced the enemy and destroyed several gun emplacements . 
 Between 4 and 12 July , New Jersey supported a United Nations push in the Kansong area , firing at enemy buildup and reorganization positions . As the Republic of Korea 's First Division hurled itself on the enemy , shore fire control observers saw New Jersey 's salvos hit directly on enemy mortar emplacements , supply and ammunition dumps , and personnel concentrations . New Jersey returned to Wonsan 18 July for an exhibition of perfect firing : five gun emplacements demolished with five direct hits . 
 New Jersey sailed to the aid of troops of the Republic of Korea once more 17 August , returning to the Kansong area where for four days she provided harassing fire by night , and broke up counterattacks by day , inflicting a heavy toll on enemy troops . She returned to this general area yet again 29 August , when she fired in an amphibious demonstration staged behind enemy lines to ease pressure on the Republic of Korea 's troops . The next day she started a three @-@ day saturation of the <unk> area , with one of her own helicopters spotting the results : four buildings destroyed , road junctions smashed , railroad marshaling yards afire , tracks cut and uprooted , coal stocks scattered , and many buildings and warehouses set blazing . 
 Aside from a brief break in firing 23 September to take aboard wounded from the Korean frigate <unk> ( PF @-@ 62 ) , damaged by gunfire , New Jersey was heavily engaged in bombarding the Kansong area , supporting the movement of the U.S. X Corps . The pattern again was harassing fire by night , destruction of known targets by day . Enemy movement was restricted by the fire of her big guns . A bridge , a dam , several gun emplacements , mortar positions , pillboxes , bunkers , and two ammunition dumps were demolished . 
 On 1 October 1951 , General Omar Bradley , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and General Matthew B. Ridgeway , Commander in Chief Far East , came on board to confer with Admiral Martin . 
 Between 1 and 6 October New Jersey was in action daily at Kansong , Hamhung , Hungnam , Tanchon , and Songjin . Enemy bunkers and supply concentrations provided the majority of the targets at Kansong ; at the others New Jersey fired on railroads , tunnels , bridges , an oil refinery , trains , and shore batteries . She also engaged an enemy gun emplacement with her five @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) gun mounts , which New Jersey successfully destroyed . The Kojo area was her target 16 October as she sailed in company with HMS Belfast , pilots from HMAS Sydney spotting . The operation was well @-@ planned and coordinated , and excellent results were obtained . 
 Another highly satisfactory day was 16 October , when the spotter over the Kansong area reported " beautiful shooting every shot on target @-@ most beautiful shooting I have seen in five years . " This five @-@ hour bombardment leveled ten artillery positions , and in smashing trenches and bunkers inflicted some 500 enemy casualties . 
 New Jersey dashed up the North Korean coast raiding transportation facilities from 1 to 6 November . She struck at bridges , road , and rail installations at Wonsan , Hungnam , Tanchon , <unk> , Songjin , and Chongjin , leaving four bridges destroyed , others badly damaged , two marshaling yards badly torn up , and many feet of track destroyed . With renewed attacks on Kansong and near the Chang @-@ San @-@ Got Peninsula 11 and 13 November , New Jersey completed her first tour of duty in Korea . 
 Relieved as flagship by Wisconsin , New Jersey cleared Yokosuka for Hawaii , Long Beach and the Panama Canal , and returned to Norfolk 20 December for a six @-@ month overhaul . Between 19 July 1952 and 5 September , she sailed as flagship for Rear Admiral H. R. Thurber , who commanded the NROTC midshipman training cruise to Cherbourg , Lisbon , and the Caribbean . Now New Jersey prepared and trained for her second Korean tour , for which she sailed from Norfolk 5 March 1953 . 
 Shaping her course via the Panama Canal , Long Beach , and Hawaii , New Jersey reached Yokosuka 5 April , and next day relieved Missouri as flagship of Vice Admiral Joseph H. Clark , Commander 7th Fleet . On 12 April New Jersey returned to action by shelling Chongjin ; in seven minutes she scored seven direct hits , blowing away half the main communications building there . At Pusan two days later , New Jersey manned her rails to welcome the President of the Republic of Korea and Madame Rhee , and American Ambassador Ellis O. Briggs . 
 New Jersey fired on coastal batteries and buildings at Kojo 16 April ; on railway track and tunnels near Hungnam 18 April ; and on gun emplacements around Wonsan Harbor 20 April , silencing them in five areas after she had herself taken several near misses . Songjin provided targets 23 April . Here New Jersey scored six direct 16 inch ( 406 mm ) hits on a railroad tunnel and knocked out two rail bridges . 
 New Jersey provided artillery support for a major air and surface strike on Wonsan 1 May , as 7th Fleet planes both attacked the enemy and spotted for the battleship . She knocked out eleven Communist shore guns that day , and four days later destroyed the key observation post on the island of Hodo Pando , commanding the harbor . Two days later <unk> at Wonsan was her target . 
 New Jersey 's tenth birthday , 23 May 1953 , was celebrated at Incheon with President and Madame Rhee , Lieutenant General Maxwell D. Taylor , and other dignitaries on board . Two days later New Jersey returned to action along the west coast at <unk> to knock out harbor defense positions . 
 The battleship was under fire at Wonsan 27 May – 29 May , but her five @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) guns silenced the counter @-@ fire , and her 16 inch shells destroyed five gun emplacements and four gun caves . She also hit a target that flamed spectacularly : either a fuel storage area or an ammunition dump . 
 New Jersey returned to the key task of direct support to troops at Kosong 7 June . On her first mission , she completely destroyed two gun positions , an observation post , and their supporting trenches , then stood by on call for further aid . She then sailed back to Wonsan for a day @-@ long bombardment 24 June , aimed at guns placed in caves . The results were excellent , with eight direct hits on three caves , one cave demolished , and four others closed . Next day she returned to troop support at Kosong , her assignment until 10 July , aside from necessary withdrawal for replenishment . 
 At Wonsan 11 July – 12 July , New Jersey fired one of the most concentrated bombardments of her Korean duty . For nine hours the first day , and for seven the second , her guns opened fire on gun positions and bunkers on Hodo Pando and the mainland with telling effect . At least ten enemy guns were destroyed , many damaged , and a number of caves and tunnels sealed . New Jersey smashed radar control positions and bridges at Kojo 13 July , and was once more on the east coast bombline 22 July – 24 July to support South Korean troops near Kosong . These days found her gunners at their most accurate : A large cave , housing an important enemy observation post was closed , the end of a month @-@ long United Nations effort , and a great many bunkers , artillery areas , observation posts , trenches , tanks and other weapons were destroyed . 
 At sunrise on 25 July 1953 New Jersey was off the key port , rail and communications center of Hungnam , pounding coastal guns , bridges , a factory area , and oil storage tanks . She sailed north that afternoon , firing at rail lines and railroad tunnels as she made for Tanchon , where she launched a whaleboat in an attempt to spot a train known to run nightly along the coast . Her big guns were trained on two tunnels between which she hoped to catch the train , but in the darkness she could not see the results of her six @-@ gun salvo . 
 = = = Post Korean War ( 1953 – 1967 ) = = = 
 New Jersey 's mission at Wonsan , the next day , was her last . Here she destroyed large @-@ caliber guns , bunkers , caves and trenches . Two days later , she learned of the truce . Her crew celebrated during a seven @-@ day visit at Hong Kong , where she anchored 20 August . Operations around Japan and off Formosa were carried out for the remainder of her tour , which was highlighted by a visit to Pusan . Here president Rhee came aboard on 16 September to present the Korean Presidential Unit Citation to the 7th Fleet . 
 Relieved as flagship at Yokosuka by Wisconsin 14 October , New Jersey was homeward bound the next day , reaching Norfolk on 14 November . During the next two summers she crossed the Atlantic with midshipmen on board for training , and during the rest of the year sharpened her skills with exercises and training maneuvers along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean . 
 New Jersey stood out of Norfolk 7 September 1955 for her first tour of duty with the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean . Her ports of call included Gibraltar , Valencia , Cannes , Istanbul , Souda Bay ; and Barcelona . She returned to Norfolk 7 January 1956 for the spring program of training operations . That summer she again carried midshipmen to Northern Europe for training , bringing them home to Annapolis 31 July . New Jersey sailed for Europe once more 27 August as flagship of Vice Admiral Charles Wellborn , Jr . , Commander United States Second Fleet . She called at Lisbon , participated in NATO exercises off Scotland , and paid an official visit to Norway where Crown Prince Olav was a guest . She returned to Norfolk 15 October , and 14 December arrived at New York Naval Shipyard for inactivation . She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Bayonne 21 August 1957 .

 Due to heavy loss rates of U.S. aircraft ( commencing with Operation Rolling Thunder in 1965 ) , studies were conducted on ways of alleviating those air losses while at the same time delivering the ordnance payloads required by the escalation of the war . On 31 May 1967 the Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara authorized a study aimed at determining what would be required to get New Jersey reactivated in her present condition , and when the results of the submitted study proved favorable toward the reactivation he took action . In August 1967 the Secretary of Defense made the decision to recommission a battleship " for employment in the Pacific Fleet to augment the naval gunfire support force in Southeast Asia " . New Jersey was selected for this task because she was in better material condition than her sisters , having received an extensive overhaul prior to decommissioning . Upon her reactivation she underwent a period of modernization during which the 20 mm and 40 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns on the battleship were removed , and she received improved electronic warfare systems and improvements to her radar . Armed as such New Jersey was formally recommissioned 6 April 1968 at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard , Captain J. Edward Snyder in command . 
 New Jersey , then the world 's only active battleship , departed Philadelphia 16 May , calling at Norfolk and transiting the Panama Canal 4 June before arriving at her new home port of Long Beach , California , 11 June . Further training off Southern California followed . On 24 July New Jersey received 16 inch shells and powder tanks from Mount Katmai by conventional <unk> transfer and by helicopter lift , the first time heavy battleship ammunition had been transferred by helicopter at sea ( now known as vertical replenishment ) . 
 Departing Long Beach 2 September , New Jersey touched at Pearl Harbor and Subic Bay before sailing 25 September for her first tour on the gun line along the Vietnamese coast . Near the 17th parallel on 30 September , the battleship fired her first shots in battle in over sixteen years , expending a total of 29 sixteen inch rounds against People 's Army of Vietnam ( PAVN ) targets in and near the Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) at the 17th parallel . 
 New Jersey took up station off Tiger Island 1 October and fired at targets north of the DMZ before moving south that afternoon to engage Viet Cong targets . She accounted for six bunkers , a supply truck and an anti @-@ aircraft site that day ; additionally , she helped rescue the crew of a Marine spotting plane forced down at sea by anti @-@ aircraft fire . On 3 October New Jersey fired on targets south of Tiger Island , and on 4 October the battleship fired on a Communist troop concentration and destroyed several bunkers . On the evening of 7 October New Jersey received reports that a number of waterborne logistics craft were moving south near the mouth of the Song Giang River . New Jersey responded by closing on the formation , and succeeded in sinking eleven of the craft before they could beach . 
 On 11 October New Jersey engaged a coastal installation with her guns ; however , she shifted her fire when a recon plane spotting for the battleship reported an enemy truck concentration north of Nha Ky . New Jersey gunners quickly retrained the battleship 's big guns and managed to inflict heavy damage on six of the vehicles . 
 Early on the morning of 12 October New Jersey trained her guns in anticipation of shelling the heavily fortified and well protected Vinh caves . For the next three days New Jersey pounded the area with her 16 in shells in an effort to eliminate the Viet Cong presence in the region . Aided by spotter aircraft from the aircraft carrier America , New Jersey engaged enemy targets , setting several enemy positions on fire and sealing one cave . On 14 October New Jersey shifted her gunfire to the coastal artillery sites on Hon Matt Island , destroying one battery on the island . 
 On 16 October New Jersey took up station in support of the U.S. 3rd Marine Division . Using both the 16 in and 5 in guns New Jersey engaged and destroyed 13 structures and an artillery site , in the process halting an enemy platoon moving through the DMZ . New Jersey continued to lend firepower support on the 17th until departing to lend her gunfire to the First Field Force . Foul weather prevented spotter aircraft from flying until 20 October ; however , New Jersey quickly made up for lost time on the gun line by destroying a Viet Cong command post and nine bunkers in support of the 173rd Airborne Brigade , who were operating about 50 miles ( 80 km ) north of Nha Trang . The next day New Jersey maneuvered into the waters of the Baie de Van Fong to fire at Viet Cong command posts , but poor visibility of the target area prevented any damage estimates . 
 On the night of 23 October New Jersey steamed north to rearm before taking up position in support of the 3rd Marine Division 25 October . That day she shelled enemy troops located by a spotter plane . The next day New Jersey engaged targets of opportunity , destroying 11 structures , seven bunkers , a concrete observation tower , and an enemy trench line . She also received hostile fire when North Vietnamese gunners attempted to strike at New Jersey with artillery positioned near Cap Lay . Some ten to twelve rounds were launched at New Jersey ; however , the rounds fired landed well short of the battleship . Aerial spotters were called in to look at the suspected gun position ; they reported no artillery present but fresh tire tracks leading to a concealed area , suggesting that there had been artillery there earlier . Armed with this information New Jersey fired five 16 inch shells at the site , but in the darkness spotters were unable to confirm any hits . 
 On 28 October New Jersey steamed south to engage Communist targets . During the shelling aircraft spotting for the battleship reported taking heavy anti @-@ aircraft fire to the extreme north of the target zone ; subsequently , New Jersey altered her fire to silence the site with her big guns . The next day New Jersey leveled 30 structures , destroyed three underground bunkers , and shelled a Viet Cong trench line . That afternoon an aerial observer located an enemy artillery position on a hilltop southwest of Cap Lay . New Jersey responded by firing six 16 inch rounds at the site , destroying it . Follow up assaults on 30 October destroyed a Communist resupply area and an anti @-@ aircraft site . 
 Upon completion of this mission New Jersey steamed south , taking a position off Da Nang and Point <unk> to lend naval gunfire support to the U.S. 1st Marine Division operating in the area . On 2 November New Jersey commenced firing operations against nine positions , but the heavy foliage in the area prevented spotters from seeing the results of the shelling . 
 On 4 November New Jersey received orders to reinforce southern II Corps near Phan Thiết ; she arrived on station later that night . The next day she answered eight call for fire support missions from the 173rd Airborne Brigade , in the process destroying eight Viet Cong bunkers and five structures . On 11 November New Jersey departed Vietnamese waters to replenish ; she returned to the gunline 23 November and relieved Galveston , taking up position in support of the U.S. Army 's Americal Division . That afternoon New Jersey 's 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) guns shelled enemy buildings , destroying 15 structures and inflicted heavy damage on 29 others . 
 On 25 November New Jersey launched the most destructive shore bombardment of her Vietnam tour . For the next two days the battleship concentrated her fire at Viet Cong storage areas near Quảng Ngãi , destroying 182 structures and 54 bunkers , inflicting heavy damage to 93 structures , and demolishing several tunnel complexes before departing for Point Betsy near Hue 27 November to support the 101st Airborne Division . 
 Between 2 and 8 December New Jersey returned to aid the 3rd Marine Division , shelling Viet Cong bunker complexes for the Marines operating around the Da Nang area before departing for Singapore 9 December . On 26 December New Jersey returned to the gunline , taking up station off Tuy Hoa in support of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam 47th Division . For the next three days New Jersey fired her guns to support the II Corps , in the process destroying Viet Cong bunkers and supply depots and neutralizing enemy cave posts . New Jersey would remain in the waters of the DMZ until after New Years , shelling Communist bunkers for ground troops until leaving to support the 1st Marine Division 3 January . 
 Throughout January and into February New Jersey operated in support of the Marines . On 10 February the battleship left to reinforce the Korean 2nd Marine Brigade operating near Da Nang . The battleship 's target was a suspected subterranean staging area for a Viet Cong regiment . New Jersey 's big guns went to work on the complex , firing 16 inch shells into tunnels and bunkers to aid the ground troops . On 14 February the battleship steamed south of the DMZ to provide support for the 3rd Marine Division , in the process destroying an anti @-@ aircraft site with her big guns . The next day New Jersey fired on an enemy rocket site northeast of Con Thien , destroying the facility , then trained her guns on known Communist positions to harass PAVN forces . On 22 February New Jersey responded to an urgent request for fire support from the besieged <unk> observation post near the DMZ . For the next six hours New Jersey fired her guns , ultimately repelling the attacking force . 
 For the remainder of February and into March New Jersey shelled targets along the DMZ . On 13 March the battleship departed the gunline bound for Subic Bay . She returned to action on 20 March , operating near Cam Ranh Bay in support of the Korean 9th Infantry Division . For the next week New Jersey patrolled the waters between Phan <unk> and Tuy Hoa , shelling targets of opportunity along the coast . On 28 March New Jersey took up station south of the DMZ to aid the 3rd Marine Division , remaining there until 1 April , whereupon New Jersey departed for Japan . During the battleship 's tour of duty along the gunline in Vietnam , New Jersey had fired 5 @,@ 688 rounds of 16 inch shells , and 14 @,@ 891 rounds of 5 @-@ inch shells . 
 = = = Post Vietnam War ( 1969 – 1982 ) = = = 
 Her first Vietnam combat tour completed , New Jersey departed Subic Bay 3 April 1969 for Japan . She arrived at Yokosuka for a two @-@ day visit , sailing for the United States 9 April . Her homecoming , however , was to be delayed . On the 15th , while New Jersey was still at sea , North Korean jet fighters shot down an unarmed EC @-@ 121 Constellation electronic surveillance plane over the Sea of Japan , killing its entire crew . A carrier task force was formed and sent to the Sea of Japan , while New Jersey was ordered to come about and steam toward Japan . On the 22nd she arrived once more at Yokosuka , and immediately put to sea in readiness for what might befall . 
 As the crisis eased , New Jersey was released to continue her interrupted voyage . She anchored at Long Beach 5 May 1969 , her first visit to her home port in eight months . Through the summer months , New Jersey 's crew toiled to make her ready for another deployment , and deficiencies discovered on the gun line were remedied . According to official reports , though , reasons of economy were to dictate otherwise : on 22 August 1969 the United States Secretary of Defense released a list of names of ships to be inactivated ; at the top of the list was New Jersey . Five days later , Captain Snyder was relieved of command by Captain Robert C. Peniston . 
 Assuming command of a ship already earmarked for the " mothball fleet " , Captain Peniston and his crew prepared for their task . New Jersey got underway on the voyage 6 September , departing Long Beach for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard . She arrived on the 8th , and began <unk> overhaul to ready herself for decommissioning . On 17 December 1969 New Jersey 's colors were hauled down and she entered the inactive fleet , following the words of her last commanding officer : " Rest well , yet sleep lightly ; and hear the call , if again sounded , to provide fire power for freedom . " 
 = = Reactivation ( 1982 ) = = 
 As part of president Ronald Reagan 's and Navy Secretary John Lehman 's effort to create a 600 @-@ ship Navy , New Jersey was selected for reactivation in the spring of 1981 , and she was towed from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to Long Beach Naval Shipyard at the end of July 1981 for modernization / reactivation . At the time of the reactivation the Navy envisioned using New Jersey and her sister ship Iowa to meet sustained global requirements and relieve the strain on the Navy created by an increase in U.S. commitments to the Indian Ocean and Caribbean Sea regions . During this time the Navy developed several proposals to update their battleships to carry cruise missiles and anti @-@ ship missiles , as well as point defense system mounts . Preliminary modernizations schemes included the removal of four of the ten 5 inch gun mounts on New Jersey to make room for the armored box launchers that would be required to carry and launch the BGM @-@ 109 Tomahawk missiles . At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships ; however , it was determined that the system could not withstand the overpressure effects when firing the main battery . 
 On 28 December 1982 New Jersey was formally recommissioned at Long Beach , California , her new homeport . The recommissioning of New Jersey marked a return of the world 's last battleships after a 13 @-@ year absence from the world 's oceans . 
 New Jersey 's modernization was unique in that she was to be the only reactivated Iowa @-@ class battleship to lose a gun turret . At the time the Navy made the announcement plans were underway to remove New Jersey 's No. 3 16 in gun turret ( located aft of the superstructure ) . In its place the Navy planned to install one of two systems : a vertical launching missile magazine which would have enabled New Jersey to carry an additional 48 Tomahawk or Harpoon missiles , or using the space generated by a removed gun turret for aircraft related updates centering on VTOL or V / STOL type aircraft ; however these ideas were ultimately dropped , and New Jersey retained her No. 3 Gun Turret during her 1980s career . 
 Over the next several months the ship was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available ; among the new weapons systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 AGM @-@ 84 Harpoon anti @-@ ship missiles , eight Armored Box Launcher ( ABL ) mounts for 32 BGM @-@ 109 Tomahawk missiles , and a quartet of the United States Navy 's Phalanx Close in Weapon System ( CIWS ) Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti @-@ ship missiles and enemy aircraft . New Jersey also received eight RQ @-@ 2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicles , which are remotely controlled drones that replaced the helicopters previously used to spot for her nine 16 " / 50 Mark 7 guns . Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire control systems for her guns and missiles , and improved electronic warfare capabilities . 
 Because New Jersey had been recalled for service in the Vietnam War her modernization differed from her sisters for a number of reasons . When reactivated in 1967 New Jersey had her 20 mm Oerlikon and 40 mm Bofors anti @-@ aircraft guns removed , and received improved electronic warfare capabilities . This alteration helped reduce the time it took get New Jersey recommissioned : since she was not in her World War II format the only major physical alteration to New Jersey involved the removal of four of her ten 5 inch gun mounts to make room for the Armored Box Launchers . In addition to saving time , this also made New Jersey cheaper to reactivate since the cost needed to modernize the battleship only included the addition of missile and gun system mounts , electronic warfare suites , and improved radar and gun spotter technology . 
 Since the Tomahawk missile system had not yet been adopted for use during New Jersey 's original update the Navy announced plans to divert assets from two of their Spruance @-@ class destroyers to install the necessary Tomahawk launchers . Similarly , assets were diverted from two Farragut @-@ class guided missile destroyers to allow for the installation of Harpoon launchers on New Jersey . 
 = = Lebanese Civil War ( 1983 – 1984 ) = = 
 In 1983 , a bloody civil war was raging in Lebanon . In an effort to stop the violence in the region a Multinational Force of peacekeepers composed largely of U.S. , Italian and French armed service members was created and sent to the region to attempt a restoration of order . As part of the multinational force the United States mobilized an expeditionary force composed of members of the United States Marine Corps and elements of the United States Sixth Fleet which operated out of the Mediterranean Sea . 
 On 18 April 1983 a van carrying a 2 @,@ 000 pound load of explosives , slammed into the U.S. embassy in West Beirut , killing 63 . In August 1983 , Israel withdrew its Defense Forces from the <unk> District ( southeast of Beirut ) , thus removing the buffer between the Druze and the Christian militias and triggering another round of brutal fighting . In August 1983 militiamen began to bombard United States Marines positions near Beirut International Airport with mortar and rocket fire as the Lebanese Army fought Druze and Shia forces in the southern suburbs of Beirut . On 29 August 1983 , two Marines were killed and fourteen wounded , and in the ensuing months the Marines came under almost daily attack from artillery , mortar , rocket , and small @-@ arms fire . After this attack the Marines began returning fire . The Reagan Administration decided to dispatch New Jersey , a decision the Marines cheered . 
 On 16 September 1983 Druze forces massed on the threshold of Suk El Gharb , a village defended by the Lebanese Army . Suk El Gharb was a village with strategic importance : the militias coming up from the south had to traverse Suk El Gharb to get to the Beirut – Aley road . Moreover , Suk El Gharb controlled a ridge that overlooked Baabda , <unk> , which was the location of the Ministry of Defence , and East Beirut . From that ridge , the Militia gunners could shoot directly downhill at those locations with artillery . United States Navy warships shelled Druze positions and helped the Lebanese Army hold the town of Suk El Gharb until a cease @-@ fire was declared on 25 September , on which day the battleship New Jersey arrived on the scene . The arrival of New Jersey was one of several factors contributing to a reduction in the number of attacks on the Marines . 
 On 28 November — after 23 October 1983 Beirut barracks bombing — the U.S. government announced that New Jersey would be retained off Beirut although her crew would be rotated . On 14 December , New Jersey fired 11 projectiles from her 16 inch ( 406 mm ) guns at hostile positions inland of Beirut . These were the first 16 inch ( 406 mm ) shells fired for effect anywhere in the world since New Jersey ended her time on the gunline in Vietnam in 1969 . This shelling was in response to attacks on U.S. reconnaissance planes by Syrian / Druze antiaircraft batteries . 
 Carrying on a tradition he had begun in World War II of spending Christmas with U.S. forces overseas , Bob Hope and his troupe of entertainers gave a show on board the New Jersey on 24 December 1983 . Four hundred Marines stationed in Beirut attended the show . 
 On 8 February 1984 , New Jersey fired almost 300 shells at Druze and Shi 'ite positions in the hills overlooking Beirut . Some 30 of these massive projectiles rained down on a Syrian command post in the Bekaa Valley east of Beirut , killing the general commanding Syrian forces in Lebanon and several other senior officers . This was the heaviest shore bombardment since the Korean War . 
 Although New Jersey performed her job expertly during the intervention in Lebanon some have criticized the decision to have New Jersey shell Druze and Syrian forces . Members of this camp allege that this action forced a shift in the previously neutral U.S. forces by convincing local Lebanese Muslims that the United States had taken the Christian side ; New Jersey 's shells had killed hundreds of people , mostly Shiites and Druze . In his memoir , General Colin Powell ( at the time an assistant to Caspar Weinberger ) noted that " When the shells started falling on the Shiites , they assumed the American ‘ referee ’ had taken sides . " 
 The accuracy of New Jersey 's guns was also called into question . An investigation into New Jersey 's gunfire effectiveness in Lebanon , led by Marine Colonel Don Price , found that many of the ship 's shells had missed their targets by as much as 10 @,@ 000 yards ( 9 @,@ 140 m ) and therefore may have inadvertently killed civilians . Tim McNulty , a correspondent for the Chicago Tribune based in Lebanon said , " Everybody loved the New Jersey until she fired her guns . Once she fired , it was obvious she couldn 't hit anything . " The inaccuracy is believed to have resulted because the ship 's main gunpowder had been remixed by the Navy , under the direction of Captain Joseph Dominick Miceli at the Naval Weapons Support Center , and <unk> . Powder lots ( an individual production of powder ) burn at different rates . Therefore , remixing the powder lots could cause the guns to fire inconsistently . The problem was apparently resolved after the Navy was able to locate additional powder supplies which had not been remixed . 
 = = = Post @-@ Lebanese deployment ( 1984 – 1990 ) = = = 
 In 1986 New Jersey began her next deployment , this time operating as part of the Pacific Fleet and as the centerpiece of her own battle group . This was first time that New Jersey had operational control of her own group of escorts since the Korean War , and she cruised from Hawaii to Thailand in 1986 , freeing up U.S. aircraft carriers for other missions and in the process becoming the only major U.S. naval presence in the region from May to October . Although in command of her own Battleship Battlegroup New Jersey did sail with the aircraft carriers USS Ranger ( CV @-@ 61 ) and USS Constellation ( CV @-@ 64 ) and USS Thach ( FFG @-@ 43 ) while deployed in 1986 . 
 According to a declassified command history for the nuclear @-@ armed battleship New Jersey , during her transit through the Sea of Okhotsk on 27 – 28 September 1986 , " close passes " were made by Soviet Bear and Badger bombers , a Hormone helicopter , and a May maritime patrol airplane . A Kara @-@ class cruiser and two Grisha III frigates also shadowed the U.S. ships . The maneuver , according to the command history , " marked the first time a U.S. battleship had operated in the Soviet Navy 's backyard . " 
 Following an overhaul at Long Beach which lasted into 1988 New Jersey returned to the Pacific Ocean , this time operating as part of a surface action group . The battleship operated near the coast of Korea prior to the opening of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul , South Korea , then departed for Australia to participate in the Australian bicentennial celebrations . 
 In April 1989 , as New Jersey was preparing for her last operational cruise , sister ship Iowa suffered a catastrophic explosion in her No. 2 gun turret ; fallout from the incident led U.S. Naval officials to freeze live fire exercises with the guns until the investigation into the explosion was concluded . Eventually , the ban was lifted and New Jersey was allowed to use her big guns again . 
 New Jersey 's final cruise began in 1989 as part of Pacific Exercise ' 89 . Upon completion of the exercise , New Jersey sailed through the Indian Ocean and into the Persian Gulf , in the process becoming the centerpiece for various battle groups and surface action groups . New Jersey remained in the Persian Gulf for the rest of the year , returning to the United States in February 1990 . 
 = = Reserve fleet and museum ship ( 1991 – present ) = = 
 With the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the lack of a perceived threat against the United States came drastic cuts to the defense budget , and the high cost of maintaining battleships as part of the active fleet became uneconomical ; as a result , New Jersey was decommissioned for the final time at Naval Station Long Beach , California , on 8 February 1991 , with the ship serving a total of 21 years ( the most of the four Iowa 's ) in active service . The decision to decommission New Jersey robbed the battleship of the chance to participate in Operation Desert Storm in 1991 , a military campaign to forcibly remove Iraqi invasion troops from Kuwait . Hostilities had commenced on or about 15 January 1991 and sister ships Missouri and Wisconsin were engaging Iraqi targets with Tomahawk missiles at the time of New Jersey 's decommissioning . Following her decommissioning New Jersey was towed to Bremerton , Washington , where she remained in reserve until struck from the Naval Vessel Register in January 1995 . 
 Section 1011 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 required the United States Navy to reinstate to the Naval Vessel Register two of the Iowa @-@ class battleships that had been struck by the Navy in 1995 ; these ships were to be maintained in the United States Navy reserve fleets ( or " mothball fleet " ) . The Navy was to ensure that both of the reinstated battleships were in good condition and could be reactivated for use in the Marine Corps ' amphibious operations . Due to Iowa 's damaged Turret 2 the Navy selected New Jersey for placement into the mothball fleet , even though the training mechanisms on New Jersey 's 16 @-@ in guns had been welded down . The cost to fix New Jersey was considered less than the cost to fix Iowa ; as a result , New Jersey and Wisconsin were reinstated to the Naval Vessel Register and placed back in the reserve fleet . 
 New Jersey remained in mothball fleet until the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999 passed through the United States Congress 18 October 1998 . Section 1011 required the United States Secretary of the Navy to list and maintain Iowa and Wisconsin on the Naval Vessel Register , while Section 1012 required the Secretary of the Navy to strike New Jersey from the Naval Vessel Register and transfer the battleship to a not @-@ for @-@ profit entity in accordance with section <unk> of Title 10 , United States Code . Section 1012 also required the <unk> to locate the battleship in the State of New Jersey . The Navy made the switch in January 1999 , and on 12 September , New Jersey was towed by the tug Sea Victory from Bremerton , Washington to Philadelphia , for restoration work in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in advance of her planned donation for use as a museum . 
 Two competing requests for the battleships were filed , one by the USS New Jersey Battleship Commission of Bayonne , New Jersey , and one by the Home Port Alliance of Camden , New Jersey . Both teams worked hard to develop a comprehensive plan to operate and maintain the battleship as a museum . After a review of both of the submitted plans , the Navy selected the Home Port Alliance as the battleship 's final resting place . Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig made the announcement on 20 January 2000 , and on 15 October of that year New Jersey arrived at her final resting place on the Camden Waterfront . 
 Shortly after her arrival New Jersey was opened to the public , officially beginning her new career as a museum ship with the name Battleship New Jersey Museum and Memorial . Self @-@ guided tours , guided group tours , and overnight encampments are offered on the floating museum . Overnight encampments , typically for the benefit of Scouting organizations , offer the opportunity to sleep and eat in the original berths and mess decks . 
 New Jersey has been placed on several historic registers . In 1997 , while the ship was still in the mothball fleet , the New Jersey State Review Board for Historic Sites recommended that it " be listed in the New Jersey Register of Historic Places , contingent upon the transfer of the battleship to New Jersey waters . " In 2004 , the State of New Jersey officially designated the battleship as an historical place . This cleared New Jersey for placement on the National Register of Historic Places , a list to which New Jersey was officially added in 2004 . 
 In early 2012 there was debate on whether or not the USS New Jersey should be moved to Liberty State Park . Ultimately , nothing came from the debate and the ship remains in Camden .

 Among other awards , New Jersey earned the Navy Unit Commendation for Vietnam service , the Presidential Unit Citation from the Republic of the Philippines , and the Presidential Unit Citation from the Republic of Korea . She received nine battle stars for her World War II service , four for her service in the Korean War , two for her service in the Vietnam War , and four for service in Lebanon and the Persian Gulf region . Due to her outstanding service record , New Jersey holds the distinction of being the most decorated battleship in US history . 
 = French battleship Vérité = 
 Vérité was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship of the Liberté class built by the French Navy . She had three sister ships : Liberté , Justice , and Démocratie . Vérité was laid down in April 1903 , launched in May 1907 , and completed in June 1908 , over a year after the revolutionary British battleship HMS Dreadnought made ships like Vérité obsolete . She was armed with a main battery of four 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) guns , compared to the ten guns of the same caliber mounted on Dreadnought . 
 Vérité took the French President on a goodwill trip to Russia in 1908 and visited America in September 1909 . In September 1911 , she was damaged by the explosion that destroyed her sister Liberté in Toulon . At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , she covered troop convoys from North Africa to France along with the rest of the French Mediterranean Fleet . She spent the rest of the war based at Corfu and later Mudros , without seeing any action at either location . After the end of the war , she was stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap in 1922 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Vérité was laid down at the Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde shipyard in Bordeaux in April 1903 , launched on 28 May 1907 , and completed in June 1908 , over a year after the radically innovative British battleship HMS Dreadnought , which rendered the pre @-@ dreadnoughts like Vérité outdated before they were completed . The ship was 133 @.@ 81 meters ( 439 ft 0 in ) long between perpendiculars and had a beam of 24 @.@ 26 m ( 79 ft 7 in ) and a full @-@ load draft of 8 @.@ 41 m ( 27 ft 7 in ) . She displaced up to 14 @,@ 489 metric tons ( 14 @,@ 260 long tons ; 15 @,@ 971 short tons ) at full load . The ship had a crew of between 739 and 769 officers and enlisted men . Vérité was powered by three vertical triple expansion engines with twenty @-@ two Belleville boilers . They were rated at 18 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 13 @,@ 800 kW ) and provided a top speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . Coal storage amounted to 1 @,@ 800 t ( 1 @,@ 800 long tons ; 2 @,@ 000 short tons ) . 
 Vérité 's main battery consisted of four Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893 / 96 guns mounted in two twin gun turrets , one forward and one aft . The secondary battery consisted of ten Canon de 194 mm Modèle 1902 guns ; six were mounted in single turrets , and four in casemates in the hull . She also carried thirteen 9 @-@ pounder guns and ten 3 @-@ pounders . Additionally , the ship was armed with two 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes submerged in the hull . The ship 's main belt was 280 mm ( 11 @.@ 0 in ) thick and the main battery was protected by up to 350 mm ( 13 @.@ 8 in ) of armor . The conning tower had 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) thick sides . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Vérité 's first major assignment was received in late July 1908 , a month after she joined the French fleet . She carried the President of France Armand Fallières to Reval , Russia , arriving on 27 July . There , Fallières visited with the Russian Tsar , Nicholas II , who inspected Vérité . She joined Liberté and Justice for a visit to the United States for the Hudson @-@ Fulton Celebration in September 1909 . The three ships , representing France during the celebrations and commanded by Admiral Jules le Pord , were the first foreign ships to arrive . The ships departed from Brest and reached New York seven days later , having run at an average of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) ; the performance of the ships ' propulsion systems was regarded as satisfactory by contemporary naval experts , including the United States Naval Institute . In early 1911 , the French Navy conducted experiments with wireless telegraphy , and used Vérité and Justice for the tests . The wireless transmitters could pick up messages as far as 72 miles ( 116 km ) away . On 25 September 1911 , Liberté was destroyed by an accidental explosion in Toulon , the result of the spontaneous combustion of nitrocellulose gel in her ammunition magazines . Debris hurled by the explosion damaged several nearby battleships , including Vérité . 
 At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Vérité was assigned to the 1st Division of the 2nd Squadron in the Mediterranean , along with République and Patrie . The French fleet was initially used to cover the movement of French troops — the XIX Corps — from Algeria to metropolitan France . As a result , the fleet was far out of position to catch the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben , which , contrary to French expectations , steamed to Constantinople rather than attempt to interfere with the troop transports . For the majority of the war , the French used their main fleet to keep the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet bottled up in the Adriatic Sea . In 1914 she participated in the Battle of Antivari , where the battle line caught the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruiser SMS Zenta by surprise and sank her . The French battleships then bombarded Austrian fortifications at Cattaro in an attempt to draw out the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet , which refused to take the bait . 
 The French operations in the area were hampered by a lack of a suitable base close to the mouth of the Adriatic ; the British had given the French free access to Malta , but it was hundreds of miles away . The Austrians also possessed several submarines , one of which torpedoed the dreadnought Jean Bart in December 1914 . The threat from underwater weapons greatly limited French naval activities in the Adriatic . As the war progressed , the French eventually settled on Corfu as their primary naval base in the area . Later in the war , Vérité was sent to Mudros along with her sister ships . After the end of the war , Vérité was stricken from the naval register in 1922 and subsequently broken up for scrap .

 = = Plot = = 
 In the present day , scientists in the Arctic uncover an old , frozen aircraft . In March 1942 , Nazi officer Johann Schmidt and his men steal a mysterious relic called the Tesseract , which possesses untold powers , from the town of Tønsberg in German @-@ occupied Norway . 
 In New York City , Steve Rogers is rejected for World War II military recruitment because of various health and physical problems . While attending an exhibition of future technologies with his friend , Sgt. James " Bucky " Barnes , Rogers again attempts to enlist . Overhearing Rogers ' conversation with Barnes about wanting to help in the war , Dr. Abraham Erskine allows Rogers to enlist . He is recruited into the Strategic Scientific Reserve as part of a " super @-@ soldier " experiment under Erskine , Col. Chester Phillips , and British agent Peggy Carter . Phillips is unconvinced by Erskine 's claims that Rogers is the right person for the procedure but relents after seeing Rogers commit an act of self @-@ sacrificing bravery . The night before the treatment , Erskine reveals to Rogers that Schmidt underwent an imperfect version of the procedure and suffered permanent side @-@ effects . 
 Schmidt and Dr. Arnim Zola harness the energies of the Tesseract , intending to use the power to fuel Zola 's inventions , mounting an offensive that will change the world . Schmidt discovers Erskine 's location and dispatches assassin Heinz Kruger to kill him . Erskine subjects Rogers to the super @-@ soldier treatment , injecting him with a special serum and dosing him with " vita @-@ rays " . After Rogers emerges from the experiment taller and more muscular , an undercover Kruger kills Erskine and flees . Rogers pursues and captures Kruger , but the assassin avoids interrogation by committing suicide with a cyanide capsule . With Erskine dead and his super @-@ soldier formula lost , U.S. Senator Brandt has Rogers tour the nation in a colorful costume as " Captain America " to promote war bonds while scientists study him and attempt to rediscover the formula . In 1943 , while on tour in Italy performing for active servicemen , Rogers learns that Barnes 's unit was MIA in a battle against Schmidt 's forces . Refusing to believe that Barnes is dead , Rogers has Carter and engineer Howard Stark fly him behind enemy lines to mount a solo rescue attempt . Rogers infiltrates the fortress of Schmidt 's Nazi division Hydra , freeing Barnes and the other prisoners . Rogers confronts Schmidt , who removes a mask to reveal a red , skull @-@ like visage that earned him the sobriquet " the Red Skull " . Schmidt escapes and Rogers returns to base with the freed soldiers . 
 Rogers recruits Barnes , Dum Dum Dugan , Gabe Jones , Jim Morita , James Montgomery <unk> , and Jacques Dernier to attack other known Hydra bases . Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment , most notably a circular shield made of vibranium , a rare , nearly indestructible metal . Rogers and his team sabotage various Hydra operations . The team later assaults a train carrying Zola . Rogers and Jones succeed in capturing Zola , but Barnes falls from the train to his assumed death . Using information extracted from Zola , the final Hydra stronghold is located , and Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt from using weapons of mass destruction on major cities around the world . Rogers climbs aboard Schmidt 's aircraft as it takes off , and during the subsequent fight the Tesseract 's container is damaged . Schmidt physically handles the Tesseract , causing him to dissolve in a bright light . The Tesseract burns through the plane and is lost in the ocean . Seeing no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating its weapons , Rogers crashes it in the Arctic . Stark later recovers the Tesseract from the ocean floor but is unable to locate Rogers or the aircraft , presuming him dead . 
 Rogers awakens in a 1940s @-@ style hospital room . Deducing from an anachronistic radio broadcast that something is wrong , he flees outside and finds himself in present @-@ day Times Square , where S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury informs him that he has been " asleep " for nearly 70 years . In a post @-@ credits scene , Fury approaches Rogers and proposes a mission with worldwide ramifications . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America : 
 A frail , sickly young man who is enhanced to the peak of human ability by an experimental serum in order to aid the United States war effort . Evans , who previously worked with Marvel as the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four film series , said he declined the part three times before signing a six @-@ picture deal with Marvel , explaining that , " At the time , I remember telling a buddy of mine , ' If the movie bombs , I 'm f — -ed [ sic ] . If the movie hits , I 'm f — -ed ! ' I was just scared . I realized my whole decision @-@ making process was fear @-@ based , and you never want to make a decision out of fear . I can 't believe I was almost too chicken to play Captain America " . He ultimately agreed to the role , saying , " I think Marvel is doing a lot of good things right now , and it 's a fun character . ... I think the story of Steve Rogers is great . He 's a great guy . Even if it [ were ] just a script about anybody , I would probably want to do it . So it wasn 't necessarily about the comic itself . " Regarding the extent of the character 's abilities Evans remarked , " He would crush the Olympics . Any Olympic sport he 's gonna dominate . He can jump higher , run faster , lift stronger weight , but he can be injured . He could roll an ankle and be out for the season . He 's not perfect , he 's not untouchable . So a lot of the effects , if I 'm going to punch someone they 're not going to put them on a cable and fly them back 50 feet , but he 's going to go down , probably not getting back up , which I think humanizes it . It makes it something that , again , I think everyone can relate to a little bit more , which I really like . " Theater actor Leander <unk> was the body double in some shots for Steve Rogers ' pre @-@ transformation physique as well as appearing as a bartender . 
 Tommy Lee Jones as Chester Phillips : 
 A colonel in the United States Army and member of the Strategic Scientific Reserve who heads the project to create super soldiers . The character was updated from the comics , where Phillips was the one to recruit Rogers to join Project Rebirth that made him Captain America . Jones described the character as " the one you 've seen in a thousand movies : the gruff , skeptical officer overseeing a team of talented , slightly sarcastic , specially talented soldiers " . 
 Hugo Weaving as Johann Schmidt / Red Skull : 
 Adolf Hitler 's head of advanced weaponry and commander of the terrorist organization Hydra , whose own plan for world domination involves harnessing the power of the magical object known as the Tesseract . Weaving stated that he patterned Red Skull 's accent on those of Werner Herzog and Klaus Maria Brandauer . About the character , Weaving remarked , " I think the major difference between Skull and Cap , they 've both had the serum , and the serum seems to augment certain qualities that each of them have . Cap is much more in tune with other people I think . Schmidt is in tune with himself , and his own needs , and his own ego , so I suppose it augments that . From that point of view , they 're quite opposite . " 
 Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter : 
 An officer with the Strategic Scientific Reserve who works with Phillips on the super soldier project and the love interest of Rogers . Regarding her preparation for the role , she said , " I 'm training at the moment six days a week to make her a bit more military and make it convincing that I could kick butt . " About the character , Atwell stated , " I likened her character to that famous Ginger Rogers quote . She can do everything Captain America can do , but backwards and in high heels . She 's an English soldier through and through , although she always looks fabulous . She might stand there with a machine @-@ gun shooting Nazis , but she 's obviously gone to the loo beforehand and applied a bit of lipstick . She doesn 't need to be rescued . That 's exciting to me – her strength " . She added , " I think she 's quite stubborn , a slightly frustrated woman who struggles with being a woman in that time . But more importantly she 's a modern woman and she sees something in Captain America that she relates to , and becomes kindred spirits . He treats her very differently to how she 's been treated by lots of men , in this kind of dominated world she lives in . So she 's very much a fighter . " 
 Sebastian Stan as James " Bucky " Barnes : 
 A sergeant in the United States Army , Rogers ' best friend and member of his squad of commandos . Stan has signed on for " five or six pictures " . He revealed that he did not know anything about the comic books , but watched a lot of documentaries and films about World War II in preparation for the role , calling Band of Brothers " very helpful " . About the role , Stan stated , " Steve Rogers and Bucky are both orphans and kind of like brothers . They kind of grow up together and look after each other . It 's a very human , relatable thing ... I also wanted to look out for how their relationship changes once Steve Rogers becomes Captain America . There 's always a competition and they 're always one @-@ upping each other . I paid attention to how Bucky is affected by Steve 's change and suddenly Steve is this leader " . 
 Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark : 
 The father of Tony Stark , who worked on various government projects dating back to the World War II era . About the role , Cooper stated , " It 's an opportunity where you can see his future because I know the guy who becomes my son and I see myself as an older version in Iron Man 2 which is great for an actor to have those tools . All I know of him is that he 's a fantastic engineer and inventor and a very slick Howard Hughes type that 's into aviation and women ! " 
 Neal McDonough as Timothy " Dum Dum " Dugan : 
 A member of Steve Rogers ' squad of commandos . McDonough said he grew Dugan 's trademark mustache and wore the character 's signature bowler hat . About his role in film he remarked , " Oh , I 'm going to see a lot of action . [ I 'm ] the go @-@ to guy , so I 'm very happy with that . " 
 Derek Luke as Gabe Jones : 
 A member of Rogers ' squad of commandos . Luke said he was cast without a script or much of a description of the character . As to why he took the part , " I just believed that Marvel was doing some really great work , great messages in films . The good versus evil and I was just like , ' How can I be down ? ' " 
 Stanley Tucci as Abraham Erskine : 
 The scientist who created the Super Soldier Serum . Tucci said that what drew him to the role was the opportunity to do a German accent , which was something he always wanted to try . 
 Samuel L. Jackson reprises his role as Nick Fury , the director of the super @-@ spy agency , S.H.I.E.L.D. Kenneth Choi appears as Jim Morita , a Japanese @-@ American member of Rogers ' squad of commandos . Choi said he was the last actor to audition for the part and that he read sides from Saving Private Ryan . About his preparation for the role , Choi said , " [ I ] did a lot of WWII research especially in regards to the ' Nisei ' soldiers , or Japanese @-@ American soldiers . I wanted to get as much true , real @-@ life information for a guy like Jim Morita fighting in WWII . I felt that if I had built a factual basis for him , I could then let go and permit the character to exist in the Marvel Universe , which allows for a lot of imaginative circumstances . " Bruno Ricci stars as Jacques Dernier , a French member of Rogers ' squad of commandos . Ricci auditioned for and got the part while filming the French series The Hawk . JJ Feild appears as James Montgomery <unk> , a British member of Rogers ' squad of commandos . Feild called his part in the film " a very physical job . I play one of the Captain 's sidekicks so I 've been running around shooting things and blowing things up and trying to look cool for about a year . " Additionally , Toby Jones was cast as Arnim Zola , a biochemist for the Nazi party , Richard Armitage portrays Heinz Kruger , the Red Skull 's top assassin , Lex Shrapnel portrays Gilmore Hodge , a candidate for the super soldier program , Michael Brandon portrays Brandt , a United States Senator who recognizes the PR potential of Captain America , Natalie Dormer portrays Lorraine , a private who attempts to seduce Rogers , and Jenna Coleman appears as Connie , Bucky 's date at the World Expo . Stan Lee has a cameo appearance as a general .

 = = = Development = = = 
 In April 1997 , Marvel was in negotiations with Mark Gordon and Gary <unk> to produce Captain America , and Larry Wilson and Leslie <unk> were set to write a script . In May 2000 , Marvel teamed with Artisan Entertainment to help finance the film . However , a lawsuit arose between Marvel Comics and Joe Simon over the ownership of Captain America copyrights , disrupting the development process of the film . The lawsuit was eventually settled in September 2003 . In 2005 , Marvel received a $ 525 million investment from Merrill Lynch , allowing them to independently produce ten films , including Captain America . Paramount Pictures agreed to distribute the film . Originally , the film would stand alone ; producer Kevin Feige said " about half " the movie would be set during World War II before moving into the modern day . Producer Avi Arad said , " The biggest opportunity with Captain America is as a man ' out of time ' , coming back today , looking at our world through the eyes of someone who thought the perfect world was small @-@ town United States . Sixty years go by , and who are we today ? Are we better ? " He cited the Back to the Future trilogy as an influence , and claimed he had " someone in mind to be the star , and definitely someone in mind to be the director " . In February 2006 , Arad hoped to have a summer 2008 theatrical release date . Jon Favreau approached Arad to direct the film as a comedy , but he chose to make Iron Man instead . In April 2006 , David Self was hired to write the script . He explained that Captain America was his favorite superhero as a child because " my dad told me I could one day be Captain America " . Joe Johnston met with Marvel to discuss directing the film . 
 Captain America was put on hold during the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike . However , in January 2008 , Marvel Entertainment reached an interim comprehensive agreement with the Writers Guild of America that would put writers immediately back to work on various projects that were under the company 's development . On May 5 , 2008 ( after the success of Iron Man ) , Marvel announced the film The First Avenger : Captain America ( the working title ) for release in May 6 , 2011 ( before being pushed back to July 22 ) . Louis Leterrier , director of The Incredible Hulk , viewed some of the concept art being created for the film and was impressed enough to offer his services , but Marvel turned him down . Johnston finally signed on in November 2008 , and he hired Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely to rewrite . Feige cited Johnston 's directorial work on October Sky and The Rocketeer and his special effects work on the original Star Wars trilogy to explain why he was an appropriate choice . Raiders of the Lost Ark was an influence on the film , because they hoped the film would not feel like a period piece . 
 When asked whether anti @-@ US sentiments would affect the film 's box office , Feige said , " Marvel is perceived pretty well around the world right now , and I think putting another uber @-@ Marvel hero into the worldwide box office would be a good thing . ... We have to deal with much the same way that Captain America , when thawed from the Arctic ice , entered a world that he didn 't recognize , " similar to the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced the character in the 1960s . Likewise , Arad noted , " Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies , for hope all around the world . He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then . So I think that we will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world , it 's not about one place , it 's about the world and I think [ on ] that basis it will be very successful . " Later , after the election of US President Barack Obama , Feige commented , " The idea of change and hope has permeated the country , regardless of politics , and that includes Hollywood . Discussions in all our development meetings include the Zeitgeist and how it 's changed in the last two weeks . Things are being adjusted " . 
 = = = Pre @-@ production = = = 
 In December 2009 , director Joe Johnston indicated that he planned to start filming in April 2010 . In a separate interview that month , he described the film 's pre @-@ production : " Rick Heinrichs is production @-@ designing and we 're set up down in Manhattan Beach , California . ... We have eight or ten really talented artists , and we all just sit around all day and draw pictures and say , ' Hey , wouldn 't it be cool if we could do this ? ' It 's that phase of the production where money doesn 't matter : ' Let 's put all the greatest stuff up on the wall and [ then later ] see what we can afford . ' " The film , he said , will begin " in 1942 , 1943 " during World War II . " The stuff in the ' 60s and ' 70s [ comic books ] we 're sort of avoiding . We 're going back to the ' 40s , and then forward to what they 're doing with Captain America now . " In February 2010 , Johnston stated that the Invaders will appear in " the entire second half " of the film , leading fans to speculate this was the World War II @-@ era Marvel superhero team of that name , and in November Johnston refuted speculation that the Sub @-@ Mariner , an Invaders team @-@ member in the comics , would be included . Johnston later explained that " the Invaders " had been discussed simply as a possible name for the squad of commandos Captain America leads in the film . Christopher Markus , one of the screenwriters , said the unnamed group was " called the Howling Commandos in the script , but no one says that out loud . " 
 The design as a whole tried to create technology that could be built in the 1940s , though with the added Cube technology in Hydra 's case . Abandoned Nazi projects or actual vehicles from the period were used as inspiration . Daniel Simon , who was previously responsible for many vehicle designs in TRON : Legacy , was appointed Lead Vehicle Designer . Director Johnston cited Simon 's book Cosmic Motors as a reason to trust his influence , saying " he 's sort of the guy I wanted to be when I was designing stuff for Star Wars " . The Red Skull 's car , for instance , was based on two Mercedes @-@ Benz vehicles from the 1930s , the <unk> and the G4 . 
 Variety reported in March 2010 that Chris Evans was cast as Captain America and Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull ; Marvel Studios confirmed the latter in May . Ryan Phillippe and John Krasinski were also considered for the role of Captain America . In April 2010 , Sebastian Stan , who had been mentioned in media accounts as a possibility for the title role , was cast as Bucky Barnes . Stan is contracted for multiple films . Also in April , Marvel announced that Hayley Atwell had been cast as Peggy Carter , and that the film 's name had been changed from The First Avenger : Captain America to Captain America : The First Avenger . The next day it was reported that Joss Whedon would be rewriting the script as part of his negotiation to write and direct The Avengers . Whedon said in August , " I just got to make some character connections . The structure of the thing was really tight and I loved it , but there were a couple of opportunities to find his voice a little bit — and some of the other characters ' — and make the connections so that you understood exactly why he wanted to be who he wanted to be . And progressing through the script to flesh it out a little bit " . Samuel L. Jackson revealed in an interview that he would reprise his role as Nick Fury in the film . 
 In May , Toby Jones entered final negotiations to play Arnim Zola . Iron Man director Jon Favreau said a younger Howard Stark would appear in the film , played by Dominic Cooper . Atwell revealed that Tommy Lee Jones would have a role in the film . By June , Neal McDonough was in talks to play Dum Dum Dugan . Four days later , he confirmed he was taking the part . The same day , Stanley Tucci joined the cast as Dr. Abraham Erskine , the scientist who created the super @-@ soldier serum . In November 2013 , McDonough revealed that he is signed to appear in multiple projects for Marvel , not limited to films . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Production began on June 28 , 2010 . On the same day , Marvel confirmed that Tommy Lee Jones had been cast to play US Army Colonel Chester Phillips . The next day Marvel confirmed that Dominic Cooper would portray the younger version of Howard Stark , the character played by John Slattery in Iron Man 2 . It was announced that the film would shoot in London in late July and was expected to include scenes featuring key London landmarks . War scenes were filmed in September at the former Royal Navy Propellant Factory in the Welsh village of Caerwent . Filming was scheduled to take place that month in the Northern Quarter of Manchester , where parts of the 2004 film Alfie and the 2009 Sherlock Holmes had been shot , followed by the Stanley Dock area of Liverpool , both doubling for the period 's Lower East Side of Manhattan . Further scenes were scheduled to be shot in Liverpool 's Albert Dock . Johnston included a scene of a technology fair that includes in passing a display case containing the 1940s android superhero known as the original Human Torch , another character , like Captain America , in comics published by Marvel Comics ' predecessor , Timely Comics .

 In November 2010 , Stanley Tucci stated that he had completed filming his scenes and that the rest of the production would wrap in about three weeks . In February 2011 , it was announced that Alan Silvestri had been chosen to compose the film score . In March 2011 , CraveOnline reported that Captain America : The First Avenger would be undergoing reshoots in the United Kingdom and in Los Angeles in April 2011 . A scene was also filmed in New York City 's Times Square on April 23 , 2011 . 
 The film features nearly 1 @,@ 600 visual effects shots , which were split between thirteen different companies . To achieve the appearance of the skinny , pre @-@ serum Steve Rogers , director Joe Johnston stated that he used two major techniques : 
 Most of the shots were done by an L.A. company called LOLA that specializes in digital " plastic surgery . " The technique involved shrinking Chris in all dimensions . We shot each skinny Steve scene at least four times ; once like a normal scene with Chris and his fellow actors in the scene , once with Chris alone in front of a green screen so his element could be reduced digitally , again with everyone in the scene but with Chris absent so that the shrunken Steve could be re @-@ inserted into the scene , and finally with a body double mimicking Chris 's actions in case the second technique were required . When Chris had to interact with other characters in the scene , we had to either lower Chris or raise the other actors on apple boxes or elevated walkways to make skinny Steve shorter in comparison . For close @-@ ups , Chris ' fellow actors had to look at marks on his chin that represented where his eyes would be after the shrinking process , and Chris had to look at marks on the tops of the actor 's head to represent their eyes . ... The second technique involved grafting Chris 's head onto the body double . This technique was used mostly when Chris was sitting or lying down , or when a minimum of physical acting was required .... 
 Captain America 's shield , which serves as both a defensive tool and a weapon , came in four types : metal , fiberglass , rubber , and computer graphics ( CG ) . Prop master Barry Gibbs specified that " We had the ' hero shield , ' which was made of aluminum , for our beauty shots [ and ] close @-@ up work . We then created a lighter shield that was aluminum @-@ faced with a fiberglass back , for use on a daily basis . ... And then we had a stunt shield made of polyurethane , which is sort of a synthetic rubber ... and we made an <unk> one we put on [ Evans ' ] back , so that if there were an accident , it wouldn 't hurt him . " Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said Evans " would practice swinging the practical shield so he knew the arc and the speed at which he should move . We would take the shield from him and shoot the scene with him miming it . Then we would add in a CG shield " . 
 Hugo Weaving , who portrayed the Red Skull , wore a latex mask conceived by prosthetic makeup designer David White . The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably , as the mask was bulky and they wanted to make it look like tight skin wrapped around a very bony structure . They thinned out Weaving 's cheeks and lower lip , hollowed out his eyes , and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character . 
 Closing credits were created by visual effects firm Rok ! t by means of 3 @-@ D and stereoscopic processing that used iconic American war propaganda , such as James Montgomery Flagg 's Uncle Sam recruitment poster from World War I and J. Howard Miller 's " We Can Do It ! " poster from World War II .

 The world premiere of Captain America : The First Avenger was held on July 19 , 2011 , at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood , California . The film was screened at the San Diego Comic @-@ Con International on July 21 , 2011 . It was commercially released in the United States and Canada on July 22 , 2011 . 
 Paramount opted against altering the American @-@ centric title when distributing to foreign territories , instead offering international markets a choice between the official title and the alternative The First Avenger . Many international distributors chose to retain the original title , believing the franchise name to be more identifiable than the alternative , and that the latter would risk losing ticket sales . Three countries chose the alternative title : Russia , South Korea , and Ukraine . An " insider " speaking to The New York Times explained that the name change in these countries stemmed from cultural and political concerns , though Marvel and Paramount both declined to state an official reason . In July 2011 , it was thought that the film would not be released in China because of a policy limiting the number of foreign films screened there each year , but it eventually opened there in the second weekend of September . 
 Days before the film 's release , a teaser trailer for The Avengers that served as a post @-@ credits scene of Captain America : The First Avenger was briefly leaked online .

 = Carcinus maenas = 
 " Shore crab " redirects here . This may also be used for crabs in the superfamily <unk> . 
 Carcinus maenas is a common littoral crab , and a widespread invasive species , listed among the 100 " world 's worst alien invasive species " . It is native to the north @-@ east Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea , but has colonised similar habitats in Australia , South Africa , South America and both Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America . It grows to a carapace width of 90 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) , and feeds on a variety of molluscs , worms and small crustaceans , potentially impacting a number of fisheries . Its successful dispersion has occurred via a variety of mechanisms , such as on ships ' hulls , packing materials , and bivalves moved for aquaculture . 
 C. maenas is known by different names around the world . In the British Isles , it is generally referred to as the shore crab , or green shore crab . In North America and South Africa , it bears the name green crab or European green crab . In Australia and New Zealand , it is referred to as either the European green crab or European shore crab . 
 = = Description = = 
 C. maenas has a carapace up to 60 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) long and 90 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) wide , but can be larger outside its native range , reaching 101 mm ( 4 @.@ 0 in ) wide in British Columbia . The carapace has five short teeth along the rim behind each eye , and three undulations between the eyes . The undulations , which protrude beyond the eyes , are the simplest means of distinguishing C. maenas from the closely related C. aestuarii , which can also be an invasive species . In C. aestuarii , the carapace lacks any bumps and extends forward beyond the eyes . Another characteristic for distinguishing the two species is the form of the first and second pleopods ( collectively the gonopods ) , which are straight and parallel in C. aestuarii , but curve outwards in C. maenas . 
 The colour of C. maenas varies greatly , from green to brown , grey or red . This variation has a genetic component , but is largely due to local environmental factors . In particular , individuals which delay moulting become red – coloured rather than green . Red individuals are stronger and more aggressive , but are less tolerant of environmental stresses , such as low salinity or hypoxia . Juvenile crabs on average display greater patterning than adults . 
 = = Native and introduced range = = 
 C. maenas is native to European and North African coasts as far as the Baltic Sea in the east , and Iceland and Central Norway in the north , and is one of the most common crabs throughout much of its range . In the Mediterranean Sea , it is replaced by the closely related species Carcinus aestuarii . 
 C. maenas was first observed on the east coast of North America in Massachusetts in 1817 , and may now be found from South Carolina northwards ; by 2007 , this species had extended its range northwards to Placentia Bay , Newfoundland . In 1989 , the species was found in San Francisco Bay , California , on the Pacific coast of the United States . Until 1993 , it was not able to extend its range , but reached Oregon in 1997 , the state of Washington in 1998 and British Columbia in 1999 , thus extending its range by 750 kilometres ( 470 mi ) in ten years . By 2003 , C. maenas had extended to South America with specimens discovered in Patagonia . 
 In Australia , C. maenas was first reported " in the late 1800s " in Port Phillip Bay , Victoria , although the species was probably introduced as early as the 1850s . It has since spread along the south @-@ eastern and south @-@ western <unk> , reaching New South Wales in 1971 , South Australia in 1976 and Tasmania in 1993 . One specimen was found in Western Australia in 1965 , but there have been no further discoveries in the area since . 
 C. maenas first reached South Africa in 1983 , in the Table Docks area near Cape Town . Since then , it has spread at least as far as Saldanha Bay in the north and Camps Bay in the south , over 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) apart . 
 There have been appearances of C. maenas recorded in Brazil , Panama , Hawaii , Madagascar , the Red Sea , Pakistan , Sri Lanka and Myanmar ; however , these have not resulted in invasions , but remain isolated findings . Japan has been invaded by a related crab , either C. aestuarii or a hybrid of C. aestuarii and C. maenas . 
 It is believed , based on the ecological conditions , that C. maenas could eventually extend its range to colonise the Pacific coast of North America from Baja California to Alaska . Similar ecological conditions are to be found on many of the world 's coasts , with the only large potential area not to have been invaded yet being New Zealand ; the New Zealand government has taken action , including the release of a Marine Pest Guide in an effort to prevent colonisation by C. maenas . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 C. maenas can live in all types of protected and semi @-@ protected marine and estuarine habitats , including habitats with mud , sand , or rock substrates , submerged aquatic vegetation , and emergent marsh , although soft bottoms are preferred . C. maenas is euryhaline , meaning that it can tolerate a wide range of salinities ( from 4 to 52 ‰ ) , and survive in temperatures of 0 to 30 ° C ( 32 to 86 ° F ) . The wide salinity range allows C. maenas to survive in the lower salinities found in estuaries , and the wide temperature range allows it to survive in extremely cold climates beneath the ice in Winter . A molecular biological study using the COI gene found genetic differentiation between the North Sea and the Bay of Biscay , and even more strongly between the populations in Iceland and the Faroe Islands and those elsewhere . This suggests that C. maenas is unable to cross deeper water . 
 Females can produce up to 185 @,@ 000 eggs , and larvae develop offshore in several stages before their final moult to juvenile crabs in the intertidal zone . Young crabs live among seaweeds and seagrasses , such as Posidonia oceanica , until they reach adulthood . 
 C. maenas has the ability to disperse by a variety of mechanisms , including ballast water , ships ' hulls , packing materials ( seaweeds ) used to ship live marine organisms , bivalves moved for aquaculture , rafting , migration of crab larvae on ocean currents , and the movement of submerged aquatic vegetation for coastal zone management initiatives . Thresher et al. found C. maenas dispersed in Australia mainly by rare long @-@ distance events , possibly caused by human actions . 
 C. maenas is a predator , feeding on many organisms , particularly bivalve molluscs ( such as clams , oysters , and mussels ) , polychaetes and small crustaceans . They are primarily nocturnal , although activity also depends on the tide , and crabs can be active at any time of day . In California , preferential predation of C. maenas on native clams ( <unk> spp . ) resulted in the decline of the native clams and an increase of a previously introduced clam ( the amethyst gem clam , Gemma gemma ) . C. maenas has been implicated in the destruction of the soft @-@ shell clam ( Mya arenaria ) fisheries on the east coast of the United States and Canada , and the reduction of populations of other commercially important bivalves ( such as scallops , <unk> <unk> , and northern <unk> , Mercenaria mercenaria ) . The prey of C. maenas includes the young of bivalves and fish , although the effect of its predation on winter flounder , <unk> americanus is minimal . C. maenas can , however , have substantial negative impacts on local commercial and recreational fisheries , by preying on the young of species , such as oysters and the Dungeness crab , or competing with them for resources . 
 = = Control = = 
 Due to its potentially harmful effects on ecosystems , various efforts have been made to control introduced populations of C. maenas around the world . In Edgartown , Massachusetts , a bounty was levied in 1995 for catching C. maenas , to protect local shellfish , and 10 tons were caught . 
 There is evidence that the native blue crab in eastern North America , Callinectes sapidus , is able to control populations of C. maenas ; numbers of the two species are negatively correlated , and C. maenas is not found in the Chesapeake Bay , where Callinectes sapidus is most frequent . On the west coast of North America , C. maenas appears to be limited to upper estuarine habitats , in part because of predation by native rock crabs ( <unk> <unk> and Cancer productus ) and competition for shelter with a native shore crab , Hemigrapsus oregonensis . Host specificity testing has recently been conducted on Sacculina <unk> , a parasitic barnacle , as a potential biological control agent of C. maenas . In the laboratory , Sacculina settled on , infected , and killed native California crabs , including the Dungeness crab , Metacarcinus magister ( formerly Cancer magister ) , and the shore crabs Hemigrapsus <unk> , Hemigrapsus oregonensis and <unk> crassipes . Dungeness crabs were the most vulnerable of the tested native species to settlement and infection by the parasite . Although Sacculina did not mature in any of the native crabs , developing reproductive sacs were observed inside a few Metacarcinus magister and Hemigrapsus oregonensis . Any potential benefits of using Sacculina to control C. maenas on the west coast of North America would need to be weighed against these potential non @-@ target impacts .

 C. maenas is fished on a small scale in the north @-@ east Atlantic Ocean , with approximately 1200 tonnes being caught annually , mostly in France and the United Kingdom .

 Carcinus maenas was first given a binomial name , Cancer maenas , by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae . An earlier description was published by Georg Eberhard Rumphius in his 1705 work De <unk> <unk> , calling the species Cancer marinus sulcatus , but this predates the starting point for zoological nomenclature . A number of later synonyms have also been published : 
 <unk> taurus <unk> , 1778 
 Cancer <unk> Herbst , 1783 
 Cancer viridis Herbst , 1783 
 Cancer pygmaeus Fabricius , 1787

 Portunus <unk> Rafinesque @-@ Schmaltz , 1817

 The lectotype chosen for the species came from Marstrand , Sweden , but it is assumed to have been lost . In 1814 , writing for The Edinburgh Encyclopaedia , William Elford Leach erected a new genus , Carcinus to hold this species alone ( making it the type species of the genus , by <unk> ) . In 1847 , Nardo described a distinct subspecies occurring in the Mediterranean Sea , which is now recognised as a distinct species , Carcinus aestuarii . 
 = Pete Muldoon = 
 Linton Muldoon Treacy ( June 4 , 1887 – March 13 , 1929 ) , better known as Pete Muldoon , was a Canadian ice hockey coach and pioneer in the western United States , particularly known for bringing a Stanley Cup championship to Seattle , Washington . He is best known for reportedly putting a curse on the Chicago Black Hawks , as well as team owner Major Frederic McLaughlin , after he was fired at the end of the 1926 @-@ 27 season ; however , it has been alleged that a Toronto sportswriter had come up with the " curse " due to a bout of writer 's block in 1943 . Muldoon was the Black Hawks ' first head coach . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Muldoon was born in St. Marys , Ontario , as Linton Muldoon Treacy . He played hockey in the OHA in the 1900s before moving to the Pacific coast in order to pursue a boxing career . He changed his name to Pete Muldoon because the pursuit of a professional sports career was discouraged in Ontario at the time . Muldoon won regional titles in both the middleweight and light heavyweight divisions while boxing . 
 = = Ice hockey career = = 
 Muldoon was accomplished at other sports , including lacrosse . He played professionally for a Vancouver club in 1911 . He was also an ice dancer who was able to skate , as well as play hockey , while on stilts . In 1914 , he took over as the coach and manager of the Portland Rosebuds . For the 1915 season , he changed teams , and went to Seattle to manage a new team in the PCHA , the Metropolitans . He spent eight seasons coaching in Seattle , and amassed a record of 115 wins , 105 losses , and four ties . The Metropolitans competed several times for the Stanley Cup . The Mets played for the Stanley Cup three times under his leadership , and winning it once in 1917 during their first trip . Muldoon was the first and , at age 30 , youngest coach of a Stanley Cup Championship team based in the United States . 
 In 1919 , the Metropolitans made it to the finals for the second time in three years , this time against the Montreal Canadiens . The series was to have been a five @-@ game series , but the fourth game ended in a scoreless draw . However , local health officials called off the deciding sixth game just hours before it was due to start when several players on both teams were stricken by Spanish flu . With virtually his entire team either hospitalized or confined to bed and efforts to find replacements vetoed by the PCHA , Canadiens owner George Kennedy announced he was forfeiting the <unk> the <unk> Seattle . However , Muldoon felt it would be unsportsmanlike to accept what would have been his second Cup , seeing as it would have been at the expense of a team decimated by illness . Seattle lost in the Stanley Cup finals in the next year against the Ottawa Senators . 
 Muldoon returned to the Rosebuds after the Metropolitans folded in the spring of 1924 . He followed most of his players to the NHL when most of the Rosebuds were sold to Major Frederic McLaughlin to start the Chicago Black Hawks . He accepted the position because his wife Dorothy was a Chicago native and pregnant with the family 's second child . After the Black Hawks ended the 1926 – 27 season with a playoff berth after finishing in third place in the American Division with a 19 – 22 – 3 record , he resigned because of constant meddling from McLaughlin . 
 Muldoon returned to Seattle and became involved in efforts to bring a professional team back to the city , as a new arena was constructed in 1928 . Muldoon , with the help of a group of investors , established the Seattle Ice Skating and Hockey Association , while aiding to establish the <unk> . This new league had its first season in 1928 , and the Seattle team was dubbed the Seattle Eskimos . 
 = = = Curse of Muldoon = = = 
 According to a longstanding NHL legend , McLaughlin felt the Blackhawks should have won the American Division in their first season , and fired Muldoon when he disagreed . Muldoon was then reported to have placed an Irish curse on the Hawks that would keep them out of first place forever . As it turned out , the Hawks would not finish first , in any format , until 1966 @-@ <unk> 41st year in the league . It is unknown if Muldoon ever actually cursed the team , as it has been alleged that it was a hoax by a Toronto <unk> , yet other sources maintain that " 41 years is plenty long enough for any " curse , " real or imagined " .

 In the spring of 1929 , Muldoon went to Tacoma with co @-@ owner and local boxing promoter Nate <unk> to search for a location to build a new rink in order to establish a team . While in Tacoma , on March 13 , 1929 , Muldoon died due to a heart attack . Without their coach , the Seattle Eskimos were able to win a playoff series against Portland , before losing to Vancouver in the league finals . The following season the Eskimos established the Pete Muldoon Trophy , presented to the player " deemed most inspirational by his teammates " . It was awarded for a few seasons , and disappeared from records during the Great Depression years .

 = Living in the Material World ( song ) = 
 " Living in the Material World " is a song by English musician George Harrison , released as the title track to his 1973 solo album . In the song 's lyrics , Harrison presents a contrast between the world of material things and his spiritual goals , and the conflicting themes are represented in the musical arrangement , via juxtaposing sections in the rock genre and an Indian music setting . Inspired by Gaudiya Vaishnava teacher A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada , the song promotes the need to recognise the illusory nature of human existence and escape the constant cycle of reincarnation , and thereby attain moksha in the Hindu faith . The contrasts presented in " Living in the Material World " inspired both a photograph by Ken Marcus that appeared inside the album 's gatefold cover , and designer Tom Wilkes 's incorporation of Krishna @-@ related symbolism elsewhere in the packaging . 
 Harrison references his Beatles past as one of the trappings of the material world and refers by name to former bandmates John Lennon , Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr . The latter played drums on the track , recording for which took place in England between October 1972 and February 1973 , while the other contributing musicians include Jim Horn , Gary Wright and Jim Keltner . In a production that is highly regarded by some commentators , the rock portions of " Living in the Material World " include a slide guitar solo by Harrison , saxophone , two drummers and prominent Hammond organ , whereas the meditative Indian interludes feature flute , Zakir Hussain on tabla , and a rare post @-@ Beatle sitar performance by Harrison . Amid the favourable critical reception to the song on release , Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone termed it " an incantatory , polyrhythmic rocker with a falsetto @-@ on @-@ sitar refrain " . 
 In addition to providing the title for the Living in the Material World album , the song inspired Harrison 's choice for a name for his charity , the Material World Charitable Foundation , to which he donated his publishing royalties from the composition . The 2006 reissue of the album includes a film clip of " Living in the Material World " , featuring archival footage of the vinyl LP 's manufacturing process . Film @-@ maker Martin Scorsese used the song 's title for that of his 2011 documentary on the life of George Harrison . 
 = = Background = = 
 In his 1980 autobiography , I , Me , Mine , George Harrison credits the influence for his song " Living in the Material World " to A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada , founder and leader of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness ( ISKCON ) , commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement . Harrison adds that the song specifically espouses the message that " we are not these bodies , we are in these material bodies in the physical world . " His friend Ravi Shankar once observed that Harrison exhibited <unk> , a trait meaning non @-@ attachment or renunciation , a point to which Shankar added : " He had everything – all the wealth , the fame , whatever he wanted . But he was not attached to it ... because he was searching for something much higher , much deeper . It does seem like he already had some Indian background in him [ from a previous life ] . " Harrison later said of life in the material world , referring to the need to break the cycle of rebirth associated with reincarnation : " The whole point to being here , really , is to figure a way to get out .

 Author Gary Tillery draws parallels between Harrison 's approach to " [ going ] through the motions of living in the material world " and the way someone in the 21st century might play a virtual reality game . Tillery writes that " what we see and experience during the game is actually an illusion " – or maya in the Hindu belief to which Harrison subscribed – and that " [ w ] hat does matter in the great scheme of things is to wake up from the dreamlike state we mistake for reality . " Speaking at a 1974 press conference , in reply to whether there was a " paradox " between his spiritualism and the lifestyle of a musician , Harrison conceded : " It is difficult ... You can go to the Himalayas and miss it completely and [ yet ] be stuck in the middle of New York and be very spiritual ... I think one by one we all free ourselves from the chains that we have chained ourselves to , whatever we 're chained to . "

 As reproduced in I , Me , Mine , Harrison wrote the lyrics to " Living in the Material World " on portions of a torn @-@ up envelope , which was previously addressed to Terry Doran at Apple Corps in central London , its postmark dated 7 November 1971 . The song contrasts the world of material things against spiritual concerns . The verses describing the material world are set to rock music , over what Harrison biographer Simon Leng terms " George 's favourite ' Get Back ' rhythm " . The two sections describing the spiritual world – serving as the song 's middle eights – use a more gentle melody backed by Indian instrumentation and so recall Harrison 's 1967 composition " Within You Without You " , in Leng 's view . While admiring how other Harrison lyrics from this period " resembled Vedic sutras " , author Joshua Greene writes that in " Living in the Material World " he " condensed a lengthy passage from the Bhagavad Gita into a dozen simple words " . 
 In the song 's opening verse , Harrison admits that he " Can 't say what I 'm doing here " in the material world , a statement that theologian Dale Allison identifies as Kafkaesque until Harrison offers " eschatological hope " with the subsequent line , " But I hope to see much clearer " . Harrison then states that he uses his body " like a car / Taking me both near and far " . Author Ian Inglis regards this as an apt metaphor , since our bodies " are merely the vehicles that carry us on our journeys " . 
 Harrison refers to his years as a member of the Beatles , naming former bandmates John Lennon , Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr in a verse that commentators recognise for its humorous content : 
 Met them all here in the material world 
 John and Paul here in the material world 
 Though we started out quite poor 
 We got Richie on a tour . 
 Inglis comments on Harrison 's pun on the word " Richie " , which can refer to the Beatles ' financial success from 1963 onwards , on one hand , and to the improvements in musicianship brought about by the arrival of drummer Richard Starkey , also known as Ringo Starr , when he replaced Pete Best in late 1962 . While noting Harrison 's " laconic humour " in the song , Leng describes him as " still caught in the yin @-@ yang of his Beatles identity " , further to the various " instalments of ' the Beatles soap opera ' " Harrison provided on his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass . 
 In the Indian @-@ styled middle eight , Harrison sings about his " sweet memories " of " the spiritual sky " and prays not to " get lost or go astray " . Allison writes that Harrison 's " true home " is here in the <unk> spiritual sky , since " however grand and glorious " his achievements with the Beatles might be to others , they brought him no " meaningful contentment " . 
 After returning to the rock @-@ music setting , Harrison sings of his frustrations in the material world , which rather than satisfying human desires , merely leaves the senses " swelling like a tide " . Tillery writes of Harrison not being immune to " the siren call of the world " despite his spiritual goals , and Harrison would refer to the years 1973 – 74 as " the naughty period " , a reaction to the failure of his marriage to Pattie Boyd . 
 In line with teachings that Harrison had absorbed from both Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1967 and the Bhagavad Gita , Allison suggests , the lines " Got a lot of work to do / Try to get a message through " demonstrate " a sort of prophetic self @-@ conception " on the singer 's part . In the final verse , Harrison expresses his desire for moksha , or release from the cycle of reincarnation , with the words : " I hope to get out of this place / By the Lord Sri Krsna 's Grace . " 
 Inglis writes that " Living in the Material World " contrasts not only the physical with the spiritual , but also a number of other issues for Harrison , including " past and present , West and East , noise and calm " . Leng notes the irony in the fact that although Harrison 's experience with the Beatles " cast him into the material world " , his exposure to Eastern philosophy came through that same experience , and thus the Beatles were " both his nemesis and his saviors " . 
 While citing the Bhagavad Gita as a significant influence on " Living in the Material World " , Allison views the " dualistic anthropology " expressed in the song as " central to [ Harrison 's ] self @-@ conception and worldview " . Harrison himself attributed this dualism to his Pisces astrological sign , an issue he addresses in the posthumously released " Pisces Fish " . He acknowledged in one interview : " I am an extreme person ... I was always extremely up or extremely down , extremely spiritual or extremely drugged . " 
 = = Production = = 
 Harrison began recording his long @-@ awaited follow @-@ up to All Things Must Pass in October 1972 , having been sidetracked with issues relating to the Concert for Bangladesh for over a year . The Magic Is Here Again and The Light That Has Lighted the World were each rumoured to be the new album 's title until Apple Records announced it as Living in the Material World . Inglis views " Living in the Material World " as an ideal title track for the album , given " the internal dialogue in which he was engaging at the time " . Leng describes Harrison as " a man positively pregnant with vision " following the " overwhelming success " of his solo career since the Beatles ' break @-@ up , and suggests that a visit he made to India with American musician Gary Wright in early 1972 was a contributing factor . 
 = = = Initial recording = = = 
 Keen to pare down the production after the Wall of Sound excesses employed by Phil Spector on All Things Must Pass , Harrison used a small group of backing musicians throughout the sessions . Aside from himself on electric guitar , the line @-@ up on the basic track for " Living in the Material World " was Nicky Hopkins ( piano ) , Wright ( Hammond organ ) , Klaus Voormann ( bass ) and Starr and Jim Keltner ( both on drums ) . Inglis describes the music as " a powerful rock backing " , while Leng views " Living in the Material World " as " the one time in his career that Harrison deliberately set out to create a big , showpiece rock number " . 
 The recording took place at the Beatles ' Apple Studio , according to the album 's sleeve credits , although Voormann maintains that Harrison 's new home studio , FPSHOT , was the main location . Harrison had intended to co @-@ produce with Spector as before , but he became the album 's sole producer due to Spector 's unreliability . Session tapes , since made available unofficially on the Living in the Alternate World bootleg , reveal that the rock instrumentation on " Living in the Material World " continued , at a reduced volume , over the " spiritual sky " portions originally . 
 With Phil McDonald as recording engineer , the basic tracks for most of the album were completed by December 1972 , before Hopkins departed for Jamaica to work on the Rolling Stones ' new album , Goats Head Soup ( 1973 ) . Harrison , McDonald and Indian tabla player Zakir Hussain then produced the recording of a recent New York performance by Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan , released on Apple Records in January 1973 as the double live album In Concert 1972 . 
 = = = Overdubbing = = = 
 Work resumed on Living in the Material World over January and February , with Hussain and Jim Horn among those making contributions to the overdubs on the title track . Over the two " spiritual sky " sections , Hussain added tabla , replacing the rock rhythm section , while Horn played flute and Harrison played sitar . Author Alan Clayson likens Harrison 's production style on Material World to that of Beatles producer George Martin and notes that " this moderation resulted in arrangements flexible enough for the title track to flit smoothly " between the contrasting rock and " celestial " Indian sections . The use of Indian instrumentation recalls Harrison 's work with the Beatles during 1966 – 68 , following which , Harrison admitted , he rarely played the sitar . Adding to the pun behind the " Richie " line in the verse referencing the Beatles , Starr provides a drum fill ; later in the track , Horn 's flute similarly acknowledges the mention of Krishna – flute being synonymous with Krishna in the Hindu faith . 
 For the solos on " Living in the Material World " , Harrison and Horn overdubbed slide guitar and tenor saxophone , respectively . Leng likens Harrison 's soloing to the " passionate , rocking slide guitar " he supplied on " Edward " for Hopkins 's The Tin Man Was a Dreamer album , also recorded at Apple in late 1972 . The recording ends with what Clayson terms " a syncopated blues run @-@ down " , emphasising the song 's " big production " status . 
 = = Release and album artwork = = 
 Apple Records released Living in the Material World at the end of May 1973 , with the title track sequenced to end side one in the original , LP format . " Living in the Material World " followed another Harrison composition reflecting on his years with the Beatles , " Who Can See It " . In keeping with the album content , Tom Wilkes 's design for the record 's face labels contrasted a devout spiritual existence with life in the material world , by featuring a painting of Krishna and his warrior prince Arjuna on side one and a picture of a Mercedes stretch limousine on the reverse . The painting of Krishna and Arjuna came from a version of the Bhagavad Gita published by Prabhupada . 
 Author Elliot Huntley views Living in the Material World as a concept album on which the material – spiritual " quandary " evident in the title track is " eloquently expressed " through the artwork 's mix of religious symbolism and an inner @-@ gatefold photograph that showed " [ Harrison 's ] band indulging in a gratuitously sumptuous feast " . The stretch @-@ limousine image was a detail taken from this photo , the concept for which reflected Harrison 's view that the material world is not only related to money and possessions , but to " everything which is gross , physical , or material as opposed to the subtle , astral or casual " , as he puts it in I , Me , Mine when discussing the song . NME critic Bob Woffinden also commented on the symbolism of this picture showing " Harrison with his musicians ( Nicky Hopkins , Klaus Voormann , Jim Keltner , Ringo – the usual lot ) enjoying a hearty repast , passing the no @-@ doubt vintage wine , while in the background the longest limousine in the world awaits their convenience " . 
 A parody of da Vinci 's The Last Supper , the picture was taken by Hollywood glamour photographer Ken Marcus . Clayson has speculated on the symbolism and hidden messages within the photo : whether the nurse with a pram , set back from and to the left of the dining table , was a reference to Boyd 's inability to conceive a child ; and the empty , distant wheelchair in memory of Harrison 's late mother . Allison finds evidence of Harrison 's antipathy towards organised religion in this inner @-@ gatefold photo , following on from the lyrics to his 1970 song " Awaiting on You All " . In order to add to Harrison 's " mystique " , author Bruce Spizer writes , Wilkes placed a colour image of him over the main , black @-@ and @-@ white print . The same detail echoed the contrast in " Living in the Material World " between the illusory nature of human existence and what Allison describes as the " vital , eternal reality " offered by spiritual enlightenment . 
 The song also provided the inspiration for the title of Harrison 's charity , the Material World Charitable Foundation , launched in April 1973 . Harrison donated the copyright to " Living in the Material World " and eight other tracks on the album to the foundation , one of the stated aims of which was " to encourage the exploration of alternative life views and philosophies " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In his album review for Rolling Stone , Stephen Holden wrote of Harrison having " inherited the most precious Beatle legacy – the spiritual aura that the group accumulated " and suggested that he had " maintained its inviolability with remarkable grace " . Holden described " Living in the Material World " as " an incantatory , polyrhythmic rocker with a falsetto @-@ on @-@ sitar refrain " and viewed the music as " some of the most complex on the album " . Billboard magazine listed the song first among the " best cuts " on a collection whose themes included " the Beatles and their mish @-@ mash " and a " spiritual undercoat " . In Melody Maker , Michael Watts described " Living in the Material World " as " brilliant " and suggested that it might have made a superior lead single to " Give Me Love ( Give Me Peace on Earth ) " . In his 1981 book The Beatles Apart , Bob Woffinden wrote admiringly of Harrison " grappling with the problem " of " striving for spiritual goals when you 're a young and famous multi @-@ millionaire " . Woffinden dismissed the title track as a " flop " , however , citing Harrison 's failed attempts " to <unk> the syllables of ' material ' " with the melody . 
 More recently , AllMusic critic Lindsay Planer has described " Living in the Material World " as " one of the more profound observations to be made about the somewhat schizophrenic struggle between universal existence and monetary @-@ driven survival " . Planer praises the recording as " a testament to the artist 's ability to deliver the goods [ as a guitarist ] , with searing albeit brief interaction with saxophonist Jim Horn " and similarly compliments the playing of Starr and Hopkins . While opining that Material World " suffers from a more anonymous tract " next to All Things Must Pass , Zeth Lundy of PopMatters pairs " Living in the Material World " with " The Lord Loves the One ( That Loves the Lord ) " as the album 's " most uptempo rock songs " , which " fare much better [ than some of the ballads ] as eager bids for secession from this life , or at least from the clutches of its material concerns " . 
 Writing in 2014 , Joe Marchese of The Second Disc highlights " Living in the Material World " among tracks that combine to form the album 's " earnest and intensely personal , yet wholly accessible , statement " . While describing Material World as " meticulously produced " , Blogcritics writer Chaz Lipp considers the " galloping title track " to be a song that " rank [ s ] right alongside Harrison 's best work " . In another 2014 review , for the Lexington Herald @-@ Leader , Walter Tunis includes the track among the " stunners " found on Material World , and labels it a " comparatively whimsical title tune " . 
 Among Beatles and Harrison biographers , Chip Madinger and Mark Easter describe " Living in the Material World " as " superb " and Robert Rodriguez views Harrison 's " deft blending of Western and Eastern sounds " as a " production marvel " . Although he admires the " vaguely Indian middle eight [ s ] " , Elliot Huntley bemoans the " complex , powerhouse arrangement " used elsewhere and finds Horn 's sax playing " a little overbearing " . Simon Leng calls " Living in the Material World " a " musical Roman Candle " , and a " highly effective track " that is " the work of a very confident musician " . Ian Inglis praises Harrison 's " inventive " lyrics , of which the " got Richie on a tour " line is " one of his cleverest puns " , and notes that the song 's positioning in the running order " echoes George Martin 's policy of always selecting a strong track to close each side of every Beatles album " .

 The song was remastered in 2006 for EMI 's reissue of Living in the Material World , five years after Harrison 's death . The final selection on the DVD accompanying this reissue featured " Living in the Material World " set to archival footage of the manufacturing process behind the album . The footage had been commissioned by Harrison in 1973 , and it includes an executive undertaking a test pressing , preparation of the face labels , vinyl cutting , and the album being hand @-@ packaged in EMI 's warehouse . During the first " spiritual sky " section , the film cuts to footage of Harrison raising a yellow and red Om flag on the roof of his Friar Park home – a demonstration he adopted in the early 1970s to reflect when he was living true to his spiritual goals . The clip ends with a <unk> still of Marcus 's inner gatefold photo . With production credited to Abbey Road Interactive , this film of " Living in the Material World " also appears on the DVD included in Harrison 's 2014 The Apple Years 1968 – 75 box set . 
 The song provided the title for Martin Scorsese 's 2011 documentary George Harrison : Living in the Material World and for Olivia Harrison 's book accompanying the film . During her interview in the documentary , Olivia discusses her late husband 's determination to " work out " all his karma in the one lifetime rather than have his soul return to earth in a new incarnation . Writing for The Huffington Post at the time of the film 's release , Religion News Service reporter Steve Rabey referred to " Living in the Material World " as a song that " illuminates [ Harrison 's ] theology and sense of artistic vocation " , and he said of the former Beatle : " his greatest legacy may be the way his decades @-@ long spiritual quest shaped the ways the West looks at God , gurus and life . " On Harrison 's official website , the Material World Charitable Foundation page continues to use " Living in the Material World " as its featured audio .

 Delaware Route 1 ( DE 1 ) is a 103 @.@ 02 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 165 @.@ 79 km ) state highway in the U.S. state of Delaware . The route runs from the Maryland border in Fenwick Island , Sussex County , where it continues into that state as Maryland Route 528 ( MD 528 ) , north to an interchange with DE 58 in Christiana , New Castle County , where the road continues north as DE 7 . Between Fenwick Island and Dover Air Force Base in Dover , Kent County , DE 1 is a four- to six @-@ lane surface divided highway with occasional interchanges . The route heads north past the Delaware Beaches along the Atlantic Ocean before it runs northwest through rural areas , turning north at Milford to continue to Dover . Upon reaching Dover , DE 1 becomes the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway , a four- to six @-@ lane freeway that is tolled . Between Dover and Tybouts Corner , DE 1 parallels U.S. Route 13 ( US 13 ) , crossing over and featuring interchanges with it multiple times . Past Tybouts Corner , the freeway heads north to Christiana , reaching an interchange with Interstate 95 ( I @-@ 95 ) a short distance before its terminus . 
 DE 1 was first designated in the 1970s between Fenwick Island and US 113 in Milford , replacing a portion of DE 14 and following the newly constructed Milford Bypass . DE 14 between Fenwick Island and Milford had been built as a state highway in the 1920s and 1930s and was widened into a divided highway between the 1950s and 1970s . In the 1980s , a limited @-@ access Relief Route for US 13 was proposed between Dover and the Wilmington area in order to relieve that route of beach traffic . This relief route would be incorporated into DE 1 in 1988 , with the route extended up US 113 between Milford and Dover to connect to the Relief Route . The tolled DE 1 freeway between Dover Air Force Base and Christiana opened in multiple stages between 1991 and 2003 , and at a cost of $ 900 million was the largest public works project in Delaware history . The concurrent US 113 designation north of Milford was removed in 2004 . Upgrades continue to be made to DE 1 such as the construction and improvement of interchanges as well as widening portions of the road .

 Along the Dover Air Force Base boundary , DE 1 transitions from a four @-@ lane divided surface road to a freeway called the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway , which is a toll road . The first interchange is a northbound exit and entrance which serves the commercial gate of Dover Air Force Base . The freeway passes between the air base golf course to the southwest and various base buildings to the northeast before it reaches a diamond interchange serving the main gate to the northeast and base housing to the southwest . After this , the route continues between base residences and the main part of the base prior to reaching a northbound exit and southbound entrance at the eastern terminus of DE 10 and Bay Road that also serves the north gate of Dover Air Force Base . DE 1 runs north along the west side of Bay Road before it passes over it , where there is a southbound exit and entrance and a northbound entrance that serves to provide access to DE 10 from southbound DE 1 and to northbound DE 1 . Immediately after this is a southbound exit and northbound entrance with the Puncheon Run Connector , which heads west towards US 13 .

 The portion of DE 1 between Milford and Little Heaven was initially built as part of the DuPont Highway , a highway that spanned the state from Selbyville to Wilmington . The highway was proposed as a modern road that was part of a philanthropic measure . This roadway was planned to improve travel and bring economic development to Kent and Sussex counties . The DuPont Highway was to be modeled after the great boulevards of Europe and was to have a 200 @-@ foot ( 61 m ) wide right @-@ of @-@ way consisting of a 40 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) wide roadway for automobiles flanked by dual trolley lines , 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) wide roadways for heavy vehicles , 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) wide unpaved roadways for horses , and sidewalks . Utilities were to be buried underground below the horse roadways . The highway was also to include agricultural experimental stations and monuments for future surveying . Trolley revenues would help pay for the construction of the roadway . After portions of the DuPont Highway were built , these portions were planned to be turned over to the state at no charge . 
 In 1911 , the Coleman DuPont Road , Inc. was established and construction on the highway began . By 1912 , construction was interrupted by litigation challenging both the constitutionality of the law establishing the road building corporation and the need for DuPont to acquire such a large right @-@ of @-@ way . DuPont would narrow the proposed right @-@ of @-@ way to 100 feet ( 30 m ) in order to compromise with opponents of the highway in addition to offering <unk> whose properties were affected by the highway five times the assessed value of the land five years after the highway was completed . The DuPont Highway would end up being built on a 60 @-@ foot ( 18 m ) alignment with a 32 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) wide roadway . The DuPont Highway north of Milford would be both designed and constructed by Delaware State Highway Department ( DSHD ) . A portion of the road north of Milford and from Frederica to Little Heaven were completed by 1920 . The portion of the DuPont Highway from north of Milford to Frederica was under construction in 1920 and completed by 1923 , the same year the last section of the entire Selbyville – Wilmington highway was completed near Odessa . When the U.S. Highway System was designated in 1926 , this portion of the DuPont Highway became a part of US 113 . 
 The portion of DE 1 between Little Heaven and Dover Air Force Base was built as part of a Dover bypass for US 113 . This bypass was built atop existing Bay Road north of the present @-@ day DE 9 interchange and on a new alignment south of there . The new highway between Little Heaven and Bay Road would cross the St. Jones River at a site called Barkers Landing . Between December 1931 and the end of 1933 , DSHD constructed a causeway across 3 @,@ 150 feet ( 960 m ) of the marsh on the east bank of the river , a process that required multiple applications of fill dirt and dynamite to create a stable surface for a modern highway . A Scherzer rolling lift bascule bridge was constructed across the St. Jones River in 1934 . Bay Road was widened and the new sections of highway were built with 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) wide concrete pavement starting in 1934 . US 113 was relocated to the bypass when the new highway opened for Memorial Day in 1935 . 
 US 113 was widened into a divided highway from north of Milford to south of Frederica and around Dover Air Force Base in 1959 . A four @-@ lane divided bypass to the east of Frederica was constructed in 1965 . US 113 between Frederica and Little Heaven was expanded in 1975 . US 113 between Little Heaven and Dover Air Force Base was expanded to a divided highway in 1984 and 1985 ; this project included replacing the two @-@ lane drawbridge over the St. Jones River with a four @-@ lane girder bridge . 
 What would become DE 1 between Milford and Rehoboth Beach was originally a county road by 1920 . By 1924 , the road was proposed as a state highway between Nassau and Rehoboth Beach . A year later , the state highway was completed between Milford and Cedar Creek and from Nassau to just west of Rehoboth Beach , with the sections between Cedar Creek and Nassau and into Rehoboth Beach under proposal . In 1927 , the state highway between Milford and Rehoboth Beach was completed with the construction of a bascule bridge over the Broadkill River . In 1931 , a state gravel road was extended from Bethany Beach to the Indian River Inlet , providing access to the inlet for recreational purposes . In January 1933 , bids were made for construction of a gravel road from Dewey Beach south to the Indian River Inlet as well as for a timber bridge across the inlet , connecting with the gravel road between the Indian River Inlet and Bethany Beach . This gravel road would provide a direct connection between Bethany Beach and Rehoboth Beach and would provide better access to the Atlantic coast for recreation . The Ocean Highway between Bethany Beach and Rehoboth Beach was completed in 1933 . In fall of that year , the roadway between Bethany Beach and Indian River Inlet was paved , with recommendations to pave the road north from the Indian River Inlet toward Rehoboth Beach . In 1934 , the Ocean Highway between the Indian River Inlet and Rehoboth Beach was paved . The same year , recommendations were made to extend the Ocean Highway south from Bethany Beach to Fenwick Island , where it would lead to a Maryland state highway continuing to Ocean City . 
 When Delaware designated its state highway system by 1936 , the state highway between Milford and Bethany Beach became a part of DE 14 , which continued west from Milford to the Maryland border near Burrsville , Maryland . In 1939 , a southern extension of DE 14 was built between Bethany Beach and the Maryland border in Fenwick Island as a gravel road . In 1940 , a swing bridge opened across the Indian River Inlet . The same year , work began for a bypass of the route between Dewey Beach and west of Rehoboth Beach , which included a bascule bridge over the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal . In 1942 , the Rehoboth Beach bypass for DE 14 was completed . In addition , the roadway was paved between Fenwick Island and Bethany Beach by that year . In 1952 , a new swing bridge opened across the Indian River Inlet after the previous bridge was destroyed by ice and tides in 1948 . 
 The route was widened into a divided highway between DE 18 ( now US 9 ) in Nassau and Rehoboth Beach in 1954 in order to provide relief to traffic heading to the beaches . Channelized intersections were built at DE 18 and the entrance to Rehoboth Beach . As part of this widening , DE 14 was moved to a new alignment to bypass <unk> Corner , removing a concurrency with DE 18 ( now US 9 Bus . ) . In 1965 , a new dual bridge was constructed across the Indian River Inlet . By 1966 , DE 14A was designated onto the former alignment of DE 14 through Rehoboth Beach . The divided highway portion of DE 14 was extended north to DE 16 , which included a bypass of Nassau , and between the Indian River Inlet and South Bethany in 1967 . By 1967 , a divided bypass of Milford running from DE 14 southeast of Milford to US 113 north of Milford was under proposal . Structural design on the Milford Bypass began in 1968 . In 1969 , design work began on widening DE 14 into a divided highway between DE 16 and the Milford Bypass . The route was widened into a divided highway between Dewey Beach and the Indian River Inlet the same year . In 1971 , the divided <unk> Bypass between DE 14 southeast of Milford and US 113 north of Milford was completed . In 1971 , a contract was awarded to widen DE 14 to a divided highway between Fenwick Island and South Bethany . This widening project was completed a year later . In 1973 , construction was underway to make DE 14 a divided highway from the Milford Bypass to DE 16 , which included a bypass of Argos Corner ; this was completed in 1974 . 
 In 1974 , DE 1 was signed concurrent with DE 14 east of Milford and on the Milford Bypass . Work began in 1975 to widen the portion of DE 14 bypassing Rehoboth Beach , which included a new bridge over the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal . In 1977 , DE 14 was truncated to Milford , with DE 1 replacing the route between Fenwick Island and the south end of the Milford Bypass . As a result of this , DE 14A was renumbered to DE 1A . A new high @-@ level bridge carrying DE 1 over the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal opened in 1978 . By 1981 , DE 1 was widened to a divided highway between Dewey Beach and southwest of Rehoboth Beach except for the crossing of the canal . In 1985 , the crossing over the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal was dualized with a high @-@ level bridge constructed for northbound traffic . DE 1 was designated along US 113 between Milford and Dover in 1988 . In 2004 , the concurrent US 113 designation along DE 1 between Milford and Dover Air Force Base was removed . On September 11 , 2006 , work began on a $ 9 @.@ 7 million project to widen DE 1 between DE 24 in Midway and US 9 in Five Points by adding a third southbound lane and a multi @-@ use lane in both directions . The project was completed on June 9 , 2008 . 
 In 2009 , work began to replace the steel @-@ girder Indian River Inlet Bridge with a cable @-@ stayed span due to scouring that had occurred to the steel girder bridge . The new Indian River Inlet Bridge opened to southbound traffic on January 20 , 2012 . Delaware Governor Jack Markell , U.S. Senator Tom Carper , and DelDOT Secretary Shailen Bhatt rode in the first car across the bridge . On January 30 , 2012 , one northbound lane of the new bridge opened . All four lanes of the bridge as well as the pedestrian and bicycle walkway opened in spring 2012 . Demolition of the 1965 bridge began in spring 2012 and was completed in spring 2013 . 
 In September 2014 , a $ 7 @.@ 2 million project began for pedestrian improvements to the stretch of DE 1 between the bridge over the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal in Rehoboth Beach and Nassau , which sees heavy pedestrian and bicycle traffic during the summer months . The project added a continuous sidewalk along this segment of road , multiple new crosswalks , and new and improved bus stops . The pedestrian improvement project was completed on June 13 , 2016 , with Governor Markell , DelDOT secretary Jennifer Cohan , State Representative Peter <unk> , and State Senator Ernesto Lopez in attendance at a ceremony to mark the completion of the project . 
 DelDOT has replaced several at @-@ grade intersections along DE 1 south of Dover with grade @-@ separated interchanges . The intersection with DE 9 near Dover Air Force Base was rebuilt into an interchange in 2009 . In November 2009 , construction began for a grade @-@ separated interchange with DE 12 in Frederica ; the interchange was completed in June 2011 . In November 2012 , construction began on an interchange at DE 30 southeast of Milford . The interchange between DE 1 and DE 30 was completed in July 2014 . On January 31 , 2015 , groundbreaking took place for an interchange at Thompsonville Road north of Milford , with Governor Markell and DelDOT secretary Bhatt in attendance . Completion of this interchange is expected by winter 2016 . On November 9 , 2015 , construction began on an interchange at Bowers Beach Road in Little Heaven , with Governor Markell , DelDOT secretary Cohan , U.S. Senators Carper and Chris Coons , and Speaker of the Delaware House of Representatives Peter <unk> in attendance at the groundbreaking ceremony . Work on the interchange at Bowers Beach Road will build service roads to the east and west of the current route with a bridge carrying DE 1 over Bowers Beach Road ; construction is expected to last until 2018 . On March 18 , 2016 , a groundbreaking ceremony took place to build an interchange at Frederica Road south of Frederica , with Governor Markell , Senator Carper , and Kent County Administrator Michael J. Petit de Mange present at the ceremony . Construction of this interchange is expected to be finished in mid @-@ 2018 . 
 There are plans to replace two more at @-@ grade intersections along the route with grade separated interchanges . The two intersections to be upgraded to interchanges are DE 14 in Milford and DE 16 east of Milton . Construction on the interchange at DE 14 in Milford is expected to begin in fall 2017 and be completed in 2019 . The proposed interchange at DE 16 is in the early design stage with construction not projected to begin until 2020 .

 Between 1958 and 1971 , studies were conducted for a bypass of the segment of US 13 through Dover along with a connector between Dover and Frederica . The proposed routing began at US 113 and DE 12 north of Frederica and continued northwest to Woodside , where it was planned to cross US 13 . From here , the bypass was to run to the west of Dover and head north to its terminus at US 13 north of Cheswold . As part of planning of the Dover Bypass , an archaeological survey had to be conducted along part of the proposed route between 1972 and 1975 . By 1976 , construction of the Dover Bypass was postponed indefinitely . From 1971 to 1978 , a north @-@ south extension of the Delaware Turnpike between Wilmington and Dover was studied . This extension was proposed to run from north of I @-@ 95 in Ogletown south to US 13 near Camden . The toll road would head south from Ogletown and cross the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal on the Summit Bridge to reach a connector to US 301 near the Maryland border . From here , the turnpike would bypass Middletown , Clayton , Smyrna , and Dover to the west before coming to US 13 . Intermediate interchanges were to be located west of Dover , at DE 6 west of Smyrna , west of Middletown , at DE 896 south of the Summit Bridge , DE 71 north of the Summit Bridge , US 40 , and I @-@ 95 . The north @-@ south extension of the Delaware Turnpike was to have a combination of ramp tolls and mainline toll barriers . Three mainline toll barriers were to be located between I @-@ 95 and US 40 , between Middletown and Smyrna , and north of Camden . The projected cost of the project in 1972 was $ 107 million . 
 In 1983 , studies began for a " Relief Route " of US 13 between Dover and Wilmington . The new highway was proposed in order to relieve US 13 of traffic heading to the Delaware Beaches in the summer . The Relief Route for US 13 was planned as a toll road in order to help pay for the cost of the construction of the highway . Prior to the beginning of construction , an archaeological survey was conducted along the proposed route of the freeway in 1986 . The same year , plans were unveiled for the route , which would begin at US 113 south of Dover and head north to US 13 in Tybouts Corner . The Relief Route would cross US 13 several times , passing to the east of Dover and Smyrna and to the west of Odessa . The section of DE 1 between Tybouts Corner and Christiana had originally been planned as relief route for DE 7 , a two @-@ lane road that connected US 13 to I @-@ 95 that saw a lot of congestion . 
 In July 1987 , construction began on the first segment of the freeway between US 40 in Bear and DE 273 in Christiana . In 1988 , the US 13 Relief Route was given the DE 1 designation . DE 1 was extended from its northern terminus in Milford to follow US 113 between Milford and Dover and US 13 between Dover and Tybouts Corner . Construction on the freeway between US 13 in Tybouts Corner and US 40 in Bear began in March 1988 . In August of that year , groundbreaking took place for the section of the DE 1 toll road between Dover and Smyrna . Construction commenced on DE 1 between DE 273 and I @-@ 95 in Christiana in August 1990 . The first section of the DE 1 freeway opened in August 1991 between US 13 in Tybouts Corner and US 40 in Bear . Three months later , the freeway opened north to DE 273 in Christiana . 
 In April 1992 , groundbreaking took place for the section of DE 1 across the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal . It was decided that the highway would cross the canal on a cable @-@ stayed bridge . The section of DE 1 between DE 273 and I @-@ 95 in Christiana opened in April 1993 . The section of the tollway between US 113 at Dover Air Force Base and US 13 north of Smyrna opened on December 21 , 1993 , with Governor Tom Carper in attendance at the opening ceremony . This section opened with a mainline toll barrier and ramp tolls . Following the completion of this section , DE 1 was rerouted off US 113 and US 13 between Dover and Smyrna . 
 When the portion of DE 1 between Dover and Smyrna opened , road signs , with the exception of speed limit signs , were in metric units in anticipation of the United States converting to the metric system . The section of DE 1 between Dover and Smyrna had exit numbers based on <unk> while the section between Tybouts Corner and Christiana originally had exit numbers based on mileposts . In 1997 , the exit numbers along the portion of the route between Tybouts Corner and Christiana were changed to reflect <unk> . 
 In December 1995 , the section of DE 1 between US 13 in St. Georges and US 13 in Tybouts Corner opened , which included the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Bridge . Prior to the opening of this section , a bridge walk was held over the canal . Following the completion of this segment , DE 1 was rerouted off the surface alignment of US 13 that crossed the St. Georges Bridge . Subsequently , US 13 was rerouted to follow the new DE 1 between the DE 72 interchange and Tybouts Corner . Construction of the new DE 1 had severed US 13 south of Tybouts Corner , with part of the former alignment north of the DE 7 intersection becoming a two @-@ lane road while the section south of there became an extended DE 7 to the intersection with US 13 and DE 72 . In building DE 1 across the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal , there were initially plans to demolish the aging St. Georges Bridge that carried US 13 over the canal . The plan drew concerns from residents in St. Georges who feared the community would be split in half . The St. Georges Bridge was instead kept and was refurbished . A southbound exit and northbound entrance at US 13 south of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Bridge along DE 1 was built as required by federal legislation that gave the state $ 115 million toward construction of the new canal bridge . 
 Construction of an interchange at the Dover Air Force Base main gate commenced in February 1996 . This project resulted in the relocation of the main gate further back in order to build the interchange and the overpass linking the main gate to base housing . This construction resulted in facilities having to be constructed at the north gate in order to be able to handle base traffic . In May of that year , groundbreaking took place for the DE 1 toll road between Odessa and St. Georges . The segment of DE 1 between US 13 south of Odessa and US 13 in St. Georges opened in November 1999 . DE 1 was subsequently rerouted off US 13 between those two points . 
 In March 2000 , groundbreaking took place for the final segment of the DE 1 freeway between Smyrna and Odessa . The interchange at the Dover Air Force Base main gate was completed in July of that year . The construction of the final segment resulted in a portion of US 13 south of Odessa being shifted further east as DE 1 would be built on top of the road . A service road would serve properties on the southbound side of US 13 . In October 2001 , northbound US 13 was realigned to the new alignment south of Odessa in order to build DE 1 in that area . In May 2002 , US 13 was shifted to a new southbound alignment south of Odessa , with the former portion of the route in that area becoming a service road known as Harris Road . On September 5 , 2002 , a partial interchange opened at DE 8 in Dover , utilizing existing emergency vehicle ramps . This interchange was included in the initial plans for the highway but was dropped due to low traffic volumes . As part of building the interchange , DelDOT purchased development rights to adjacent land parcels in order to prevent additional development in the area of the interchange . 
 On May 19 , 2003 , Governor Ruth Ann Minner cut the ribbon for the final section of the DE 1 toll road between US 13 north of Smyrna and US 13 south of Odessa . This section opened to traffic two days later . As a result , DE 1 was moved off US 13 between Smyrna and Odessa . The total cost to build the toll road was $ 900 million and it was the largest public works project in Delaware history . As part of building DE 1 , DelDOT created new wetlands to replace the ones that were lost in construction of the highway . As a result of the completion of the final section , the northbound exit and southbound entrance with US 13 south of Odessa was removed . 
 Traffic congestion at the cloverleaf interchange with I @-@ 95 in Christiana led to DelDOT to improve the interchange . The project included adding flyover connecting ramps from northbound DE 1 to northbound I @-@ 95 and from southbound I @-@ 95 to southbound DE 1 which allowed for easier merging patterns and the elimination of lengthy backups on the former ramp design . Construction of a new " ring access road " around Christiana Mall began in February 2011 and was completed in March 2012 , with a newly built bridge over DE 1 , just south of the I @-@ 95 interchange . The ramp from southbound I @-@ 95 to southbound DE 1 / DE 7 opened on August 27 , 2013 and the ramp from northbound DE 1 / DE 7 to northbound I @-@ 95 opened on October 17 , 2013 , with a ribbon cutting ceremony attended by Governor Markell and DelDOT secretary Bhatt . 
 DelDOT has plans to widen DE 1 by an additional lane in each direction between the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Bridge and the DE 273 interchange in Christiana . The project will involve widening bridges and reconfiguring interchanges . Construction is currently delayed due to funding issues . A project began on September 21 , 2015 to construct a northbound auxiliary lane between the US 40 and DE 273 interchanges in order to reduce congestion , which was completed shortly before Thanksgiving 2015 . On April 29 , 2016 , Governor Markell , DelDOT secretary Cohan , and local officials attended a groundbreaking ceremony for a $ 7 million project that will rebuild the DE 72 interchange into a diverging diamond interchange , the first such interchange in Delaware .

 Delaware Route 1A ( DE 1A ) is a state highway in Sussex County . The route runs 2 @.@ 92 mi ( 4 @.@ 70 km ) from DE 1 in Dewey Beach to another intersection with DE 1 west of Rehoboth Beach . The route provides access to Rehoboth Beach from DE 1 , heading north before turning to the west . DE 1A follows King Charles Avenue , Bayard Avenue , 2nd Street ( southbound ) , Christian Street ( northbound ) , and Rehoboth Avenue . 
 What is now DE 1A was originally a part of DE 14 between 1936 and 1942 . The road was designated DE 14A by 1966 . In the 1970s , DE 1A was designated along DE 14A for a few years before DE 14A was decommissioned in favor of DE 1A . Between 2002 and 2006 , a streetscape project revitalized the Rehoboth Avenue portion of the route and a roundabout was added at the entrance to Rehoboth Beach .

 Delaware Route 1B ( DE 1B ) is a 1 @.@ 11 miles ( 1 @.@ 79 km ) state highway spur of DE 1 that allows access to and from Rehoboth Beach . DE 1B starts at the southern approach to the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal bridge on DE 1 , with right @-@ in / right @-@ out ramps providing access to both directions of DE 1 . From this point , DE 1B heads west from DE 1 as a two @-@ lane undivided road , curving north and passing under the DE 1 bridge over the canal . The route intersects State Road , which provides access to and from the northbound lanes of DE 1 , at which point it heads northeast away from the canal on State Road . DE 1B continues into Rehoboth Beach and passes homes before reaching its terminus at DE 1A . At this intersection , left turns are prohibited from DE 1B to DE 1A northbound .

 Delaware Route 1D ( DE 1D ) is an auxiliary route of DE 1 in Sussex County . The route begins at DE 1 in Midway , where it heads southwest concurrent with DE 24 on four @-@ lane divided John J. Williams Highway . The road passes homes and businesses as it transitions into a three @-@ lane road with a center left @-@ turn lane . DE 1D splits from DE 24 by heading northwest onto two @-@ lane undivided Plantation Road concurrent with DE 24 Alt . The road heads through a mix of farmland and residential development . Upon reaching Five Points , the road curves southwest and comes to an intersection with DE 23 . At this point , DE 1D ends while the road continues southwest as DE 23 and DE 24 Alt . DE 23 heads north at this point to immediately intersect US 9 / DE 404 , which head east to provide access to DE 1 . DE 1D was designated by 1996 . The portion of the route along Plantation Road became concurrent with DE 24 Alt. by 2006 .

 Delaware Route 1 Business ( DE 1 Bus . ) is a business route of DE 1 that runs through Milford . DE 1 Bus. starts at a partial interchange with DE 1 southeast of Milford in Sussex County , with access to southbound DE 1 and from northbound DE 1 . From this interchange , the route heads northwest into Milford as two @-@ lane undivided Rehoboth Boulevard , passing residential subdivisions . The road continues past homes and some businesses , passing to the east of Marshall <unk> before reaching an intersection with DE 36 . DE 1 Bus. curves north before it heads northwest into wooded areas and passes over the Mispillion River on a drawbridge , at which point it enters Kent County . The route heads into business areas and crosses DE 14 . The road continues past commercial establishments and turns north onto North Walnut Street . DE 1 Bus. passes to the west of Milford High School and heads north to an intersection with US 113 , at which point it becomes concurrent with that route on four @-@ lane divided Dupont Boulevard . US 113 and DE 1 Bus. continue north for a short distance and end at which point the road merges onto northbound DE 1 at a partial interchange at the north end of Milford . 
 What is now DE 1 Bus. south of DE 36 and along North Walnut Street and US 113 was completed as a state highway by 1925 . In 1926 , suggestions were made to build a bypass east of Milford connecting DuPont Boulevard ( US 113 ) north of town to the state highway leading southeast to Rehoboth Beach in order to provide a better route to the beaches and reduce traffic congestion in Milford during the summer months . In 1928 , plans were made to build the bypass , which included a drawbridge over the Mispillion River . Construction on the drawbridge was underway in 1929 . The bypass to the east of Milford , along with the drawbridge , were completed in 1930 . When Delaware designated its state highways by 1936 , DE 14 was designated along Rehoboth Boulevard south of Northeast Front Street , where the route turned to the west . The divided Milford Bypass to the east of the city was completed in 1971 . In 1977 , DE 1 Bus. was designated onto its current alignment , running concurrent with DE 14 southeast of Northeast Front Street . The DE 14 concurrency was removed by 1984 when that route was realigned to follow Northeast Front Street to DE 1 .

 = Action of 15 November 1810 = 
 The Action of 15 November 1810 was a minor naval engagement fought during the British Royal Navy blockade of the French Channel ports in the Napoleonic Wars . British dominance at sea , enforced by a strategy of close blockade , made it difficult for the French Navy to operate even in their own territorial waters . In the autumn of 1810 , a British squadron assigned to patrol the Baie de la Seine was effectively isolating two French squadrons in the ports of Le Havre and Cherbourg . On 12 November , the squadron in Le Havre , consisting of frigates Elisa and Amazone attempted to reach Cherbourg at night in order to united the squadrons . This squadron was spotted in the early hours of 13 November by the patrolling British frigates HMS Diana and HMS Niobe , which gave chase . 
 The French ships took shelter at the heavily fortified Iles Saint @-@ Marcouf , sailing the following morning for the anchorage at Saint @-@ Vaast @-@ la @-@ Hougue . For two days the British frigates kept watch , until two ships of the line from the blockade of Cherbourg , HMS Donegal and HMS Revenge , arrived . On 15 November , the British squadron attacked the anchored French ships , which were defended by shore batteries at La Hougue and <unk> . After four attempts to close with the French the British squadron , under heavy fire , withdrew . During the night , the British commander , Captain Pulteney Malcolm , sent his ship 's boats close inshore to attack the French ships with Congreve rockets , a newly issued weapon . None are recorded as landing on target , but by morning both frigates had been forced to change position , becoming grounded on the shore . The French ships were later refloated , and Malcolm 's squadron maintained the blockade until 27 November when Amazone successfully escaped back to Le Havre . The damaged Elisa remained at anchor until 6 December , when an attack by a British bomb vessel forced the frigate to move further inshore , becoming grounded once more . Elisa remained in this position until 23 December , when the boats of Diana entered the anchorage at night and set the beached ship on fire , destroying her . 
 = = Baie de la Seine in 1810 = = 
 By 1810 the French Navy fleet based in the Atlantic ports had been prevented from launching any major operations for four years , penned into harbour by the British strategy of close blockade . A failed attempt by a French fleet to sail had been defeated at the Battle of Basque Roads in 1809 , and the main operations still carried out by the Navy were undertaken by privateers and frigate squadrons operating commerce raiders operating from smaller ports , such as those on the English Channel . In November 1810 squadrons were based at Cherbourg , with two ships of the line and the newly built frigate Iphigénie , and Le Havre , with the frigates Elisa and Amazone , commanded by Captains Louis @-@ Henri <unk> @-@ <unk> and Bernard @-@ Louis Rosseau respectively . To blockade these squadrons , the Royal Navy 's Channel Fleet had assigned the ships of the line HMS Donegal under Captain Pulteney Malcolm and HMS Revenge under Captain Charles Paget to patrol the entrance to Cherbourg , while frigates HMS Diana under Captain Charles Grant and HMS Niobe under Captain John Wentworth Loring kept watch on Le Havre . The blockade had achieved some minor successes ; in October 1810 Revenge had captured the privateer Vengeur from Dieppe , and on 6 November Donegal ran down and seized the privateer Surcouf from Cherbourg .

 At 22 : 00 on 12 November Amazone and Elisa sailed from Le Havre to unite with the force at Cherbourg , hoping to evade the blockade in the darkness . They successfully passed the patrolling Diana and Niobe but were spotted sailing northwest at 00 : 30 by the British ships which gave chase , Niobe turning inshore in an attempt to cut off the French line of advance . With the wind in the northeast , the French frigates were unable to pass Cape Barfleur under pursuit , and Rosseau instead turned his squadron towards the Iles Saint @-@ Marcouf at 04 : 00 , using superior local knowledge to bypass the pursuing British ships . The heavily fortified islands had been under British control during the French Revolutionary Wars , but reverted to the French at the Peace of Amiens in 1802 . Diana and Niobe attempted to intercept the French frigates before they came under the shelter of the guns , but were only able to fire two long @-@ distance broadsides at the trailing Elisa . 
 At 11 : 00 , Rosseau gave orders for the French frigates to sail once more , slipping away from the British ships which had drifted to the north and anchoring safely between the batteries at Saint @-@ Vaast @-@ la @-@ Hougue and the island of <unk> . Observing the strong position the French frigates had taken up , Grant sent messages to Malcolm 's force at Cherbourg requesting reinforcements . Malcolm brought Donegal and Revenge to support the frigates on 14 November , maintaining position off the anchorage despite a strong gale which caused Elisa to drag her anchors . Captain <unk> @-@ <unk> was forced to throw much of the ship 's stores overboard to prevent his frigate from being wrecked on the shore . The following day , Diana took advantage of the rising tide to attack the anchored Amazone , Captain Rosseau withdrawing deeper into the sheltered anchorage under protection from the batteries . Twice more Grant launched probing attacks on the French frigate , each time beaten off by heavy fire from the batteries . Joined by Malcolm and the remainder of the British force , four successive attacks were launched against Amazone , each one driven back by cannon fire . At 13 : 00 , with the tide falling , the British squadron was compelled to retreat to deeper water , out of range of the French . All four British ships had suffered under fire , with two killed and five wounded on Revenge , three wounded on Donegal and one wounded on Diana . French losses were a single man killed on Amazone . 
 On the evening of 15 November Malcolm ordered the ship 's boats of the squadron to approach the anchorage under cover of darkness , commanded by Lieutenant Joseph Needham Taylor . The boats had been equipped with Congreve rockets , a recently invented artillery system which was not then widely in use by the Royal Navy . None of the rockets fired during the night appeared to have hit their targets , but they seem to have panicked the French crews ; dawn the following morning revealed that both frigates had cut their anchors and drifted onto the shore , Elisa in particular had struck hard and heeled over onto her side . Both ships were however successfully refloated by the rising tide on 16 November , and the situation reached an impasse , with Malcolm 's forces blockading Saint @-@ Vaast @-@ la @-@ Hougue to prevent the French from sailing . 
 = = = Destruction of Elisa = = = 
 For nearly two weeks the French frigates remained at anchor , Malcolm and Grant drawing up plans for an attack with fireships , when Amazone successfully slipped out of harbour on 27 November , returning successfully to Le Havre before dawn the following day . With Amazone gone , Grant maintained a closer watch on Elisa , calling up a bomb vessel to attack the anchorage on 6 December . This proved no more accurate than the rockets , but Elisa was again driven into shallow waters to avoid the attack , this time becoming irretrievably grounded on a shoal . Over the next two weeks Elisa remained grounded , the frigate gradually being reduced to the state of a total wreck . On 23 December Grant sent his boats , commanded by Lieutenant Thomas Rowe , into the anchorage under cover of darkness and set the wreck on fire to ensure that the frigate 's stores could not be salvaged . 
 With the destruction of Elisa , the British squadrons returned to their blockade duties off Cherbourg and Le Havre . The blockade remained in place throughout the remainder of the Napoleonic Wars ; Rosseau in Amazone made another attempt to join the squadron in Cherbourg in March 1811 , only to be run down and destroyed by a squadron led by the ship of the line HMS Berwick . The new Iphigénie survived a little longer , being intercepted and captured in the Atlantic during a raiding mission in January 1814 . 
 = Lihou = 
 Lihou ( / <unk> / ) is a small tidal island located just off the west coast of the island of Guernsey , in the English Channel , between Great Britain and France . Administratively , Lihou forms part of the Parish of St. Peter 's in the Bailiwick of Guernsey , and is now owned by the Parliament of Guernsey ( officially known as the States of Guernsey ) , although there have been a number of owners in the past . Since 2006 , the island has been jointly managed by the Guernsey Environment Department and the Lihou Charitable Trust . In the past the island was used by locals for the collection of seaweed for use as a fertiliser , but today Lihou is mainly used for tourism , including school trips . Lihou is also an important centre for conservation , forming part of a Ramsar wetland site for the preservation of rare birds and plants as well as historic ruins of a priory and a farmhouse . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 In common with several nearby islands such as Jethou and <unk> , the name contains the Norman suffix " <unk> " which means a small hill or a mound . The name could have developed from the Breton words <unk> or <unk> , which means in or near water . Historically , there have also been a number of alternative forms of the name including <unk> , which was attested as early as the twelfth century , and <unk> , which was mentioned in the sixteenth century . 
 Lihou is also a common family name on Guernsey , with records suggesting that the name has been in use in the Channel Islands since at least the eighteenth century , including Royal Navy Captain John Lihou , who discovered and named the Australian Port Lihou Island and Lihou Reef . The name is also attested further afield , in a number of other countries such as Australia , where for example , Sergeant James Lihou , the son of a migrant from Guernsey , enlisted in the Australian forces in 1916 and was killed in action in 1918 in France . There are also numerous instances of people with the surname having migrated from the Channel Islands to the United States .

 Lihou is the furthest west of the Channel Islands and at low tide it is linked to the nearby L <unk> headland , on Guernsey , by a 400 m ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) stone causeway . Apart from shingle beaches , the island has a 20 m ( 66 ft ) high ridge running approximately north @-@ south . Lihou is mainly composed of weathered rock below which are found granite and gneiss bedrock . The island has a mild oceanic climate like other Channel Islands , due to being buffered by the nearby English and French coastlines . Lihou shares the weather features of Guernsey , with winter temperatures falling to 4 @.@ 4 ° C ( 39 @.@ 9 ° F ) in February and summers with a high of 19 @.@ 5 ° C ( 67 @.@ 1 ° F ) in August . 
 Two small islets , close to the island , called <unk> and <unk> , are breeding places for a number of endangered species of birds , including Eurasian oystercatchers and common ringed plovers . Numerous other species of birds and plants are found on Lihou such as peregrine falcons and sea <unk> . The Guernsey Environment Department does not allow visitors to go to the two islets and the shingle bank at certain times of the year in order to allow the birds to breed . Approximately 800 metres ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) north of the island is a submerged ledge called Grand <unk> , which was considered to be a hazard to navigation in the nineteenth century . 
 Lihou island was identified as a " Site of Nature Conservation Importance " in 1989 , and as part of an " Important Bird Area " which includes parts of the shoreline of Guernsey . On 1 March 2006 , Lihou and the L <unk> headland were designated a part of Guernsey 's first Ramsar wetland site , covering about 427 hectares ( 1 @,@ 060 acres ) of land and sea . This has created a marine reserve for the extensive variety of wildlife including more than 200 species of seaweed on the shores of Lihou , and more than 150 species of birds observed in the area . 
 The geology of Lihou Island is rather complex , but closely associated with neighbouring Guernsey . 
 = = History = = 
 The history of Lihou is closely linked to the history of Guernsey in particular and the Channel Islands in general . The earliest evidence of habitation are Mesolithic era objects recovered from archaeological digs of the 1990s , along with Neolithic era tombs on the nearby mainland . The recorded history of Lihou began in 933 AD when the Channel Islands were seized from Brittany by the ruler of Normandy . Lihou and the nearby Neolithic tombs were traditionally believed to have been meeting places for local witches , and fairies . This led to conflict with church authorities , especially when a priory was established on Lihou , dedicated to St. Mary ( known locally as Our Lady of Lihou ) . A number of dates have been suggested for the establishment of the priory , with estimates ranging from as early as 1114 , to as late as 1156 . Records suggest that the priory was an <unk> @-@ fief of the Benedictine abbey of Mont St. Michel under whose authority it operated . Ownership of the island was granted to the abbey by Robert I , Duke of Normandy , in the early part of the eleventh century . The priory is thought to have been constructed with contributions from the islanders , who appear to have been fairly affluent at the time .
