 The first tournament of 2002 for Serevi was in Chile . Fiji advanced to the semi @-@ finals where they faced New Zealand . During the match Serevi was tackled late by New Zealander <unk> Valence . Fijian player Marika Vunibaka ran 50 metres to punch Valence and a brawl then erupted – Fiji ended up losing the game . Serevi and Fiji rebounded the following week to win the tournament at Mar del Plata , Buenos Aires . Serevi played in the Brisbane , Wellington , and then Beijing Sevens before returning to Hong Kong . In Fiji 's defeat of Australia in their quarter @-@ final , Serevi scored 13 points to take his Hong Kong points tally over 1000 . Fiji defeated New Zealand in their semi @-@ final and faced England in the final . England defeated Fiji 33 – 20 in the final . Later that year Serevi captained Fiji to the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester . He helped get the team to the games ' final with a try @-@ saving tackle during Fiji 's 17 – 7 defeat of South Africa in their semi @-@ final . The final was against New Zealand , and despite Serevi landing a penalty to give Fiji a 15 – 14 lead with two minutes left , New Zealand won 33 – 17 . This gave Serevi his second Commonwealth Games silver medal . 
 Serevi did not represent Fiji in sevens in 2003 , being controversially omitted from Fiji 's Hong Kong Sevens squad . Serevi had been unable to return to Fiji for a fitness test and national tournament due to commitments with his club Stade Montois in France . Because of this he was omitted from the team , despite being available to play in the tournament . 
 After recovering from his injury , Serevi was named in the Fiji sevens squad in January 2004 . This was despite a rule enforced by coach <unk> <unk> that to be eligible to play , one must attend the team 's trials . After being named in the training squad , Serevi was not selected for the squad for the Wellington or Los Angeles legs of the IRB World Sevens Series . He then missed selection for the team to play in Hong Kong for the second year in a row . <unk> <unk> replaced <unk> as Fiji 's coach and recalled Serevi to play in the Bordeaux Sevens . Serevi then played in the London leg of the Sevens Series – his last leg of the year .

 Serevi started the year by leading the <unk> Barbarians in the Pacific 7s in Auckland , New Zealand . He returned to Fiji , from his club Staines in England , in February that year in an attempt to play for Fiji in the 2005 Rugby World Cup Sevens . On returning to Fiji , Serevi said " My goal is to go to the World Cup " . After being selected by coach Wayne Pivac for the Fiji squad , Serevi was named as captain . 
 Led by Serevi , Fiji qualified for the quarter @-@ finals of the Sevens World Cup at Hong Kong , with pool victories over Australia , Canada , Hong Kong , Japan and Portugal . After the pool matches , Pivac said of Serevi ; " Waisale is the eyes for the other guys " and " he brings the others into the game and puts players into gaps . " After scoring the match @-@ winning try in sudden death against England in their semi @-@ final , Serevi led Fiji to World Cup victory over New Zealand in the final . He finished the tournament as the World Cup 's all @-@ time leading points scorer and goal scorer , and the second highest all @-@ time try scorer . 
 A national holiday – 24 March 2005 – was declared in Fiji for the teams return , and the country 's Prime Minister <unk> <unk> declared : 
 On behalf of the Government and people of Fiji and personally , I convey our congratulations to you all – Serevi and the team members , and the management and coaching staff . 
 Serevi was appointed Pivac 's successor as Fiji coach on 30 March , and soon after he returned to his village in <unk> to show its people the Melrose Cup . 
 Serevi 's first tournament as coach was the Singapore leg of the IRB Sevens Series ; Fiji was defeated by England in their semi @-@ final . The last two legs of the 2004 – 05 IRB Sevens Series were played in London and Paris . There he coached Fiji to the Plate victory , and a final loss respectively . His first major trophy as coach came when Fiji won gold in the 2005 World Games in Germany . 
 For the entire 2005 – 06 IRB Sevens Series Serevi was Fiji 's player @-@ coach ( his assistant coach was Jo <unk> ) . Fiji won the George leg in South Africa , the Wellington leg in New Zealand , the Singapore leg , and the London leg in England . The team also made the final of the Dubai , Los Angeles , and Hong Kong legs of the series . Fiji won the Series – becoming the first team other than New Zealand to do so . Following the series win Prime Minister <unk> said of Serevi : 
 You have set an example of what we can do as a country through vision , sacrifice , hard work , discipline , and making the best use of our gifts and talents . 
 In Fiji , celebrations of the win even included a specially composed song dedicated to Serevi named Na Noda <unk> . 
 As well as coaching Fiji to the IRB Series win in 2006 , Serevi also coached them to bronze at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne . There Fiji faced England in their semi @-@ final , but Serevi was unable to take the field due to " a technical hitch with the fourth official . " After losing to England , Fiji recovered to defeat Australia 24 – 17 in the play @-@ off for bronze . 
 In December 2006 Serevi was offered a coaching position with the Falcons , a South African side . The offer was several times more than he received from the Fiji Rugby Union . The contract required him to be a backline coach and player for two years , and then a coach for the next three years . In the end he decided to instead renew his contract with the Fiji Rugby Union . In early 2007 the interim Sports Minister Lekh Ram <unk> appointed Serevi to the board of the interim Fiji Sports Council . 
 Serevi coached Fiji to the final of the first Sevens Series leg of 2007 in Wellington , where they lost to Samoa 17 – 14 in the final . The team then rebounded when they defeated Samoa to win the San Diego leg . Fiji 's next tournament was Hong Kong where Serevi made a world record 18th appearance . He scored the final try as Fiji defeated New Zealand in Hong Kong . They then faced Samoa in the final ; Samoa led 27 – 0 at half time . Although Fiji then scored 22 points in the second half , Samoa won the final 27 – 22 . Fiji won the following tournament at Adelaide , but only after a converted try by Serevi forcing extra time in their quarter final with South Africa . 
 Serevi then coached Fiji to the final of the London leg , where they were defeated by New Zealand . The final leg of the 2006 – 07 Series was in Edinburgh . Fiji needed to qualify for the semi @-@ finals to guarantee they would win the series . They qualified top of pool A and faced Wales in their quarter @-@ final . Wales defeated Fiji in 21 – 14 in a major upset . " Wales kept the ball well against us , and they scored tries . They deserved to win , " Serevi said of the loss . New Zealand then won the tournament , making them the series champions after accumulating 130 points to Fiji 's 128 . On 6 July 2007 , Serevi announced his resignation as coach of the national sevens team .

 On 24 July 2008 , the Fiji Rugby Union announced the return of Serevi as Fiji 's coach for the 2008 – 09 IRB World Sevens Series and the Rugby Sevens World Cup in Dubai . At the time of the announcement , Serevi was in England receiving an honorary sports degree from Leeds Metropolitan University . Fiji Rugby Union chairman Keni <unk> denied that Serevi 's selection was a result of the public clamour after the team 's performance in the 2007 – 08 World Sevens Series under coach Jo <unk> . 
 Despite his return , Serevi 's team did not do well in the first two legs of the 2008 – 09 World Sevens Series , losing their semi @-@ finals in both to South Africa . He also clashed with the Fiji Rugby Union over being left out of player selection duties . As a result , he was dismissed on 29 January 2009 . <unk> <unk> took over the post for the rest of the series . 
 In August 2009 , the Papua New Guinea Rugby Football Union ( <unk> ) hired Serevi to become their sevens development officer on a five @-@ year contract . He was later appointed the national sevens coach . However , on 27 March 2010 , the <unk> confirmed that the working relationship with Serevi was finished . Union president Richard <unk> said off @-@ field decisions prompted the severing of relations , especially after Papua New Guinea performed poorly at the Adelaide sevens .

 Seeking a fresh start a few months after his departure from the Papua New Guinea team , Serevi moved his family to the United States and settled in Seattle , Washington , to run a business with Fijian expatriates . He used his experience in rugby to open a new brand , the Serevi Rugby Nation , to help pool funds for Pacific Islander players and also run rugby training workshops for the youth . He also worked with the Old Puget Sound Rugby club , and helped Central Washington University qualify for the Collegiate Rugby Championships . On 6 October 2011 , Serevi returned to Fiji and declared his availability to coach the team in qualifying for the 2013 Sevens World Cup and help the team qualify for the 2016 Olympic Games . He was eventually appointed assistant coach for Fiji at the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens in Russia .

They have three children : daughters <unk> Serevi ( born 1994 ) and <unk> Serevi ( <unk> ) ( born 1995 ) , and son Waisale Serevi Junior ( born 2001 ) . His wife works for the Fijian Defence Force , and Serevi spent large parts of his career away from his family . He was apart from them when in Japan between 1992 and 1997 , although his family joined him in France between 1999 and 2004 . He is a committed Christian , and along with his family attends Church regularly . On his boots , strapping , and jersey for every match Serevi has the words " Philippians 4 : 13 " written . It is a reference to the biblical quote " I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me " . 
 Serevi learned Japanese while in Japan , and also taught English whilst there . Despite living in France for several years he did not learn French , and required an interpreter for interviews . Serevi 's interests include listening to music , and watching movies . Apart from rugby , he also likes to play touch rugby and volleyball . Other interests include meeting people , and travelling the world . 
 On 18 May 2007 , Serevi was appointed a Special Inspector with the Fiji Police Force by the acting Commissioner of Police <unk> <unk> . The appointment is in youth and community policing . Serevi will not be a regular officer , but will be paid for the hours he works .

 = Japanese battleship Tosa = 
 Tosa ( <unk> ) was a planned battleship of the Imperial Japanese Navy . Designed by Yuzuru Hiraga , she was envisioned as the lead ship of the Tosa class of two 39 @,@ 900 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 40 @,@ 540 t ) ships . The battleships would have been armed with ten 410 mm ( 16 @.@ 1 in ) guns and bring Japan closer to its goal of an " Eight @-@ four " fleet ( eight battleships and four battlecruisers ) . However , after the Washington Naval Conference and the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty , all work on the ship was halted . With the vessel required to be destroyed in accordance with the terms of the treaty , the incomplete Tosa was then subjected to various tests to gauge the effect of Japanese weaponry before being scuttled on 9 February 1925 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 For additional details and design information , see Tosa @-@ class battleship 
 Designed by Yuzuru Hiraga , Tosa was intended to be part of a Japanese " Eight @-@ four fleet " , comprising eight battleships and four battlecruisers , the successor to the proposed " Eight @-@ eight fleet " . Tosa and her sister ship Kaga were intended to be the second set of high @-@ speed battleships ( after the Nagato class ) under the plan , and were approved for construction in the Diet 's 14 July 1917 warship @-@ building authorization . Engineering blueprints for the two ships were completed by Japanese naval engineers in 1919 . Based on Japanese studies of the British experience at the Battle of Jutland , the ships were to include new features over previous designs , including higher steaming speed despite increased tonnage , flush decks , and inclined armor . 
 Tosa was laid down on 16 February 1920 by Mitsubishi in Nagasaki . She utilized the same slipway where , two decades later , the Yamato @-@ class battleship Musashi would be built . Tosa was originally scheduled to be launched in October 1921 , but multiple strikes delayed it until November . Ultimately , the battleship was not launched until 18 December 1921 , two months behind schedule . Fitting @-@ out commenced soon after with a projected completion date of July 1922 . However , work on Tosa was halted on 5 February 1922 , one day before Japan signed the Washington Naval Treaty . Under the terms of the treaty , construction of Tosa and Kaga was formally canceled on 5 May 1922 . 
 = = Career = = 
 In August 1922 , Tosa was moved to Kure , still incomplete . Fifty thousand people turned out to watch as the battleship was towed out of the harbor by five tugboats . The barbettes for the 406 mm ( 16 inch ) guns were in place , but no turrets or weapons had been mounted , so the holes in the main deck were covered with a mesh @-@ like material . Her hull was finished , and a superstructure deck , bridge deck and conning tower had been fitted , along with a light signal mast directly aft of the second barbette . The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge , as there was no other suitable location ; compared with those of similar ships , it was much smaller , as it only contained two levels and bridge wings . An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small funnel was fitted so that heat could be supplied within the ship . 
 Tosa remained in Kure until mid @-@ 1924 . Stricken on 1 April 1924 , the ship — with her hull virtually finished — was designated for use in testing the effectiveness of shells and torpedoes against its armor arrangements . As a result , in June 1924 the navy 's gunnery school took possession of the hull and prepared it for testing . 
 = = = Test target = = = 
 During 6 – 13 June , Tosa was subjected to five explosions . The first involved a 100 kg ( 220 lb ) Mk . I mine placed on the starboard side of the ship , 3 @.@ 7 m ( 12 ft ) below the waterline at frame 57 . The resultant explosion ruptured about 22 m2 ( 240 sq ft ) of hull , while dishing in another 750 sq ft ( 70 m2 ) of plating . Flooding took 23 compartments within the ship , 17 quickly and five slowly ; a total of 995 long tons ( 1 @,@ 011 t ) of water entered the ship , increasing the ship 's list to starboard by about 1 ° 54 ' . 
 The second and fifth test charges ( 8 and 13 June ) were both placed near the fore main battery magazines . Involving larger charges than the first — about 200 kg ( 440 lb ) ( a 6th year type torpedo ) and 150 kg ( 330 lb ) ( a 9th year type mine ) — they were both placed at frame 87 : the second to port and 4 @.@ 04 m ( 13 @.@ 3 ft ) below the waterline , the fifth to starboard and 6 @.@ 34 m ( 20 @.@ 8 ft ) below . Both broached the side protection system — allowing 1 @,@ 008 and 726 long tons ( 1 @,@ 024 and 738 t ) of water , respectively , to enter the ship — showing that the usual three @-@ compartment , all @-@ void system used in most Japanese battleships was an insufficient defense against modern torpedoes . The list incurred during test two was a 6 ° 16 ' change , resulting in a port list of 4 ° 36 ' ; for test five these numbers were 4 ° 38 ' and a starboard list of 0 ° 48 ' . 
 Similar to two and five , tests three and four were conducted at the same frame ( 192 ) but on opposite sides . Frame 192 was in the middle of the ship , where the ship 's protection system was designed to be the strongest . Test three ( 8 June ) was a 300 kg ( 660 lb ) 8th year type torpedo on the starboard side at a depth of 4 @.@ 05 m ( 13 @.@ 3 ft ) under the ship 's waterline ; four ( 12 June ) was a 350 kg ( 770 lb ) torpedo to port , 4 @.@ 9 m ( 16 ft ) below the waterline . The tests ruptured 15 and 26 m2 ( 160 and 280 sq ft ) , dished in 160 and 110 m2 ( 1 @,@ 700 and 1 @,@ 200 sq ft ) of plating , and allowed 1 @,@ 203 and 1 @,@ 160 long tons ( 1 @,@ 222 and 1 @,@ 180 t ) of water to enter the ship . Test three allowed the most water in out of all of the tests and , as a result , the list was altered from a previous port @-@ side 2 ° 51 ' to a starboard @-@ side 5 ° 22 ' — a change of 8 ° 13 ' . Test four went from a starboard 1 ° 0 ' to a port 5 ° 20 ' . 
 Further tests included the explosion of several Type 8 torpedoes filled with 300 – 346 kg ( 660 – 760 lbs ) of picric acid within Tosa 's designed magazine for them , which was located forward of the first turret and had been considered a weak point in previous battleship designs . This caused " extreme structural damage above the waterline " to Tosa , and confirmed that any problem in that part of the ship could seriously harm it . Possible solutions included the installation of additional armor over the room or the use of walls on one side of the magazine that would be blown out and away from the ship in the event of any serious explosion inside . This would have the effect of focusing the explosion outside , minimizing structural damage to the ship itself . Another test involved the explosion of 370 kg ( 820 lb ) of TNT 5 m ( 16 ft ) away from the side of the ship . 
 Another test conducted somewhere around this time involved a 406 mm ( 16 @.@ 0 in ) gun firing a shell at Tosa . It fell about 25 metres ( 82 ft ) short of the ship , but continued through the water and struck the ship near frame 228 , 3 @.@ 3 metres ( 11 ft ) below the designed waterline . The result was disturbing , as the shell was able to pass through the 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) armor and explode in the port engine room . As a result , 3 @,@ 000 long tons ( 3 @,@ 048 t ) of water was let in , and Tosa 's list was increased from 4 ° 53 ' to 10 ° 06 ' . 
 Results of the tests on Tosa were subsequently used in the refitting and reconstruction of existing warships . Lessons learned were also incorporated into the designs of the two Yamato @-@ class super @-@ battleships ten years later . In the latter , this meant that the side belt armor was continued below the waterline and beneath the torpedo bulge so that the class would have a defense against underwater shells . 
 = = Sinking = = 
 For the next few months , Tosa was given to the Hiroshima gunnery school for use as a target . On 14 January 1925 , the Navy Ministry of Japan ordered Tosa to be scuttled within one month 's time . To ensure this , the Commander in Chief of the Kure Naval District directed that preparations for scuttling the ship be completed by 1 February . It was planned that Tosa would be scuttled on or before 10 February after being towed by the former battleship Settsu to a location south of the <unk> Lighthouse and 16 @.@ 1 kilometers ( 10 mi ) west of Okinoshima Island ( located southwest of the present @-@ day Kōchi Prefecture ) . Later that month , the United States Office of Naval Intelligence reported that " work on the dismantling of [ Tosa ] has been going on at the Kure Navy Yard and everything possible has been removed . The intention is to fill her hull with sand and gravel , tow her out to deep water near the entrance to Kure , open her sea cocks , and send her to the bottom . " 
 Tosa was brought from Kure on 3 February to Saiki Bay in the Bungo Channel . She was then towed from the bay on the 6th with the intention of bringing the battleship to the designated sinking spot , but were thwarted by a strong storm and returned . A second attempt was made at 10 : 00 on the 8th . Explosive " mines " were embarked : two 360 mm ( 14 @.@ 2 in ) shells were placed inside Tosa 's double bottom , and two containers with 30 kg ( 66 lb ) of Shimose powder in each were put into the engine room on the port side . They would be detonated using electrical fuses , though time fuses were also fitted for use if the sea was calm . The explosives were triggered on the 8th , but they failed , so a contingent was sent aboard Tosa on the 9th ; they opened six Kingston valves in the engine room at about 01 : 25 . Soon after , Tosa slowly began to sink by the stern and to starboard . By 03 : 50 , the rate increased , and the ship slipped beneath the waves by 07 : 00 . Tosa was the tenth and final Japanese capital ship sunk or scrapped to comply with the naval treaty 's stipulations . 
 = Roquebert 's expedition to the Caribbean = 
 Roquebert 's expedition to the Caribbean , was an unsuccessful operation by a French naval squadron to transport supplies to Guadeloupe in December 1809 at the height of the Napoleonic Wars . Over the previous year , British Royal Navy squadrons had isolated and defeated the French Caribbean colonies one by one , until by the autumn Guadeloupe was the only colony remaining in French hands . Cut off from the rest of the world by British blockade squadrons that intercepted all ships coming to or from the island , Guadeloupe was in a desperate situation , facing economic collapse , food shortages and social upheaval , as well as the impending threat of British invasion . In an effort to reinforce and resupply the colony , the French government sent four frigates to the West Indies in November 1809 under Commodore François Roquebert . Two of the ships were only lightly armed , their cannon removed to make room for supplies and troops . Two others were at full strength , ordered to protect the storeships on their journey from the British forces operating off both the French and Guadeloupe coasts . 
 The squadron almost reached the Caribbean without encountering any of patrolling British warships sent to watch for French reinforcements , but was spotted and intercepted by the frigate HMS Junon on 13 December . Junon 's captain did not realise the size of the French squadron until it was too late and , despite fierce resistance , his ship was captured and he was mortally wounded . Continuing with the mission , Roquebert successfully delivered the disarmed frigates Loire and Seine to within sight of Guadeloupe and then left them , his frigates making their way back to France without ensuring the safe arrival of their convoy . On 15 December , the small British brig HMS Observateur , which had witnessed the defeat of Junon , brought news of the French arrival to the blockade squadron anchored off Basse @-@ Terre . Summoning ships from the surrounding region , the British commander , Captain Volant Vashon Ballard amassed a significant squadron and forced the French supply ships to anchor in a protected bay at Anse la Barque , on the southeastern coast of Guadeloupe . 
 <unk> efforts were made to capture the French ships , but it was not until the arrival of the 74 @-@ gun HMS Sceptre under Captain Samuel James Ballard that an attack was made in earnest . As small ships engaged the batteries on shore , two frigates entered the bay and attacked the disarmed frigates , causing both to surrender in an hour @-@ long engagement . Both French ships were badly damaged and a fire started during the engagement was able to rapidly spread through them , destroying both ships in succession . Many of the French crew escaped ashore from the wrecks , while others were picked up by British ships . The blockade of Guadeloupe was successfully maintained , and the island was captured in a coordinated invasion a month later . Roquebert 's remaining ships were intercepted on 16 January by a patrolling British frigate , but successfully escaped pursuit and eventually returned undamaged to France . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the Napoleonic Wars , the Royal Navy rapidly and decisively seized control of the war at sea , driving French ships into protected harbours and laying heavy blockades on ports held by the French Empire and her allies to strangle communications and overseas trade . This had a devastating effect on the French West Indian colonies , particularly the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe . With trade impossible , their economies stagnated while social upheaval and limited food supplies reduced their ability to resist invasion by the large British forces maintained in the region . In the summer of 1808 , desperate messages were sent to France from the islands , prompting a succession of French efforts to supply food , reinforcements and trading opportunities during the latter part of 1808 and the first months of 1809 . These efforts were entirely unsuccessful : the few ships that did safely reach the Caribbean Sea and successfully landed supplies were all intercepted and captured on the return journey , costing the French four frigates and numerous smaller ships by the end of February 1809 . 
 The British blockade squadrons had intercepted a number of the messages sent from the islands during 1808 , and a large expeditionary force was built up on Barbados with orders to invade and capture the French colonies as swiftly as possible . Their first target was Martinique , which was invaded and captured during February 1809 . Outlying islands were captured over the next few months and a major French reinforcement squadron was trapped and then defeated near the Îles des Saintes in April : the French lost a ship of the line , and two more frigates were captured in June and July as they tried to return to France . With such heavy losses , the French took time preparing their next effort while the British were distracted by the Reconquista in Santo Domingo , a Spanish campaign to drives the French out of the island of Hispaniola that was eventually concluded in July 1809 with British naval assistance . By the autumn of 1809 , the British commander , Vice @-@ Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane , was again developing an expeditionary force , this time aimed at Guadeloupe . He had strengthened the blockade squadron off the island 's principal port Basse @-@ Terre , and placed heavier forces at Martinique in case they were required . Individual ships were dispersed in the approaches to the French island , ready to intercept any approaching reinforcement . Other ships operated against ships already anchored off Guadeloupe : one squadron seized the corvette Nisus from Deshaies on 12 December . 
 In the months since Troude 's failure , the French had only sent small supply ships to Guadeloupe , while carefully preparing a major expedition at Nantes . Two old frigates , Loire and Seine , were largely disarmed , a process known as en flûte : half their guns were removed and their crew reduced in order to take on board large quantities of food supplies and over 200 military reinforcements each . Command of the armed storeships was given to lieutenants Joseph @-@ Normand <unk> and Bernard Vincent . To protect these ships two fully armed frigates were detailed to escort the convoy to Guadeloupe : Renommée , under Commodore François Roquebert , and Clorinde , under Captain Jacques Saint @-@ Cricq . The force departed on 15 November 1809 and made rapid progress across the Atlantic , avoiding all contact with British warships . Of the small ships despatched around the same time , none reached Guadeloupe ; all were captured in the Western Atlantic or Caribbean by warships sent by Cochrane to patrol for approaching French reinforcements . 
 = = Destruction of HMS Junon = = 
 Among the ships despatched by Cochrane was the 40 @-@ gun frigate HMS Junon under Captain John Shortland . Junon had been captured from the French less than a year earlier at the Action of 10 February 1809 , following an unsuccessful attempt to return to France from Guadeloupe . Hastily repaired , she had been commissioned into the Royal Navy and added to Cochrane 's fleet , from where Cochrane had ordered her to patrol to the east of Antigua for ships attempting to evade the British blockade . On 13 December , Shortland , in company with the 16 @-@ gun brig HMS Observateur under Captain Frederick Wetherall , stopped an American merchant ship and boarded her in search of contraband . As he was engaged in the search , four sails appeared to the north . Shortland immediately gave chase , and by 16 : 00 realised his quarry was a squadron of four frigates . Firing warning shots in an effort to force the frigates to identify themselves , the strange ships raised Spanish colours . Initially unconvinced , Shortland raised the recognition signal for Spanish vessels and received the correct reply from the lead frigate . Closing with the ships during the afternoon , Junon was only a short distance from the lead ship at 17 : 30 when French colours replaced the Spanish and Roquebert ordered his ships to open fire . 
 Roquebert had learned the correct signals for Spanish shipping from captured Spanish merchant ships and , having lured Junon within range , opened a destructive fire from Renommée that caused severe damage to Junon 's rigging . Unable to manoeuvere away from the French due to the damage suffered in the opening broadside , Shortland returned fire as best he could while closing with Renommée to inflict maximum damage . As Junon closed with the flagship , Clorinde attacked her from the other side and the <unk> took up stations fore and aft , repeatedly raking the British ship . Observateur had been some distance behind Junon when the action began , and was thus not directly engaged by any of the French ships . Wetherall initially fired at Clorinde from extreme range , but soon recognised that he could do nothing to aid Junon in the face of overwhelming French numbers and so sailed westward to find and warn other British ships of the approaching French squadron . As Observateur escaped , Junon was pounded from all sides , Roquebert 's ship coming so close to the British frigate that their rigging tangled and they collided , inflicting further damage . The French squadron was so close to Junon that the soldiers carried aboard for the garrison on Guadeloupe were able to fire their muskets at the British top deck , killing many of the sailors manning the guns . 
 Within ten minutes of the first shot , Junon 's top deck was almost completely cleared and Shortland had been taken below , his leg broken by grapeshot and his body pierced by several large wooden splinters . Lieutenant Samuel Bartlett Deecker assumed command , and successfully beat off a boarding attack from Clorinde . Pulling Junon clear off the two full @-@ strength French frigates , Deecker tried to escape but found his ship unresponsive . Within minutes , Roquebert and Saint @-@ Cricq had regained their positions on either side of the British frigate and boarded simultaneously , forcing Deecker to surrender at 18 : 15 . The British had suffered heavy losses , with 20 killed and 40 wounded , including Shortland . The prisoners were dispersed among the French squadron and rather than spare the men required to repair and crew the battered Junon , Roquebert had the frigate set on fire and abandoned . French losses were also severe , Renommée losing 15 killed and three wounded and Clorinde six killed and 15 wounded . Neither Seine , Loire nor HMS Observateur suffered any loss at all . 
 = = Operations off Guadeloupe = = 
 Although Junon had been destroyed , Observateur had escaped from the French squadron and immediately sought out the blockade force off Guadeloupe , the only place that the French squadron could be destined for . Arriving at Basse @-@ Terre at 13 : 00 on 15 December , Captain Wetherall telegraphed the senior officer on the station , Captain Volant Vashon Ballard in the frigate HMS Blonde , of the impending arrival of Roquebert 's squadron . Ballard swiftly gathered his squadron , the frigate HMS Thetis under Captain George Miller and the sloops HMS Hazard and HMS Cygnet , and positioned them in the channel between Guadeloupe and the Îles des Saintes , through which Roquebert 's ships would have to pass . Urgent messages were sent to all nearby ships and bases , and the following day the sloops HMS Ringdove and HMS Scorpion joined the squadron , Ballard placing Hazard and Ringdove to watch Basse @-@ Terre while the rest of squadron patrolled to the south of the island . 
 On the same day that Observateur arrived off Basse @-@ Terre , the frigate HMS Castor under Captain William Roberts had recaptured the merchant brig Ariel near La Désirade , taken by Roquebert 's squadron two weeks earlier . Roberts also discovered two other ships in the distance to the north and had closed to investigate , discovering the French convoy . Darkness fell soon afterwards and Castor separated from the French ships , as Roberts sailed westwards as fast as possible to notify Ballard of his sighting , arriving at 04 : 00 on 17 December . In the aftermath of the destruction of Junon and the encounter with Castor , Roquebert decided to separate from the convoy and return to France , turning north with Clorinde and leaving the supply ships to make the journey to Guadeloupe independently . As a result , Loire and Seine were sailing unprotected straight towards Ballard 's squadron . 
 At daylight on 17 December , Blonde sighted the French armed storeships approaching Basse @-@ Terre from the northwest and Ballard advanced on them , blocking them from reaching Basse @-@ Terre . Retreating northwest along the southern coastline of Guadeloupe , the disarmed frigates entered a sheltered cove named Anse la Barque at 10 : 00 , sheltering under two gun batteries on either side of the bay . Lieutenants <unk> and Vincent then anchored their ships parallel with the shore , so that they had the maximum number of cannon aimed at the entrance to the cove . As Ballard 's ships cruised along the coast in light winds , seeking a way into the well @-@ protected anchorage , other batteries opened fire , one striking Ringdove off Pointe Lizard . Captain William <unk> of Ringdove then landed a shore party from his ship and stormed the battery , capturing it in 15 minutes . He demolished the position and withdrew to his ship , rejoining Ballard off Anse la Barque . Ballard then tested the feasibility of an attack on the French ships , ordering the 12 @-@ gun schooner HMS Elizabeth to assess the depth of the entrance to the bay while he in Blonde attacked the batteries directly at 16 : 00 . Discovering that the entrance was navigable . Blonde and Elizabeth withdrew out of range . Operations were then suspended for the evening to allow addition reinforcements to come up . Ballard 's squadron was joined during the night by the frigate HMS Freija under Captain John Hayes . 
 = = Destruction of Loire and Seine = = 
 At 08 : 30 on the morning of 18 December , a small boat sailed from Anse la Barque with a message offering the British a temporary truce . Simultaneously a British ship of the line , HMS Sceptre , arrived from Fort Royal on Martinique under the command of Captain Samuel James Ballard , who immediately assumed command of the diverse squadron assembled at the entrance to the bay . Ballard dismissed the French negotiators and ordered an immediate attack on the anchored frigates . His plan was simple : the frigates Blonde and Thetis would enter the harbour and engage the armed storeships directly , while Sceptre and Freija would engage the gun batteries to prevent them targeting the small brigs bringing up the rear . The brigs would be towing boats full of sailors and Royal Marines , who would storm the French ships and gun positions as they were engaged with the larger warships . 
 The plan was initially frustrated by light winds , but by 14 : 25 Blonde and Thetis were within range of the gun batteries and fifteen minutes later they were able to open fire on the disarmed frigates , although still at quite a distance . Becalmed in the bay , Blonde was forced to engage one of the forts instead , fire from the shore causing some damage but not enough to endanger the ship . Thetis was luckier , and Captain Miller was able to close with one of the French ships , although their identities during the engagement are uncertain in historical accounts and it is not clear which one was first into the action . By 15 : 35 , Thetis had dismasted her opponent , who surrendered . Moving against the second ship , Thetis was then also becalmed and was forced to engage the forts instead . As Sceptre led the remainder of the squadron into the bay , fire was seen spreading through the surrendered ship and , in the face of overwhelming opposition , the second frigate also surrendered at 16 : 20 . 
 By 17 : 10 , Thetis and Blonde began to withdraw from the bay as the fire took hold of the first frigate . The rest of the British squadron , despite heavy cannon fire from a fort on shore , successfully landed their troops and stormed and captured the defences . There were heavy casualties in the storming parties , including Hugh Cameron , captain of Hazard , who was killed by grapeshot . At 17 : 20 , the fire reached the magazines of the burning ship , and the ensuing explosion hurled burning wreckage across the bay . The British ships were largely untouched , but the second French frigate was struck by a large piece of flaming timber , which ignited her mainmast and destroyed her as well . The operations successfully completed , the British ships embarked their landing parties , who had demolished the fortifications around the bay , and returned to open water . In total they had lost eight killed and 16 wounded on Blonde , six wounded on Thetis and an uncertain number lost in the amphibious operation , although casualty figures are not known . French losses in the engagement are also uncertain , although most of the crews of Loire and Seine were able to quite easily reach the shore . Among those that did make land were a section of prisoners from Junon , including the grievously wounded Captain Shortland . Transported across the island on a wagon in the full glare of the sun , Shortland 's condition rapidly worsened and he died on 21 January 1810 without regaining consciousness . He was buried at Basse @-@ Terre with full military honours . Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by the clasp " <unk> LA <unk> 18 <unk> . 1809 " attached to the Naval General Service Medal , awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Roquebert 's remaining frigates turned north after parting from the storeships , sighting the British squadron in the distance and grounding on a sandbar off Antigua in their haste to escape . Throwing overboard their guns and stores , the ships were lightened enough to regain open water . They then returned to European waters , avoiding all contact with British shipping until 16 January 1810 at position 40 ° 50 ′ N 12 ° 09 ′ W , approximately 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) west of the Portuguese coast , when they encountered the frigate HMS Virginie under Captain Edward Brace . Brace shadowed the French frigates for two days , but was unable to close with them and Roquebert made no attempt to use his superior strength against the British frigate . Eventually , Roquebert outran Virginie and on 23 January reached Brest safely . Within a year , Roquebert and Saint @-@ Cricq would be despatched on another mission to resupply a French colony , sailing with the frigate Néréide to Île de France in December 1810 . Unknown to the French authorities , a British expeditionary force had already captured the island , and Roquebert 's squadron was ambushed in May 1811 and brought to battle off Tamatave in Madagascar . Néréide and <unk> were both captured and Roquebert killed in action . Clorinde only escaped by deserting the other ships in the middle of the engagement , fleeing north and eventually reaching France . 
 In the West Indies , the failure of the main resupply effort resulted in a further drop in morale among the defenders of Guadeloupe . Other smaller ships sent with supplies were captured during the operations against Roquebert 's squadron , including the brig <unk> captured on 14 December and Papillion on 19 December . In January 1810 , the blockade tightened : Scorpion captured the brig Oreste from inside the harbour at Basse @-@ Terre and Freija seized several coastal vessels in Baie @-@ <unk> . By 27 January , Cochrane 's preparations for the invasion of Guadeloupe were complete and 7 @,@ 000 men were landed under Lieutenant @-@ General George Beckwith . The French garrison largely deserted , and by 6 February all resistance was defeated and the governor , General Manuel Ernouf , surrendered . Over the rest of the month , the few remaining colonies belonging to France and the Netherlands were seized without opposition and the entire Caribbean was either under British or Spanish control , with the exception of the independent state of Haiti .

It is the sixth main entry of Namco 's Tales series of video games . The game was developed by Namco Tales Studio and published by Namco Games . The game was released for the PlayStation 2 on December 16 , 2004 , and then later re @-@ released on the PlayStation Portable on March 19 , 2008 . Rebirth , set in a world populated by humans ( Huma ) and beast people ( Gajuma ) , follows the adventures of Veigue <unk> , a human whose friend Claire Bennett is kidnapped by agents of Agarte , heir to the throne of the kingdom of Karegia . Setting out to rescue Claire , Veigue and those who join him becomes entangled in escalating racial conflicts consuming the land . 
 As with previous Tales games , it features an action @-@ based battle system , called the Three @-@ Line Linear Motion Battle System . The game was developed by the 2D Tales development unit Team Destiny . The characters were designed by Mutsumi Inomata , who had previously worked on Tales of Destiny . The scenario , written by Hiramatsu Masaki , dealt extensively with issues of coexistence between races and ethnic conflicts . The game has received positive reviews and strong sales in Japan , with the PlayStation 2 version eventually selling over 600 @,@ 000 units and the PSP re @-@ release selling over 83 @,@ 000 . Western sites have been positive about the game , though neither version of the game have received English localizations . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Tales of Rebirth is an action role @-@ playing game with player characters rendered as two @-@ dimensional sprites on three @-@ dimensional backgrounds . Unlike previous Tales games , the camera follows the characters from a side @-@ long view , zooming in or out depending on their relative position , and instead of a navigable overworld , players fast @-@ travel to different locations using a standard map of the game world . Side conversations between characters called Skits ( called " Screen Chat " ( <unk> , <unk> Chatto ) in Japanese ) feature both story @-@ relevant information and added details not essential to the story . 
 At certain locations in the game , characters can engage in cooking various recipes : cooking them between battles restores health points . If the recipe is cooked enough times , a character masters it . Upon mastery , a character is granted experience points each time the meal is prepared . Characters are also given " rations " , helpings of restorative food , at selected locations across the game world . While initial rations are fairly small , a special " meal ticket " is made available later in the game , which provides larger rations . There are multiple difficulty levels . Mini @-@ games are also available to play , with three types in the game . The first has the character Veigue on a raft navigating a river , with the goal being to avoid dangerous obstacles . The second is a tarot game with the character Hilda , where the player answers questions given by Hilda and has their fortune told . In the third , the player becomes a waiter at an inn , with the goal being to provide good service to the customers : poor service results in the player being dismissed , while good service earns a reward . 
 Rebirth uses the Tales series ' trademark Linear Motion Battle System ( LMBS ) , a real @-@ time fighting system similar to a beat ' em up . Up to four characters can be present in battle . The variation used in Rebirth is the Three @-@ Line LMBS , using a similar multi @-@ plain mechanic to Tales of Symphonia : characters can be moved across three different levels on the battlefield to either attack enemies on those lines or dodge behind an enemy on one line to deal damage from behind . During battle , a character can activate the Rush Gauge , increasing a character 's attack power at the cost of lowered defensive abilities and stats , and perform Mystic Artes ( <unk> , Hi <unk> ) with another member of the party to inflict high damage on single enemies . During battles , performing certain feats in battle , such as finishing in a certain time , rewards the player with a grade for their performance . 
 Special abilities and actions are controlled by the Force Gauge , an energy meter which determines how long special skills can be active . Once drained , the skill cannot be activated until the meter refills , which it does during battles . Four skills can be equipped for each character . After battles , characters earn Enhancement Points ( EP ) , which can be used to strengthen equipped armor , weapons and accessories , instead of using Gald ( the in @-@ game currency ) as with previous Tales titles . EP can be transferred between weapons . An optional battle arena was added in the PSP version of the game with both single @-@ player and multiplayer matches : in both modes , players need to defeat an enemy team ( either AI @-@ controlled enemies or an opposing team ) within a time limit .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Tales of Rebirth is set in a world where humans ( called Huma ) and beast people ( Gajuma ) coexist in relative peace . The world 's magical power is called Force , which manifests in various people as control over an element or aspect of the physical laws . In ancient times , after a war sparked when Huma attempted to enslave Gajuma , both races joined forces to found the kingdom of Karegia . An unspecified time before the events of the game , Geyorkias , the ruler of a spirit race called the Sacred Beasts , sought to destroy the Huma as their dark emotions were fueling a primordial destructive force known as Yuris : the other Sacred Beasts put a stop to Geyorkias ' plan by sealing him away , then acting to nullify Yuris ' threat . The story opens with the death of Karegia 's king , <unk> Lindblum , poisoned by the royal adviser Zilva Madigan : during his final moments , he releases his power into the world , causing many humans to become possessed by Force , including Veigue , Annie and Tytree .

 Tales of Rebirth was developed by Team Destiny , a section of Namco Tales Studio devoted to 2D Tales titles . It began production in 2003 . The development team , led by series producer Makoto Yoshizumi , was the same team behind Tales of Destiny 2 . Much of the technology from Destiny 2 was carried over to Rebirth . Mutsumi Inomata , a noted anime artist who had previously worked on Tales of Destiny , returned to design the main characters for Rebirth . She worked closely with Yoshizumi to create the designs , with each being representative of the characters ' backgrounds and experiences : for instance , Veigue 's clothing was made navy blue to emphasize his unsociable demeanor . Her Gajuma designs started with a basic human sketch , which was then embellished with animal features and faces . The majority of Rebirth 's story and script was written by Hiramatsu Masaki . The main theme was the issue of coexistence between different races , with the representation of the theme being the conflict between Huma and Gajuma . The Gajuma were created to heighten the sense of contrast for players . The game 's title " Rebirth " , was meant to represent the rebirth and reconstruction of harmonious relations between different peoples . Ethnic conflict , another prominent theme , was inspired by the predominant ethnic conflicts in Yugoslavia at the time the game was being made . Prior to the main script writing stage , Yoshizumi conceived the basic set @-@ up and story for the game . The final script ended up being substantially larger than that of Symphonia , covering four full script books . As with other Tales titles , Rebirth was given a characteristic genre name : the title was Kimi ga <unk> RPG ( <unk> ? , lit . RPG Where You Will Be Reborn ) . The game 's anime cutscenes were created by Production I.G. 
 Rebirth was officially announced in April 2004 , a week after the game 's title and existence had been leaked to the public early after a story from Jump magazine was made available a week early due to being mistakenly being shipped early . In July , Namco announced that people who pre @-@ ordered Tales of Symphonia for the PlayStation 2 would receive a bonus disc featuring footage from an early build of Tales of Rebirth , upon purchasing Symphonia in September . The same footage , along with a playable build of the game was present at the Tokyo Game Show in the same month . The game was released on the PlayStation 2 on December 16 , 2004 . In July 2004 , IGN reported that Tales of Rebirth was a likely candidate for an English localization in North America due to the high reception and sales of Tales of Symphonia in North America for the Nintendo GameCube . The PlayStation Portable port of the game , which featured graphical adjustments for the platform 's widescreen , was announced in July 2007 . The port was made following the port of Destiny 2 . As with those games , transplanting the 2D graphics onto the PSP and maintaining the experience of the original caused some difficulties . Conversely , they found the memory capacity of the PSP compared to the PS2 a good thing . Yoshizumi felt that the fact that it was a port rather than a remake divided the development team . The port also included extra minor story scenes and a viewing gallery for concept art . Neither the original nor the port of Rebirth have received an English localization , making it one of three mainline Tales titles not have come to the west .

 Rebirth 's soundtrack was composed by Motoi Sakuraba and Shinji Tamura , regular composers for the Tales series . The soundtrack was released as an album , Tales of Rebirth Original Soundtrack ( <unk> オブ リバース オリジナル ・ サウンドトラック ) , on January 26 , 2005 . Reception of the album has been mixed to positive . Patrick Gann of RPGFan said that fans of previous Tales soundtracks would enjoy it , though personally found it tiring due to similarity to previous Tales soundtracks . The reviewer for Game @-@ OST was generally positive , calling it one of the best albums of the series and better listening outside the context of the game than previous albums , though stated that despite some improvements , it did little to improve on previous Tales scores . As with previous Tales games , a licensed theme song was used for the opening . For Rebirth , the theme song used was " Good Night " , a 2004 single by Japanese pop band Every Little Thing . The song was released on 27 December 2004 , shortly after the game 's release , on a CD single also containing " Koibumi " ( <unk> , " Love Letter " ) . The single reached 1 # on the Oricon charts and remained in the charts for nineteen weeks .

The PSP port sold 46 @,@ 719 copies at release , reaching 6th place in the Japanese sales charts . The port went on to sell 83 @,@ 016 copies by the end of 2008 . Gaming magazine Famitsu received a score of 32 / 40 , with the four reviewers each giving it a score of 8 . The reviewers were generally positive about the gameplay , and one of them commented on enjoying the story . 
 Western gaming sites have also been very positive . Andrew Alfonso of IGN , reporting on the TGS 2004 demo , called the battle system " very fun " , and was generally impressed with the visual style with the exception of the world map . His main faults with the game were recurring issues with AI controls seen in previous games , but he made allowances for the fact that the version tested was a demo build . Anoop Gantayat , also writing for IGN when the game was released , was also impressed by the game , citing how quickly the game brought players into the action and how the battle mechanics had been improved over those in Destiny . GameSpy 's Heidi Kemps was favorably impressed by the game , but had reservations as to whether it could improve on Symphonia . Siliconera writer Rolando , writing after the announcement of the PSP port , praised the game 's ability to straddle the line between old and new , stating " this Tales really is a good Tales game that , while retaining a somewhat oldschool Tales charm , manages to reinvent the original formula and introduce a ton of good ideas that worked in your favor and made character customization fun . " RPGFan writer Zain was highly positive about the game : he cited the graphics is beautiful barring a few reservations about dungeons and the overworld map , praised the voice acting , and was generally positive about the story and characters . He also commented that the game was easier than previous Tales titles , and ended by calling it " one of the strongest games of this hardware generation , if not of all time . "

 Rebirth has been adapted into multiple media since its release . It inspired a five volume book series , released from February until November 2005 . Guidebooks and art books have also been released for the title . It also inspired a manga retelling of the story , published through 2005 . The comics were collected into two anthologies released on April 25 and May 27 , 2005 respectively . The story was also adapted into a CD audio drama series , released in four parts between October 2005 and February 2006 under the umbrella title Teiruzu Obu <unk> Dorama CD ( テイルズ オブ <unk> ? , lit . Tales of Rebirth Drama CD ) . To commemorate the PSP port , a new audio drama , titled <unk> DVD <unk> @-@ hen ( <unk> DVD <unk> ? , lit . Dramatic DVD Peach Pie Edition ) , was created .

 = Italian ironclad Regina Maria Pia = 
 Regina Maria Pia was the lead ship of the Regina Maria Pia class of ironclad warships built in French shipyards for the Italian Regia Marina in the 1860s . She and her three sister ships were broadside ironclads , mounting a battery of four 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and twenty @-@ two 164 mm ( 6 @.@ 5 in ) guns on the broadside . Regina Maria Pia was laid down in July 1862 , was launched in April 1863 , and was completed in April 1864 . 
 Regina Maria Pia took part in the Battle of Lissa during the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866 . She attacked the unarmored frigates in the Austrian second division , and damaged two vessels . Her career was limited after the war , owing to the emergence of more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa . She was rebuilt as a central battery ship some time after Lissa , and was modernized again in the late 1880s . Regina Maria Pia was eventually broken up for scrap in 1904 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Regina Maria Pia was 81 @.@ 2 meters ( 266 ft 5 in ) long overall ; she had a beam of 15 @.@ 24 m ( 50 ft 0 in ) and an average draft of 6 @.@ 35 m ( 20 ft 10 in ) . She displaced 4 @,@ 201 metric tons ( 4 @,@ 135 long tons ; 4 @,@ 631 short tons ) normally and up to 4 @,@ 527 t ( 4 @,@ 456 long tons ; 4 @,@ 990 short tons ) at full load . Regina Maria Pia was a broadside ironclad , and she was initially armed with a main battery of four 8 inches ( 203 mm ) guns and twenty @-@ two 164 millimeters ( 6 @.@ 5 in ) guns , though her armament changed throughout her career . The ship was protected by iron belt armor that was 4 @.@ 75 in ( 121 mm ) thick and extended for the entire length of the hull at the waterline . The battery deck was protected by 4 @.@ 3 in ( 109 mm ) of iron plate . She had a crew of 480 – 485 officers and men . 
 The ship 's propulsion system consisted of one single @-@ expansion steam engine that drove a single screw propeller , with steam supplied by six coal @-@ fired , rectangular boilers . Her engine produced a top speed of 12 @.@ 96 knots ( 24 @.@ 00 km / h ; 14 @.@ 91 mph ) from 2 @,@ 924 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 180 kW ) . She could steam for 2 @,@ 600 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 800 km ; 3 @,@ 000 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The ship was initially schooner @-@ rigged to supplement the steam engine , though her masts were later reduced to a barque rig . Ultimately , she lost her sailing rig completely , having it replaced with a pair of military masts with fighting tops . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Regina Maria Pia was built at the French shipyard Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée in La Seyne . Her keel was laid down on 22 July 1862 and her completed hull was launched on 28 April 1863 . The ship was completed on 17 April 1864 and delivered to the Italian fleet . In June 1866 , Italy declared war on Austria , as part of the Third Italian War of Independence , which was fought concurrently with the Austro @-@ Prussian War . The Italian fleet commander , Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano , initially adopted a cautious course of action ; he was unwilling to risk battle with the Austrian Navy , despite the fact that the Austrian fleet was much weaker than his own . Persano claimed he was simply waiting on the ironclad ram Affondatore , en route from Britain , but his inaction weakened morale in the fleet , with many of his subordinates openly accusing him of cowardice . 
 Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff brought the Austrian fleet to Ancona on June 27 , in an attempt to draw out the Italians . At the time , many of the Italian ships were in disarray ; several ships did not have their entire armament , and several others had problems with their engines . Regina Maria Pia was one of the few ironclads fit for action , so she , Castelfidardo , San Martino , and Principe di Carignano formed up to prepare to attack Tegetthoff 's ships . Persano held a council of war aboard Principe di Carignano to determine whether he should sortie to engage Tegetthoff , but by that time , the Austrians had withdrawn , making the decision moot . The Minister of the Navy , Agostino Depretis , urged Persano to act and suggested the island of Lissa , to restore Italian confidence after their defeat at the Battle of Custoza the previous month . On 7 July , Persano left Ancona and conducted a sweep into the Adriatic , but encountered no Austrian ships and returned on the 13th . 
 = = = Battle of Lissa = = = 
 On 16 July , Persano took the Italian fleet out of Ancona , bound for Lissa , where they arrived on the 18th . With them , they brought troop transports carrying 3 @,@ 000 soldiers ; the Italian warships began bombarding the Austrian forts on the island , with the intention of landing the soldiers once the fortresses had been silenced . In response , the Austrian Navy sent the fleet under Tegetthoff to attack the Italian ships . Regina Maria Pia was at that time in the 3rd Division , commanded by Captain Augusto Riboty , along with the ironclads Terribile , Formidabile , and Re di Portogallo , and the coastal defense ship Varese . After spending the 18th unsuccessfully bombarding the Austrian fortresses , the Italians withdrew late in the day , preparing to launch another attack the following morning . Persano sent most of his ships to bombard the town of Vis , but he was unable to effect the landing . 
 The next morning , Persano ordered another attack ; four ironclads would force the harbor defenses at Vis while Regina Maria Pia and the rest of the fleet would attempt to suppress the outer fortifications . This second attack also proved to be a failure , but Persano decided to make a third attempt the next day . Regina Maria Pia and the bulk of the fleet would again try to disable the outer forts in preparation for the landing . Before the Italians could begin the attack , the dispatch boat Esploratore arrived , bringing news of Tegetthoff 's approach . Persano 's fleet was in disarray ; the three ships of Admiral Giovanni Vacca 's 1st Division were three miles to the northeast from Persano 's main force , and three other ironclads were further away to the west . Persano immediately ordered his ships to form up with Vacca 's , first in line abreast formation , and then in line ahead formation . Regina Maria Pia initially was the last ship in the line , though Varese later joined up behind her . 
 Shortly before the action began , Persano decided to leave his flagship Re d 'Italia and transfer to Affondatore , though none of his subordinates on the other ships were aware of the change . They were thus left to fight as individuals without direction . More dangerously , by stopping Re d 'Italia , he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca 's three ships and the rest of the fleet . Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca 's and Persano 's ships , in an attempt to split the Italian line and initiate a melee . He failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass , so he turned back toward Persano 's ships , and took Re d 'Italia , San Martino , and Palestro under heavy fire . The Austrians quickly inflicted serious damage on Re d 'Italia and Palestro . While Tegetthoff 's ironclads were attacking Persano 's division , Riboty 's division , including Regina Maria Pia , engaged Anton von Petz 's division of unarmored steam frigates . In the melee , Regina Maria Pia collided with San Martino , damaging the latter 's ram bow . 
 After Palestro withdrew , the Austrian ironclads turned their attention to the ships of Riboty 's division . By this time , Re d 'Italia had been rammed and sunk , and Palestro was burning furiously . Persano broke off the engagement to consolidate his forces , but his ships , low on coal and ammunition , and with badly demoralized crews , could not be rallied by Persano 's half @-@ hearted attempt to launch an attack . The Italian fleet began to withdraw , followed by the Austrians ; as night began to fall , the opposing fleets disengaged completely , heading for Ancona and Pola , respectively . Regina Maria Pia had had one iron plate destroyed , and another had a steel shot lodged in it . She had been badly burned , and the flames had nearly reached her powder magazine . In return , she had damaged the Austrian ship of the line SMS Kaiser and the ironclad Prinz Eugen . After the battle , Vacca replaced Persano ; he was ordered to attack the main Austrian naval base at Pola , but the war ended before the operation could be carried out . 
 = = = Later career = = = 
 For the rest of her long career , Regina Maria Pia served in a variety of roles , both in the main fleet and in Italy 's colonial empire . In the immediate aftermath of the war , the Italian naval budget was drastically reduced ; so significant were the cuts that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of Civitavecchia in September 1870 , as part of the wars of Italian unification . Instead , the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home . Some time after 1866 , the ship was rebuilt as a central battery ship , with most of her guns located in a central , armored casemate . Two other guns were placed in the bow as chase guns , with a third mounted as a stern chaser . At this time , her armament was also revised , to two 220 mm ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) guns in the bow and nine 8 in guns , four on each broadside and the last in the stern . 
 Regina Maria Pia took part in the launching ceremony for the ironclad Italia on 29 September 1880 ; also present were the Italian ironclad Principe Amedeo and King Umberto I aboard his yacht , and the British ironclads HMS Monarch and Thunderer with Vice Admiral George Tryon , both members of the Mediterranean Fleet . Between 1888 and 1890 , the ship had her barque rig replaced with military masts . By this time , she had been rearmed with eight 6 in ( 150 mm ) guns in the casemate and several smaller guns for close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats . These included five 4 @.@ 7 in ( 120 mm ) guns , four 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) guns , and eight 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss revolver cannon . She also received three torpedo tubes . The ship was stricken from the naval register in 1904 and subsequently broken up for scrap . 
 = 1877 Wimbledon Championship = 
 The 1877 Wimbledon Championship was a men 's tennis tournament held at the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club ( AEC & LTC ) in Wimbledon , London . It was the world 's first official lawn tennis tournament , and was later recognised as the first Grand Slam tournament or " Major " . The AEC & LTC had been founded in July 1868 , as the All England Croquet Club ; lawn tennis was introduced in February 1875 to compensate for the waning interest in croquet . In June 1877 the club decided to organise a tennis tournament to pay for the repair of its pony roller , needed to maintain the lawns . A set of rules was drawn up for the tournament , derived from the first standardised rules of tennis issued by the Marylebone Cricket Club in May 1875 . 
 The Gentlemen 's Singles competition , the only event of the championship , was contested on grass courts by 22 players who each paid one guinea to participate . The tournament started on 9 July 1877 , and the final – delayed for three days by rain – was played on 19 July in front of a crowd of about 200 people who each paid an entry fee of one shilling . The winner received 12 guineas in prize money and a silver challenge cup , valued at 25 guineas , donated by the sports magazine The Field . Spencer Gore , a 27 @-@ year @-@ old rackets player from Wandsworth , became the first Wimbledon champion by defeating William Marshall , a 28 @-@ year @-@ old real tennis player , in three straight sets in a final that lasted 48 minutes . The tournament made a profit of £ 10 and the pony roller remained in use . An analysis made after the tournament led to some modifications of the rules regarding the court dimensions . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Origins of lawn tennis = = = 
 The origin of tennis lies in the monastic cloisters in 12th @-@ century France , where the ball was struck with the palm of the hand in a game called jeu de paume . Rackets were introduced to the game in the early 16th century . This original version of tennis , now called " real tennis " , was mostly played indoors and popular among the royalty and gentry , while a crude outdoor version called longue paume was played by the populace . The prominence of the game declined in the 17th and 18th centuries , although there are sporadic mentions of a " long tennis " or " field tennis " version in the second half of the 18th century . 
 Between 1858 and 1873 several people in Victorian England experimented with a lawn version of tennis . Major Harry Gem and <unk> Perera demonstrated their game of <unk> ( Spanish for ball ) and in 1872 created the world 's first lawn tennis club at Leamington Spa . In February 1874 Major Clopton Wingfield introduced his version of lawn tennis , called Sphairistikè ; on his patent application , he described it as a " New and Improved Court for Playing the Ancient Game of Tennis " , and its rules were published in an eight @-@ page booklet . Wingfield is widely credited with popularising the new game through his energetic promotional efforts . The Sphairistikè court was hourglass @-@ shaped , wider at the baseline than at the net . The service was made from a single side in a lozenge shaped box situated in the middle of the court and it had to bounce beyond the service line . In November 1874 Wingfield published a second , expanded edition of The Book of the Game , which had 12 rules and featured a larger court and a slightly lower net . 
 = = = All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club = = = 
 The All England Croquet Club was founded on 23 July 1868 by six gentlemen at the offices of The Field , a weekly country and sports magazine . After a yearlong search a suitable ground of four acres of meadowland was located between the London and South Western Railway and Worple Road in Wimbledon , then an outer suburb of London . The club 's committee decided on 24 September 1869 to lease the ground and paid £ 50 rental for the first year , a fee which increased to £ 75 and £ 100 , respectively , over the following two years . The increasing rent , coupled with a waning interest in the sedate sport of croquet , was causing the club financial difficulties . In February 1875 it decided to introduce lawn tennis at its grounds to capitalise on the growing interest in this new sport and generate additional revenue . The proposal was made by Henry Jones , a sports writer who published extensively in The Field under his nom de plume " Cavendish " and who had joined the club in 1869 . The introduction of lawn tennis was approved at the annual meeting and the club 's membership fee was set at two guineas to cover both sports . At a cost of £ 25 , one croquet lawn was converted to a tennis court ; soon after its completion on 25 February 1875 , a dozen new club members joined . In 1876 four more lawns , a third of the ground , were handed over to lawn tennis to address the increase in new members . A committee member , George Nicol , was appointed to deal exclusively with lawn tennis affairs . Lawn tennis had become so popular that on 14 April 1877 the name of the club was formally changed , at the suggestion of founding member John H. Hale , to the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club ( AEC & LTC ) . 
 = = = Rules of lawn tennis = = = 
 On 3 March 1875 the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) , in its capacity as the governing body for rackets and real tennis , convened a meeting at Lord 's Cricket Ground to test the various versions of lawn tennis with the aim to standardise the game 's rules . Wingfield was present to demonstrate Sphairistikè , as was John H. Hale , who presented his version called <unk> Lawn Tennis ; there is no record of either Gem or Perera being present to showcase <unk> . After the meeting , the MCC Tennis Committee was tasked with framing the rules . On 29 May 1875 the MCC issued the Laws of Lawn Tennis , the first unified rules for lawn tennis , which were adopted by the club on 24 June . These were significantly based on the rules introduced by Wingfield in February 1874 and published in his rule @-@ booklet titled Sphairistikè or Lawn Tennis . The MCC adopted Wingfield 's hourglass @-@ shaped court as well as the rackets method of scoring , in which the player who first scores 15 points wins the game and only the server ( " hand @-@ in " ) was able to score . The height of the net was set at 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 52 m ) at the posts and 4 ft ( 1 @.@ 22 m ) in the centre . Various aspects of these rules , including the characteristic court shape and the method of scoring , were the subject of prolonged debate in the press . The MCC rules were not universally adhered to following its publication and , among others , the Prince 's Club in London stuck to playing on rectangular courts .

 On 2 June 1877 , at the suggestion of the All England Club secretary and founding member John H. Walsh , the club committee decided to organise a lawn tennis championship for amateurs , a Gentlemen 's Singles event , which they hoped would generate enough funds to repair the broken pony roller that was needed for the maintenance of the lawns . This championship became the world 's first official lawn tennis tournament , and the first edition of what would later be called a Grand Slam tournament ( or " Major " ) . The committee agreed to hold the tournament on the condition that it would not endanger the club 's limited funds ; to ensure this , Henry Jones persuaded 20 members and friends of the club to guarantee a part of the tournament 's financial requirement and made himself responsible for the remaining amount . Jones investigated all potential tournament locations in and around London but came to the conclusion that no other ground was more suitable than the Wimbledon premises at Worple Road . As a consequence , the remaining croquet lawns were converted to tennis courts .

 The first public announcement of the tournament was published on 9 June 1877 in The Field magazine under the header Lawn Tennis Championship : 
 The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club , Wimbledon , propose to hold a lawn tennis meeting , open to all amateurs , on Monday , July 9th and following days . Entrance fee , £ 1 1s 0d . Names and addresses of competitors to be forwarded to the Hon. Sec . A.E.C. and <unk> before Saturday , July 7 , or on that day before 2 @.@ 15 p.m. at the club ground , Wimbledon . Two prizes will be given – one gold champion prize to the winner , one silver to the second player . The value of the prizes will depend on the number of entries , and will be declared before the draw ; but in no case will they be less than the amount of the entrance money , and if there are ten and less than sixteen entries , they will be made up to £ 10 10s and £ 5 5s respectively . – Henry Jones – Hon Sec of the Lawn Tennis sub @-@ committee 
 Players were instructed to provide their own racquets and wear shoes without heels . The announcement also stated that a programme would be available shortly with further details , including the rules to be adopted for the meeting . Invitations were sent to prospective participants . Potential visitors were informed that those arriving by horse and carriage should use the entrance at Worple Road while those who planned to come by foot were advised to use the railway path . Upon payment of the entrance fee , the participants were allowed to practise before the Championship on the twelve available courts with the provision that on Saturdays and during the croquet championship week , held the week before the tennis tournament , the croquet players had the first choice of courts . Practice balls , similar to the ones used for the tournament , were available from the club 's gardener at a price of 12s per dozen balls . John H. Walsh , in his capacity as editor of The Field , persuaded his employer to donate a cup worth 25 guineas for the winner ; the Field Cup The cup was made of sterling silver and had the inscription : The All England Lawn Challenge Cup – Presented by the Proprietors of The Field – For competition by Amateurs – Wimbledon July 1877 . On 6 July 1877 , three days prior to the start of the tournament , a notice was published in The Times : 
 Next week at the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club Ground a Lawn Tennis Championship Meeting will be held . The ground is situated close to the Wimbledon Station on the South Western Railway , and is sufficiently large for the erection of thirty " courts " . On each day the competition will begin at 3 @.@ 30 , the first ties , of course , beginning on Monday . The Hon. <unk> of the meeting is Mr. J.H. Walsh , while Mr. H. Jones will officiate as referee . The entries are numerous .

 The committee of the club was not satisfied with certain aspects of the 1875 MCC unified rules . To address these perceived shortcomings , a sub @-@ committee consisting of Charles Gilbert Heathcote , Julian Marshall and Henry Jones was set up on 2 June 1877 , to establish the rules applicable for the upcoming tournament . They reported back on 7 June with a new set of rules , derived but significantly different from those published by the MCC ; in order not to offend the MCC , these rules were declared " provisional " and valid only for the championship : 
 The court will have a rectangular shape with outer dimensions of 78 by 27 feet ( 23 @.@ 8 by 8 @.@ 2 m ) . 
 The net will be lowered to 3 feet 3 inches ( 0 @.@ 99 m ) in the centre . 
 The balls will be 2 1 ⁄ 2 to 2 5 ⁄ 8 inches ( 6 @.@ 4 to 6 @.@ 7 cm ) in diameter and 1 3 ⁄ 4 ounces ( 50 g ) in weight . 
 The real tennis method of scoring by <unk> ( 15 , 30 , 40 ) will be adopted . 
 The first player to win six games wins the set with ' sudden death ' occurring at five games all except for the final , when a lead of two games in each set is necessary . 
 Players will change ends at the end of a set unless otherwise decreed by the umpire . 
 The server will have two chances at each point to deliver a correct service and must have one foot behind the baseline . 
 These rules , drawn up by the club for this initial tournament , were eventually adopted for the entire sport and , with only slight modifications , have retained their validity . All matches during the tournament were played as best @-@ of @-@ five sets . 
 = = = Play = = = 
 In accordance with the All England Regulations for the Management of Prize Meetings , the draw for the 22 entrants was made on Saturday , 7 July 1877 , at 3 : 30 p.m. in the club 's pavilion . H.T. Gillson had the distinction of being the first player in the history of modern tennis to be drawn for a tournament . The posts , nets and hand @-@ stitched , flannel @-@ covered India @-@ rubber balls for the tournament were supplied by Jefferies & Co from Woolwich , while the rackets used were an adaptation of those used in real tennis , with a small and slightly lopsided head . The ball @-@ boys kept the tennis balls , 180 of which were used during the tournament , in canvas wells . The umpires who were provided for the matches sat on chairs which in turn were placed on small tables of 18 inches height to give them a better view of the court . 
 The tournament began on Monday , 9 July 1877 , at 3 : 30 p.m. and daily programmes were available for sixpence . On the first day , in sunny weather , ten matches were played , which completed the first round . Full match scores were published on the notice board inside the pavilion . F.N. Langham , a Cambridge tennis blue , was given a walkover in the first round when C.F. Buller , an Etonian and well @-@ known rackets player , did not appear . Julian Marshall became the first player to win a five @-@ set match when he fought back from being two sets down against Captain Grimston . Spencer Gore , a 27 @-@ year @-@ old rackets player from Wandsworth and at the time a land agent and surveyor by profession , won his first round match against Henry Thomas Gillson in straight sets . The five second @-@ round matches were played on Tuesday , 10 July , again in fine weather . Charles Gilbert Heathcote had a bye in the second round . J. Lambert became the first player in Wimbledon Championships ' history to retire a match , conceding to L.R. Erskine after losing the first two sets . Julian Marshall again won a five @-@ set match , this time against F.W. Oliver , while Gore defeated Montague Hankey in four sets . 
 The quarter @-@ finals were played on Wednesday , 11 July , before a larger number of spectators than had attended the previous matches . Start of play was delayed from the scheduled 3 : 30 p.m. due to strong winds . Gore defeated Langham in four sets , William Marshall beat Erskine , also in four sets , and Julian Marshall , who injured his knee during the match after a fall , lost to Heathcote in straight sets . The quarter @-@ final matches left three players , instead of four , in the draw for the semi @-@ finals scheduled for Thursday . To solve the situation lots were drawn and Marshall , a 28 @-@ year @-@ old architect and Cambridge real tennis blue , was given a bye to the final . His opponent would be Gore , who defeated Heathcote in straight sets in the only semi @-@ final played . When the semi @-@ final stage had concluded on Thursday , 12 July , play was suspended until next Monday , 16 July , to avoid a clash with the popular annual Eton v Harrow cricket match that was played at Lord 's on Friday and Saturday . 
 The final was postponed from its scheduled start on Monday at 4 p.m. until Thursday , 19 July , at 3 : 30 p.m. because of rain . On Thursday it was still showery , causing the final to be further delayed by an hour . It began on a dead and slippery court in front of about 200 spectators . There was a temporary three @-@ plank stand on one side of the court offering seating to about thirty people . Marshall won the toss , elected to serve first and was immediately broken by Gore . After the first set was won by Gore , it started to rain for a quarter of an hour ; this further softened the ground and affected the quality of play . The final lasted 48 minutes , and Spencer Gore won the inaugural championship against William Marshall in three straight sets of 15 , 13 , and 20 minutes respectively . En route to the title Gore had won 15 sets and lost two and won 99 games for the loss of 46 . Gore , the volley specialist , had beaten the baseline player , at a time when volleying was considered by some to be unsporting . Some tried to outlaw the volley and a discussion on its merits took place in The Field for weeks after the tournament . 
 The final was followed by a play @-@ off match for 2nd place between Marshall and Heathcote . The players could not fix another date for the match and decided to play it straight away . By agreement , the match was limited to best @-@ of @-@ three sets . Marshall , playing his second match of the day , defeated Heathcote in straight sets , in front of a diminished crowd , and won the silver prize of seven guineas . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On 20 July 1877 , the day following the final , a report was published in The Morning Post newspaper : 
 Lawn Tennis Championship – A fair number of spectators assembled yesterday , notwithstanding the rain , on the beautifully kept ground of the All England Club , Wimbledon , to witness the final contest between Messrs. Spencer Gore and W. Marshall for the championship . The play on both sides was of the highest order and its exhibition afforded a great treat to lovers of the game . All three sets were won buy Mr. Gore , who , therefore , becomes lawn tennis champion for 1877 , and wins the £ 12 <unk> gold prize and holds the silver challenge cup , value £ 25 5s . The second and third prizes were then played for by Messrs. W. Marshall and G.C. Heathcote ( best of three sets by agreement ) . Mr. Marshall won two sets to love , and therefore takes the silver prize ( value £ 12 12s . ) . Mr. Heathcote takes the third prize , value £ 3 3s . 
 A report in The Field stated : " The result was a more easy victory for Mr Spencer Gore than had been expected . " . Third @-@ placed Heathcote said that Gore was the best player of the year and had a varied service with a lot of twist on it . Gore , according to Heathcote , was a player with an aptitude for many games and had a long reach and a strong and flexible wrist . His volleying style was novel at the time , a forceful shot instead of merely a pat back over the net . All the opponents who were defeated by Gore on his way to the title were real tennis players . His victory was therefore regarded as a win of the rackets style of play over the real tennis style , and of the offensive style of the volley player – who comes to the net to force the point , over the baseline player – who plays groundstrokes from the back of the court , intent on keeping the ball in play . His volleying game was also successful because the height of the net at the post – 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 52 m ) in contrast to the modern height of 3 ft 6 in ( 1 @.@ 07 m ) – made it difficult for his opponents to pass him by driving the ball down the line . Gore indicated that the real tennis players had the tendency to play shots from corner to corner over the middle of the net and did so at such a height that made volleying easy . 
 Despite his historic championship title , Gore was not enthusiastic about the new sport of lawn tennis . In 1890 , thirteen years after winning his championship title , he wrote : " ... it is want of variety that will prevent lawn tennis in its present form from taking rank among our great games ... That anyone who has really played well at cricket , tennis , or even rackets , will ever seriously give his attention to lawn tennis , beyond showing himself to be a promising player , is extremely doubtful ; for in all probability the monotony of the game as compared with others would choke him off before he had time to excel in it . " He did return for the 1878 Championship to defend his title in the Challenge Round but lost in straight sets to Frank Hadow , a coffee planter from Ceylon , who effectively used the lob to counter Gore 's net play . It was Gore 's last appearance at the Wimbledon Championships . 
 = = = Analysis and rules changes = = = 
 The tournament generated a profit of £ 10 and the pony roller stayed in use . When the tournament was finished , Henry Jones gathered all the score cards to analyse the results and found that , of the 601 games played during the tournament , 376 were won by the server ( " striker @-@ in " ) and 225 by the receiver ( " striker @-@ out " ) . At a time when the service was either made underarm or , usually , at shoulder height , this was seen as a serving dominance and resulted in a modification of the rules for the 1878 Championship . To decrease the target area for the server , the length of the service court was reduced from 26 to 22 ft ( 7 @.@ 92 to 6 @.@ 71 m ) and to make passing shots easier against volleyers the height of the net was reduced to 4 ft 9 in ( 1 @.@ 45 m ) at the posts and 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) at the centre . These rules were published jointly by the AEC & LTC and the MCC , giving the AEC & LTC an official rule @-@ making authority and in effect retroactively sanctioning its 1877 rules . It marked the moment when the AEC & LTC effectively usurped the rule @-@ making initiative from the MCC although the latter would still ratify rule changes until 1882 . In recognition of the importance and popularity of lawn tennis , the club was renamed in 1882 to All England Lawn Tennis Club ( <unk> ) .

 Derek Walsh Webb ( born May 27 , 1974 ) is an American singer @-@ songwriter who first entered the music industry as a member of the band Caedmon 's Call , and later embarked on a successful solo career . As a member of the Houston , Texas @-@ based Caedmon ’ s Call , Webb has seen career sales approaching 1 million records , along with 10 GMA Dove Award nominations and three Dove Award wins and six No. 1 Christian radio hits . 
 In 2003 , Webb left Caedmon 's Call to pursue a solo career . Since his departure , he has released seven studio albums ( including one instrumental ) , a live album , two compilation albums , two covers projects , two DVDs , and two EPs ( with his then @-@ wife , Sandra McCracken ) . While these have been less commercially successful than his work with Caedmon 's Call , Webb has had more of a free hand to shape his work to his vision . 
 His latest album , I Was Wrong , I 'm Sorry & I Love You , was released on September 3 , 2013 . 
 On April 17 , 2014 , Webb and his wife , fellow singer @-@ songwriter Sandra McCracken , announced that their marriage was coming to an end after thirteen years due to Webb 's involvement in an extramarital affair .

 Webb 's mother , a gifted classically trained pianist , encouraged his musical interests at a very young age . Music came naturally to him , and he began to play the guitar at six years old . Concerning his musical training , Webb explains that he got his ear for music from his mother , but not the ability to read music , and that he " took one [ guitar ] lesson and then just taught myself out of the book . " While in high school , he became known for his skill on the guitar . He toured with a band , though it broke up in his junior year following a serious car accident returning from playing a show at Baylor University . Webb graduated from Klein High School in Klein , Texas in 1992 . Before joining Caedmon 's Call , he went to community college in Houston for half a semester , and shared an apartment with his older brother who was attending medical school .

 Caedmon 's Call was formed in 1993 with four original members ( three of whom still remain ) , Cliff Young , Danielle Glenn , Todd Bragg , and Aaron Tate . Aaron Tate , however , never intended to tour with the band , and was included in a songwriting capacity only , sharing those duties with Derek Webb who also played lead guitar . 
 Webb 's invitation to join Caedmon 's Call came from Tate , who at the time was attending Texas Christian University in Fort Worth , TX . Shortly afterward , Webb made the trip to Fort Worth and met future band mate Cliff Young . Webb says , " I essentially just joined that band immediately . And as soon as I joined the band , I quit college the same day . " As a result , for almost a full school year he pretended to go to class , with his family unaware he was actually pursuing the band in lieu of going to school . 
 In June 1994 , the band released their first album , My Calm / / Your Storm , originally a cassette @-@ only demo recording . It was re @-@ printed twice the same year with different cover art each time . In 1996 the band signed with now @-@ defunct Christian label Warner Alliance , producing their self @-@ titled release . Peaking at 110 on the Billboard 200 , the album went on to win the GMA 1998 Modern Rock Album of the Year . 
 After the collapse of Warner Alliance in 1998 , Caedmon 's Call signed to Essential Records , where they released 40 Acres ( 1999 ) , Long Line of <unk> ( 2000 ) , In the Company of Angels : A Call to Worship ( 2001 ) , Back Home ( 2003 ) . All of these albums were moderately successful , peaking at 61 , 58 , 72 , and 66 respectively on the Billboard 200 . Notably , Webb did not provide any songwriting for In the Company of Angels or Back Home , despite having been a primary songwriter for the band prior to their release . During this time period , Webb also contributed to City on a Hill : Songs of Worship and Praise ( 2000 ) and City on a Hill : Sing Alleluia ( 2002 ) , both as a member of Caedmon 's Call and as a solo artist , which respectively garnered the GMA 2001 & 2003 Special Event Album of the Year awards . 
 In 2001 , Webb left the band to pursue his solo career , although he continued to contribute to their next album Back Home . Caedmon 's Call then released Chronicles 1992 @-@ 2004 ( 2004 ) , a best @-@ of collection of the band 's work , which included work by Webb . In 2007 , Caedmon 's Call signed onto INO Records , and Webb was featured as singer and songwriter on the album , <unk> . He continued to be involved with the band as producer on the 2011 album Raising Up The Dead . 
 Webb has considered himself a solo act since 2001 , but admits his continued collaboration with the band can make it seem like he never left , saying " Caedmon ’ s Call , as it turns out , is very much like hotel <unk> : you can check out anytime you ’ d like , but you can never really leave . " 
 On May 22 , 2007 , it was announced that Webb had again worked with Caedmon 's Call , writing and recording for their album , entitled <unk> , and would be joining the band on their subsequent tour . 
 = = Solo career = = 
 His first solo album , She Must and Shall Go Free ( 2003 ) is notable for causing controversy in Contemporary Christian Music circles ; some Christian retailers refused to stock the album for its use of " strong " language . 
 One of the songs that was the basis for controversy was Wedding Dress where Webb compares Christians who seek fulfillment in things outside of Christ to a person committing adultery . An introspective tune , Webb writes that " I am a whore I do confess / I put you on just like a wedding dress " . 
 Another song that generated controversy was Saint and Sinner where Webb wrote " I used to be a damned mess but now I look just fine , ' Cause you dressed me up and we drank the finest wine " . The word ' damned ' was removed from the final version of the album , at the request of two major Christian retailers . 
 Following the release of She Must and Shall Go Free , Webb embarked on a national tour in which he played his concerts in the living rooms of fans . This provided the opportunity to have greater interaction with his listeners . He went on to release a live album from his " House Tour " , entitled The House Show ( 2004 ) . 
 His second solo studio record , I See Things Upside Down ( 2004 ) , generated mixed reviews . All marketing to the typical Christian music stations used by his first solo album and his albums with Caedmon 's Call was stopped , though the album still has explicitly Christian lyrics . In comparison to Webb 's previous work , this album has what 's been referred to as an " experimental " style to it , and has been compared to the music of Wilco in that respect . Webb has stated that the album " was doing away with people 's expectations in order to free me up to do what I wanted . " Following the release of I See Things Upside Down , Webb released a live concert DVD , How to Kill and Be Killed ( 2005 ) . 
 His third studio album , titled Mockingbird ( 2005 ) , was released on December 26 , 2005 . The album touches on subjects such as politics , social justice , and war . Webb has stated that he tackled these subjects to stimulate discussion and engage people to bring about changes in what he sees as some of the greatest problems the world is facing today . In order to broaden this discussion to people less inclined to purchase his album , beginning September 1 , 2006 , Webb offered Mockingbird for free on the website Free Derek Webb ( no longer exists ) , where it was available for download until December 8 , 2006 . Over 80 @,@ 000 free copies of the album were downloaded during this time . 
 On January 30 , 2007 , Webb released two EPs , each containing the same ten songs from earlier in his solo career , including pieces from each of his three solo studio albums . One Zero ( Acoustic ) , contains acoustic reinterpretations of the songs , and is available in stores only . One Zero ( Remix ) makes use of the original recording sessions for each of the songs , but has been remixed by engineer Will Hunt . This more experimental record is available only online . 
 Webb 's next project , The Ringing Bell was released on May 1 , 2007 . Before the release date , it was available for pre @-@ order at <unk> in a deluxe edition which included a 96 @-@ page graphic novel inspired by the album . Those who pre @-@ ordered the deluxe edition of the album were also able to immediately download it in its entirety . 
 On May 12 , 2009 , Webb sent a message to his email mailing list stating that his next album Stockholm Syndrome was deemed too controversial for his record label to release . " It seems I 've finally found the line beyond which my label can support me , and apparently I 've crossed it , " Webb writes . " [ A ] t this point we 're not sure when the record will come out and in what form . The majority of the controversy is surrounding one song , which I consider to be among the most important songs on the record … . [ B ] ecause of various legal / publishing issues we 're having to be rather careful with how we do what we 're going to do next . " . 
 Derek 's solo release Stockholm Syndrome was released on his website , <unk> , on July 7 , 2009 as a digital release . He has also made physical copies of both the edited and unedited versions of the CD available by September 1 , 2009 . 
 In late 2011 Derek Webb collaborated on the soundtrack for the motion picture Nexus . 
 On September 3 , 2013 , Webb released I Was Wrong , I 'm Sorry & I Love You . The album is written as a reflective look back at his 20 years in music as well as 10 years since his first solo release .

 While on tour , Webb noticed that attendance at his shows had increased dramatically after he had made Mockingbird available for free online . Inspired by that realization , Webb helped form <unk> , a website that allows users to download music for free from independent musicians .

 = Seneca Falls Convention = 
 The Seneca Falls Convention was the first women 's rights convention . It advertised itself as " a convention to discuss the social , civil , and religious condition and rights of woman " . Held in Seneca Falls , New York , it spanned two days over July 19 – 20 , 1848 . Attracting widespread attention , it was soon followed by other women 's rights conventions , including one in Rochester , New York , two weeks later . In 1850 the first in a series of annual National Women 's Rights Conventions met in Worcester , Massachusetts . 
 Female Quakers local to the area organized the meeting along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton , who was not a Quaker . They planned the event during a visit to the area by Philadelphia @-@ based Lucretia Mott . Mott , a Quaker , was famous for her oratorical ability , which was rare during an era in which women were often not allowed to speak in public . 
 The meeting comprised six sessions including a lecture on law , a humorous presentation , and multiple discussions about the role of women in society . Stanton and the Quaker women presented two prepared documents , the Declaration of Sentiments and an accompanying list of resolutions , to be debated and modified before being put forward for signatures . A heated debate sprang up regarding women 's right to vote , with many – including Mott – urging the removal of this concept , but Frederick Douglass , who was the convention 's sole African American attendee , argued eloquently for its inclusion , and the suffrage resolution was retained . Exactly 100 of approximately 300 attendees signed the document , mostly women . 
 The convention was seen by some of its contemporaries , including featured speaker Mott , as one important step among many others in the continuing effort by women to gain for themselves a greater proportion of social , civil and moral rights , while it was viewed by others as a revolutionary beginning to the struggle by women for complete equality with men . Stanton considered the Seneca Falls Convention to be the beginning of the women 's rights movement , an opinion that was echoed in the History of Woman Suffrage , which Stanton co @-@ wrote . 
 The convention 's Declaration of Sentiments became " the single most important factor in spreading news of the women 's rights movement around the country in 1848 and into the future " , according to Judith Wellman , a historian of the convention . By the time of the National Women 's Rights Convention of 1851 , the issue of women 's right to vote had become a central tenet of the United States women 's rights movement . These conventions became annual events until the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 .

 In the decades leading up to 1848 , a small number of women began to push against restrictions imposed upon them by society . A few men aided in this effort . In 1831 , Reverend Charles Grandison Finney began allowing women to pray aloud in gatherings of men and women . The Second Great Awakening was challenging women 's traditional roles in religion . Recalling the era in 1870 , Paulina Wright Davis set Finney 's decision as the beginning of the American women 's reform movement . 
 = = = Abolitionism = = = 
 Starting in 1832 , abolitionist and journalist William Lloyd Garrison organized anti @-@ slavery associations which encouraged the full participation of women . Garrison 's ideas were not welcomed by a majority of other abolitionists , and those unwilling to include women split from him to form other abolitionist societies . 
 A few women began to gain fame as writers and speakers on the subject of abolition . In the 1830s , Lydia Maria Child wrote to encourage women to write a will , and Frances Wright wrote books on women 's rights and social reform . The Grimké sisters published their views against slavery in the late 1830s , and they began speaking to mixed gatherings of men and women for Garrison 's American Anti @-@ Slavery Society , as did Abby Kelley . Although these women lectured primarily on the evils of slavery , the fact that a woman was speaking in public was itself a noteworthy stand for the cause of women 's rights . Ernestine Rose began lecturing in 1836 to groups of women on the subject of the " Science of Government " which included the enfranchisement of women . 
 In 1840 , at the urging of Garrison and Wendell Phillips , Lucretia Coffin Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton traveled with their husbands and a dozen other American male and female abolitionists to London for the first World 's Anti @-@ Slavery Convention , with the expectation that a motion put forward by Phillips to include women 's participation in the convention would be controversial . In London , the proposal was rebuffed after a full day of debate ; the women were allowed to listen from the gallery but not allowed to speak or vote . Mott and Stanton became friends in London and on the return voyage , and together planned to organize their own convention to further the cause of women 's rights , separate from abolition concerns . In 1842 Thomas M 'Clintock and his wife Mary Ann became founding members of the Western New York Anti @-@ Slavery Society and helped write its constitution . When he moved to Rochester in 1847 , Frederick Douglass joined Amy and Isaac Post and the M 'Clintocks in this Rochester @-@ based chapter of the American Anti @-@ Slavery Society . 
 = = = Women 's rights = = = 
 In 1839 in Boston , Margaret Fuller began hosting conversations , akin to French salons , among women interested in discussing the " great questions " facing their sex . Sophia Ripley was one of the participants . In 1845 , Fuller published The Great Lawsuit , asking women to claim themselves as self @-@ dependent . 
 In the 1840s , women in America were reaching out for greater control of their lives . Husbands and fathers directed the lives of women , and many doors were closed to female participation . State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property , signing contracts , serving on juries and voting in elections . Women 's prospects in employment were dim : they could expect only to gain a very few service @-@ related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work . In Massachusetts , Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 as an attempt to find a way in which men and women could work together , with women receiving the same compensation as men . The experiment failed . 
 In the fall of 1841 , Elizabeth Cady Stanton gave her first public speech , on the subject of the Temperance movement , in front of 100 women in Seneca Falls . She wrote to her friend Elizabeth J. Neal that she moved both the audience and herself to tears , saying " I infused into my speech an Homeopathic dose of woman 's rights , as I take good care to do in many private conversations . " 
 Lucretia Mott met with Elizabeth Cady Stanton in Boston in 1842 , and discussed again the possibility of a woman 's rights convention . They talked once more in 1847 , prior to Stanton moving from Boston to Seneca Falls . 
 Women 's groups led by Lucretia Mott and Paulina Wright Davis held public meetings in Philadelphia beginning in 1846 . A wide circle of abolitionists friendly to women 's rights began in 1847 to discuss the possibility of holding a convention wholly devoted to women 's rights . In October 1847 , Lucy Stone gave her first public speech on the subject of women 's rights , entitled The Province of Women , at her brother Bowman Stone 's church in Gardner , Massachusetts . 
 In March 1848 , Garrison , the Motts , Abby Kelley Foster , Stephen Symonds Foster and others hosted an Anti @-@ Sabbath meeting in Boston , to work toward the elimination of laws that apply only to Sunday , and to gain for the laborer more time away from toil than just one day of rest per week . Lucretia Mott and two other women were active within the executive committee , and Mott spoke to the assemblage . Lucretia Mott raised questions about the validity of blindly following religious and social tradition .

 On April 7 , 1848 , in response to a citizen 's petition , the New York State Assembly passed the Married Woman 's Property Act , giving women the right to retain property they brought into a marriage , as well as property they acquired during the marriage . Creditors could not seize a wife 's property to pay a husband 's debts . Leading up to the passage of this law , in 1846 , supporters issued a pamphlet , probably authored by Judge John Fine , which relied on its readers ' familiarity with the United States Declaration of Independence to demand " That all are created free and equal ... " , and that this idea should apply equally to the sexes . " Women , as well as men , are entitled to the full enjoyment of its practical blessings " . A group of 44 married women of western New York wrote to the Assembly in March 1848 , saying " your Declaration of Independence declares , that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed . And as women have never consented to , been represented in , or recognized by this government , it is evident that in justice no allegiance can be claimed from them ... Our numerous and yearly petitions for this most desirable object having been disregarded , we now ask your august body , to abolish all laws which hold married women more accountable for their acts than infants , idiots , and lunatics . " 
 The General Assembly in Pennsylvania passed a similar married woman 's property law a few weeks later , one which Lucretia Mott and others had championed . These progressive state laws were seen by American women as a sign of new hope for women 's rights . 
 On June 2 , 1848 in Rochester , New York , Gerrit Smith was nominated as the Liberty Party 's presidential candidate . Smith was Elizabeth Cady Stanton 's first cousin , and the two enjoyed debating and discussing political and social issues with each other whenever he came to visit . At the National Liberty Convention , held June 14 – 15 in Buffalo , New York , Smith gave a major address , including in his speech a demand for " universal suffrage in its broadest sense , females as well as males being entitled to vote . " The delegates approved a passage in their party platform addressing votes for women : " Neither here , nor in any other part of the world , is the right of suffrage allowed to extend beyond one of the sexes . This universal exclusion of woman ... argues , conclusively , that , not as yet , is there one nation so far emerged from barbarism , and so far practically Christian , as to permit woman to rise up to the one level of the human family . " At this convention , five votes were placed calling for Lucretia Mott to be Smith 's vice @-@ president — the first time in the United States that a woman was suggested for federal executive office . 
 = = = Quaker influence = = = 
 Many members of the Religious Society of Friends , known as Quakers , made their homes in western New York state , near Seneca Falls . A particularly progressive branch lived in and around Waterloo in Seneca County , New York . These Quakers strove for marital relationships in which men and women worked and lived in equality . 
 The M 'Clintocks came to Waterloo from a Quaker community in Philadelphia . They rented property from Richard P. Hunt , a wealthy Quaker and businessman . The M 'Clintock and Hunt families opposed slavery ; both participated in the free produce movement , and their houses served as stations on the Underground Railroad . 
 Traditional Quaker tenets held that men and women should meet separately when making religious decisions . By the 1840s , some <unk> Quakers determined to bring women and men together in the faith as an expression of their spiritual equality . In June 1848 , approximately 200 <unk> , including the Hunts and the M 'Clintocks , formed an even more radical Quaker group , known as the Yearly Meeting of Congregational Friends , or Progressive Friends . The Progressive Friends intended to further elevate the influence of women in affairs of the faith . They introduced joint meetings of men and women , giving women an equal voice .

 Lucretia and James Mott visited central and western New York in the summer of 1848 for a number of reasons , including visiting the Cattaraugus Reservation of the Seneca Nation and former slaves living in the province of Ontario , Canada . Mott was present at the meeting in which the Progressive Friends left the <unk> Quakers . They also visited Lucretia 's sister Martha Coffin Wright in Auburn , NY , where Mott also preached to prisoners at the Auburn State Penitentiary . Lucretia Mott 's skill and fame as an orator drew crowds wherever she went .

 After Quaker service on Sunday July 9 , 1848 , Lucretia Coffin Mott joined Mary Ann M 'Clintock , Martha Coffin Wright ( Mott 's witty sister , several months pregnant ) , Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Jane Hunt for tea at the Hunt home in Waterloo . The two eldest M 'Clintock daughters , Elizabeth and Mary Ann , Jr. may have accompanied their mother . Jane Hunt had given birth two weeks earlier , and was tending the baby at home . Over tea , Stanton , the only non @-@ Quaker present , vented a lifetime 's worth of pent @-@ up frustration , her " long @-@ accumulating discontent " about women 's subservient place in society . The five women decided to hold a women 's rights convention in the immediate future , while the Motts were still in the area , and drew up an announcement to run in the Seneca County Courier . The announcement began with these words : " <unk> 'S <unk> <unk> . — A Convention to discuss the social , civil , and religious condition and rights of woman " . The notice specified that only women were invited to the first day 's meetings on July 19 , but both women and men could attend on the second day to hear Lucretia Mott speak , among others . On July 11 , the announcement first appeared , giving readers just eight days ' notice until the first day of convention . Other papers such as Douglass 's North Star picked up the notice , printing it on July 14 . The meeting place was to be the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel in Seneca Falls . Built by a congregation of abolitionists and financed in part by Richard Hunt , the chapel had been the scene of many reform lectures , and was considered the only large building in the area that would open its doors to a women 's rights convention . 
 = = = Declaration , grievances , resolutions = = = 
 At their home in Waterloo on Sunday , July 16 , the M 'Clintocks hosted a smaller planning session for the convention . Mary Ann M 'Clintock and her eldest daughters , Elizabeth and Mary Ann , Jr . , discussed with Stanton the makeup of the resolutions that would be presented to the convention for approval . Each woman made certain her concerns were appropriately represented among the ten resolutions that they composed . Taken together , the resolutions demanded that women should have equality in the family , education , jobs , religion , and morals . One of the M 'Clintock women selected the Declaration of Independence from 1776 as a model for the declaration they wanted to make at their convention . The Declaration of Sentiments was then drafted in the parlor on a round , three @-@ legged , mahogany tea table . Stanton changed a few words of the Declaration of Independence to make it appropriate for a statement by women , replacing " The history of the present King of Great Britain " with " The history of mankind " as the basis for " usurpations on the part of man toward woman . " The women added the phrase " and women " to make " ... all men and women are created equal ... " A list of grievances was composed to form the second part of the Declaration . 
 Between July 16 and July 19 , at home on her own writing desk , Stanton edited the grievances and resolutions . Henry Brewster Stanton , a lawyer , politician and Stanton 's husband , helped substantiate the document by locating " extracts from laws bearing unjustly against woman 's property interests . " On her own , Stanton added a more radical point to the list of grievances and to the resolutions : the issue of women 's voting rights . To the grievances , she added " He has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise " , and to the Sentiments , she added a line about man depriving woman of " the elective franchise , thereby leaving her without representation in the halls of legislation ... " Stanton then copied the Declaration and resolutions into final draft form for presentation at the meeting . When he saw the addition of woman suffrage , Henry Stanton warned his wife " you will turn the proceedings into a farce . " He , like most men of his day , was not in favor of women gaining voting rights . Because he intended to run for elective office , he left Seneca Falls to avoid being connected with a convention promoting such an unpopular cause . Elizabeth Cady Stanton asked her sister Harriet Cady Eaton to accompany her ; Eaton brought her young son Daniel . 
 On July 16 , Lucretia Mott sent a note to Stanton apologizing in advance for James Mott not being able to attend the first day , as he was feeling " quite unwell " . Lucretia Mott wrote to say she would bring her sister , Martha Wright , and that the two women would participate in both days of the convention . 
 = = First day = = 
 On July 19 , 1848 , the morning of the first day of convention , the organizing committee arrived at the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel shortly before ten o 'clock on a hot , sunny day to find a crowd gathered outside and the church doors locked — an overlooked detail . Stanton 's young nephew Daniel was lifted through an open window so that he could <unk> the doors from the inside . Even though the first session had been announced as being exclusively for women , some young children of both sexes had been brought by their mothers , and about 40 men were there expecting to attend . The men were not turned away , but were asked to remain silent . Mary Ann M 'Clintock , Jr . , 26 years old , was appointed secretary , to take notes . 
 = = = Morning session = = = 
 Starting at 11 o 'clock , Elizabeth Cady Stanton spoke first , exhorting each woman in the audience to accept responsibility for her own life , and to " understand the height , the depth , the length , and the breadth of her own degradation . " Lucretia Mott then spoke , encouraging all to take up the cause . Stanton read the Declaration of Sentiments in its entirety , then re @-@ read each paragraph so that it could be discussed at length , and changes incorporated . The question of whether men 's signatures would be sought for the Declaration was discussed , with the vote looking favorable for including men , but the motion was tabled until the following day when men themselves could participate . The first session adjourned at 2 : 30 p.m.

 After a pause for refreshment in the 90 ° heat , an afternoon session began with Stanton and then Mott addressing the audience . The Declaration of Sentiments was read again and more changes were made to it . The resolutions , now numbering eleven with Stanton 's addition of women 's suffrage , were read aloud and discussed . Lucretia Mott read a humorous newspaper piece written by her sister Martha Wright in which Wright questioned why , after an overworked mother completed the myriad daily tasks that were required of her but not of her husband , she was the one upon whom written advice was " so lavishly bestowed . " Twenty @-@ seven @-@ year @-@ old Elizabeth W. M 'Clintock then delivered a speech , and the first day 's business was called to a close .

 In the evening , the meeting was opened to all persons , and Lucretia Mott addressed a large audience .

The editor of the National Reformer , a paper in Auburn , New York , reported that Mott 's extemporaneous evening speech was " one of the most eloquent , logical , and philosophical discourses which we ever listened to . "

 A larger crowd attended on the second day , including more men . Amelia Bloomer arrived late and took a seat in the upstairs gallery , there being none left in the main seating area .

 After Mott opened the meeting , the minutes of the previous day were read , and Stanton presented the Declaration of Sentiments . In regard to the grievance " He has taken from her all right in property , even to the wages she earns , " Assemblyman Ansel Bascom stood to say that he had recently been at the New York State Assembly which passed the Married Woman 's Property Act . Bascom spoke at length about the property rights it secured for married women , including property acquired after marriage . Further discussion of the Declaration ensued , including comments by Frederick Douglass , Thomas and Mary Ann M 'Clintock , and Amy Post ; the document was adopted unanimously . The question of men 's signatures was solved by having two sections of signatures , one for women followed by one for men . One hundred of the 300 present signed the Declaration of Sentiments , including 68 women and 32 men . Amelia Bloomer was one of the participants who did not endorse the Declaration ; she was focused at that time on the temperance movement . Ansel Bascom was the most conspicuous attendee who chose not to sign the Declaration . The National Reformer reported that those in the audience who evidently regarded the Declaration as " too bold and ultra " , including the lawyers known to be opposed to the equal rights of women , " failed to call out any opposition , except in a neighboring BAR @-@ ROOM . " 
 = = = Afternoon session , day two = = = 
 At the afternoon session , the eleven resolutions were read again , and each one was voted on individually . The only one that was materially questioned was the ninth , the one Stanton had added regarding women 's right to vote . It read : 
 Resolved , that it is the duty of the women of this country to secure to themselves their sacred right to the elective franchise . 
 Those who opposed this resolution argued that its presence would cause the other , more rational resolutions to lose support . Others argued that only the social , civil and religious rights of women should be addressed , not the political rights . James and Lucretia Mott were against the resolution ; Lucretia said to Stanton , " Why Lizzie , thee will make us ridiculous . " Stanton defended the concept of woman suffrage , saying women would then be able to affect future legislation and gain further rights . Frederick Douglass , the only African American at the meeting , stood and spoke eloquently in favor ; he said that he could not accept the right to vote himself as a black man if woman could not also claim that right . Douglass projected that the world would be a better place if women were involved in the political sphere . " In this denial of the right to participate in government , not merely the degradation of woman and the perpetuation of a great injustice happens , but the maiming and repudiation of one @-@ half of the moral and intellectual power of the government of the world . " Douglass 's powerful words rang true with many in attendance , and the resolution passed by a large majority . Lucretia Mott spoke to end the session . 
 = = = Evening session , day two = = = 
 Quaker Thomas M 'Clintock served as chair for the evening session , opening it at half @-@ past seven . The minutes were read , then Stanton spoke in defense of the many severe accusations brought against the much @-@ abused " Lords of Creation . " Following Stanton , Thomas M 'Clintock read several passages from Sir William Blackstone 's laws , to expose for the audience the basis of woman 's current legal condition of servitude to man . Lucretia Mott stood to offer another resolution : " Resolved , That the speedy success of our cause depends upon the zealous and untiring efforts of both men and women , for the overthrow of the monopoly of the pulpit , and for the securing to woman an equal participation with men in the various trades , professions and commerce . " This , the twelfth resolution , passed . 
 Mary Ann M 'Clintock , Jr. spoke briefly , calling upon woman to arouse from her lethargy and be true to herself and her God . Douglass again rose to speak in support of the cause of woman . Lucretia Mott spoke for an hour with one of her " most beautiful and spiritual appeals " . Although Lucretia Mott 's reputation as a speaker drew the audience , Mott recognized Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Mary Ann M 'Clintock as the " chief planners and architects " of the convention . To close the meeting , a committee was appointed to edit and publish the convention proceedings , with Amy Post , Eunice Newton Foote , Mary Ann M 'Clintock , Jr . , Elizabeth W. M 'Clintock and Stanton serving .

 = = = News reports = = = 
 Local newspapers printed reports of the convention , some positive , others not . The National Reformer reported that the convention " forms an era in the progress of the age ; it being the first convention of the kind ever held , and one whose influence shall not cease until woman is guaranteed all the rights now enjoyed by the other half of creation — Social , Civil and <unk> . " The Oneida Whig did not approve of the convention , writing of the Declaration : " This bolt is the most shocking and unnatural incident ever recorded in the history of <unk> . If our ladies will insist on voting and legislating , where , gentleman , will be our dinners and our elbows ? Where our domestic <unk> and the holes in our stockings ? " 
 Soon , newspapers across the country picked up the story . Reactions varied widely . In Massachusetts , the Lowell Courier published its opinion that , with women 's equality , " the lords must wash the dishes , scour up , be put to the tub , handle the broom , darn stockings . " In St. Louis , Missouri , the Daily Reveille trumpeted that " the flag of independence has been hoisted for the second time on this side of the Atlantic . " Horace Greeley in the New York Tribune wrote " When a sincere republican is asked to say in sober earnest what adequate reason he can give , for refusing the demand of women to an equal participation with men in political rights , he must answer , None at all . However unwise and mistaken the demand , it is but the assertion of a natural right , and such must be conceded . "

 Some of the ministers heading congregations in the area attended the Seneca Falls Convention , but none spoke out during the sessions , not even when comments from the floor were invited . On Sunday , July 23 , many who had attended , and more who had not , attacked the Convention , the Declaration of Sentiments , and the resolutions . Women in the congregations reported to Stanton , who saw the actions of the ministers as cowardly ; in their congregations , no one would be allowed to reply . 
 = = = Further conventions = = = 
 Signers of the Declaration of Sentiments hoped for " a series of Conventions , embracing every part of the country " to follow their own meeting . Because of the fame and drawing power of Lucretia Mott , who would not be staying in the Upstate New York area for much longer , a regional Woman 's Rights Convention was held two weeks later in Rochester , New York with Abigail Bush serving as president , and Lucretia Mott as featured speaker . In the next two years , " the infancy ... of the movement " , local and state women 's rights conventions were called in Ohio , Indiana , and Pennsylvania .

 A stamp was issued in 1948 in remembrance of the Seneca Falls Convention , featuring Elizabeth Cady Stanton , Carrie Chapman Catt , and Lucretia Mott as part of a Centennial Celebration in Seneca Falls . 
 The Women 's Rights National Historical Park was established in 1980 , and covers a total of 6 @.@ 83 acres ( 27 @,@ 600 m ² ) of land in Seneca Falls and nearby Waterloo , New York , USA . The park consists of four major historical properties , including the Wesleyan Methodist Church , which was the site of the Seneca Falls Convention , Elizabeth Cady Stanton 's home , and the M 'Clintock House , which was where the Declaration of Sentiments , resolutions , and speeches were drawn up for the Seneca Falls Convention . The Wesleyan Methodist Church and the M 'Clintock House were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 . 
 In 1998 First Lady Hillary Clinton gave a speech on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention . 
 = = Historiography = = 
 In 1870 , Paulina Wright Davis authored a history of the antebellum women 's rights movement , The History of the National Woman 's Rights Movement , and received approval of her account from many of the involved suffragists including Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton . Davis ' version gave the Seneca Falls meeting in 1848 a minor role , equivalent to other local meetings that had been held by women 's groups in the late 1840s . Davis set the beginning of the national and international women 's rights movement at Worcester , Massachusetts in 1850 , at the National Women 's Rights Convention when women from many states were invited , the influence of which was felt across the continent and in Great Britain . Stanton seemed to agree ; in an address to the National Woman Suffrage Association ( NWSA ) convention in 1870 , on the subject of the women 's rights movement , she said " The movement in England , as in America , may be dated from the first National Convention , held at Worcester , Mass . , October , 1850 . " 
 In 1876 , in the spirit of the nation 's centennial celebrations , Stanton and Susan B. Anthony decided to write a more expansive history of the women 's rights movement . They invited Lucy Stone to help , but Stone declined to be part of the project ; she was of the opinion that Stanton and Anthony would not fairly portray the divisive split between NWSA and American Woman Suffrage Association ( AWSA ) . Stanton and Anthony wrote without her and , in 1881 , they published the first volume of the History of Woman Suffrage , and placed themselves at each of its most important events , marginalizing Stone 's contribution . 
 According to Lisa <unk> , a professor of women 's history , the Seneca Falls Convention was central to their rendition of the movement 's history . Neither Stanton nor Anthony had been at the 1850 convention , which was associated with their rivals . Stanton , however , had played a key role at the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 , at which Stone had not been present . In the early 1870s , Stanton and Anthony began to present Seneca Falls as the beginning of the women 's rights movement , an origin story that downplayed Stone 's role . Pointing out that the women 's rights movement could be said to have begun even earlier than Seneca Falls , <unk> said the History of Woman Suffrage dealt with these earlier events relatively briefly in its first three chapters , the first of which is titled " Preceding Causes . " In the volume , Stanton did not mention the Liberty Party 's plank on woman suffrage pre @-@ dating the Seneca Falls Convention by a month , and she did not describe the Worcester National Women 's Rights Convention , organized by Stone and Davis in 1850 , as the beginning of the women 's rights movement . Rather , Stanton named the 1840 Anti @-@ Slavery Convention in London as the birth of the " movement for woman 's suffrage , in both England and America " . She positioned the Seneca Falls meeting as her own political debut , and characterized it as the beginning of the women 's rights movement , calling it " the greatest movement for human liberty recorded on the pages of history — a demand for freedom to one @-@ half the entire race . " Stanton worked to enshrine the Declaration of Sentiments as a foundational treatise in a number of ways , not the least of which was by imbuing the small , three @-@ legged tea table upon which the first draft of it was composed an importance similar to that of Thomas Jefferson 's desk upon which he wrote the Declaration of Independence . The M 'Clintocks gave Stanton the table , then Stanton gave it to Susan B. Anthony on the occasion of her 80th birthday , though Anthony had no part in the Seneca Falls meeting . In keeping with Stanton 's promotion of the table as an iconic relic , women 's rights activists put it in a place of honor at the head of the casket at the funeral of Susan B. Anthony on March 14 , 1906 . Subsequently , it was displayed prominently on the stage at each of the most important suffrage meetings until 1920 , even though the grievance and resolution about woman suffrage was not written on it . The table is kept at the Smithsonian Institution 's National Museum of American History in Washington , D.C. 
 Lucretia Mott reflected in August 1848 upon the two women 's rights conventions in which she had participated that summer , and assessed them no greater than other projects and missions she was involved with . She wrote that the two gatherings were " greatly encouraging ; and give hope that this long neglected subject will soon begin to receive the attention that its importance demands . " 
 Historian Gerda Lerner has pointed out that religious ideas provided a fundamental source for the Declaration of Sentiments . Most of the women attending the convention were active in Quaker or evangelical Methodist movements . The document itself drew from writings by the evangelical Quaker Sarah Grimké to make biblical claims that God had created woman equal to man and that man had usurped God 's authority by establishing " absolute tyranny " over woman . According to author Jami <unk> , Grimké 's writings opened the public 's eyes to ideas like women 's rights , and for the first time they were willing to question conventional notions about the subordination of women . 
 = Caernarfon town walls = 
 Caernarfon 's town walls are a medieval defensive structure around the town of Caernarfon in North Wales . The walls were constructed between 1283 and 1292 after the foundation of Caernarfon by Edward I , alongside the adjacent castle . The walls are 734 m ( 2 @,@ 408 ft ) long and include eight towers and two medieval gatehouses . The project was completed using large numbers of labourers brought in from England ; the cost of building the walls came to around £ 3 @,@ 500 , a large sum for the period . The walls were significantly damaged during the rebellion of Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294 , and had to be repaired at considerable expense . Political changes in the 16th century reduced the need to maintain such defences around the town . Today the walls form part of the UNESCO world heritage site administered by Cadw . Historians Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham describe the defences as " a remarkably intact walled circuit " . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 13th century = = = 
 Before the English construction of the town of Caernarfon , the area had been occupied first by the Romans , who built the fort of Segontium , and later by both the Normans and the Welsh princes . As a result of this long history , depicted in the Welsh saga of Mabinogion , the site was both culturally and politically significant to the medieval Welsh . The English kings and Welsh princes had vied for control of North Wales since the 1070s and the conflict had been renewed during the 13th century , leading to Edward I intervening in North Wales for the second time during his reign in 1282 . Edward invaded with a huge army , pushing north from Carmarthen and westwards from Montgomery and Chester . By summer 1283 Edward had secured Caernarfon and the surrounding area . 
 The king decided that the location would become the centre of a new county and the capital of the principality of North Wales , with a new castle and walled town forming the administrative centre . Edward 's plan was a colonial enterprise and placing the new town and walls on the Caernarfon site was in part a symbolic act to demonstrate English power ; the walls also symbolised the town 's status as the capital of North Wales . 
 Traditionally Caernarfon 's design and defences have been thought to have been inspired by the growth of the bastides . The bastides were new planned towns created in both France and English @-@ held Gascony during the period , characterised by grids of straight streets , often defended by combinations of castles and town walls . More recent research , however , has shown that English town design played a more significant role in shaping Caernarfon and other Edwardian town plans . In the case of Caernarfon , the town plan and walls were adapted to fit around the site of the former Norman castle on the site , which lay just outside the new town and was used a market place . 
 The walls of Caernarfon were built at the same time as the castle , under the overall supervision of Master James of Saint George , Edward 's chief architect in North Wales . Between 1283 to 1284 , Richard the Engineer acted as James ' deputy on the site ; later , between 1295 and 1308 , Walter of Hereford performed a similar role , and may have also been responsible for earlier work on the walls as well . Huge amounts of labourers were mobilised from across England for the task , massed at Chester and then brought into Wales for each summer building season . Work on the walls progressed quickly , albeit in uneven bursts : local houses were demolished to make way for the fortifications and the stone walls and gates were probably finished by 1292 . The cost of building the town walls was around £ 3 @,@ 500 , a large sum for the period . 
 Otto de Grandson , a favourite of Edward I , was appointed as constable of Caernarfon and justiciar of North Wales , with responsibility for security in the region . In 1294 , however , Madog ap Llywelyn revolted against English rule and undertook a wide campaign across North Wales , attacking the town of Caernarfon . Despite the walls , the town was overrun , the walls badly damaged , and the castle — still largely unfinished — was easily taken and set on fire . Edward responded with military force the next year : he retook Caernarfon and ordered the town walls to be fully repaired by November 1295 , at a cost of around £ 1 @,@ 195 . 
 = = = 14th to 18th centuries = = = 
 The new town of Caernarfon was populated by English settlers , particularly from nearby Cheshire and Lancashire , and the town walls were in part designed to encourage immigrants and royal officials to settle there in safety . The town of Caernarfon did not prove a successful settlement , however ; by 1298 it had only 59 burgage tenements — properties paying rent to the king — making it far less prosperous than either neighbouring Conwy or Beaumaris , and the situation did not improve during the 14th century . In 1400 Welsh prince Owain Glyndŵr rose in rebellion against English rule , but despite attempts to take Caernarfon in 1403 and 1404 , the town 's defences held out . The ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne resulted in a change in the way Wales was administered . The Tudors were Welsh in origin , and their rule lessened hostilities between the Welsh and English , reducing the need to maintain Caernarfon 's castle and walls and easing the restrictions on Welsh access to the town — the Welsh were finally allowed to live inside Caernarfon in 1507 . 
 Around 1800 , Caernarfon 's local corporation undertook a programme of modernisation work , inserting several new gateways in the town walls ; other changes were also made to the walls during the period , with some towers being converted for use as administrative buildings and the gatehouses altered to accommodate more modern offices . During the 19th century the town of Caernarfon grew considerably , prompted by the slate trade and the construction of the Chester to Holyhead railway line . As a result of this population pressure , by the 20th century housing had encroached along the inside and outside of the town walls , so that in many places the walls had vanished from view . During the 20th century the walls were gradually acquired by the state and these houses demolished . 
 Today Caernarfon 's walls are managed by the Welsh heritage organisation Cadw as a tourist attraction , although only a small part of the wall @-@ walk is open to the public . The walls require ongoing maintenance ; in the financial year between 2002 and 2003 , for example , maintaining the historic fabric of the walls and the castle cost £ 4 @,@ 500 ( £ 5 @,@ 710 in 2010 terms ) . The walls were declared part of a UNESCO world heritage site in 1986 and are classed as a grade 1 listed building and hold scheduled monument status . They are considered by historians Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham to be " a remarkably intact walled circuit " . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The Caernarfon town walls today present an unbroken , 734 m ( 2 @,@ 408 ft ) long circuit around the town , enclosing 4 @.@ 18 hectares ( 10 @.@ 3 acres ) , and are unusually well preserved . They are mostly built from the same carboniferous limestone used at the castle . The eight towers along the wall are mostly " gap @-@ backed " , lacking walls on the inside of the towers , and originally included removable wooden bridges to allow sections of the walls to be sealed off from attackers . 
 The two original entrances to the town were through the West and East Gates . The West Gate faced onto the harbour , and was also known as the Golden Gate ( Welsh : Porth @-@ yr @-@ Aur ) ; in the medieval period , this name would have evoked images of imperial Roman and Arthurian power , as it was the name of the primary gateway in the city of Constantinople . It was originally defended by a portcullis , but was modified with additional Gothic features in the 19th century . The East Gate formed the landward entrance to the town , originally overlooking the river <unk> — the river is now culverted over . The gatehouse contained offices for most of the period since its construction in the 13th century , first housing the royal exchequer , then Caernarfon 's town hall and finally the guildhall . The offices were finally removed in the 1960s . Little of the original gatehouse remains , due to 18th and 19th century building work , although the base of the towers remains medieval . Newer entrances to the town , made by creating additional gateways in the walls , include Northgate , Greengate and the entrance to Market Street . 
 In the north @-@ west corner of the walls is the 14th @-@ century chapel of Saint Mary , built into the defences and using the only fully circular tower in the walls as a vestry . Further along the west side of the walls , several of the towers have been converted for various uses . One forms part of the County Offices , having been incorporated into the former County Gaol in the 19th century ; another has been used by the Royal Welsh Yacht Club since the 19th century , and a third has been converted into a holiday home by the Landmark Trust . 
 = Waddesdon Bequest = 
 In 1898 Baron Ferdinand Rothschild bequeathed to the British Museum as the Waddesdon Bequest the contents from his New Smoking Room at Waddesdon Manor . This consisted of a wide @-@ ranging collection of almost 300 objets d 'art et de <unk> which included exquisite examples of jewellery , plate , enamel , carvings , glass and maiolica . Earlier than most objects is the outstanding Holy Thorn Reliquary , probably created in the 1390s in Paris for John , Duke of Berry . The collection is in the tradition of a <unk> or treasure house such as those formed by the Renaissance princes of Europe ; indeed , the majority of the objects are from late Renaissance Europe , although there are several important medieval pieces , and outliers from classical antiquity and medieval Syria . 
 Following the sequence of the museum 's catalogue numbers , and giving the first number for each category , the bequest consists of : " bronzes " , handles and a knocker ( <unk> ) ; arms , armour and ironwork ( <unk> ) ; enamels ( <unk> ) ; glass ( <unk> ) ; Italian maiolica ( <unk> ) ; " cups etc in gold and hard stone " ( <unk> ) ; silver plate ( <unk> ) ; jewellery ( <unk> ) ; cutlery ( <unk> ) ; " caskets , etc " ( <unk> ) ; carvings in wood and stone ( <unk> – 265 ) . There is no group for paintings , and <unk> , a portrait miniature on vellum in a wooden frame , is included with the jewellery , though this is because the subject is wearing a pendant in the collection . 
 The collection was assembled for a particular place , and to reflect a particular aesthetic ; other parts of Ferdinand Rothschild 's collection contain objects in very different styles , and the Bequest should not be taken to reflect the totality of his taste . Here what most appealed to Ferdinand Rothschild were intricate , superbly executed , highly decorated and rather ostentatious works of the Late Gothic , Renaissance and Mannerist periods . Few of the objects could be said to rely on either simplicity or Baroque sculptural movement for their effect , though several come from periods and places where much Baroque work was being made . A new display for the collection , which under the terms of the bequest must be kept and displayed together , opened on 11 June 2015 . 
 = = History = = 
 The collection was started by Baron Ferdinand 's father , Baron Anselm von Rothschild ( 1803 – 1874 ) , and may include some objects from earlier Rothschild collections . For Mayer Amschel Rothschild ( 1744 – 1812 ) of Frankfurt , who began the prominence of the family , his business dealing in coins , " antiques , medals , and objects of display " preceded and financed his banking operations , and most Rothschilds continued to collect art . 
 At least one of the objects now in the British Museum can be seen in a cabinet in the background of a family portrait from 1838 ( left ) , the year before Ferdinand was born . In his Reminiscences Ferdinand recalled his excitement as a child when he was allowed to help wrap and unwrap his father 's collection , which spent the summers in a strongroom when the family left Vienna for a country villa . 
 The period after the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars offered tremendous opportunities for collectors of the decorative arts of the medieval and Renaissance periods . These categories were very little valued by the art market in general , and metalwork was routinely sold for its bullion value alone . Some of the older objects in precious metal in the collection may have first been received by the family as part of banking transactions ; ownership of such pieces had always been partly a way to get some use from capital . Ferdinand records several complaints that his father did not make more use of his opportunities , but in his last years Anselm began to expand his collecting range , and it was he who bought both the Holy Thorn Reliquary and the Ghisi Shield . This golden age for collectors had passed by the time Ferdinand inherited his part of his father 's collection in 1874 , which was also the year he bought the Waddesdon estate and began to build there . Ferdinand continued to expand the collection until his death in 1898 , mostly using dealers , and expanding the range of objects collected . In particular Ferdinand expanded to around fifty the ten or so pieces of jewellery in his father 's collection . 
 The New Smoking Room built to hold the collection was only planned from 1891 , and the collection was moved in there in early 1896 , less than three years before Ferdinand 's death . Good photographs allow an appreciation of how the objects were displayed , in glassed cases and on open shelves around the walls , over doors , and over the small fireplace , which had an elaborate shelved chimneypiece in wood above . Several objects , including the Casket of Saint Valerie , were on tables away from the walls . Comfortable seating was plentiful , some upholstered with pieces from medieval vestments , and there were framed photographs and houseplants . The room is now refilled with objects from the same period though of somewhat different types , and visitors to Waddesdon Manor can see it from the doorway . 
 The room , with the adjoining Billiards Room , is the only reception room at Waddesdon Manor to follow the French Renaissance style of the exterior ; the other rooms are in broadly 18th @-@ century styles , and contain a magnificent collection of paintings and furniture centred on that century . The segregation of the collection was part of the concept of what has been called the " neo @-@ <unk> " , adopted by some other very wealthy collectors of the period . The Renaissance Room at what is now the Wallace Collection and the collection of Sir Julius Wernher were other examples formed in England over the same period . The neo @-@ <unk> aimed to emulate the collections formed during the Renaissance itself , mostly by princely houses ; of these the outstanding survivals were the Habsburg collections in Vienna , Prague and <unk> , as well as the treasuries of the Grünes <unk> in Dresden , the Munich <unk> and Kassel . Unlike those collections , contemporary and recent objects were not included . 
 Baron Ferdinand was a restless and , by his own account , unhappy man , whose life was blighted by the death of his wife after giving birth to their only child , who was stillborn ; this was in 1866 . Thereafter he lived with his unmarried sister Alice . As well as filling positions in local public life , he was Liberal MP for Aylesbury from 1885 until his death , and from 1896 a Trustee of the British Museum , probably at the instigation of Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks . 
 Ferdinand recognized and welcomed the drift of high quality art into public collections , which had begun in earnest during his time as a collector . While most of his assets and collections were left to his sister Alice , the collection now forming the Bequest and , separately , a group of 15 manuscripts now in the British Library , were left to the British Museum . He had already donated some significant objects to the museum in his lifetime , which not are not counted in the Bequest . 
 Baron Ferdinand 's bequest was most specific , and failure to observe the terms would make it void . It stated that the collection should be 
 placed in a special room to be called the Waddesdon Bequest Room separate and apart from the other contents of the Museum and thenceforth for ever thereafter , keep the same in such room or in some other room to be substituted for it . 
 These terms are still observed , and until late 2014 the collection was shown in the rather small room 45 , in a display opened in 1973 . In 2015 the Bequest was moved to Room 2A , a new , larger gallery on the ground floor , close to the main entrance on Museum Street . Until the Chinese ceramics collection of the Percival David Foundation moved to the British Museum the Waddesdon Bequest was the only collection segregated in this way . 
 = = Renaissance metalwork = = 
 Much of the collection consists of luxury objects from the 16th century . Large pieces of metalwork in silver or silver @-@ gilt make an immediate impression in the display , and these were designed to dazzle and impress guests when used at table , or displayed in rows on a sideboard with shelves like a modern bookcase or Welsh dresser . Many are very heavily decorated in virtuoso displays of goldsmiths ' technique ; rather too heavily for conventional modern taste . They are certainly ostentatious objects designed to display the wealth of their owner , and in many cases were designed to be appreciated when held in the hand , rather than seen under glass . 
 There are a number of standing cups with a cover , many from Augsburg and Nuremberg ; these were used to drink a toast from to welcome a guest , and were also a common gift presented in politics and diplomacy , and by cities to distinguished visitors . Their decoration sometimes reflected the latest taste , often drawing from designs made as prints and circulated around Europe , but there was also often a very conservative continuation of late Gothic styles , which persisted until they came to be part of a <unk> ( " Neo @-@ Gothic " ) revival in the early 17th century . The largest object in the bequest with a specifically Jewish connection is a silver @-@ gilt standing cup made in Nuremberg about 1600 , but by 1740 belonging to a Jewish burial society in Bratislava , as a Hebrew language inscription records . 
 Apart from pieces purely in metal , a number are centred on either hardstone carvings or organic objects such as horns , seashells , ostrich eggshells , and exotic plant seeds . These " curiosities " are typical of the taste of the Renaissance " age of discovery " and show the <unk> and the cabinet of curiosities overlapping . A different form of novelty is represented by a table @-@ ornament of a silver @-@ gilt foot @-@ high figure of a huntsman with a dog and brandishing a spear . There is a clockwork mechanism in his base which propels him along the table , and his head lifts off to show a cup , and he would have been used in drinking games . There are separate figures of a boar and stags for him to pursue , though not making a set ; these can also function as cups . 
 One of the most important objects in the collection is a parade shield , never intended for use in battle , designed and made by Giorgio Ghisi , who was both a goldsmith and an important printmaker . It is signed and dated 1554 . With a sword hilt , dated 1570 and now in Budapest , this is the only surviving damascened metalwork by Ghisi . The shield is made of iron hammered in relief , then damascened with gold and partly plated with silver . It has an intricate design with a scene of battling horseman in the centre , within a frame , around which are four further frames containing allegorical female figures , the frames themselves incorporating minute and crowded subjects on a much smaller scale from the Iliad and ancient mythology , inlaid in gold . 
 Other major pieces are sets of a ewer and basin , basin in this context meaning a large dish or salver , which when used were carried round by pairs of servants for guests to wash their hands without leaving the table . However the examples in the collection were probably hardly ever used for this , but were intended purely for display on sideboards ; typically the basins are rather shallow for actual use . These were perhaps the grandest type of plate , with large surfaces where Mannerist inventiveness could run riot in the decoration . They were already expensive because of the weight of the precious metal , to which a huge amount of time by highly skilled silversmiths was added . The <unk> @-@ Lynden set in the bequest is documented in that family back to 1610 , some 65 years after it was made in Antwerp , and weighs a little less than five kilos . 
 = = Renaissance enamels = = 
 Though the Waddesdon Bequest contains two very important medieval objects with enamel , and much of the jewellery and decorated cutlery uses enamel heavily , the great majority of the items that can be called " enamels " are in the French 16th @-@ century style that was led by painted Limoges enamel , rather than the champlevé enamel for which Limoges was famous in the Romanesque period . The new technique produced pieces painted with highly detailed figurative scenes or decorative schemes . As with Italian maiolica , the imagery tended to be drawn from classical mythology or allegory , though the bequest includes some Old Testament scenes , and compositions were very often drawn from German , French or Italian prints . <unk> were produced in workshops which often persisted in the same family for several generations , and are often signed in the enamel , or identifiable , at least as far as the family or workshop , by punch marks on the back of panels , as well as by style . Leading artists represented in the collection include Suzanne de Court , Pierre Reymond , Jean de Court , Pierre Courtois and Léonard Limousin . 
 <unk> were made as objects such as candlesticks , dishes , vessels and mirrors , and also as flat plaques to be included in other objects such as caskets . The collection includes all these types , with both unmounted plaques and caskets fitted with plaques . The jolly grotesques illustrated at right are on the reverse of a large dish whose main face shows a brightly @-@ coloured depiction of the Destruction of Pharaoh 's army in the Red Sea . Both designs are closely paralleled , without being exactly copied , in pieces in other collections , notably one in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York . The designs are also based on prints , but adapted by the <unk> for their pieces . 
 The Casket of the <unk> is an elaborate small locking casket with a framework of silver @-@ gilt and gems , set with grisaille panels with touches of gold and flesh @-@ tints . It represents the sophisticated court taste of about 1535 , and was probably intended for a lady 's jewels . Most such sets of enamel inserts have lost the settings they were intended for . 
 = = Jewellery = = 
 The emphasis of the jewellery is very firmly on spectacular badges and pendant jewels of the late Renaissance in what is known as the " Spanish Style " that was adopted throughout Europe between about 1550 and 1630 , using gems together with gold and enamel to create dazzling tiny sculptures . These were originally worn by both men and women , but as a collection the Waddesdon group was chosen for display ( and in a specifically male setting ) rather than for wearing , except at the occasional fancy @-@ dress ball , a fashion at the time . The group demonstrate little interest in gemstones and pearls for their own sake . Although such pieces have survived more often than styles emphasizing gem stones and massy gold , which were typically recycled for their materials when fashion changed , the demand from 19th @-@ century collectors greatly exceeded the supply of authentic survivals , and many pieces include much work from that period ( see below ) . 
 For many of the pieces though it is not easy to place the date or country of manufacture . There is no such difficulty with the most famous jewel in the collection , the Lyte Jewel , which was made in London and presented to Thomas Lyte of Lytes Cary , Somerset in 1610 by King James I of England , who loved large jewels , and giving them to others . Lyte was not a regular at court , but he had drawn up a family tree tracing James 's descent back to the legendary Trojan , Brut . The jewel contains a miniature portrait of the king by Nicolas Hilliard , though for conservation reasons this is now removed from the jewel . Lyte wears the jewel in a portrait of 1611 , showing a drop below the main oval set with three diamonds , which had gone before 1882 . The front cover has an elaborate openwork design with James 's monogram IR , while the back has very finely executed enamel decoration . 
 One pendant , shaped like a lantern with a tiny Crucifixion inside , was made in 16th @-@ century Mexico , and from comparison with other pieces may originally have included Mexican feather work , a Pre @-@ Columbian art whose craftspeople the Spanish missionaries employed in workshops for export luxury objects . 
 = = Objects from before the Renaissance = = 
 The collection includes an eclectic group of objects of very high quality that predate the Renaissance . The oldest objects are a set of four Hellenistic bronze medallions with heads projecting in very high relief , and round handles hanging below . These date to the century before Christ , and came from a tomb in modern Turkey , and were fixtures for some wooden object , perhaps a chest . The heads are identified as Ariadne , Dionysos , Persephone and Pluto . The carved agate body of <unk> may be late Roman , and is discussed below . 
 The Palmer Cup is an important early Islamic glass cup , made around 1200 , in Syria or perhaps Egypt , and painted in enamels . In the same century it was given a silver @-@ gilt and rock crystal stem and foot in France . Below a poetic Arabic inscription praising wine @-@ drinking , a seated prince holding a cup or glass is flanked by five standing attendants , two playing castanets and the others holding weapons . As an early enamel @-@ painted image the cup is extremely rare in Islamic glass , although similar images in Islamic pottery of the period are found . There are a handful of comparable early Islamic glass cups with enamel that have survived in old European collections , such as the Luck of <unk> in the Victoria and Albert Museum , and others in the Grünes <unk> in Dresden and the Louvre , and others are recorded in old inventories . Often these were given a new foot in metalwork in Europe , as here . There is also a large mosque lamp with enamelled decoration from the late 14th century . 
 Romanesque art is represented by an unusually large Limoges enamel reliquary in the common chasse shape , like a gabled house . This was made in about 1170 to hold relics of Saint Valerie of Limoges , a virgin @-@ martyr of the Roman period who was the most important local saint of Limoges , a key centre for Romanesque champlevé enamel . Her highly visual story is told in several scenes that use a wide range of colours , with the rest of the front face decorated in the " <unk> " style , with the space between the figure filled with scrolling motifs on a gold background . St Valerie was a <unk> saint , who after she was beheaded carried her own head to give to her bishop , Saint Martial , who had converted her . 
 There are many more objects in a Gothic style , and as is typical for northern Europe several of these come from well into the 16th century , and should be considered as belonging to the Northern Renaissance . However the most important medieval object , and arguably the most important single piece in the collection , though from the late Gothic period , has nothing strictly Gothic in its style , and represents a very advanced court taste in this respect . This is the Holy Thorn Reliquary , which was probably created in the 1390s in Paris for the Valois prince John , Duke of Berry , to house a relic of the Crown of Thorns . It is one of a small number of major goldsmiths ' works or joyaux that survive from the extravagant world of the courts of the Valois royal family around 1400 . It is made of gold , lavishly decorated with jewels and pearls , and uses the technique of enamelling en ronde bosse , or " in the round " , which had been recently developed when the reliquary was made , to create a total of 28 three @-@ dimensional figures , mostly in white enamel . 
 In contrast , two highly elaborate metalwork covers for the treasure bindings of the Epistle and Gospel books for the high altar of a large church , probably Ulm Minster , were made around 1506 but are full of spiky Gothic architectural details , although the many figures in high relief are on the verge of Renaissance style . 
 There are two German statues of saints in wood , about half life @-@ size , from the decades around 1500 , and a larger number of miniature boxwood carvings . These include " prayer nuts " of superb quality from around 1510 to 1530 . These are small wooden " balls " which open up to reveal carvings of religious scenes that fit dozens of tiny figures into a space two or three inches across , and were a fashion among royalty and the wealthy ; they were apparently made in the northern Netherlands . They seem to have often been suspended from belts , or formed part of a rosary ; others still have copper carrying cases . A trick of technique in making them is that the main carved scene is made on a smaller hemisphere , allowing access from behind , which was then set into the main hemisphere . 
 = = Rock crystal and hardstone pieces = = 
 There are seven glass vessels in the collection , but a larger number of pieces in transparent rock crystal or quartz , a mineral that might easily be taken for glass . This was always a much more valuable and prestigious material , qualifying as a semi @-@ precious stone . Needing very patient grinding and drilling , it is much harder to work than glass ( though correspondingly less easy to break once finished ) , and the pieces include mounts or bases in precious metal , which none of the actual glass has ; nor are the rock crystal pieces painted . Read 's catalogue groups these and other pieces in semi @-@ precious stone with the objects in gold , as opposed to the " silver plate " , which probably reflects how a Renaissance collector would have ranked them . There are ten pieces in crystal and nine in other stones . 
 Two crystal pieces are plain oval plaques engraved with figurative scenes , a different tradition going back to pieces such as the Carolingian Lothair Crystal , also in the British Museum . In 1902 Read 's catalogue suggested that " It is to this section that in all probability most eyes will be attracted , as well for the beauty of the specimens as for their rarity and consequent cost " ; if this was the case then , it is probably not so a century later . Some pieces are now regarded as 19th century , or largely so , and Reinhold <unk> , the Van Meegeren of Renaissance metalwork , is now held responsible in several cases . 
 A wide low crystal vase with cover is engraved with the name of the Mughal Emperor Akbar , and was long thought to have been German , but sent out to India as a diplomatic gift , as the metalwork mounts are clearly European in style . It is now seen as an original , and exceptionally rare , Mughal crystal carving , to which the mounts were added in the 19th century , perhaps in Paris . However the cartouche with Akbar 's name does not seem to specialists correct for a contemporary court piece , and the vase in India was probably carved after his reign ( 1556 – 1605 ) , and the name perhaps added even later . 
 = = Renaissance glass = = 
 Apart from the two pieces of Islamic glass described above , there are five Renaissance or Baroque glass vessels , all unusual and of exceptional quality . Most are Venetian glass ; one is moulded opaque Bohemian glass ( <unk> ) with a Triumph of Neptune , and is now dated to the late 17th century ; it is also dichroic glass , which changes colour depending on whether it is lit from the front or behind . There is a very rare goblet in opaque turquoise glass with enamels ( <unk> ) ; this was to imitate or suggest a vessel in even more expensive semi @-@ precious stone . The late 15th @-@ century <unk> Cup with its cover is one of a small group of vessels made in Murano , Venice in a German or Central European taste , drawing on metalwork shapes used there . It carries a later inscription in Czech urging that the health of the Lords of <unk> , near Brno , be drunk , and was probably the " welcome cup " of the castle there . 
 = = Italian maiolica = = 
 The six pieces of painted Italian maiolica , or painted and tin @-@ glazed earthenware , are all larger than the average , and there are none of the dishes that are the most common maiolica shape . The earliest piece is a large statue of Fortuna standing on a dolphin , holding a sail , by Giovanni della Robbia , made in Florence about 1500 – 10 . This is a rare representative of the Early to High Italian Renaissance in the bequest . 
 The other pieces are from later in the 16th century . The most important are a pair of large snake @-@ handled vases , nearly 2 foot ( 60 cm ) high , painted with mythological scenes , to which French ormolu bases and lids were added shortly before they were bought in Paris by Horace Walpole for the " Gallery " at Strawberry Hill House in 1765 – 66 . Ormolu mounts were often added by 18th @-@ century collectors to such pieces , but few have remained in place . 
 = = Other types of object = = 
 The collection includes a number of other objects , with a few guns , swords and military or hunting equipment . There is also a German brass " hunting calendar " with several thin leaves that unfold . These include recessed lines filled with wax , enabling the keen hunter on a large scale to record his bags of wolf , bear , deer , boar and rabbit , as well as the performance of his dogs . There is a small cabinet with 11 drawers ( plus other secret ones ) made as a classical facade , or perhaps a theatre stage with scenery ; the decoration is mostly damascened iron , and is 16th @-@ century Milanese work . 
 Apart from the older woodcarvings discussed above , the bequest includes a number of small mostly German Renaissance portraits as carvings in wood , either in relief or in the round . These are of very high quality and include two miniature busts by Conrad <unk> of Philibert II , Duke of Savoy , who died young before the bust was made , and his Habsburg wife , Margaret of Austria . There are also some medallion portraits in very soft stone , that allows fine detail , and one allegorical scene attributed to Peter <unk> . 
 = = <unk> and revised attributions = = 
 Any collection formed before the 20th century ( and many later ones ) is likely to contain pieces that can no longer sustain their original attributions . In general the Waddesdon Bequest can be said to have held up well in this regard , and the most significant brush with forgery has been to benefit the collection . In 1959 it was confirmed that the Waddesdon Holy Thorn Reliquary had been in the Habsburg Imperial <unk> ( " treasure chamber " ) in Vienna from 1677 onwards . It remained in Vienna until after 1860 , when it appeared in an exhibition . Some time after this it was sent to be restored by Salomon Weininger , an art dealer with access to skilled craftsmen , who secretly made a number of copies . He was later convicted of other forgeries , and died in prison in 1879 , but it was still not realised that he had returned one of his copies of the reliquary to the Imperial collections instead of the original , and later sold the original , which is now in the bequest . One of the copies remained in the Ecclesiastical Treasury of the Imperial Habsburg Court in Vienna , where the deception remained undetected for several decades . 
 In the 19th century a number of types of objects were especially subject to major reworking , combining some original parts with those newly @-@ made . This was especially a feature of arms and armour , jewellery , and objects combining hardstone carvings and metal mounts . This was mostly done by dealers , but sometimes collectors also . 
 Another object with a complicated and somewhat uncertain history is a two @-@ handled agate vase with Renaissance @-@ style metal mounts , which was acquired , with other similar pieces , for Waddesdon from the Duke of Devonshire 's collection in about 1897 , not long before Baron Ferdinand 's death . Sir Hugh Tait 's 1991 catalogue says of the vase : 
 " Origin : 
 ( i ) Carved agate : authenticity is uncertain ; since 1899 loosely described as " antique Roman " or " antique " , but recently attributed to the late Roman period , c . AD 400 . 
 ( ii ) <unk> gold mounts and cover : previously described as " Italian , 16th century " and , subsequently , attributed to Benvenuto Cellini ( 1500 – 71 ) but now attributed to the hand of an early 19th @-@ century copyist – before 1834 – perhaps working in London . " 
 As he describes , it was Tait who overturned the attribution to Cellini in 1971 . 
 In a collection of Renaissance metalwork Benvenuto Cellini ( 1500 – 71 ) represents the ultimate attribution , as his genuine works as a goldsmith are rarer than paintings by Giorgione . In his 1902 catalogue Charles Hercules Read mentions that many of the pendants had been attributed to Cellini , but refrains from endorsing the attributions . A small silver hand @-@ bell ( <unk> ) had belonged to Horace Walpole , who praised it extravagantly in a letter as " the <unk> thing in the world , a silver bell for an inkstand made by Benvenuto Cellini . It makes one believe all the extravagant encomiums he bestows on himself ; indeed so does his Perseus . Well , my bell is in the finest taste , and is swarmed by caterpillars , lizards , grasshoppers , flies , and masques , that you would take it for one of the plagues of Egypt . They are all in altissimo , nay in out @-@ <unk> <unk> and yet almost invisible but with a glass . Such foliage , such <unk> ! " . However Baron Ferdinand had realized that it was more likely to be by Wenzel <unk> , goldsmith to the Emperor Rudolf II , to whom it is still attributed . Another piece no longer attributed to Cellini is a large bronze door @-@ knocker , with a figure of Neptune , 40 cm high , and weighing over 11 kilos . 
 One category of the bequest that has seen several demotions is the 16 pieces and sets of highly decorated cutlery ( <unk> – 216 ) . Read dated none of these later than the 17th century , but on the British Museum database in 2014 several were dated to the 19th century , and were recent fraudulent creations when they entered the collection , some made by Reinhold <unk> . Doubts have also been raised over a glass cup and cover bearing the date 1518 ( <unk> ) , which might in fact be 19th @-@ century . Eight pieces of silver plate were redated to the 19th century by Hugh Tait , and some of the jewellery . 
 = = Displaying the Bequest = = 
 The Bequest was on display at the British Museum from 9 April 1900 , in Room 40 , which today contains the later medieval displays . An illustrated catalogue by Charles Hercules Read , who had replaced Franks as Keeper of British and Medieval Antiquities , was published in 1902 . Photographs in the catalogue show a typical museum display for the period , with wood and glass cases spaced around the walls and free @-@ standing in the centre , the latter with two levels . In 1921 it was moved to the North Wing . 
 In 1973 the new setting in Room 45 aimed " to create an element of surprise and wonder " in a small space , where only the objects were brightly lit , and displayed in an outer octagon of wall cases , and an inner one of partition walls , rising to the low ceiling and set with shallow display cases , some visible from both sides . In the centre the Holy Thorn Reliquary occupied its own pillar display . 
 The new ground floor room at the front of the museum , opened in June 2015 , returns the Bequest to a larger space and a more open setting . It is in the oldest part of the building and some later accretions to the room have been removed as part of the new installation . The design is by the architects Stanton Williams , and the project received funding from The Rothschild Foundation . 
 = Spec Ops : The Line = 
 Spec Ops : The Line is a 2012 third @-@ person shooter video game developed by the German studio Yager Development and published by 2K Games . It was released on June 26 , 2012 in North America and June 29 , 2012 internationally for Microsoft Windows , as well as the Xbox 360 , and PlayStation 3 consoles . It was later released for OS X and Linux in 2013 and 2015 , respectively . It is the 10th title , and a reboot , of the Spec Ops series , and the first entry since Spec Ops : Airborne Commando in 2002 . The game is powered by Unreal Engine 3 . 
 In the game , the player controls Captain Martin Walker , who is sent into a post @-@ catastrophe Dubai with an elite Delta Force team on a reconnaissance mission . As the game progresses , Walker begins experiencing hallucinations and slowly realizes the horror of war . In the game , players can hide behind cover , vault over obstacles , and shoot enemies with a variety of gadgets . Sand is a key gameplay mechanic and can be manipulated to defeat enemies . Throughout the game , players are tasked to make various morally grey decisions . An online multiplayer mode , developed by Darkside Game Studios , is included with the game , allowing players to engage in both co @-@ operative and competitive gameplay . 
 Yager started the game 's development in 2007 taking inspiration for its setting and story framework from various media including Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now . The game was designed to be " physically opposing " causing players to question their thoughts about treating war in a video game as entertainment . The game suffered from multiple delays as the team used this period of time to refine the story and increase gameplay 's pace . The game 's soundtrack is a mix of licensed music and an original music composed by Elia Cmíral . 
 Video game critics gave Spec Ops : The Line generally positive reviews . Praise focused on its narrative and themes , while criticism was targeted particularly at the online multiplayer mode and generic third person gameplay . Spec Ops : The Line was a commercial failure and did not garner the attention publisher 2K Games hoped for , but it was awarded and nominated for several end @-@ of @-@ the year accolades particularly for its story . Yager declared that there would not be a sequel to the game . The game was banned in United Arab Emirates for its depiction of Dubai in a state of destruction . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Spec Ops : The Line is a third @-@ person shooter that follows Captain Martin Walker , who is on a mission to rescue the citizens of Dubai , which has been overrun by sandstorms . The player can select from four difficulty levels : Walk on the Beach , Combat Op , Suicide Mission , and <unk> . A player only gain access to the <unk> level after completing the game with the Suicide Mission difficulty . Various new weapons and equipment become available as the game progresses , some dropped by downed enemies . These include several different rifles , handguns , and machine guns . Some offer alternate firing modes , like attaching a suppressor or using a telescopic sight . As well , there are grenade launchers , hand grenades , and turrets . However , the player can only carry two weapons at a time . Supply caches can be found in different parts of the game , allowing the player to refill their ammo and grenades . Whenever the player successfully shoots an enemy in the head , the game enters a slow @-@ motion mode for a short period of time . The player can also defeat enemies at close range via melee combat . Dying enemies can be executed , which grants the player additional ammo . Hiding behind cover can provide protection and prevents the player from being shot , as well as providing opportunities to <unk> or lean out to shoot enemies . 
 While players can only play as Walker throughout the game , they can issue commands to Sergeant Lugo and Lieutenant Adams , who accompany the player for most of the game . Available commands include focusing fire on one particular target and ordering medical attention for an injured squad member . Adams can defeat enemies by using heavy gadgets or throwing grenades , while Lugo provides sniping assistance . As the game is set in Dubai , sand becomes one of the game 's gameplay mechanics and players can manipulate it at scripted moments in the game , such as triggering a sand avalanche to bury enemies alive . When a grenade explodes on sand , dust clouds that can blind enemies are formed . Sand sometimes opens up new paths to allow players to progress . Environmental hazards like sandstorms occasionally occur , drastically reducing a player 's visibility . 
 The player needs to make moral decisions at certain points during the game , including making choices that determine the fate of both soldiers and civilians . These decisions affect the relationship between Walker and his squad mates , and will cause them to react differently . The game has several subtle effects as the team loses their sanity ; Walker has visual and auditory hallucinations , and his executions of enemies become more violent . As well , the orders and shouts to his team become increasingly angry and ragged in contrast to his original stern command voice . His kill confirmations of enemies degrades from professional in the beginning to psychotic . Similarly , loading screens initially display helpful gameplay hints for the player , but as the game progresses , the text becomes increasingly hostile towards Walker 's actions , and sometimes breaks the fourth wall addressing the player directly . The game features collectibles known as Intel , which are audio logs that provide additional backstory for players . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 Spec Ops : The Line features both co @-@ operative multiplayer and competitive multiplayer mode . Set before the events of the campaign , the competitive multiplayer divides players into two different teams : The Exiles and The Damned . Both teams have their respective perks . Six classes are available for players to choose : Gunner , Medic , Scavenger , <unk> , Sniper and Officer . Each have their own upgrades and advantages . Environmental hazards , including sandstorms , may also occur during a multiplayer match . The game modes featured in the game include : 
 Chaos : A free @-@ for @-@ all mode , in which players eliminate other players . 
 Mutiny : A team deathmatch mode which a team of players eliminates the opposing team . 
 Rally Point : A " King of the Hill " -styled match , in which players secure a rally point and accumulate score for their team . 
 Uplink : Both teams are tasked to capture a central rally point , and disable the opposing team 's COM Station to prevent them from receiving points . 
 Attrition : Players engage in three team elimination rounds with only one life per round and no respawning until the round is over . 
 Buried : A team of players is tasked to destroy the opposing team 's Vital Points , which reveal their High Value Target upon destruction . Players are tasked to eliminate the opposing team 's target in order to win the match . 
 A co @-@ operative mode was added to the game upon its launch . It supports two players and features four missions . Players are tasked to defeat waves of enemies and complete a series of objectives , similar to a horde mode . Similar to the competitive multiplayer mode , the cooperative mode also served as a prequel to the main campaign .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Six months prior to the game 's events the worst series of sandstorms in recorded history began across Dubai in the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) . Dubai 's politicians and wealthy elite downplayed the situation before evacuating secretly , leaving countless Emiratis and foreign migrant workers behind . Colonel John Konrad ( Bruce Boxleitner ) , the decorated but post @-@ traumatic stress disorder @-@ troubled commander of the fictional " Damned 33rd " Infantry Battalion of the United States Army , was returning home with his unit from Afghanistan when the storms struck . Konrad volunteered the Damned 33rd to help relief efforts , then deserted with the entire unit when ordered to abandon the city and its refugees . As the storms intensified , a massive storm wall engulfed Dubai for miles , disrupting surveillance and communication , air travel , and all but the strongest radio broadcasts . The 33rd later returned to Dubai as an occupying force and committed atrocities against the civilian population with the intent of maintaining order . <unk> by this , elements of the 33rd staged a coup d ’ <unk> against Konrad and became exiles . While this was happening , the CIA black ops unit had organized the insurgents to attack both Konrad ’ s loyalist 33rd and the exiles . The 33rd declared martial law , and struggled to maintain order amid 80 mph ( 128 km ) winds , riots , and dwindling resources . The last communication from Dubai stated that the 33rd was attempting to lead a caravan out of the city . The caravan never arrived , and soon afterward , the UAE declared Dubai a no @-@ man 's @-@ land . All travel to the city was barred , the 33rd was publicly disavowed for treason , and no further news left the city . 
 Two weeks before the beginning of the game , a looped radio signal penetrated the wall . Its message was brief : " This is Colonel John Konrad , United States Army . Attempted evacuation of Dubai ended in complete failure . Death toll : too many . " The United States military decides to covertly send in a three @-@ man Delta Force team to carry out reconnaissance . The team , consisting of Captain Martin Walker ( Nolan North ) , Lieutenant <unk> Adams ( Christopher Reid ) , and Staff Sergeant John Lugo ( Omid Abtahi ) , are told to confirm the status of Konrad and any survivors , then radio for extraction . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The game begins in medias res with Walker , Adams , and Lugo aboard a helicopter piloted by Adams , flying over a half @-@ buried Dubai . Other helicopters begin to chase them . Walker attempts to dispatch them with the helicopter 's minigun , however , a sudden sandstorm forms and one of the pursuing helicopters goes out of control and crashes into Adams ' helicopter . 
 The story jumps back to the beginning . Walker , Adams , and Lugo traverse the storm wall to the outskirts of a mostly @-@ buried Dubai on foot . They come in contact with a group of hostile armed survivors , referred to as " insurgents " , who have captured a squad of 33rd soldiers . Contradicting his orders , Walker elects to find out what has happened in the city . Throughout most of their journey , the team hears broadcasts on homemade speakers by the Radioman ( Jake Busey ) , a former journalist turned DJ who speaks on behalf of the 33rd . Walker and the team then learn of the 33rd 's and Konrad 's atrocities . Despite there being clear evidence of Konrad 's unacceptable behavior , Walker is inclined to trust him as he once saved his life in Kabul during a war . 
 The team attempts to intervene peacefully when they come across refugees being rounded up by loyalist 33rd soldiers . However , the soldiers mistake them for CIA operatives and start a firefight . The team then learns that a CIA agent , Daniels ( Rick Pasqualone ) , has been captured by the 33rd and is being interrogated . Arriving to rescue him , they discover that he is dead and that it was a trap set for Gould ( Chris Cox ) , another CIA agent . Gould is later captured and killed , but the team learns that they may get more information at a location called the Gate . Arriving at the Gate , the team uses a mortar loaded with white phosphorus to attack the 33rd , disregarding Lugo 's objection . The team later realizes that the 33rd were only providing shelter for civilians and the mortar accidentally killed 47 civilians . Walker vows revenge on the 33rd , claiming that they forced him to fire the phosphorus . 
 Walker finds a small handheld radio and begins to communicate with whom he believes to be none other than Konrad . Throughout the story , Konrad questions the morality of Walker 's actions over the radio . Shortly afterward , Konrad forces Walker to choose between executing an Emirati survivor or a 33rd soldier , both of whom committed serious crimes . Subsequently , Delta finds CIA agent Jeff Riggs ( Patrick Quinn ) , who is leading a raid on the Underwater Aquatic Coliseum , the city 's last water supply . Learning that destroying it will cripple the 33rd 's operations , the team aids Riggs . However , Riggs destroys the water trucks and reveals that he wanted to wipe out the remaining population of Dubai so that no one would learn of the 33rd 's atrocities , which he feared would cause a full @-@ scale war in the whole region . Riggs , injured and trapped after destroying the water supplies , dies . 
 At this point , the city 's residents face the prospect of dying from dehydration within four days . To organize an evacuation , the team , which is now becoming increasingly hostile toward each other , heads to the Trans @-@ Emirates Building to silence the Radioman and warn the city of the evacuation using the radio . The Radioman surrenders and is shot dead by Lugo . To leave the building , Adams commandeers a UH @-@ 60 Black Hawk helicopter and is tasked by Walker to circle around the radio tower , allowing him to destroy it in hopes of making his intentions clear to Konrad . Other helicopters give chase , leading to the helicopter sequence from the opening of the game ( which Walker seems to remember ) , after which the helicopter crashes in the desert after a sudden sandstorm and one of the pursuing helicopters crashing into the Black Hawk . 
 Waking after the crash , Walker experiences a hallucination of the Burj Khalifa on fire . Reuniting with Adams , Lugo is found lynched by a mob of civilians . When attempts to resuscitate him fail , Walker and Adams either scare the crowd away or kill them in retribution . Walker 's hallucinations became nearly constant , and Adams becomes openly distrustful of his command . Walker and Adams make their way to Burj Khalifa to confront Konrad , but Walker hallucinates Lugo as a Heavy . The two are soon surrounded by the last of Konrad 's men . Walker attempts to surrender to get inside , but an enraged Adams insists on fighting to the death . Walker escapes at the last moment before falling unconscious in gunfire . 
 Awaking , he stumbles to the entrance of the tower and meets Konrad in his penthouse . At first , Konrad appears to be the paranoid , charismatic force behind the atrocities Walker was hoping for , until Walker finds his decaying corpse on the penthouse deck . It is revealed that Walker had been suffering from a dissociative disorder that allowed him to rationalize the actions he had witnessed and carried out . The real Konrad had committed suicide before their arrival in Dubai , while the Konrad that Walker had been in contact with was actually a traumatic hallucination that none of his team saw or heard . This mental projection of Konrad appears to Walker , explaining to him that he had the opportunity to stop , but pushed ahead out of a desire to be a hero . To maintain his ' sanity ' after the white phosphorus strike , many subsequent events in the game were distorted by Walker 's mind to make Konrad look like the villain . With the truth in front of Walker , ' Konrad ' tells him that he must confront the lie he has been living . Pointing a gun at Walker 's head , ' Konrad ' orders Walker to decide who is to blame for events in Dubai , or he will shoot . 
 = = = Endings = = = 
 There are four possible endings . 
 If Walker allows ' Konrad ' to shoot him or shoots himself , his corpse is shown next to Konrad 's . Konrad 's original broadcast then plays as the camera pans over the burning remnants of Dubai and the screen fades to black . 
 However , if Walker shoots ' Konrad ' , he disappears , telling Walker that he can still return home . The remnants of the 33rd who surrendered are shown to be a figment of Walker 's imagination . Walker then uses Konrad 's radio to request an immediate evacuation of Dubai . A post @-@ credits epilogue shows a convoy of Army rescue Humvees locating a <unk> Walker , who is sitting on steps near the Burj Khalifa wearing Konrad ’ s uniform and brandishing an AA @-@ 12 . Walker can either drop the weapon or open fire . 
 If Walker drops his weapon , he then evacuates with the patrol . The screen then fades to white ( indicating a hallucination ) as a soldier remarks that the unit has driven through the entire city looking for Walker and seen the devastation of Dubai . When questioned about how he survived , Walker wearily replies , " Who said I did ... ? " 
 If Walker is killed by the patrol , he is shown dying in a pool of blood while the patrol watches . Walker recalls a conversation between himself and the real Konrad during the War in Afghanistan where he casually remarked about returning home , to which Konrad replied : " Home ? We can 't go home . There 's a line men like us have to cross . If we 're lucky , we do what 's necessary , and then we die . No ... all I really want , Captain , is peace . " 
 If Walker manages to kill the entire patrol , he will pick up and use the patrol 's radio saying , " Gentlemen , welcome to Dubai " , which is one of the first statements Walker said to his team as well as one of the first statements ' Konrad ' said to Walker . Walker then returns to the remains of the Burj Khalifa as the camera pans to a wide shot of the ruined city . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Following the release of several Spec Ops games in the late 1990s and early 2000s , the series was met with low sales and poor reviews , causing a halt to production of successive games . In 2003 , Take @-@ Two mentioned in their financial results that Rockstar Games was working on the franchise but in 2004 the project was canceled . It was later revealed that Rockstar Vancouver was the developer of the canned project with Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme developing the soundtrack for the game . 
 From 2005 to 2009 , the series remained largely unmentioned , with the rights belonging to Take @-@ Two Interactive . In 2006 , German @-@ based Yager Development pitched a cover @-@ based shooter concept for publisher 2K Games who rejected the original concept which featured futuristic soldiers and did not have Dubai as a setting , and offered them a chance to develop a reboot for the Spec Ops series , promising that they would have a lot of creative freedom . Development of the game began in early 2007 , with most elements of the initial game intact . While the game is an installment in the Spec Ops series , the team intentionally avoided using the existing elements of the franchise and chose to use new ideas . 
 = = = Narrative design = = = 
 The developers drew inspiration from multiple media . The set @-@ up and the game 's foundation was inspired by Heart of Darkness , whose story reveals the changes a person undergoes in chaotic times . The relationship between Walker and his squad mates was inspired by HBO 's Generation Kill , and the post @-@ war traumatic experience suffered by Walker was inspired by Jacob 's Ladder . The story of the Tower of Babel was also an inspiration for the game . The story was originally set to be written by several German writers , but they were later replaced by American writers Richard <unk> , who had worked on TimeGate Studios ' Section 8 , and Walt Williams , who had previously worked on other 2K projects including BioShock 2 and Mafia II . One of the game 's core features is violence , but the team hoped that it would not be " cheesy " or excessive . This led the team to focus on creating the game 's storyline to motivate players to take the actions they choose . According to Williams , writing the story became uncomfortable and rough for him as time progressed due to the game 's dark themes . 
 The game was designed to be a third @-@ person shooter so that players can see the three characters ' changes and " evolution " as it progresses , and that the perspective differentiates the game from others shooters in the market . According to Williams , the game was meant to feature narrative gameplay , in which the game was to be played without any cutscene , and the entire story would be told through gameplay sequences only . However , the idea was scrapped as the team realized that having cut scenes helps players to be more emotionally connected and allowed the team to create dramatic scripted sequences . 
 Although the lead player character , Martin Walker , was designed to be as simple as possible in order to help players to engage in the game , and relate to the character , the team gave him some personality which was expressed through his body language and his reactions during the game 's battles . It was felt that by reflecting his emotions to players , they would share them . The squad was designed so that room was left for character development . The transformation of the squad 's mentality serves as an important plot device during the game and has a significant narrative context . The changes in the cleanliness of their clothing , and their reactions toward each other , help to illustrate the story . According to Williams , the hope was that players would start the game with relatively low expectations , or they would consider the game another typical heroic war shooter , then by seeing the transformation of the characters , would be shocked by the game 's narrative and be " engulfed by the darkness " . To make the transformation process clear , the team found it necessary to show the characters ' personality at the beginning of the game in order to create a strong contrast . Gameplay is also a plot device and is tied to the game 's narrative , as players can choose whether or not to execute enemies , which reflects the brutality and horror of war . 
 According to Williams , he believed that most games on the market failed to create a correct representation of the war experience , or express the psychological changes that some combatants experience after participating in a war . He added that a war is not as straightforward and immature as it is portrayed in various shooters . As a result , the game 's theme centers around the moral aspect of war . By using this theme , the team hoped to tell a story and provide an experience that feels realistic , covering the combatants ' mental changes during and after a military conflict , similar to how movies in the 1970s and 1980s , such as Platoon , Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now convey these messages . The team had the intention to give players the opportunity to show that a shooter can also have a decent story capable of invoking emotions . To achieve this , the team simplified their original story setting of having Konrad as a " megalomaniac with messianic delusions " to a setting that is more similar to Heart of Darkness . 
 Spec Ops : The Line features choices for players to make . According to Williams , it was the game 's key concept from the beginning of the game 's development . The game does not feature a morality system , but instead has " moments " and " situations " that give players some freedom . The consequences of some choices were made unclear in an attempt to make them more realistic and to encourage players to explore the other potential options , and to think about the consequences that these choices might bring . According to Williams , these choices were inspired by Fallout 3 and are often between : " what the character knows and what the player would maybe try and do " . To make choices more realistic , and to increase the impact of the story , the team put in a lot of morally grey choices and " bad or worse " decisions . Williams added that absolute good choices are not practical and sometimes may not exist in real @-@ world situations . Combat sequences forced players to make split @-@ second decisions and accept the consequences of their choices . According to Williams , this is something that people frequently do in real @-@ world scenarios , and they must " live with it " after their decision . Williams added that they hoped that the game 's players would have different feelings after making these choices , as this would show that they had created an opportunity for players to examine their own inner emotions , and that they had successfully provided different experiences for players without having a branching storyline . Replay value was also considered when the development team was designing these choices . 
 The game 's moral choices do not have any connection to gameplay , as the team feared that players would view them as gameplay mechanics and disconnect them from the story . The consequences of each choice were designed to be unpredictable to create tension for the player . Both approaches are applied to let players make decisions based on their own will instead of " gaming the system " . Williams also added that they attempted to make violence in the game " meaningful " . While the game 's basic premise is to have the Delta Squad rescue civilians in Dubai , the game by its nature tasks players to kill with their firearms . Therefore , the team added a lot of dialogue to justify and rationalize the characters ' violent actions , creating complex plot points , drama and climaxes . The team also developed banter between enemies in an attempt to humanize them . 
 The game 's theme is heroism , where being a hero may bring more harm than help . During development , there was a point at the beginning of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai . This was cut from the game , as the team found it not effective enough , and it broke a player 's immersion in the game . According to Williams , the choice system was originally similar to Fable II , after a player makes a decision , they cannot reload the game and choose again unless they start a new game . This was later removed due to the game 's structure as a shooter as the team feared that it might cause players to feel frustrated , being stuck in an endless cycle of killing and dying . Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake , as it disrupts the game 's narrative . 
 One of the main goals of the narrative was to depict war in a manner unlike it is portrayed in media such as TV and books . Another goal was to use the scenarios presented to cause players to raise questions about their thoughts of killing people in a video game as a form of entertainment . To achieve this , the team made the hints at the game 's loading screen increasingly aggressive , while the game 's overall narrative was designed with the aim of being " physically opposing " , so that players could project themselves into the protagonist 's position , especially when making choices that involve the killing of innocents . They hoped that players would be able to feel angry at the developers who " forced " players into killing civilians in the game . The development team had a lot of debates regarding the imagery used in depicting violence towards civilians , as many considered it excessive and unnecessary . However , 2K approved their vision even when the team thought they had pushed the narrative to extremes . 
 Williams has stated that the game 's events are open to interpretation . Many other theories and interpretations had been discussed by the development staff . The game 's pacing is described as " deliberate " by Davis , but he added that there are moments where the pacing slows down significantly and allows the player to learn more about the game 's story through inspecting environmental objects . The city of Dubai is filled with graffiti , which is used to give players information regarding the factions and the backstory . According to Yager , the graffiti was designed to give players a perspective that is different from the main game , and to help make the location more realistic . The team also hoped to make players feel lost when playing the game . As a result , the team added hallucination to the game . The team hoped that by using hallucination as a plot device , they could create a snowball effect and engage players more fully in the story as they complete the game . These hallucinations sometimes occur through the subtext , in which players may not realize their presence . Williams added that having subtext is important , and that the " best stories are the ones that have stuff hidden in them " . According to Williams , the game fades to white when the game transitions from one scene to another when the latter is a hallucination created by Walker . 
 = = = General design = = = 
 The game is set in Dubai , which has been ravaged by sandstorms , a story set @-@ up inspired by Davis ' and Williams ' personal experience with heat waves , hurricanes , and sandstorms in Louisiana and Lubbock , as well as a story about a Persian army that vanished in an Egyptian desert in a sandstorm . The two found that the chaotic forces behind sandstorms would help them to convey the message of how fragile humans are , as well as the harshness of war . The team believed that the location provided them with a " fantastic " real @-@ world environment allowing them to produce great visuals . Using Dubai as a setting allowed the game 's levels to have verticality and variety . The development team sent their art directors to Dubai to inspect the local environment . To prevent the game from featuring the typical " dirty , grungy brown environment " , the team added more colors to the game , as well as objects such as glass , marble , gold , and crystals to make the location look vivid and vibrant . 
 Using Dubai as a setting allowed them to incorporate sand as part of the game 's key mechanics . Davis described the Dubai in the game as " a mix of fantasy and real @-@ world environment " . To prevent the sand mechanics from turning gimmicky , the team introduced multiple ways for players to use sand as a weapon , such as the player 's ability to trigger dust clouds by throwing grenades on sand and cause a sand avalanche by shooting weak structures and supports . In addition , the team added several scripted sequences regarding sand to keep the game dynamic . The occurrence of these moments were decided based on the game 's production value . The team also consulted Wil <unk> for military advice . 
 The game featured advanced artificial intelligence due to the inclusion of the game 's squad command system . Adams and Lugo will assist Walker in battles and react to the battle situation accordingly even if they are not given any orders . They will also analyse the situation when instructed and decide the best approach to defeat enemies . The battle command system was designed to be accessible and easy to use , so that players would not have to spend a lot of time managing the squad . Lugo and Adams may get severely injured and if both of them die , the game ends . This mechanic prompts the player to rescue them as quickly as possible , and the system is designed to create tense situations . The AI for enemies is affected by various factors , including visibility and hearing . 
 = = = Audio = = = 
 The team did research on weapon sounds by consulting several military experts . The team spent a lot of time dealing with the audio mixing , so that the resulting sounds would not interfere with the narrative . To make the game 's script unique , the team added more variety to character lines during gameplay moments , and had these lines correspond to scenarios the characters were facing in the game . Elia Cmíral was hired to compose the music for the game , and the soundtrack was described as " unearthly " and " rock @-@ orientated " . To establish the character of the Radioman , the team added licensed music , including Martha and the Vandellas ' " Nowhere to Run " and Mogwai 's " Glasgow Mega @-@ Snake " . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 Although Spec Ops : The Line has a strong single @-@ player focus , it also features multiplayer components . Yager was only responsible for the game 's single @-@ player ; the multiplayer was outsourced to Darkside Game Studios . The multiplayer team at 2K Games , which previously developed the multiplayer of BioShock 2 , also assisted in creating multiplayer classes . 
 According to Davis , while 2K Games was supportive of Yager and its campaign , they insisted that the game must have multiplayer components to boost its sales . This was a decision that Yager thought would hurt the game . Davis described the project as a " waste of money " , and a " low @-@ quality Call of Duty clone " . The president of Darkside Game Studios , Hugh Falk , responded by calling Davis ' opinion " outlying " . He added that Darkside participated in the project towards the end of the game 's development cycle and that they had to revamp the entire multiplayer system within tight deadlines . Davis later claimed that his comments were not directed to Darkside Game Studios and that he is satisfied with their final product after a long and troubled development cycle . 
 The game originally did not have a cooperative multiplayer mode , as the team thought that it would cause distractions when players are playing the game 's tonally darker levels , and that it did not match the game 's narrative " . However , a cooperative mode was added to the game in August 2012 as free downloadable content ; it does not follow the storyline of the campaign . 
 = = Release and marketing = = 
 On December 12 , 2009 , a ninth game in the series was announced at the Spike Video Game Awards ; a trailer depicted several minutes of gameplay and showed off the setting . A subsequent press release detailed the premise , other game features , and a possible 2011 release date . An official site was soon launched , and a new trailer was released in November 2011 . The game was later delayed to the first or second quarter of 2012 , before the fixed release date was announced . Spec Ops : The Line was released on June 26 , 2012 for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . It was released on March 13 , 2014 for OS X. This version of the game was developed by Digital Tribe Games . 
 No more news about the game was made available for 18 months during the game 's development cycle . Davis thought the game was announced too early , which caused excitement for it to die down . The developer carried out focus tests during this period and the gameplay was found to be too slow @-@ paced which would lower its competitiveness with other shooters such as Call of Duty . As a result , the team spent time to speed up the game 's action . 
 In addition to the game 's standard edition , players could purchase a Premium Edition at a higher price . Players who pre @-@ ordered the game at selected retailers were able to have their games upgraded to the Premium Edition at no additional cost . The Premium Edition grants players additional advantages in the multiplayer segment of the game , including experience points boost and early access to the Officer class . A multiplayer beta for selected applicants on the Xbox 360 platform was held in 2010 . A playable demo of the game , which featured two chapters from the beginning of the campaign , was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on May 8 , 2012 . 
 According to Williams , the game was difficult to market , as the team wanted to prevent spoiling the its story and narrative while encouraging people to buy the game . He added that the demo they had created was unrepresentative of the final game . Williams expected the game to be sold through word of mouth promotion and that it would become a cult classic . 
 = = Reception = = 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Reviews of Spec Ops : The Line were mostly positive , with many critics praising the narrative , themes , and the provocative take on violence in video games , but noted that it failed to innovate or present a strong multiplayer component . The game was considered to be underrated by many critics . Previews of the game , and the final game was banned in United Arab Emirates for its depiction of Dubai in a state of destruction . 
 The overall gameplay received mixed reviews . Some critics believed that the game 's gameplay was enjoyable , serviceable and acceptable by modern standards , but most agreed that some of the gameplay mechanics , such as the cover system , lacked polish and was flawed . Some critics considered the gameplay generic due to its inclusion of typical shooter elements such as on @-@ rail and turret segments , and stated that such mechanics are unable to help the game differentiate itself from other shooters such as Gears of War , and give the game an identity crisis . Some critics lamented that gameplay occasionally disconnects players from the story , creating annoyance . Many criticized the game for not having a roll mechanic . The artificial intelligence system was criticized for not being strong enough to make the game more gratifying , though some critics thought that the AI system for Adams and Lugo was well @-@ crafted and did not suffer from severe or frequent technical problems , although they may not be able to carry out player 's commands . Some critics criticized the game 's low replay value , unbalanced difficulty level , and sudden difficulty spike . 
 The graphics and art design of the game was praised . Brandon Justice from Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that he expected the game to look " bland " due to the its setting , but he was surprised at how much variety and color there was in the game . The game 's level design and vibrant colors were also praised . Critics agreed that the game 's setting , Dubai , was excellent and well @-@ realized ; some critics praised Yager for adding different details to the game 's world . The terrain and landscape was praised for being interesting , unique , and creating " fantastic set piece battles " . Some commented that the sand mechanic sometimes became gimmicky . Many criticized the game 's poor textures and the poor rendering of cutscenes . 
 The game 's overall narrative was praised by critics ; many considered it compelling , engaging , riveting , and mature , and viewed it as the standout feature of the game . Some believed that the story had an excellent presentation with decent voice @-@ acting , memorable characters , and atmospheric soundtracks . Many critics thought it was a bold attempt by Yager and that the story about mistakes and consequences allowed the game 's narrative to exceed its competitors in terms of quality . Some critics believed that Yager should be respected for successfully creating a message through the story and delivering it to the player , and trying to do something different . Mitch Dyer of IGN thought that the game 's narrative made violence " meaningful " , and that the story was unexpectedly good and personal . Some believed the story is impactful and at times shocking , and that the plot would make " Modern Warfare 2 's nefarious No Russian look pretty tame " . The game 's choices were praised for being " powerful " despite not offering a branching storyline . Some critics believed that these choices are provocative , organic , impactful , upsetting , and thematically correct though unsatisfying and sometimes hollow and binary . The endings of the game were praised , though some felt that there are some plotholes in the story . Some critics noted that emotionally Spec Ops : The Line is not a pleasant game . 
 The multiplayer received mixed reviews . Justice appreciated the upgrade system , as he thought that it had successfully encouraged teamwork . Dyer added that the multiplayer is unremarkable and uninspiring , despite saying that the Buried mode created a tense experience . Many critics believed that this mode is not worthwhile , and can only served as a distraction . Arthur Gies from Polygon noted that the multiplayer component suffers from technical issues such as freezing and glitches , as well as issues with player 's conduct such as cheating in matches . 
 Critics have pointed out that the " mechanics " of the game — the actions available to the player , and the responses resulting from said actions — contrast pointedly with many mechanics of popular FPS games , and that the game deliberately used shooter genre clichés in order to illustrate how ludicrous they are in comparison to real warfare . In particular contrast to other games of its kind , some critics believe that Spec Ops : The Line does not intend the combat to be a fun experience for the player , but rather aims to engage the player through its narrative which critiques the shooter genre for being removed from reality and providing players with an unrealistic , morally dichotomous , escapist fantasy . The white phosphorus strike scene has been the subject of much scrutiny and was described as " troubling " due to images such as the corpse of a mother clutching her child . In response to complaints that the massacre was unnecessary or exploitative , Williams justified the scene by saying that the plot device was intended to evoke players ' anger , and that one of the game 's endings is simply for the player to put the controller down and stop playing .

 The game debuted in No. 3 in the UK retail chart during the game 's first week of release , behind Lego Batman 2 : DC Super Heroes and The Amazing Spider @-@ Man . Spec Ops : The Line was a commercial failure , selling less than anticipated . The sales of Spec Ops : The Line , combined with Max Payne 3 , was lower than the combined sales of L.A. Noire and Duke Nukem Forever . The low sales of the title contributed to Take @-@ Two 's disappointing financial results in fiscal year 2013 .

 Spec Ops : The Line was nominated for Best Shooter , and the White Phosphorus scene was nominated for Best Gaming Moments at the Golden Joystick Awards . At the 2012 Inside Gaming Awards , the game won for Best Narrative and was nominated for Best Game Cinematography . At IGN 's Best of 2012 Awards , the game won for Best PC Story and Best PS3 Story , and also received nominations for Best Overall Story , Best PS3 Action Game , Best Xbox 360 Shooter Game , and Best Xbox 360 Story . It was nominated for Outstanding Achievement in Story at the 16th D.I.C.E. Awards . 
 = = Future = = 
 According to Yager Development , 2K never discussed the chance of developing a sequel during the game 's development . Timo Ullman , managing director of Yager stated that the game failed to compete with other shooters , and that market for games like Spec Ops : The Line is too small . As a result , the team would not return to the franchise . Team members expressed a desire to move on and develop a game that has a much lighter tone . 
 = Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease = 
 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by long term poor airflow . The main symptoms include shortness of breath and cough with sputum production . COPD typically worsens over time . Eventually walking up stairs or carrying things will be difficult . Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are older terms used for different types of COPD . The term " chronic bronchitis " is still used to define a productive cough that is present for at least three months each year for two years . 
 Tobacco smoking is the most common cause of COPD , with a number of other factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role . In the developing world , one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires . Long @-@ term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue . The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests . In contrast to asthma , the airflow reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator . 
 Most cases of COPD can be prevented by reducing exposure to risk factors . This includes decreasing rates of smoking and improving indoor and outdoor air quality . While treatment can slow worsening there is no cure . COPD treatments include stopping smoking , vaccinations , respiratory rehabilitation , and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids . Some people may benefit from long @-@ term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation . In those who have periods of acute worsening , increased use of medications and hospitalization may be needed . 
 As of 2013 COPD affects 329 million people or nearly 5 percent of the global population . It typically occurs in people over the age of 40 . Males and females are affected equally commonly . In 2013 it resulted in 2 @.@ 9 million deaths , up from 2 @.@ 4 million deaths in 1990 . More than 90 % of these deaths occur in the developing world . The number of deaths is projected to increase further because of higher smoking rates and an aging population in many countries . It resulted in an estimated economic cost of $ 2 @.@ 1 trillion in 2010 . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 The most common symptoms of COPD are sputum production , shortness of breath , and a productive cough . These symptoms are present for a prolonged period of time and typically worsen over time . It is unclear if different types of COPD exist . While previously divided into emphysema and chronic bronchitis , emphysema is only a description of lung changes rather than a disease itself , and chronic bronchitis is simply a descriptor of symptoms that may or may not occur with COPD . 
 = = = Cough = = = 
 A chronic cough is often the first symptom to develop . When it persists for more than three months each year for at least two years , in combination with sputum production and without another explanation , there is by definition chronic bronchitis . This condition can occur before COPD fully develops . The amount of sputum produced can change over hours to days . In some cases , the cough may not be present or may only occur occasionally and may not be productive . Some people with COPD attribute the symptoms to a " smoker 's cough " . <unk> may be swallowed or spat out , depending often on social and cultural factors . Vigorous coughing may lead to rib fractures or a brief loss of consciousness . Those with COPD often have a history of " common colds " that last a long time . 
 = = = Shortness of breath = = = 
 Shortness of breath is often the symptom that most bothers people . It is commonly described as : " my breathing requires effort , " " I feel out of breath , " or " I can 't get enough air in " . Different terms , however , may be used in different cultures . Typically the shortness of breath is worse on exertion of a prolonged duration and worsens over time . In the advanced stages , it occurs during rest and may be always present . It is a source of both anxiety and a poor quality of life in those with COPD . Many people with more advanced COPD breathe through pursed lips and this action can improve shortness of breath in some . 
 = = = Other features = = = 
 In COPD , it may take longer to breathe out than to breathe in . Chest tightness may occur but is not common and may be caused by another problem . Those with obstructed airflow may have wheezing or decreased sounds with air entry on examination of the chest with a stethoscope . A barrel chest is a characteristic sign of COPD , but is relatively uncommon . Tripod positioning may occur as the disease worsens . 
 Advanced COPD leads to high pressure on the lung arteries , which strains the right ventricle of the heart . This situation is referred to as cor pulmonale , and leads to symptoms of leg swelling and bulging neck veins . COPD is more common than any other lung disease as a cause of cor pulmonale . Cor pulmonale has become less common since the use of supplemental oxygen . 
 COPD often occurs along with a number of other conditions , due in part to shared risk factors . These conditions include ischemic heart disease , high blood pressure , diabetes mellitus , muscle wasting , osteoporosis , lung cancer , anxiety disorder and depression . In those with severe disease , a feeling of always being tired is common . <unk> clubbing is not specific to COPD and should prompt investigations for an underlying lung cancer . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 An acute exacerbation of COPD is defined as increased shortness of breath , increased sputum production , a change in the color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow , or an increase in cough in someone with COPD . This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing , a fast heart rate , sweating , active use of muscles in the neck , a bluish tinge to the skin , and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations . <unk> may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope . 
 = = Cause = = 
 The primary cause of COPD is tobacco smoke , with occupational exposure and pollution from indoor fires being significant causes in some countries . Typically these exposures must occur over several decades before symptoms develop . A person 's genetic makeup also affects the risk . 
 = = = Smoking = = = 
 The primary risk factor for COPD globally is tobacco smoking . Of those who smoke about 20 % will get COPD , and of those who are lifelong smokers about half will get COPD . In the United States and United Kingdom , of those with COPD , 80 – 95 % are either current smokers or previously smoked . The likelihood of developing COPD increases with the total smoke exposure . Additionally , women are more susceptible to the harmful effects of smoke than men . In non @-@ smokers , secondhand smoke is the cause of about 20 % of cases . Other types of smoke , such as marijuana , cigar , and water pipe smoke , also confer a risk . Women who smoke during pregnancy may increase the risk of COPD in their child . 
 = = = Air pollution = = = 
 Poorly ventilated cooking fires , often fueled by coal or biomass fuels such as wood and animal dung , lead to indoor air pollution and are one of the most common causes of COPD in developing countries . These fires are a method of cooking and heating for nearly 3 billion people with their health effects being greater among women due to more exposure . They are used as the main source of energy in 80 % of homes in India , China and sub @-@ Saharan Africa . 
 People who live in large cities have a higher rate of COPD compared to people who live in rural areas . While urban air pollution is a contributing factor in exacerbations , its overall role as a cause of COPD is unclear . Areas with poor outdoor air quality , including that from exhaust gas , generally have higher rates of COPD . The overall effect in relation to smoking , however , is believed to be small . 
 = = = Occupational exposures = = = 
 Intense and prolonged exposure to workplace dusts , chemicals and fumes increase the risk of COPD in both smokers and nonsmokers . Workplace exposures are believed to be the cause in 10 – 20 % of cases . In the United States they are believed to be related to more than 30 % of cases among those who have never smoked and probably represent a greater risk in countries without sufficient regulations . 
 A number of industries and sources have been implicated , including high levels of dust in coal mining , gold mining , and the cotton textile industry , occupations involving cadmium and <unk> , and fumes from welding . Working in agriculture is also a risk . In some professions the risks have been estimated as equivalent to that of one half to two packs of cigarettes a day . Silica dust exposure can also lead to COPD , with the risk unrelated to that for silicosis . The negative effects of dust exposure and cigarette smoke exposure appear to be additive or possibly more than additive . 
 = = = Genetics = = = 
 Genetics play a role in the development of COPD . It is more common among relatives of those with COPD who smoke than unrelated smokers . Currently , the only clearly inherited risk factor is alpha 1 @-@ antitrypsin deficiency ( AAT ) . This risk is particularly high if someone deficient in alpha 1 @-@ antitrypsin also smokes . It is responsible for about 1 – 5 % of cases and the condition is present in about 3 – 4 in 10 @,@ 000 people . Other genetic factors are being investigated , of which there are likely to be many . 
 = = = Other = = = 
 A number of other factors are less closely linked to COPD . The risk is greater in those who are poor , although it is not clear if this is due to poverty itself or other risk factors associated with poverty , such as air pollution and malnutrition . There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway <unk> are at increased risk of COPD . Birth factors such as low birth weight may also play a role as do a number of infectious diseases including HIV / AIDS and tuberculosis . Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD , at least in adults . 
 = = = Exacerbations = = = 
 An acute exacerbation ( a sudden worsening of symptoms ) is commonly triggered by infection or environmental pollutants , or sometimes by other factors such as improper use of medications . Infections appear to be the cause of 50 to 75 % of cases , with bacteria in 25 % , viruses in 25 % , and both in 25 % . Environmental pollutants include both poor indoor and outdoor air quality . Exposure to personal smoke and secondhand smoke increases the risk . Cold temperature may also play a role , with exacerbations occurring more commonly in winter . Those with more severe underlying disease have more frequent exacerbations : in mild disease 1 @.@ 8 per year , moderate 2 to 3 per year , and severe 3 @.@ 4 per year . Those with many exacerbations have a faster rate of deterioration of their lung function . Pulmonary emboli ( blood clots in the lungs ) can worsen symptoms in those with pre @-@ existing COPD . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 COPD is a type of obstructive lung disease in which chronic incompletely reversible poor airflow ( airflow limitation ) and inability to breathe out fully ( air trapping ) exist . The poor airflow is the result of breakdown of lung tissue ( known as emphysema ) and small airways disease ( known as obstructive bronchiolitis ) . The relative contributions of these two factors vary between people . Severe destruction of small airways can lead to the formation of large air pockets — known as bullae — that replace lung tissue . This form of disease is called bullous emphysema . 
 COPD develops as a significant and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants . Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state . The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages , two types of white blood cell . Those who smoke additionally have <unk> lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement similar to that in asthma . Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as <unk> factors . Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells , and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors . The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema , which then contributes to the poor airflow and , finally , poor absorption and release of respiratory gases . General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood . 
 Narrowing of the airways occurs due to inflammation and scarring within them . This contributes to the inability to breathe out fully . The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out , as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time . This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the lungs when the next breath is started , resulting in an increase in the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time , a process called hyperinflation or air trapping . Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD , as it is less comfortable to breathe in when the lungs are already partly full . Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation . 
 Some also have a degree of airway <unk> to irritants similar to those found in asthma . 
 Low oxygen levels and , eventually , high carbon dioxide levels in the blood can occur from poor gas exchange due to decreased ventilation from airway obstruction , hyperinflation and a reduced desire to breathe . During exacerbations , airway inflammation is also increased , resulting in increased hyperinflation , reduced expiratory airflow and worsening of gas transfer . This can also lead to insufficient ventilation and , eventually , low blood oxygen levels . Low oxygen levels , if present for a prolonged period , can result in narrowing of the arteries in the lungs , while emphysema leads to breakdown of capillaries in the lungs . Both these changes result in increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries , which may cause cor pulmonale . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 The diagnosis of COPD should be considered in anyone over the age of 35 to 40 who has shortness of breath , a chronic cough , sputum production , or frequent winter colds and a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease . Spirometry is then used to confirm the diagnosis . Screening those without symptoms is not recommended . 
 = = = Spirometry = = = 
 Spirometry measures the amount of airflow obstruction present and is generally carried out after the use of a bronchodilator , a medication to open up the airways . Two main components are measured to make the diagnosis : the forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV1 ) , which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in the first second of a breath , and the forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in a single large breath . Normally , 75 – 80 % of the FVC comes out in the first second and a FEV1 / FVC ratio of less than 70 % in someone with symptoms of COPD defines a person as having the disease . Based on these measurements , spirometry would lead to over @-@ diagnosis of COPD in the elderly . The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria additionally require a FEV1 of less than 80 % of predicted . 
 Evidence for using spirometry among those without symptoms in an effort to diagnose the condition earlier is of uncertain effect and is therefore currently not recommended . A peak expiratory flow ( the maximum speed of expiration ) , commonly used in asthma , is not sufficient for the diagnosis of COPD . 
 = = = Severity = = = 
 There are a number of methods to determine how much COPD is affecting a given individual . The modified British Medical Research Council questionnaire ( <unk> ) or the COPD assessment test ( CAT ) are simple questionnaires that may be used to determine the severity of symptoms . Scores on CAT range from 0 – 40 with the higher the score , the more severe the disease . Spirometry may help to determine the severity of airflow limitation . This is typically based on the FEV1 expressed as a percentage of the predicted " normal " for the person 's age , gender , height and weight . Both the American and European guidelines recommended partly basing treatment recommendations on the FEV1 . The GOLD guidelines suggest dividing people into four categories based on symptoms assessment and airflow limitation . Weight loss and muscle weakness , as well as the presence of other diseases , should also be taken into account . 
 = = = Other tests = = = 
 A chest X @-@ ray and complete blood count may be useful to exclude other conditions at the time of diagnosis . Characteristic signs on X @-@ ray are <unk> lungs , a flattened diaphragm , increased <unk> airspace , and bullae while it can help exclude other lung diseases , such as pneumonia , pulmonary edema or a pneumothorax . A high @-@ resolution computed tomography scan of the chest may show the distribution of emphysema throughout the lungs and can also be useful to exclude other lung diseases . Unless surgery is planned , however , this rarely affects management . An analysis of arterial blood is used to determine the need for oxygen ; this is recommended in those with an FEV1 less than 35 % predicted , those with a peripheral oxygen saturation of less than 92 % and those with symptoms of congestive heart failure . In areas of the world where alpha @-@ 1 antitrypsin deficiency is common , people with COPD ( particularly those below the age of 45 and with emphysema affecting the lower parts of the lungs ) should be considered for testing . 
 = = = Differential diagnosis = = = 
 COPD may need to be differentiated from other causes of shortness of breath such as congestive heart failure , pulmonary embolism , pneumonia or pneumothorax . Many people with COPD mistakenly think they have asthma . The distinction between asthma and COPD is made on the basis of the symptoms , smoking history , and whether airflow limitation is reversible with bronchodilators at spirometry . Tuberculosis may also present with a chronic cough and should be considered in locations where it is common . Less common conditions that may present similarly include bronchopulmonary dysplasia and obliterative bronchiolitis . Chronic bronchitis may occur with normal airflow and in this situation it is not classified as COPD . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 Most cases of COPD are potentially preventable through decreasing exposure to smoke and improving air quality . Annual influenza vaccinations in those with COPD reduce exacerbations , hospitalizations and death . <unk> vaccination may also be beneficial . 
 = = = Smoking cessation = = = 
 Keeping people from starting smoking is a key aspect of preventing COPD . The policies of governments , public health agencies , and anti @-@ smoking organizations can reduce smoking rates by discouraging people from starting and encouraging people to stop smoking . Smoking bans in public areas and places of work are important measures to decrease exposure to secondhand smoke and while many places have instituted bans more are recommended . 
 In those who smoke , stopping smoking is the only measure shown to slow down the worsening of COPD . Even at a late stage of the disease , it can reduce the rate of worsening lung function and delay the onset of disability and death . Smoking cessation starts with the decision to stop smoking , leading to an attempt at quitting . Often several attempts are required before long @-@ term abstinence is achieved . Attempts over 5 years lead to success in nearly 40 % of people . 
 Some smokers can achieve long @-@ term smoking cessation through willpower alone . Smoking , however , is highly addictive , and many smokers need further support . The chance of quitting is improved with social support , engagement in a smoking cessation program and the use of medications such as nicotine replacement therapy , bupropion or <unk> . 
 = = = Occupational health = = = 
 A number of measures have been taken to reduce the likelihood that workers in at @-@ risk industries — such as coal mining , construction and stonemasonry — will develop COPD . Examples of these measures include : the creation of public policy , education of workers and management about the risks , promoting smoking cessation , checking workers for early signs of COPD , use of respirators , and dust control . Effective dust control can be achieved by improving ventilation , using water sprays and by using mining techniques that minimize dust generation . If a worker develops COPD , further lung damage can be reduced by avoiding ongoing dust exposure , for example by changing the work role . 
 = = = Air pollution = = = 
 Both indoor and outdoor air quality can be improved , which may prevent COPD or slow the worsening of existing disease . This may be achieved by public policy efforts , cultural changes , and personal involvement . 
 A number of developed countries have successfully improved outdoor air quality through regulations . This has resulted in improvements in the lung function of their populations . Those with COPD may experience fewer symptoms if they stay indoors on days when outdoor air quality is poor . 
 One key effort is to reduce exposure to smoke from cooking and heating fuels through improved ventilation of homes and better stoves and chimneys . Proper stoves may improve indoor air quality by 85 % . Using alternative energy sources such as solar cooking and electrical heating is also effective . Using fuels such as kerosene or coal might be less bad than traditional biomass such as wood or dung . 
 = = Management = = 
 There is no known cure for COPD , but the symptoms are treatable and its progression can be delayed . The major goals of management are to reduce risk factors , manage stable COPD , prevent and treat acute exacerbations , and manage associated illnesses . The only measures that have been shown to reduce mortality are smoking cessation and supplemental oxygen . Stopping smoking decreases the risk of death by 18 % . Other recommendations include influenza vaccination once a year , pneumococcal vaccination once every 5 years , and reduction in exposure to environmental air pollution . In those with advanced disease , palliative care may reduce symptoms , with morphine improving the feelings of shortness of breath . Noninvasive ventilation may be used to support breathing . 
 = = = Exercise = = = 
 Pulmonary rehabilitation is a program of exercise , disease management and counseling , coordinated to benefit the individual . In those who have had a recent exacerbation , pulmonary rehabilitation appears to improve the overall quality of life and the ability to exercise , and reduce mortality . It has also been shown to improve the sense of control a person has over their disease , as well as their emotions . Breathing exercises in and of themselves appear to have a limited role . <unk> lip breathing exercises may be useful . 
 Being either underweight or overweight can affect the symptoms , degree of disability and prognosis of COPD . People with COPD who are underweight can improve their breathing muscle strength by increasing their calorie intake . When combined with regular exercise or a pulmonary rehabilitation program , this can lead to improvements in COPD symptoms . Supplemental nutrition may be useful in those who are malnourished . 
 = = = Bronchodilators = = = 
 Inhaled bronchodilators are the primary medications used and result in a small overall benefit . There are two major types , β2 agonists and anticholinergics ; both exist in long @-@ acting and short @-@ acting forms . They reduce shortness of breath , wheeze and exercise limitation , resulting in an improved quality of life . It is unclear if they change the progression of the underlying disease . 
 In those with mild disease , short @-@ acting agents are recommended on an as needed basis . In those with more severe disease , long @-@ acting agents are recommended . Long acting agents partly work by improving hyperinflation . If long @-@ acting bronchodilators are insufficient , then inhaled corticosteroids are typically added . With respect to long @-@ acting agents , it is unclear if tiotropium ( a long @-@ acting anticholinergic ) or long @-@ acting beta agonists ( LABAs ) are better , and it may be worth trying each and continuing the one that worked best . Both types of agent appear to reduce the risk of acute exacerbations by 15 – 25 % . While both may be used at the same time , any benefit is of questionable significance . 
 There are several short @-@ acting β2 agonists available including salbutamol ( <unk> ) and <unk> . They provide some relief of symptoms for four to six hours . Long @-@ acting β2 agonists such as <unk> and <unk> are often used as maintenance therapy . Some feel the evidence of benefits is limited while others view the evidence of benefit as established . Long @-@ term use appears safe in COPD with adverse effects include shakiness and heart palpitations . When used with inhaled steroids they increase the risk of pneumonia . While steroids and LABAs may work better together , it is unclear if this slight benefit outweighs the increased risks . 
 There are two main anticholinergics used in COPD , ipratropium and tiotropium . <unk> is a short @-@ acting agent while tiotropium is long @-@ acting . <unk> is associated with a decrease in exacerbations and improved quality of life , and tiotropium provides those benefits better than ipratropium . It does not appear to affect mortality or the overall hospitalization rate . <unk> can cause dry mouth and urinary tract symptoms . They are also associated with increased risk of heart disease and stroke . <unk> , another long acting agent which came to market in 2012 , has been used as an alternative to tiotropium . 
 = = = Corticosteroids = = = 
 Corticosteroids are usually used in inhaled form but may also be used as tablets to treat and prevent acute exacerbations . While inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS ) have not shown benefit for people with mild COPD , they decrease acute exacerbations in those with either moderate or severe disease . By themselves they have no effect on overall one @-@ year mortality . It is unclear if they affect the progression of the disease . When used in combination with a LABA they may decrease mortality compared to either ICS or LABA alone . Inhaled steroids are associated with increased rates of pneumonia . Long @-@ term treatment with steroid tablets is associated with significant side effects . 
 = = = Other medication = = = 
 Long @-@ term antibiotics , specifically those from the macrolide class such as erythromycin , reduce the frequency of exacerbations in those who have two or more a year . This practice may be cost effective in some areas of the world . Concerns include that of antibiotic resistance and hearing problems with azithromycin . <unk> such as theophylline generally cause more harm than benefit and thus are usually not recommended , but may be used as a second @-@ line agent in those not controlled by other measures . <unk> may help to reduce exacerbations in some people with chronic bronchitis . Cough medicines are not recommended . 
 = = = Oxygen = = = 
 Supplemental oxygen is recommended in those with low oxygen levels at rest ( a partial pressure of oxygen of less than 50 – 55 mmHg or oxygen saturations of less than 88 % ) . In this group of people it decreases the risk of heart failure and death if used 15 hours per day and may improve people 's ability to exercise . In those with normal or mildly low oxygen levels , oxygen supplementation may improve shortness of breath . There is a risk of fires and little benefit when those on oxygen continue to smoke . In this situation some recommend against its use . During acute exacerbations , many require oxygen therapy ; the use of high concentrations of oxygen without taking into account a person 's oxygen saturations may lead to increased levels of carbon dioxide and worsened outcomes . In those at high risk of high carbon dioxide levels , oxygen saturations of 88 – 92 % are recommended , while for those without this risk recommended levels are 94 – 98 % . 
 = = = Surgery = = = 
 For those with very severe disease , surgery is sometimes helpful and may include lung transplantation or lung volume reduction surgery . Lung volume reduction surgery involves removing the parts of the lung most damaged by emphysema allowing the remaining , relatively good lung to expand and work better . Lung transplantation is sometimes performed for very severe COPD , particularly in younger individuals . 
 = = = Exacerbations = = = 
 Acute exacerbations are typically treated by increasing the usage of short @-@ acting bronchodilators . This commonly includes a combination of a short @-@ acting inhaled beta agonist and anticholinergic . These medications can be given either via a metered @-@ dose inhaler with a spacer or via a <unk> with both appearing to be equally effective . <unk> may be easier for those who are more unwell . 
 Oral corticosteroids improve the chance of recovery and decrease the overall duration of symptoms . They work equally well as intravenous steroids but appear to have fewer side effects . Five days of steroids work as well as ten or fourteen . In those with a severe exacerbation , antibiotics improve outcomes . A number of different antibiotics may be used including amoxicillin , doxycycline and azithromycin ; it is unclear if one is better than the others . The FDA recommends against the use of fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects . There is no clear evidence for those with less severe cases . 
 For those with type 2 respiratory failure ( acutely raised CO2 levels ) non @-@ invasive positive pressure ventilation decreases the probability of death or the need of intensive care admission . Additionally , theophylline may have a role in those who do not respond to other measures . Fewer than 20 % of exacerbations require hospital admission . In those without acidosis from respiratory failure , home care ( " hospital at home " ) may be able to help avoid some admissions . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 COPD usually gets gradually worse over time and can ultimately result in death . It is estimated that 3 % of all disability is related to COPD . The proportion of disability from COPD globally has decreased from 1990 to 2010 due to improved indoor air quality primarily in Asia . The overall number of years lived with disability from COPD , however , has increased . 
 The rate at which COPD worsens varies with the presence of factors that predict a poor outcome , including severe airflow obstruction , little ability to exercise , shortness of breath , significantly underweight or overweight , congestive heart failure , continued smoking , and frequent exacerbations . Long @-@ term outcomes in COPD can be estimated using the <unk> index which gives a score of zero to ten depending on FEV1 , body @-@ mass index , the distance walked in six minutes , and the modified MRC dyspnea scale . Significant weight loss is a bad sign . Results of spirometry are also a good predictor of the future progress of the disease but not as good as the <unk> index . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Globally , as of 2010 , COPD affected approximately 329 million people ( 4 @.@ 8 % of the population ) . The disease affects men and women almost equally , as there has been increased tobacco use among women in the developed world . The increase in the developing world between 1970 and the 2000s is believed to be related to increasing rates of smoking in this region , an increasing population and an aging population due to fewer deaths from other causes such as infectious diseases . Some developed countries have seen increased rates , some have remained stable and some have seen a decrease in COPD prevalence . The global numbers are expected to continue increasing as risk factors remain common and the population continues to get older . 
 Between 1990 and 2010 the number of deaths from COPD decreased slightly from 3 @.@ 1 million to 2 @.@ 9 million and became the fourth leading cause of death . In 2012 it became the third leading cause as the number of deaths rose again to 3 @.@ 1 million . In some countries , mortality has decreased in men but increased in women . This is most likely due to rates of smoking in women and men becoming more similar . COPD is more common in older people ; it affects 34 – 200 out of 1000 people older than 65 years , depending on the population under review . 
 In England , an estimated 0 @.@ 84 million people ( of 50 million ) have a diagnosis of COPD ; this translates into approximately one person in 59 receiving a diagnosis of COPD at some point in their lives . In the most socioeconomically deprived parts of the country , one in 32 people were diagnosed with COPD , compared with one in 98 in the most affluent areas . In the United States approximately 6 @.@ 3 % of the adult population , totaling approximately 15 million people , have been diagnosed with COPD . 25 million people may have COPD if currently undiagnosed cases are included . In 2011 , there were approximately 730 @,@ 000 hospitalizations in the United States for COPD . In the United State , COPD , is estimated to be the third leading cause of death in 2011 . 
 = = History = = 
 The word " emphysema " is derived from the Greek <unk> <unk> meaning " inflate " <unk> composed of ἐν en , meaning " in " , and <unk> <unk> , meaning " breath , blast " . The term chronic bronchitis came into use in 1808 while the term COPD is believed to have first been used in 1965 . Previously it has been known by a number of different names , including chronic obstructive bronchopulmonary disease , chronic obstructive respiratory disease , chronic airflow obstruction , chronic airflow limitation , chronic obstructive lung disease , nonspecific chronic pulmonary disease , and diffuse obstructive pulmonary syndrome . The terms chronic bronchitis and emphysema were formally defined in 1959 at the <unk> guest symposium and in 1962 at the American Thoracic Society Committee meeting on Diagnostic Standards . 
 Early descriptions of probable emphysema include : in 1679 by T. Bonet of a condition of " voluminous lungs " and in 1769 by Giovanni Morgagni of lungs which were " turgid particularly from air " . In 1721 the first drawings of emphysema were made by <unk> . These were followed with pictures by Matthew Baillie in 1789 and descriptions of the destructive nature of the condition . In 1814 Charles Badham used " catarrh " to describe the cough and excess mucus in chronic bronchitis . René Laennec , the physician who invented the stethoscope , used the term " emphysema " in his book A Treatise on the Diseases of the Chest and of Mediate <unk> ( 1837 ) to describe lungs that did not collapse when he opened the chest during an autopsy . He noted that they did not collapse as usual because they were full of air and the airways were filled with mucus . In 1842 , John Hutchinson invented the <unk> , which allowed the measurement of vital capacity of the lungs . However , his <unk> could only measure volume , not airflow . <unk> and Pinelli in 1947 described the principles of measuring airflow . 
 In 1953 , Dr. George L. <unk> , an American <unk> , first described a new disease he named " smoker 's respiratory syndrome " in the 1953 Journal of the American Medical Association . This was the first association between tobacco smoking and chronic respiratory disease . 
 Early treatments included garlic , cinnamon and ipecac , among others . Modern treatments were developed during the second half of the 20th century . Evidence supporting the use of steroids in COPD were published in the late 1950s . Bronchodilators came into use in the 1960s following a promising trial of <unk> . Further bronchodilators , such as salbutamol , were developed in the 1970s , and the use of LABAs began in the mid @-@ 1990s . 
 = = Society and culture = = 
 COPD has been referred to as " smoker 's lung " . People with emphysema have been known as " pink <unk> " or " type A " due to their frequent pink complexion , fast respiratory rate and pursed lips , and people with chronic bronchitis have been referred to as " blue <unk> " or " type B " due to the often bluish color of the skin and lips from low oxygen levels and their ankle swelling . This terminology is no longer accepted as useful as most people with COPD have a combination of both emphysema and chronic bronchitis . 
 Many health systems have difficulty ensuring appropriate identification , diagnosis and care of people with COPD ; Britain 's Department of Health has identified this as a major issue for the National Health Service and has introduced a specific strategy to tackle these problems . 
 = = = Economics = = = 
 Globally , as of 2010 , COPD is estimated to result in economic costs of $ 2 @.@ 1 trillion , half of which occurring in the developing world . Of this total an estimated $ 1 @.@ 9 trillion are direct costs such as medical care , while $ 0 @.@ 2 trillion are indirect costs such as missed work . This is expected to more than double by the year 2030 . In Europe , COPD represents 3 % of healthcare spending . In the United States , costs of the disease are estimated at $ 50 billion , most of which is due to exacerbation . COPD was among the most expensive conditions seen in U.S. hospitals in 2011 , with a total cost of about $ 5 @.@ 7 billion . 
 = = Research = = 
 <unk> , an immune @-@ suppressing antibody , has been tested in COPD but there was no evidence of benefit with the possibility of harm . <unk> shows promise in decreasing the rate of exacerbations but does not appear to change quality of life . A number of new , long @-@ acting agents are under development . 
 Treatment with stem cells is under study . While there is tentative data that it is safe and with promising animal data there is little human data as of 2014 . Some of the human data that is available has found poor results . 
 = = Other animals = = 
 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may occur in a number of other animals and may be caused by exposure to tobacco smoke . Most cases of the disease , however , are relatively mild . In horses it is known as recurrent airway obstruction , can be quite severe , and most often is linked to an allergic reaction to a fungus contained in contaminated hay or straw . COPD is also commonly found in old dogs . 
 = Trouble ( Leona Lewis song ) = 
 " Trouble " is a song recorded by British recording artist Leona Lewis and American entertainer Childish Gambino for Lewis ' third studio album , Glassheart ( 2012 ) . Inspired by Lewis ' break @-@ up with childhood sweetheart Lou Al @-@ Chamaa , " Trouble " is a mid @-@ tempo R & B and trip hop ballad , with a piano and strings @-@ driven melody . It was written by a British writing collective consisting of Lewis , Donald Glover , Hugo Chegwin , Harry Craze , Shahid Khan , James Murray , Mustafa Omer , Emeli Sandé and Fraser T Smith . Production came courtesy of Khan under his production name of Naughty Boy and Smith , along with co @-@ producer Chris Loco and additional producer Jahlil Beats . Music critics noted that the urban production marked a new direction for Lewis , particularly by featuring Gambino during the song 's middle eight breakdown with a poetic rap verse . A version excluding Gambino is also included on Glassheart . 
 " Trouble " was also influenced by British trip hop duo Massive Attack , who Lewis cited as a musical inspiration . Lewis ' falsetto and soprano vocal performance on the song garnered early praise from critics who commended the raw emotions , as well as Gambino 's guest rap and the song 's melodic <unk> and piano @-@ heavy production . " Trouble " premiered on 21 August 2012 on BBC Radio 1 's Breakfast with Scott , ahead of its release as Glassheart 's lead single , superseding the 2011 single " Collide " , a collaboration with Swedish DJ and record producer Avicii . " Trouble " was released on 5 October 2012 , preceding the album by one week , and entered the UK Singles Chart at number seven becoming Lewis 's ninth top @-@ ten single . In Ireland " Trouble " charted at number twenty @-@ one becoming Lewis 's eighth top @-@ thirty single . 
 As part of promotion of the song , fans were given chance to produce their own remix of " Trouble " which was released alongside the single on Lewis ' official music store . An accompanying music video was filmed on 22 August in Los Angeles , with Teen Wolf actor Colton Haynes cast as Lewis ' love interest . Haynes , a friend of Lewis , was chosen due to his physical resemblance to Lewis ' ex Al @-@ <unk> . In the video , Lewis and Haynes ' relationship begins to unfold and culminates in an altercation between the duo before Haynes leaves and Lewis breaks down in tears . Lewis also recorded an acoustic performance of the song for her Vevo account . " Trouble " was promoted with performances on the ninth series of The X Factor ( UK ) , on 7 October 2012 , later on Alan Carr : Chatty Man and also during a set at London nightclub , G @-@ A @-@ Y. 
 = = Background and release = = 
 Lewis began to conceptualise her third album Glassheart in the second half of 2010 , shortly after completing her first headline concert tour , The Labyrinth . " Trouble " was one of the earlier songs recorded by Lewis , and one of several tracks that Lewis worked on with British duo Emeli Sandé and Naughty Boy . Sandé first conceived the loose concepts for " Trouble " in 2009 . It was not until British hip @-@ hop artist Tinie Tempah began working with Sandé for his own debut album Disc @-@ Overy ( 2011 ) , that " Trouble " was pitched to Lewis ; Tempah approached Lewis to record " Trouble " as a duet with himself . Upon hearing the demo , Lewis asked Tempah if she could have the song and subsequently entered the recording studios with Sandé and Fraser T Smith to record and finish the song . Sandé later wrote two more songs for Lewis , including " I to You " and " Sugar " . A fourth song , " Mountains " , was reclaimed by Sandé and was recorded for her debut album Our Version of Events ( 2012 ) . 
 With a November 2011 release date set for Glassheart , Lewis proceeded with the release of the album 's first single " Collide " on 15 July 2011 . However , Swedish house music DJ Avicii sued Lewis and Sony Music , claiming that " Collide " was a reproduction of his own instrumental single " Penguin , " for which he had sought the legal permission to sample Simon Jeffes ' " <unk> Mobile " . Following a settlement out of court , " Collide " was released crediting both Lewis and Avicii . " Collide " reached number one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart , number three in Ireland and number four in the United Kingdom . Despite this , Glassheart was pushed into early 2012 to accommodate new recording sessions . During this time Lewis would work with Scottish DJ Calvin Harris and record a song called " We Found Love " . Harris wanted Lewis to release " We Found Love " at the end of 2011 , yet Lewis and her label had already decided " Trouble " would be the second single from Glassheart . During an interview with Digital Spy , Lewis said " Yes , I think ' Trouble ' will be the second single . I can 't wait for everyone to hear it . I 'm really excited about it . It 's one that I really love . " Once the album was pushed back again to mid @-@ 2012 , and then October 2012 , Harris reclaimed " We Found Love " , which was subsequently recorded by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna for her album Talk That Talk and became a number one hit worldwide . 
 Nearly a year later as work for the album neared completion , Lewis was able to confirm that " Trouble " would still be the album 's second single and was due for release in October 2012 alongside the album . Between the announcement in 2011 and the song 's release in 2012 , Sony Music Entertainment re @-@ organised operations , which resulted in the closure of J Records and all previously signed artists being absorbed into RCA Records . " Trouble " is thus Lewis ' first release in partnership with RCA Records . Sony Music made " Trouble " a global priority , making it supersede " Collide " as the album 's lead single and focussing on promoting the song in the UK first before a worldwide release . A new version of " Trouble " was recorded to feature American rapper Childish Gambino and premiered on radio on 21 August 2012 . " Trouble " was played at a press premiere for Tracey Hart from Music Week magazine , along with new songs " Come Alive " and " Un Love Me " . The song was also played for Popjustice twice , first in an early form last year in 2011 and secondly in a finished form on 16 August 2012 . The website noted that the new version of " Trouble " sounded more finished and complete with the addition of Gambino 's verse . " Trouble " premiered on BBC Radio 1 's Breakfast with Scott on 21 August 2012 , ahead of its Irish release on 5 October and UK release on 7 October 2012 . It was released 14 December 2012 in Germany . 
 = = Composition and lyrics = = 
 " Trouble " is a mid @-@ tempo R & B and trip hop song written by Lewis and collective of British songwriters , including Hugo Chegwin , Harry Craze , Shahid Khan , James Murray , Mustafa Omer , Emeli Sandé and Fraser T Smith . It is primarily an R & B and trip hop song , built around a <unk> and piano @-@ driven melody . Production was done by Khan under his production name of Naughty Boy and Smith , while secondary production was provided by Chris Loco . Orlando " Jahlil Beats " Tucker provided some additional production . A reviewer from the The Metro noted that the song had a hip hop vibe and feel to its production . " Trouble " was recorded in the key of A @-@ minor and written in time signature of common time , set at a tempo of 104 beats per minute . Sony Music executive Sonny Thakrar described Lewis and Sandé 's work together on " Trouble " as " killer chemistry , " praising Sandé 's " storytelling " abilities and Lewis ' " vocal prowess " . Thakrar , who is also involved with A & R , said that " Trouble " was a showcase of an " emotional and raw " vocal from Lewis . Vocals throughout the song are sung in Lewis ' falsetto and soprano registers , spanning a range of E4 – 5 . The tone and mood of the song is ethereal , with Lewis ' vocals taking on a " haunting " tone that is only broken during middle eight section when Childish Gambino delivers his " poetic " rap verse . " Trouble " featuring Gambino appears on Glassheart as track number thirteen , whilst a solo no @-@ rap version appears on the album as track number one . 
 In a press release , Lewis explained the meaning behind " Trouble " : " it tells the story of love going bad and becoming destructive , aspects of which we can all relate to . It ’ s a deeply emotional and poignant song that I have a real connection to . " According to the Sunday Mirror , " Trouble " was inspired by Lewis ' break @-@ up with her childhood sweetheart Lou Al @-@ Chamaa . Lyrics which reference her relationship with Chamaa include the lines : " I told you never to get used to me , I stay awake while you fall asleep . I 'm a whole lot of trouble , we 're in a whole lot of trouble . You shout louder than you used to , and you hold on tighter in the bedroom . " During an interview with Digital Spy , Lewis further explained that she was inspired and influenced by British trip @-@ hop pioneers Massive Attack . The Sun 's showbiz editor Gordan Smart also picked up on the similarities , noting that " Trouble " sounds similar to " Unfinished Sympathy " ( 1991 ) and " Teardrop " ( 1998 ) by Massive Attack . " Trouble " drew comparisons to Sandé 's own singles ; according to Michael Cragg from The Guardian , " Trouble " was much like " Heaven " ( 2011 ) while MSN 's Danielle Cheeseman compared it to Sandé collaboration with Naughty Boy , " Daddy " ( 2011 ) . 
 = = Response = = 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 " Trouble " received mainly positive reviews from critics , who praised Childish Gambino 's featured rap , the musical production and Lewis 's emotive vocals . A reviewer from Pop Justice said that the site had twice heard " Trouble " ; the first time was just before " Collide " was released in September 2011 , while a second finished version was played for them on 16 August 2012 . The final track featured the same " beguiling feel " as the earlier version but was more " finished . " The reviewer commented , " [ ' Trouble ' has ] a convincing , compelling and dramatic vocal performance which works brilliantly against the song 's opulent but bleak mid @-@ tempo production " , adding that although Childish Gambino 's " rap in the middle eight sounds great " , it almost " slightly dilutes Leona 's big comeback " . These sentiments were echoed by Kim Dawson from the Daily Star , describing the song as bringing Lewis " bang up to date " thanks to " a mid @-@ tempo melody , epic strings , sharp lyrics " and a " slammin ' rap from Gambino " . Meanwhile , Kirsten McCormack from the Daily Mail praised Lewis ' " ethereal and haunting vocal tones " make " Trouble " a " showcase [ for ] the sheer power and intimacy of Leona ’ s incredible talent " . McCormack also praised the " home @-@ grown " talent of a completely British writing camp which conceptualised the song , calling it a " standout track " and something that Lewis could be passionate about . 
 During early previews of the song , Corner spoke most on Gambino 's guest appearance , describing the collaboration as " unlikely on paper " but then in reality " it results in one of Leona 's most natural collaborations to date " . Commenting on the song as a whole , Corner said " Trouble " was a powerful comeback , " It 's big , it 's emotional and it 's what we 've come to expect from the Hackney belle – but we wouldn 't want it any other way . " Gordon Smart , showbiz editor for The Sun added that although " it was a long time coming , [ ... ] ' Trouble ' will definitely make people interested in a full album " mainly down the new sound , image and Gambino 's guest rap which will " help shake off Lewis ' safe image . " Lewis Corner from Digital Spy also picked up on the change of direction and commented that people would be " shocked , " but then added that " when " it results in an emotive anthem like this , we hope she unleashes it more often . " The Guardian 's Michael Cragg called " Trouble " a return to the " safer " templates of her first two albums , but praised the song 's production calling it " a vaguely trip @-@ hop beat buffeted by soaring strings and a troubled lyric in the chorus . " Like previous reviews , Cragg also praised Gambino stating that he " manages to stamp his own personality on the song " despite appearing near the end of the song and that perhaps it was Lewis ' best chance at " regaining her footing in America " . 
 In a later review , Corner said that " Trouble " was built around " echoing beats and heart @-@ tugging piano riff , " which when combined with " her unmistakable falsetto " was as dramatic as a scene from the film The Hunger Games . Elena Gorgon from Softpedia echoed earlier sentiments , concluding that the song " was powerful , it 's heartfelt and it confirms Leona as one of the most remarkable vocalists of the day . " However MSN 's Danielle Cheeseman said that " Trouble " being a safe return to what Lewis has always done wasn 't necessarily a good thing . In her review , Cheeseman called the song the " same melodrama " as past Lewis songs and that due to the song sounding familiar to Sandé 's song " Daddy " , " Lewis has yet to find her own stride " . Corner featured " Trouble " on his weekly playlist " 10 Songs You Need to Hear " for the week beginning 27 August 2012 . There he described elaborated that the song was a welcome return for Lewis thanks to " big beats , big strings and even bigger vocals " . Whilst the majority of reviews praised Gambino 's appearance on the song , Cheeseman described the collaboration as " a saviour " but that it did nothing for Lewis ' " credibility " . Her review was subtitled " Leona Lewis Tries to <unk> Us She 's ' Trouble ' — We 're not <unk> ' what she 's <unk> ' " and concluded that if the best that Glassheart could preview after all the delays was " Trouble " , " it won 't be worth the wait . " NME 's Jeremy Allen agreed , praising the production on " Trouble " as " slick " but stating that from Lewis it does not come across with conviction nor is it believable .

Haynes said that his and Lewis ' managers were good friends and thus the casting was arranged through them . Described by Capital FM as " Lewis enduring an awkward break @-@ up " interpolated with " time [ s ] when the couple were happy and in love , " the music video for " Trouble " uses the solo version of the song , which excludes Childish Gambino 's rap verse . It was filmed in Los Angeles and sees the relationship between Haynes and Lewis unfold in various scenarios , particularly focussing on how the couple argue before walking away from each other . 
 <unk> by Raul B. Fernandez , the principle filming of the video took place in just one day . While filming the bedroom scene for the video , Lewis fell from the bed and injured her toe . A doctor was called on set to examine the injury , but Lewis was given the all clear and resumed filming barefoot for the rest of the video . On 29 August 2012 , the official lyrics video was uploaded to Lewis ' YouTube page . Two weeks later , Lewis uploaded some still images from the music video . On 14 September 2012 , Lewis uploaded the official music video for " Trouble " to her VEVO account . Behind @-@ the @-@ scenes footage from the video shoot was released on 4 October 2012 , and shows Lewis and Haynes filming each of the scenes with commentary from Fernandez , Haynes and Lewis .

 The video begins with a view of the apartment that Lewis and Haynes shared . Books and a vase lay strewn across the floor , while Lewis weeps in the corner and Haynes watches from a distance teary @-@ eyed . The video switches to several other shots of Lewis singing the first verse , looking morose . In a third shot , Lewis is seen standing on a rooftop against the Los Angeles skyline dressed in a dark red crop top . Then the video switches to Lewis standing in front of projected images of the memorable times of her relationship with Haynes . Lewis and Haynes are seen sat at opposite ends of the sofa looking into the distance , spliced with more scenes of Lewis on the rooftop . The couple are seen during an awkward dinner before switching to images of the couple in bed together , seemingly happy . As the chorus kicks in for the first time , the couple are seen arriving at a party , with Lewis wearing an aqua @-@ coloured dress with a portion of her midriff revealed , meanwhile Haynes wears a plaid shirt and jeans . Initially the couple are content , embracing guests but socialising separately and avoiding contact with each other . The camera switches between these and the earlier scenes of Lewis in front of projected images and the LA skyline throughout the chorus . As Lewis sings " I 'm a whole lot of trouble / We 're in a whole lot of trouble " , she glances over to see Haynes flirting with another girl . 
 In the following verse , Lewis and Haynes are seen having several embraces , some joyful while others are more tense as Lewis is sad . The couple are then seen leaving the party ; Haynes walks over to Lewis and attempts to kiss , but she proceeds to push him away . During the second airing of the chorus , more images of happy scenes between the couple are spliced with Lewis waking up in bed to find Haynes has slept on the sofa . More passionate embraces between the couple are seen before Lewis is seen breaking down in tears . At the breakfast that follows , the couple break into a series of arguments . Lewis shoves Haynes onto the sofa , and Haynes grabs Lewis as she turns away . Lewis then slaps Hayne around the face . During the middle eight breakdown in the song , Haynes throws books from a shelf , and Lewis throws objects at Haynes including a cushion , as well as pushing over a lamp . Haynes subsequently leaves , driving away into the distance , and Lewis falls to the wall and breaks down in tears .

It is one of five such acoustic performances that Lewis recorded of songs from Glassheart in August 2012 . Deekay from soul music website <unk> praised the acoustic performance , saying that while the original version " just about added up to the sum of its individually brilliant parts " , the acoustic " [ is ] perhaps even better than the original " .

 = No. 482 Squadron RAAF = 
 No. 482 Squadron was a maintenance unit of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . It was formed in May 1942 as No. 4 Repair and Salvage Unit , renamed No. 4 Repair and Servicing Unit in January 1945 and re @-@ formed as No. 482 ( Maintenance ) Squadron in May 1946 . The squadron then became a component of No. 82 ( Bomber ) Wing at RAAF Station Amberley , Queensland . Over the years it serviced the wing 's Consolidated B @-@ 24 Liberators , Avro Lincolns , English Electric Canberras , McDonnell Douglas F @-@ 4E Phantoms , and General Dynamics F @-@ 111Cs . No. 482 Squadron merged with No. 3 Aircraft Depot to form No. 501 Wing in March 1992 . No. 501 Wing continued to provide maintenance and logistics support for the F @-@ 111Cs at Amberley until disbanding in 2001 .

 No. 4 Repair and Salvage Unit ( RSU ) was formed at RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria , on 18 May 1942 . Its inaugural commanding officer , from 1 June , was acting Flight Lieutenant <unk> Relf . On 20 October , it commenced a move to Pell Airfield , Northern Territory , becoming operational on 26 December . Coming under the control of North @-@ Western Area Command ( NWA ) , No. 4 RSU was responsible for salvaging damaged aircraft , which it subsequently repaired or dismantled for spare parts . By December 1943 , its strength was over 500 officers and men . It was renamed No. 4 Repair and Servicing Unit on 1 January 1945 , and re @-@ located to Winnellie , Northern Territory , on 11 May . As the war in the Pacific moved northward , No. 4 RSU 's strength was reduced ; by August it was under 400 , including 11 officers . On 15 December 1945 , it moved to RAAF Station Parkes , New South Wales . The unit re @-@ located from Parkes to RAAF Station Amberley , Queensland , on 15 April 1946 . 
 No. 4 RSU re @-@ formed as No. 482 ( Maintenance ) Squadron on 10 May 1946 . Commanded by Squadron Leader J.E. Jackson , it became a component of No. 82 ( Bomber ) Wing . The squadron 's motto was " <unk> " . No. 82 Wing 's flying complement included Nos. 12 , 21 , and 23 Squadrons , but these were renumbered Nos. 1 , 2 and 6 Squadrons respectively in February 1948 . At the same time , the wing 's Consolidated B @-@ 24 Liberator heavy bombers were replaced by Avro Lincolns . During 1949 – 50 , some of the Lincolns were specially modified with advanced radar and other instrumentation to participate in Operation Cumulative , a joint program with the Royal Air Force gathering long @-@ range navigation and bombing data for use in potential air campaigns against the Soviet Union . No. 482 Squadron faced a critical shortage of Merlin engines in mid @-@ 1950 , but the situation improved the next year . 
 In October 1950 , No. 482 Squadron personnel undertook airframe and Avon engine courses in preparation for the introduction of the recently ordered English Electric Canberra jet bomber , forty @-@ eight of which began re @-@ equipping No. 82 Wing 's flying squadrons in December 1953 . During the 1950s and 60s , No. 482 Squadron provided ground support for exercises involving the Canberras in Darwin and New Guinea , and for ceremonial occasions including several royal visits . In April 1968 , No. 1 Operational Conversion Unit ( OCU ) , responsible for converting aircrew to the Canberra , was made independent of No. 82 Wing to concentrate on providing crews for No. 2 Squadron , which was on active duty in the Vietnam War . Maintenance responsibilities for the Canberras then transferred from No. 482 Squadron to No. 1 OCU , along with relevant staff and equipment . 
 Between 1970 and 1973 , as an interim measure pending the long @-@ delayed delivery of the General Dynamics F @-@ 111C swing @-@ wing bomber , No. 82 Wing operated leased McDonnell Douglas F @-@ 4E Phantoms . They were maintained by No. 482 Squadron in conjunction with No. 3 Aircraft Depot ; as well as routine servicing , the units modified the Phantoms ' AN / APQ @-@ 120 radars during early 1971 . No. 482 Squadron 's hangar , electronics , and training facilities had been upgraded in the late 1960s in anticipation of the arrival of the F @-@ 111 ; the unit 's main hangar became known as the " Taj Mahal " . By 1973 , the year the F @-@ 111 finally entered service , No. 482 Squadron had a strength of over 700 . Borrowing a concept from the United States Air Force , the RAAF employed a centralised servicing regime , whereby all aircraft and maintenance personnel were held by No. 482 Squadron , which serviced and released the F @-@ 111s in line with Nos. 1 and 6 Squadrons ' joint flying program . According to Air Marshal Errol McCormack , an F @-@ 111 pilot who rose to become Chief of the Air Staff , the system was a " disaster " that was doomed to failure owing to the relatively small size of the RAAF 's F @-@ 111 fleet . 
 Responsibility for operational @-@ level servicing of the F @-@ 111s was transferred to the flying squadrons on 1 February 1981 . Under this arrangement , 200 personnel moved from No. 482 Squadron to Nos. 1 and 6 Squadrons , which for the first time took direct control of their F @-@ 111s . No. 482 Squadron continued to provide intermediate @-@ level servicing for the bombers , while major upgrades and complex maintenance involving stripping down the airframe and engines were carried out by No. 3 Aircraft Depot . No. 482 Squadron also operated the F @-@ 111 flight simulator . The squadron 's personnel deployed with the F @-@ 111s on exercises , and took part in investigations and recovery operations following accidents . On 17 March 1983 , Sir Ninian Stephen presented No. 482 Squadron with the Governor @-@ General 's Banner . No. 482 Squadron merged with No. 3 Aircraft Depot to form No. 501 Wing on 16 March 1992 . It became the largest unit in the RAAF , with a total strength of over 1 @,@ 200 . No. 501 Wing continued to provide deep maintenance and logistics support for the F @-@ 111s at Amberley until 2001 , when Boeing Australia was awarded the maintenance contract . 
 = Lou Rymkus = 
 Louis Joseph " the Battler " Rymkus ( November 6 , 1919 – October 31 , 1998 ) was an American football player and coach in the All @-@ America Football Conference ( AAFC ) , National Football League ( NFL ) and American Football League ( AFL ) . Playing as a tackle for the Cleveland Browns in the AAFC and NFL in the late 1940s and early 1950s , Rymkus provided pass protection for quarterback Otto Graham as the team won five league championships . Following his playing career , Rymkus took a number of assistant coaching jobs before serving as the first head coach of the AFL 's Houston Oilers in 1960 . The team won the league 's first championship , but Rymkus was fired by Oilers owner Bud Adams after a slow start in 1961 . 
 Rymkus was born in Royalton , Illinois and grew up in Chicago . He was a star lineman in high school and won a football scholarship to attend the University of Notre Dame . At Notre Dame , he played on a 1941 team that went undefeated under head coach Frank Leahy . Rymkus was drafted by the NFL 's Washington Redskins in 1943 and played one season for the team before joining the U.S. Marines during World War II . Following two years in the service , he signed with the Browns , where he spent the remainder of his playing career . Paul Brown , the Browns ' first coach , called Rymkus " the best pass protector I 've ever seen " . His blocking was used by coaches to demonstrate proper form . 
 After Rymkus 's brief stint coaching the Oilers , he held numerous football jobs , including as the coach of a high school team in Louisiana and an assistant with the Detroit Lions . Rymkus was a finalist for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1988 but was not elected . In 2005 , he was named to the Professional Football Researchers Association Hall of Very Good in the association 's third HOVG class . 
 He died of a stroke in Houston , Texas , where he lived for most of his later life . 
 = = Early life and high school career = = 
 Rymkus was born in Royalton , Illinois , the son of a Lithuanian immigrant coal miner who owned a small grocery store . After his father was shot and killed outside the grocery store , Rymkus and his family moved to the Back of the Yards neighborhood on Chicago 's South Side . With family finances tight , he took a number of odd jobs , including working as a laborer and delivering newspapers and groceries . At the suggestion of a friend , Rymkus attended Tilden Tech , now known as Tilden High School , and began to display talent as a lineman on the school 's football team . He blocked a kick and scored a touchdown in a game at Chicago 's Soldier Field in 1936 against rival Austin High , a play he later said was the most memorable of his high school career . Rymkus won seven letters at Tilden playing on the football , track and wrestling teams . As a senior , he defeated Rudy Mucha to win the Chicago prep @-@ school wrestling title . 
 = = College and professional career = = 
 Rymkus 's success in high school led to a scholarship to the University of Notre Dame , where he played from 1940 to 1942 . He was known in college as a tough and durable tackle . In a 1941 game against Georgia Tech , Rymkus was elbowed in his upper lip . He left the game to get 14 stitches and returned to play in the 20 – 0 Notre Dame victory . Notre Dame went undefeated that season , coach Frank Leahy 's first year at the school . During his junior year in 1942 , Rymkus earned All @-@ America honors , and in his final season at Notre Dame he was named the team 's Most Valuable Player . 
 Rymkus was drafted by the National Football League 's Washington Redskins in 1943 , signing a contract giving him a $ 2 @,@ 000 annual salary ( $ 27 @,@ 350 in 2016 dollars ) . Playing alongside quarterback Sammy Baugh , Rymkus returned a blocked punt for a touchdown in one game and an interception for a touchdown in the next game . After the 1943 season , Rymkus joined the U.S. Marines during World War II . He trained Navy recruits at Great Lakes Naval Station near Chicago in 1944 and 1945 , and served at Pearl Harbor . 
 As the war wound down with Germany 's surrender in mid @-@ 1945 , Rymkus decided to join the new Cleveland Browns of the fledgling All @-@ America Football Conference . Paul Brown , the coach of the new team , had met Rymkus at Great Lakes , where he coached the training station 's military football squad . Brown offered Rymkus a $ 4 @,@ 000 salary ( $ 52 @,@ 577 today ) , double what he made with the Redskins . George Preston Marshall , the owner of the Redskins , declined to match the offer and questioned the wisdom of joining a league that he thought had little chance of success competing against the more established NFL . Rymkus left his wife Betty in <unk> , Indiana and hitchhiked to the Browns ' training camp in Bowling Green , Ohio . 
 The Browns began play in 1946 , and Rymkus soon became an anchor of the team 's offensive and defensive lines . He solidified his reputation for toughness by playing more than 50 minutes per game that year despite a knee injury for which he needed surgery immediately after the season . On defense , Rymkus helped stop opponents ' rushing attacks and disrupt the opposing quarterback . On offense , he helped protect quarterback Otto Graham and opened up running room for fullback Marion Motley . Graham led the AAFC in total passing yards over its four years of existence , while Motley led the league in rushing .
