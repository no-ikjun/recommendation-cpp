 Renewable energy commercialization involves the deployment of three generations of renewable energy technologies dating back more than 100 years . First @-@ generation technologies , which are already mature and economically competitive , include biomass , hydroelectricity , geothermal power and heat . Second @-@ generation technologies are market @-@ ready and are being deployed at the present time ; they include solar heating , photovoltaics , wind power , solar thermal power stations , and modern forms of bioenergy . Third @-@ generation technologies require continued R & D efforts in order to make large contributions on a global scale and include advanced biomass gasification , hot @-@ dry @-@ rock geothermal power , and ocean energy . As of 2012 , renewable energy accounts for about half of new nameplate electrical capacity installed and costs are continuing to fall . 
 Public policy and political leadership helps to " level the playing field " and drive the wider acceptance of renewable energy technologies . Countries such as Germany , Denmark , and Spain have led the way in implementing innovative policies which has driven most of the growth over the past decade . As of 2014 , Germany has a commitment to the " Energiewende " transition to a sustainable energy economy , and Denmark has a commitment to 100 % renewable energy by 2050 . There are now 144 countries with renewable energy policy targets . 
 Renewable energy continued its rapid growth in 2015 , providing multiple benefits . There was a new record set for installed wind and photovoltaic capacity ( <unk> and <unk> ) and a new high of US $ 329 Billion for global renewables investment . A key benefit that this investment growth brings is a growth in jobs . The top countries for investment in recent years were China , Germany , Spain , the United States , Italy , and Brazil . Renewable energy companies include BrightSource Energy , First Solar , <unk> , GE Energy , <unk> , Sinovel , Trina Solar , Vestas , and Yingli . 
 Climate change concerns are also driving increasing growth in the renewable energy industries . According to a 2011 projection by the ( IEA ) International Energy Agency , solar power generators may produce most of the world 's electricity within 50 years , reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions . 
 = = Overview = = 
 = = = Rationale for renewables = = = 
 Climate change , pollution , and energy insecurity are significant problems , and addressing them requires major changes to energy infrastructures . Renewable energy technologies are essential contributors to the energy supply portfolio , as they contribute to world energy security , reduce dependency on fossil fuels , and provide opportunities for mitigating greenhouse gases . Climate @-@ disrupting fossil fuels are being replaced by clean , climate @-@ stabilizing , non @-@ <unk> sources of energy : 
 ... the transition from coal , oil , and gas to wind , solar , and geothermal energy is well under way . In the old economy , energy was produced by burning something — oil , coal , or natural gas — leading to the carbon emissions that have come to define our economy . The new energy economy harnesses the energy in wind , the energy coming from the sun , and heat from within the earth itself . 
 In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for a variety of methods for addressing the problem of energy supply . These methods include promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power , requiring utilities to use more renewable energy , and providing tax incentives to encourage the development and use of such technologies . It is expected that renewable energy investments will pay off economically in the long term . 
 EU member countries have shown support for ambitious renewable energy goals . In 2010 , Eurobarometer polled the twenty @-@ seven EU member states about the target " to increase the share of renewable energy in the EU by 20 percent by 2020 " . Most people in all twenty @-@ seven countries either approved of the target or called for it to go further . Across the EU , 57 percent thought the proposed goal was " about right " and 16 percent thought it was " too modest . " In comparison , 19 percent said it was " too ambitious " . 
 As of 2011 , new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources , and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies is needed : 
 Several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain . New EPA initiatives targeting air toxics , coal ash , and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies . The use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny , with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions . Concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal @-@ fired and nuclear power plants , particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages . Events at the Fukushima nuclear plant have renewed doubts about the ability to operate large numbers of nuclear plants safely over the long term . Further , cost estimates for " next generation " nuclear units continue to climb , and lenders are unwilling to finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees . 
 The 2014 REN21 Global Status Report says that renewable energies are no longer just energy sources , but ways to address pressing social , political , economic and environmental problems : 
 Today , renewables are seen not only as sources of energy , but also as tools to address many other pressing needs , including : improving energy security ; reducing the health and environmental impacts associated with fossil and nuclear energy ; mitigating greenhouse gas emissions ; improving educational opportunities ; creating jobs ; reducing poverty ; and increasing gender equality ... Renewables have entered the mainstream . 
 = = = Growth of renewables = = = 
 In 2008 for the first time , more renewable energy than conventional power capacity was added in both the European Union and United States , demonstrating a " fundamental transition " of the world 's energy markets towards renewables , according to a report released by REN21 , a global renewable energy policy network based in Paris . In 2010 , renewable power consisted about a third of the newly built power generation capacities . 
 By the end of 2011 , total renewable power capacity worldwide exceeded 1 @,@ 360 GW , up 8 % . Renewables producing electricity accounted for almost half of the 208 GW of capacity added globally during 2011 . Wind and solar photovoltaics ( PV ) accounted for almost 40 % and 30 % . Based on REN21 's 2014 report , renewables contributed 19 percent to our energy consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013 , respectively . This energy consumption is divided as 9 % coming from traditional biomass , 4 @.@ 2 % as heat energy ( non @-@ biomass ) , 3 @.@ 8 % hydro electricity and 2 % electricity from wind , solar , geothermal , and biomass . 
 During the five @-@ years from the end of 2004 through 2009 , worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10 – 60 percent annually for many technologies . In 2011 , UN under @-@ secretary general Achim Steiner said : " The continuing growth in this core segment of the green economy is not happening by chance . The combination of government target @-@ setting , policy support and stimulus funds is underpinning the renewable industry 's rise and bringing the much needed transformation of our global energy system within reach . " He added : " Renewable energies are expanding both in terms of investment , projects and geographical spread . In doing so , they are making an increasing contribution to combating climate change , countering energy poverty and energy insecurity " . 
 According to a 2011 projection by the International Energy Agency , solar power plants may produce most of the world 's electricity within 50 years , significantly reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment . The IEA has said : " Photovoltaic and solar @-@ thermal plants may meet most of the world 's demand for electricity by 2060 – and half of all energy needs – with wind , hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation " . " Photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity " . 
 In 2013 , China led the world in renewable energy production , with a total capacity of 378 GW , mainly from hydroelectric and wind power . As of 2014 , China leads the world in the production and use of wind power , solar photovoltaic power and smart grid technologies , generating almost as much water , wind and solar energy as all of France and Germany 's power plants combined . China 's renewable energy sector is growing faster than its fossil fuels and nuclear power capacity . Since 2005 , production of solar cells in China has expanded 100 @-@ fold . As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown , the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped . Innovation has helped , but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion . 
 See also renewable energy in the United States for US @-@ figures . 
 = = = Economic trends = = = 
 Renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper , through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition . A 2011 IEA report said : " A portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost @-@ competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances , in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support , " and added that " cost reductions in critical technologies , such as wind and solar , are set to continue . " As of 2011 , there have been substantial reductions in the cost of solar and wind technologies : 
 The price of PV modules per MW has fallen by 60 percent since the summer of 2008 , according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates , putting solar power for the first time on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in a number of sunny countries . Wind turbine prices have also fallen – by 18 percent per MW in the last two years – reflecting , as with solar , fierce competition in the supply chain . Further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar , wind and other technologies lie ahead , posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years . 
 Hydro @-@ electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity . Renewable energy costs continue to drop , and the levelised cost of electricity ( LCOE ) is declining for wind power , solar photovoltaic ( PV ) , concentrated solar power ( CSP ) and some biomass technologies . 
 Renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid @-@ connected capacity in areas with good resources . As the cost of renewable power falls , the scope of economically viable applications increases . Renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity . Where " oil @-@ fired generation is the predominant power generation source ( e.g. on islands , off @-@ grid and in some countries ) a lower @-@ cost renewable solution almost always exists today " . As of 2012 , renewable power generation technologies accounted for around half of all new power generation capacity additions globally . In 2011 , additions included 41 gigawatt ( GW ) of new wind power capacity , 30 GW of PV , 25 GW of hydro @-@ electricity , 6 GW of biomass , 0 @.@ 5 GW of CSP , and 0 @.@ 1 GW of geothermal power . 
 = = = Three generations of technologies = = = 
 Renewable energy includes a number of sources and technologies at different stages of commercialization . The International Energy Agency ( IEA ) has defined three generations of renewable energy technologies , reaching back over 100 years : 
 " First @-@ generation technologies emerged from the industrial revolution at the end of the 19th century and include hydropower , biomass combustion , geothermal power and heat . These technologies are quite widely used . 
 Second @-@ generation technologies include solar heating and cooling , wind power , modern forms of bioenergy , and solar photovoltaics . These are now entering markets as a result of research , development and demonstration ( RD & D ) investments since the 1980s . Initial investment was prompted by energy security concerns linked to the oil crises of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due , at least in part , to environmental benefits . Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials . 
 Third @-@ generation technologies are still under development and include advanced biomass gasification , <unk> technologies , concentrating solar thermal power , hot @-@ dry @-@ rock geothermal power , and ocean energy . Advances in nanotechnology may also play a major role " . First @-@ generation technologies are well established , second @-@ generation technologies are entering markets , and third @-@ generation technologies heavily depend on long @-@ term research and development commitments , where the public sector has a role to play . 
 = = First @-@ generation technologies = = 
 First @-@ generation technologies are widely used in locations with abundant resources . Their future use depends on the exploration of the remaining resource potential , particularly in developing countries , and on overcoming challenges related to the environment and social acceptance . 
 = = = Biomass = = = 
 Biomass for heat and power is a fully mature technology which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal , agricultural , and industrial organic wastes . However , the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007 , even though demand for biomass ( mostly wood ) continues to grow in many developing countries . One of the problems of biomass is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants , leading to severe health and environmental consequences , although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects . First @-@ generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive , but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small @-@ scale issues . 
 = = = Hydroelectricity = = = 
 Hydroelectricity is the term referring to electricity generated by hydropower ; the production of electrical power through the use of the gravitational force of falling or flowing water . In 2015 hydropower generated 16 @.@ 6 % of the worlds total electricity and 70 % of all renewable electricity and is expected to increase about 3 @.@ 1 % each year for the next 25 years . Hydroelectric plants have the advantage of being long @-@ lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years . 
 Hydropower is produced in 150 countries , with the Asia @-@ Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010 . China is the largest hydroelectricity producer , with 721 terawatt @-@ hours of production in 2010 , representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use . There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW : the Three Gorges Dam in China , Itaipu Dam across the Brazil / Paraguay border , and Guri Dam in Venezuela . The cost of hydroelectricity is low , making it a competitive source of renewable electricity . The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt @-@ hour . 
 = = = Geothermal power and heat = = = 
 Geothermal power plants can operate 24 hours per day , providing baseload capacity . Estimates for the world potential capacity for geothermal power generation vary widely , ranging from 40 GW by 2020 to as much as 6 @,@ 000 GW . 
 Geothermal power capacity grew from around 1 GW in 1975 to almost 10 GW in 2008 . The United States is the world leader in terms of installed capacity , representing 3 @.@ 1 GW . Other countries with significant installed capacity include the Philippines ( 1 @.@ 9 GW ) , Indonesia ( 1 @.@ 2 GW ) , Mexico ( 1 @.@ 0 GW ) , Italy ( 0 @.@ 8 GW ) , Iceland ( 0 @.@ 6 GW ) , Japan ( 0 @.@ 5 GW ) , and New Zealand ( 0 @.@ 5 GW ) . In some countries , geothermal power accounts for a significant share of the total electricity supply , such as in the Philippines , where geothermal represented 17 percent of the total power mix at the end of 2008 . 
 Geothermal ( ground source ) heat pumps represented an estimated 30 GWth of installed capacity at the end of 2008 , with other direct uses of geothermal heat ( i.e. , for space heating , agricultural drying and other uses ) reaching an estimated 15 GWth . As of 2008 , at least 76 countries use direct geothermal energy in some form . 
 = = Second @-@ generation technologies = = 
 Markets for second @-@ generation technologies have been strong and growing over the past decade , and these technologies have gone from being a passion for the dedicated few to a major economic sector in countries such as Germany , Spain , the United States , and Japan . Many large industrial companies and financial institutions are involved and the challenge is to broaden the market base for continued growth worldwide . 
 = = = Solar Heating = = = 
 Solar heating systems are a well known second @-@ generation technology and generally consist of solar thermal collectors , a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage , and a reservoir or tank for heat storage . The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water , swimming pools , or homes and businesses . The heat can also be used for industrial process applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment . 
 In many warmer climates , a solar heating system can provide a very high percentage ( 50 to 75 % ) of domestic hot water energy . As of 2009 , China has 27 million rooftop solar water heaters . 
 = = = Photovoltaics = = = 
 Photovoltaic ( PV ) cells , also called solar cells , convert light into electricity . In the 1980s and early 1990s , most photovoltaic modules were used to provide remote @-@ area power supply , but from around 1995 , industry efforts have focused increasingly on developing building integrated photovoltaics and photovoltaic power stations for grid connected applications . 
 Many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built , mainly in Europe . As of July 2012 , the largest photovoltaic ( PV ) power plants in the world are the Agua Caliente Solar Project ( USA , 247 MW ) , Charanka Solar Park ( India , 214 MW ) , <unk> Solar Park ( China , 200 MW ) , <unk> Solar Park ( Russia 100 MW ) , Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant ( Canada , 97 MW ) , Brandenburg @-@ Briest Solarpark ( Germany 91 MW ) , Solarpark <unk> Tower ( Germany 84 @.@ 7 MW ) , Montalto di Castro Photovoltaic Power Station ( Italy , 84 @.@ 2 MW ) , Eggebek Solar Park ( Germany 83 @.@ 6 MW ) , <unk> Solarpark ( Germany 82 MW ) , <unk> Solar Park ( Germany , 80 @.@ 7 MW ) , <unk> Solar Park ( Russia , 80 MW ) , <unk> Solar Farm ( Thailand 73 @.@ 16 MW ) , Rovigo Photovoltaic Power Plant ( Italy , 72 MW ) , and the <unk> Photovoltaic Park ( Germany , 71 @.@ 8 MW ) . 
 There are also many large plants under construction . The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm under construction in Riverside County , California and Topaz Solar Farm being built in San Luis Obispo County , California are both 550 MW solar parks that will use thin @-@ film solar photovoltaic modules made by First Solar . The Blythe Solar Power Project is a 500 MW photovoltaic station under construction in Riverside County , California . The California Valley Solar Ranch ( <unk> ) is a 250 megawatt ( MW ) solar photovoltaic power plant , which is being built by SunPower in the Carrizo Plain , northeast of California Valley . The 230 MW Antelope Valley Solar Ranch is a First Solar photovoltaic project which is under construction in the Antelope Valley area of the Western Mojave Desert , and due to be completed in 2013 . The Mesquite Solar project is a photovoltaic solar power plant being built in Arlington , Maricopa County , Arizona , owned by Sempra Generation . Phase 1 will have a nameplate capacity of 150 megawatts . 
 Many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use innovative tracking systems that follow the sun 's daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed @-@ mounted systems . There are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations . 
 = = = Wind power = = = 
 Some of the second @-@ generation renewables , such as wind power , have high potential and have already realised relatively low production costs . Global wind power installations increased by 35 @,@ 800 MW in 2010 , bringing total installed capacity up to 194 @,@ 400 MW , a 22 @.@ 5 % increase on the 158 @,@ 700 MW installed at the end of 2009 . The increase for 2010 represents investments totalling € 47 @.@ 3 billion ( US $ 65 billion ) and for the first time more than half of all new wind power was added outside of the traditional markets of Europe and North America , mainly driven , by the continuing boom in China which accounted for nearly half of all of the installations at 16 @,@ 500 MW . China now has 42 @,@ 300 MW of wind power installed . Wind power accounts for approximately 19 % of electricity generated in Denmark , 9 % in Spain and Portugal , and 6 % in Germany and the Republic of Ireland . In Australian state of South Australia wind power , championed by Premier Mike Rann ( 2002 – 2011 ) , now comprises 26 % of the state 's electricity generation , edging out coal fired power . At the end of 2011 South Australia , with 7 @.@ 2 % of Australia 's population , had 54 % of the nation 's installed wind power capacity . Wind power 's share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3 @.@ 1 % . These are some of the largest wind farms in the world : 
 As of 2014 , the wind industry in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades , capturing the faster winds at higher elevations . This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana , Michigan , and Ohio , the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal . Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt @-@ hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio , saying it is their cheapest option . 
 = = = Solar thermal power stations = = = 
 Solar thermal power stations include the 354 megawatt ( MW ) Solar Energy Generating Systems power plant in the USA , Solnova Solar Power Station ( Spain , 150 MW ) , Andasol solar power station ( Spain , 100 MW ) , Nevada Solar One ( USA , 64 MW ) , <unk> solar power tower ( Spain , 20 MW ) , and the <unk> solar power tower ( Spain , 11 MW ) . The 370 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility , located in California 's Mojave Desert , is the world 's largest solar @-@ thermal power plant project currently under construction . Many other plants are under construction or planned , mainly in Spain and the USA . In developing countries , three World Bank projects for integrated solar thermal / combined @-@ cycle gas @-@ turbine power plants in Egypt , Mexico , and Morocco have been approved . 
 = = = Modern forms of Bioenergy = = = 
 Global ethanol production for transport fuel tripled between 2000 and 2007 from 17 billion to more than 52 billion litres , while biodiesel expanded more than tenfold from less than 1 billion to almost 11 billion litres . Biofuels provide 1 @.@ 8 % of the world 's transport fuel and recent estimates indicate a continued high growth . The main producing countries for transport biofuels are the USA , Brazil , and the EU . 
 Brazil has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world , involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane , and ethanol now provides 18 percent of the country 's automotive fuel . As a result of this and the exploitation of domestic deep water oil sources , Brazil , which for years had to import a large share of the petroleum needed for domestic consumption , recently reached complete self @-@ sufficiency in liquid fuels . 
 Nearly all the gasoline sold in the United States today is mixed with 10 percent ethanol , a mix known as E10 , and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends . Ford , DaimlerChrysler , and GM are among the automobile companies that sell flexible @-@ fuel cars , trucks , and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85 % ethanol ( E85 ) . The challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date . The Energy Policy Act of 2005 , which calls for 7 @.@ 5 billion US gallons ( 28 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) of biofuels to be used annually by 2012 , will also help to expand the market . 
 The growing ethanol and biodiesel industries are providing jobs in plant construction , operations , and maintenance , mostly in rural communities . According to the Renewable Fuels Association , " the ethanol industry created almost 154 @,@ 000 U.S. jobs in 2005 alone , boosting household income by $ 5 @.@ 7 billion . It also contributed about $ 3 @.@ 5 billion in tax revenues at the local , state , and federal levels " .

 Third @-@ generation renewable energy technologies are still under development and include advanced biomass gasification , <unk> technologies , hot @-@ dry @-@ rock geothermal power , and ocean energy . Third @-@ generation technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization . Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies , but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research and development funding . 
 = = = New bioenergy technologies = = = 
 According to the International Energy Agency , cellulosic ethanol <unk> could allow biofuels to play a much bigger role in the future than organizations such as the IEA previously thought . <unk> ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants . Crop residues ( such as corn stalks , wheat straw and rice straw ) , wood waste , and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass . Dedicated energy crops , such as switchgrass , are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions . 
 = = = Ocean energy = = = 
 Ocean energy is all forms of renewable energy derived from the sea including wave energy , tidal energy , river current , ocean current energy , offshore wind , salinity gradient energy and ocean thermal gradient energy . 
 The Rance Tidal Power Station ( 240 MW ) is the world 's first tidal power station . The facility is located on the estuary of the Rance River , in Brittany , France . Opened on 26 November 1966 , it is currently operated by Électricité de France , and is the largest tidal power station in the world , in terms of installed capacity . 
 First proposed more than thirty years ago , systems to harvest utility @-@ scale electrical power from ocean waves have recently been gaining momentum as a viable technology . The potential for this technology is considered promising , especially on west @-@ facing coasts with latitudes between 40 and 60 degrees : 
 In the United Kingdom , for example , the Carbon Trust recently estimated the extent of the economically viable offshore resource at 55 TWh per year , about 14 % of current national demand . Across Europe , the technologically achievable resource has been estimated to be at least 280 TWh per year . In 2003 , the U.S. Electric Power Research Institute ( <unk> ) estimated the viable resource in the United States at 255 TWh per year ( 6 % of demand ) . 
 There are currently nine projects , completed or in @-@ development , off the coasts of the United Kingdom , United States , Spain and Australia to harness the rise and fall of waves by Ocean Power Technologies . The current maximum power output is 1 @.@ 5 MW ( <unk> , Oregon ) , with development underway for 100 MW ( Coos Bay , Oregon ) . 
 = = = Enhanced geothermal systems = = = 
 As of 2008 , geothermal power development was under way in more than 40 countries , partially attributable to the development of new technologies , such as Enhanced Geothermal Systems . The development of binary cycle power plants and improvements in drilling and extraction technology may enable enhanced geothermal systems over a much greater geographical range than " traditional " Geothermal systems . Demonstration EGS projects are operational in the USA , Australia , Germany , France , and The United Kingdom . 
 = = Renewable energy industry = = 
 Total investment in renewable energy reached $ 211 billion in 2010 , up from $ 160 billion in 2009 . The top countries for investment in 2010 were China , Germany , the United States , Italy , and Brazil . Continued growth for the renewable energy sector is expected and promotional policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors . 
 = = = Wind power companies = = = 
 As of 2010 , Vestas ( from Denmark ) is the world 's top wind turbine manufacturer in terms of percentage of market volume , and Sinovel ( from China ) is in second place . Together Vestas and Sinovel delivered 10 @,@ 228 MW of new wind power capacity in 2010 , and their market share was 25 @.@ 9 percent . GE Energy ( USA ) was in third place , closely followed by <unk> , another Chinese supplier . German <unk> ranks fifth in the world , and is followed in sixth place by Indian @-@ based Suzlon . 
 = = = Photovoltaic market trends = = = 
 The solar PV market has been growing for the past few years . According to solar PV research company , <unk> , worldwide shipment of solar modules in 2011 was around 25 GW , and the shipment year over year growth was around 40 % . The top 5 solar module players in 2011 in turns are <unk> , First Solar , Yingli , Trina , and <unk> . The top 5 solar module companies possessed 51 @.@ 3 % market share of solar modules , according to <unk> ' market intelligence report . 
 The PV industry has seen drops in module prices since 2008 . In late 2011 , factory @-@ gate prices for crystalline @-@ silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $ 1 @.@ 00 / W mark . The $ 1 @.@ 00 / W installed cost , is often regarded in the PV industry as marking the achievement of grid parity for PV . These reductions have taken many stakeholders , including industry analysts , by surprise , and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality . Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an <unk> basis to compete with conventional generation options . Yet technological advancements , manufacturing process improvements , and industry re @-@ structuring , mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years . 
 = = Non @-@ technical barriers to acceptance = = 
 Many energy markets , institutions , and policies have been developed to support the production and use of fossil fuels . Newer and cleaner technologies may offer social and environmental benefits , but utility operators often reject renewable resources because they are trained to think only in terms of big , conventional power plants . Consumers often ignore renewable power systems because they are not given accurate price signals about electricity consumption . Intentional market distortions ( such as subsidies ) , and unintentional market distortions ( such as split incentives ) may work against renewables . Benjamin K. <unk> has argued that " some of the most surreptitious , yet powerful , impediments facing renewable energy and energy efficiency in the United States are more about culture and institutions than engineering and science " . 
 The obstacles to the widespread commercialization of renewable energy technologies are primarily political , not technical , and there have been many studies which have identified a range of " non @-@ technical barriers " to renewable energy use . These barriers are impediments which put renewable energy at a marketing , institutional , or policy disadvantage relative to other forms of energy . Key barriers include : 
 Difficulty overcoming established energy systems , which includes difficulty introducing innovative energy systems , particularly for distributed generation such as photovoltaics , because of technological lock @-@ in , electricity markets designed for centralized power plants , and market control by established operators . As the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change points out : 
 National grids are usually tailored towards the operation of centralised power plants and thus favour their performance . Technologies that do not easily fit into these networks may struggle to enter the market , even if the technology itself is commercially viable . This applies to distributed generation as most grids are not suited to receive electricity from many small sources . Large @-@ scale renewables may also encounter problems if they are sited in areas far from existing grids . 
 Lack of government policy support , which includes the lack of policies and regulations supporting deployment of renewable energy technologies and the presence of policies and regulations hindering renewable energy development and supporting conventional energy development . Examples include subsidies for fossil @-@ fuels , insufficient consumer @-@ based renewable energy incentives , government underwriting for nuclear plant accidents , and complex zoning and permitting processes for renewable energy . 
 Lack of information dissemination and consumer awareness . 
 Higher capital cost of renewable energy technologies compared with conventional energy technologies . 
 Inadequate financing options for renewable energy projects , including insufficient access to affordable financing for project developers , entrepreneurs and consumers . 
 Imperfect capital markets , which includes failure to internalize all costs of conventional energy ( e.g. , effects of air pollution , risk of supply disruption ) and failure to internalize all benefits of renewable energy ( e.g. , cleaner air , energy security ) . 
 Inadequate workforce skills and training , which includes lack of adequate scientific , technical , and manufacturing skills required for renewable energy production ; lack of reliable installation , maintenance , and inspection services ; and failure of the educational system to provide adequate training in new technologies . 
 Lack of adequate codes , standards , utility interconnection , and net @-@ metering guidelines . 
 Poor public perception of renewable energy system aesthetics . 
 Lack of stakeholder / community participation and co @-@ operation in energy choices and renewable energy projects . 
 With such a wide range of non @-@ technical barriers , there is no " silver bullet " solution to drive the transition to renewable energy . So ideally there is a need for several different types of policy instruments to complement each other and overcome different types of barriers . 
 A policy framework must be created that will level the playing field and redress the imbalance of traditional approaches associated with fossil fuels . The policy landscape must keep pace with broad trends within the energy sector , as well as reflecting specific social , economic and environmental priorities . 
 = = Public policy landscape = = 
 Public policy has a role to play in renewable energy commercialization because the free market system has some fundamental limitations . As the Stern Review points out : 
 In a liberalised energy market , investors , operators and consumers should face the full cost of their decisions . But this is not the case in many economies or energy sectors . Many policies distort the market in favour of existing fossil fuel technologies . 
 The International Solar Energy Society has stated that " historical incentives for the conventional energy resources continue even today to bias markets by burying many of the real societal costs of their use " . 
 Fossil @-@ fuel energy systems have different production , transmission , and end @-@ use costs and characteristics than do renewable energy systems , and new promotional policies are needed to ensure that renewable systems develop as quickly and broadly as is socially desirable . 
 Lester Brown states that the market " does not incorporate the indirect costs of providing goods or services into prices , it does not value nature 's services adequately , and it does not respect the sustainable @-@ yield thresholds of natural systems " . It also favors the near term over the long term , thereby showing limited concern for future generations . Tax and subsidy shifting can help overcome these problems , though is also problematic to combine different international normative regimes regulating this issue . 
 = = = Shifting taxes = = = 
 Tax shifting has been widely discussed and endorsed by economists . It involves lowering income taxes while raising levies on environmentally destructive activities , in order to create a more responsive market . For example , a tax on coal that included the increased health care costs associated with breathing polluted air , the costs of acid rain damage , and the costs of climate disruption would encourage investment in renewable technologies . Several Western European countries are already shifting taxes in a process known there as environmental tax reform . 
 In 2001 , Sweden launched a new 10 @-@ year environmental tax shift designed to convert 30 billion kroner ( $ 3 @.@ 9 billion ) of income taxes to taxes on environmentally destructive activities . Other European countries with significant tax reform efforts are France , Italy , Norway , Spain , and the United Kingdom . Asia 's two leading economies , Japan and China , are considering carbon taxes . 
 = = = Shifting subsidies = = = 
 Just as there is a need for tax shifting , there is also a need for subsidy shifting . Subsidies are not an inherently bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes . The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30 years , only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded . In terms of specific examples , the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes . And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry . 
 Lester Brown has argued that " a world facing the prospect of economically disruptive climate change can no longer justify subsidies to expand the burning of coal and oil . Shifting these subsidies to the development of climate @-@ benign energy sources such as wind , solar , biomass , and geothermal power is the key to stabilizing the earth 's climate . " The International Solar Energy Society advocates " leveling the playing field " by redressing the continuing inequities in public subsidies of energy technologies and R & D , in which the fossil fuel and nuclear power receive the largest share of financial support . 
 Some countries are eliminating or reducing climate disrupting subsidies and Belgium , France , and Japan have phased out all subsidies for coal . Germany is reducing its coal subsidy . The subsidy dropped from $ 5 @.@ 4 billion in 1989 to $ 2 @.@ 8 billion in 2002 , and in the process Germany lowered its coal use by 46 percent . China cut its coal subsidy from $ 750 million in 1993 to $ 240 million in 1995 and more recently has imposed a high @-@ sulfur coal tax . However , the United States has been increasing its support for the fossil fuel and nuclear industries . 
 In November 2011 , an IEA report entitled Deploying Renewables 2011 said " subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits " . The IEA 's report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand . 
 A fair and efficient imposition of subsidies for renewable energies and aiming at sustainable development , however , require coordination and regulation at a global level , as subsidies granted in one country can easily disrupt industries and policies of others , thus underlining the relevance of this issue at the World Trade Organization . 
 = = = Renewable energy targets = = = 
 Setting national renewable energy targets can be an important part of a renewable energy policy and these targets are usually defined as a percentage of the primary energy and / or electricity generation mix . For example , the European Union has prescribed an indicative renewable energy target of 12 per cent of the total EU energy mix and 22 per cent of electricity consumption by 2010 . National targets for individual EU Member States have also been set to meet the overall target . Other developed countries with defined national or regional targets include Australia , Canada , Israel , Japan , Korea , New Zealand , Norway , Singapore , Switzerland , and some US States . 
 National targets are also an important component of renewable energy strategies in some developing countries . Developing countries with renewable energy targets include China , India , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Thailand , Brazil , Egypt , Mali , and South Africa . The targets set by many developing countries are quite modest when compared with those in some industrialized countries . 
 Renewable energy targets in most countries are indicative and nonbinding but they have assisted government actions and regulatory frameworks . The United Nations Environment Program has suggested that making renewable energy targets legally binding could be an important policy tool to achieve higher renewable energy market penetration . 
 = = = <unk> the playing field = = = 
 The IEA has identified three actions which will allow renewable energy and other clean energy technologies to " more effectively compete for private sector capital " . 
 " First , energy prices must appropriately reflect the " true cost " of energy ( e.g. through carbon pricing ) so that the positive and negative impacts of energy production and consumption are fully taken into account " . Example : New UK nuclear plants cost £ 92 @.@ 50 / MWh , whereas offshore wind farms in the UK are supported with € 74 @.@ 2 / MWh at a price of £ 150 in 2011 falling to £ 130 per MWh in 2022 . In Denmark , the price can be € 84 / MWh . 
 " Second , inefficient fossil fuel subsidies must be removed , while ensuring that all citizens have access to affordable energy " . 
 " Third , governments must develop policy frameworks that encourage private sector investment in lower @-@ carbon energy options " . 
 = = = Green stimulus programs = = = 
 In response to the global financial crisis in the late 2000s , the world 's major governments made " green stimulus " programs one of their main policy instruments for supporting economic recovery . Some US $ 188 billion in green stimulus funding had been allocated to renewable energy and energy efficiency , to be spent mainly in 2010 and in 2011 . 
 = = = Energy Sector Regulation = = = 
 Public policy determines the extent to which renewable energy ( RE ) is to be incorporated into a developed or developing country 's generation mix . Energy sector regulators implement that policy — thus affecting the pace and pattern of RE investments and connections to the grid . Energy regulators often have authority to carry out a number of functions that have implications for the financial feasibility of renewable energy projects . Such functions include issuing licenses , setting performance standards , monitoring the performance of regulated firms , determining the price level and structure of tariffs , establishing uniform systems of accounts , arbitrating stakeholder disputes ( like interconnection cost allocations ) , performing management audits , developing agency human resources ( expertise ) , reporting sector and commission activities to government authorities , and coordinating decisions with other government agencies . Thus , regulators make a wide range of decisions that affect the financial outcomes associated with RE investments . In addition , the sector regulator is in a position to give advice to the government regarding the full implications of focusing on climate change or energy security . The energy sector regulator is the natural advocate for efficiency and cost @-@ containment throughout the process of designing and implementing RE policies . Since policies are not self @-@ implementing , energy sector regulators become a key facilitator ( or blocker ) of renewable energy investments . 
 = = = Energy transition in Germany = = = 
 The Energiewende ( German for energy transition ) is the transition by Germany to a low carbon , environmentally sound , reliable , and affordable energy supply . The new system will rely heavily on renewable energy ( particularly wind , photovoltaics , and biomass ) energy efficiency , and energy demand management . Most if not all existing coal @-@ fired generation will need to be retired . The phase @-@ out of Germany 's fleet of nuclear reactors , to be complete by 2022 , is a key part of the program . 
 Legislative support for the Energiewende was passed in late 2010 and includes greenhouse gas ( GHG ) reductions of 80 – 95 % by 2050 ( relative to 1990 ) and a renewable energy target of 60 % by 2050 . These targets are ambitious . One Berlin policy institute noted that " while the German approach is not unique worldwide , the speed and scope of the Energiewende are exceptional " . The Energiewende also seeks a greater transparency in relation to national energy policy formation . 
 Germany has made significant progress on its GHG emissions reduction target , achieving a 27 % decrease between 1990 and 2014 . However Germany will need to maintain an average GHG emissions abatement rate of 3 @.@ 5 % per annum to reach its Energiewende goal , equal to the maximum historical value thus far . 
 Germany spends € 1 @.@ 5 billion per annum on energy research ( 2013 figure ) in an effort to solve the technical and social issues raised by the transition . This includes a number of computer studies that have confirmed the feasibility and a similar cost ( relative to business @-@ as @-@ usual and given that carbon is adequately priced ) of the Energiewende . 
 These initiatives go well beyond European Union legislation and the national policies of other European states . The policy objectives have been embraced by the German federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables , particularly wind power . Germany 's share of renewables has increased from around 5 % in 1999 to 22 @.@ 9 % in 2012 , surpassing the OECD average of 18 % usage of renewables . Producers have been guaranteed a fixed feed @-@ in tariff for 20 years , guaranteeing a fixed income . Energy co @-@ operatives have been created , and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits . The large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market . However , in some cases poor investment designs have caused bankruptcies and low returns , and unrealistic promises have been shown to be far from reality . Nuclear power plants were closed , and the existing nine plants will close earlier than planned , in 2022 . 
 One factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure to bring the power to market . It is believed 8 @,@ 300 km of power lines must be built or upgraded . The different German States have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines . Industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the Energiewende have been passed on to consumers , who have had rising electricity bills . 
 = = Voluntary market mechanisms for renewable electricity = = 
 Voluntary markets , also referred to as green power markets , are driven by consumer preference . Voluntary markets allow a consumer to choose to do more than policy decisions require and reduce the environmental impact of their electricity use . Voluntary green power products must offer a significant benefit and value to buyers to be successful . Benefits may include zero or reduced greenhouse gas emissions , other pollution reductions or other environmental improvements on power stations . 
 The driving force behind voluntary green electricity within the EU are the liberalized electricity markets and the RES Directive . According to the directive the EU Member States must ensure that the origin of electricity produced from renewables can be guaranteed and therefore a " guarantee of origin " must be issued ( article 15 ) . Environmental organisations are using the voluntary market to create new renewables and improving sustainability of the existing power production . In the US the main tool to track and stimulate voluntary actions is Green @-@ e program managed by Center for Resource Solutions . In Europe the main voluntary tool used by the NGOs to promote sustainable electricity production is <unk> label . 
 = = Recent developments = = 
 A number of events in 2006 pushed renewable energy up the political agenda , including the US mid @-@ term elections in November , which confirmed clean energy as a mainstream issue . Also in 2006 , the Stern Review made a strong economic case for investing in low carbon technologies now , and argued that economic growth need not be incompatible with cutting energy consumption . According to a trend analysis from the United Nations Environment Programme , climate change concerns coupled with recent high oil prices and increasing government support are driving increasing rates of investment in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries . 
 Investment capital flowing into renewable energy reached a record US $ 77 billion in 2007 , with the upward trend continuing in 2008 . The OECD still dominates , but there is now increasing activity from companies in China , India and Brazil . Chinese companies were the second largest recipient of venture capital in 2006 after the United States . In the same year , India was the largest net buyer of companies abroad , mainly in the more established European markets . 
 New government spending , regulation , and policies helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better than many other sectors . Most notably , U.S. President Barack Obama 's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included more than $ 70 billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs . This policy @-@ stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in U.S. history for renewables , advanced transportation , and energy conservation initiatives . Based on these new rules , many more utilities strengthened their clean @-@ energy programs . Clean Edge suggests that the commercialization of clean energy will help countries around the world deal with the current economic malaise . Once @-@ promising solar energy company , <unk> , became involved in a political controversy involving U.S. President Barack Obama 's administration 's authorization of a $ 535 million loan guarantee to the Corporation in 2009 as part of a program to promote alternative energy growth . The company ceased all business activity , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy , and laid @-@ off nearly all of its employees in early September 2011 . 
 In his 24 January 2012 , State of the Union address , President Barack Obama restated his commitment to renewable energy . Obama said that he " will not walk away from the promise of clean energy . " Obama called for a commitment by the Defense Department to purchase 1 @,@ 000 MW of renewable energy . He also mentioned the long @-@ standing Interior Department commitment to permit 10 @,@ 000 MW of renewable energy projects on public land in 2012 . 
 As of 2012 , renewable energy plays a major role in the energy mix of many countries globally . Renewables are becoming increasingly economic in both developing and developed countries . Prices for renewable energy technologies , primarily wind power and solar power , continued to drop , making renewables competitive with conventional energy sources . Without a level playing field , however , high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on a robust promotional policies . Fossil fuel subsidies , which are far higher than those for renewable energy , remain in place and quickly need to be phased out . 
 United Nations ' Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon has said that " renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity " . In October 2011 , he " announced the creation of a high @-@ level group to drum up support for energy access , energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy . The group is to be co @-@ chaired by <unk> <unk> , the chair of UN Energy and director general of the UN Industrial Development Organisation , and Charles Holliday , chairman of Bank of America " . 
 Worldwide use of solar power and wind power continued to grow significantly in 2012 . Solar electricity consumption increased by 58 percent , to 93 terawatt @-@ hours ( TWh ) . Use of wind power in 2012 increased by 18 @.@ 1 percent , to 521 @.@ 3 TWh . Global solar and wind energy installed capacities continued to expand even though new investments in these technologies declined during 2012 . Worldwide investment in solar power in 2012 was $ 140 @.@ 4 billion , an 11 percent decline from 2011 , and wind power investment was down 10 @.@ 1 percent , to $ 80 @.@ 3 billion . But due to lower production costs for both technologies , total installed capacities grew sharply . This investment decline , but growth in installed capacity , may again occur in 2013 . Analysts expect the market to triple by 2030 . In 2015 , investment in renewables exceeded fossils . 
 = = 100 % renewable energy = = 
 The incentive to use 100 % renewable energy for electricity , transport , or even total primary energy supply globally , has been motivated by global warming and other ecological as well as economic concerns . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand . In reviewing 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth , the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17 % of total energy by 2030 , and 27 % by 2050 ; the highest forecast projected 43 % supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77 % by 2050 . Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated . At the national level , at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 % of energy supply . Also , Professors S. <unk> and Robert H. <unk> have developed a series of " stabilization wedges " that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change , and " renewable energy sources , " in aggregate , constitute the largest number of their " wedges . " 
 Mark Z. Jacobson , professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University and director of its Atmosphere and Energy Program says producing all new energy with wind power , solar power , and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050 . Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be " primarily social and political , not technological or economic " . Jacobson says that energy costs with a wind , solar , water system should be similar to today 's energy costs . 
 Similarly , in the United States , the independent National Research Council has noted that " sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change , energy security , and the escalation of energy costs … Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States , taken collectively , can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand . " . 
 The most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large @-@ scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological . According to the 2013 Post Carbon Pathways report , which reviewed many international studies , the key roadblocks are : climate change denial , the fossil fuels lobby , political inaction , unsustainable energy consumption , outdated energy infrastructure , and financial constraints . 
 = = Energy efficiency = = 
 Moving towards energy sustainability will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied , but in the way it is used , and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential . Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side , and often offer significant economic benefits . 
 A sustainable energy economy requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency . Renewable energy and energy efficiency are said to be the " twin pillars " of sustainable energy policy . The American Council for an Energy @-@ Efficient Economy has explained that both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions : 
 Efficiency is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use . If energy use grows too fast , renewable energy development will chase a receding target . Likewise , unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly , slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions ; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed . 
 The IEA has stated that renewable energy and energy efficiency policies are complementary tools for the development of a sustainable energy future , and should be developed together instead of being developed in isolation .

 Matthew Allen Hughes ( born October 13 , 1973 ) is an American retired mixed martial artist , two @-@ time UFC Welterweight Champion , UFC Hall of Fame inductee , and NJCAA Hall of Fame inductee . During his tenures in the Ultimate Fighting Championship , Hughes put together two separate six @-@ fight winning streaks , defeated all the available opposition in the welterweight division , and defended the belt a then @-@ record seven times . Hughes was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in May 2010 during the UFC Fan Expo in conjunction with UFC 114 . 
 During his reign , Hughes was widely considered the # 1 pound @-@ for @-@ pound mixed martial artist in the world . Hughes was also regarded by many analysts and several media outlets as one of the greatest welterweight fighters of all time , as well as one of the greatest pound @-@ for @-@ pound fighters in the sport 's history . 
 A long @-@ time member of Miletich Fighting Systems , Hughes left the Miletich camp in late 2007 to start Team Hughes . In 2008 , Hughes published his autobiography , Made in America , which made the New York Times bestseller list . In 2011 , Hughes became host of Outdoor Channel 's Trophy Hunters TV . Hughes has no nickname ; although because of his success against Gracie jiu @-@ jitsu practitioners such as Royce Gracie , Renzo Gracie , Ricardo Almeida , and Matt Serra , people often refer to him as " the Gracie Killer " ( same as Sakuraba 's nickname ) . His mastery of Brazilian jiu @-@ jitsu , and having trained with 18 black belt holders in BJJ are also the reasons why Joe Rogan thinks he deserved to get a black belt for BJJ , even when he probably won 't wear it .

 Hughes was a two @-@ time 145 lb IHSA ( Illinois High School Association ) Class A state wrestling champion . He won in 1991 and 1992 while attending Hillsboro High School ( Illinois ) . During his junior and senior years , Matt went undefeated and won back @-@ to @-@ back state championships in the 145 lb class . Over the final three years of high school , he totaled 131 wins against only 2 losses , both during his sophomore year ( sophomore 43 @-@ 2 ; junior 43 @-@ 0 ; senior 45 @-@ 0 ) . 
 His college career started at Southwestern Illinois College . Hughes placed fifth in the nation at 158 lb . After Southwestern dropped their wrestling program , Hughes transferred to Lincoln College , where he placed third in the nation , notching a 33 @-@ 3 record for the Lynx . 
 After graduation Matt continued wrestling at Eastern Illinois University , where he was a two @-@ time NCAA Division I All @-@ American placing eighth in 1996 and fifth in 1997 at 158 lb . He finished with an 80 @-@ 15 record for Eastern Illinois . 
 Hughes competed in the prestigious ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship , in which he held a record of 2 – 2 , beating Ricardo Almeida and Jeremy Horn , and losing to Jeff Monson and Tito Ortiz .

 Hughes made his mixed martial arts debut on January 1 , 1998 . He slammed his opponent to the ground in just fifteen seconds , winning via KO . The slam became his signature move . He won his next fight via submission due to strikes . Hughes fought three times at Extreme Challenge 21 , on October 17 , 1998 defeating Victor Hunsaker via TKO and future UFC <unk> Champion Dave <unk> via unanimous decision . In the third fight of that night he lost to then @-@ undefeated Dennis Hallman by technical submission ( guillotine choke ) at 0 : 17 of the first round . The result was announced as a KO . In the process , Hallman handed Hughes his first professional defeat .

 Matt Hughes made his promotional debut at UFC 22 : There Can Be Only One Champion , on September 24 , 1999 , defeating Bulgarian Valeri <unk> via unanimous decision after three rounds . 
 He returned to the promotion at UFC 26 : Ultimate Field of Dreams , where he defeated Marcelo Aguiar via TKO , throwing some elbows which cut Aguiar and forced the doctor to end the match . The stoppage came at 4 : 34 of the first round . 
 Hughes faced Dennis Hallman in a rematch at UFC 29 : Defense of the Belts . At this point in their careers , Hallman was the only man to have defeated Hughes in MMA competition . Hughes lost the fight via armbar in only twenty seconds . When the bout started , Hughes lifted and brutally slammed Hallman to the mat , but was caught in the submission after landing in side @-@ control .

 Hughes won his first UFC World Welterweight title at UFC 34 : High Voltage on November 2 , 2001 . In a come @-@ from @-@ behind fight , Hughes was caught in a triangle choke by then @-@ champion Carlos Newton , but he lifted Newton in the air and slammed him to the mat , causing Newton to hit his head and lose consciousness just as Hughes was himself on the verge of blacking out from the choke . After the match Carlos stated that he felt the reason Hughes fell to the mat was because he was rendered unconscious from the triangle choke . This was confirmed by Hughes himself upon reviewing the tape of the match Hughes can be heard telling his corner after the fight " I was out " . The result was officially announced as a KO at 1 : 27 of the second round . The slam is considered to be one of the greatest in MMA history . 
 He successfully defended his championship belt at UFC 36 : Worlds Collide , defeating former Shooto Middleweight Champion Hayato Sakurai via TKO due to strikes at 3 : 01 of the fourth round . In the first round of the fight , Hughes spent all the time either clinching Sakurai up against the fence , or ripping his feet out from under him . In round 2 , Sakurai landed a right hand that sent Hughes to the mat ; despite this , Matt won the round by spending three minutes hitting Sakurai with elbows from the top position . At the start of the third round , Hughes quickly slammed Sakurai to the ground , again staying three minutes on top . He looked too strong for Sakurai . Hughes finished the bout in the 4th round , by taking down Sakurai and transitioning to full mount . After one minute of ground @-@ and @-@ pound onslaught , the contest was over as Sakurai had no answer for the champion . 
 Hughes faced Carlos Newton in their subsequent rematch at the main event of UFC 38 : Brawl at the Hall , in the promotion 's debut in the United Kingdom . He won the fight by technical knockout when he successfully trapped Newton in a modified crucifix position , which allowed him to rain unanswered blows on Newton 's face until the referee stopped the contest at 3 : 27 of round 4 . 
 In his next title defense , Hughes fought Gil Castillo at UFC 40 : Vendetta , defeating the former Middleweight contender via TKO . Hughes started the match with a big slam and then began to attack from Castillo 's guard with elbows and punches . Hughes easily avoided any submission attempts and looked far stronger than Castillo . As he passed to half guard , Castillo was bleeding above his left eye . The challenger 's only offense was a weak triangle choke that went nowhere . The round ended with Hughes on top , ground @-@ and @-@ pounding his opponent . Between rounds doctors ruled that the resulting cut was too severe to continue , and Hughes was declared the winner due to stoppage . 
 At UFC 42 : Sudden Impact , Hughes faced future UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk , winning via unanimous decision . Hughes started the action by taking Sherk down immediately , passing to half guard . Sherk was able to stand for a few seconds before Hughes took him down again . In round two , they started to trade punches , but eventually Hughes took Sherk down . Like the first round , they stood up for a moment . At the beginning of the third round , Sherk took Hughes down , while Hughes attempted a kimura from the bottom . A late stand up led to a second takedown by Sherk . Round 4 saw Hughes using his strength to control the challenger on the ground . Sherk took Hughes down again in the fifth round , but the champion controlled the rest of the time sprawl @-@ and @-@ brawling as he finished on top . With the victory , he became the first man to ever defeat Sherk . 
 Hughes faced former <unk> Welterweight Champion Frank Trigg at the main event of UFC 45 : Revolution . This event marked UFC 's 10th anniversary .

 He kept the title until UFC 46 : Supernatural , when he was submitted by Hawaiian Brazilian Jiu @-@ Jitsu specialist B.J. Penn via rear naked choke at 4 : 39 of the first round , in a fight he was heavily favored to win . The title was vacated upon a contract dispute between Penn and UFC who promptly stripped him of the welterweight title , claiming Penn had breached his contract and that the signing constituted him refusing to defend his title . Penn filed suit against UFC and publicized his side of the conflict , claiming his contract had expired . Penn filed a motion to stop UFC from awarding a new welterweight title , but that motion was denied . 
 Hughes faced Penn 's training partner Renato <unk> at UFC 48 : Payback , winning via unanimous decision ( 30 @-@ 27 ; 30 @-@ 27 ; 29 @-@ 28 ) . He was caught in a very tight triangle choke in the first round , but after winning the second and third rounds , was awarded with the victory . 
 Hughes regained the vacant welterweight title by submitting Canadian contender Georges St @-@ Pierre via armbar in the final second of the first round at UFC 50 : The War of ' 04 . The fight was competitive . Hughes took GSP down twice and landed a huge slam . Hughes was in trouble at the beginning of the bout as St @-@ Pierre unloaded a spinning back kick into his ribs . The submission earned Hughes his second Tapout of the Night . Obviously disappointed at the time , St. Pierre admitted afterward that he had lost before he ever stepped into the Octagon . He had regarded Hughes as his idol , not as someone he could beat . 
 Hughes successfully retained his title against Trigg in their historical rematch at UFC 52 : Couture vs. Liddell 2 . Accidentally hit in the groin early in the first round , Hughes looked to the referee for assistance ; however , the referee had not seen the strike and Trigg capitalized on Hughes ' distraction by staggering him with a barrage of punches . The fight quickly went to the ground , with Trigg ground @-@ and @-@ pounding Hughes , then attempting a rear naked choke . After nearly two minutes of struggling , Hughes broke free , picked Trigg up , carried him across the Octagon and slammed him to the ground . Hughes then ground @-@ and @-@ pounded Trigg before securing the victory with a rear naked choke of his own , in what is considered one of the greatest fights and comebacks in MMA history . This fight is UFC President Dana White 's favorite match in combat sport history . He was awarded the Tapout of the Night for the third time in his career . 
 Hughes ' next fight took place at UFC 56 : Full Force , where he was scheduled to fight Judo practitioner Karo Parisyan . After <unk> suffered a hamstring injury and could not fight , Joe Riggs took his place . The match was originally scheduled as a title bout , but since Riggs could not meet the 170 @-@ pound weight limit , it became a non @-@ title fight . It marked the first time for the UFC that a title fight had to be called off for this reason . 
 Hughes defeated Riggs in the first round by submission via kimura from the half @-@ guard at 3 : 28 . The armlock earned Hughes his last Tapout of the Night award . 
 At UFC 60 : Hughes vs. Gracie , on May 27 , 2006 , Hughes defeated Brazilian Jiu @-@ Jitsu legend and UFC Hall of Famer Royce Gracie in a non @-@ title , catch @-@ weight bout by TKO ( strikes ) at 4 : 39 of the first round . Before the stoppage , Gracie was caught in an armlock from the side mount position ; although Hughes appeared to have the submission in place , Gracie would not tap out . Hughes stated that he felt his arm pop and realized he would never tap , so instead of breaking his arm , opted to seek a different position . The event drew 620 @,@ 000 buys , becoming the best @-@ selling pay @-@ per @-@ view in UFC history , and was the first to break the $ 20 million mark in gross PPV sales . 
 Hughes was scheduled to fight Georges St @-@ Pierre in a rematch at UFC 63 , but after St @-@ Pierre sustained a severe groin injury , the UFC announced that B.J. Penn would replace him in the title fight . At this point in their careers , Penn was the only mixed martial artist to beat Hughes after March 2001 . In fact , it was Hughes ' only loss in his last 19 fights . In the bout , Penn controlled the first two rounds , but sustained a rib injury during the scramble to take Hughes ' back in round two . He was visibly different in the third round , appearing exhausted and missing punches he was landing earlier . Hughes was able to take Penn to the mat , and in side @-@ control crucifix position rained punches on Penn 's head until referee " Big " John McCarthy stopped the fight at 3 : 53 of the third round . In the process , Hughes became the first man to ever stop Penn in a fight . Both fighters were awarded the Fight of the Night bonus .

 Immediately after the Alves fight , Hughes stated that he had " one more fight " left in him , and that he wanted to fight Matt Serra . Their rivalry stemmed from the time when Serra was a contestant on The Ultimate Fighter and Hughes was guest coach . Serra did not like the way Hughes criticized other contestants on the show and was disgusted when Hughes constantly picked on Georges St @-@ Pierre during a lunch break and bragged about his submission victory . On January 9 , 2009 , Hughes confirmed on his blog that UFC 98 would likely be the day he and Serra met in the Octagon . UFC confirmed the fight .

 = Matthew McCauley ( politician ) = 
 Matthew McCauley ( July 11 , 1850 – October 25 , 1930 ) was the first mayor of the city of Edmonton , and a member of the legislative assemblies of both the Northwest Territories and Alberta . 
 McCauley was born into a farming family in what would become the province of Ontario to an Irish father and Canadian mother . His restless nature and desire for adventure led him to travel west to Manitoba . In Manitoba , he established a livery business , which he ran until he set off for Edmonton in 1879 . He farmed for two years in Fort Saskatchewan before finally moving to Edmonton , where he established the settlement 's first livery and cartage business . 
 Along with a couple prominent Edmonton citizens , he formed an association aimed to restore order in the area , settling many disputes , including during the 1885 Riel Rebellion as its captain . He soon established a school board , recognizing the need for a school , which he served as president and trustee for 18 years . Shortly before Edmonton was incorporated as a town in 1892 , he formed the Board of Trade . Upon the incorporation , he was acclaimed the town 's first mayor in 1892 , and the next two following years . He did not run for re @-@ election at the end of his third term , opting to run for the seat representing Edmonton on the Territorial Legislature , which he served for six years . Following his defeat moved to Tofield , Alberta farm until 1905 , when he returned to Edmonton and was elected to the new Legislative Assembly of Alberta . The following year , he resigned his seat to serve as the first warden of the province 's first penitentiary . After five years as warden , he moved to British Columbia to fruit farm , but he moved back to Sexsmith , Alberta 13 years later to farm , where he died in 1930 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Matthew McCauley was born July 11 , 1850 in Owen Sound , Ontario to Alexander and Eleanor ( née Latimer ) McCauley . His father Alexander was an Irish immigrant who was born in Antrim . He moved to Canada at the age of five , and went on to become a successful farmer . Though his early years were described as him being a " typical farm boy " of the time , he received schooling from the Owen Sound Public School . McCauley desired to follow in the footsteps of this father as a farmer after his completing his education , but his restless nature and passion for adventure set him off to the west , where he first set off to Fort Garry in Manitoba . 
 McCauley established a livery business , the first of the kind in Fort Garry ( later Winnipeg ) . He married Matilda Benson of Sarnia , Ontario in 1875 , and resided in Fort Garry with her for the next four years , where he continued to operate his livery business . After growing restless in Winnipeg in 1879 , McCauley sold his business and traveled west , this time to Edmonton . McCauley arrived in Edmonton in the fall of 1879 after 21 days of travelling by ox cart . He purchased a farm in Fort Saskatchewan the following spring , and farmed for two years before moving to Edmonton in 1882 . In Edmonton , he opened the town 's first livery and cartage business , the Edmonton Cartage Company , and a butcher shop in 1883 .

 = = = Protective Association = = = 
 McCauley arrived in Edmonton at the time of what has been described " one of the biggest conflicts ever . " The Hudson 's Bay Company has recently surveyed lots of land that were intended to be sold as property , however word broke out that the particular are of land was the only land surveyed in the entire district . People attracted to the area were unable to afford land , and therefore built shacks . As more claim @-@ jumpers moved in , it was requested that they move three or four miles outwards , but they refused . McCauley sent many urgent messages to Ottawa to settle the dispute in a civil manner , but to no avail . As a result of the government not being able to do anything , and the lack of a law enforcement agency in the town , a group of prominent citizens formed a " Protective Association " as an attempt to restore law and order , to which McCauley was elected its captain . 
 As captain , McCauley tried hard to settle the dispute and reach a compromise with the claim @-@ jumpers who " had no desire for a peaceful settlement . " He was involved in a brief altercation with a claim jumper whom he approached and ordered to move . The man was armed with two revolvers and refused to move , therefore McCauley and his crew jacked the shack off its foundation and sent it down the riverbank . The Protective Association , however was involved in a legal problems brought up by the claim jumpers , for " willful damage to property . " The brief trial resulted in McCauley , as the captain being fined 40 dollars , and six other members of the committee found guilty , but being let off with court costs and an order to replace the damaged property . The Protective Association eventually managed to restore peace and order in Edmonton , and claim jumpers eventually decided that the area was not the place to build on once the land for the townsite was surveyed by the Hudson 's Bay Company . 
 = = = Edmonton School Board = = = 
 After realizing Edmonton as a suitable place for raising his children , McCauley soon recognized the community 's need for a school . McCauley led a group of prominent men and arranged for a school to be built on land donated by the Hudson 's Bay Company . The school opened in on January 2 , 1882 . Three years after the opening of the school , McCauley found himself and a small group of people paying off bills for the school . Initially , McCauley suggested that land owners be taxed with the funds going to the school , but protest followed . McCauley then decided to propose that Edmonton be designated as an official school district by the government in Ottawa , which was voted in favor of following a close vote . The school district was successfully negotiated with Ottawa , and it became the first of its kind in the North @-@ West Territories . Edmonton became known as having the " finest school system in the west of Portage la Prairie " that set an example for many other following cities . McCauley served as chairman of the newly formed School Board from 1885 to 1888 , when he stepped down , although he served as a trustee for 18 years following . He was nicknamed " Edmonton 's Father of Education " in honour of his efforts to bring an education system to the community . 
 = = = Rebellion of 1885 = = = 
 During the Riel Rebellion in 1885 , news of the Frog Lake Massacre spread to Edmonton , invoking fear to many residents .

 = = = Mayor of Edmonton = = = 
 In 1889 , McCauley co @-@ founded ( with Frank Oliver and John Alexander McDougall ) the Edmonton Board of Trade , forerunner to the Chamber of Commerce . 
 When Edmonton was incorporated as a town on January 9 , 1892 , it held its first election in 1892 with McCauley acclaimed as mayor as no other candidates had put their names forth . Among his concerns during his first term were to " establish order " among the scattered shacks near the trading post , and widening various streets around the town , in preparation for what he envisioned in the future of Edmonton becoming a " busy metropolitan " . He was re @-@ acclaimed in 1893 and 1894 before stepping aside voluntarily after his third term , never having been contested in an election . During his term as mayor , the Canadian government decided to move the Dominion Land Office from Edmonton to Strathcona , which was then a separate community , on the south side of the North Saskatchewan River . Upon the arrival of government agents to carry out the move , citizens quickly set up a resistance . Headed by McCauley and a group of prominent citizens including councillor John Cameron , Angry Edmontonians descended on the office , cut horses loose and tore to pieces the wagon that the officer was packing with records for transportation . The situation escalated quickly , becoming heated , from which McCauley called on the people to relent as they would request reconsideration from Ottawa . Later that same day , the decision was reversed . In 1893 , he went to Ottawa to enter negotiations with the federal government for a street railway system . McCauley was successful , and the system became the first in the west . He also advocated for federal government assistance in building a railway bridge over the North Saskatchewan River for the existing Edmonton @-@ Calgary rail connection , which was completed in 1900 . McCauley also saw Edmonton 's need for a hospital , and consequently established what later became Grey Nuns Hospital , arranging for the Grey Nuns to establish at the town , along with a nurse . 
 In 1896 , McCauley re @-@ sought election to Town Council , this time as alderman . He was easily elected , finishing first of eight candidates in an election in which the top six were elected . He served a single term , and did not seek re @-@ election the following election . 
 = = = Territorial and provincial = = = 
 Following his decision not to run for re @-@ election as mayor in 1893 , three years later , McCauley sought to be Edmonton 's representative in the North @-@ West Territories Legislature . During his term as representative , he worked to upgrade Edmonton 's school system , along with upgrading the town 's trade industry . He served in this capacity until 1902 , when he was defeated . During his time , McCauley kept his focus on his development of the school system , introducing a single tax bill intended to give schools boards power to adopt the tax . 
 In 1901 , McCauley sold Edmonton Cartage Company and used the proceeds to buy one thousand acres ( 4 km ² ) of farmland at Beaver Lake , near Tofield , Alberta , where he farmed until returning to Edmonton in 1905 . While in Tofield , he married Annie Cookson - his first wife , Matilda , had died in 1896 - with whom he had four children , bringing his total to twelve . 
 Upon Alberta becoming a province in 1905 , McCauley returned to Edmonton and was elected as a Liberal member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the riding of Vermilion in the province 's first general election . During his tenure , he had introduced many bills to the house , and advocated for a university to be founded . 
 McCauley played a vital role in Edmonton being chosen as the provincial capital city . In a speech , he pointed out the ongoing development at the northern town of Peace River , Alberta , and how Edmonton would be the " logical centre of the province " . 
 = = Later career = = 
 McCauley resigned his seat in the Legislature the following year after he was elected , after his appointment to be warden of the Edmonton Penitentiary , the first of its kind in Alberta . It was said that his reputation of " honesty , fairness and ability to keep law and order " was a contributing factor in his appointment . In the years he served in the capacity , McCauley instituted a number of new practices , including creating labour jobs for prisoners , like producing bricks , concrete , clothing and tools . Prisoners were also to garden to produce their own food , and by the end of his tenure as warden , a coal mine was formed . He was greatly respected amongst his colleagues , and it was said that " he never once had a complaint against him from either staff nor inmates . " 
 McCauley resigned as warden in 1912 to become a fruit farmer in Penticton in the Okanagan valley . After thirteen years farming in Penticton , he moved to Sexsmith , Alberta to farm on a recently bought 1000 @-@ acre farm .

 McCauley married Matilda Benson of Sarnia , Ontario in 1875 , in which he would remain married to until her sudden death in 1896 . He married once again in 1902 , to Annie Cookson , originally from Manchester , England . He had seven children with his first wife Matilda – Alexander , Lilly Bell , Margaret Alberta , Mabel , Maud , Frank and May . With Annie Cookson he had four children , Georgina , John , Raymond and Ada . 
 McCauley was an active member of the Edmonton community . He served as a director of the Edmonton Agricultural Association for 16 years . The association brought the Edmonton Exhibition to Edmonton , one of the prominent fairs of the west at the time . As telephone service was brought to Edmonton , McCauley was one of the first to receive one installed . His telephone number was # 1 . When John Hamilton @-@ Gordon , 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and <unk> would visit Edmonton for business , McCauley and his wife would usually be the ones to entertain him . Also an avid curler , McCauley was a founder of the Royal Curling Club in Edmonton and led his curling team where he served as a skip . He also enjoyed other sports , including horse carriage racing . 
 McCauley School was named his honour in 1912 , for his work in pioneering the public school board .

 = Operation Rösselsprung ( 1944 ) = 
 Operation Rösselsprung ( Knight 's move ) was a combined airborne and ground assault by the German XV Mountain Corps and their allies on the Supreme Headquarters of the Yugoslav Partisans located in the Bosnian town of Drvar in the Independent State of Croatia during World War II . The operation was launched on 25 May 1944 , and was aimed at capturing or killing Marshal Josip Broz Tito and destroying the headquarters , support facilities and co @-@ located Allied military missions . It is associated with the Seventh Enemy Offensive ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> neprijateljska ofenziva ) in Yugoslav history . The airborne assault itself is also known as the Raid on Drvar ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> na Drvar ) . 
 Operation Rösselsprung was a coup de main operation , involving direct action by a combined parachute and glider @-@ borne assault by the 500th SS Parachute Battalion and a planned subsequent link @-@ up with ground forces of the XV Mountain Corps converging on Drvar . The airborne assault was preceded by heavy bombing of the town by the Luftwaffe . The ground forces included Home Guard forces of the Independent State of Croatia . 
 Tito , his principal headquarters staff and the Allied military personnel escaped , despite their presence in Drvar at the time of the airborne assault . The operation failed due to a number of factors , including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar . The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito 's exact location and the lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Axis Case White and Case Black offensives of the first six months of 1943 caused significant setbacks for the Partisans ; however , in September Tito took advantage of the capitulation of Italy and managed to increase the territory under his control and double his forces in size to around 200 @,@ 000 men , arming them with captured Italian weapons . In late November , he held a National Congress at Jajce in the liberated area of northwestern Yugoslavia and designated himself Marshal and Prime Minister . He established his headquarters nearby at Drvar in the Dinaric Alps and temporarily suspended his successful tactic of being constantly on the move . Generalfeldmarschall Maximilian von Weichs , the Wehrmacht Commander @-@ in @-@ chief Southeast Europe , admitted a few weeks later that " Tito is our most dangerous enemy . " 
 Drvar was located within the territory of the German puppet state , the Independent State of Croatia ( which included Bosnia and Herzegovina ) . Tito 's personal headquarters was initially located in a cave about 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) north of the centre of Drvar . The Unac River ran along the base of the ridge line above the cave , creating an obstacle to movement between the town and the cave , and a rail line ran along the ridge line behind the cave . In addition to Partisan headquarters , various Partisan and Communist Party of Yugoslavia support , training and youth organisations were also based in and around Drvar at the time , along with the Tito Escort Battalion which was responsible for his personal safety . The British and Soviet military missions to the Partisans were also stationed in villages close to Drvar , as were some United States military officers on various missions . The British mission was headed by Brigadier Fitzroy Maclean , who was in London at the time of the raid , and included Major Randolph Churchill , son of Winston Churchill . At the time of Operation Rösselsprung ( German : Unternehmen Rösselsprung ) , the British mission was led by its second @-@ in @-@ command , Lieutenant Colonel Vivian Street . 
 = = Partisan dispositions around Drvar = = 
 Apart from Partisan headquarters and related organisations close in and around Drvar , there were between 12 @,@ 000 and 16 @,@ 000 Partisans in the area of operations that would be subject to the ground assault by XV Mountain Corps . In the immediate vicinity of Drvar was the 1st Proletarian Corps commanded by Koča Popović , which consisted of the elite 1st Proletarian and 6th Lika Proletarian Divisions , with the Corps headquarters located in the village of <unk> , 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) east of Drvar . The 6th Lika Proletarian Division was west of Drvar , and the 1st Proletarian Division was deployed in the area around Jajce and Mrkonjić Grad , some 50 km east of Drvar . The nearest large Partisan formation to Drvar was the 3rd Lika Proletarian Brigade of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division based in the <unk> and <unk> villages some 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) south and southwest of Drvar . 
 In the wider area of operations were the Partisan 5th Corps commanded by Slavko <unk> and 8th Corps commanded by Vlado Ćetković . The 5th Corps was deployed to the northeast and northwest of Drvar with its headquarters south of the Mrkonjić Grad – Ključ road , and the 8th Corps was positioned to the southeast with its headquarters in the mountains between the Glamoč and Livno valleys . Importantly for the coming battle , the 4th Krajina Division of the 5th Corps was deployed between Bihać and Bosanski Petrovac . Two brigades of the 4th Krajina Division and one brigade from the 39th Krajina Division formed a defensive arc north of Drvar , running from Bihać through Krupa to Sanski Most . The 9th Dalmatian Division of the 8th Corps was deployed to the south between Livno and Bosansko Grahovo . 
 = = German intelligence = = 
 Three organisations attempted to determine the location of Tito 's headquarters and the disposition of Partisan forces in Drvar . The first of these was the <unk> Special Unit of Section II of the Abwehr ( the Wehrmacht intelligence service ) , some members of which had been involved in identifying Tito 's presence in the town of Jajce prior to the German offensive to retake the town . The <unk> Special Unit was part of the Brandenburg Division , and was staffed by ethnic Germans who spoke local languages . The unit had many contacts with both the Chetniks and Ustaše Militia , and had been tracking Tito since October 1943 . Leutnant Kirchner of that unit had been responsible for locating Tito prior to the re @-@ capture of Jajce , and he established a patrol base near Bosansko Grahovo . He got very close to the Drvar cave , and located the Allied military missions , but despite German radio intercepts confirming that Drvar was the site of Tito 's headquarters , Kirchner was unable to pinpoint the cave as the location of the headquarters . Kirchner was attached to the 500th SS Parachute Battalion for the operation . 
 The second intelligence organisation was FAT ( Front Reconnaissance Troop ) 216 of Section I of the Abwehr . <unk> , commanded by Leutnant Zavadil , was also attached to the 500th SS Parachute Battalion , but did not contribute much to the intelligence used to plan the raid . 
 On Hitler 's orders , SS @-@ Sturmbannführer Otto Skorzeny of the Sicherheitsdienst ( SD ) ( the intelligence branch of the SS ) , who had commanded the operation to rescue Mussolini in September 1943 , was independently involved in intelligence gathering in the lead @-@ up to the raid . Skorzeny acted on behalf of the SD , and after obtaining information from a Partisan deserter that pinpointed Tito 's headquarters at the cave , he proposed a plan to infiltrate Drvar with a small group of soldiers to assassinate Tito . Skorzeny soon discovered that the plan to eliminate Tito had been compromised , and had nothing further to do with the operation . It appears that he did not pass on the useful intelligence he had gathered to SS @-@ Hauptsturmführer Kurt Rybka , the commander of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion , who was responsible for planning the critical airborne aspects of the operation . Largely due to interservice rivalry and competition , the three organisations did not share the intelligence they gathered , which had a significant effect on the tactical planning and execution of the operation . 
 = = Partisan intelligence = = 
 The Partisans had their own highly effective intelligence network . They had been aware of the presence of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion in Yugoslavia for some time , and had been aware of the general threat of an airborne assault for over six months . They may have become aware of the isolation of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion or the concentration of transport aircraft and gliders at Zagreb and Banja Luka over a month before the operation . The Partisans also managed to recapture the deserter Skorzeny had interrogated . As a result of these early indicators of an attack , Tito 's main headquarters was relocated to another cave near the village of Bastasi , 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) west of Drvar . Tito then used the Drvar cave during the day , but returned to the Bastasi cave at night . In addition to this precaution , elements of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division were moved closer to Drvar . 
 On 23 May 1944 , a single German Fieseler Fi 156 reconnaissance aircraft flew a number of parallel runs up and down the Una valley over Drvar at around 600 metres ( 2 @,@ 000 ft ) ; activity consistent with conducting aerial photography . The aircraft paid particular attention to the villages of <unk> and <unk> Brijeg where the British military mission and American military personnel were located . This was observed by Street , the acting commander of the British military mission , who assumed it was spotting for a bombing raid and advised both Tito and the Americans . Both Allied missions moved their locations as a result . 
 Despite the intelligence received and observations made by the British , the Partisans appear to have been quite complacent about the threat , with Tito 's chief of staff , <unk> Jovanović swearing that " a German attack was impossible " . The most obvious indicator that Tito was unaware of the imminent attack is that he remained at the Drvar cave overnight on the evening of 24 May 1944 , following his birthday celebrations , instead of returning to Bastasi . 
 Through Ultra intercepts of German signal traffic , the British had become aware that the Germans were planning an operation codenamed " Rösselsprung " but the information available did not include where the operation would occur or what its objectives might be . 
 = = Planning = = 
 Following intelligence collection , higher level planning for the operation began on 6 May 1944 , after von Weichs had issued his orders . Hitler gave his approval to von Weichs ' final plans on 21 May . The order to XV Mountain Corps was issued by Generaloberst Lothar Rendulic , the commander of 2nd Panzer Army , on the same day , leaving only three days for preparation . General der Infanterie Ernst von Leyser , commander of XV Mountain Corps headquartered at Knin , was responsible for the conduct of the operation . The ground forces of von Leyser 's XV Mountain Corps were significantly reinforced from Army Group F , the 2nd Panzer Army and V SS Mountain Corps reserves . These reinforcements included two panzer companies , the reconnaissance battalions of the 1st Mountain Division ( the 54th Mountain Reconnaissance Battalion ) and the 369th ( Croatian ) Infantry Division , and most of 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen . 
 In outline , the XV Mountain Corps plan was for a heavy aerial bombardment of Partisan positions in and around Drvar by Luftwaffe aircraft , followed by a parachute and glider assault by the 500th SS Parachute Battalion who had the task of capturing or killing Tito and destroying his headquarters . The assault also included tasks to capture or destroy the Allied military missions to the Partisans . On the same day , ground elements of XV Mountain Corps were to converge on Drvar to link up with the 500th SS Parachute Battalion . A small reconnaissance aircraft was tasked to fly into Drvar after its capture to retrieve Tito or his body . 
 = = = 500th SS Parachute Battalion = = = 
 Rybka received an outline of the operation on 20 May , and more details the following day . He realised that the gliders and transport aircraft would be insufficient for the whole of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion to be delivered to Drvar in one lift , so he came up with a plan involving two waves . The first wave of 654 troops would conduct the assault at 07 : 00 and a second wave of 220 troops would follow about five hours later . Critically , the intelligence he was given regarding the suspected location of Tito 's headquarters ( codenamed " Citadel " ) was that it was in or near a cemetery on high ground southwest of the centre of Drvar , nearly 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) from Tito 's actual headquarters cave . This would have far @-@ reaching effects on the planning and execution of the assault . 
 Rybka 's plan for the first wave called for the insertion of 314 parachute troops in three groups ( Red , Green and Blue ) to secure the town , and another 354 troops in six glider @-@ borne assault groups to carry out specific tasks . The glider @-@ borne group tasks were : 
 Panther Group ( 110 soldiers ) – capture " Citadel " and destroy Tito 's headquarters – to land at the cemetery 
 Greifer ( Attacker ) Group ( 40 soldiers ) – destroy the British military mission in the village of Prnjavor 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) south of Drvar on the road to Bosansko Grahovo 
 Stürmer ( Stormer ) Group ( 50 soldiers ) – destroy the Soviet military mission between the centre of Drvar and the Unac river 
 Brecher ( Breaker ) Group ( 50 soldiers ) – destroy the American military mission in the village of <unk> Brijeg 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) south of the centre of Drvar 
 Draufgänger ( Daredevil ) Group ( 70 soldiers including members of the Brandenburg Division , the Abwehr officer Lieutenant Zavadil and some Chetniks ) – capture the crossroads ( codenamed " Western Cross " ) immediately to the west of Drvar including a nearby suspected communications facility 
 <unk> ( Biter ) Group ( 20 soldiers ) – seize an outpost radio station to the south of Prnjavor then assist the Greifer Group 
 The second wave of 220 troops based on the training company of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion were to insert by parachute at midday . 
 Rybka does not appear to have planned for any significant contingencies such as errors in the intelligence on the location of Tito 's headquarters . His only contingency plan was that he would fire a red signal flare to order all available forces to converge on his position for subsequent tasks . 
 On 22 May 1944 , the 500th SS Parachute Battalion were transported to airfields at Nagy @-@ <unk> , Zagreb and Banja Luka , dressed in Wehrmacht uniforms for security reasons . However , the troops were not briefed on the operation until a few hours before it was launched . They then linked up with their transport aircraft , including the ten @-@ man gliders that would deliver the glider @-@ borne troops onto their objectives . By 24 May , all preparations for the airborne assault were complete . 
 = = = Ground forces = = = 
 The plan for the ground forces of von Leyser 's XV Mountain Corps was for nine separate but coordinated thrusts toward the Drvar – Bosanski Petrovac area from all directions . The groupings and tasks were : 
 The 384th Infantry Regiment of the 373rd ( Croatian ) Infantry Division ( Croatian legionnaires ) , with elements of the 2nd Company of the 202nd Panzer Battalion , referred to as Kampfgruppe Willam after its commander , Oberst Willam , was to advance east at 05 : 00 from the village of Srb toward Drvar . Kampfgruppe Willam had the primary responsibility for relieving then taking command of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion in Drvar on 25 May , and was then to attack in the direction of Bosanski Petrovac . 
 A battalion group of the 373rd ( Croatian ) Infantry Division was to set out at 05 : 00 from Lapac and drive east through Kulen Vakuf to capture the crossroads at Vrtoče . If necessary , they were then to advance northwest toward Bihać to open the road . 
 The 92nd Motorised Regiment , with the 54th Reconnaissance Battalion ( from the 1st Mountain Division ) , the 55th Pioneer Battalion ( from the 1st Cossack Division ) , the 468th Armoured Car Company , and a regimental group of the 2nd Croatian Light Infantry Brigade was to advance southeast from Bihać and Bosanska Krupa at 05 : 00 through the village of Vrtoče to capture Bosanski Petrovac as quickly as possible , destroy the Partisans in that location , and occupy the Partisan airfield and supply installations . After capturing Bosanski Petrovac , elements were to be sent toward Drvar to prevent the withdrawal of Partisans along that road and to link up with the 500th SS Parachute Battalion in Drvar . 
 A regimental group of the 7th SS Division was to advance west from the area of Mrkonjić Grad , break through Partisan resistance east of the Sana and then advance on a wide front to block escape routes east out of Drvar . Part of this group was to advance from Jajce along the rail line and roads through <unk> to reach their objective , the area around <unk> power station . 
 An ad @-@ hoc Kampfgruppe Panzergrenadier Sturmbattalion manned by officer cadets , with 1st Company of the 202nd Panzer Battalion , under the command of the 7th SS Division , was to advance from Banja Luka toward Ključ to seize the crossing point across the Sana utilised by the Partisans . 
 The 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion with an additional panzer company was to advance from Livno and occupy any Partisan supply installations in the Livno Valley , and prevent any Partisan withdrawal to the south of Drvar by attacking through Bosanski Grahovo toward Drvar . 
 The 369th Reconnaissance Battalion of the 369th ( Croatian ) Infantry Division ( Croatian legionnaires ) , under the command of the 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion , were to advance from Livno up the Glamoč Valley against Partisan forces withdrawing from Drvar to the southeast . 
 The 1st Regiment of the Brandenburg Division , along with the Chetnik Dinara Division , were to advance from Knin toward Bosanski Grahovo and conduct special operations against Partisans in the Prekaja @-@ Drvar area . 
 = = Operation = = 
 The offensive began at 05 : 00 with the advance of ground forces from their assembly areas surrounding their assigned operational areas . About 06 : 35 , five squadrons of Luftwaffe bombers , including Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers , began bombing targets within Drvar and Bosanski Petrovac . A total of 440 sorties were flown on 25 May 1944 . 
 = = = Airborne assault and initial response = = = 
 The 500th SS Parachute Battalion began to parachute and glide onto their objectives at 07 : 00 , with most parachutists and glider pilots able to land relatively close to their targets despite the smoke and dust from the bombing . Some gliders landed significantly off course , including one that landed in front of the Bastasi cave 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) to the west of Drvar , and several that landed in a locality named Vrtoče near Drvar ( not to be confused with Vrtoče between Bihać and Petrovac , which was on the axis of advance of the 92nd Motorised Regiment ) . The occupants of the glider that landed in Bastasi were immediately killed by members of the Tito Escort Battalion guarding the cave , and the occupants of the gliders at Vrtoče had to fight their way toward Drvar . After landing , the first wave of the 500th SS Parachute Battalion quickly gained control of Drvar . 
 Panther Group supported by Red Group overcame minimal resistance at the cemetery and Rybka established his headquarters behind the cemetery walls . However , there was no sign of Tito or his headquarters . Greifer Group and Brecher Group were also unsuccessful as the British and American groups had moved following the aerial reconnaissance on 23 May . Parts of Stürmer Group landed their gliders in a field immediately south of the Drvar cave and came under fire from members of the Tito Escort Battalion on the high ground in the area of the cave . The Draufgänger Group landed their gliders at the " Western Cross " , then assaulted a building they believed was the Partisan communications centre . However , the building was actually the office of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia Central Committee , who resisted fanatically until the building was levelled using satchel charges . Both Blue Group and Green Group , consisting of parachute troops that landed in the eastern part of Drvar where most of the population lived , were also engaged in heavy fighting . The Young Communist League of Yugoslavia had just finished a conference in Drvar , and many of the delegates were still staying in the town . Many youths took up whatever arms they could obtain and commenced fighting the parachutists who were attempting to establish a cordon on the eastern side of the town . 
 About 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) further east on the road to <unk> was a Partisan officer training school with about 130 students . On hearing the fighting from the direction of Drvar , the students marched west initially armed with only pistols and a few rifles . They split into two groups , a smaller group which crossed the Unac and advanced west along the railway line on the ridge leading toward Tito 's cave , and a larger group which collected arms and ammunition from several stray canisters of German equipment dropped by parachute . The larger group of students attacked Green and Blue Groups from the east around 08 : 00 , suffering severe casualties , but maintained continuous pressure on the German flank . About 09 : 00 , the Germans had largely secured Drvar , and the available troops went from house to house , armed with photographs of Tito , brutally questioning the civilians they could find . Soon after this commenced , Rybka realised that Partisan resistance was concentrated to the north in the vicinity of the cave . He therefore fired the red signal flare to rally his troops for an assault in that direction . 
 = = = Assault on Tito 's cave and the Partisan counterattack = = = 
 At about 10 : 30 , Rybka launched a frontal attack across the Unac supported by at least one MG42 machine gun firing into the mouth of the cave . The Germans reached the base of the hill , fifty metres from the cave , but suffered severe casualties in the assault . They were also running low on water . Prior to this attack , Tito and around 20 staff had taken refuge in the cave . 
 While Rybka was assembling his troops for this attack , surrounding Partisan forces were rushed toward Drvar . Three battalions of the 3rd Lika Proletarian Brigade of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division approached from the southeast . One battalion attacked the German position at the cemetery while the other two swung around to strike the Germans from the west . 
 = = = Tito makes his escape = = = 
 At about 11 : 15 , after Rybka 's first attack had been defeated , Tito and the small group gathered with him escaped from the cave . There was a platform at the mouth of the cave , and they climbed down a rope through a trapdoor in the platform , although the hysteria displayed by Tito 's mistress <unk> <unk> ( codenamed " Zdenka " ) and his dog Tigar caused some delays . The party split up and following a creek leading to the Unac , the small groups climbed the heights to the east and withdrew toward the village of Potoci . 
 = = = Second German attack and withdrawal = = = 
 The second wave of parachute troops were dropped in two groups to the west of the cemetery at about midday . The drop zone was within fields of fire of the Partisans to the west of Drvar , and they suffered many casualties during the drop . Collecting the remainder , Rybka mounted a second attack , but the pressure on his flanks was too heavy , and the assault again failed . Fighting continued throughout the afternoon with both sides taking heavy casualties . 
 In the late afternoon , Rybka ordered his forces to withdraw to the area of the cemetery where he formed a defensive perimeter . During the withdrawal , at least one group of troops was cut off and killed . At about 18 : 00 , Rybka was wounded by a grenade blast and was later evacuated with other casualties in the light aircraft intended to carry away Tito after his capture . Roughly at the same time , his Partisan counterpart in Drvar , Milan <unk> , the commander of the 3rd Lika Proletarian Brigade , was also wounded by German machine gun fire . By 21 : 30 , the Germans had consolidated their position in the cemetery , although they were completely surrounded by the Partisans . During the night , the 3rd Lika Proletarian Brigade attacked the cemetery , with the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Brigade of the 9th Dalmatian Division reinforcing the assault . At 03 : 30 on 26 May , the final Partisan attack was launched against the cemetery , breaching the walls in several places , but the paratroopers held on . 
 = = = Ground force assault and Partisan withdrawal = = = 
 Although its total strength was estimated at 185 @,@ 500 men in late May 1944 , the 2nd Panzer Army was not able to rally more than 16 @,@ 000 troops for Operation Rösselsprung due to ever @-@ increasing Partisan activity throughout the country . The Germans had to rely on special forces and improved tactics . The Partisans defended the territory they controlled with significant demolition and mining of roads . Roadblocks were manned by patrols and smaller detachments , whose task was to hold off the enemy until reinforcements arrived . During Operation Rösselsprung , the Germans rendered these tactics ineffective by combining strong and fast motorised columns with adequate pioneer support . This combination was especially successful for the column led by the 92nd Motorised Regiment . The second German tactical innovation was the employment of five reconnaissance battalions for independent operations deep inside Partisan @-@ controlled territory . 
 = = = = 25 May = = = = 
 Throughout 25 May , the ground forces of XV Mountain Corps were not able to advance as quickly as planned . There was unexpected resistance from the Partisan 1st , 5th and 8th Corps along their axes of advance , and there was very poor communication and coordination between the various columns . The ground forces were also subjected to Allied air attacks throughout the day . 
 At 05 : 00 on 25 May , Kampfgruppe Willam commenced its attack from Srb in an easterly direction , aiming to cover the 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) to Drvar as quickly as possible . It encountered organised resistance from the 2nd Lika Proletarian Brigade of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division . After a day 's fighting , the Germans had captured <unk> , but were unable to overcome the defences of the hills east of the village . Recognising the importance of Kampfgruppe Willam 's task , the commander of the <unk> Division , Generalleutnant Eduard Aldrian , ordered the battalion group of the <unk> Division to abandon its advance from Lapac to Martin Brod and reinforce Kampfgruppe Willam instead . The remaining brigade of the 6th Lika Proletarian Division , the 1st Lika Proletarian Shock Brigade , was deployed to the north along the Una river . The 2nd Lika Proletarian Brigade requested assistance from the 1st Lika Proletarian Shock Brigade , but divisional headquarters ordered it to send reinforcements to Drvar instead . At 21 : 00 , the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Lika Proletarian Brigade launched a successful local counterattack on the vanguard of Kampfgruppe Willam , separating it from the main body . Willam then decided to halt the advance and place the remaining units into all @-@ round defence . At 22 : 25 , Aldrian ordered him to resume the attack , but Willam reported that this was impossible due to loss of contact with his own units . 
 The 92nd Motorised Regiment kampfgruppe consisted of two columns , a western column based on the 92nd Motorised Regiment , and an eastern column consisting of the 54th Reconnaissance Battalion and 1st Home Guard Jäger Regiment of the 2nd Croatian Light Infantry Brigade . The western column advanced southeast from Bihać , and encountered resistance from the 6th Krajina Brigade of the 4th Krajina Division . By the end of the day , the western column had reached Vrtoče , halfway between Bihać and Petrovac . Being fully motorised , it used its mobility to outmanoeuvre the Partisans , bypassing their main defensive positions to the west , with the Cossack pioneers playing an important role in keeping the column moving . The eastern column started its advance from Bosanska Krupa , aiming to establish contact with the western column at Vrtoče . It advanced 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) before being held up by the defences of the 8th Krajina Brigade of the 4th Krajina Division . 
 The forces commanded by the 7th SS Division were organised into northern , central and southern columns . The northern column consisted of Kampfgruppe Panzergrenadier Sturmbattalion and included a company of tanks . It moved swiftly southwest from its start point near Banja Luka , and had reached Čađavica ( at a crossroads halfway between Mrkonjić Grad and Ključ ) by the evening of 25 May , brushing off the 16th Krajina Brigade of the 39th Krajina Division deployed on the right flank of its axis of advance . The rapid advance meant that the 13th Krajina Brigade of the 39th Krajina Division was unable to organise an effective defence . The 39th Krajina Division then ordered the 13th Krajina Brigade to block the road from Čađavica to Ključ in order to prevent the loss of Ključ , but only one battalion of the brigade managed to reach that position by dawn on 26 May . 
 The central column consisted of the 7th SS Reconnaissance Battalion reinforced with one battery of self @-@ propelled guns , which had a special task : it was to strike from Mrkonjić Grad , penetrate deeply into Partisans ’ rear and destroy the HQ of the 5th Partisan Corps in Ribnik . Despite having only two battalions in the area ( the third was facing Kampfgruppe Panzergrenadier Sturmbattalion at Čađavica ) , the 13th Proletarian Brigade managed to hold off this thrust . The southern column was based on the 13th SS Mountain Regiment , reinforced by I Battalion of the 7th SS Mountain Artillery Regiment and some Chetniks . This column launched its assault from the Jajce area , and had the task of reaching <unk> ( 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) south of Ključ ) . By 17 : 20 , II Battalion of the 13th SS Mountain Regiment had taken Šipovo , but any further advance was halted by the defences of the 1st Proletarian Brigade . 
 The Germans deployed two columns to attack north from Livno . The 369th Reconnaissance Battalion with some 200 men from the 6th Ustaša Brigade advanced towards Glamoč , and the 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion with a panzer company thrust in the direction of Bosansko Grahovo . By 16 : 00 on 25 May 1944 , the 369th Reconnaissance Battalion column had reached the village of Han @-@ <unk> , some 5 km from Bosansko Grahovo . At that point , it was attacked by the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Krajina Brigade and was forced to retreat . During the retreat , this column was attacked by two more battalions of the 3rd Krajina Brigade and was pushed back all the way to its start line at Livno with heavy losses . A preliminary German report estimated their losses at 50 , but the 3rd Krajina Brigade estimated German losses at 191 dead and wounded . The 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion column overcame the resistance of local Partisan units and the 1st and 4th Battalions of the 13th Dalmatian Brigade , and by the end of the day had reached <unk> Lug , some 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) from Bosansko Grahovo . In the evening , the 13th Dalmatian Brigade was ordered to march towards <unk> and Drvar to reinforce the Partisan forces in that area . 
 The 1st Regiment of the Brandenburg Division , reinforced by a pioneer company from the 373rd ( Croatian ) Infantry Division and the Chetnik Dinara Division , attacked along the Knin – Bosansko Grahovo axis , pushed back the local Grahovo – <unk> Partisan Detachment and by the end of the day had reached positions some 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) beyond Strmica . 
 Escorted by elements of the 3rd Krajina Brigade , Tito made his way to Potoci , where he was met by a battalion of the 1st Proletarian Brigade . At Potoci , they were met by the staff of the Allied military missions . The British mission signals officer had brought the only surviving radio . Initially , Tito had been in favour of continuing the attack on the SS paratroopers , but after reassessing the situation , he cancelled further attacks . As the German intention to encircle the Supreme Command in a small area around Drvar with approaching units , and then destroy it with land forces had become apparent by now , serious reorganisation of Partisan dispositions was now required . After German troops were observed in the area of Potoci , Tito and his companions were escorted towards Kupres . 
 The 2nd Panzer Army was monitoring the operation closely . The report of a special troop , which had been sent into the Partisans ’ rear with the help of disguised Chetniks several days earlier , drew particular attention from Rendulic . According to this report , received late on 25 May , Tito was in the area of Potoci , halfway between Drvar and Ribnik . Rendulic ordered the commander of the 7th SS Division to immediately form a special company @-@ strong detachment , with a mission to infiltrate behind the Partisan lines in order to kill Tito and destroy the Partisan Supreme Command . The detachment was formed on the night of 25 / 26 May from the 11th Company of the 13th SS Regiment , a number of pioneers , and a group of specially trained personnel from the Brandenburg Division . As the detachment failed to penetrate into the Partisan territory that night , it tried again the following night . 
 = = = = 26 – 27 May = = = = 
 At about 05 : 00 on 26 May , a Luftwaffe fighter @-@ bomber formation engaged the Partisan troops withdrawing from Drvar . The western column of the 92nd Motorised Regiment kampfgruppe was ordered to help assist the eastern column by detaching a reinforced Panzer company from Vrtoče . 
 On the morning of 26 May , the German columns advancing from Bihać towards Ključ , and from Livno and Knin towards Bosansko Grahovo , overcame the Partisan units in their paths , and continued their advance facing little resistance . The 92nd Motorised Grenadier Regiment , advancing from Vrtoče , took Bosanski Petrovac without a fight about 8 : 00 . It continued its march to Drvar and relieved the 500th SS Parachute Battalion at 12 : 45 . Kampfgruppe Willam established radio contact with the 500th SS Battalion around 07 : 00 , and at 17 : 00 entered Drvar via Kamenica . The 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion arrived at Bosansko Grahovo at 10 : 30 , where it was joined by the 1st Regiment of the Brandenburg Division at 16 : 00 . Kampfgruppe Panzergrenadier Sturmbattalion entered Ključ at 14 : 15 . 
 In the eastern sector , the Partisan line of defence was still holding . During 26 and 27 May , the 7th SS Division continued exerting strong pressure on the 1st Proletarian Division in the upper Sana River Valley , but failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough . By the end of 27 May , the front line had stabilised to the north and south of Ribnik . After the defeat it had suffered the previous day , the 369th Reconnaissance Battalion column did not resume its advance towards Glamoč on the 26th . 
 On 26 May , due to the rapidly changing situation and communications difficulties , a degree of confusion emerged on both sides . Out of contact with their corps headquarters , the 4th Krajina Division continued to retain two brigades along the Bihać @-@ Petrovac road , despite the fact that the 92nd Motorised Regiment had already passed along this route and into their rear . The critically important Petrovac @-@ Ključ road to the south was left unguarded , endangering Tito and Supreme Partisan Headquarters as they fled from Drvar . 
 XV Mountain Corps failed to recognise and exploit these flaws in Partisan deployments . After the 500th Parachute Battalion had been relieved , the XV Mountain Corps ordered the units in the Drvar area to disperse . The 92nd Motorised Regiment with all subordinated units was ordered to return north and attack the brigades of the 4th Krajina Division on the Grmeč Mountain , with the aim of securing the main supply road from Bihać to Petrovac ; this action , codenamed " Grmeč " , was scheduled to start on the morning of 27 May . The 373rd Division with the newly subordinated 1st Regiment of the Brandenburg Division was ordered to conduct a sweep @-@ and @-@ destroy operation in the area south and southeast of Drvar ; this operation was codenamed " Vijenac " , and was to take place concurrently with “ Operation Grmeč ” . The 9th Dalmatian Division managed to repulse all attacks on 27 May , pushing the Brandenburgers and Chetniks back to Bosansko Grahovo . On 27 May , the 369th Reconnaissance Battalion column again tried to advance on Glamoč , but with no success . 
 Unhappy with the development of the operation to this point , Rendulic cancelled Operations " Grmeč " and " Vijenac " on the afternoon of 27 May , and ordered von Leyser to move all units back to their start positions for a concentric attack on the area where Tito and two Partisan corps headquarters ( 1st Proletarian and 5th Bosnian ) were believed to be located . The attack was scheduled to begin on the morning of 28 May . Rendulic also sent the 105th SS Reconnaissance Battalion to the Livno @-@ Glamoč area which had been left wide open by the defeat of the 369th Reconnaissance Battalion thrust . 
 Tito , his staff and his escort continued toward Kupres , travelling on foot and by horseback , as well as on the wagons of a narrow @-@ gauge logging railway . During this trek , one of the members of the Soviet mission was wounded by shellfire . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 During their escape , the British mission were able to make contact with their headquarters using the surviving radio . They were able to maintain contact and called in an air offensive against the German formations taking part in Operation Rösselsprung and the Luftwaffe aircraft in the skies over Yugoslavia . This offensive included over one thousand sorties by the newly formed Balkan Air Force . A costly ground attack was also launched by a combined Partisan , British and US force on the German @-@ held Dalmatian island of Brač . Code @-@ named " Operation <unk> " , the assault was mounted from the British @-@ held island of Vis further out in the Adriatic Sea on the night of 1 / 2 June . Fighting continued late into 3 June 1944 and resulted in the reinforcement of the island by a further 1 @,@ 900 German troops . The assault force on Brač consisted of 13 battalions from the 26th Dalmatian Division , the British 43 ( Royal Marines ) Commando , one troop from 40 ( Royal Marines ) Commando , and an American mountain company , with one howitzer battery and two mountain batteries providing artillery support . After three days of fighting , the combined forces returned to Vis . The Partisans suffered losses of 67 dead , 308 wounded and 14 missing , and Allied units suffered 60 dead , 74 wounded and 20 missing , with the commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Jack Churchill , being captured by the Germans . 
 After six days evading the Germans , the leader of the Soviet mission , Lieutenant General Nikolai <unk> <unk> , who had lost a leg in the Battle of Stalingrad , suggested an air evacuation of Tito and the Soviet mission and this was expanded by Street to include the whole party . After three days deliberation , Tito agreed on 3 June and Street arranged the evacuation the same night from an RAF @-@ operated airfield near the town of Kupres . Seven Douglas C @-@ 47 Skytrain aircraft , one with a Soviet crew and the remainder with US crew , carried Tito and his party , the Allied missions and 118 wounded Partisans to Bari in Italy . Late on 6 June , Tito was delivered by the Royal Navy escort destroyer HMS Blackmore to Vis , where he re @-@ established his headquarters and was joined by the Allied missions . The Soviet Foreign Minister , Vyacheslav Molotov , believed that the British had known more about the attack than they claimed , based on the absence of both Maclean and Churchill from Drvar at the time of the attack . On 28 May , he sent a message to <unk> detailing his suspicions . 
 Although Tito 's headquarters , along with several other Partisan organisations , was temporarily disrupted and key staff were lost during the operation , all Partisan organisations were quickly re @-@ located and resumed operation . Drvar reverted to Partisan control within a few weeks of the operation . The operation was a failure , as Tito , his principal headquarters staff and the allied military personnel escaped , despite their presence in Drvar at the time of the airborne assault . The operation failed due to a number of factors , including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar . The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito 's exact location also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans , and this failure to share intelligence was compounded by a lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force . 
 The 500th SS Parachute Battalion was decimated during Operation Rösselsprung , suffering 576 killed and 48 wounded . Only 200 soldiers of the battalion were fit to fight on the morning of 26 May . It continued throughout the rest of the war as the only SS parachute unit , although its name was later changed to the 600th SS Parachute Battalion . Operation Rösselsprung was its only combat parachute operation . 
 According to a German report , the ground troops of XV Mountain Corps suffered 213 killed , 881 wounded , and 51 missing during Operation Rösselsprung . The same report claimed that 6 @,@ 000 Partisans were killed . According to the commander of the 7th SS Division , SS @-@ Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen @-@ SS Otto Kumm , Partisan losses included 1 @,@ 916 confirmed and another 1 @,@ 400 estimated killed , and 161 taken prisoner . Kumm also claimed that six Allied aircraft were shot down during the operation . According to a Partisan source , their total losses were 399 killed , 479 wounded , and at least 85 missing . Of this total , the casualties suffered in fighting with the 500th SS Parachute Battalion at Drvar numbered 179 killed , 63 wounded , and 19 missing . Ultimately , according to intelligence historian Ralph Bennett , " The long @-@ term significance of the Drvar raid was simply that it failed . "

 The Light Tank ( Airborne ) M22 or Locust was an American @-@ designed airmobile light tank which was produced during World War II . The Locust began development in 1941 after the British War Office requested that the American government design a purpose @-@ built airborne light tank which could be transported by glider into battle to support British airborne forces . The War Office had originally selected the Light Tank Mark VII Tetrarch light tank for use by the airborne forces , but it had not been designed with that exact purpose in mind so the War Office believed that a purpose @-@ built tank would be required to replace it . The United States Ordnance Department was asked to produce this replacement , which in turn selected Marmon @-@ Herrington to design and build a prototype airborne tank in May 1941 . The prototype was designated the Light Tank T9 ( Airborne ) , and was designed so that it could be transported underneath a Douglas C @-@ 54 Skymaster transport aircraft , although its dimensions also allowed it to fit inside a General Aircraft Hamilcar glider . 
 After a series of modifications were made to the initial prototype , production of the T9 began in April 1943 . It was significantly delayed , however , when several faults were found with the tank 's design . Marmon @-@ Herrington only began to produce significant numbers of the T9 in late 1943 and early 1944 , and by then the design was considered to be obsolete ; only 830 were built by the time production ended in February 1945 . As a result , the Ordnance Department gave the tank the specification number M22 but no combat units were equipped with it . However , the War Office believed that the tank would perform adequately despite its faults , so the tank was given the title of " Locust " and 260 were shipped to Great Britain under the Lend @-@ Lease Act . Seventeen Locusts were received by the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment in late 1943 , but mechanical problems led to the tanks being withdrawn in favour of the Tetrarchs previously used by the regiment . 
 In October 1944 however , the remaining Tetrarchs of the regiment were replaced by Locusts and eight were used during Operation Varsity in March 1945 . The tanks did not perform well in action ; several were damaged during the landing process and one was knocked out by a German self @-@ propelled gun . Only two Locusts were able to reach their planned rendezvous point and go into action , occupying a piece of high ground along with an infantry company . The tanks were forced to withdraw from the position after several hours however , because they attracted artillery fire that caused the infantry to suffer heavy casualties . The Locust never saw active service with the British Army again and was classified as obsolete in 1946 . A number of Locusts were used by foreign militaries in the post @-@ war period however ; the Belgian Army used Locusts as command tanks for their M4 Sherman tank regiments , and the Egyptian Army used several company @-@ sized units of Locusts during the 1948 Arab – Israeli War .

 = = = Background = = = 
 The Light Tank ( Airborne ) M22 , also known as the Locust , began development in late 1941 in response to a request by the British military earlier in the year for an airmobile light tank which could be transported onto a battlefield by glider . At the time the request was made , the War Office considered using the equipment in Britain 's fledgling airborne forces , which had been formed in June 1940 by order of the Prime Minister , Winston Churchill . When officials at the War Office examined the equipment that would be required for a British airborne division , they decided that gliders would be an integral component of such a force . These gliders would be used to transport troops and heavy equipment , which by 1941 was to include artillery and some form of tank . Plans to transport an airborne tank went through a number of revisions , but by May 1941 it was considered feasible for a tank weighing 5 @.@ 4 long tons ( 5 @.@ 5 t ) to be carried for 300 to 350 mi ( 480 to 560 km ) in a glider , although the latter would have to be specifically designed for the task . In a conference held on January 16 , 1941 , it was decided that the General Aircraft Hamilcar , under development at the time , would be used to transport a single tank or two Universal Carriers . 
 A decision had recently been made by the War Office that light tanks were no longer to be generally used in the British Army ; on the whole they had performed poorly during the Battle of France and were considered to be a liability . As a result , the Vickers @-@ Armstrong Light Tank Mk VII Tetrarch light tank was now considered obsolete . This made it available for use by the airborne forces and it was chosen by the War Office as the tank to be transported by glider . However , it had not been designed specifically as an airborne tank or to be airmobile , and it also possessed several faults . Its size limited the possible crew to three — a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret — which was found to be too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively . The gunner or commander , in addition to his own duties , had to act as loader for the 2 @-@ pounder , which caused delays in combat ; a report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that since the commander had both to fight and control the tank , controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible . The War Office was also aware that the tank had a faulty cooling system that made the Tetrarch unsuitable for service in hotter climates , such as the Middle East and North Africa . 
 A purpose @-@ built airborne light tank was therefore required to replace the Tetrarch , but the decision was taken by the War Office not to produce the tank in Britain due to a lack of production capacity . Instead the American government was approached with a request that it produce a replacement for the Tetrarch . This request was made by the British Air Commission in Washington , D.C. , with a proposal calling for a tank of between 9 t ( 8 @.@ 9 long tons ) and 10 t ( 9 @.@ 8 long tons ) to be developed , this being the maximum weight the War Office had decided could be carried by current glider technology . The proposed tank was to have a primary armament of a 37 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) main gun and secondary armament of a .30 @-@ 06 Browning <unk> , and a crew of three . The specification also called for a maximum speed of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) and an operational radius of 200 miles ( 320 km ) . The turret and front of the hull were to have an armour thickness of between 40 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) and 50 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) , and the sides of the tank a thickness of 30 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) . The United States Ordnance Department was given the task of developing the proposed tank , and in turn requested designs from three American companies : General Motors , J. Walter Christie and Marmon @-@ Herrington . The design offered by Christie in mid @-@ 1941 was rejected as it failed to meet the specified size requirements , as was a modified design the company produced in November . At a conference in May 1941 , the Ordnance Department chose the Marmon @-@ Herrington design and requested that the company produce a prototype tank , which was completed in late 1941 ; it was designated the Light Tank T9 ( Airborne ) by the company and the Ordnance Department . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 The T9 had a crew of three and weighed 6 @.@ 7 metric tons ( 7 @.@ 4 short tons ) . It was armed with a 37 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) main gun and a coaxial .30 @-@ 06 Browning <unk> machine @-@ gun , as well as two further machine @-@ guns on the right @-@ hand side of the bow . The main gun and coaxial machine @-@ gun were mounted in a powered turret , which also had a gun stabilizer installed to allow the gun to be fired when the tank was moving . The T9 was powered by a 162 horse @-@ power six @-@ cylinder , air @-@ cooled Lycoming engine , and the thickness of the armour varied ; the front , rear and sides of the hull had a thickness of 12 @.@ 5 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 49 in ) while the sloped portions of the hull had a thickness of 9 @.@ 5 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 37 in ) . The tank 's engine was able to give it a maximum speed of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) . The T9 was not primarily designed to be transported by glider , a significant change from the original request , but instead was to be carried under the belly of a Douglas C @-@ 54 Skymaster transport aircraft , using four lifting brackets welded onto each side of the hull of the tank . The turret was designed to be removable so that it could be detached and transported inside the C @-@ 54 and reattached once on the battlefield . The loading took six men about twenty @-@ five minutes , the unloading ten minutes . On top of this the aircraft required a proper airfield on which to land . However , the T9 was of the correct shape , weight and size to be carried inside a Hamilcar glider , suggesting that these dimensions had been chosen deliberately so that the tank could be transported inside a glider if required . 
 A number of changes were made to the prototype during testing . The main change was the addition of supporting steel beams to improve and strengthen the suspension of the tank , which increased the weight to 7 @.@ 05 metric tons ( 7 @.@ 77 short tons ) , the maximum weight that could be carried by a Hamilcar glider . Two new prototypes were ordered by the Ordnance Department in January 1942 and were delivered by Marmon @-@ Herrington in November 1942 . They were both designated T9E1 . The new tanks incorporated a number of requested changes . The turret was altered in shape ; it was lightened by the removal of the power traverse mechanism and the gyro stabilizer for the main armament . The front of the hull was altered from a stepped appearance to a more sloped profile , which would provide for a better ballistic shape ; the two .30 @-@ 06 machine @-@ guns were removed from the bow of the tank and the suspension was altered to try and reduce the weight of the design . However , contrary to normal practice , the Ordnance Department had placed an order for the original T9 design in April 1942 , before the T9E1 models were delivered in November 1942 ; 500 were ordered in April and this order rapidly increased to a total of 1900 , with deliveries to begin in November . However , production difficulties and design changes caused this date to be delayed several times , and it was not until April 1943 that production on the T9 actually began . 
 Production of the T9 peaked at 100 tanks produced per month between August 1943 and January 1944 ; however , this number rapidly declined when the results of the British and American testing programmes were reported to the Ordnance Department , and only 830 <unk> were ever produced . The faults discovered with the design led to the Ordnance Department giving it the specification number M22 , but classing it as ' limited standard ' . No American combat units were equipped with the tank , although some of those produced were used for training purposes and two experimental units were formed and equipped with Locusts . The 151st Airborne Tank Company was formed on 15 August 1943 , despite concerns that there would be insufficient transport aircraft to deliver the unit into battle , and the 28th Airborne Tank Battalion was also formed in December of the same year . However , neither unit saw combat , due to the US Army 's lack of interest in using them in an airborne capacity . The 151st Airborne Tank Company remained in the United States , shuttling from base to base throughout the war , and the 28th Airborne Tank Battalion was refitted with conventional tanks in October 1944 . Some 25 Locusts were ordered in April 1944 for use in the European Theater of Operations , and delivered by September ; although a small number were sent to the United States Sixth Army Group in Alsace , France , for testing , they were never used in combat . However , the British still required the M22 as a replacement for the Tetrarch and the first prototype Locust was shipped to Britain in May 1942 for testing , followed by the second prototype T9E1 in July 1943 . Although they were of the opinion that the M22 possessed a number of faults , the War Office believed it would perform adequately as an airborne tank . Thus the tank received the official title of " Locust " and 260 were shipped to Britain under the Lend @-@ Lease Act . The majority of the Locusts ended up placed in tank parks until they were scrapped at the end of the conflict , and only eight ever saw action with British airborne forces . 
 = = = Faults = = = 
 Extensive testing of the M22 occurred in 1943 and 1944 , and was conducted by both the Ordnance Department and the British Armoured Fighting Vehicle ( AFV ) Gunnery School at Lulworth Ranges . These tests uncovered a number of faults and problems with the Locust . The AFV School noted that the process of loading the M22 into a C @-@ 54 transport aircraft took considerable time and involved the use of complex equipment . Overall the process took six untrained men 24 minutes , although it was believed this could be shortened with sufficient training . Unloading was also a long process , taking approximately ten minutes ; it was noted that the time it took to unload the M22 from a C @-@ 54 on the battlefield meant that both the tank and aircraft would make excellent targets for enemy fire . Operational use of the tank would therefore be restricted to the availability of airfields large enough to accommodate a fully laden C @-@ 54 , which might not be in the right geographical location or might even have to be captured in advance of a planned airborne operation . A heavy transport aircraft , the Fairchild C @-@ 82 Packet , was developed to specifically carry the M22 inside its fuselage and unload it through a set of clam @-@ shell doors , but it did not enter service until after the war had ended . The US Army Armored Board released a critical report on the Locust in September 1943 , stating that it was inadequate in the areas of reliability and durability , and indicating that it would not be able to be successfully used during airborne operations . By 1944 it was also realized that the design of the tank was actually obsolete . The armor of the M22 in several areas was found to be so thin that it was incapable of even resisting the armor @-@ piercing ammunition of a .50 caliber machine @-@ gun . Complaints were also made about the 37mm main armament , which was not powerful enough to penetrate the armor of most tanks used by the Axis powers . Similarly a report made on March 13 , 1944 by elements of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment complained that when a high @-@ explosive shell was fired from the gun , the resulting shell @-@ burst was so weak that observers had difficulty in seeing where it impacted . There were also mechanical problems with the design , which caused it to be unreliable ; the engine was also found to be underpowered , possibly due to problems with the torque characteristics of the engine or an inefficient transmission system .

 By late 1941 , several new British units had been raised specifically trained to conduct airborne operations . The largest such unit was the newly formed 1st Airborne Division , and on 19 January 1942 the War Office took the decision that a light tank detachment would be amongst the support units attached to the division . Designated the Light Tank Squadron , this unit was to be formed of nineteen light tanks and would operate to the fore of the division , using their speed to capture objectives and hold them until relieved by other units . The unit chosen for conversion into the Light Tank Squadron was ' C ' Special Services Squadron , which had seen service as an independent tank unit during Operation Ironclad , the invasion of Madagascar in mid @-@ 1942 . The squadron was also equipped with Tetrarchs , which had recently been re @-@ designated as an airborne tank by the War Office . ' C ' Squadron was officially transferred to the 1st Airborne Division on 24 June 1942 , bringing with it seven Tetrarchs amongst the other vehicles it was equipped with . The unit immediately began training , but did not stay attached to the 1st Airborne Division for very long ; during mid @-@ 1943 , the division was transported to the Middle East , where it would eventually participate in Operation Husky , the Allied invasion of the island of Sicily . ' C ' Squadron remained in Britain however , as not enough Hamilcar gliders had yet been built to transport and deploy all of their Tetrarchs . 
 The squadron was transferred to the division with which it would spend the rest of the war ; the 6th Airborne Division , raised in April 1943 . The squadron continued to train as an air @-@ portable unit and participated in a number of exercises intended to familiarize it with the duties it would perform , including reconnaissance of enemy positions and performing counter @-@ attacks against enemy infantry and armor . In mid @-@ July an American pilot was sent to Britain to illustrate that the tank could fit inside a Hamilcar and be landed , and then on October 25 the Light Tank Squadron received a shipment of seventeen Locusts . During November the new tanks were issued to the squadron , replacing a majority of the Tetrarchs ; however a small number of Tetrarchs fitted with a 3 inch ( 76 @.@ 2 mm ) infantry support howitzer , which were designated as Tetrarch 1 CS ( Close Support ) , were retained . Several of the Locusts also were fitted with Littlejohn adaptors to increase the range and penetration power of their main armament , although it is not clear how many were fitted or if they were fitted at manufacture or after they reached the squadron . The squadron was expanded into the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment in December 1943 , and as late as March 1944 , plans were made for the regiment to be equipped with seventeen Locusts and three Tetrarchs when it took part in Operation Tonga , the British airborne landings in Normandy . However , records indicate that by April the Hamilcar gliders of the regiment were being refitted to only carry Tetrarchs , and by late March the Locusts appear to have been completely replaced . This seems to have been due to mechanical and gunnery problems with the Locusts , as well as specific problems with the design of the Locust 's gearbox . 
 The regiment took part in Operation Tonga as part of 6th Airlanding Brigade in June 1944 , equipped with twenty Tetrarchs . However , due to their thin armor and underpowered armament they proved to be completely outclassed by the tanks and self @-@ propelled guns deployed by German forces , such as the Panzer IV and the Sturmgeschütz III . By August , in preparation for the 6th Airborne Division 's participation in the planned breakout from the Normandy bridgehead , the majority of Tetrarchs in ' A ' Squadron were replaced with Cromwell fast cruiser tanks ; only three Tetrarchs were retained , remaining with the Headquarters troop of ' A ' Squadron . In September the division returned to Britain and in the first week of October 1944 , the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment underwent an extensive reorganization . The regiment was completely restructured and retired all the remaining Tetrarch tanks it was equipped with , replacing them with Locusts . 
 = = = = Operation Varsity = = = = 
 In March 1945 , the 6th Airborne Division was informed that it would be participating in Operation Varsity , an airborne operation in support of 21st Army Group crossing the River Rhine during Operation Plunder . On March 24 the division , in conjunction with the American United States 17th Airborne Division , would be dropped by parachute and glider near the city of Wesel , where it would capture the strategically important village of Hamminkeln , several important bridges over the River IJssel and the southern portion of a major forest , the Diersfordter Wald . Eight Locusts from the regiment , divided into two troops of four , would land with the 6th Airlanding Brigade in landing @-@ zone ' P ' east of the Diersfordter Wald and west of Hamminkeln , acting as a divisional reserve ; the rest of the regiment would arrive by road after crossing the Rhine with 21st Army Group . 
 The eight Locusts were loaded into separate Hamilcar gliders between 17 – 20 March , and on the morning of 24 March were towed from the airfield by Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers to join the rest of the gliders and transport aircraft carrying the two airborne divisions . Weather conditions for the operation were excellent , with clear visibility , and all eight gliders arrived in the vicinity of the landing zone without incident . During their attempts to land , however , the small force was severely depleted ; one glider broke away from the Halifax towing it and disintegrated , apparently as a result of structural failure , with the Locust inside it falling to the ground . Three more gliders came under heavy German anti @-@ aircraft fire and crashed as they landed ; one tank survived with a damaged machine gun , another crashed through a house which put its wireless radio set and main armament out of action , and the third broke loose of the glider as it landed and was flipped over onto its turret , rendering it useless . 
 Six Locusts landed intact on the landing zone , including several with significant damage , but two of these tanks would never reach the rendezvous point chosen for the regiment . One undamaged tank came to the aid of a group of American paratroopers who were under fire from a German self @-@ propelled gun but was rapidly knocked out by the German vehicle , wounding two crewmembers . A second tank broke down as it attempted to tow a jeep out of a crashed glider , although the crew remained with the tank and supported British airborne troops in the area . Of the four Locusts that reached the rendezvous point , only two were undamaged and fully fit for action ; these two were immediately deployed to the high ground east of the Diersfordter Wald , while being covered by the two damaged tanks . Upon arrival they were engaged by German troops and had to be supported by an infantry company , and soon their presence began attracting a great deal of artillery and anti @-@ tank fire . Although neither of the tanks were hit , a number of infantrymen were killed or wounded and after several hours the tanks were forced to withdraw . The four tanks and remaining infantry formed a small force that repelled several German attempts to attack their position , and were eventually relieved at 10 : 30 by a tank squadron from the 44th Royal Tank Regiment and elements of the rest of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment .

 Operation Varsity was the only time the Locust would see action with the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment or the British Army as a whole . A report issued at the end of a conference held by the Director ( Air ) of the War Office in January 1946 confirmed that the Locust design was considered obsolete ; any light tanks to be used in post @-@ war airborne formations would be made from completely new designs . The British Army disposed of a small number of Locusts by transferring them to foreign militaries . Several had their main armaments removed and were used by the Belgian Army as command tanks for their M4 Sherman regiments , and a few Locusts even found their way back to the U.S. , where they had their turrets removed and served as agricultural tractors . A larger number of Locusts served with the Egyptian Army , replacing a number of older tank models , such as the Vickers @-@ Armstrong Mark V light tank , that the Egyptian military had acquired during the interwar period . Several company @-@ sized units of Locusts were used by the Egyptians during the 1948 Arab – Israeli War .

 = Goldilocks and the Three Bears = 
 " Goldilocks and the Three Bears " and the older " The Story of the Three Bears " are two variations of an old fairy tale . The original tale tells of an ugly , old woman who enters the forest home of three bachelor bears whilst they are away . She sits in their chairs , eats some of their porridge , and falls asleep in one of their beds . When the bears return and discover her , she starts up , jumps from the window , and is never seen again . The other major version brings Goldilocks to the tale ( replacing the old woman ) , and an even later version retained Goldilocks , but has the three bachelor bears transformed into Papa , Mama , and Baby Bear . 
 What was originally a fearsome oral tale became a cosy family story with only a hint of menace . The story has elicited various interpretations and has been adapted to film , opera , and other media . " The Story of the Three Bears " is one of the most popular fairy tales in the English language .

 = = Origins = = 
 The story was first recorded in narrative form by British writer and poet Robert Southey , and first published anonymously in 1837 in a volume of his writings called The Doctor . The same year , British writer George Nicol published a version in rhyme based upon Southey 's prose tale , with Southey approving Nicol 's attempt to give the story more exposure . In 1849 , Joseph Cundall introduced a pretty little girl to the story and dispensed with the old woman . Cundall believed there were already too many tales with old women playing roles in the narrative . 
 The story of the three bears was in circulation before the publication of Southey 's tale . In 1813 , for example , Southey was telling the story to friends , and in 1831 Eleanor Mure fashioned a handmade booklet about the three bears and the old woman for her nephew 's birthday , In 1894 , " Scrapefoot " , a tale with a fox as antagonist that bears striking similarities to Southey 's story , was uncovered by the folklorist Joseph Jacobs and may predate Southey 's version in the oral tradition . Southey possibly heard " Scrapefoot " , and confused its " vixen " with a synonym for an unpleasant malicious old woman . Some maintain however that the story as well as the old woman originated with Southey . 
 " The Story of the Three Bears " experienced two significant changes during its early publication history . The intrusive little girl was given various names referring to her hair until Goldilocks was settled upon once and for all in the early 20th century . Southey 's three bachelor bears evolved into Papa , Mama , and Baby Bear over several years . 
 In 1837 , Robert Southey published " The Story of the Three Bears " in his collection of essays and miscellanea entitled The Doctor . The tale was not an original creation by Southey , but was a retelling of a story that had long been in circulation . Southey had been telling the story to others as early as September 1813 , and in 1831 Eleanor Mure versified the tale as a birthday gift for her nephew Horace Broke . 
 Southey and Mure differ in details . Southey 's bears have porridge , but Mure 's have milk ; Southey 's old woman has no motive for entering the house , but Mure 's old woman is piqued when her courtesy visit is rebuffed ; Southey 's old woman runs away when discovered , but Mure 's old woman is impaled on the steeple of St Paul 's Cathedral . 
 Southey most likely learned the tale as a child from his uncle William Tyler . Tyler may have told a version with a vixen ( she @-@ fox ) as intruder , and Southey later confused vixen with a common appellation for a crafty old woman . P.M. <unk> writes in " The Gothic Voice of Father Bear " ( 1974 ) that " It was no trick for Southey , a consummate technician , to recreate the improvisational tone of an Uncle William through rhythmical reiteration , artful alliteration ( ' they walked into the woods , while ' ) , even bardic interpolation ( ' She could not have been a good , honest Old Woman ' ) " . Ultimately , it is uncertain where Southey or his uncle learned the tale . 
 The same year Southey 's tale was published , the story was versified by George Nicol who acknowledged the anonymous author of The Doctor as " the great , original <unk> " of the tale . Southey was delighted with Nicol 's effort to bring more exposure to the tale , concerned children might overlook it in The Doctor . Nicol 's version was illustrated with engravings by B. Hart ( after " C.J. " ) , and was reissued in 1848 with Southey identified as the story 's author . 
 Folklorists Iona and Peter Opie point out in The Classic Fairy Tales ( 1999 ) that the tale has a " partial analogue " in " Snow White " : the lost princess enters the dwarfs ' house , tastes their food , and falls asleep in one of their beds . In a manner similar to the three bears , the dwarfs cry , " Someone 's been sitting in my chair ! " , " Someone 's been eating off my plate ! " , and " Someone 's been sleeping in my bed ! " The Opies also point to similarities in a Norwegian tale about a princess who takes refuge in a cave inhabited by three Russian princes dressed in bearskins . She eats their food and hides under a bed . 
 In 1865 , Charles Dickens referenced a similar tale in Our Mutual Friend , but in Our Mutual Friend , the house belongs to hobgoblins rather than bears . Dickens ' reference however suggests a yet to be discovered analogue or source . Hunting rituals and ceremonies have been suggested and dismissed as possible origins . 
 In 1894 , the illustrator John D. Batten reported a variant of the tale at least 40 years old . In this version , the three bears live in a castle in the woods and are visited by a fox called Scrapefoot who drinks their milk , sits in their chairs , and rests in their beds . This version belongs to the early Fox and Bear tale @-@ cycle .

 Twelve years after the publication of Southey 's tale , Joseph Cundall transformed the antagonist from an ugly old woman to a pretty little girl in his Treasury of Pleasure Books for Young Children . He explained his reasons for doing so in a dedicatory letter to his children , dated November 1849 , which was inserted at the beginning of the book : 
 The " Story of the Three Bears " is a very old Nursery Tale , but it was never so well told as by the great poet Southey , whose version I have ( with permission ) given you , only I have made the intruder a little girl instead of an old woman . This I did because I found that the tale is better known with Silver @-@ Hair , and because there are so many other stories of old women . 
 Once the little girl entered the tale , she remained – suggesting children prefer an attractive child in the story rather than an ugly old woman . The juvenile antagonist saw a succession of names : Silver Hair in the pantomime Harlequin and The Three Bears ; or , Little Silver Hair and the Fairies by J.B. Buckstone ( 1853 ) ; Silver @-@ Locks in Aunt Mavor 's Nursery Tales ( 1858 ) ; <unk> in George MacDonald 's " The Golden Key " ( 1867 ) ; Golden Hair in Aunt Friendly 's Nursery Book ( ca . 1868 ) ; Silver @-@ Hair and <unk> at various times ; Little Golden @-@ Hair ( 1889 ) ; and finally Goldilocks in Old Nursery Stories and Rhymes ( 1904 ) . Tatar credits Flora Annie Steel with naming the child ( 1918 ) . 
 Goldilocks 's fate varies in the many retellings : in some versions , she runs into the forest , in some she is almost eaten by the bears but her mother rescues her , in some she vows to be a good child , and in some she returns home . Whatever her fate , Goldilocks fares better than Southey 's vagrant old woman who , in his opinion , deserved a stint in the House of Correction , and far better than Miss Mure 's old woman who is impaled upon a steeple in St Paul 's church @-@ yard . 
 Southey 's all @-@ male ursine trio has not been left untouched over the years . The group was re @-@ cast as Papa , Mama , and Baby Bear , but the date of this change is disputed . Tatar indicates it occurred by 1852 , while Katherine Briggs suggests the event occurred in 1878 with Mother Goose 's Fairy Tales published by Routledge . With the publication of the tale by " Aunt Fanny " in 1852 , the bears became a family in the illustrations to the tale but remained three bachelor bears in the text . 
 In <unk> 's version of 1858 , the two larger bears are brother and sister , and friends to the little bear . This arrangement represents the evolution of the ursine trio from the traditional three male bears to a family of father , mother , and child . In a publication ca . 1860 , the bears have become a family at last in both text and illustrations : " the old papa bear , the mama bear , and the little boy bear " . In a Routledge publication c 1867 , Papa Bear is called Rough Bruin , Mama Bear is Mammy Muff , and Baby Bear is called Tiny . Inexplicably , the illustrations depict the three as male bears . 
 In publications subsequent to Aunt Fanny 's of 1852 , Victorian nicety required editors to routinely and silently alter Southey 's " [ T ] here she sate till the bottom of the chair came out , and down came her 's , plump upon the ground " to read " and down she came " , omitting any reference to the human bottom . The cumulative effect of the several changes to the tale since its original publication was to transform a fearsome oral tale into a cozy family story with an unrealized hint of menace . 
 = = Interpretations = = 
 Maria Tatar in The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales ( 2002 ) notes that Southey 's tale is sometimes viewed as a cautionary tale that imparts a lesson about the hazards of wandering off and exploring unknown territory . Like " The Tale of the Three Little Pigs " , the story uses repetitive formulas to engage the child 's attention and to reinforce the point about safety and shelter . Tatar points out that the tale is typically framed today as a discovery of what is " just right " , but for earlier generations , it was a tale about an intruder who could not control herself when encountering the possessions of others . 
 In The Uses of Enchantment ( 1976 ) , the child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim describes Goldilocks as " poor , beautiful , and charming " , and notes that the story does not describe her positively except for her hair . Bettelheim mainly discussed the tale in terms of <unk> 's struggle to move past Oedipal issues to confront adolescent identity problems . 
 In Bettelheim 's view , the tale fails to encourage children " to pursue the hard labor of solving , one at a time , the problems which growing up presents " , and does not end as fairy tales should with the " promise of future happiness awaiting those who have mastered their Oedipal situation as a child " . He believes the tale is an escapist one that thwarts the child reading it from gaining emotional maturity . 
 Tatar criticizes Bettelheim 's views : " [ His ] reading is perhaps too invested in <unk> fairy tales , that is , in turning them into vehicles that convey messages and set forth behavioral models for the child . While the story may not solve oedipal issues or sibling rivalry as Bettelheim believes " Cinderella " does , it suggests the importance of respecting property and the consequences of just ' trying out ' things that do not belong to you . " 
 Elms suggests Bettelheim may have missed the anal aspect of the tale that would make it helpful to the child 's personality development . In Handbook of <unk> Elms describes Southey 's tale not as one of <unk> post @-@ Oedipal ego development but as one of Freudian pre @-@ Oedipal <unk> . He believes the story appeals chiefly to preschoolers who are engaged in " cleanliness training , maintaining environmental and behavioral order , and distress about disruption of order " . His own experience and his observation of others lead him to believe children align themselves with the tidy , organized ursine protagonists rather than the unruly , delinquent human antagonist . In Elms 's view , the <unk> of " The Story of the Three Bears " can be traced directly to Robert Southey 's fastidious , dirt @-@ obsessed aunt who raised him and passed her obsession to him in a milder form . 
 = = Literary elements = = 
 The story makes extensive use of the literary rule of three , featuring three chairs , three bowls of porridge , three beds , and the three title characters who live in the house . There are also three sequences of the bears discovering in turn that someone has been eating from their porridge , sitting in their chairs , and finally , lying in their beds , at which point is the climax of Goldilocks being discovered . This follows three earlier sequences of Goldilocks trying the bowls of porridge , chairs , and beds successively , each time finding the third " just right " . Author Christopher Booker characterizes this as the " dialectical three " , where " the first is wrong in one way , the second in another or opposite way , and only the third , in the middle , is just right . " Booker continues " This idea that the way forward lies in finding an exact middle path between opposites is of extraordinary importance in storytelling " . This concept has spread across many other disciplines , particularly developmental psychology , biology , economics and engineering where it is called the " Goldilocks Principle " .

 = Killer Instinct Gold = 
 Killer Instinct Gold is a 1996 fighting video game based on the arcade game Killer Instinct 2 . The game was developed by Rare and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 video game console . As in other series entries , players control characters who fight on a 2D plane set against a 3D background . Players press buttons to punch and kick their opponent in chains of successive hits , known as combos . Large combo successions lead to stronger attacks and brutal , stylistic finisher moves underscored by an announcer . Characters — including a gargoyle , a ninja , and a femme fatale — fight in settings such as a jungle and a spaceship . Killer Instinct Gold includes the arcade release 's characters , combos , and 3D , pre @-@ rendered environments , but excludes its full @-@ motion video sequences and some voiceovers due to restrictions of the cartridge media format . The Gold release adds a training mode , new camera views , and improved audiovisuals . 
 Rare was a prominent second @-@ party developer for Nintendo in the 1990s , and their Killer Instinct series was produced as an exclusive partnership in response to the popularity of Mortal Kombat . Following the success of the 1995 Killer Instinct port for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System , Rare began a sequel for the same platform but transitioned development to its successor , the Nintendo 64 , upon its unveiling . Gold was scheduled as a launch title for the new console but was delayed until its North American release in November 1996 . It was released in other regions in May 1997 . Gold was later included in Rare 's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation , Rare Replay . 
 Reviewers preferred the Nintendo 64 port over the arcade release , and appreciated its audiovisual enhancements , but felt that its graphical upgrades and memorization @-@ based combo gameplay were insufficient when compared to fighting games like Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter 2 . Critics recommended Gold primarily for fans of the series and genre , but IGN reported that even fans were upset by changes in the combo system and the absence of several well @-@ liked characters . Gold ultimately did not replicate the success of its Super NES predecessor , and the series remained dormant through its 2002 acquisition by Microsoft until its 2013 reboot . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Killer Instinct Gold is a port of the arcade fighting video game Killer Instinct 2 . Like other entries in the Killer Instinct series , two characters controlled by humans or artificial intelligence fight in one @-@ on @-@ one matches to deplete their opponent 's health meter . While the characters move and attack on a 2D plane , the background is depicted in pre @-@ rendered 3D and gives the appearance of depth . Players fight with a six @-@ button setup : three punch buttons and three kick buttons , similar to the controls in Street Fighter II . Players can chain together a series of hits into " combos " for increased damage , with some combos requiring a specific , memorized sequences of button presses . Multiple hit combos lead to stronger attacks and brutal , stylistic finisher moves , or " fatalities " . Characters on the receiving end of a combo can interrupt the sequence with a " combo breaker " move . An announcer narrates major game moments with phrases like , " Awesome combo ! " 
 Gold features arcade , team , and tournament gameplay modes . The game 's new " practice mode " lets players rehearse their skills and follow tutorials . In the new knockout tournament mode , players cycle through a preselected team of characters when their current character is eliminated . Gold features the same characters , combos , and environments available in the arcade Killer Instinct 2 . Players can unlock new character appearances , gameplay difficulty levels , and additional playable character . Gold and Killer Instinct 2 's shared roster contains ten characters in total : three new additions and seven returning from the previous title . Characters include a gargoyle , a ninja , and a femme fatale . Fights are set in spaceship , jungle , and castle settings , among others , and some backgrounds are interactive . Gold features new camera functions that automatically zoom to better frame the fight . The release also includes enhancements to the 3D backgrounds and an upgraded soundtrack , but excludes the full @-@ motion video sequences and some voiceovers from the arcade release due to the Nintendo 64 's cartridge media data storage restrictions . While Gold 's backgrounds are fluidly animated in 60 frames per second , its character animations have fewer frames than its arcade equivalent . 
 = = Development = = 
 Killer Instinct Gold was developed by Rare during a time when the British company was becoming a prominent second @-@ party developer and ally for Nintendo , the game 's publisher . Rare modeled its Killer Instinct series on the Mortal Kombat fighting game series . As a departure from fighting game staples such as Street Fighter , both Killer Instinct and Mortal Kombat championed an aggressively fast pace of gameplay and placed less emphasis on patience and mastery . The Killer Instinct series began as an arcade game ( 1994 ) and became known as " Nintendo 's version of Mortal Kombat " upon its release on the company 's Super NES ( 1995 ) and Game Boy ( 1995 ) . The games industry expected a sequel after the Super NES version 's wide success , with over three million copies sold . Following market demand , Rare began development on a sequel for the arcade . They had a Super NES version in development , but transitioned to Nintendo 's new Nintendo 64 after the console 's announcement . The Killer Instinct development team split itself between the arcade version and the Nintendo 64 release that would become Killer Instinct Gold . The latter began work as soon as Rare received its Nintendo 64 development kit . 
 The seven @-@ person development team started work on the sequel with the ideas that did not fit into the original . They also incorporated feedback from Killer Instinct players . Killer Instinct 2 's art , design , and programming changed continuously throughout development up until its release . Kevin Bayliss designed the characters and Chris Tilston developed the game engine with feedback from Nintendo 's Ken Lobb . Rare used compression technology to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo 64 cartridge . While Killer Instinct was planned to showcase the Nintendo 64 's power , the console was more limited than Rare 's arcade setup , and Rare had to optimize the arcade version to run on the console . The arcade version used an animation to give the illusion of the camera panning horizontally , but the console version used static image files with less detail . 
 The game was originally scheduled to be among the first two launch titles for the Nintendo 64 , but missed the release window . Gold released in North America on November 25 , 1996 , and in other countries the following year , on May 9 , 1997 . Its soundtrack received a compact disc release , which was rare for Western video games in the 1990s . Rare , under contract , ultimately finished its Super NES port of Killer Instinct 2 , but Nintendo chose not to release it . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In 1996 , reviewers compared Gold favorably to Killer Instinct 2 , but thought that its graphics were not sufficiently upgraded . Doug Perry ( IGN ) felt that the Killer Instinct 2 graphics in Gold appeared dated and gave it a " cheesy 80s feel " . He and Ed Lomas ( CVG ) noticed fewer animation frames when compared with the arcade release . IGN preferred Gold 's crisp music but would have liked more characters and distinctions from the arcade version . GameSpot named Gold the best entry in the series at the time , but other reviewers only recommended Gold for fans of the series and genre and those most desperate for a Nintendo 64 fighting game . Colin Williamson ( AllGame ) said that Killer Instinct Gold was best for players who want " Mortal Kombat on speed " with a " hyperactive Barry White " announcer . 
 Within the fighting game genre , GameSpot considered Gold to be better than the other Nintendo 64 fighting game , Mortal Kombat Trilogy . GamePro readers chose Gold as the second best fighting game of 1996 after Tekken 2 . Next Generation and Marcus Hawkins ( N64 Magazine ) agreed that Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter 2 had outclassed Killer Instinct Gold . N64 concluded that even in the Nintendo 64 's then @-@ meager catalog of titles , Killer Instinct Gold did not distinguish itself , and thus had a lifespan of " weeks rather than months " . Killer Instinct Gold waned from a celebrated announcement to a quiet European release . 
 Reviewers highly praised the game 's sound and environment backdrops , but noted <unk> in the character animations . IGN appreciated its stereo sound , special effects , and camera work . Scary Larry ( GamePro ) liked Gold 's sound except for the explosion and " death screech " sound effects . GameSpot considered the graphics " near perfect " apart from the character animations . ( CVG wrote that characters appeared blurry because of " fuzzy anti @-@ aliasing " when the camera zoomed in . ) Game Informer was similarly impressed by the graphics , but one reviewer commented that Gold had few other positive features . As an exception , GamePro praised the " lively " character animations over the " flawed " backgrounds . 
 While GamePro gave the game perfect ratings in controls and fun , Next Generation considered the controls as awkward as they were on the Super NES and ultimately wrote that the game was " not much fun " . Many reviewers criticized how Gold 's combo @-@ based gameplay diminished the importance of skill . IGN wrote that this shallow emphasis on " archaic " combo sequence memorization prevented creative improvisation . CVG wrote that Gold had little " flow " : every match was focused on huge combos rather than small , strategic moves . Thus , players were forced to train before they could effectively produce combos long enough to win matches . Daily Radar and CVG praised the training mode , which the latter also liked in the game 's Super NES predecessor . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 After the 1996 Killer Instinct Gold did not sell as well as the Super NES version of the original , the series went dormant . IGN reported in 2010 that Killer Instinct Gold had upset series fans by changing the combo move sets and omitting " fan favorite " characters from the original . The website added that Rare knew that fans wanted a new entry for Killer Instinct over one for any other Rare franchise . Microsoft purchased Rare in 2002 , ending the acquisition 's prominent alliance with Nintendo . Microsoft and Rare revived the series for the Xbox One platform in 2013 . In 2014 , GamesRadar retrospectively ranked Gold the 35th best game on the Nintendo 64 console . 
 Killer Instinct Gold was later emulated in the August 2015 Xbox One compilation of 30 Rare titles , Rare Replay . Nintendo Life wrote that Gold 's graphics had not aged well . The New York Daily News reported that Killer Instinct Gold , while " underrated " in its time , had withered into an outdated frustration as the anthology 's biggest letdown . Destructoid singled out Gold as the collection 's worst title , namely because it was a " barebones " Killer Instinct 2 . Twenty years after the original release , Retro Gamer wrote that while Killer Instinct was popular in arcades , it had been outdone by Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter 2 by 1996 , and ultimately proved mediocre in comparison . 
 = The Chinese Restaurant = 
 " The Chinese Restaurant " is the 11th episode of the sitcom Seinfeld 's second season on NBC , and is the show 's 16th episode overall . The episode revolves around protagonist Jerry ( Jerry Seinfeld ) and his friends Elaine Benes ( Julia Louis @-@ Dreyfus ) and George Costanza ( Jason Alexander ) waiting for a table at a Chinese restaurant , on their way to see Plan 9 from Outer Space . Unable to get a table , they decide to wait and talk amongst each other , while George tries to use the phone that is constantly occupied and Jerry recognizes a woman , but he is unsure where he has seen her before . 
 Co @-@ written by the series ' creators Seinfeld and head writer Larry David , the episode is set in real time , without any scene @-@ breaks . It was the first episode in which Jerry 's neighbor Kramer ( Michael Richards ) did not appear , much to Richards ' disappointment , as it turned out to become a highlight among the show 's episodes . Considered a " bottle episode " , NBC executives objected to its production and broadcast due to its lack of an involved storyline , thinking that audiences would be uninterested . It was not until David threatened to quit if the network forced any major changes upon the script that NBC allowed the episode to be produced , though the network postponed broadcast to the near end of season two . 
 First broadcast in the United States on May 23 , 1991 , the episode gained a Nielsen rating of 11 @.@ 7 / 21 . Television critics reacted positively to " The Chinese Restaurant " , which is widely considered as one of the show 's " classic episodes " . In 1998 , a South Florida Sun @-@ Sentinel critic wrote that the episode , along with season four 's " The Contest " , " broke new sitcom ground " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Jerry , George , and Elaine decide to eat dinner without a reservation at a Chinese restaurant before seeing a one @-@ night showing of Plan 9 from Outer Space , which Jerry exultantly calls " the worst movie ever made ! " The maître d ' ( James Hong ) repeatedly tells the party they will receive a table in " 5 , 10 minutes " , but with no result . Besides having only a short time until the movie begins , the characters have other worries : 
 Jerry previously lied to his uncle , saying he could not join him for dinner ; he prefers to see the film , yet feels guilty . 
 George is anxious because , the night before , he left his girlfriend Tatiana during foreplay because he needed to use a bathroom and thought hers was too close to her bedroom to provide enough privacy . He wants to call Tatiana to invite her to join them , but is repeatedly prevented from using the restaurant 's payphone , as it is first occupied by a man ( Michael <unk> ) who ignores George , and then by a woman who is rude to him . 
 Jerry notices a woman ( Judy Kain ) he has seen before , but cannot remember her name . 
 Elaine is frustrated by being extremely hungry . 
 Jerry dares Elaine to take an egg roll from someone 's plate and eat it , offering her " fifty bucks " to do so . Elaine approaches a table with an elderly couple and tells them that her friend will give her $ 50 to eat one of their egg rolls , and she is willing to give them $ 25 of it . As she softly speaks the offer without moving her lips , they fail to comprehend her . She awkwardly walks away , then laughs off her attempt . George is finally able to call Tatiana , the answering machine answers his call , and George leaves a message . Tatiana calls the restaurant to reach George , but the maître d ' calls " Cartwright " instead of " Costanza " , and she " said curse words " when he told her that George is not there . When the mysterious woman encounters Jerry , he remembers belatedly that she is his uncle 's receptionist . 
 Plan after plan is thwarted : Elaine tries bribing the maître d ' , but is unsuccessful . They could get food to go , but they can 't eat Chinese food in a taxicab . Elaine is ravenous , but refuses to eat concession stand food at the movie theater . 
 George decides he 's no longer in the mood for the film ; Elaine wants to leave and get a hamburger ; Jerry decides that he might as well have dinner with his uncle . As soon as they leave , the maître d ' calls their party .

 " The Chinese Restaurant " was written by series co @-@ creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and directed by Tom Cherones , who directed all of season two 's episodes . David came up with the idea of the real @-@ time episode while he and Seinfeld were waiting for a table at a Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles . When David presented the episode to NBC executives , he received a negative reaction . The network felt that there was no real story and viewers would not be interested . Executive Warren Littlefield commented that he thought there were pages missing from the script he had received . David argued that each character had a storyline : Jerry 's story was he recognized a woman but did not know from where ; Elaine 's story was that she was very hungry ; and George 's story was that he was unable to use the phone . NBC disagreed and objected to the broadcast of the episode . To satisfy the executives , staff writer Larry Charles suggested the group 's storyline to be on their way to a one @-@ night screening of Plan 9 from Outer Space , and thus introducing a " ticking clock " scenario to the story . When the NBC executives still objected , David threatened to quit the show if the network would force any major changes upon the script . Seinfeld supported David and NBC eventually allowed them to produce " The Chinese Restaurant " without any significant alterations , although they strongly advised them not go through with it , and postponed the broadcast until near the end of the season . In 2015 , Seinfeld writer Spike Feresten revealed that the host 's calling " Cartwright " instead of " Costanza " was a subtle allusion to the classic western show Bonanza . " Bonanza " rhymes with " Costanza " and the show 's main characters are the " Cartwright " family . 
 " The Chinese Restaurant " was first read by its cast on December 5 , 1990 , and it was filmed on December 11 . Filming took place at CBS Studio Center in Studio City , Los Angeles , California , where all filming for the second season took place . As only one location was used , it took roughly half of the time it usually took for an episode to be filmed . Cast members have remarked that the filming was shorter than on any other episode . A few changes were made ; in the first draft of the script , George , Jerry , and Elaine entered the restaurant talking about their least favorite holiday . In the version that aired , they talk about combining the jobs of policemen and <unk> into a single job . In the original draft , the three friends also discussed how to spend the long waiting period in the future , with George suggesting they bring a deck of cards and that Jerry bring a jigsaw puzzle with nothing but penguins . One scene was cut before broadcast , featuring George explaining to Jerry that he pulled his hamstring while trying to <unk> the covers of a hotel bed during his recent stay in Boston . George can be seen grabbing his hamstring as he walks to the phone . The scene was later included on the Seinfeld seasons one and two DVD boxset . 
 At one point in the episode , Jerry mentions having a sister . She is never again mentioned in the series . 
 = = = Cast = = = 
 " The Chinese Restaurant " was the first episode that did not feature regular character Kramer ( Michael Richards ) , Jerry 's neighbor . David explained that the reason for Kramer 's absence was because — during Seinfeld 's early seasons — the character never left his apartment and did not go out with the other three . Richards was still displeased with the absence of his character , as he felt the episode was a breakthrough and — as such — essential for the series ' development . In an interview for the Seinfeld first and second season DVD box set , he commented , " The Chinese restaurant episode was so unique , and I just wanted to be a part of that because it was cutting edge . I knew that was a very important episode ; it was so odd . " 
 Michael <unk> — who portrayed one of the payphone occupants — would return in season five as a photographer in " The Puffy Shirt " . The maître d ' was portrayed by actor James Hong ; it is one of the actor 's most famous roles in the United States . ( In fact , he had a small part in a season one episode of The Bob Newhart Show in 1972 , portraying a man who is mistaken for a maître d ' . ) Judy Kain — known for a recurring role on Married ... with Children — guest @-@ starred as Lorraine Catalano , the receptionist of Jerry 's uncle . David Tress guest @-@ starred as Mr. Cohen , a guest who enters the restaurant and receives a table without reservation , as he is good friends with the maître d ' . Larry David 's voice can be heard among the group of elderly people Elaine offers money for one of their egg @-@ rolls . Norman Brenner — who worked as Richards ' stand @-@ in on the show for all its nine seasons — appears as an extra ; he is sitting by the door of the restaurant when George , Jerry , and Elaine enter , and is still at the same spot when they leave .

 The episode is widely considered to encapsulate Seinfeld 's " show about nothing " concept , with The Tampa Tribune critic Walt Belcher calling it " the ultimate episode about nothing " , and Lavery and Dunne describing it as " existential " . Critics had a similar reaction to season three 's " The Parking Garage " , in which the four central characters spent the whole episode looking for their car . The structure of " The Chinese Restaurant " — described as " elongation " — drags a small event out over the course of an entire episode . Lavery and Dunne suggest that this structure critiques sitcoms with implied moral lessons ( such as those found in so @-@ called " very special episodes " ) . Vincent Brook — as part of his analysis regarding the influence of Jewish culture on Seinfeld — has said that the episode also conveys the theme of entrapment and confinement in a small space , a recurring theme on the show . The relationship between the characters and food is another recurring theme of the series . In Seinfeld , specific food items are associated with individual characters and food itself is a " signifier of social contracts " . 
 Linda S. Ghent , Professor in the Department of Economics at Eastern Illinois University , discusses some economic issues in this episode . Just before Jerry 's dare about the egg roll , Elaine says , " You know , it 's not fair people are seated first come first served . It should be based on who 's <unk> . I feel like just going over there and taking some food off somebody 's plate . " Ghent discusses the history and reasoning behind rationing mechanisms and economic efficiency , which are the bases behind how tables are seated at restaurants , rationales which are perhaps invisible to hungry or impatient customers . Elaine 's attempt at bribery is an example of opportunity cost : the trio are willing to pay more than usual to get a table , if at least they can get a table . Ghent also gives Jerry 's willingness to lie to his uncle as another example of opportunity cost : " Did I do a bad thing by lying to my uncle and saying I couldn 't go to dinner ? Plan Nine from Outer Space – one night only , the big screen ! My hands are tied ! "

 When the episode initially aired in the United States on NBC on May 23 , 1991 , it received a Nielsen rating of 11 @.@ 7 and an audience share of 21 — this meant that 11 @.@ 7 % of American households watched the episode , and that 21 % of televisions in use at the time were tuned to it . Seinfeld was the eighteenth most @-@ watched show of the week , and the sixth most @-@ watched show on NBC . NBC executives held a meeting after the broadcast to determine the fate of the show , and decided it would receive a third season order if the writers would put more effort into episode storylines . 
 " The Chinese Restaurant " received very positive responses from critics and is considered one of Seinfeld 's first " classic episodes " . Kit Boss , a critic for the Ocala Star @-@ Banner , wrote that the episode was " like real life , but with better dialogue " . Various critics and news sources have praised how the episode defines the show 's " show about nothing " concept . Critics have also noted that aside from being a turning point for the show , the episode also became a turning point for television sitcoms ; one South Florida Sun @-@ Sentinel critic commented that the episode , along with the season four episode " The Contest " , " [ ... ] broke new sitcom ground and expanded the lexicon of the ' 90s .

 A Momentary Lapse of Reason is the thirteenth studio album by the English progressive rock band Pink Floyd , released in the UK and US in September 1987 , on the labels EMI and Columbia . It followed guitarist David Gilmour 's decision to include material recorded for his third solo album on a new Pink Floyd album with drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright . Although for legal reasons Wright could not be re @-@ admitted to the band , Wright and Mason helped Gilmour craft what became the first Pink Floyd album since the December 1985 departure of bass guitarist , singer , and primary songwriter Roger Waters . 
 A Momentary Lapse of Reason was recorded primarily on Gilmour 's converted houseboat , Astoria . Its production was marked by an ongoing legal dispute with Waters as to who owned the rights to Pink Floyd 's name , an issue resolved several months after the album was released . Unlike many of Pink Floyd 's studio albums , A Momentary Lapse of Reason has no central theme and is instead a collection of songs written by Gilmour , sometimes with outside songwriters . 
 Though it received mixed reviews and was derided by Waters , A Momentary Lapse of Reason outsold Pink Floyd 's previous album The Final Cut ( 1983 ) , and was supported by a successful world tour . In the US , it has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA .

Guitarist David Gilmour expressed feelings about his strained relationship with Waters on his second solo album , About Face ( 1984 ) , and finished the accompanying tour as Waters began touring to promote his debut solo album , The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking . Although both had enlisted the aid of a range of successful performers , including in Waters ' case Eric Clapton , their solo acts attracted fewer fans than Pink Floyd ; poor ticket sales forced Gilmour to cancel several concerts , and critic David Fricke felt that Waters ' show was " a petulant echo , a transparent attempt to prove that Roger Waters was Pink Floyd " . Waters returned to the US in March 1985 with a second tour , this time without the support of CBS Records , which had expressed its preference for a new Pink Floyd album ; Waters criticised the corporation as " a machine " . 
 After drummer Nick Mason attended one of Waters ' London performances in 1985 , he admitted that he missed touring under the Pink Floyd name . His visit coincided with the release in August that year of his second solo album , Profiles , on which Gilmour sang . With a shared love of aviation , Mason and Gilmour were taking flying lessons and later together bought a de Havilland Dove aeroplane . Gilmour was working on other collaborations , including a performance for Bryan Ferry at 1985 's Live Aid concert , and co @-@ produced The Dream Academy 's self @-@ titled debut album . 
 In December 1985 , Waters announced that he had left Pink Floyd , which he believed was " a spent force creatively " . However , after the failure of his About Face tour , Gilmour hoped to continue with the Pink Floyd name . The threat of a lawsuit from Gilmour , Mason and CBS Records was meant to compel Waters to write and produce another Pink Floyd album with his bandmates , who had barely participated in making The Final Cut ; Gilmour had been especially critical of that 1983 release , labelling it as " cheap filler " and " meandering rubbish " . The lawsuit left Waters with only one other option : to formally resign from Pink Floyd in order to protect himself from a lawsuit that , he said , " would have wiped me out completely " . 
 According to Gilmour , " I told [ Waters ] before he left , ' If you go , man , we 're carrying on . Make no bones about it , we would carry on ' , and Roger replied : ' You 'll never fucking do it . ' " Waters had written to EMI and Columbia declaring his intention to leave the group and asking them to release him from his contractual obligations . He also dispensed with the services of Pink Floyd manager Steve O 'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs . This left Gilmour and Mason , in their view , free to continue with the Pink Floyd name . 
 In Waters ' absence , Gilmour had been recruiting musicians for a new project . Some months previously , keyboard player Jon Carin had jammed with Gilmour at his Hookend studio , where he composed the chord progression for what later became " Learning to Fly " , and so was invited onto the team . Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin ( co @-@ producer of 1979 's The Wall ) to help consolidate their material ; Ezrin had turned down Waters ' offer of a role on the development of his new solo album , Radio K.A.O.S. , saying it was " far easier for Dave and I to do our version of a Floyd record " . Ezrin arrived in England in mid @-@ 1986 for what Gilmour later described as " mucking about with a lot of demos " . At this stage , there was no firm commitment to a new Pink Floyd release , and Gilmour maintained that the new material might end up on a third solo album . CBS representative Stephen <unk> hoped for a new Pink Floyd album , but in a meeting in November 1986 , told Gilmour and Ezrin that the music " doesn 't sound a fucking thing like Pink Floyd " . Gilmour later admitted that the new project was difficult without Waters . Gilmour had experimented with songwriters such as Eric Stewart and Roger McGough , but eventually settled on Anthony Moore , who would be credited as co @-@ writer of " Learning to Fly " and " On the Turning Away " . Instead of writing a concept album , Gilmour settled for the more conventional approach of a collection of songs without a thematic link . By the end of that year , he had decided to turn the new material into a Pink Floyd project . 
 = = Recording = = 
 A Momentary Lapse of Reason was recorded in several different studios , mainly Gilmour 's houseboat studio Astoria moored on the Thames ; according to Ezrin , " working there was just magical , so inspirational ; kids sculling down the river , geese flying by ... " Andy Jackson , a colleague of Floyd cohort James Guthrie , was brought in to engineer the recordings . During sessions held between November 1986 and February 1987 , Gilmour 's band worked on new material , which in a marked change from previous Floyd albums was recorded with a 24 @-@ track analogue machine , and overdubbed onto a 32 @-@ track Mitsubishi digital recorder . This trend of using new technologies was continued with the use of MIDI synchronisation , aided by an Apple Macintosh computer . 
 After agreeing to rework the material that <unk> had found so objectionable , Gilmour employed session musicians such as Carmine Appice and Jim Keltner . Both drummers , they later replaced Mason on most of the album 's songs ; Mason was concerned that he was too out of practice to perform on the album , and instead busied himself with its sound effects . Some of the drum parts were also performed by drum machines . During the sessions , Gilmour was asked by the wife of Pink Floyd 's former keyboard player , Richard Wright , if he too could contribute to the project . A founding member of the band , Wright had left in 1979 , and there were certain legal obstacles to his return , but after a meeting in Hampstead he was brought back in . Gilmour later admitted in an interview with author Karl Dallas that Wright 's presence " would make us stronger legally and musically " . He was therefore employed as a paid musician , on a weekly wage of $ 11 @,@ 000 , but his contributions were minimal . Most of the keyboard parts had already been recorded , and so from February 1987 Wright played some background reinforcement on a Hammond organ , and a Rhodes piano , along with adding several vocal harmonies . The keyboardist also performed a solo in " On the Turning Away " , which was discarded , according to Wright , " not because they didn 't like it ... they just thought it didn 't fit . " Gilmour later said : " Both Nick and Rick were catatonic in terms of their playing ability at the beginning . Neither of them played on this at all really . In my view , they 'd been destroyed by Roger … " Gilmour 's comments angered Mason , who reflected : " I 'd deny that I was catatonic . I 'd expect that from the opposition , it 's less attractive from one 's allies . At some point , he made some sort of apology . " Mason did concede , however , that Gilmour was nervous about how the album would be perceived . 
 " Learning to Fly " , with its lyrics of " circling sky , Tongue @-@ tied and twisted , just an earthbound misfit , I " , was inspired by Gilmour 's flying lessons , which occasionally conflicted with his studio duties . The track also contains a recording of Mason 's voice , made during takeoff . The band experimented with audio samples , and Ezrin recorded the sound of Gilmour 's boatman ( Langley <unk> ) rowing across the Thames . <unk> ' presence at the sessions was made vital when on one occasion , Astoria began to lift in response to the rapidly rising river , which was pushing the boat against the pier on which it was moored . " The Dogs of War " is a song about " physical and political mercenaries " , according to Gilmour . Its creation came about through a mishap in the studio when a sampling machine began playing a sample of laughter , which the guitarist thought sounded like a dog 's bark . " Terminal Frost " was one of Gilmour 's older demos , which for some time he considered adding lyrics to , but eventually decided to leave as an instrumental . Conversely , the lyrics for " Sorrow " were written before the music . The song 's opening guitar solo was recorded in the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena . A 24 @-@ track mobile studio piped Gilmour 's Fender tracks through a public address system , and the resulting mix was then recorded in surround sound . 
 Despite the tranquil setting offered by Astoria , the sessions were often interrupted by the escalating row between Waters and Pink Floyd over who had the rights to the Pink Floyd name . O 'Rourke , believing that his contract with Waters had been terminated illegally , sued the bassist for £ 25 @,@ 000 of back @-@ commission . In a late @-@ 1986 board meeting of Pink Floyd Music Ltd ( since 1973 , Pink Floyd 's clearing house for all financial transactions ) , Waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to " the new Pink Floyd project " . He immediately applied to the High Court to prevent the Pink Floyd name from ever being used again , but his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed . Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band 's name . Gilmour 's team responded by issuing a non @-@ confrontational press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist ; however , the guitarist later told a Sunday Times reporter : " Roger is a dog in the manger and I 'm going to fight him , no one else has claimed Pink Floyd was entirely them . Anybody who does is extremely arrogant . " Waters twice visited Astoria , and with his wife had a meeting in August 1986 with Ezrin ( the producer later suggested that he was being " checked out " ) . As Waters was still a shareholder and director of Pink Floyd music , he was able to block any decisions made by his former bandmates . Recording moved to Mayfair Studios in February 1987 , and from February to March – under the terms of an agreement with Ezrin to record close to his home – to A & M Studios in Los Angeles : " It was fantastic because ... the lawyers couldn 't call in the middle of recording unless they were calling in the middle of the night . " The bitterness of the row between Waters and Pink Floyd was covered in a November 1987 issue of Rolling Stone , which became the magazine 's best @-@ selling issue of that year . The legal disputes were resolved by the end of 1987 . 
 = = Packaging and title = = 
 Careful consideration was given to the album 's title . The initial three contenders were Signs of Life , Of Promises Broken and Delusions of Maturity . For the first time since 1977 's Animals , designer Storm Thorgerson was employed to work on a Pink Floyd studio album cover . His finished design was a long river of hospital beds arranged on a beach , inspired by a phrase from " Yet Another Movie " and Gilmour 's vague hint of a design that included a bed in a Mediterranean house , as well as " vestiges of relationships that have evaporated , leaving only echoes " . The cover shows hundreds of hospital beds , placed on Saunton Sands in Devon ( where some of the scenes for Pink Floyd – The Wall were filmed ) . The beds were arranged by Thorgerson 's colleague Colin Elgie . A hang glider can be seen in the sky , a clear reference to " Learning to Fly " . The photographer , Robert Dowling , won a gold award at the Association of Photographers Awards for the image , which took about two weeks to create . To drive home the message that Waters had left the band , the inner gatefold featured a group photograph – of just Gilmour and Mason – shot by David Bailey . Its inclusion marked the first time since 1971 's Meddle that a group photo had been used in the artwork of a Pink Floyd album . Richard Wright was represented only by name , on the credit list , although he also appears in photographs included in later reissues . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in the UK and US on 7 September 1987 . It went straight to number three in both countries , held from the top spot by Michael Jackson 's Bad and Whitesnake 's self @-@ titled album . 
 In comparison with The Final Cut , Gilmour presented A Momentary Lapse as a return to the Floyd of older days , citing his belief that towards the end of Waters ' tenure , lyrics were more important than music . Gilmour said : " The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here were so successful not just because of Roger 's contributions , but also because there was a better balance between the music and the lyrics [ than on later albums . ] " He added that with A Momentary Lapse , he had tried to restore this earlier , more successful balance . Waters was scathing in his assessment of the new work , a view with which Wright later partly agreed , saying : " Roger 's criticisms are fair . It 's not a band album at all . " 
 Writing in Q magazine , Phil Sutcliffe contended that it " does sound like a Pink Floyd album " and highlighted the two @-@ part " A New Machine " as , variously , " a chillingly beautiful vocal exploration , a chorale of multitrack , echo and distortion broken into aching fragments by long moments of silence " and " [ a ] brilliant stroke of imagination " . Sutcliffe concluded : " A Momentary Lapse is Gilmour 's album to much the same degree that the previous four under Floyd 's name were dominated by Waters … Clearly it wasn 't only business sense and repressed ego but repressed talent which drove the guitarist to insist on continuing under the band brand @-@ name . " Recognising the return to the more music @-@ oriented approach of Pink Floyd 's classic works , Sounds said the album was " back over the wall to where diamonds are crazy , moons have dark sides , and mothers have atom hearts " . 
 Conversely , Greg Quill of the Toronto Star wrote : " Something 's missing here . This is , for all its lumbering weight , not a record that challenges and provokes as Pink Floyd should . A Momentary Lapse of Reason , sorry to say , is mundane , predictable . " Village Voice critic Robert Christgau opined : " In short , you 'd hardly know the group 's <unk> was gone – except that they put out noticeably fewer ideas . " Writing more recently , for AllMusic , William Ruhlmann refers to it as a " Gilmour solo album in all but name " . 
 A Momentary Lapse of Reason was certified Silver and Gold in the UK on 1 October 1987 , and Gold and Platinum in the US on 9 November . It went 2 × Platinum on 18 January the following year , 3 × Platinum on 10 March 1992 , and 4 × Platinum on 16 August 2001 , easily outselling The Final Cut . The album was reissued in 1988 as a limited @-@ edition vinyl album , complete with posters , and a guaranteed ticket application for the band 's upcoming UK concerts . The album was digitally remastered and re @-@ released in 1994 , and a tenth anniversary edition was issued in the US three years later . In 2011 , A Momentary Lapse was again remastered for inclusion in the band 's Discovery box set ; this time Wright 's name had been restored as being a member of the band and the band photo ( of Gilmour and Mason ) has been removed in favour of additional artwork by <unk> . 
 = = Tour = = 
 The decision to tour in support of the album was made before it was even complete . Early rehearsals were chaotic ; Mason and Wright were completely out of practice , and realising he had taken on too much work , Gilmour asked Bob Ezrin to take charge . Matters were complicated when Waters contacted several US promoters , and threatened to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name . Gilmour and Mason funded the start @-@ up costs ( Mason , separated from his wife , used his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral ) . Some promoters were offended by Waters ' threat , and several months later 60 @,@ 000 tickets went on sale in Toronto , selling out within hours . 
 As the new line @-@ up ( with Wright ) toured throughout North America , Waters ' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was , on occasion , close by . The bassist had forbidden any members of Pink Floyd from attending his concerts , which were generally in smaller venues than those housing his former band 's performances . Waters also issued a writ for copyright fees for the band 's use of the flying pig , and Pink Floyd responded by attaching a huge set of male genitalia to the balloon 's underside to distinguish it from Waters ' design . By November 1987 , Waters appeared to admit defeat , and on 23 December a legal settlement was finally reached at a meeting on Astoria . Mason and Gilmour were allowed use of the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity , and Waters would be granted , amongst other things , rights to The Wall . However , the bickering continued , with Waters issuing the occasional slight against his former friends , and Gilmour and Mason responding by making light of Waters ' claims that they would fail without him . 
 The Momentary Lapse tour was phenomenally successful . In every venue booked in the US it beat box office records , making it the most successful US tour by any band that year . Tours of Australia , Japan , and Europe soon followed , before the band returned twice to the US . Almost every venue was sold out . A live album , Delicate Sound of Thunder , was released on 22 November 1988 , followed in June 1989 by a concert video . A few days later , the live album was played in orbit , on board Soyuz TM @-@ 7 . The tour eventually came to an end by closing the Silver Clef Award Winners Concert , at Knebworth Park on 30 June 1990 , after 200 performances , a gross audience of 4 @.@ 25 million fans , and box office receipts of more than £ 60 million ( not including merchandising ) .

 = Turks in the Tang military = 
 The military of the Tang Dynasty was staffed with a large population of Turkic soldiers , referred to as Tujue in Chinese sources . Tang elites in northern China were familiar with Turkic culture , a factor that contributed to the Tang acceptance of Turkic recruits . The Tang emperor Taizong adopted the title of " Heavenly Kaghan " and promoted a cosmopolitan empire . Taizong regularly recruited and promoted military officers of Turkic ancestry , whose steppe experience contributed to the western and northern expansion of the Tang empire . The Turkic general Ashina She 'er participated in the Tang capture of the Karakhoja , Karasahr , and Kucha kingdoms in Xinjiang . The half @-@ Turkic general An Lushan started a revolt that led to the decline of Tang Dynasty . 
 The <unk> inscriptions by the Gokturks were critical of the Turks that had served the Tang Dynasty , and condemned them for helping the Chinese emperor expand his burgeoning empire . The Turkic soldiers stationed by the Chinese in the Tang garrisons of Central Asia settled in the region , spreading Turkic languages in an area that had been predominantly Indo @-@ European . 
 = = Background = = 
 The empire of the Tang Dynasty was more cosmopolitan and diverse than the earlier Han Dynasty . The Tang Dynasty elites of northern China had an interest in Turkic culture and intermingled with the people of the steppes . The setting of one Tang poem describes a <unk> , and the performance of a Turkic actress was hosted in the emperor 's palace Following the Tang Dynasty 's defeat of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate , the government authorized the settlement of Turks along the borders of the Tang empire . Turkic officers of the former khaganate were recruited as generals in the Tang military , and their experience with steppe warfare contributed to the Tang 's military successes as it expanded westward . 
 = = = Emperor Taizong and multiculturalism = = = 
 Emperor Taizong , also known by his personal name Li Shimin , was familiar with the culture of the steppe nomads and employed military strategies using steppe tactics as a prince . Taizong was a skilled horsemen , and during a celebration of his victory and ascension to the throne , sacrificed a horse in a ritual derived from a Turkic religious practice . He was able to outmaneuver the heavy cavalry of the Sui Dynasty with his light cavalry , a characteristic of steppe warfare . Taizong shared personal relationships with Turkic allies as a prince , reinforced through oaths sworn as blood brothers . His later successes as an emperor against the armies of Central Asia through diplomacy and divide and rule are the result of his early experiences with Turkic culture . 
 Taizong 's adoption of the Heavenly Kaghan title was used to legitimize his role as a steppe khan not solely as a Chinese emperor with the title of Son of Heaven . He valued the kaghan title and was sincere about his role as a leader of Central Asia . He sought to solidify his claim as a kaghan by organizing a gathering of Turkic leaders in the <unk> fortress during the last years of his reign to reconfirm his title . 
 While mostly symbolic , the title of Heavenly Kaghan shows Taizong 's open attitudes towards the existence of a multicultural and ethnically diverse Tang empire . Taizong was proud of his policies promoting ethnic equality , and was reported to have said that , " The emperors since ancient times have all appreciated the Chinese and depreciated the barbarians . Only I view them as equal . That is why they look upon me as their parent . " 
 He had a paternalistic attitude towards his subjects and believed that it was his duty to treat the Chinese and foreign ethnic groups as equals under one ruler . Taizong 's views grew into state policy as his government recruited Turkic and other non @-@ Han Chinese soldiers into the Tang military . Turkic soldiers were later promoted to higher ranks as commanders and generals . The surname of Li , belonging to the royal family of Li Shimin , was awarded to Han and non @-@ Han officers for their service . 
 Tang relationship with the Turks may have further deepened had the crown prince Li Chengqian , a <unk> , been enthroned as Taizong 's successor . Li Chengqian enthusiastically embraced Turkic customs , and Chinese historian Sima Guang recorded that he : 
 " He [ Chengqian ] <unk> to emulate Turkish speech and their manner of dress . He chose from among his retinue those who had Turkish features and grouped them in bands of five ; he made them plait their hair , wear <unk> , and herd sheep . He had made five wolf 's head banners and tents and set up yurts . The crown prince took up residence here ; he gathered sheep and cooked them , and then , drawing out his waist @-@ knife , he would carve the meat and let everyone eat . " 
 Chengqian was deposed as crown prince by Taizong after his plans to usurp the throne were revealed . He was exiled by Taizong and died as a commoner . 
 = = Turkic generals and Tang military campaigns = = 
 Turkic generals led many of the Tang Dynasty military campaigns that expanded the dynasty 's territorial reach into Central Asia . In total , ten Turks were able to reach the highest military position of general . Ashina She 'er , formerly the ruler of <unk> and <unk> between 630 and 635 and a member of the Ashina clan , was recruited as a Tang general in 635 . He fought as a commander in a successful campaign against Karakhoja in 640 . She 'er was chosen as the general for the military expedition against Karasahr . The Tang loyalist that had been installed as ruler after the first invasion of Karasahr in 644 by Chinese general Guo Xiaoke was deposed by his cousin in a revolt . The usurper was executed after the rebellion was suppressed , and Tang governance returned to the oasis state . She 'er continued onward to the nearby kingdom of Kucha , a state that had supported Karasahr during its war against the Tang . 
 Emperor Taizong himself tended to the injuries of the Turkic Generals <unk> Heli and Ashina Simo , who were both wounded during the campaign against Goguryeo . 
 Ashina Zhong , the brother of She 'er , also served as a Turkic general of the Tang Dynasty , and was a participant in a military performance hosted by Emperor Gaozong in 655 . Another Turkic member of the Ashina clan , Ashina Helu , briefly served as a commander of the Tang army in Gansu before his rise as a kaghan of the Western Turkic Khaganate . During his reign , the Turkic tribes were unified under a single leader . Emperor Gaozong , Taizong 's successor , dispatched a military expedition in 657 against Helu , who had been raiding Tang settlements . The campaign was led by the general Su Dingfang and the Turkic commanders Ashina Mishe and Ashina Buzhen , who were opposed to Helu . Helu was defeated and captured by the Tang forces , and the territories annexed from the Western Turks were placed under Tang governance through the Anxi Protectorate . 
 Gaozong awarded the military service of the Turkic commanders Mishe and Buzhen by appointing them as proxy rulers of ten Western Turkic tribes . The ten tribes were split between the two cousins , and the western half was given to Buzhen while Mishe controlled the eastern tribes . In 685 , the sons of Mishe and Buzhen were sent from the Tang capital of Chang 'an , where they resided , to succeed their fathers in the west . Neither lasted long as Turkic rulers ; one was overthrown by his tribal subjects and the other was deposed by the Second Turkic Khaganate after an invasion in 690 . 
 An Lushan was a Tang general of mixed Turkic and Soghdian ancestry whose revolt between 755 and 763 , the An Shi Rebellion , devastated the Tang Dynasty . Unlike the majority of Turkic military officers , An Lushan served the Tang as an official closely involved with the politics of the imperial court , rather than as a general in a garrison on the Tang frontier . The dynasty might have collapsed had it not been for their alliance with the Uyghur Turks . The rebellion diminished the Tang enthusiasm for cosmopolitanism that was a characteristic of the dynasty 's earlier years . 
 The <unk> inscriptions , a memorial erected by the Turks , lamented the Tang influence on the Turks and the Turkic adoption of Chinese titles : 
 " The Turkish people let their state .... go to ruin ... their sons worthy of becoming lords became slaves , and their daughters worthy of becoming ladies became servants to the Chinese people . The Turkish lords abandoned their Turkish titles . Those lords who were in China held the Chinese titles and obeyed the Chinese emperor and gave their service to him for fifty years . For the benefit of the Chinese , they went on campaigns up to [ the land of ] the <unk> qaghan in the east , where the sun rises , and as far as the Iron Gate in the West . For the benefit of the Chinese emperor they conquered countries . " 
 The inscriptions , made to commemorate the elites of the Second Turkic Empire , stress the importance of loyalty between a kaghan and the ruler 's subjects . The Turks that sided with the Tang are condemned , and the disunity of the Turkic tribes is blamed on a lack of respect for the authority of the kaghan . 
 = = Historical significance = = 
 The Turkic soldiers and generals that worked in the Chinese garrisons of Central Asia spurred Turkic migration into the area . The Turkic language and culture of the Tang soldiers there gradually displaced the indigenous Indo @-@ European languages . The native languages of Sogdian and <unk> disappeared as the Turkic languages spread in the Tarim Basin . 
 The Tang Dynasty declined after the An Shi Rebellion , and the dynasty eventually fell in 907 . During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period , an era of upheaval following the dynasty 's collapse , many of the kingdoms in China were ruled by families of Turkic ancestry . The Shatuo Turks founded the Later Tang in 923 , the Later Jin in 936 , and the Later Han in 947 . 
 = Battle of the Gebora = 
 The Battle of the Gebora was a minor battle of the Peninsular War between Spanish and French armies . It occurred on 19 February 1811 , near Badajoz , Spain , where an outnumbered French force routed and nearly destroyed the Spanish Army of Extremadura . 
 In a bid to help extricate Marshal André Masséna 's army from its position in Portugal — mired in front of Lisbon 's defensive Lines of Torres Vedras — Marshal Jean de Dieu Soult led part of the French Armée du Midi ( Army of the South ) from Andalusia into the neighbouring Spanish region of Extremadura and laid siege to the important fortress town of Badajoz . Viscount Wellington and the Spanish Captain @-@ General Pedro Caro y <unk> , 3rd <unk> de La Romana sent a large Spanish army to raise the siege . La Romana , however , died before the army could depart , and command fell to General Gabriel de <unk> <unk> . Supported by a small force of Portuguese cavalry , the Spaniards reached the town and camped on the nearby heights of San Cristóbal in early February 1811 . 
 When Mendizabal ignored Wellington 's instructions and failed to entrench his army , Soult took advantage of the vulnerable Spanish position and sent a small force to attack the Spaniards . On the morning of 19 February , French forces under Marshal Édouard Mortier quickly defeated the Spanish army , inflicting 1 @,@ 000 casualties and taking 4 @,@ 000 prisoners while losing only 400 men . The victory allowed Soult to concentrate on his assault of Badajoz , which fell to the French on 11 March and remained in French hands until the following year . 
 = = Background = = 
 Despite his partial victory over Marshal Masséna in Portugal at the Battle of Bussaco in September 1810 , Viscount Wellington was forced by Masséna 's manoeuvres to retreat behind the extensive lines of Torres Vedras , a series of forts defending the Portuguese capital of Lisbon . By 10 October 1810 , only the British light division and a few cavalry patrols remained outside the defensive lines , while Masséna 's Army of Portugal concentrated around Sobral , seemingly in preparation to attack the lines . After a fierce skirmish on 14 October , the French dug themselves in rather than launch a full @-@ scale assault , remaining entrenched for a month before withdrawing to a position between Santarém and Rio Maior . 
 Napoleon had previously sent dispatches to Marshal Soult , commander of the Army of the South , urging him to send assistance to Masséna in Portugal . However , the Emperor 's orders , which called for only a small force , were based on outdated intelligence and the situation had changed considerably by the time Soult received them . Thirty thousand Allied troops and six major fortresses now stood between the French army and the Portuguese capital , making an attack against Lisbon virtually impossible . Nevertheless , compelled to act , Soult instead gathered an army of 20 @,@ 000 men , mainly from V Corps , and launched an expedition into Extremadura with the aim of capturing the Spanish fortress at Badajoz , thereby drawing some of the Allied forces away from Masséna and the Lines of Torres Vedras . 
 Soult divided his army into two contingents and advanced into Extremadura via the two main passes leading from Andalusia into the Guadiana valley , with the intention of rejoining at Almendralejo . One of the columns , commanded by Gen. Marie Victor Latour @-@ Maubourg , met little resistance on its march ; on 3 January 1811 the column was confronted by 2 @,@ 500 Spanish and Portuguese cavalry near <unk> , but that force was only a screen covering the retreat beyond the Guadiana of a Spanish infantry division commanded by Gen. Mendizabal . Latour @-@ Maubourg was therefore able to take position near Almendralejo and await the arrival of the second French column . 
 That second column , commanded by Soult and including Gen. Honoré Gazan 's V Corps division , was escorting the French siege @-@ train and therefore had to take a longer , more practicable route into Extremadura . Bad weather and the desertion of the Spanish drivers caused the artillery train to become separated from the escorting infantry , a problem that was further complicated when the column was threatened by 5 @,@ 000 Spanish troops under Gen. Francisco Ballesteros . When confronted by Marshal Mortier , Ballesteros retreated without suffering serious harm but remained a threat to the rear of the French column . For this reason Soult directed Gazan 's infantry to head off the Spanish force and protect the delayed siege @-@ train , while he himself continued onward to Almendralejo with his cavalry . As a result , Soult finally joined Latour @-@ Maubourg on 6 January with only a fraction of his original column and no heavy artillery . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Soult could not besiege so strong a fortress as Badajoz with his reduced force and therefore changed his plans . Sending his light cavalry under Brig. Gen. André Briche to take Mérida and leaving four squadrons of dragoons at Albuera to watch the garrison at Badajoz , he marched with the remainder of his army to invest Olivenza . Wellington had previously advised Gen. Pedro Caro de La Romana , commander of the Spanish Army of Extremadura , either to destroy the fortification at Olivenza or to repair its defenses and fully garrison it ; La Romana in turn had instructed Mendizabal to slight the fortress , but Mendizabal ignored this order and instead reinforced the garrison with four infantry battalions . Soult , arriving on 11 January , was therefore confronted with a strongly <unk> <unk> . The heavy French artillery finally began to arrive on 19 January , and by 22 January a poorly repaired breach in the fortress ' walls had been reopened . The garrison surrendered on 23 January , with over 4 @,@ 000 Spanish troops from the Army of Extremadura taken captive . 
 Soult was now in a difficult position : although he had a large ( 4 @,@ 000 @-@ strong ) contingent of cavalry , deploying two battalions to escort the prisoners taken at Olivenza back to French @-@ held Seville left him only 5 @,@ 500 infantry with which to continue his campaign . Moreover , although his siege @-@ train had begun to arrive , the continued absence of Gazan 's infantry division left him with a weakened army . Despite these problems , Soult decided to besiege Badajoz in hopes that Wellington would send reinforcements to the Spanish fortress and thereby reduce the Allied forces facing Masséna at the Lines of Torres Vedras . On 26 January Soult marched for Badajoz , sending Latour @-@ Maubourg with six cavalry battalions across the Guadiana to blockade the fortress ' northern approach , and by 27 January the first siege of Badajoz had begun . Gazan 's division eventually rejoined Soult 's army on 3 February , further strengthening the besieging force by 6 @,@ 000 men . 
 Meanwhile , Mendizabal had retreated to the Portuguese border after sending two battalions to reinforce the garrison at Badajoz . Weakened by the defeat at Olivenza and by Ballesteros ' continued absence , he sent to La Romana for reinforcements , receiving on 14 January 1 @,@ 800 men sent from Abrantes under the command of Carlos de España . Additionally , about 6 @,@ 000 troops were sent forward from the Lines of Torres Vedras on 19 January , arriving at Elvas ten days later . When these forces joined with Mendizabal 's remaining 3 @,@ 000 men , a Spanish cavalry division and a brigade of Portuguese horse , the Allies had an army almost 15 @,@ 000 <unk> to be under the command of La <unk> which to hold Soult in check . La Romana , however , died of an aneurysm on 23 January , and command of the army then fell to Mendizabal . 
 Before his sudden death , La Romana had met with Wellington and agreed on a plan for the <unk> army was to entrench on the heights of San Cristóbal , with its right flank protected by the fort of San Cristóbal , its front covered by the Gebora and Guadiana rivers , the left guarded by the fortress at Campo Maior , and Elvas protecting the rear . Although aware of this plan when he took command , Mendizabal chose to ignore the instructions upon arriving on the north bank of the Guadiana on 5 February . Instead , he stationed the bulk of his infantry in Badajoz , leaving only a small contingent of infantry and his cavalry below San Cristóbal . On 7 February Mendizabal launched a strong sally against the besieging French lines : the Portuguese cavalry , supported by a small group of infantrymen , feinted towards the French left wing while a strong force of 5 @,@ 000 men attacked the right . The Spaniards under de España drove through the first French parallel to engage one of Gen. Jean @-@ Baptiste Girard 's brigades and were only driven back when Mortier sent several battalions to his aid . De España pulled back to Badajoz , having lost 650 men and causing 400 French casualties . 
 On 9 February Mendizabal withdrew most of his men from Badajoz , leaving behind a 7 @,@ 000 @-@ strong garrison . The field army 's 9 @,@ 000 infantry settled on the heights of San Cristóbal while the 3 @,@ 000 horse encamped behind them on the plains of the <unk> . The Spanish commander again ignored Wellington 's plan , failing to dig entrenchments on the heights , nor did he send out a cavalry screen to protect his front and monitor the French movements . Soult , however , largely ignored the Spanish army for the next few days , concentrating instead on building up his siege lines and battering Badajoz . Heavy rains also flooded both the Guadiana and Gebora rivers , rendering them impassable , so that between 11 – 18 February the French were only able to shell the southern end of the Spanish line , pushing the Spaniards further away from Badajoz and the protection of the San Cristóbal fort . 
 = = Battle = = 
 By the afternoon of 18 February , the rains had abated and lower water levels made the Gebora River fordable again . That evening Soult sent nine infantry battalions , three cavalry squadrons and two artillery batteries , under Mortier 's command , to the north bank across a flying bridge over the Guadiana River . Joined by six cavalry regiments under Latour @-@ Maubourg , the French now had 4 @,@ 500 infantrymen , 2 @,@ 500 cavalry and 12 cannon ready to attack the Spanish lines at dawn on 19 February . Due to heavy fog that morning , Mendizabal was unaware of the approaching French until his picket , only a mile from his front , was driven back by Mortier 's infantry fording the Gebora . At the same time the 2nd Hussars , sent by Latour @-@ Maubourg to turn the Spanish left flank , had managed to climb the heights to the north , also undetected , and fell upon one of de España 's unsuspecting regiments . 
 Mortier demonstrated his tactical prowess in the deployment of his small force : he sent all his cavalry to the north to attack the Spanish left ; three battalions were sent south between the fort at San Cristóbal and the Spanish right wing ; and his remaining six infantry battalions assaulted the Spanish front . As the fog rose , the French light cavalry under Briche gained the heights and fell upon the Spanish left flank , while Latour @-@ Maubourg took three dragoon regiments to attack the combined Spanish and Portuguese cavalry on the plains of the <unk> . Despite outnumbering the French , the Allied horse ignored orders and immediately fled towards Elvas and Campo Maior . They escaped unscathed , largely because Latour @-@ Maubourg ignored them and instead launched his cavalry against the Spanish infantry line . 
 The engagement of the Spanish right flank was not as immediately decisive . Because the fog had lifted , the Spaniards could see the numerical weakness of the opposing force and formed up with little sign of falling . The musketry duel between the two sides had scarcely begun , however , when the French cavalry appeared ; the light horse approached along the top of the heights while Latour @-@ Maubourg 's dragoons advanced from the rear . In response , Mendizabal formed his troops into two huge divisional squares supported by artillery which , although initially successful in impeding the French cavalry , eventually became an easy target for the French infantry and artillery . As one Spanish infantryman recounted , " Their artillery played upon it in a most horrible fashion until it became first an oval and then an unformed mass that the cavalry were able to penetrate and take prisoner . " Briche 's light cavalry thus broke through the two Spanish squares without great difficulty , and the battle was effectively over . A few of the Spanish regiments dispersed ; many surrendered ; and others joined together to fight their way to Badajoz or the Portuguese border . 
 = = Consequences = = 
 The battle was a serious setback for the Anglo @-@ Spanish @-@ Portuguese allies ; Wellington had earlier warned the Spanish generals that the Army of Extremadura was " the last body of troops which their country possesses " , and later wrote that " [ t ] he defeat of Mendizabal is the greatest misfortune , which was not previously expected , that has yet occurred to us . " The army had been essentially destroyed ; although 2 @,@ 500 infantry had escaped into Badajoz — and a slightly smaller number to Portugal — about 1 @,@ 000 Spaniards had been killed or wounded , 4 @,@ 000 were taken prisoner and 17 cannon had been lost . The French , for their part , suffered only minor casualties . Soult initially reported his losses as 30 killed and 140 wounded , but those figures were eventually revised to around 400 casualties , mainly from the cavalry . 
 Soult was now free to continue his investment of Badajoz ; although the town 's garrison was now some 8 @,@ 000 strong due to the influx of soldiers from Mendizabal 's destroyed army , it eventually fell to the French on 11 March . Wellington then sent a large Anglo @-@ Portuguese corps , commanded by Sir William Beresford , to retake the important fortress town , and by 20 April the second siege of Badajoz had begun . A French attempt to lift this siege resulted , on 16 May , in the bloody Battle of Albuera , in which Beresford 's strong Allied corps maintained the siege but only barely managed to hold off an outnumbered French army , again commanded by Soult . However , when the French Army of Portugal , now under the command of Marshal Auguste Marmont , and the Army of the South converged , the combined French force of over 60 @,@ 000 men forced Wellington , on 20 June , to call off the siege and pull his 44 @,@ 000 @-@ man besieging army back to Elvas . Thus Badajoz would remain in French hands until the following year , when the Allies finally retook it following the Battle of Badajoz . 
 = Battle of Mughar Ridge = 
 The Battle of Mughar Ridge , officially known by the British as the Action of El Mughar , took place on 13 November 1917 during the Pursuit phase of the Southern Palestine Offensive of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in the First World War . Fighting between the advancing Egyptian Expeditionary Force ( EEF ) and the retreating Yildirim Army Group , occurred after the Battle of Beersheba and the Third Battle of Gaza . Operations occurred over an extensive area north of the Gaza to Beersheba line and west of the road from Beersheba to Jerusalem via Hebron . 
 Strong Ottoman Army positions from Gaza to the foothills of the Judean Hills had successfully held out against British Empire forces for a week after the Ottoman army was defeated at Beersheba . But the next day , 8 November , the main Ottoman base at Sheria was captured after two days ' fighting and a British Yeomanry cavalry charge at Huj captured guns ; Ottoman units along the whole line were in retreat . 
 The XXI Corps and Desert Mounted Corps attacked the Ottoman Eighth Army on an extended front from the Judean foothills across the Mediterranean coastal plain from 10 to 14 November . Beginning on 10 November at Summil , an Ottoman counterattack by the Seventh Army was eventually blocked by mounted units while on 13 November in the centre a cavalry charge assisted by infantry captured two fortified villages and on 14 November , to the north at Ayun Kara an Ottoman rearguard position was successfully attacked by mounted units . Junction Station ( also known as Wadi es Sara ) was captured and the Ottoman railway link with Jerusalem was cut . As a result of this victory the Ottoman Eighth Army withdrew behind the Nahr el Auja and their Seventh Army withdrew toward Jerusalem . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the capture of Beersheba on 31 October , from 1 to 7 November , strong Ottoman rearguard units at Tel el Khuweilfe in the southern Judean Hills , at Hareira and Sheria on the maritime plain , and at Gaza close to the Mediterranean coast , held the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in heavy fighting . During this time the Ottoman Army was able to withdraw in good order ; the rearguard garrisons retiring under cover of darkness during the night of 8 / 9 November 1917 . 
 The delay caused by these rearguards may have seriously compromised the British Empire advance as there was not much time to conclude military engagements in southern Palestine . The winter rains were expected to start in the middle of the month and the black soil plain which was currently firm , facilitating the movements of large military units would with the rains become a giant boggy quagmire , impassable for wheeled vehicles and very heavy marching for infantry . With the rains the temperatures which were currently hot during the day and pleasant at night would drop rapidly to become <unk> cold . In 1917 the rains began on 19 November just as the infantry began their advance into the Judean Hills . 
 The strength of the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies , before the attack at Beersheba on 31 October , was estimated to have been 45 @,@ 000 rifles , 1 @,@ 500 sabres and 300 guns . This force had been made up of the Seventh Army 's incomplete III Corps . The III Corps ' 24th Infantry Division was at <unk> ( near Hareira – Sheria ) and its 27th Infantry Division was at Beersheba . Its 3rd Cavalry Division , as well as the 16th , 19th , and 24th Infantry Divisions were also in the area to the east of the Gaza – Beersheba line . The Seventh Army was commanded by Fevzi <unk> . The Eighth Army 's XXII Corps ( 3rd and 53rd Infantry Divisions ) was based at Gaza while its XX Corps ( 16th , 26th and 54th Infantry Divisions ) was based at Sheria in the centre of the Gaza – Beersheba line . Supporting these two corps had been two reserve divisions ; the 7th and 19th Infantry Divisions . The Eighth Army was commanded by Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein and at that time had an estimated 2 @,@ 894 officers ; 69 @,@ 709 men ; 29 @,@ 116 rifles ; 403 machine @-@ guns and 268 guns . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 During 7 – 8 November rearguards of the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies delayed the advance of Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel 's Desert Mounted Corps , Major General Edmund <unk> @-@ Smith 's ( or Major General J. Hill 's ) 52nd ( Lowland ) Division , and Major General Philip C Palin 's 75th Division . The Desert Mounted Corps consisted of the Anzac Mounted Division ( Major General Edward Chaytor ) , the Australian Mounted Division ( Major General Henry W Hodgson ) and the Yeomanry Mounted Division ( Major General George Barrow ) . The 52nd ( Lowland ) Division and 75th Division formed part of Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin 's XXI Corps . 
 On the coast the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division was fought a fierce action after crossing the Wadi el Hesi on the coast north of Gaza . By the morning of 8 November , two infantry brigades had crossed the Wadi el Hesi near its mouth and , despite some opposition established themselves on the sand dunes to the north towards <unk> . Sausage Ridge , on their right stretched from <unk> to Deir <unk> , was held in considerable strength , as the ridge covered the road and railway from Gaza to the north . During the afternoon the 155th Brigade moved to attack Sausage Ridge , but it was threatened by a counterattack on the left forcing , the brigade to halt and face north to meet this attack . When the 156th Brigade arrived from Sh . <unk> on the Wadi el Hesi , the 157th Brigade attacked the southern portion of the ridge , and gained a footing as darkness fell . They lost this precarious position four times to fierce Ottoman counterattacks , before strongly attacking and throwing the defenders off the ridge by 21 : 00 . The two attacking brigades lost 700 men in this action . 
 The Ottoman rearguards were able to safely get away during the night of the 8 / 9 November , but during the following day the only infantry unit capable of advancing was the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division 's 156th ( Scottish Rifles ) Brigade , commanded by Brigadier General Archibald Herbert Leggett . The division 's other brigades were regrouping after the fierce fighting at the Wadi Hesi . The brigade moved to Ashkelon , which was found to be deserted . By evening advance troops had pressed on to Al @-@ Majdal , 16 miles ( 26 km ) from Gaza , where they secured abandoned stores and water . By 9 November the Eighth Army had retreated 20 miles ( 32 km ) while the Seventh Army " had lost hardly any ground . " 
 Most of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force 's infantry divisions were at the end of their lines of communication and were not able to follow up the Ottoman withdrawal . XXI Corps 's 54th ( East Anglian ) Division was forced to rest at Gaza and the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade at Beit Hanun . In the rear , Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode 's XX Corps had transferred its transport to XXI Corps . XX Corps 's 60th ( 2 / 2nd London ) Division ( Major General John Shea ) was resting at Huj and its 10th ( Irish ) ( Major General John Longley ) and 74th ( Yeomanry ) ( Major General Eric Girdwood ) Divisions were at Karm . The only units in the field were the 53rd ( Welsh ) Division ( Major General S. F. Mott ) , corps cavalry , the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade , deployed in the front line near Tel el Khuweilfe in the foothills of the Judean Hills north of Beersheba . 
 Allenby wrote on 8 November : The battle is in full swing . We have driven the Turks N. and N.E. and my pursuing troops are ten miles beyond Gaza , and travelling fast . A lot of Turks are cut off – just N.E. of Gaza . I don 't know if they will be caught ; but there is no time to waste in catching them . They pooped off a huge explosion this morning – presumably ammunition . My army is all over the place , now on a front of 35 miles ... My flying men are having the time of their lives ; bombing and machine gunning the retreating columns ... I fancy that Kress von Kressenstein is nearing the Jaffa @-@ Jerusalem line , himself . 
 = = = Mounted troop movements on 9 November = = = 
 Chaytor 's Anzac Mounted Division moved off across the maritime plain towards the coast soon after daylight on 9 November , having watered their horses the previous evening . The advance was led by two brigades — on the left the 1st Light Horse Brigade and on the right the 2nd Light Horse Brigade rode in line , each responsible for their own front and outer flanks ; the attached 7th Mounted Brigade formed a reserve . 
 By about 08 : 30 the 1st Light Horse Brigade had entered Bureir and around an hour later the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was approaching Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein 's Eighth Army headquarters at <unk> . Here Ottoman soldiers were discovered to be occupying a strong position on high ground north @-@ west of the village ; the brigade made a dismounted attack capturing 600 prisoners along with large amounts of supplies , materiel and an abandoned German field hospital . At midday El Mejdel , 13 miles ( 21 km ) north @-@ east of Gaza , was occupied with little difficulty by the 1st Light Horse Brigade , who captured 170 prisoners and found a good well with a steam pump enabling the brigade to water all horses expeditiously . After passing the ancient town of Ashkelon a message was received from the Desert Mounted Corps notifying the Anzac Mounted Division that the British XXI Corps were marching towards El Mejdel and Julis . The main Ottoman road and railway leading north from Gaza were both cut and as a consequence , Chauvel ordered the division to advance towards Bayt Daras . The division duly turned north @-@ east with the 1st Light Horse Brigade entering Isdud close to the Mediterranean Sea . On the right , the 2nd Light Horse Brigade captured the villages of Suafir el <unk> and Arak <unk> , a convoy and its escort ( some 350 prisoners ) . While the brigade was reorganising , Ottoman guns further north opened fire , shelling both captors and captives alike . Just before dark the 2nd Light Horse Brigade captured a further 200 prisoners . The Anzac Mounted Division took up a night battle outpost line along high ground south of the Wadi <unk> , from near Isdud to Arak <unk> . 
 During its journey across the maritime plain to Isdud , the Anzac Mounted Division captured many prisoners but met no large organised Ottoman force . As the day progressed , the captured Ottoman units were found to be increasingly disorganised with many soldiers suffering severely from thirst and exhaustion and some from dysentery . 
 Allenby wrote on 9 November : Things are going well . I have infantry already in <unk> , and am pushing N. , inland of that place . I know of 77 guns having been taken ; and 5 @,@ 000 prisoners at least . I went to Gaza , this afternoon ... [ it ] was taken by Bulfin , quite easily . The attack , on the 6th inst . , went with such a rush that Gaza became untenable . Tomorrow is likely to be a critical day , in our pursuit . If the Turks can 't stop us tomorrow , they are done . 
 Meanwhile , Hodgson 's Australian Mounted Division , spent most of 9 November searching for water , which was eventually found at Huj . After most of the horses had been watered , they advanced 16 miles ( 26 km ) to the <unk> – Isdud line capturing prisoners , guns , and transports on the way . This march during the night of 9 / 10 November was the only night march made through Ottoman territory of the campaign . 
 The Australian Mounted Division was led by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade as advanced guard , with an artillery battery attached . The 5th Mounted Brigade , two squadrons of which had made the charge at Huj the day before , followed , with the 4th Light Horse Brigade forming the rearguard . To ensure the division maintained its cohesion throughout the night , the advance guard placed pickets along the route every 440 yards ( 400 m ) . These were picked up by the following units which in turn dropped pickets to be gathered up by the rearguard . Corps headquarters in the rear was kept informed of the division 's movement by signal lamp . Signallers from the two leading brigades intermittently flashed the letters of the divisional call signal in a south @-@ westerly direction from every prominent hilltop along the route . These arrangements worked well and the division arrived intact in the vicinity of Arak el Menshiye and Al @-@ Faluja . 
 The Australian Mounted Division was followed by the 4th Light Horse Brigade Field Ambulance and the divisional train made up of brigade transport and supply sections carrying rations . The field ambulance set up a dressing station and treated about 40 wounded men before moving through Huj at 16 : 00 . After encountering rugged mountainous ravines and 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) of very rough terrain , at around midnight they set up camp in a wadi bed . 
 The Yeomanry Mounted Division , ( Barrow ) , had been in hills north of Beersheba fighting in the line at Tel el Khuweilfe with infantry from the 53rd ( Welsh ) Division , the 1 / 2nd County of London Yeomanry Regiment ( XX Corps , Corps Troops ) and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade until Allenby ordered it to rejoin the Desert Mounted Corps , 20 miles ( 32 km ) away on the coast . Meanwhile , the infantry from the 60th ( 2 / 2nd London ) Division marched to Huj during the afternoon of 9 November , obtaining water there . Infantry in the 10th ( Irish ) and 74th ( Yeomanry ) Divisions remained at Karm .

 The 52nd ( Lowland ) Division had ended the possibility of an Ottoman stand on the Wadi Hesi and the next natural defensive line was 7 – 15 miles ( 11 – 24 km ) to the north , on the Nahr Sukereir . Allenby had issued orders on 9 November to advance to El Tineh – Beit Duras in an attempt to turn the Ottoman Nahr Sukereir line before it could be firmly established . Meanwhile , disorganised and demoralised Ottoman columns were harassed as they retreated by the Royal Flying Corps dropping bombs and firing machine @-@ guns . Aircraft also dropped bombs on El Tineh railway station and detonated the ammunition depot . By 10 November infantry in the 52nd ( Lowland ) and 75th Divisions had advanced to the line Beit Duras – Isdud with the leading brigade of the 52nd Division successfully attacking a strong Ottoman rearguard defending Isdud . 
 Despite these difficulties the Ottoman Army successfully carried out a difficult retreat to establish a new defensive position on an extensive and well chosen position . The new line stretched about 20 miles ( 32 km ) west to east from the mouth of the Nahr Sukereir on the Mediterranean Sea to Bayt Jibrin not far from Tel el Khuweilfe in the Judean Hills . The Ottoman Eighth Army on the coastal sector was still retreating when ordered to form the new line along the north side of the valley of the Nahr Sukereir , more than 25 miles ( 40 km ) from Gaza . Further inland the Ottoman Seventh Army was in relatively good condition having retired 10 miles ( 16 km ) or so without interference and was preparing to launch a counterattack . 
 Reinforcements , transport and supplies were not a problem for these two Ottoman armies as they were falling back on their lines of communication . Their defensive line ran more or less parallel to and 10 miles ( 16 km ) or so in front of both road links and the railway . The Jaffa to Jerusalem railway , with connections northwards to Damascus and Istanbul , had a line branching southwards to El Tineh which branched again to Gaza and Beersheba . These lines could still be used to transport supplies and reinforcements quickly and efficiently to the Ottoman Army 's front line . Indeed , a general strengthening of resistance along the Wadi Sukereir line was concentrated around Qastina , towards which the 2nd Light Horse Brigade advanced , capturing a refugee column between Suafir and Qastina .

 The series of engagements leading up to the Battle of Mughar Ridge began on 10 November near Isdud . The leading brigade of the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division , the 156th ( Scottish Rifles ) Brigade , advanced 15 miles ( 24 km ) despite encountering stiff Ottoman resistance around Isdud and was subjected to artillery bombardment from across the Nahr Sukereir . Two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division followed the 156th ( Scottish Rifles ) Brigade pushing across the Nahr Sukereir at Jisr <unk> , to Hamama . Here they successfully established a bridgehead on the Ottoman right flank . Ample water was found and the bridgehead was enlarged the following day .

 The Australian Mounted Division , which had left Huj after dark on the night of 9 / 10 November bound for Tel el Hesi , arrived there at 04 : 30 . They halted until dawn on 10 November when several large pools of good water were found in the wadi . These allowed the horses to drink their fill — some that had missed out on watering before the trek , had been without water for three days and four nights . The division then came up into position on the right . The Anzac Mounted Division reported on the morning of 10 November that the division was " ridden out " and had to halt for water . 
 Meanwhile , the 12th Light Horse Regiment ( 4th Light Horse Brigade ) advanced north from <unk> to Al @-@ Faluja arriving at 24 : 00 on 9 / 10 November when engineering stores and five burnt out aircraft were captured . The 4th Light Horse Brigade was ordered at 10 : 40 on 10 November to threaten the Ottoman force opposing 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the Menshiye – Al Faluja line . Between 08 : 00 and 10 : 30 , the 3rd Light Horse Brigade had occupied the Arak el Menshiye Station while the 4th Light Horse Brigade entered Al @-@ Faluja 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) to the north @-@ west . 
 The Australian Mounted Division was joined a few hours later by the Yeomanry Mounted Division which had left Huj early in the morning . They came up on the right of the Australian Mounted Division and took over Arak el Menshiye extending the line a little further east . By the afternoon of 10 November the whole of the Desert Mounted Corps with the exception of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade , ( still at Tel el Khuweilfe ) were in line from a point a little east of Arak el Menshiye to the sea . Both the Australian and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions reconnoitred the left half of the Ottoman line running from Qastina , roughly through Balin and Barqusya , to the neighbourhood of Bayt Jibrin in the foot hills of the Judean Hills . 
 Chauvel ordered the Yeomanry Mounted Division to move westward to the coast leaving the Australian Mounted Division on the right flank . Neither he nor Hodgson commanding the Australian Mounted Division were aware at that time , that the division was threatened by three or four Ottoman Eighth Army infantry divisions . The 16th and 26th Divisions ( XX Corps ) and the 53rd Division ( XXII Corps ) were holding a 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) line between the railway line and Bayt Jibrin , all more or less reorganised and all within striking distance . However , Chauvel 's reliance on the steadiness of the Australian Mounted Division was fully justified . With its headquarters at Al @-@ Faluja on 10 and 11 November , the Australian Mounted Division became engaged ( during 10 November ) in stubborn fighting . 
 Ottoman trenches had been dug from Summil 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) north of Arak el Menshiye to Zeita , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) to the north @-@ east , and to the east of the railway line . The three brigades of the Australian Mounted Division ran into this Ottoman rearguard 's left flank near the village of Summil . Ottoman forces were advancing from Summil by 12 : 55 and the 4th Light Horse Brigade was deployed to attack them with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade assisting . At 14 : 55 patrols reported strong Ottoman positions along the Zeita – Summil – Barqusya line with trenches extending west of Summil village . Two Ottoman guns were seen being placed in a well @-@ sited position with no cover for 3 @,@ 000 yards ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) in front , which would require a long dismounted attack . By 15 : 30 the 4th Light Horse Brigade was approaching Summil when ordered to attack from the north with the 5th Mounted Brigade supported by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade threatening Summil from the west . By 16 : 30 3rd Light Horse Brigade headquarters were established 870 yards ( 800 m ) south @-@ east of Al @-@ Faluja on the railway line , but owing to darkness at 17 : 15 the attack was not developed and night battle outpost lines were established at 20 : 00 . By 18 : 00 the 4th Light Horse Brigade was holding a line linking to the Anzac Mounted Division at Beit <unk> , while the Ottomans were holding a ridge near Barqusya with three cavalry troops , three guns and about 1 @,@ 500 infantry . The mounted infantry and cavalry brigades were unable to advance further due to intense Ottoman artillery fire which continued throughout the day . However , Summil was occupied unopposed , during the morning of 11 November . 
 The 4th Light Horse Brigade casualties were one other rank killed , one officer and nine other ranks wounded . These wounded soldiers were probably treated by the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance which was in the field a couple of miles past Al @-@ Faluja . The ambulance had itself suffered two casualties when subjected to artillery fire from the hills . But they halted and put up a tent and after dark took in eight more patients all hit by high @-@ explosive shells from the 4th Light Horse Regiment . They were busy until midnight ; two seriously wounded soldiers being evacuated to a Casualty Clearing Station and the rest were kept till morning . 
 My infantry have , on the coast , got 10 miles N. of <unk> ; and my Cavalry , further inland , are ahead of them . The mounted troops took some 15 guns and 700 prisoners yesterday ... This afternoon I went to Khan Yunis and told the head men that they could now go out of the town , to their farms and gardens ... The villagers – some 9000 – have been kept in , by wired enclosures , up to now as the Turks had agents there , and many warm sympathizers . 
 = = = Position on 11 November = = = 
 Allenby decided that an advance on Junction Station could most easily be made from the south @-@ west , by turning the Ottoman Army 's right flank on the coast . The 11 and 12 November were days of preparation for battle the following day . The Anzac Mounted Division were resting at Hamama when their supporting Australian Army Service Corps personnel caught up and distributed supplies for man and horse . This task was performed by " B " echelon wagons of brigades ' transport and supply sections forming an improvised Anzac Divisional Train . It was here also that the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade rejoined the division at 23 : 00 on 12 November . 
 Supplies for the advance were transported over land and by sea but it was only with great difficulty that two infantry divisions of XXI Corps and three mounted divisions of Desert Mounted Corps were maintained in the advance at such distances from base . The Navy transported stores to the mouths of the Wadi Hesi and the Nahr <unk> as these lines were secured . The railhead was being pushed forward as rapidly as possible , but did not reach Deir <unk> until 28 November . So it was a considerable distance over which the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps worked to bring up supplies . 
 The Australian Mounted Division occupied Summil unopposed at dawn on 11 November but was unable to advance in the face of gathering opposition from the immediate north @-@ east . Summil had been found deserted at 06 : 00 by patrols of 3rd Light Horse Brigade ( Australian Mounted Division ) . But by 09 : 30 the 10th Light Horse Regiment ( 3rd Light Horse Brigade ) reported Ottoman units in strength , holding a high ridge 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) north @-@ east of the town . At the same time Ottoman field guns began shelling Summil from a position on high ground about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of the town . Following instructions from Australian Mounted Division received at 14 : 00 , the 10th Light Horse Regiment carried out active patrolling . They made themselves as conspicuous as possible without becoming seriously engaged while the remainder of the division advanced north . 
 The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was ordered to rejoin the Anzac Mounted Division . The brigade left Beersheba at 16 : 30 on 11 November and made a forced march of 52 miles ( 84 km ) . Their Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment , which had been in the front line with the 53rd ( Welsh ) Division about Tel el Khuweilfe in the southern Judean Hills not far from Hebron , made a forced march of 62 miles ( 100 km ) . These treks were estimated to have taken 181 ⁄ 2 hours , with a halt to rest and water at Kh . <unk> early on 12 November . They arrived at Hamama that night at 23 : 00 some 30 and 1 / 2 hours later .

 The 20 miles ( 32 km ) defensive line , chosen by the Ottoman commanders to rally their 20 @,@ 000 @-@ strong army and stop the invasion , was also designed to protect the Jaffa to Jerusalem railway and the threatened Junction Station . Their choice of position was partly dictated by pressure from the British , Australian , Indian and New Zealand advance , and partly by the terrain . The line north of the Nahr Rubin ran nearly north – south and parallel to , but about 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) to the west of the railway line branching southwards . It ran along a high steep ridge connecting the hillside villages of Al @-@ Maghar and Zernukah ( surrounded by cactus hedges ) and extended north @-@ westwards to El Kubeibeh . The southern extremity of this ridge commanded the flat country to the west and south @-@ west , for a distance of 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) or more . Prisoners from almost every unit of the Ottoman Army were being captured indicating that rearguards had been driven back in on the main body of the two Ottoman armies . All along their line Ottoman resistance grew noticeably stronger . 
 The Ottoman line was defended by the Eighth Army 's 3rd Division ( XXII Corps ) to the north , the 7th Division ( Eighth Army Reserve ) to the east , the 54th Division ( XX Corps ) near el Mesmiye and the 26th Division ( XX Corps ) holding Tel es Safi . Erich von Falkenhayn , the overall commander of the Ottoman Armies , had resolved to make a stand in front of Junction Station and succeeded in deploying his forces by the evening of 11 November . He ordered a counterattack against the British right flank which was covered by the Australian Mounted Division . His plan was to overwhelm them , cut their supply lines , outflank and capture all the Egyptian Expeditionary Force 's forward units . Originally ordered for 11 November it was postponed until the next day . 
 Meanwhile , Allenby 's plan for 13 November was to turn the right flank of the Ottoman line on the coast despite aircraft and cavalry reconnaissances revealing a considerable Ottoman force further inland on the Egyptian Expeditionary Force 's own right flank . He assigned the task of dealing with this immediate threat to the Australian Mounted Division , which was ordered to make as big a demonstration of their operations as possible . This would further focus Ottoman attention away from the coastal sector where the Anzac and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions would advance northwards to attempt to turn the Ottoman right flank assisted by infantry attacks on the Ottoman right centre the following day . 
 Allenby 's force was deployed with infantry from the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division and the 75th Division in the centre , the Australian Mounted Division on their right flank with the Anzac and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions on the infantry 's left flank . He ordered the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division to extend their position across the Nahr Sukereir on the Ottoman right flank . And , reinforced with two additional brigades , he ordered the Australian Mounted Division to advance towards Tel es Safi where they encountered a determined and substantial Ottoman counterattack .

 The 52nd ( Lowland ) Division was to make a preparatory attack near the coast to open the way for the attack on Junction Station the next day . They were to attack north of the Nahr Sukhereir between the villages of Burqa and Yazur with the Yeomanry Mounted Division acting as flank guard . Their objective was an important Ottoman rearguard position which ran from the village of Burqa to Brown Hill . While the village was easily taken it was necessary to make an extremely difficult attack on the steep sided Brown Hill . The hill was topped by a large cairn and commanded a long field of fire over the plain southwards across the Nahr Sukhereir . By the time a battalion of the 156th Brigade , covered by two batteries of the 264th Brigade Royal Field Artillery and the South African Field Artillery Brigade of 75th Division , captured the crest it had been reduced to a handful of men . But just 20 minutes after taking Brown Hill the remnants of the Scots battalion ( now down to just one officer and about 100 men ) was unable to withstand an Ottoman counterattack and was driven off after a fierce struggle at close quarters . 
 The 2 / 3rd Gurkha Rifles were then ordered to renew the attack at dusk . Owing to poor light , the artillery was no longer able to give much assistance , but nevertheless the Gurkhas quickly retook the hill with a bayonet charge , suffering 50 casualties , and in the process recovering two Lewis guns . The attacking battalion suffered over 400 killed or wounded , while the defending Ottoman 7th Division must have also suffered heavy casualties ; 170 dead Ottoman soldiers were found on the battlefield . The fighting here has been described as equal to the 157th ( Highland Light Infantry ) Brigade 's encounter at Sausage Ridge on 8 November . The success of these operations north of the Nahr Sukhereir opened the way for the main attacks the following day , on the Ottoman armies ' front line positions .

 Meanwhile , the Australian Mounted Division advanced in the direction of Tel es Safi to press the left flank of the Ottoman forces as strongly as possible . About 4 @,@ 000 Australian and British mounted troops of 3rd and 4th Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades moved northwards in a conspicuous demonstration of aggression . At first it appeared that the Ottoman formations had retired altogether ; the 9th Light Horse Regiment ( 3rd Light Horse Brigade ) rode through Barqusya , one troop pressing on to occupy Tel es Safi . The 5th Mounted Brigade also found Balin unoccupied , and rapidly advanced northwards towards Tel es Safi and <unk> . By 12 : 00 the Australian Mounted Division was spread over at least 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) facing the north and east when four divisions of the Ottoman 7th Army ( about 5 @,@ 000 soldiers ) began their advance southwards from the railway . 
 The Ottoman infantry divisions began moving south from El Tineh 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of Qastina from the Ottoman controlled branch line of the railway line running southwards in the direction of Huj . Here and further north along the railway trains were stopping to allow huge numbers of troops to take to the field . Soon after the 11th Light Horse Regiment ( 4th Light Horse Brigade ) was forced to retire from Qastina as Ottoman units occupied the place in strength . Then at 12 : 00 three separate columns ( of all arms ) were seen advancing towards Tel es Safi from the north and north @-@ east . Ten minutes later the British Honourable Artillery Company battery opened fire , but was hopelessly out shot , outnumbered , and out ranged by Ottoman guns of greater power and weight . 
 The approach of the Eighth Ottoman Army 's XX Corps ( 16th , 26th 53rd and 54th Divisions ) was at first unknown to the 5th Mounted Brigade in Balin . But at about 13 : 00 a force estimated at 5 @,@ 000 Ottoman soldiers suddenly attacked and almost surrounded the mounted brigade . The attack was made by two Ottoman columns , one coming down the track from Junction Station to Tel el Safi and the other by rail to El Tineh Station . It was by far the heaviest counterattack experienced since the break through by the Egyptian Expeditionary Force at Sharia on 7 November . The Royal Gloucestershire Hussars and Warwickshire Yeomanry regiments of 5th Mounted Brigade , were pushed back out of Balin before being reinforced by the Worcestershire Yeomanry . The 3rd Light Horse Brigade was sent up at a canter from Summil , followed by the remaining two batteries of the Australian Mounted Division . One light horse regiment occupied <unk> but was forced to retire by an attack from a very strong Ottoman force supported by heavy artillery fire from several batteries . All available troops of the Australian Mounted Division were now engaged and the Ottoman attack continued to be pressed . The counterattack forced the mounted division to concede the territory gained during the day , before fighting the Ottoman Army to a standstill in front of Summil . 
 The 4th Light Horse Brigade could render no effective aid to the 3rd Light Horse or the 5th Mounted Yeomanry brigades . It was strung out to the west as far as the Dayr <unk> railway line and was being heavily attacked . Ottoman units managed to advance to within 100 yards ( 91 m ) of the 4th Light Horse Brigade 's position ; only at the end of the day was this strong Ottoman attack repulsed by machine @-@ gun and rifle fire . Hodgson ( commander of the Australian Mounted Division ) ordered a slow withdrawal by 3rd Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades to high ground on the line Bir Summil – Khurbet <unk> . The order had only just been given when another Ottoman train was sighted moving to the south . It stopped west of Balin and <unk> a fresh force of Ottoman soldiers who deployed rapidly to advance against the left flank of the 5th Mounted Brigade . Two batteries of Australian Mounted Division were in action on the high ground north @-@ west of Summeil firing on this fresh Ottoman force moving over the open plain in full view of the gunners . The artillery fire was so effective the attacking Ottoman advance was halted , forcing them to fall back a little where they dug trenches . Fighting steadily and withdrawing skilfully , the 3rd Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades had reached the edge of Summil village where the Ottoman attack was finally held . The attack ended at 18 : 00 in darkness . 
 The Ottoman attackers dug themselves in on a line through Balin and <unk> while the line taken up by the Australian Mounted Division began with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade facing east on a line running due north from about half way between Iraq el Menshiye and Summil . The line then turned westward so the 5th Mounted Brigade faced northwards in front of Summil with the 4th Light Horse Brigade to their left in front of <unk> and connecting with the right of the infantry division ; the 75th Division at Suafir esh <unk> . A critical situation created by the strong Ottoman attacking forces had been controlled by the coolness and steadiness of the troops , especially the machine @-@ gun squadrons of the 5th Mounted and the 4th Light Horse Brigades . The Australian Mounted Division suffered about 50 casualties mainly from the 5th Mounted Brigade . 
 To the east von Falkenhayn , held his reserve force of 3rd Cavalry Division ( Seventh Army 's III Corps ) and 19th Division ( Eighth Army reserve ) in front of Beit Jibrin . They waited throughout the day for the main attack to make progress before beginning their own advance , but the opportunity never eventuated . This powerful Ottoman counterattack had been contained and had not forced any rearrangement of the invading forces , whose preparations and concentration on the plain were now complete . But von Falkenhayn was forced to halt his Seventh Army 's attack and then to take away from it the 16th Division plus one regiment .

 In southern Palestine the wet season was approaching with another thunderstorm and heavy rain on the night of 11 November . The dark cotton soil over which the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was now advancing would not need much more rain to turn it into impassable mud . But 12 November had been fine and the roads had dried out . The rolling maritime plain was dotted with villages on low hill tops surrounded by groves and orchards . These were in turn surrounded by hedges of prickly pear or cactus , making them strong natural places of defence . In the distance to the right the spurs and valleys of the Judean Hills were visible even to the invading British Empire troops near the Mediterranean coast . On 13 November the weather was clear and fine with at first no sign of the Ottoman Army . 
 The 20 @,@ 000 @-@ strong Ottoman force was deployed to defend the Jaffa to Jerusalem railway along the Wadi al @-@ <unk> and Al @-@ Nabi Rubin . The battlefield was generally cultivated but with winter approaching it was bare and open . Its most prominent feature , the 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) high ridge which continues north towards Zernukah and El Kubeibeh formed the backbone of the Ottoman Army 's 20 @-@ mile ( 32 km ) long defensive position . The naturally strong Ottoman line was defended by the Eighth Army 's 3rd Division ( XXII Corps ) to the north , the 7th Division ( Eighth Army Reserve ) to the east , the 54th Division ( XX Corps ) near el Mesmiye and the 26th Division ( XX Corps ) holding Tel es Safi . Benefiting from the terrain two strong defensive positions with commanding views of the countryside were located on the ridge . They were the villages of Qatra and Al @-@ Maghar . These villages were separated by the Wadi Jamus which links the Wadi al @-@ <unk> with the Nahr Rubin . 
 While the Ottoman counterattack had been in progress on 12 November , Allenby issued orders for the attack on 13 November to the commanders of XXI Corps and Desert Mounted Corps at the latter 's headquarters near Julis . The main attack was to be carried out by the XXI Corps ' 52nd ( Lowland ) and 75th Divisions westwards towards Junction Station between the Gaza road on the right , and El Mughar on the left . On the right flank of the XXI Corps the Australian Mounted Division 's 3rd and 4th Light Horse and 5th Mounted Brigades , reinforced by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade ( Anzac Mounted Division ) , the 7th Mounted Brigade ( Yeomanry Mounted Division ) and two cars of the 12th LAM Battery , would attack in line advancing northwards towards Junction Station . The remainder of Desert Mounted Corps ; the Anzac and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions would cover the left flank of XXI Corps , with Yibna as their first objective and Aqir the second . As soon as Junction Station was captured they were to swing north to occupy Ramla and Lod and reconnoitre towards Jaffa . 
 = = = In the centre = = = 
 During the first phase of the attack by infantry in the 75th Division ( XXI Corps ) were to capture the line Tel el <unk> – Qastina – Yazur and then seize Mesmiye . On their left infantry in the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division were to secure the line Yazur – <unk> and then seize Qatra . After a pause for the artillery to be brought forward , the second phase attacks on the final objectives of Junction Station for the 75th and al @-@ <unk> for the 52nd ( Lowland ) Divisions were to be made . The first phase was due to start at 08 : 00 hours on 13 November preceded by one hour 's bombardment . 
 By 10 : 00 the 2 / 4th Somerset Light Infantry , 1 / 5th Devonshire Regiment , 2 / 5th Hampshire Regiment , 1 / 4th Wiltshire Regiment , 2 / 3rd and 3 / 3rd Gurkha Rifles ( from the 232nd and the 233rd Brigades , 75th Division ) were advancing along the main road . They occupied the undefended villages of Tall al @-@ <unk> , Qastina and Yazur . The 52nd ( Lowland ) Division had already occupied <unk> . The 75th Division proceeded to attack Mesmiye on a lower and southward extension of the ridge on which Qatra and el Mughar were situated with the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division attacking directly towards these two villages . But these attacks were held up by very strong Ottoman defences . 
 At Mesmiye the Ottoman Army was strongly posted on high ground in and near the village , and well @-@ sited machine @-@ guns swept all approaches . Infantry in the 75th Division made steady slow progress ; the main body of the Ottoman rear guard eventually falling back to a slight ridge 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the north @-@ east . The attack by 3 / 3rd Gurkhas and infantry in the 234th Brigade moved up to Mesmiye el <unk> and cleared the place of snipers . One company of 58th Vaughan 's Rifles suffered heavy casualties during an Ottoman attack on the flank of infantry in the 233rd Brigade . Towards dusk the final stage of the infantry assault was supported by two troops of 11th Light Horse Regiment ( 4th Light Horse Brigade ) , who galloped into action on the infantry 's right flank and gave valuable fire support . An infantry frontal attack covered by machine @-@ gun fire drove the Ottoman defenders off the ridge , enabling Mesmiye esh <unk> to be occupied soon after . With Ottoman resistance broken infantry in the 75th Division pushed on through Mesmiye where they took 300 prisoners , and although ordered to capture Junction Station they halted short of their objective in darkness . 
 = = = On the flanks = = = 
 The Australian Mounted Division covered the right flank of the infantry divisions . At 10 : 00 the 4th Light Horse Brigade moved forward but was held up by an Ottoman position covering El Tineh . The brigade was ordered at 11 : 50 to push forward to protect the right of the 233rd Brigade ( 75th Division ) as their attack had succeeded and they advanced to occupy Mesmiye . In order for the 4th Light Horse to move the 7th Mounted Brigade was ordered to relieve them in the line . At 12 : 00 troops of the 4th Light Horse Brigade entered <unk> 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) south @-@ south @-@ east of Junction Station with the 7th Mounted Brigade on its left then only .5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) from the station . By 16 : 00 the 4th Light Horse Brigade was ordered to push forward to El Tineh as the infantry advance on their left was progressing . It was occupied the following morning . 
 The Yeomanry Mounted Division , with the Anzac Mounted Division in reserve , covered the infantry 's left flank . Yibna was captured by the 8th Mounted Brigade which then advanced northwards against El Kubeibeh and Zernukah . The 22nd Mounted Brigade was held up by Ottoman units defending Aqir while the 6th Mounted Brigade ( with the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade protecting their northern flank ) was directed against el Mughar . 
 = = = Charge at El Mughar = = = 
 At about 11 : 30 two leading battalions of 155th ( South Scottish ) Brigade ( 52nd ( Lowland ) Division ) were advancing under heavy shrapnel and machine @-@ gun fire to the shelter of the Wadi Jamus about 600 yards ( 550 m ) from their objective . But every attempt to leave the wadi was stopped by very heavy fire from well placed machine @-@ guns . The reserve battalion was brought up but an attempt to work up the wadi between Qatra and El Mughar was barred by heavy machine @-@ gun fire from the villages . At about 14 : 30 it was agreed between the GOC 52nd ( Lowland ) Division and the GOC Yeomanry Mounted Division that the 6th Mounted Brigade should attack El Mughar ridge in combination with a renewed assault on Qatra and El Mughar by the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division . Half an hour later the Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry and the Queen 's Own Dorset Yeomanry , already in the Wadi Jamus , advanced in column of squadrons extended to four paces across 3 @,@ 000 yards ( 2 @.@ 7 km ) at first trotting then galloping onto the crest of the ridge . They gained the ridge but the horses were completely exhausted and could not continue the pursuit of the escaping Ottoman units down the far side . The charge cost 16 killed , 114 wounded and 265 horses ; 16 per cent of personnel and 33 per cent of horses . However , the Ottoman defenders continued to hold El Mughar village until two squadrons of the Berkshire Yeomanry of the 6th Mounted Brigade fighting dismounted , with two battalions of the 155th ( South Scottish ) Brigade ( 52nd ( Lowland ) Division ) , renewed the attack . Fighting in the village continued until 17 : 00 when they succeeded in capturing the two crucial fortified villages of Qatra and El Mughar but at a cost of 500 casualties . Two field guns and 14 machine @-@ guns were captured . The prisoners and dead amounted to 18 officers and 1 @,@ 078 other ranks and more than 2 @,@ 000 dead Ottoman soldiers . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Junction Station was occupied during the morning and during the following days other villages in the area were found to have been abandoned . 
 Units of the 75th Division supported by several armoured cars occupied Junction Station during the morning of 14 November cutting the Jaffa to Jerusalem railway . Seventeen days of operations virtually without rest , had resulted in an advance of 60 miles ( 97 km ) from Beersheba ; major and minor engagements occurring on 13 of those days . Most of the mounted units had covered at least 170 miles ( 270 km ) since 29 October 1917 capturing 5 @,@ 270 prisoners and over 60 guns and about 50 machine @-@ guns . At Junction Station two train engines and 60 trucks in the station were captured along with an undamaged and fully functioning steam pumping plant which supplied unlimited , easily accessible water . Junction Station , with its branch line running south to El Tineh and extensions southwards towards Beersheba and Gaza was an important centre for both sides ' lines of communication . 
 On 14 November at 06 : 30 4th Light Horse Brigade entered El Tineh with the rest of the Australian Mounted Division following a couple of hours later . Here good wells containing plenty of water were found but without steam pumps and so watering was not complete until 16 : 00 . The horses had done all that had been asked of them , existing during this time on only 91 ⁄ 2 lbs of grain ration ( practically no bulk food ) and scarce water while all the time carrying about 21 stone ( 290 lb ) . That they were able to carry on into the Judean Hills after only a limited period of rest established a remarkable record . Meanwhile , the Australian Mounted Divisional Supply Train followed the fighting units as closely as they could , moving out from Beersheba via Hareira and Gaza on 11 November to Isdud on 14 November ; to <unk> the day after and Junction Station on 16 November . 
 During 14 November infantry in the 52nd ( Lowland ) and 75th Divisions concentrated and reorganised their ranks . The advance was taken over by the Yeomanry Mounted Division which crossed the railway north of Junction Station and the Anzac Mounted Division which pressed the retreating Ottoman Army northwards near the coast . 
 On 14 November the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade ( commanded by Brigadier General William Meldrum ) ran into a determined and well entrenched Ottoman rearguard near Ayun Kara , which they attacked . Fierce close quarter fighting against the Ottoman 3rd Infantry Division continued during the afternoon . Although severely threatened , the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade eventually prevailed and went on to occupy Jaffa two days later .
