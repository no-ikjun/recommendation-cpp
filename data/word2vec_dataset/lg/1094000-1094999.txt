 The score to Star Trek : The Motion Picture went on to garner Goldsmith nominations for the Oscars , Golden Globe and Saturn awards . It is often regarded as one of the composer 's greatest scores and was also one of the American Film Institute 's 250 nominated scores for their top 25 American film scores . 
 = = = Sound effects = = = 
 Sound designer Frank Serafine , a longtime Star Trek fan , was invited to create the sound effects for the picture . Given access to state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art audio equipment , Serafine saw the picture as the chance to modernize outdated motion picture sound techniques with digital technology . Owing to background noise such as camera operation , much of the ambient noise or dialogue captured on set was unusable ; it was Serafine 's job to create or recreate sounds to mix back into the scenes . 
 As all the sound elements such as dubbed lines or background noise came together , they were classified into three divisions : A Effects , B Effects , and C Effects . A Effects were synthesized or acoustic sounds that were important and integral to the picture — the sound of V 'Ger 's weapon ( partly done with the Blaster Beam instrument ) for example , or Spock 's mind meld , as well as transporters , explosions , and the warp speed sound effect . B Effects consisted of minor sounds such as the clicks of switches , beeps or chimes . C Effects were subliminal sounds that set moods — crowd chatter and ambient noise . All the elements were mixed as " <unk> " to speed integration into the final sound mix . 
 When The Motion Picture was announced , many synthesizer artists submitted demo tapes to Paramount . Ramsay and Wise consulted and decided that the film should have a unique audio style ; they were particularly concerned with avoiding sounds that had become pervasive and clichéd due to repetitious use in other science fiction movies . Events such as Enterprise bridge viewscreen activation were kept silent to provide a more comfortable atmosphere . In contrast , almost every action on the Klingon bridge made noise to reflect the aliens ' harsh aesthetic . While much of the effects were created using digital synthesizers , acoustic recordings were used as well . The wormhole 's sucking sounds were created by slowing down and reversing old Paramount stock footage of a cowboy fight , while the warp acceleration " stretch " sound was built on a slowed @-@ down cymbal crash . The crew encountered difficulty in transferring the .25 inches ( 0 @.@ 64 cm ) tapes used for creating the sounds to the 35 mm film used for the final prints ; while the film was to be released with Dolby sound , Serafine found it was easier to mix the sounds without regard to format and add the specific format after , during the later transfer to 35 mm .

 According to Michele and Duncan Barrett , Roddenberry had a decidedly negative view of religion that was reflected in the Star Trek television series episodes ; in the episode " Who Mourns for Adonais ? " , for example , the god Apollo is revealed to be a fraud , an alien rather than a divine being from Earth 's past . In comparison , religious scholar Ross Kraemer says that Roddenberry " pulled his punches " regarding religion and in the television show religion was not absent but highly private . Barrett suggests that with the Star Trek feature films this attitude of not addressing religious issues shifted . 
 In the television series , little time was spent pondering the fate of the dead . In The Motion Picture , meanwhile , Decker is apparently killed in merging with V 'Ger , but Kirk wonders if they have seen the creation of a new life form . Decker and Ilia are listed as " missing in action " rather than deceased , and the lighting and effects created as a result of the merge have been described as " <unk> " and " pseudo @-@ religious " . The discussion of a new birth is framed in a reverential way . While V 'Ger is a machine of near omnipotence , according to Robert Asa the film ( along with its successor , Star Trek V : The Final Frontier ) " implicitly protest [ s ] against classical theism " . 
 = = Release = = 
 To coincide with the film 's release , Pocket Books published a novelization written by Roddenberry . The only Star Trek novel Roddenberry wrote , the book adds back story and elements that did not appear in the movie ; for example , the novelization mentions that Willard Decker is the son of Commodore Matt Decker from the original series episode " The Doomsday Machine " — a plot element intended for the Phase II television series . The novel also has a different opening scene to introduce <unk> and Kirk , concentrates in sections on Kirk 's struggle with confidence in taking command of the Enterprise again and expands on Ilia and Decker 's relationship . The <unk> spelling for the " intruder 's " name was used exclusively in the novel Roddenberry authored , from its first appearance on page 179 of the first paperback edition of the novelization through to the account on the novel 's page 241 of Kirk reading the undamaged " V @-@ G @-@ E @-@ R " letters on the fictional " Voyager 6 " space probe 's nameplate . In addition to the novel , Star Trek printed media included a coloring book , ship blueprints , and a comic book adaptation published by Marvel Comics as Marvel Super Special # 15 ( Dec. 1979 ) . Toys included action figures , ship models , and a variety of watches , phaser mockups and communicators . McDonald 's sold specially designed Star Trek Happy Meals . The marketing was part of a coordinated approach by Paramount and its parent conglomerate Gulf + Western to create a sustained Star Trek product line . The Motion Picture novel started Pocket Books ' Star Trek book franchise , which produced 18 consecutive bestsellers within a decade . 
 Owing to the rush to complete the film , The Motion Picture was never screened before test audiences , something Wise later regretted . The director carried the fresh print of the film to the world premiere , held at the K @-@ B MacArthur Theater in Washington , D.C. Roddenberry , Wise , and the principal cast attended the function , which also served as an invitational benefit for the scholarship and youth education fund of the National Space Club . While thousands of fans were expected to attend , rain reduced fan turnout to around 300 . The premiere was followed by a black @-@ tie reception at the National Air and Space Museum . More than 500 people — consisting of the cast and crew , working members of the space community , and the few " hardcore Trekkies " who could afford the $ 100 admission price — filled the museum . The film was the first major Hollywood adaptation of a television series that had been off the air for nearly a decade to retain its original principal cast .

 The Motion Picture opened in North America on December 7 , 1979 , in 859 theaters and set a box office record for highest weekend gross , making $ 11 @,@ 815 @,@ 203 in its first weekend ( generally considered to be a slow time for the movie business ) . The film beat the record set by Superman ( 1978 ) , which had opened in a similar number of theaters but had been released in late December — a busier time . The Motion Picture earned $ 17 million within a week . At its widest domestic distribution , the film was shown in 1 @,@ 002 theaters ; it grossed $ 82 @,@ 258 @,@ 456 in the United States , making it the fifth @-@ highest grossing film of 1979 in that country . Overall , the film grossed $ 139 million worldwide . The Motion Picture was nominated for three Academy Awards : Best Art Direction ( Harold Michelson , Joseph R. Jennings , Leon Harris , John Vallone and Linda <unk> ) , Best Visual Effects , and Best Original Score . 
 In the United States , the film sold the most tickets of any film in the franchise until 2009 's Star Trek , and it remains the highest @-@ grossing film of the franchise worldwide adjusted for inflation , but Paramount considered its gross disappointing compared to expectations and marketing . The Motion Picture 's budget of $ 46 million , including costs incurred during Phase II production , was the largest for any film made within the United States up to that time . David Gerrold estimated before its release that the film would have to gross two to three times its budget to be profitable for Paramount . The studio faulted Roddenberry 's script rewrites and creative direction for the plodding pace and disappointing gross . While the performance of The Motion Picture convinced the studio to back a ( cheaper ) sequel , Roddenberry was forced out of its creative control . Harve Bennett and Nicholas Meyer would produce and direct The Wrath of Khan , which received better reviews ( becoming a fan favorite ) and continued the franchise . With the successful revival of the Star Trek brand on the big screen setting an example , Hollywood increasingly turned to 1960s television series for material . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The Motion Picture met with average reviews from critics ; a 2001 retrospective for the BBC described the film as a critical failure . As of July 2016 , the film holds a 47 % rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews with the consensus stating : " Featuring a patchwork script and a dialogue @-@ heavy storyline whose biggest villain is a cloud , Star Trek : The Motion Picture is a less @-@ than @-@ auspicious debut for the franchise . " Gary Arnold and Judith Martin of The Washington Post felt that the plot was too thin to support the length of the film , although Martin felt that compared to such science @-@ fiction films as 2001 : A Space Odyssey , Star Wars and Alien , The Motion Picture 's pretense was " slightly cleverer " . Time 's Harold Livingston wrote that the film consisted of spaceships that " take an unconscionable amount of time to get anywhere , and nothing of dramatic or human interest happens along the way " . Livingston also lamented the lack of " boldly characterized " antagonists and battle scenes that made Star Wars fun ; instead , viewers were presented with lots of talk , " much of it in impenetrable spaceflight jargon " . David Denby said that the slow movement of ships through space was " no longer surprising and elegant " after films such as 2001 : A Space Odyssey , and that much of the action consisted of the crew 's reacting to things occurring on the viewscreen , which the New York Magazine critic considered to be " like watching someone else watch television " . Variety disagreed , calling the film " a search @-@ and @-@ destroy thriller that includes all of the ingredients the TV show 's fans thrive on : the philosophical dilemma wrapped in a scenario of mind control , troubles with the space ship , the dependable and understanding Kirk , the ever @-@ logical Spock , and suspenseful take with twist ending " . 
 The characters and acting received a mixed reception . Stephen Godfrey of The Globe and Mail rated their performances highly : " time has cemented Leonard Nimoy 's look of inscrutability as Mr. Spock [ ... ] DeForest Kelley as Dr. McCoy is as feisty as ever , and James Doohan as Scotty still <unk> about his engineering woes . At a basic level , their exchanges are those of an odd assortment of grumpy , middle @-@ aged men bickering about office politics . They are a relief from the stars , and a delight . " Godfrey 's only concern was that the reunion of the old cast threatened to make casual viewers who had never seen Star Trek feel like uninvited guests . Martin considered the characters more likable than those in comparable science fiction films . Conversely , Arnold felt that the acting of the main cast ( Shatner in particular ) was poor ; " Shatner portrays Kirk as such a supercilious old twit that one rather wishes he 'd been left behind that desk " , he wrote . " Shatner has perhaps the least impressive movie physique since Rod Steiger , and his acting style has begun to recall the worst of Richard Burton . " Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the actors did not have much to do in the effects @-@ driven film , and were " limited to the exchanging of meaningful glances or staring intently at television monitors , usually in disbelief " . Stephen Collins and Persis Khambatta were more favorably received . Gene Siskel felt the film " teeter [ ed ] towards being a crashing bore " whenever Khambatta was not on screen , and Jack Kroll of Newsweek felt that she had the most memorable entrance in the film . " [ Khambatta ] is sympathetic enough to make one hope she 'll have a chance to show less skin and more hair in future films " , Godfrey wrote . 
 Many critics felt that the special effects overshadowed other elements of the film . Canby stated that the film " owes more to [ Trumbull , Dykstra and Michelson ] than it does to the director , the writers or even the producer " . Livingston felt that Trumbull and Dykstra 's work on the film was not as impressive as on Star Wars and Close Encounters due to the limited amount of production time . Godfrey called the effects " stunning " , but conceded that they threatened to overpower the story two @-@ thirds of the way into the film . Kroll , Martin , and Arnold agreed that the effects were not able to carry the film or gloss over its other deficiencies ; " I 'm not sure that Trumbull & Co. have succeeded in pulling the philosophic chestnuts of Roddenberry and his co @-@ writers out of the fire , " Arnold wrote . 
 James Berardinelli , reviewing the film in 1996 , felt that the pace dragged and the plot bore too close a resemblance to the original series episode " The Changeling " , but considered the start and end of the film to be strong . Terry Lee Rioux , Kelley 's biographer , noted that the film proved " that it was the character @-@ driven play that made all the difference in Star Trek " . The slow pacing , extended reaction shots , and the film 's lack of action scenes led fans and critics to give the film a variety of nicknames , including The Motionless Picture , The Slow Motion Picture , The Motion Sickness , and Where Nomad [ the probe in " The Changeling " ] Has Gone Before .

 Paramount Home Entertainment released the film on VHS , Betamax , Laserdisc , and CED <unk> in 1981 in its original theatrical version . 
 In 1983 , an extended cut was released on VHS and premiered on the ABC television network . It added roughly 12 minutes to the film . The added footage was largely unfinished , and cobbled together for the network premiere ; Wise hadn 't wanted some of the footage to be included in the final cut of the film . This version was released by Paramount in late 1983 on VHS , Betamax , and Laserdisc . 
 Two members of Wise 's production company , David C. Fein and Michael <unk> , approached Wise and Paramount and persuaded them to release a revised version of the film on video ; Paramount released the updated Director 's Edition of the film on VHS and DVD in 2001 . Wise , who had considered the theatrical presentation of the film a " rough cut " , was given the opportunity to re @-@ edit the film to be more consistent with his original vision . The production team used the original script , surviving sequence storyboards , memos , and the director 's recollections . In addition to cuts in some sequences , 90 new and redesigned computer @-@ generated images were created . Care was taken that the effects meshed seamlessly with the old footage . The edition runs 136 minutes , about four minutes longer than the original release . Included among the special features are the deleted scenes which had been part of the television cut . 
 Aside from the effects , the soundtrack was remixed . Ambient noise such as the buzz of bridge controls were added to enhance certain scenes . Goldsmith had always suspected that some overly long cues could be shortened , so he made the cues repetitive . Although no new scenes were added , the MPAA rated the revised edition " PG " in contrast to the " G " rating of the original release . Fein attributed the rating change to the more " intense " sound mix that made scenes such as the central part of V 'Ger " more menacing " . 
 The Director 's Edition was better received by critics than the original theatrical release . The DVD Journal 's Mark Bourne said that the Director 's Edition showcased " a brisker , more attractive version of the movie " that was " as good as it might have been in 1979 . Even better maybe . " Complaints included the edition 's 2 @.@ 17 : 1 aspect ratio , as opposed to the original 2 @.@ 40 : 1 Panavision . Jeremy Conrad of IGN felt that despite the changes , the pacing might still be too slow for some viewers . 
 The film 's original theatrical cut was released on Blu @-@ ray Disc in May 2009 to coincide with the new Star Trek feature , packaged with the five following features as the Star Trek : Original Motion Picture Collection . The Motion Picture was remastered in 1080p high @-@ definition . All six films in the set have 7 @.@ 1 Dolby TrueHD audio . The disc features a new commentary track by Star Trek authors and contributors Michael and Denise Okuda , Judith and Garfield Reeves @-@ Stevens , and Daren <unk> . The original theatrical cut was also released with the four Next Generation movies as the Star Trek : <unk> Collection .

 = Oberon ( moon ) = 
 Oberon , also designated Uranus IV , is the outermost major moon of the planet Uranus . It is the second @-@ largest and second most massive of the Uranian moons , and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System . Discovered by William Herschel in 1787 , Oberon is named after the mythical king of the fairies who appears as a character in Shakespeare 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream . Its orbit lies partially outside Uranus 's magnetosphere . 
 It is likely that Oberon formed from the accretion disk that surrounded Uranus just after the planet 's formation . The moon consists of approximately equal amounts of ice and rock , and is probably differentiated into a rocky core and an icy mantle . A layer of liquid water may be present at the boundary between the mantle and the core . The surface of Oberon , which is dark and slightly red in color , appears to have been primarily shaped by asteroid and comet impacts . It is covered by numerous impact craters reaching 210 km in diameter . Oberon possesses a system of chasmata ( graben or scarps ) formed during crustal extension as a result of the expansion of its interior during its early evolution . 
 The Uranian system has been studied up close only once : the spacecraft Voyager 2 took several images of Oberon in January 1986 , allowing 40 % of the moon 's surface to be mapped . 
 = = Discovery and naming = = 
 Oberon was discovered by William Herschel on January 11 , 1787 ; on the same day he discovered Uranus 's largest moon , Titania . He later reported the discoveries of four more satellites , although they were subsequently revealed as spurious . For nearly fifty years following their discovery , Titania and Oberon would not be observed by any instrument other than William Herschel 's , although the moon can be seen from Earth with a present @-@ day high @-@ end amateur telescope . 
 All of the moons of Uranus are named after characters created by William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope . The name Oberon was derived from Oberon , the King of the Fairies in A Midsummer Night 's Dream . The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by Herschel 's son John in 1852 , at the request of William Lassell , who had discovered the other two moons , Ariel and Umbriel , the year before . The adjectival form of the name is <unk> , / <unk> / . 
 Oberon was initially referred to as " the second satellite of Uranus " , and in 1848 was given the designation Uranus II by William Lassell , although he sometimes used William Herschel 's numbering ( where Titania and Oberon are II and IV ) . In 1851 Lassell eventually numbered all four known satellites in order of their distance from the planet by Roman numerals , and since then Oberon has been designated Uranus IV . 
 = = Orbit = = 
 Oberon orbits Uranus at a distance of about 584 @,@ 000 km , being the farthest from the planet among its five major moons . Oberon 's orbit has a small orbital eccentricity and inclination relative to the equator of Uranus . Its orbital period is around 13 @.@ 5 days , coincident with its rotational period . In other words , Oberon is a synchronous satellite , tidally locked , with one face always pointing toward the planet . Oberon spends a significant part of its orbit outside the Uranian magnetosphere . As a result , its surface is directly struck by the solar wind . This is important , because the trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by the magnetospheric plasma , which co – rotates with the planet . This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres , which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon ( see below ) . 
 Because Uranus orbits the Sun almost on its side , and its moons orbit in the planet 's equatorial plane , they ( including Oberon ) are subject to an extreme seasonal cycle . Both northern and southern poles spend 42 years in a complete darkness , and another 42 years in continuous sunlight , with the sun rising close to the zenith over one of the poles at each solstice . The Voyager 2 flyby coincided with the southern hemisphere 's 1986 summer solstice , when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was in darkness . Once every 42 years , when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth , mutual occultations of Uranus 's moons become possible . One such event , which lasted for about six minutes , was observed on May 4 , 2007 , when Oberon occulted Umbriel . 
 = = Composition and internal structure = = 
 Oberon is the second largest and most massive of the Uranian moons after Titania , and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System . Oberon 's density of 1 @.@ 63 g / cm ³ , which is higher than the typical density of Saturn 's satellites , indicates that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and a dense non @-@ ice component . The latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds . The presence of water ice is supported by spectroscopic observations , which have revealed crystalline water ice on the surface of the moon . Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Oberon 's trailing hemisphere than on the leading hemisphere . This is the opposite of what is observed on other Uranian moons , where the leading hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures . The cause of this asymmetry is not known , but it may be related to impact gardening ( the creation of soil via impacts ) of the surface , which is stronger on the leading hemisphere . Meteorite impacts tend to sputter ( knock out ) ice from the surface , leaving dark non @-@ ice material behind . The dark material itself may have formed as a result of radiation processing of methane clathrates or radiation darkening of other organic compounds . 
 Oberon may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle . If this is the case , the radius of the core ( 480 km ) is about 63 % of the radius of the moon , and its mass is around 54 % of the moon 's mass — the proportions are dictated by the moon 's composition . The pressure in the center of Oberon is about 0 @.@ 5 GPa ( 5 kbar ) . The current state of the icy mantle is unclear . If the ice contains enough ammonia or other antifreeze , Oberon may possess a liquid ocean layer at the core – mantle boundary . The thickness of this ocean , if it exists , is up to 40 km and its temperature is around 180 K. However , the internal structure of Oberon depends heavily on its thermal history , which is poorly known at present . 
 = = Surface features and geology = = 
 Oberon is the second @-@ darkest large moon of Uranus after Umbriel . Its surface shows a strong opposition surge : its reflectivity decreases from 31 % at a phase angle of 0 ° ( geometrical albedo ) to 22 % at an angle of about 1 ° . Oberon has a low Bond albedo of about 14 % . Its surface is generally red in color , except for fresh impact deposits , which are neutral or slightly blue . Oberon is , in fact , the reddest among the major Uranian moons . Its trailing and leading hemispheres are asymmetrical : the latter is much redder than the former , because it contains more dark red material . The reddening of the surfaces is often a result of space weathering caused by bombardment of the surface by charged particles and micrometeorites over the age of the Solar System . However , the color asymmetry of Oberon is more likely caused by accretion of a reddish material spiraling in from outer parts of the Uranian system , possibly from irregular satellites , which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere . 
 Scientists have recognized two classes of geological feature on Oberon : craters and chasmata ( ' canyons ' — deep , elongated , steep @-@ sided depressions which would probably be described as rift valleys or escarpments if on Earth ) . Oberon 's surface is the most heavily cratered of all the Uranian moons , with a crater density approaching saturation — when the formation of new craters is balanced by destruction of old ones . This high number of craters indicates that Oberon has the most ancient surface among Uranus 's moons . The crater diameters range up to 206 kilometers for the largest known crater , Hamlet . Many large craters are surrounded by bright impact ejecta ( rays ) consisting of relatively fresh ice . The largest craters , Hamlet , Othello and Macbeth , have floors made of a very dark material deposited after their formation . A peak with a height of about 11 km was observed in some Voyager images near the south @-@ eastern limb of Oberon , which may be the central peak of a large impact basin with a diameter of about 375 km . Oberon 's surface is intersected by a system of canyons , which , however , are less widespread than those found on Titania . The canyons ' sides are probably scarps produced by normal faults which can be either old or fresh : the latter transect the bright deposits of some large craters , indicating that they formed later . The most prominent <unk> canyon is <unk> Chasma . 
 The geology of Oberon was influenced by two competing forces : impact crater formation and endogenic resurfacing . The former acted over the moon 's entire history and is primarily responsible for its present @-@ day appearance . The latter processes were active for a period following the moon 's formation . The endogenic processes were mainly tectonic in nature and led to the formation of the canyons , which are actually giant cracks in the ice crust . The canyons obliterated parts of the older surface . The cracking of the crust was caused by the expansion of Oberon by about 0 @.@ 5 % , which occurred in two phases corresponding to the old and young canyons . 
 The nature of the dark patches , which mainly occur on the leading hemisphere and inside craters , is not known . Some scientists hypothesized that they are of cryovolcanic origin ( analogs of lunar maria ) , while others think that the impacts excavated dark material buried beneath the pure ice ( crust ) . In the latter case Oberon should be at least partially differentiated , with the ice crust lying atop the non @-@ differentiated interior . 
 = = Origin and evolution = = 
 Oberon is thought to have formed from an accretion disc or subnebula : a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity . The precise composition of the subnebula is not known ; however , the relatively high density of Oberon and other Uranian moons compared to the moons of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water @-@ poor . Significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide and N2 instead of methane and ammonia . The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice ( with CO and N2 trapped as clathrate ) and more rock , explaining the higher density . 
 Oberon 's accretion probably lasted for several thousand years . The impacts that accompanied accretion caused heating of the moon 's outer layer . The maximum temperature of around 230 K was reached at the depth of about 60 km . After the end of formation , the subsurface layer cooled , while the interior of Oberon heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks . The cooling near @-@ surface layer contracted , while the interior expanded . This caused strong extensional stresses in the moon 's crust leading to cracking . The present @-@ day system of canyons may be a result of this process , which lasted for about 200 million years , implying that any endogenous activity from this cause ceased billions of years ago . 
 The initial accretional heating together with continued decay of radioactive elements were probably strong enough to melt the ice if some antifreeze like ammonia ( in the form of ammonia hydrate ) or some salt was present . Further melting may have led to the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle . A layer of liquid water ( ' ocean ' ) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core – mantle boundary . The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176 K. If the temperature dropped below this value the ocean would have frozen by now . Freezing of the water would have led to expansion of the interior , which may have also contributed to the formation of canyon @-@ like graben . Still , present knowledge of the evolution of Oberon is very limited . 
 = = Exploration = = 
 So far the only close @-@ up images of Oberon have been from the Voyager 2 probe , which photographed the moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986 . Since the closest approach of Voyager 2 to Oberon was 470 @,@ 600 km , the best images of this moon have spatial resolution of about 6 km . The images cover about 40 % of the surface , but only 25 % of the surface was imaged with a resolution that allows geological mapping . At the time of the flyby the southern hemisphere of Oberon was pointed towards the Sun , so the dark northern hemisphere could not be studied . No other spacecraft has ever visited the Uranian system , and no mission to this satellite is planned in the foreseeable future .

 " Nobody 's Business " received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics with many of them labeling the song as standout on the album . Despite that , some journalists criticized Rihanna 's decision to collaborate with Brown again because of their former relationship and domestic violence case . Following the release of Unapologetic , as a result of the strong digital downloads , the song charted on multiple charts worldwide ; it peaked at number 36 on the French Singles Chart , number seven on the UK Singles R & B Chart , number 63 on the UK Singles Chart and number 39 on the US Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs .

 On February 8 , 2009 , Rihanna 's scheduled performance at the 51st Grammy Awards was cancelled . Reports later surfaced regarding an altercation with then @-@ boyfriend , singer Chris Brown , who was arrested on suspicion of making criminal threats . On March 5 , 2009 , Brown was charged with assault and making criminal threats . Over 3 years after the incident , in January 2012 , Rihanna was intending to remix the interlude " Birthday Cake " from her 2011 studio album Talk That Talk . On February 15 , 2012 , <unk> of Da Internz , who produced the interlude , revealed that the featured collaborator will " shock the world , " and that the full length version would premiere between February 16 , and February 20 , 2012 . The full length version of " Birthday Cake " revealed to feature Brown and was released on Rihanna 's birthday , February 20 , 2012 . " Subsequently , Rihanna lent her vocals to the remix of Brown 's 2012 single " Turn Up the Music " . Following the leak of the remixes , Rihanna 's decision to collaborate with Brown after the 2009 altercation , was largely criticized by media . 
 In March 2012 , Rihanna began " working on the new sound " for her seventh studio album , even though she had not yet begun recording . On September 12 , 2012 , Def Jam France announced via Twitter that Rihanna would release a new single the upcoming week while her seventh studio album was scheduled to be released in November 2012 . On October 11 , 2012 , in one of her tweets revealed that the title of her new album is Unapologetic alongside with its cover . On November 6 , the singer posted the official track listing of the album , on which there was a song titled " Nobody 's Business " that featured Brown . Rihanna co @-@ wrote the song together with its producers Terius " The @-@ Dream " Nash and Carlos " Los " McKinney . Bart Schoudel recorded the track at the Sarm Studios in London and at the Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles .

According to Billboard 's reviewer , in lines like " you 'll always be the one I want to come home to " and " you 'll always be my baby " , " it makes the beyond @-@ complicated circumstances of their history impossible to ignore . " Stacy @-@ Ann Ellis of Vibe magazine , wrote that the song , like the couple ’ s first post @-@ makeup collaboration , " Birthday Cake ( Remix ) " , is about the history they share and " refuse to let go of — it ’ ll irk some people " . Digital Spy 's Robert Copsey noted that vocally Brown does his best to achieve a Jackson impression . Robert Leedham of Drowned in Sound stated that " Nobody 's Business " " makes you want to write a long , worthy think piece so you can come to terms with your own moral standing on it . " 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " Nobody 's Business " received generally positive reviews from music critics . Brad Stern of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that although the collaboration itself is controversial , the song is one of the standouts on the album . Copsey of Digital Spy , Ellis of Vibe and Leedham of Drowned in Sound agreed with Stern , with the latter stating , " On an album that ’ s mildly abrasive and not a lot of fun , its piano @-@ lead stomp and teasing vocal interplay are actually enjoyable . " Similarly , Pitchfork Media 's Jessica Hooper recognized it as one of the high points on Unapologetic . Caramanica of The New York Times wrote that it is the most tender , affectionate , spirited song on the record , " On an album full of <unk> relationships , it is the breath of cool , nourishing air . " Jon Reyes of HipHop DX wrote that the song is " a very well thought out move , probably in hopes that it would help soften the impending criticism that Rihanna would receive from singing the pop version of make @-@ up sex with her abusive ex @-@ boyfriend . " 
 Reviewers also noted and praised the interpolation of the Jackson 's song on the track . Fountaine of The Urban Daily agreed and named is at the album 's best track further stating that Jackson 's 1989 single " ain ’ t got nothing on this [ ' Nobody 's Business ' ] " . A reviewer of Billboard magazine praised Jackson 's influence in the song and stated that is hard to resist to its charm . Koski of The A.V. Club deemed " Nobody 's Business " as one of the strongest tracks on the album and compared it to the works from the singer 's seventh studio album Bad ( 1987 ) . The Huffington Post 's Mesfin Fekadu praised Jackson 's song sample on the track , however , dismissed its lyrical content . 
 Some of the critics were divided on Rihanna 's decision to collaborate with Brown again . Toronto Star 's Lucas <unk> stated that that " Nobody 's Business " is not a bad track , " it ’ s one of the catchiest and freshest @-@ sounding here — but the troubling subtext is as irksome as the irony of titling a song that proudly makes the pair ’ s business everybody 's . " Bernard Perusse of Montreal Gazette noted that although it is a pretty fair R & B smoker , there is something nauseating and sinister about the song and that is its message . Being more critical towards the collaboration , Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times wrote that the track represents a sad inversion of the 1965 single " I Got You Babe " by Sonny & Cher , further noting " Instead of singing about connection , true love and wanting to shout it to the world , the song features a convicted abuser and the woman he assaulted asking everyone to shut up and leave them alone .

 = Hurricane Patricia = 
 Hurricane Patricia ( Spanish pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) was the second @-@ most intense tropical cyclone on record worldwide , with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 872 mbar ( hPa ; 25 @.@ 75 inHg ) . Originating from a sprawling disturbance near the Gulf of Tehuantepec , south of Mexico , in mid @-@ October 2015 , Patricia was first classified a tropical depression on October 20 . Initial development was slow , with only modest strengthening within the first day of its classification . The system later became a tropical storm and was named Patricia , the twenty @-@ fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season . Exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on October 22 . A well @-@ defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and Patricia grew from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in just 24 hours — a near @-@ record pace . On October 23 , the hurricane achieved its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 215 mph ( 345 km / h ) . This made it the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Western Hemisphere , and the strongest globally in terms of 1 @-@ minute maximum sustained winds . 
 Late on October 23 , dramatic weakening ensued and Patricia made landfall near Cuixmala , Jalisco , with winds of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . This made it the strongest landfalling hurricane on record along the Pacific coast of Mexico . Patricia continued to weaken extremely quickly , faster than it had intensified , as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Mexico . Within 24 hours of moving ashore , Patricia degraded into a tropical depression and dissipated soon thereafter late on October 24 . 
 The precursor to Patricia produced widespread flooding rains in Central America . Hundreds of thousands of people were directly affected by the storm , mostly in Guatemala . At least six fatalities were attributed to the event : four in El Salvador , one in Guatemala , and one in Nicaragua . Torrential rains extended into southeastern Mexico , with areas of Quintana Roo and Veracruz reporting accumulations in excess of 19 @.@ 7 in ( 500 mm ) . Damage in Chetumal reached 1 @.@ 4 billion pesos ( US $ 84 @.@ 1 million ) . 
 As a tropical cyclone , Patricia 's effects in Mexico were tremendous ; however , the affected areas were predominantly rural , mitigating a potential large @-@ scale disaster . Violent winds tore roofs from structures and stripped coastal areas of their vegetation . Preliminary assessments indicate hundreds of homes to be destroyed ; seven fatalities are linked to the hurricane directly or indirectly , including one during evacuations . Total damage was estimated to be in excess of 5 @.@ 4 billion pesos ( US $ 323 @.@ 3 million ) , with agriculture and infrastructure comprising the majority of losses . Flooding partially associated with remnant moisture from Patricia inflicted US $ 52 @.@ 5 million in damage across Southern Texas . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On October 11 , 2015 , an area of disturbed weather traversed Central America and emerged over the eastern Pacific Ocean . The disturbance moved slowly over the next few days , later merging with a tropical wave on October 15 . The merger of these systems and the effects of a concurrent Tehuantepec gap wind event spurred the formation of a broad area of low pressure . This feature gradually consolidated and became a tropical depression shortly after 00 : 00 UTC on October 20 ; at this time the depression was situated roughly 205 mi ( 335 km ) south @-@ southeast of Salina Cruz , Mexico . A mid @-@ level ridge to the north steered the depression generally west and later pulled it north along an arcing path . 
 Development was initially slowed by locally cooler sea surface temperatures and dry air , and the depression became Tropical Storm Patricia only later that day . Once clear of the unfavorable region , Patricia traversed anomalously warm waters within an environment exceptionally conducive to rapid intensification . Dramatic strengthening began late on October 21 and continued through October 23 . Patricia reached hurricane strength shortly after 00 : 00 UTC on October 22 , featuring prominent outflow , well @-@ defined banding features , and a developing eye . Data from Hurricane Hunters investigating the cyclone indicated Patricia to have reached Category 4 status on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale by 18 : 00 UTC . 
 By the early hours of October 23 , a clear northward turn took place followed by acceleration northeast . A solid ring of − 130 ° F ( − 90 ° C ) cloud tops surrounded the hurricane 's 12 mi ( 19 km ) wide eye and signaled its intensification into a Category 5 hurricane . In a 24 @-@ hour span , Patricia 's maximum sustained winds increased by 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) , the fastest such intensification in any hurricane observed by the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) . The hurricane achieved its peak around 12 : 00 UTC on October 23 with estimated winds around 215 mph ( 345 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 872 mbar ( hPa ; 25 @.@ 75 inHg ) ; these values are based upon continued intensification after a Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm six hours prior . In the NHC 's report on Patricia , it is noted that the hurricane may have surpassed Typhoon Tip as the strongest tropical cyclone ever observed , but lack of direct observations at the time of its peak prevent analysis of such . 
 Later on October 23 , rapid weakening ensued as an eyewall replacement cycle took shape and wind shear increased . In the five hours up until landfall in Mexico , Patricia weakened at an unprecedented rate while still over water . However , it remained a violent hurricane and moved ashore around 23 : 00 UTC near Cuixmala , Jalisco , with winds of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) and an analyzed pressure of 932 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 49 inHg ) . This made it the most intense Pacific hurricane on record to strike Mexico . Once onshore , the high terrain of the Sierra Madre mountains accelerated Patricia 's weakening . The low- and mid @-@ level circulations of the cyclone decoupled , with the latter accelerating northeast , and Patricia dissipated on October 24 over central Mexico , less than 18 hours after moving ashore .

 Hurricane Patricia set multiple records for maximum strength , rate of intensification , and rate of weakening throughout its relatively short existence . With maximum sustained winds of 215 mph ( 345 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 872 mbar ( hPa ; 25 @.@ 75 inHg ) , Patricia is the most intense tropical cyclone ever observed in the Western Hemisphere . In terms of central pressure , it is also the second @-@ most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide , just shy of Typhoon Tip in 1979 which had a minimum pressure of 870 mbar ( hPa ; 25 @.@ 69 inHg ) . Patricia 's one @-@ minute maximum sustained winds ranked as the highest ever reliably observed or estimated in a tropical cyclone , surpassing Typhoon Haiyan of 2013 . The magnitude of Patricia 's rapid intensification is among the fastest ever observed . In a 24 @-@ hour period , 06 : 00 – 06 : 00 UTC October 22 – 23 , its maximum sustained winds increased from 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) to 205 mph ( 335 km / h ) , a record increase of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) . During the same period , Patricia 's central pressure fell by 95 mbar ( hPa ; 2 @.@ 81 inHg ) . Despite record over @-@ water weakening prior to striking Mexico , Patricia became the most intense Pacific hurricane to make landfall , with a pressure of 932 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 52 inHg ) .

 Prior to the arrival of Hurricane Patricia , the Government of Mexico issued multiple watches and warnings for coastal communities . A hurricane watch was first raised at 09 : 00 UTC on October 21 , encompassing areas of Michoacán , Colima , and Jalisco . A tropical storm watch also covered portions of Guerrero . As Patricia intensified , the government issued a hurricane warning for areas between Cabo Corrientes , Jalisco , and Punta San Telmo , Michoacán ; a tropical storm warning supplemented this for areas farther north and east . The hurricane warning was extended northward to include areas south of San Blas , Nayarit , on October 23 . Once the storm moved inland and the threat of damaging winds diminished , these warnings were gradually discontinued on October 24 . 
 Following Patricia 's upgrade to Category 5 status , the National Hurricane Center called the storm " potentially catastrophic " , a source of criticism and praise from various media . Citing the relatively limited damage and loss of life , some outlets , including the Associated Press , claimed the agency was exaggerating the danger posed by the storm . However , most outlets praised them for effectively communicating the dire threat and potentially saving lives from an exceptionally powerful hurricane . 
 Across Michoacán , Colima , Jalisco , and Nayarit , 1 @,@ 782 shelters were opened on October 22 with a collective capacity of 258 @,@ 000 people . Officials in Manzanillo began distributing sandbags during the afternoon of October 22 . Schools across Guerrero and Jalisco suspended activities for October 22 and 23 , respectively . Civil protection officials planned to evacuate roughly 50 @,@ 000 people from Colima , Jalisco , and Nayarit . To expedite the process , 2 aircraft and 600 buses were used to shuttle evacuees . Ultimately , 8 @,@ 500 people evacuated prior to the storm 's arrival , including 2 @,@ 600 in Cabo Corrientes . One person died during an evacuation in Jalisco . Roughly 25 @,@ 000 personnel from the Mexican Army , Navy , and Federal Police were deployed preemptively . More than 500 Red Cross volunteers were on standby . The Mexican Red Cross prepositioned food for 3 @,@ 500 families . Approximately 30 kg ( 66 lb ) of aid was prepositioned in Colima for distribution after the hurricane 's passage . The Electric Federal Commission dispatched 2 @,@ 500 crewmen , 152 cranes , 15 all @-@ terrain vehicles , 4 helicopters , and 84 generators to cope with potential power outages . Mexican authorities received praise for effectively carrying out emergency preparations .

 The precursor of Patricia was a large and sprawling system that affected much of Central America with heavy rain for several days . Rainfall was enhanced by the presence of multiple systems , including a tropical wave and a second disturbance over the Caribbean Sea . One person was killed in the Alta Verapaz Department and approximately 2 @,@ 100 people required evacuation across Guatemala . A total of 442 homes and 28 @,@ 200 ha ( 70 @,@ 000 acres ) of crops were damaged while roughly 223 @,@ 000 people were affected by flooding . Government officials deployed emergency teams and 40 million quetzal ( US $ 5 @.@ 4 million ) was available for relief operations . In nearby El Salvador between 6 @.@ 3 and 7 @.@ 3 in ( 160 and 185 mm ) of rain fell , causing similar floods . Dozens of homes were affected and four people were killed . The <unk> River overflowed its banks twice in two days , inundating surrounding communities . Owing to widespread flooding , authorities suspended school activities across the country on October 19 . In Nicaragua , a landslide buried four miners in Bonanza ; one died while the others were rescued . The Ulúa River in Honduras over @-@ topped its banks for the first time in 17 years on October 18 , prompting the evacuation of more than 200 people . Furthermore , flooding damaged 10 homes in <unk> , Costa Rica . 
 The aforementioned rains extended into Southwestern and Northeastern Mexico , falling from October 18 – 20 ; precipitation was enhanced by another tropical disturbance over the northwestern Caribbean Sea . Portions of Quintana Roo saw their most intense rainfall event on record , with 19 @.@ 8 in ( 502 mm ) observed in Chetumal . This surpassed the previous record of 18 in ( 450 mm ) during Hurricane Wilma in 2005 . Flooding affected approximately 1 @,@ 500 homes in the city , with 150 people seeking refuge in public shelters . Damage in Chetumal was pegged at 1 @.@ 4 billion pesos ( US $ 84 @.@ 1 million ) . Seven municipalities were declared disaster areas accordingly . In nearby Veracruz , more than 24 in ( 600 mm ) of rain caused widespread flooding ; at least 50 municipalities reported damage from the event as multiple rivers over @-@ topped their banks . Flooding in Tabasco affected 7 @,@ 500 ha ( 19 @,@ 000 acres ) of crops . In Oaxaca , several roads were washed out by the accompanying floods and mudslides , particularly in the Sierra Norte region .

 Hurricane Patricia made landfall in Jalisco as a Category 4 hurricane during the evening of October 23 . The 15 mi ( 24 km ) wide core of Patricia largely avoided populated centers , passing through areas with a population density less than 30 people per square mile . This , alongside effective evacuations , is credited for the relatively low death toll , despite the hurricane 's intensity . Several small communities along the path sustained tremendous damage , however . Had the hurricane moved farther east or west , the densely populated areas surrounding Manzanillo or Puerto Vallarta would have suffered a direct hit . 
 Throughout the affected region , the storm 's powerful winds left 261 @,@ 989 people without electricity . Twenty @-@ one of the nation 's thirty @-@ one states , and the Federal District , were affected by the hurricane 's rain . Accumulations in Jalisco peaked at 15 @.@ 09 in ( 383 @.@ 2 mm ) on Nevado de Colima .

 Striking Jalisco as a strong Category 4 hurricane , Patricia wrought tremendous damage , though the most extreme effects were relatively localized . In the small community of Emiliano Zapata , the hurricane 's violent winds tore roofs off homes and business . Countless trees were defoliated , stripped of their branches , snapped , or uprooted . <unk> along the immediate landfall area were largely stripped of vegetation . Storm chaser Josh <unk> described the aftermath : " ... the tropical landscape was transformed into something barren and wintry . " Furthermore , the winds toppled concrete power poles and crumpled transmission towers . 
 Throughout Jalisco , approximately 9 @,@ 000 homes were damaged or destroyed . The coastal hamlet of Chamela , home to 40 families , was completely flattened . More than 24 @,@ 000 ha ( 59 @,@ 000 acres ) of crops were affected across the state : 10 @,@ 684 ha ( 26 @,@ 400 acres ) sustained total losses while 13 @,@ 943 ha ( 34 @,@ 450 acres ) were partially so . Damage from agriculture amounted to roughly 168 million pesos ( US $ 10 @.@ 1 million ) . Total damage reached to 1 @.@ 139 billion pesos ( US $ 68 @.@ 7 million ) . 
 A total of six deaths in incidents related to Patricia were reported in the state . Two of these deaths occurred when a tree toppled over in the storm 's powerful winds . A woman was also hospitalized after sustaining injuries in the same incident . Another four people were killed in an automobile accident in southern Jalisco . Two of the victims died in the wreckage and the other two died after being brought to a hospital .

 = First Partition of Poland = 
 The First Partition of Poland or First Partition of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth took place in 1772 as the first of three partitions that ended the existence of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth by 1795 . Growth in the Russian Empire 's power , threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire , was the primary motive behind this first partition . Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria , jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire , from going to war . The weakened Commonwealth 's land , including that was already controlled by Russia , was apportioned among its more powerful neighbors — Austria , Russia and Prussia — so as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries . With Poland unable to effectively defend itself , and with foreign troops already inside the country , the Polish parliament ( Sejm ) ratified the partition in 1773 during the Partition Sejm convened by the three powers . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the late 17th and early 18th centuries , the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth had been reduced from the status of a major European power to that of a Russian protectorate ( or vassal or satellite state ) , with the Russian tsar effectively choosing Polish @-@ Lithuanian monarchs during the free elections and deciding the outcome of much of Poland 's internal politics , for example during the Repnin Sejm , named after the Russian ambassador who unofficially presided over the proceedings . 
 The First Partition occurred after the balance of power in Europe shifted , with Russian victories against the Ottomans in the Russo @-@ Turkish War ( 1768 – 1774 ) strengthening Russia and endangering Habsburg interests in that region ( particularly in Moldavia and Wallachia ) . At that point Habsburg Austria started considering waging war against Russia . 
 France , friendly towards both Russia and Austria , suggested a series of territorial adjustments , in which Austria would be compensated by parts of Prussian Silesia , and Prussia in turn would regain Prussian Ermland ( Warmia ) and parts of a Polish fief , the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia — already under Baltic German hegemony . King Frederick II of Prussia had no intention of giving up Silesia gained recently in the Silesian Wars ; he was , however , also interested in finding a peaceful solution — his alliance with Russia would draw him into a potential war with Austria , and the Seven Years ' War had left Prussia 's treasury and army weakened . He was also interested in protecting the weakening Ottoman Empire , which could be advantageously utilized in the event of a Prussian war either with Russia or Austria . Frederick 's brother , Prince Henry , spent the winter of 1770 – 71 as a representative of the Prussian court at Saint Petersburg . As Austria had annexed 13 towns in the Hungarian Szepes region in 1769 ( violating the Treaty of Lubowla ) , Catherine II of Russia and her advisor General Ivan Chernyshyov suggested to Henry that Prussia claim some Polish land , such as Ermland . After Henry informed him of the proposal , Frederick suggested a partition of the Polish borderlands by Austria , Prussia , and Russia , with the largest share going to the party most weakened by the recent changes in balance of power , Austria . Thus Frederick attempted to encourage Russia to direct its expansion towards weak and non @-@ functional Poland instead of the Ottomans . Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz counter @-@ proposed that Prussia take lands from Poland in return for relinquishing Silesia to Austria , but this plan was rejected by Frederick . 
 Although for a few decades ( since the times of the Silent Sejm ) Russia had seen weak Poland as its own protectorate , Poland had also been devastated by a civil war in which the forces of the Bar Confederation , formed in Bar , attempted to disrupt Russian control over Poland . The recent <unk> peasant and Cossack uprising in Ukraine also weakened the Polish position . Further , the Russian @-@ supported Polish king , Stanisław August Poniatowski , was seen as both weak and too independent @-@ minded ; eventually the Russian court decided that the usefulness of Poland as a protectorate had diminished . The three powers officially justified their actions as a compensation for dealing with troublesome neighbor and restoring order to Polish anarchy ( the Bar Confederation provided a convenient excuse ) ; in fact all three were interested in territorial gains . 
 After Russia occupied the Danubian Principalities , Henry convinced Frederick and Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria that the balance of power would be maintained by a tripartite division of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth instead of Russia taking land from the Ottomans . Under pressure from Prussia , which for a long time wanted to annex the northern Polish province of Royal Prussia , the three powers agreed on the First Partition of Poland . This was in light of the possible Austrian @-@ Ottoman alliance with only token objections from Austria , which would have instead preferred to receive more Ottoman territories in the Balkans , a region which for a long time had been coveted by the Habsburgs . The Russians also withdrew from Moldavia away from the Austrian border . An attempt of Bar Confederates to kidnap king Poniatowski on 3 November 1771 gave the three courts another pretext to showcase the " Polish anarchy " and the need for its neighbors to step in and " save " the country and its citizens . 
 = = Partition begins = = 
 Already by 1769 — 71 , both Austria and Prussia had taken over some border territories of the Commonwealth , with Austria taking Szepes County in 1769 – 1770 and Prussia incorporating Lauenburg and Bütow . On February 19 , 1772 , the agreement of partition was signed in Vienna . A previous agreement between Prussia and Russia had been made in Saint Petersburg on February 6 , 1772 . Early in August , Russian , Prussian and Austrian troops simultaneously entered the Commonwealth and occupied the provinces agreed upon among themselves . On August 5 , the three parties signed the treaty on their respective territorial gains on the commonwealth 's expense . 
 The regiments of the Bar Confederation , whose executive board had been forced to leave Austria ( which previously supported them ) after that country joined the <unk> @-@ Russian alliance , did not lay down their arms . Many fortresses in their command held out as long as possible ; Wawel Castle in Kraków fell only at the end of April ; Tyniec fortress held until the end of July 1772 ; Częstochowa , commanded by Kazimierz Pułaski , held until late August . In the end , the Bar Confederation was defeated , with its members either fleeing abroad or being deported to Siberia by the Russians . 
 = = Division of territories = = 
 The partition treaty was ratified by its signatories on September 22 , 1772 . It was a major success for Frederick II of Prussia : Prussia 's share might have been the smallest , but it was also significantly developed and strategically important . Prussia took most of Polish Royal Prussia , including Ermland , allowing Frederick to link East Prussia and Brandenburg . Prussia also annexed northern areas of Greater Poland along the Noteć River ( the <unk> District ) , and northern Kuyavia , but not the cities of Danzig ( Gdańsk ) and Thorn ( Toruń ) . The territories annexed by Prussia became a new province in 1773 called West Prussia . Overall , Prussia gained 36 @,@ 000 km2 and about 600 @,@ 000 people . According to Jerzy <unk> Frederick the Great soon introduced German colonists on territories he conquered and engaged in Germanization of Polish territories . Frederick II settled 26 @,@ 000 Germans in Polish Pomerania which influenced the ethnic situation in the region that at the time had around 300 @,@ 000 inhabitants , and enforced Germanization . According to Christopher Clark in certain areas annexed by Prussia like <unk> and Royal Prussia 54 percent of the population 75 percent of the urban populace were German @-@ speaking Protestants . In the next century this was used by nationalistic German historians to justify the partition , but it was irrelevant to contemporary calculations ; Frederick , dismissive of German culture , was instead pursuing an imperialist policy , acting on the security interests of his state . The new @-@ gained territories connected Prussia with Germany proper , and were of major economic importance . By seizing northwestern Poland , Prussia instantly cut off Poland from the sea , and gained control over 80 % of the Commonwealth 's total foreign trade . Through levying enormous custom duties , Prussia accelerated the inevitable collapse of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian state . 
 Despite token criticism of the partition from the Austrian archduchess , Empress Maria Theresa , Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz considered the Austrian share an ample compensation ; despite Austria being the least interested in the partition , it received the largest share of formerly Polish population , and second largest land share ( 83 @,@ 000 km2 and 2 @,@ 650 @,@ 000 people ) . To Austria fell Zator and Auschwitz ( Oświęcim ) , part of Little Poland embracing parts of the counties of Kraków and Sandomierz ( with the rich salt mines of Bochnia and Wieliczka ) , and the whole of Galicia , less the city of Kraków . 
 Russia received the largest , but least @-@ important area economically , in the northeast . By this " diplomatic document " Russia came into possession of the commonwealth territories east of the line formed roughly by the Dvina , <unk> , and Dnieper Rivers — that section of Livonia which had still remained in commonwealth control , and of Belarus embracing the counties of Vitebsk , Polotsk and <unk> . Russia gained 92 @,@ 000 square kilometers ( 36 @,@ 000 sq mi ) and 1 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 people , and reorganized its newly acquired lands into Pskov Governorate ( which also included two provinces of Novgorod Governorate ) and Mogilev Governorate . <unk> Chernyshyov was appointed the Governor General of the new territories on May 28 , 1772 . 
 By the first partition the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth lost about 211 @,@ 000 square kilometers ( 81 @,@ 000 sq mi ) ( 30 % of its territory , amounting at that time to about 733 @,@ 000 square kilometers ( 283 @,@ 000 sq mi ) ) , with a population of over four to five million people ( about a third of its population of fourteen million before the partitions ) .

 After having occupied their respective territories , the three partitioning powers demanded that King Stanisław August Poniatowski and the Sejm approve their action . The king appealed to the nations of Western Europe for help and tarried with the convocation of the Sejm . The European powers reacted to the partition with utmost indifference ; only a few voices — like that of Edmund Burke — were raised in objection . 
 When no help was forthcoming and the armies of the combined nations occupied Warsaw to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly , no alternative could be chosen save passive submission to their will . Those of the senators who advised against this step were threatened by the Russians , represented by the ambassador , Otto von Stackelberg , who declared that in the face of refusal the whole capital of Warsaw would be destroyed by them . Other threats included execution , confiscation of estates , and further increases of partitioned territory ; according to Edward Henry Lewinski Corwin , some senators were even arrested by the Russians and exiled to Siberia . 
 The local land assemblies ( Sejmiks ) refused to elect deputies to the Sejm , and after great difficulties less than half of the regular number of representatives came to attend the session led by Marshals of the Sejm , Michał Hieronim Radziwiłł and Adam Poniński ; the latter in particular was one of many Polish nobles bribed by the Russians and following their orders . This sejm became known as the Partition Sejm . In order to prevent the disruption of the Sejm via liberum veto and the defeat of the purpose of the invaders , Poniński undertook to turn the regular Sejm into a confederated sejm , where majority rule prevailed . In spite of the efforts of individuals like Tadeusz Rejtan , Samuel Korsak , and Stanisław Bohuszewicz to prevent it , the deed was accomplished with the aid of Poniński , Radziwiłł , and the bishops Andrzej <unk> , Ignacy Jakub Massalski , and Antoni Kazimierz Ostrowski ( primate of Poland ) , who occupied high positions in the Senate of Poland . The Sejm elected a committee of thirty to deal with the various matters presented . On September 18 , 1773 , the committee formally signed the treaty of cession , renouncing all claims of the Commonwealth to the lost territories .

It was the first Colombian film during the silent film era with a film score , which was performed during the projection and was written by Alberto Urdaneta <unk> . 
 At its first screening , the film was well received by critics and the public , and was later shown in Panama and Venezuela . Given the theme of leprosy , the film was criticized by some who believed it would have a negative impact on the image of Colombia . Despite parts of the film not surviving , the Fundación Patrimonio Fílmico Colombiano have retained a 22 minute 45 second excerpt from the film .

 Arturo Acevedo Vallarino was the producer and director of a theatre company in Antioquia and one of the pioneers of Colombian cinema . After the introduction of foreign films into Colombia , theatres were not as profitable , leading Acevedo to create a production house in 1920 , Acevedo e Hijos ( Acevedo and Son ) , originally known as Casa <unk> Colombia . Acevedo wrote and directed the film . 
 According to Colombian film critic Luis Alberto Alvarez , to promote their film productions before releasing them , Acevedo e Hijos launched magazine Cine Colombiano , the first issue of which was published on 1 May 1924 . In this first issue , the main article reveals the prologue and first four chapters of the film , with <unk> H. González credited as the author of the article . The musical score of the film , written by Alberto Urdaneta <unk> , is also in this issue . 
 = = = Implementation = = = 
 La tragedia del silencio was shot in temporary studios in the house of a priest named Moreira , which is now the location of the Jorge @-@ Eliécer @-@ Gaitán theatre . Initially , the film was shot with a Pathé camera with a 45mm lens , but later a 35mm Kodak Ektachrome was used . The chemicals used for the production of the film were purchased from <unk> <unk> , a company located in Bogotá founded in 1914 by Ernesto Schmidt Mumm . The photographic print was manufactured by the scientific section of airline <unk> . 
 With La tragedia del silencio , production company Acevedo e Hijos ensured that this was the first full @-@ length entirely Colombian film , with all actors and production team members being born in Colombia . It was the only Colombian film during the silent film era ( 1894 to 1929 ) to have a score . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The promotion strategy for the film played on nationalist sentiment by announcing that La tragedia del silencio was the first authentically Colombian movie . It was first screened to the public on 18 July 1924 in Faenza theatre in Bogotá , attracting a large audience . There were several technical problems including power failure and projector errors , caused in particular by the nervousness of the director and his son , the director of the theatre Joaquín Francisco , and operator Gustavo Francisco . However , the film was well received by the public and the press , although some viewers complained about the poor image quality . The theatre was crowded during the seventeen showings of the film , but it was not very successful financially . 
 The first screening of La tragedia del silencio in Medellín was on 9 October 1924 , and was praised by the local press as an important development for the Colombian film industry . Following this screening , Colombian industrialist Gonzalo Mejía provided financial support to Acevedo e Hijos , resulting in the release of their next film Bajo el Cielo <unk> in 1925 . The film was also successful in Panama and Venezuela . 
 As the film addresses the topic of leprosy , some viewers voiced concerns that Colombia was frowned upon by the world because of the film , and that it resulted in the decrease of the price of Colombian coffee abroad . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 = = = Topics covered = = = 
 La tragedia del silencio does not address political , social , or economic topics , nor different cultural aspects such as the lifestyle of the Colombian population . Acevedo did not intend for the film to create controversy , so it does not mention the situation in Colombia , the plot of the film instead focusing narrowly on one man 's struggle between life and death . Although leprosy is the main theme of the film , there are other storylines that follow different protagonists and their motivations , such as the husband learning he must face his destiny when he learns about his disease , which requires him to separate from his family . After learning he does not have leprosy , he most confront a rival ( the student ) to regain the love of his wife . 
 The first issue of Cine Colombiano contained several images from La tragedia del silencio that could be allegories of Jesus , the <unk> people 's myth of <unk> , or the Colombian civil wars . The film has a religious aspect in the character of Father Alberto , who refers directly to Colombian Father Rafael Almansa . 
 = = = Film style = = = 
 In an attempt to imitate the conventions of silent cinema in its infancy , the staging and acting of the film are exaggerated and artificial . The equipment used by Acevedo had limitations , causing the indoor scenes to be underexposed and the outdoor scenes to be overexposed . The Pathé camera did not allow camera movement , had imprecise definition , and dark rendering . The Kodak Ektachrome lacked a large depth of field , producing a flat image , and required good lighting to operate effectively . Overhead shots are most commonly used , with some medium shots and a small number of large shots .

 In 1987 , the documentary Más <unk> del silencio La tragedia gave an overview of the work done by the Acevedo family . The documentary takes its name from La tragedia del silencio , however it also aimed to commemorate the first sound film of Colombia , Los <unk> <unk> de cine <unk> nacional , directed by Acevedo in 1937 . 
 The Fundación Patrimonio Fílmico Colombiano is conserving and restoring the first nitrocellulose recordings of Colombian films , as well as some earlier Columbian films . It has been able to preserve 22 minutes and 45 seconds of La tragedia del silencio , at 18 frames per second . In 2009 , the Fundación Patrimonio Fílmico Colombiano announced that it was releasing ten DVDs , including work by the Acevedo family . On 24 August 2009 , the restored version of the film inaugurated the seventh festival of Colombian cinema in Medellín ( Spanish : Festival de Cine Colombiano Ciudad de Medellín ) . 
 = Maverick Hunter = 
 Maverick Hunter is the codename for a cancelled first @-@ person shooter video game that would have been developed by Armature Studio and published by Capcom . It was intended to be a darker entry in the Mega Man X series . Mega Man creator Keiji Inafune was responsible for establishing the western @-@ designed game and Adi Granov was responsible for X 's new design . It was intended to be the first of a trilogy of games , where players controlled its protagonist X in the first two games and then as Zero for the third . The game would have had similar platform elements found in earlier Mega Man X titles . It had a lifespan of about six months in 2010 before it was ultimately cancelled due to the aforementioned internal disagreements around the same time as Inafune departed from Capcom and other Mega Man titles were cancelled . 
 Its design , which critics described as " gritty " and " dark " , produced polarized opinions from fans , critics , and Capcom staff alike . Clint Mize criticized the art style , potential gameplay problems , and the risk associated with competing with first @-@ person shooter games such as Call of Duty , Halo , and Battlefield . Despite the mixed opinion among fans , a fan @-@ led Facebook group and Change.org petition were created called " Operation Maverick Hunter " , which was intended to convince Capcom to revive the project . Granov expressed disappointment with its cancellation . 
 = = Concept and development = = 
 Maverick Hunter was in development by Armature Studio and was to be published by Capcom for the Mega Man X series . The collaboration was established by Mega Man creator Keiji Inafune and the goal was to attract a new audience to the Mega Man series . Its development would have been overseen by former Capcom producer Ben Judd . The redesign for the Mega Man character was to be done by Adi Granov ( the concept artist responsible for the Iron Man redesign found in the 2008 film of the same name ) . An initial concept design showed X with a red glowing ' X ' on his face . 
 Unlike other Mega Man X titles , Maverick Hunter was a first @-@ person shooter . The genre was chosen in response to the rising interest in first @-@ person shooter games in the west . The gameplay would have adhered to core Mega Man X concepts ; the ability to take and utilize the powers of enemies , his dash , and his X @-@ Buster were all to be redesigned . His weapon designs were made to be more realistic than earlier Mega Man X titles . Instead of his arm transforming into a cannon , his armor transforms to create a gun . Additionally , his charged attack would launch a missile instead of launching a larger energy blast . Melee attacks would cause the game to switch to a third @-@ person perspective for the attack . X 's ability to steal abilities from others would have been expanded to allow the combination of abilities and the use of temporary weapons , such as bombs or tank turrets , from fallen enemies . The stolen abilities could also be used to exploit weaknesses in certain enemies . Platform elements such as his wall jump from the Mega Man X games would have been " re @-@ imagined in new ways . " The game was also planned to have branching paths and upgrades to find throughout . 
 Maverick Hunter was going to build upon the mythology and feature characters from the original Mega Man X titles . Capcom Japan was responsible for the design of key story points and twists while the overall plot would be handled by Armature Studio . A source familiar with the game stated that the game would " be like taking an 8 @-@ bit game that doesn 't have a very deep story to it , and then building around it and keeping some of the key pieces intact . " Both Mega Man X and Zero would be featured alongside a new human sidekick who is a " Bruce Willis @-@ like police officer . " The inclusion of the human sidekick was part of the game 's " man versus machine contrast . " It was to be the first of a trilogy of games ; players would control X in the first two games while they would switch to Zero in the third game , who must destroy X ( who had become " incredibly powerful and infinitely intelligent over the course of two games " ) . 
 = = = Cancellation = = = 
 It was ultimately cancelled before it was revealed to the public as one of several recent cancellations in the Mega Man series ( including Mega Man Legends 3 , Mega Man Universe , and Mega Man Online ) . Its lifespan lasted for about six months in 2010 , and was prototyped and playable . Despite positive internal reception , Capcom deemed it a " significant gamble " and cancelled it . Its cancellation coincided with Inafune 's departure from Capcom . The playable version of the game was intended to be a proof of concept more so than a real game . Capcom senior vice president Christian Svensson noted that the game was the subject of " very polarized opinions internally . " Granov expressed disappointment over the cancellation and stated that he was " very happy " with his design work .

 The response from critics and fans alike has been mixed . Despite the mixed fan reaction , a fan @-@ led Facebook group and Change.org petition intended to revive the project was created called " Operation Maverick Hunter " . Michael McWhertor and Wes Fenlon felt that - with the information available - the game seemed like a " formula for success . " They compared the direction to that of Metroid Prime by developer Retro Studios ( from which Armature Studio spun off from ) . Thomas Whitehead was also positive about it ; he stated that it could have been a " bold , exciting new direction for the franchise . " 
 Joystiq 's JC Fletcher noted that while Mega Man X didn 't need a " gritty " reboot , it is a better alternative than to have no Mega Man games . Tony Ponce compared the redesign of X to that of Bomberman in Bomberman : Act Zero . He also stated that it was a Mega Man X game " in the very loosest sense . " He felt that the cancellation was for the best and that a " cold , gritty first @-@ person shooter " was not the ideal direction for the series . He compared it to Metroid Prime 's design by noting that the art style did not change much while X 's redesign was " virtually unrecognizable . " He later commented that an early concept design by Adi Granov was " not that bad " if it had no relation to the Mega Man X series . Chris Carter felt that while he didn 't think the series needed a " gritty reboot " , he would have enjoyed it if it was good . Clint Mize wrote an article for MTV.com 's gaming section detailing why Maverick Hunter was a terrible idea . He felt that it could have turned off " core fans " of the Mega Man X series and that X required a " solid core title to reintroduce the character " rather than a " dark reimagining " . He added that the decision to make it a first @-@ person shooter made it feel like it was the product of an " out of touch executive " . He also criticized it due to the risk involved in competing with big FPS games such as Call of Duty , Halo , and Battlefield . He noted that the perspective introduces other problems , such as reduced emphasis on platform segments . Its art design and gameplay have been compared to the video game Vanquish .

Dónde Están los Ladrones ? spawned the Arabian @-@ styled single " Ojos Así " ( " Eyes Like Yours " ) , which became a hit and was deemed the " signature track " of the album . 
 American singer Gloria Estefan , whose husband Emilio Estefan was managing Shakira at that time , felt that Shakira had the potential to crossover into the mainstream pop industry . However , Shakira was initially hesitant to record songs in English as it was not her first language , so Estefan offered to translate " Ojos Así " into English in order to show her that " it could translate well . " Shakira then began translating the song herself and showed it to Estefan , who responded " Quite honestly , I can 't do this better ! . " As Shakira wanted to have full control over her recordings , she decided to learn English better to enable her to write her own songs . Wanting to " find a way to express my ideas and my feelings , my day @-@ to @-@ day stories in English " , Shakira bought rhyming dictionaries , started analysing the lyrics of songs by Bob Dylan , reading poetry and the work of authors like Leonard Cohen and Walt Whitman and took English lessons from a private tutor . " Objection ( Tango ) " became the first song Shakira wrote in English and in an interview with <unk> , she talked about the writing process of the song , saying " I prayed and asked God to send me a good song today , and I remember I started writing the song [ ' Objection ( Tango ) ' ] a couple of hours after . I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time , and when that happens it 's really magical to me . " Shakira also wrote and recorded a Spanish @-@ version of the song entitled " Te Aviso , Te Anuncio ( Tango ) " . 
 " Objection ( Tango ) " was released as the third single from Laundry Service in a promotional CD single format on 6 July 2002 . It was later released on 27 August as a CD single featuring the previous single from the album " Underneath Your Clothes " as the B side . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Objection ( Tango ) " was written by Shakira and co @-@ produced by the singer along with Lester Mendez . It is a combination of pop rock and tango , a style of fast @-@ paced ballroom dance music that originated in Argentina and Uruguay . According to the sheet music of " Objection ( Tango ) " published at MusicNotes.com by Sony / ATV Music Publishing , it is written in the key of B minor and has a half note metronome of 66 beats per minute . Shakira 's vocal range spans from E3 to B4 . The song contains instrumentation from the bandoneón , which is played at a " breakneck speed , " and also features a " twanging " guitar solo . Lyrically , " Objection ( Tango ) " is dramatic and humorous in approach and focuses on an angered Shakira ordering her love interest to choose between her and his other leading lady ; it was said to be a feminist anthem and a " hell @-@ hath @-@ no @-@ fury it 's @-@ her @-@ or @-@ me steam train " . It contains a line in which Shakira asserts to her lover that " Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal / That ’ s why in front of your eyes I look minimal / But you gotta know small things also count , " which a critic commented was a " brave statement in these days of suspiciously ripe teenybop flesh peddlers . " During the bridge of the song , Shakira delivers rap @-@ like vocals and instructs her lover to end the love triangle , declaring that " Tango is not for three , was never meant to be . "

 Alex Henderson from AllMusic selected the song as one of the highlights from Laundry Service and commented that " [ Shakira ] successfully combines pop / rock with [ ... ] tango on ' Objection ( Tango ) ' . " Chuck Taylor from Billboard gave it a very positive review , praising Shakira 's vocal delivery , the spoken bridge , and its radio @-@ friendly sound , saying that it is " perfectly timed for the singalong days of summer and adds fuel to the bonfire that this amiable talent [ Shakira ] has ignited . " The critic compared " Objection ( Tango ) " to Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin 's song " Livin ' la Vida Loca " , and the work of American new wave band The B @-@ 52 's . Alexis Petridis from The Guardian picked " Objection ( Tango ) " as an example of Shakira 's unusual style of production and opined that it " sounds like the B @-@ 52 's jamming with a wedding reception combo [ sic ] . " Matt Cibula from PopMatters complimented Shakira 's songwriting and termed the song a " fine <unk> with drama and a sense of humor . " The critic too enjoyed the bridge of the song , saying " the little growly semi @-@ rap break at the end is fun as hell . " Lisa Oliver from Yahoo ! Music , however , felt the song was on the " <unk> side " of the album . 
 At the 18th Annual International Dance Music Awards ceremony in 2003 , " Objection ( Tango ) " was nominated for " Best Latin Dance Track " , but lost to Mexican singer Thalía 's song " Dance Dance ( The Mexican ) " . Shakira and Mendez won a BMI Latin Award in 2003 for their composition of " Te Aviso , Te Anuncio ( Tango ) " , the Spanish @-@ language version of the song . " Te Aviso , Te Anuncio ( Tango ) " was also nominated for " Best Rock Song " at the 2003 Latin Grammy Awards , but lost to Colombian musician Juanes 's song Mala Gente " .

 The accompanying music video for " Objection ( Tango ) " was directed by Dave Meyers and choreographed by Tina Landon . It begins with Shakira and her love interest doing tango in a bar @-@ like setting , starting with a low paced routine . The tango becomes faster and more intricate as the opening beat of the song kicks in . Shakira 's love interest exits the bar abruptly , leaving her alone to dance to the song . She follows the man in a yellow car and arrives at a club where she sees him with another woman , played by Hawaiian actress Tabitha Taylor . An animated cartoon @-@ styled sequence follows as Shakira jumps over the crowd and fights her unfaithful lover and Taylor . While wrestling the latter , Shakira pinches both of her nipples and her breasts are shown to reduce in size as the line " Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal " plays . After Shakira defeats the man , the animated sequence ends and the fight is shown to happen only in Shakira 's imagination . When she tries to fight the man and Taylor in reality , she is quickly defeated and crashes into a glass table . Two men resembling comical superheroes , one of whom is played by Dan Southworth , appear to her aid and quickly defeat the man , while Shakira defeats Taylor . The two are shown gagged up in the boot of Shakira 's car and are then tied up on spinning discs . The discs rotate faster and faster until they come off and are sent flying off at a high speed . Scenes of Shakira dancing at the bar and performing the song with a band are interspersed throughout the video . The music video reached number one on the Total Request Live chart .

 On 29 August 2002 , Shakira performed " Objection ( Tango ) " at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City . Instead of tango , the performance of the song was inspired by samba and featured a large number of percussionists on the stage . Shakira incorporated belly dancing moves in her choreography and near to the end of the performance , she fell backward into the crowd and " was delivered back to the stage quickly enough not to miss a single line . " Jon Wiederhorn from MTV praised Shakira 's stage presence and called her belly dancing routine " seductive . " " Objection ( Tango ) " was included in the setlist of Tour of the Mongoose , Shakira 's first worldwide tour that was launched in support of Laundry Service . Similar to the MTV Video Music Awards , a samba @-@ oriented version of the song was performed and it was the final performance before the encore segment . The performance boasted instrumentation from numerous bongo drums . Corey Moss from MTV opined that it " featured Shakira 's best belly dancing yet " and " had the audience screaming for an encore . " Steve Baltin from Rolling Stone selected the performance of the song as one of the highlights of the show , saying " surrounding herself with bongo drums during " Objection ( Tango ) " [ ... ] she embodied all the glitz and glamour of good old @-@ fashioned rock & roll . " At the 2011 Latin Grammy Awards ceremony , Spanish music duo <unk> performed a live cover of the song in rumba as part of the Latin Grammys tribute to Shakira , where she was honored Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year . 
 As part of her global sponsorship and advertising agreement with American multinational food and beverage corporation PepsiCo to promote their carbonated soft drink Pepsi , Shakira starred in a television commercial for the brand 's " Dare For More " campaign . The commercial was released in 2004 and shows Shakira dancing to " Objection ( Tango ) " with a clerk in a convenience store .

 = Megalosaurus = 
 Megalosaurus ( meaning " Great Lizard " , from Greek μέγας , megas , meaning ' big ' , ' tall ' or ' great ' and σαῦρος , sauros , meaning ' lizard ' ) is a genus of large meat @-@ eating theropod dinosaurs of the Middle Jurassic period ( Bathonian stage , 166 million years ago ) of Southern England . Although fossils from other areas have been assigned to the genus , the only certain remains of Megalosaurus come from the late Middle Jurassic of the Oxfordshire . 
 The earliest possible fossils of the genus came from the Taynton Limestone Formation . One of these was the lower part of a femur , discovered in the 17th century . It was originally described by Robert Plot as a thighbone of a Roman war elephant , and then as a biblical giant . The first scientific name given for it , in the 18th century , was Scrotum humanum , created by Richard Brookes as a caption ; however , this is not considered valid today . 
 Megalosaurus was , in 1824 , the first genus of non @-@ avian dinosaur to be validly named . The type species is Megalosaurus bucklandii , named in 1827 . In 1842 , Megalosaurus was one of three genera on which Richard Owen based his Dinosauria . On Owen 's directions a model was made as one of the Crystal Palace Dinosaurs , which greatly increased the public interest for prehistoric reptiles . Subsequently , over fifty other species would be classified under the genus , originally because dinosaurs were not well known , but even during the 20th century after many dinosaurs had been discovered . Today it is understood these additional species were not directly related to M. bucklandii , which is the only true Megalosaurus species . Because a complete skeleton of it has never been found , much is still unclear about its build . 
 The first naturalists who investigated Megalosaurus mistook it for a gigantic lizard of twenty metres length . In 1842 , Owen concluded that it was no longer than nine metres , standing on upright legs . He still thought it was a quadruped , though . Modern scientists , by comparing Megalosaurus with its direct relatives in the Megalosauridae , were able to obtain a more accurate picture . Megalosaurus was about seven metres long , weighing about 1 @.@ 1 tonnes . It was bipedal , walking on stout hindlimbs , its horizontal torso balanced by a horizontal tail . Its forelimbs were short , though very robust . Megalosaurus had a rather large head , equipped with long curved teeth . It was generally a robust and heavily muscled animal .

 = = = " Scrotum humanum " = = = 
 Megalosaurus may have been the first dinosaur , apart from modern birds , to be described in the scientific literature . Part of a bone was recovered from the Taynton Limestone Formation of Stonesfield limestone quarry , Oxfordshire in 1676 . Sir Thomas <unk> gave the fragment to Robert Plot , Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oxford and first curator of the Ashmolean Museum , who published a description and illustration in his Natural History of Oxfordshire in 1676 . It was the first illustration of a dinosaur bone published . Plot correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the thighbone or femur of a large animal and he recognized that it was too large to belong to any species known to be living in England . He therefore at first concluded it to be the thighbone of a Roman war elephant and later that of a giant human , such as those mentioned in the Bible . The bone has since been lost , but the illustration is detailed enough that some have since identified it as that of Megalosaurus . 
 It has also been argued that this possible Megalosaurus bone was given the very first species name ever applied to an extinct dinosaur . Plot 's engraving of the Cornwell bone was again used in a book by Richard Brookes in 1763 . Brookes , in a caption , called it " Scrotum <unk> , " apparently comparing its appearance to a pair of " human testicles " . In 1970 , paleontologist Lambert Beverly Halstead pointed out that the similarity of Scrotum humanum to a modern species name , a so @-@ called Linnaean " <unk> " that has two parts , was not a coincidence . Linnaeus , the founder of modern taxonomy , had in the eighteenth century not merely devised a system for naming living creatures , but also for classifying geological objects . The book by Brookes was all about applying this latter system to curious stones found in England . According to Halstead , Brookes thus had deliberately used binomial nomenclature , and had in fact indicated the possible type specimen of a new biological genus . According to the rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) , the name Scrotum humanum in principle had priority over Megalosaurus because it was published first . That Brookes understood that the stone did not actually represent of pair of petrified testicles , was irrelevant . Merely the fact that the name had not been used in subsequent literature meant that it could be removed from competition for priority , because the ICZN states that if a name has never been considered valid after 1899 , it can be made a nomen oblitum , an invalid " forgotten name " . 
 In 1993 , after the death of Halstead , his friend William A.S. Sarjeant submitted a petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature to formally suppress the name Scrotum in favour of Megalosaurus . He wrote that the supposed junior synonym Megalosaurus bucklandii should be made a conserved name to ensure its priority . However , the Executive Secretary of the ICZN at the time , Philip K. Tubbs , did not consider the petition to be admissible , concluding that the term " Scrotum humanum " , published merely as a label for an illustration , did not constitute the valid creation of a new name , and stated that there was no evidence it was ever intended as such . Furthermore , the partial femur was too incomplete to definitely be referred to Megalosaurus and not a different , contemporary theropod . 
 = = = Buckland 's research = = = 
 During the last part of the eighteenth century , the number of fossils in British collections quickly increased . According to an hypothesis published by science historian Robert William Theodor Gunther in 1925 , among them was a partial lower jaw of Megalosaurus , acquired in October 1797 by Christopher Pegge for <unk> and added to the collection of the Anatomy School of Christ Church college . 
 In the early nineteenth century , more discoveries were made . In 1815 , John Kidd reported the find of bones of giant tetrapods , again at the Stonesfield quarry . The layers there are currently considered part of the Taynton Limestone Formation , dating to the mid @-@ Bathonian stage of the Jurassic Period . The bones were apparently acquired by William Buckland , Professor of Geology at the University of Oxford and dean of Christ Church . Buckland also studied a lower jaw , according to Gunther the one bought by Pegge . Buckland did not know to what animal the bones belonged but , in 1818 , after the Napoleonic Wars , the French comparative anatomist Georges Cuvier visited Buckland in Oxford and realised that they were those of a giant lizard @-@ like creature . Buckland further studied the remains with his friend William Conybeare who in 1821 referred to them as the " Huge Lizard " . In 1822 Buckland and Conybeare , in a joint article to be included in Cuvier 's <unk> , intended to provide scientific names for both gigantic lizard @-@ like creatures known at the time : the remains found near Maastricht would be named Mosasaurus – then seen as a land @-@ dwelling animal – while for the British lizard Conybeare had devised the name Megalosaurus , from the Greek μέγας , megas , " large " . That year a publication failed to occur , but the physician James Parkinson already in 1822 announced the name Megalosaurus , illustrating one of the teeth and revealing the creature was forty feet long and eight feet high . It is generally considered the name in 1822 was still a nomen nudum ( " naked name " ) . Buckland , urged on by an impatient Cuvier , continued to work on the subject during 1823 , letting his later wife Mary Morland provide drawings of the bones , that were to be the basis of illustrating <unk> . Finally , on 20 February 1824 , during the same meeting of the Geological Society of London in which Conybeare described a very complete specimen of Plesiosaurus , Buckland formally announced Megalosaurus . The descriptions of the bones in the Transactions of the Geological Society , in 1824 , constitute a valid publication of the name . Megalosaurus was the first non @-@ avian dinosaur genus named ; the first of which the remains had with certainty been scientifically described was Streptospondylus , in 1808 by Cuvier . 
 By 1824 , the material available to Buckland consisted of specimen OUM <unk> , a piece of a right lower jaw with a single erupted tooth ; OUM <unk> , a posterior dorsal vertebra ; OUM <unk> , an anterior caudal vertebra ; OUM <unk> , a sacrum of five sacral vertebrae ; OUM <unk> , a cervical rib ; OUM <unk> , a rib ; OUM <unk> , an ilium of the pelvis , OUM <unk> , a piece of the pubic bone ; OUM <unk> , a part of the ischium ; OUM <unk> , a thighbone and OUM <unk> , the lower part of a second metatarsal . As he himself was aware , these did not all belong to the same individual ; only the sacrum was articulated . Because they represented several individuals , the described fossils formed a syntype series . By modern standards , from these a single specimen has to be selected to serve as the type specimen on which the name is based . In 1990 , Ralph Molnar chose the famous dentary ( front part of the lower jaw ) , OUM <unk> , as such a lectotype . Because he was unaccustomed to the deep dinosaurian pelvis , much taller than with typical reptiles , Buckland misidentified several bones , interpreting the pubic bone as a fibula and mistaking the ischium for a clavicle . Buckland identified the organism as being a giant animal belonging to the Sauria – the Lizards , at the time seen as including the crocodiles – and he placed it in the new genus Megalosaurus , repeating an estimate by Cuvier that the largest pieces he described , indicated an animal twelve metres long in life . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 Buckland had not provided a specific name , as was not uncommon in the early nineteenth century , when the genus was still seen as the more essential concept . In 1826 , Ferdinand von Ritgen gave this dinosaur a complete binomial , Megalosaurus <unk> , which however was not much used by later authors and is now considered a nomen oblitum . A year later , in 1827 , Gideon Mantell included Megalosaurus in his geological survey of southeastern England , and assigned the species its current valid binomial name , Megalosaurus bucklandii . Until recently , the form Megalosaurus <unk> was often used , a variant first published in 1832 by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer – and sometimes erroneously ascribed to von Ritgen – but the more original M. bucklandii has priority . 
 = = = Later finds of Megalosaurus bucklandii = = = 
 The quarries at Stonesfield , which were worked until 1911 , continued to produce Megalosaurus bucklandii fossils , mostly single bones from the pelvis and hindlimbs . Vertebrae and skull bones are rare . In 2010 , Roger Benson counted a total of 103 specimens from the Stonesfield Slate , from a minimum of seven individuals . It has been contentious whether this material represents just a single taxon . In 2004 , Julia Day and Paul Barrett claimed that there were two <unk> present , based on small differences in the thighbones . In 2008 Benson favoured this idea , but in 2010 concluded the differences were illusory . A maxilla fragment , specimen OUM <unk> , was , in 1869 assigned , by Thomas Huxley , to M. bucklandii . In 1992 Robert Thomas Bakker claimed it represented a member of the <unk> ; in 2007 , Darren Naish thought it was a separate species belonging to the Abelisauroidea . In 2010 , Benson pointed out that the fragment was basically indistinguishable from other known M. bucklandii maxillae , to which it had in fact not been compared by the other authors . 
 Apart from the finds in the Taynton Limestone Formation , in 1939 Sidney Hugh Reynolds referred remains to Megalosaurus that had been found in the older Chipping Norton Limestone Formation dating from the early Bathonian , about thirty single teeth and bones . Though the age disparity makes it problematic to assume an identity with Megalosaurus bucklandii , in 2009 Benson could not establish any relevant anatomical differences with M. bucklandii among the remains found at one site , the New Park Quarry , and therefore affirmed the reference to that species . However , in another site , the Oakham Quarry , the material contained one bone , an ilium , that was clearly dissimilar . 
 Sometimes trace fossils have been referred to Megalosaurus or to the ichnogenus <unk> . In 1997 , a famous group of fossilised footprints ( <unk> ) was found in a limestone quarry at Ardley , twenty kilometres northeast of Oxford . They were thought to have been made by Megalosaurus and possibly also some left by Cetiosaurus . There are replicas of some of these footprints , set across the lawn of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History . One track was of a theropod accelerating from walking to running . According to Benson , such referrals are unprovable , as the tracks show no traits unique to Megalosaurus . Certainly they should be limited to finds that are of the same age as Megalosaurus bucklandii . 
 Finds from sites outside England , especially in France , have in the nineteenth and twentieth century been referred to M. bucklandii . In 2010 Benson considered these as either clearly different or too fragmentary to establish an identity . In 2014 , fossils from the Philippines were identified as dinosaurian in nature , and American palaeontologist John J. Flynn suspected that they belonged to Megalosaurus .

 = = = Early reconstructions = = = 
 The first reconstruction was given by Buckland himself . He considered Megalosaurus to be a quadruped . He thought it was an " amphibian " , i.e. an animal capable of both swimming in the sea and walking on land . Generally , in his mind Megalosaurus resembled a gigantic lizard , but Buckland already understood from the form of the thighbone head that the legs were not so much sprawling as held rather upright . In the original description of 1824 , Buckland repeated Cuvier 's size estimate that Megalosaurus would have been forty feet long with the weight of a seven foot tall elephant . However , this had been based on the remains present at Oxford . Buckland had also been hurried into naming his new reptile by a visit he had made to the fossil collection of Mantell , who during the lecture announced to have acquired a fossil thighbone of enormous magnitude , twice as long as that just described . Today , this is known to have belonged to Iguanodon , or at least some <unk> , but at the time both men assumed this bone belonged to Megalosaurus also . Even taking into account the effects of allometry , heavier animals having relatively stouter bones , Buckland was forced in the printed version of his lecture to estimate the maximum length of Megalosaurus at sixty to seventy feet . The existence of Megalosaurus posed some problems for christian orthodoxy , which typically held that suffering and death had only come into the world through Original Sin , which seemed irreconcilable with the presence of a gigantic devouring reptile during a pre @-@ <unk> phase of history . Buckland rejected the usual solution , that such carnivores would originally have been peaceful vegetarians , as infantile and claimed in one of the Bridgewater Treatises that Megalosaurus had played a beneficial rôle in creation by ending the lives of old and ill animals , " to diminish the aggregate amount of animal suffering " . 
 Around 1840 , it became fashionable in England to espouse the concept of the transmutation of species as part of a general progressive development through time , as expressed in the work of Robert Chambers . In reaction , on 2 August 1841 Richard Owen during a lecture to the British Association for the Advancement of Science claimed that certain prehistoric reptilian groups had already attained the organisational level of present mammals , implying there had been no progress . Owen presented three examples of such higher level reptiles : Iguanodon , Hylaeosaurus and Megalosaurus . For these , the " lizard model " was entirely abandoned : they would have had an upright stance and a high metabolism . This also meant that earlier size estimates had been exaggerated . By simply adding the known length of the vertebrae , instead of extrapolating from a lizard , Owen arrived at a total body length for Megalosaurus of thirty feet . In the printed version of the lecture published in 1842 , Owen united the three reptiles into a separate group : the Dinosauria . Megalosaurus was thus one of the three original dinosaurs . 
 In 1852 , Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins was commissioned to build a life @-@ sized concrete model of Megalosaurus for the exhibition of prehistoric animals at the Crystal Palace Park in Sydenham , where it remains to this day . Hawkins worked under the direction of Owen and the statue reflected Owen 's ideas that Megalosaurus would have been a mammal @-@ like quadruped . The sculpture in Crystal Palace Park shows a conspicuous hump on the shoulders and it has been suggested this was inspired by a set of high vertebral spines acquired by Owen in the early 1850s . Today , they are seen as a separate genus <unk> , but Owen referred them to Megalosaurus . The models at the exhibition created a general public awareness for the first time , at least in England , that ancient reptiles had existed . 
 The presumption that carnivorous dinosaurs , like Megalosaurus , were quadrupeds was first challenged by the find of Compsognathus in 1859 . That , however , was a very small animal , the significance of which for gigantic forms could be denied . In 1870 , near Oxford , the type specimen of Eustreptospondylus was discovered - the first reasonably intact skeleton of a large theropod . It was clearly bipedal . Shortly afterwards , John Phillips created the first public display of a theropod skeleton in Oxford , arranging the known Megalosaurus bones , held by recesses in cardboard sheets , in a more or less natural position . During the 1870s , North American discoveries of large theropods , like Allosaurus , confirmed that they were bipedal . The Oxford University Museum of Natural History display contains most of the specimens from the original description by Buckland .

 = = = = Diagnosis = = = = 
 For decades after its discovery , Megalosaurus was seen by researchers as the definitive or typical large carnivorous dinosaur . As a result , it began to function as a wastebasket taxon , and many large or small carnivorous dinosaurs from Europe and elsewhere were assigned to the genus . This slowly changed during the 20th century , when it became common to restrict the genus to fossils found in the middle Jurassic of England . Further restriction occurred in the late 20th and early 21st centuries , researchers such as Ronan Allain and Dan Chure suggesting that the Stonesfield Slate fossils perhaps belonged to several , possibly not directly related , species of theropod dinosaur . Subsequent research seemed to confirm this hypothesis , and the genus Megalosaurus and species M. bucklandii became generally regarded as limited to the taxon having produced the lectotype , the dentary of the lower jaw . Furthermore , several researchers failed to find any characteristics in that jaw that could be used to distinguish Megalosaurus from its relatives , which would mean the genus were a nomen dubium . However , a comprehensive study by Roger Benson and colleagues in 2008 , and several related analyses published in subsequent years , overturned the previous consensus by identifying several autapomorphies , or unique distinguishing characteristics , in the lower jaw that could be used to separate Megalosaurus from other megalosaurids . 
 Various distinguishing traits of the lower jaw have been established . The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide . The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged . Seen from above , the dentary is straight without an expanded jaw tip . The interdental plates , reinforcing the teeth from behind , of the lower jaw are tall . Benson also concluded it would be most parsimonious to assume that the Stonesfield Slate material represents a single species . If so , several additional distinctive traits can be observed in other parts of the skeleton . The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium , above the hip joint , shows parallel vertical grooves . The bony skirts between the shafts of the ischia are thick and touch each other forming an almost flat surface . There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface . The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel . A ridge on the upper side of the third metatarsal connected to a groove in the side of the second metatarsal . The middle of the front edge of the scapula forms a thin crest .

 Since the first finds , many other Megalosaurus bones have been recovered ; however , no complete skeleton has yet been found . Therefore , the details of its physical appearance cannot be certain . However , a full osteology of all known material was published in 2010 by Benson . 
 = = = = = Size = = = = = 
 Traditionally , most texts , following Owen 's estimate of 1841 , give a body length of thirty feet or nine metres for Megalosaurus . The lack of an articulated dorsal vertebral series makes it difficult to determine an exact size . David Bruce Norman in 1984 thought Megalosaurus was seven to eight metres long . Gregory S. Paul in 1988 estimated the weight tentatively at 1 @.@ 1 tonnes , given a thighbone seventy @-@ six centimetres long . The trend in the early twenty @-@ first century to limit the material to the lectotype inspired even lower estimates , disregarding outliers of uncertain identity . Paul in 2010 stated Megalosaurus was six metres long and seven hundred kilogrammes heavy . However , the same year Benson claimed that Megalosaurus , though medium @-@ sized , was still among the largest of Middle Jurassic theropods . Specimen BMNH 31806 , a thighbone 803 millimetres long , would indicate a body weight of 943 kilogrammes , using the extrapolation method of J.F. Anderson — which method , optimised for mammals , tends to underestimate theropod masses by at least a third . Furthermore , thighbone specimen OUM <unk> has a length of about eighty @-@ six centimetres .

 In general , Megalosaurus had the typical build of a large theropod . It was bipedal , the horizontal torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail . The hindlimbs were long and strong with three forward @-@ facing weight @-@ bearing toes , the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally robust and probably carrying three digits . Being a carnivore , its large elongated head bore long dagger @-@ like teeth to slice the flesh of its prey . The skeleton of Megalosaurus is highly ossified , indicating a robust and muscular animal , though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of Torvosaurus , a close relative . 
 = = = = = Skull and lower jaws = = = = = 
 The skull of Megalosaurus is poorly known . The discovered skull elements are generally rather large in relation to the rest of the material . This can either be coincidental or indicate that Megalosaurus had an uncommonly large head . The praemaxilla is not known , making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular . A rather stubby snout is suggested by the fact that the front branch of the maxilla was short . In the depression around the antorbital fenestra to the front , a smaller non @-@ piercing hollowing can be seen that is probably homologous to the fenestra <unk> . The maxilla bears thirteen teeth . The teeth are relatively large , with a crown length up to seven centimetres . The teeth are supported from behind by tall , triangular , unfused interdental plates . The cutting edges bear eighteen to twenty <unk> per centimetre . The tooth formula is probably 4 , 13 – 14 / 13 – 14 . The jugal bone is pneumatised , pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra . It was probably hollowed out by an outgrowth of an air sac in the nasal bone . Such a level of <unk> of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate autapomorphy . 
 The lower jaw is rather robust . It is also straight in top view , without much expansion at the jaw tip , suggesting the lower jaws as a pair , the <unk> , were narrow . Several traits in 2008 identified as autapomorphies , later transpired to have been the result of damage . However , a unique combination of traits is present in the wide longitudinal groove on the outer side ( shared with Torvosaurus ) , the small third dentary tooth and a vascular channel , below the row of interdental plates , that only is closed from the fifth tooth position onwards . The number of dentary teeth was probably thirteen or fourteen , though the preserved damaged specimens show at most eleven tooth sockets . The interdental plates have smooth inner sides , whereas those of the maxilla are vertically grooved ; the same combination is shown by Piatnitzkysaurus . The surangular has no bony shelf , or even ridge , on its outer side . There is laterally an oval opening present in front of the jaw joint , a foramen <unk> posterior , but a second foramen <unk> anterior to the front of it is lacking . 
 = = = = = Vertebral column = = = = = 
 Although the exact numbers are unknown , the vertebral column of Megalosaurus was probably divided into ten neck vertebrae , thirteen dorsal vertebrae , five sacral vertebrae and fifty to sixty tail vertebrae , as is common for basal Tetanurae . 
 The Stonesfield Slate material contains no neck vertebrae ; but a single broken anterior cervical vertebra is known from the New Park Quarry , specimen BMNH <unk> . The breakage reveals large internal air chambers . The vertebra is also otherwise heavily pneumatised , with large pleurocoels , pneumatic excavations , on its sides . The rear facet of the centrum is strongly concave . The neck ribs are short . The front dorsal vertebrae are slightly opisthocoelous , with convex front centrum facets and concave rear centrum facets . They are also deeply keeled , with the ridge on the underside representing about 50 % of the total centrum height . The front dorsals perhaps have a <unk> above the <unk> , the lower rib joint process . The rear dorsal vertebrae , according to Benson , are not pneumatised . They are slightly amphicoelous , with hollow centrum facets . They have secondary joint processes , forming a hyposphene – <unk> complex , the hyposphene having a triangular transverse cross @-@ section . The height of the dorsal spines of the rear dorsals is unknown , but a high spine on a tail vertebra of the New Park Quarry material , specimen BMNH <unk> , suggests the presence of a crest on the hip area . The spines of the five vertebrae of the sacrum form a supraneural plate , fused at the top . The undersides of the sacral vertebrae are rounded but the second sacral is keeled ; normally it is the third or fourth sacral having a ridge . The sacral vertebrae seem not to be pneumatised but have excavations at their sides . The tail vertebrae are slightly amphicoelous , with hollow centrum facets on both the front and rear side . They have excavations at their sides and a longitudinal groove on the underside . The neural spines of the tail basis are transversely thin and tall , representing more than half of the total vertebral height .

 The shoulderblade or scapula is short and wide , its length about 6 @.@ 8 times the minimum width ; this is a rare and basal trait within Tetanurae . Its top curves slightly to the rear in side view . On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present , running from just below the shoulder joint to about <unk> where it gradually merges with the blade surface . The middle front edge over about 30 % of its length is thinned forming a slightly protruding crest . The scapula constitutes about half of the shoulder joint , which is oriented obliquely sideways and to below . The coracoid is in all known specimens fused with the scapula into a <unk> , lacking a visible suture . The coracoid as such is an oval bone plate , with its longest side attached to the scapula . It is pierced by a large oval foramen but the usual boss for the attachment of the upper arm muscles is lacking . 
 The humerus is very robust with strongly expanded upper and lower ends . <unk> specimen OUMNH <unk> has a length of 388 millimetres . Its shaft circumference equals about half of the total humerus length . The humerus head continues to the front and the rear into large bosses , together forming a massive bone plate . On the front outer side of the shaft a large triangular deltopectoral crest is present , the attachment for the Musculus pectoralis major and the Musculus <unk> . It covers about the upper half of the shaft length , its apex positioned rather low . The ulna is extremely robust , for its absolute size more heavily built than with any other known member of the Tetanurae . The only known specimen , BMNH <unk> , has a length of 232 millimetres and a minimal shaft circumference of 142 millimetres . The ulna is straight in front view and has a large olecranon , the attachment process for the Musculus triceps brachii . Radius , wrist and hand are unknown . 
 In the pelvis , the ilium is long and low , with a convex upper profile . Its front blade is triangular and rather short ; at the front end there is a small drooping point , separated by a notch from the pubic peduncle . The rear blade is roughly rectangular . The outer side of the ilium is concave , serving as an attachment surface for the Musculus <unk> , the main thigh muscle . Above the hip joint , on this surface a low vertical ridge is present with conspicuous vertical grooves . The bottom of the rear blade is excavated by a narrow but deep trough forming a bony shelf for the attachment of the Musculus caudofemoralis brevis . The outer side of the rear blade does not match the inner side , which thus can be seen as a separate " medial blade " that in side view is visible in two places : in the corner between outer side and the ischial peduncle and as a small surface behind the extreme rear tip of the outer side of the rear blade . The pubic bone is straight . The pubic bones of both pelvis halves are connected via narrow bony skirts that originated at a rather high position on the rear side and continued downwards to a point low on the front side of the shaft . The ischium is S @-@ shaped in side view , showing at the transition point between the two curvatures a rough boss on the outer side . On the front edge of the ischial shaft an obturator process is present in the form of a low ridge , at its top separated from the shaft by a notch . To below , this ridge continues into an exceptionally thick bony skirt at the inner rear side of the shaft , covering over half of its length . Towards the end of the shaft , this skirt gradually merges with it . The shaft eventually ends in a sizeable " foot " with a convex lower profile . 
 The thighbone is straight in front view . Seen from the same direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft , seen from above it is orientated 20 ° to the front . The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it , by a fissure . At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present . At the lower end of the thighbone a distinct front , extensor , groove separates the condyles . At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge , a typical <unk> trait . The shinbone , or tibia , is relatively straight , slightly curving inwards . To below , its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear , resulting in a generally oval cross @-@ section . For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus . Of the foot , only the second , third and fourth metatarsals are known , the bone elements that were connected to the three weight @-@ bearing toes . They are straight and robust , showing ligament pits at their lower sides . The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end , resulting in a more flexible joint , allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement . The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal , causing a tighter connection .

 In 1824 , Buckland assigned Megalosaurus to the Sauria , assuming within the Sauria a close affinity with modern lizards , more than with crocodiles . In 1842 , Owen made Megalosaurus one of the first three genera placed in the Dinosauria . In 1850 , Prince Charles Lucien Bonaparte coined a separate family Megalosauridae with Megalosaurus as the type genus . For a long time , the precise relationships of Megalosaurus remained vague . It was seen as a " primitive " member of the Carnosauria , the group in which most large theropods were united . 
 In the late 20th century the new method of cladistics allowed for the first time to exactly calculate how close various taxa were related to each other . In 2012 , Matthew Carrano et al. showed that Megalosaurus was the sister species of Torvosaurus within the <unk> , giving this cladogram : 
 = = Paleobiology = = 
 Living in what is now Europe , during the Jurassic Period ( ~ 201 to ~ 145 million years ago ) , Megalosaurus may have hunted stegosaurs and sauropods . Repeated descriptions during the nineteenth and early twentieth century of Megalosaurus hunting Iguanodon ( another of the earliest dinosaurs named ) through the forests that then covered the continent are now known to be inaccurate , because Iguanodon skeletons are found in much younger Early Cretaceous formations . The only specimens belonging to Megalosaurus bucklandii are from the Lower / Middle Bathonian of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire . No material from outside of the Bathonian formations of England can be referred to Megalosaurus . It lived alongside the theropods <unk> , Iliosuchus and Streptospondylus , and the sauropods <unk> , Cetiosaurus , and possibly Cetiosauriscus . The pterosaur <unk> , and indeterminate sauropod and ornithopod remains have also been found alongside fossils of Megalosaurus . 
 Benson in 2010 concluded from its size and common distribution that Megalosaurus was the apex predator of its habitat . He saw the absence of Cetiosaurus on the French <unk> Massif as an indication that Megalosaurus too did not live on that island and was limited to the London @-@ Brabant Massif . 
 = = = Paleopathology = = = 
 A Megalosaurus rib figured in 1856 and 1884 by Sir Richard Owen has a pathological swollen spot near the base of its capitular process . The swollen spot appears to have been caused by a healed fracture and is located at the point where it would have articulated with its vertebra . 
 = = Species and synonyms = = 
 During the later nineteenth century , Megalosaurus was seen as the typical carnivorous dinosaur . If remains were found that were not deemed sufficiently distinct to warrant a separate genus , often single teeth , these were classified under Megalosaurus , which thus began to function as a wastebasket taxon , a sort of default genus . Eventually , Megalosaurus contained more species than any other non @-@ avian dinosaur genus , most of them of dubious validity . During the twentieth century , this practice was gradually discontinued ; but scientists discovering theropods that had been mistakenly classified under a different animal group in older literature , still felt themselves forced to rename them , again choosing Megalosaurus as the default generic name . 
 = = = Generic lapsus calami = = = 
 The first published lapsus calami of Megalosaurus was named in 1913 . Ameghino added a letter , a " u " , into Megalosaurus . In doing so , he named a new genus , <unk> , only to create a synonym of Megalosaurus . In 1926 , von Huene published and article on a new species . In the paper , he misspelt the genus Megalosaurus four times . These misspellings were <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Each time , he created a new synonym of Megalosaurus . Later , in 1964 , Walker created another lapsus calami of Megalosaurus . This time , the " g " in its name was accidentally replaced with a " q " , erecting <unk> .

 In 1857 , Joseph Leidy renamed Deinodon horridus ( Leidy , 1856 ) into Megalosaurus horridus , the " frightening one " , a genus based on teeth . In 1858 , Friedrich August Quenstedt named Megalosaurus <unk> , based on a probable Late Triassic theropod tooth found near <unk> , specimen <unk> <unk> . It is a nomen dubium . In 1869 Eugène Eudes @-@ <unk> named Megalosaurus insignis , the " insignificant " , based on a theropod tooth found near La <unk> in Normandy , having only a third of the height of the M. bucklandii tooth . The name at first remained a nomen nudum , but a description was provided , in 1870 , by Gustave <unk> . Today , it is considered a nomen dubium , an indeterminate member of the Theropoda , the specimen having in 1944 been destroyed by a bombardment . In 1870 , Jean @-@ Baptiste <unk> named Megalosaurus meriani based on specimen MH 350 , a premaxillary tooth found near <unk> and part of the collection of Peter Merian . Today , this is either referred to Ceratosaurus or seen as a nomen dubium , an indeterminate member of the Ceratosauria . In 1871 , Emanuel <unk> named remains found near <unk> Megalosaurus <unk> . It is a nomen nudum , the fossils possibly belonging to <unk> maximus . In 1876 , J. Henry , a science teacher at Besançon , in a published dissertation named four Late Triassic possible dinosaur teeth found near <unk> Megalosaurus obtusus , " the blunt one " . It is a nomen dubium , perhaps a theropod or some indeterminate predatory archosaur . In 1881 , Harry Govier Seeley named two possible theropod teeth found in Austria Megalosaurus <unk> . The specific name refers to Pannonia . It is a nomen dubium , possibly an indeterminate member of the Dromaeosauridae or Tyrannosauroidea . In 1883 , Seeley named Megalosaurus <unk> , based on a thighbone , specimen BMNH <unk> found near Maastricht , the Netherlands . The specific name honours Jacob <unk> <unk> van Breda . In 1932 , this was made a separate genus <unk> by Friedrich von Huene . 
 In 1882 , Henri @-@ Émile Sauvage named remains found at <unk> @-@ le @-@ Château , teeth and vertebrae from the Early Cretaceous , Megalosaurus superbus , " the proud one " . In 1923 , this became the genus <unk> . In 1884 / 1885 , Wilhelm <unk> Dames , based on specimen UM 84 , a tooth from the Early Cretaceous , named Megalosaurus <unk> , the specific name honouring Wilhelm Dunker . In 1923 , this was made a separate genus Altispinax . In 1885 , Joseph Henri Ferdinand <unk> renamed <unk> gracilis Quenstedt 1885 into Megalosaurus gracilis . Today the renaming is generally rejected . In 1889 , Richard Lydekker named Megalosaurus oweni , the specific name honouring Owen , based on a series of metatarsals from the Early Cretaceous , specimen BMNH <unk> . In 1991 , this was made a separate genus <unk> . In 1892 , Edward Drinker Cope renamed Ceratosaurus nasicornis Marsh 1884 into Megalosaurus nasicornis . This had been largely motivated by a desire to annoy his rival Othniel Charles Marsh and the name has found no acceptance . In 1896 , Charles Jean Julien Depéret named Megalosaurus crenatissimus , " the much crenelated " , based on remains from the Late Cretaceous found in Madagascar . In 1955 this was made a separate genus Majungasaurus . The generic name Laelaps , used by Cope to denote a theropod , had been preoccupied by a mite . Marsh had therefore provided the replacement name Dryptosaurus , but Henry Fairfield Osborn , a partisan of Cope , rejected this replacement and thus in 1898 renamed Laelaps aquilunguis Cope 1866 into Megalosaurus aquilunguis .

 In 1901 Baron Franz Nopcsa renamed Laelaps <unk> Cope 1877 into Megalosaurus <unk> . In the same publication Nopcsa renamed Poekilopleuron valens Leidy 1870 into Megalosaurus valens ; this probably represents fossil material of Allosaurus . In 1902 , Nopcsa named Megalosaurus <unk> based on two teeth found in Transylvania , then part of the Kingdom of Hungary . The specimens , <unk> ob . <unk> , were later lost . It represents an indeterminate theropod . In 1903 , Louis Dollo named Megalosaurus <unk> based on a manual claw found near <unk> in Belgium . He had first reported this claw in 1883 , and as a result some sources by mistake indicate this year as the date of the naming . It perhaps represents a member of the Noasauridae , or an indeterminate member of the Coelurosauria . In 1907 / 1908 , von Huene renamed Streptospondylus cuvieri Owen 1842 , based on a presently lost partial vertebra , into Megalosaurus cuvieri . This is today seen as a nomen dubium , an indeterminate member of the Tetanurae . In 1909 , Richard Lydekker named Megalosaurus woodwardi , based on a maxilla with tooth , specimen BMNH <unk> . This is today seen as a nomen dubium , an indeterminate member of the Theropoda . 
 In 1910 , Arthur Smith Woodward named Megalosaurus bradleyi based on a skull from the Middle Jurassic , the specific name honouring the collector F. Lewis Bradley . In 1926 , this was made a separate genus Proceratosaurus . In 1920 , Werner Janensch named Megalosaurus ingens , " the enormous " , based on specimen MB R 1050 , a twelve centimetre long tooth from German East Africa . It possibly represents a large member of the Carcharodontosauridae ; Carrano e.a. saw it as an indeterminate member of the Tetanurae . In 1923 , von Huene renamed Poekilopleuron bucklandii Eudes @-@ <unk> 1838 into Megalosaurus <unk> . Today , the genus Poekilopleuron is generally seen as valid . In the same publication , von Huene named two additional Megalosaurus species . The first was Megalosaurus <unk> , its specific name honouring William Kitchen Parker and based on a pelvis , leg bones and vertebrae from the Late Cretaceous . This was made the separate genus <unk> in 1964 . The second was Megalosaurus <unk> , named after its provenance from <unk> and based on two dentaries , leg bones , a pelvis and vertebrae from the Middle Jurassic , which von Huene himself in 1932 made the separate genus Magnosaurus . In 1925 , Depéret , based on two teeth from Algeria , named Megalosaurus <unk> . In 1931 / 1932 this was made the separate genus Carcharodontosaurus . In 1956 von Huene by mistake named the same species as Megalosaurus africanus , intending to base it on remains from Morocco but referring the Algerian teeth ; this implies that M. africanus is a junior objective synonym of M. <unk> . In 1926 , von Huene named Megalosaurus <unk> , its specific name honouring Richard Lydekker , based on BMNH <unk> , i.e. the same specimen that had already been made the holotype of M. woodwardi ( Lydekker , 1909 ) . This implies that M. <unk> is a junior objective synonym of M. woodwardi . It is likewise seen as a nomen dubium . In the same publication von Huene named Megalosaurus <unk> based on three teeth found near <unk> , its specific name honouring <unk> <unk> . It is seen as a nomen dubium , the fossil material probably representing some member of the <unk> or some other archosaur . In 1932 , a work by von Huene mentioned a Megalosaurus ( Magnosaurus ) woodwardi , a synonym of Magnosaurus woodwardi named in the same book . Its type specimen is differing from the earlier Megalosaurus woodwardi ( Lydekker , 1909 ) , the two names are not synonyms . In 1954 Samuel Welles named Megalosaurus <unk> . This species is exceptional in being based on a rather complete skeleton , found in Arizona , from the Early Jurassic . Its specific name honours John Wetherill . In 1970 , Welles made this the separate genus Dilophosaurus . In 1955 , Albert @-@ Félix de Lapparent named Megalosaurus <unk> based on a series of twenty @-@ three vertebrae found near <unk> n <unk> in a layer of the El Mers Formation of Morocco . This probably represents a member of the <unk> . In 1956 , Alfred Sherwood Romer renamed <unk> nicaeensis <unk> 1913 , based on a lower jaw found near Nice , on the authority of von Huene into Megalosaurus nicaeensis . Originally it had been considered to be some crocodilian ; present opinion confirms this . In 1957 , de Lapparent named Megalosaurus <unk> based on three teeth found near Pombal in the Jurassic of Portugal . Today it is seen as a nomen dubium , an indeterminate member of the Theropoda . 
 In 1965 , Oskar Kuhn renamed <unk> <unk> Jaekel 1910 into Megalosaurus ? <unk> . It is a nomen dubium based on the tooth of some indeterminate predatory Triassic archosaur , found in Silesia , perhaps a theropod . In 1966 , Guillermo del Corro named Megalosaurus <unk> , named " the unexpected " as it was discovered on a sauropod site with remains of <unk> , based on specimen MACN 18 @.@ 172 , a tooth found in Argentina . It might represent a member of the Carcharodontosauridae . In 1970 , Rodney Steel named two Megalosaurus species . Firstly , he renamed Iliosuchus <unk> Huene 1932 into Megalosaurus <unk> . Secondly , he renamed Nuthetes destructor Owen 1854 into Megalosaurus destructor . Both genera are today seen as not identical to Megalosaurus . Michael Waldman in 1974 renamed Sarcosaurus andrewsi Huene 1932 into Megalosaurus andrewsi . Indeed , Sarcosaurus andrewsi is today by some scientists not seen as directly related to the type species of Sarcosaurus : Sarcosaurus <unk> . In the same publication Waldman named Megalosaurus <unk> , " the western one " , based on skull fragments from the Middle Jurassic . In 2008 this was made the separate genus <unk> . Del Corro in 1974 named Megalosaurus chubutensis , based on specimen MACN 18 @.@ 189 , a tooth found in Chubut Province . It is a nomen dubium , a possible carcharodontosaurid , or a very large abelisaurid . 
 In 1985 , Zhao Xijin named two Megalosaurus species found in Tibet . He had earlier mentioned these species in an unpublished dissertation of 1983 , implying they initially were invalid nomina ex <unk> . However , his 1985 publication did not contain descriptions so the names are still nomina nuda . The first species was Megalosaurus <unk> , named for the <unk> Group . It was , in the second edition of The Dinosauria , by mistake spelled as Megalosaurus <unk> . The second species was Megalosaurus <unk> . In 1987 / 1988 , Monique Vianey @-@ Liaud renamed Massospondylus rawesi ( Lydekker , 1890 ) , based on specimen NHMUK <unk> , a tooth from the Maastrichtian of India , into Megalosaurus rawesi . This is a nomen dubium , a possible member of the Abelisauridae . In 1988 , Gregory S. Paul renamed Torvosaurus <unk> Galton & Jensen 1979 into Megalosaurus <unk> . The change has found no acceptance . In 1973 , Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky had renamed Poekilopleuron <unk> <unk> 1883 into a Megalosaurus sp . However , as it is formally impossible to change a named species into an unnamed one , George Olshevsky in 1991 used the new combination Megalosaurus <unk> . It is a chimaera . In 1993 , Ernst Probst and Raymund Windolf by mistake renamed Plateosaurus ornatus Huene 1905 into Megalosaurus ornatus by mentioning the latter name in a species list . This can be seen as a nomen <unk> . The same publication listed the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> & Lapparent 1974 as a Megalosaurus <unk> . In 1997 , Windolf renamed <unk> <unk> Münster 1846 , based on a tooth found near Hannover , into Megalosaurus <unk> . It is a nomen dubium , an indeterminate member of the Theropoda . In 1998 , Peter Malcolm Galton renamed <unk> cambrensis Newton 1899 , based on a left lower jaw , specimen BGS <unk> found at Bridgend , into ? Megalosaurus cambrensis because it was not a basal sauropodomorph . It is a senior synonym of <unk> cambrensis Olshevsky 1991 . The specific name refers to Cambria , the Latin name of Wales . It probably represents a member of the Coelophysoidea , or some other predatory archosaur .

If the name has been changed , they are placed in parentheses and the authors of the changed name are mentioned behind them . The list also indicates whether a name has been insufficiently described ( nomen nudum ) , is not taxonomically identifiable at the generic level ( nomen dubium ) , or fallen out of use ( nomen oblitum ) . <unk> under a different genus are mentioned behind the " = " sign ; if the reclassification is today considered valid , it is listed under Reassigned species .

 Decorating of the Bride is an oil painting by the Serbian artist Paja Jovanović . It shows a young Albanian bride in traditional attire being prepared for her upcoming marriage by the female members of her household . It is one of two compositions Jovanović painted on the subject , the other of which is considered lost . 
 The painting was done between 1885 and 1888 on one of Jovanović 's trips to the Balkans . It was painted for the French Gallery , with which Jovanović was under contract , and was well received by art critics and members of the public alike . It remained in the French Gallery 's possession until 1893 , when it was purchased by a London buyer . In 1935 , the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs purchased the work and bestowed it to the National Museum of Serbia , in whose possession it remains . In 2009 , the painting began undergoing restoration . 
 = = Description = = 
 Decorating of the Bride ( Serbian Latin : <unk> <unk> ; Serbian Cyrillic : <unk> <unk> ) measures 96 @.@ 5 by 136 centimetres ( 38 @.@ 0 in × 53 @.@ 5 in ) . The painting is set in an impoverished 19th @-@ century ethnic Albanian household . It shows the women of the family adorning a young bride . The jewelry that the bride is supposed to wear at her wedding is taken from an old wooden chest that can be seen in the left @-@ hand corner and is temporarily set against a copper tray beside her . Immediately next to the chest , a little girl holds another copper tray , which also contains several items of jewelry . Two elderly women attend to the bride . To the far right , young maidens fashion a garland of fresh flowers and joyfully whisper to one another . The room in which the women have gathered is sparsely furnished , with a low ceiling , well worn carpet and plain plastered walls . The bride wears traditional garb , with a gold necklace around her neck and delicately embroidered slippers on her feet . The artist 's signature , <unk> as P. <unk> , can be seen at the bottom right . 
 The painting has also been referred to as <unk> ( " The Bride " ) , Kite <unk> ( " The Bride is Being Decorated " ) and <unk> <unk> ( " Bridal Trousseau " ) . The artist did not assign titles to his works , as he felt that if a painting was well composed viewers would be able to deduce the title themselves . As such , the majority of his paintings are referred to by a number of different titles . 
 = = History = = 
 Paja Jovanović ( 1859 – 1957 ) was one of the most famous Serbian realists of the late 19th century . From 1877 to 1882 , he attended Vienna 's Academy of Fine Arts , studying under Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold Müller , among others . In the early part of his career , he composed mostly Orientalist paintings , which were in high demand at the time . The paintings were based on his own experiences in the Balkans , the Middle East and North Africa , and assured his fame among art connoisseurs in the West . 
 Decorating of the Bride is one of Jovanović 's Orientalist works , notable examples of which include The Wounded Montenegrin ( 1882 ) , Fencing Lesson ( 1883 ) and <unk> ( 1897 ) . The painting is undated , and it remains unknown exactly when it was composed . Petar Petrović , the curator of the National Museum of Serbia , dates it to ca . 1885 – 86 . Art historian Lilien Filipovitch @-@ Robinson writes that it was painted in 1888 . What is known for certain is that Jovanović painted it in the mid @-@ 1880s on one of his travels through the Balkans . One source contends that it was composed while the artist was visiting the Ottoman town of Shkodër , in present @-@ day Albania . Another version of the painting is said to have been created by the artist not long after the original , but is considered lost . An 1891 journal article describes this version as depicting two women decorating the bride , while to her left the bride 's mother clasps her hands and cries with joy . This version is said to have shown a girl on the verge of tears standing by a door to the far left . On the right , a woman and young girl could be seen offering gifts to the bride . During conservatory examinations in 2009 , it was discovered that Decorating of the Bride had been painted over a similar , earlier work . The artist appears to have shortened the right side of the canvas by about 7 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) , altered the appearance of the interior , and slightly modified the left side of the painting . Save for the shortened canvas length , the right side of the painting is identical to that in the final version . 
 Reproductive rights to the painting were acquired by Zagreb merchant Petar Nikolić shortly after its creation , and lithographic prints were published soon thereafter . The painting was owned by the French Gallery until 1893 , when it was purchased by a London buyer . In 1935 , the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs purchased the work and gave it to the National Museum of Serbia , in whose possession it remains . It is classified under inventory number 31 – 115 . The museum has been closed to the public since the early 2000s , pending renovation . This has not kept Jovanović 's works , including Decorating of the Bride , from being displayed at other venues , including the National Museum 's foyer , which is sometimes open to the public . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 Warm tonalities dominate the composition , which is painted in a series of long and short strokes and with even distribution of lighting . Filipovitch @-@ Robinson notes the intimate feel of the painting , which she attributes to Jovanović 's familiarity with Balkan life . " He was not a stranger to the scene , " she states . " He knew his cast of village characters , their interactions , attitudes and consequent expressions and body language .

 = First Battle of Newbury = 
 The First Battle of Newbury was a battle of the First English Civil War that was fought on 20 September 1643 between a Royalist army , under the personal command of King Charles , and a Parliamentarian force led by the Earl of Essex . Following a year of Royalist successes in which they took Banbury , Oxford and Reading without conflict before storming Bristol , the Parliamentarians were left without an effective army in the field . When Charles laid siege to Gloucester , Parliament was forced to muster a force under Essex with which to beat Charles 's forces off . After a long march , Essex surprised the Royalists and forced them away from Gloucester before beginning a retreat to London . Charles rallied his forces and pursued Essex , overtaking the Parliamentarian army at Newbury and forcing them to march past the Royalist force to continue their retreat . 
 Essex reacted by making a surprise attack on the Royalist lines at dawn , capturing several pieces of high ground and leaving Charles on the back foot . A series of Royalist attacks led to large number of casualties and the slow retreat of Essex 's force , which was driven from the central hill and almost encircled ; Essex succeeded in rallying his infantry , however , and pushed forward in a counter @-@ attack . The slowing of this counter @-@ attack in the face of the Royalist cavalry forced Essex to send for reinforcements , who , while marching to him , were attacked and forced to retreat . This left a hole in the Parliamentarian line , dividing the army into two wings through which the Royalists hoped to pass , splitting the Parliamentarians and allowing Charles 's troops to encircle and defeat the enemy . In line with this , the Royalists moved forward to press the attack , but were forced to halt by the London Trained Bands . With night falling , the battle ended , and both exhausted armies disengaged . The next morning , low on ammunition , the Royalists were forced to allow Essex to pass and continue his retreat to London . 
 Reasons for the Royalist defeat include shortage of ammunition , the relative lack of professionalism of their soldiers and the tactics of Essex , who compensated " for his much lamented paucity of cavalry by tactical ingenuity and firepower " , countering Rupert 's cavalry by driving them off with mass infantry formations . Although the numbers of casualties were relatively small ( 1 @,@ 300 Royalists and 1 @,@ 200 Parliamentarians ) , historians who have studied the battle consider it to be one of the most crucial of the First English Civil War , marking the high point of the Royalist advance and leading to the signing of the Solemn League and Covenant , which brought the Scottish Covenanters into the war on the side of Parliament and led to the eventual victory of the Parliamentarian cause . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the failure of Parliamentarian forces to gain a conclusive victory at the Battle of Edgehill in 1642 , the Royalist armies had advanced on London , capturing Banbury , Oxford and Reading without conflict . On 13 November they faced the Earl of Essex at the Battle of Turnham Green , with Charles 's advisers persuading him to retreat to Oxford and Reading . After Essex besieged Reading and Charles 's armies failed in their attempts to relieve the town , a stalemate occurred on the front ; Essex 's army could not directly engage with the Royalists at Oxford due to disease in the ranks , while Charles was prevented from advancing due to the exhaustion of supplies and ammunition after the failed expedition to Reading . Despite this setback , the war was turning increasingly in favour of the Royalists . The early months of 1643 saw a " crushing " defeat of the Parliamentarians at the Battle of <unk> Moor , while the Battle of Roundway Down left Parliament without an effective army in the west of England , the lack of which allowed the Royalists under Prince Rupert to storm Bristol with the western army and Oxford army . The result was that Parliamentarian forces were depleted and appeared to be losing ; Essex 's army was the only significant one left in the field , and it suffered from reduced morale due to the defeats inflicted on Parliament by Royalist forces elsewhere in the war . 
 = = = Bristol = = = 
 Despite this , Royalist forces were significantly depleted by the battle at Bristol . Suffering over 1 @,@ 000 men dead , and having exhausted their supplies , the armies were forced to regroup . Even considering this , the capture of Bristol is considered the high @-@ water mark for the Royalist cause during the First English Civil War . With the city captured , however , an immediate dispute occurred over who was to govern it , and this led to Charles travelling there on 1 August to take personal command of the Royalist forces . Upon arriving he called his council of war together to discuss their next move , the primary questions at hand being " first , whether the armies should be united , and march in one upon the next design . And then , what the design should be " . The western army , although still strong , refused to advance further to the east due to the presence of Parliamentarian forces within Dorset and Cornwall ; the army 's commanders felt that , if they tried to push for such a move , their forces would either mutiny or simply desert . 
 Because of this unrest , it was quickly resolved that the western army would remain an independent fighting force and remain in Dorset and Cornwall to " mop up " the remaining Parliamentarians . Accordingly , the western army , commanded by Lord Carnarvon , remained in the region , capturing Dorchester in a bloodless victory on 2 August . Prince Maurice left 1 @,@ 200 infantry and approximately 200 cavalry to garrison Bristol before marching to Dorchester and personally taking command . The greater issues were what to do with the Oxford army and what the " next design " of the Royalist campaign would be . Rupert 's strategy was to advance through the Severn Valley and capture Gloucester , which would allow Royalist forces in south Wales to reinforce Charles 's army and thus allow for an assault on London . Another faction , however , argued that London could be captured with the army as it was , and that Gloucester would serve as a distraction from the main goal of the campaign . 
 By 6 August , it was clear that Rupert 's strategy would be abandoned ; instead , an alternate means of capturing the city was considered . During the early stages of the war , the loyalty of combatants on both sides , particularly that of professional soldiers , had been flexible . Gloucester was led by Edward Massie , a non @-@ partisan mercenary who only took a job with the Parliamentarians after he was refused a significant Royalist command . At the same time , it was felt that there was " a strong if so far silent party of Royalist sympathisers in the city " , while the governor of Sudeley Castle was reporting that Gloucester 's soldiers had stated they would not resist a Royalist advance . Given this , the council of war decided to march on Gloucester – not to besiege it or capture it by force , but to capture it by having the governor betray the city beforehand . William Legge , who had served with Massie in the Bishops ' Wars , contacted him and asked him to " surrender Gloucester to his lawful sovereign " . Although this message was rebuffed , Legge 's messenger reported that he had met Massie a second time in secret , and had been asked to tell Legge that Massie was willing to surrender the town to the King . As a result of this , on 7 August Charles and the Oxford army marched to Gloucester . 
 = = = Gloucester = = = 
 Charles 's main force began marching on 7 August and reached the village of <unk> a day later ; however , Rupert 's cavalry screen had already advanced and taken the village . Charles himself did not accompany the force , but instead rode across the Cotswolds to <unk> , where he met reinforcements from Oxford on 9 August . On the morning of 10 August , the Royalist army marched to Gloucester itself and besieged the city with approximately 6 @,@ 000 infantry and 2 @,@ 500 cavalry . With the force assembled , Charles sent a group of heralds , escorted by 1 @,@ 000 musketeers , forward at approximately 2 : 00 pm , at which point they read out the King 's demands to a meeting of 26 local council and garrison officers , including Massie . The King 's announcement was that if the officers submitted , he would pardon all the officers , prohibit his army from causing any damage to the city , and leave only a small garrison behind . If they did not , he would take the city by force , and the inhabitants would be responsible " for all the calamities and miseries that must befall them " . Despite earlier claims that Massie would surrender , he did not ; a short time later , a refusal of the offer was drawn up and unanimously signed by the officers . The reasons for Massie 's failure to surrender the city , despite the feelers he put out to Royalist contacts , are unknown . 
 At this point , Charles called another council of war to discuss the situation . It was resolved that it was crucial that Gloucester was still to be taken ; if it was left in Parliamentarian hands , it would act as a break in lines of communication should the Royalists advance further east towards London . In addition , Charles 's personal reputation had been sullied – travelling so far and yet not taking Gloucester would impact on the respect and prestige accorded to him , about which he was " notoriously sensitive " . Based on reconnaissance , Charles 's officers were confident that the garrison 's food and ammunition would not last long ; they argued that the city could be taken in less than 10 days , with Parliament lacking an effective army to relieve the city . If Essex 's forces did not attack , the Royalists would take the city . If they did attack , they would be exhausted and , according to Royalist intelligence , far weaker than the Oxford army , allowing Charles to destroy Parliament 's one remaining significant force . 
 Under the direct command of the Earl of Forth , the Royalists laid siege to the city ; Rupert had suggested a direct assault , but this proposal was not adopted due to fears of high casualties . By 11 August , the Royalist trenches were dug and the artillery prepared , despite Massie 's attempts to disrupt work with musket fire . With this work done , there was no way out for the Parliamentarians ; the only hope was to delay the Royalists long enough for a relief army to arrive . To this end , Massie ordered raids under the cover of darkness , with James <unk> , his second @-@ in @-@ command , leading a raid on the artillery trenches . In revenge the Royalists attacked the east of the city , but were driven off by cannon fire . 12 August saw more raids , this time during the day , which cost the Royalists 10 men and a supply depot , with no Parliamentarian losses . Despite this , the assaults did not disrupt Royalist preparations and by the evening they were able to start bombarding the town . 
 By 24 August , the Royalists , suffering from shortfalls in their stocks of gunpowder and cannonballs , remained unable to breach the walls . Essex , in the meantime , had been urgently preparing his army , which thanks to disease , indiscipline and desertion numbered less than 6 @,@ 000 infantry and 3 @,@ 500 cavalry . This was not a force strong enough to defeat the Royalists , and so he demanded an extra 5 @,@ 000 soldiers ; Parliamentarians in London responded by enlisting the London Trained Bands , which provided an additional 6 @,@ 000 men . Taking into account additional problems and desertions , the eventual force was 9 @,@ 000 foot soldiers and 5 @,@ 000 cavalry . After being mustered on Hounslow Heath , the army began marching towards Aylesbury , arriving on 28 August . This force was formally mustered on 30 August , and after being reinforced by Lord Grey on 1 September at Brackley , marched to Gloucester . On 5 September , with heavy rain falling , the Parliamentarian army reached the town and camped on Prestbury Hill , immediately outside it ; their presence forced the Royalists to abandon the siege given that neither army , wet and exhausted , was in a state to seek battle . 
 = = = Pursuit = = = 
 Charles 's cautious failure to directly assault the town , putting a higher priority on minimising losses than on victory , had cost the Royalists dearly ; while claims for their number of dead and wounded men ranged from 1 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 500 , only around 50 people inside the city were killed . Essex 's force , on the other hand , was in relatively good shape ; its one issue was the lack of supplies . If he stayed in the Severn Valley , Essex would be unable to get reinforcements or outside aid , the London elements of the army would demand to go home , and the one remaining significant Parliamentarian force would find itself pinned down , while Charles , with secure bases at Oxford and Bristol , would be able to starve them into surrender while other Royalist armies ran rampant through Britain . Because of this , Essex had no choice but to try to return to London . Travelling back across the Cotswolds , as he had done to reach Gloucester initially , would expose the Parliamentarians to Charles 's cavalry on open ground . 
 The first alternative was to march southeast to the River Kennet and cross it , going through Newbury and returning to Reading 's fortifications , thus evading the Royalists and allowing for a safe retreat to London . The disadvantage to this was the time it would take to cross the relatively open land between Essex 's position and the Kennet . The second , and the option Essex initially took , was to go north , either to make battle in more advantageous circumstances or to evade the Royalists . If Essex was able to cross to the west bank of the River Avon , he could secure the bridges across it and prevent the Royalists from crossing it and confronting his army . His cavalry advanced to Upton to screen the main force from Royalist interference on 11 September , with the rest of the soldiers quickly following . The Royalists were left wrong @-@ footed ; Charles did not discover Essex 's retreat for another 24 hours , during which the gap between the armies widened . The Royalists finally began to march on 16 September , with Rupert 's cavalry streaming ahead to try to disrupt the Parliamentarian retreat . 
 By 18 September , Rupert 's force had caught up to the Parliamentarians outside <unk> . Essex had lost his advantage ; Parliamentarian intelligence reports had convinced him that Charles was heading towards Oxford and had given up the campaign . In fact Charles was barely 14 miles ( 23 km ) away , but the complacency such reports induced meant that one contemporary source stated the Parliamentarians were marching barely 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) a day , allowing the Royalists to quickly catch up . Suitably chastened by the discovery of his error , Essex increased the pace of his retreat , with the Royalists pursuing closely . Both sides were heading for Newbury , on roughly parallel routes ; the Royalists ' route took them through Faringdon and Wantage , increasing the distance they would have to travel to 30 miles ( 48 km ) while the Parliamentarians had to travel only 20 . Charles reacted by dispatching Rupert and 7 @,@ 000 cavalry in a flying column to disrupt and harass the Parliamentary retreat . Encountering Essex 's forces at <unk> Chase , Rupert made battle ; however , lacking enough troops to engage the Parliamentarians directly , he instead attacked a section of their army , causing chaos and crucially delaying Essex 's march just enough for Charles 's forces to close the gap . 
 The effect of Rupert 's actions , even after his forces disengaged , was to force another delay in the Parliamentarian retreat ; Essex spent much of 19 September looking after wounded soldiers and , when he finally managed to begin moving again , he was confronted with swampland and bog which further delayed him while the Royalists marched across the relatively open chalk downs above the Kennet . These hardships meant that the Royalists arrived at Newbury before Essex , with both armies settling down for the night outside the town , too exhausted to immediately fight . 
 = = Newbury = = 
 = = = Landscape = = = 
 The landscape of the area around Newbury was a significant factor in the tactics of both sides during the resulting battle . Though the land was mostly open country , a crescent @-@ shaped escarpment known as Biggs Hill sat between the Royalist and Parliamentarian forces . To either side of Essex 's army lay open fields , while the battlefield was bracketed by the River Kennet on one side and the River <unk> on the other , which neither side attempted to cross on foot . Essex 's most obvious route of advance was to push past the Royalist forces , secure the bridge and return to London . Unfortunately , the open area approaching the bridge was a " killing ground " ; soldiers would be entirely in the open and forced to march no more than six abreast , which would prevent Essex effectively deploying against a Royalist attack and leave the Parliamentarian 's forces bunched up and subject to artillery fire . Even if Essex managed to cross the bridge , the other side of the river featured several hundred metres of waterlogged ground , which would slow his soldiers and leave them open to attack while necessitating the abandonment of the Parliamentarian artillery , a " major humiliation for a seventeenth @-@ century army " . 
 The only alternative to a bridge @-@ based retreat would be to bypass Newbury completely by marching around the Royalists , but this would again involve moving through open fields and subjecting Essex 's soldiers to the attacks of Royalist cavalry , who were described as greatly outnumbering the Parliamentarian cavalry . Confronting the Royalists directly would involve moving into ground described as containing " dense copses and <unk> banked hedges with ditches flanking fields and lining sunken lanes " ; while this would allow the troops to move in a concealed fashion , it would also make deployment difficult , and the numerous lanes would restrict movement in the heat of battle . 
 = = = Order of Battle = = = 
 There are no definitive orders of battle for Newbury , as official contemporary evidence is thin ; it is possible to glean some information from both later official reports and contemporary accounts , which allow for a reconstruction of the likely disposition of each force . The Royalists were led by Charles I personally , with William Vavasour commanding the right wing , Prince Rupert the left , and Sir John Byron the centre . Artillery support consisted of 20 cannons in total : 6 heavy , 6 medium and 8 light . Initial Royalist and Parliamentarian estimates were of a force of around 17 @,@ 000 men ; modern estimates are of around 7 @,@ 500 infantry , and 7 @,@ 000 cavalry . Essex led the Parliamentarians , commanding both the entire force and , separately , the right wing ; the left wing was commanded by Philip Stapleton . Artillery support was provided by two heavy cannons and around 20 light cannons ; most of the heavy artillery was left at Gloucester to help defend the city . Estimates as to the total number of men vary between 7 @,@ 000 and 15 @,@ 000 ; John Barratt , noting the losses at Gloucester , estimates that Essex 's force totalled around 14 @,@ 000 men , with 6 @,@ 000 cavalry and dragoons and 8 @,@ 000 infantry . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = Essex attacks = = = 
 The battle began on 20 September ; Essex 's army was roused before dawn , and initial reports stated he had gone " from regiment to regiment ... [ putting ] the question of a battle unto them " . After consultation , the army advanced with " most <unk> and courageous spirits " at around 7am . Divided into " three bodies of Foot , both lined and flanked with bodies of Horse " , with a reserve behind them , the army was preceded by Stapleton 's cavalry , which quickly cleared the Royalist pickets and allowed Essex 's advance to Wash Common , a patch of open ground between the two forces . This march took approximately an hour due to the heavy clay soil being soaked from the previous night 's rain ; the open space before Biggs Hill , the objective of their march , allowed for a much welcome chance to regroup . Rupert had established a cavalry guard on Biggs Hill ; while the size is unknown , it was large enough to attack the Parliamentarian horse head @-@ on . Stapleton waited until the Royalists were close before firing , leading to the faltering of their charge and the advance of the Parliamentarian cavalry to drive them off with swords . The cavalry were unable to make further gains , having engaged only a small part of the Royalist horse and being unwilling to press their attack against the larger body . 
 By this point the Parliamentary right flank , under Philip Skippon , had begun assaulting the main Parliamentary objective – the nearby Round Hill . The official account suggests that the Parliamentarians " charged so fiercely that [ they ] beat [ the Royalists ] from the hill " ; Royalist accounts , on the other hand , argue that the hill was actually completely undefended . The official account fails to mention casualties to either attackers or defenders , or what happened to the Royalist guns which were allegedly deployed on the hill . " Both sides ' arguments have a ring of conviction but although Essex and his partisans seem to have been genuine in their belief that they had assaulted and captured a defended position , the facts suggest that the Royalist version was closer to the truth . In other words , the king and his generals had been caught napping " . Regardless of what had happened , the capture of Round Hill gave Essex the advantage , allowing Skippon to position 1 @,@ 000 musketeers on top of it to fire down into any Royalist advance . 
 = = = Royalist counter @-@ attack = = = 
 As a result of this quick advance , Charles found his army in chaos , with Skippon 's force organised and flanking them . The Royalist council of war reconvened to discuss the events , and accounts suggest the meeting was acrimonious , with the fall of Round Hill described as " a most gross and absurd error " . Rupert decided to try to contain both Essex and Skippon . Leaving two regiments of horse with Byron , he led the remainder of the cavalry to Essex 's position on the left flank . Byron , in the meantime , was commanded to support an attack by the Royalist musketeers on Skippon 's force , drawing his regiments up behind the infantry " ready to second them in case the enemy 's horse should advance towards them " . Rupert 's advance has been criticised by both Parliamentarian and Royalist sources ; instead of a small engagement , the stubbornness of the Parliamentary resistance forced Rupert to commit more and more forces to the fray , eventually turning a series of small engagements into a full @-@ scale battle , with reinforcements gradually being drawn in . The terrain limited the localised advantage Rupert 's forces had in numbers , but after three attacks Stapleton 's brigade crumbled , allowing Rupert to hook around Essex 's left flank , stop his advance and capture five pieces of artillery . This came at a cost ; the Royalists took heavy casualties , and failed to completely break Essex 's infantry . The infantry instead stubbornly retreated , allowing the Parliamentary cavalry to reorganise behind them . Even though his advance had been stopped , Essex was not yet beaten . 
 Byron 's attack on Skippon 's musketeers in the centre also went poorly . Pushing three regiments of foot forward , the force suffered similarly high casualties in an attempt to take Round Hill ; after the attack stalled , the cavalry had to be called in to force it forward . Despite heavy losses due to the only avenue of advance being a narrow lane lined with Parliamentarian musketeers , this move succeeded in allowing Byron to take Round Hill , forcing the Parliamentarian infantry back to a hedge on the far side . The attack eventually lost momentum , and although Round Hill was taken , Byron was unable to advance any further . On the right flank , William Vavasour attempted to overwhelm the Parliamentary flank with a substantial brigade of foot , which included a small amount of cavalry support . His initial attack was repulsed thanks to the Parliamentarian artillery opening fire , but a subsequent head @-@ on attack forced Skippon 's beleaguered force in the centre to send several regiments over to assist , with the fight turning into a bloody melee . Vavasour 's force was eventually forced to retire , with the Parliamentarians failing to give ground . 
 = = = Crisis and stalemate = = = 
 After heavy fighting , the Royalists had succeeded only in pushing Essex 's forces briefly back ; they had given ground but not retreated from the battle , and his main force of infantry remained strong . In an attempt to proceed , Essex waved his infantry and light artillery forward . Rupert 's cavalry was too weak to defend against this advance due to its large firepower , and he instead ordered two regiments of foot commanded by John Belasyse to halt Essex . The Parliamentarian records report they were " hotly charged by the enemies ' horse and foot " , who succeeded in forcing Essex slowly back , although the fight took four hours . In response , Essex called for Skippon to send him reinforcements ; Skippon obliged by ordering a Mainwaring 's Regiment of infantry to remove themselves from his line and march to replace some of Essex 's exhausted soldiers . As soon as they arrived , they were charged by two bodies of cavalry and a regiment of infantry under John Byron , who forced the regiment to retreat ; the Royalists hacked down the fleeing Parliamentarians and , according to Byron , his force " had not left a man of them <unk> , but that the hedges were so high the horse could not pursue them " . Although the Royalists failed to press this attack due to the difficulty of manoeuvring cavalry in the field , and Essex briefly retook the ground , the loss of this infantry regiment opened a gap in the Parliamentarian line . If Rupert was able to drive through this gap , he would break Essex 's army into two wings and be able to encircle them . Recognizing this possibility , he began redeploying the Royalist force : two regiments of cavalry and a regiment of infantry under his command would occupy Essex , while two regiments under Charles Gerard would push through the gap in the Parliamentarian line . 
 Luckily for the Parliamentarians , Skippon saw this opening and ordered two regiments of the London Trained Bands to close the gap . Although they succeeded in bridging the gap between the two wings of Essex 's force , there was no cover , and a Royalist battery of eight heavy guns drawn up on high ground began firing on them . Unable to move because of the necessity of their position , they were left enduring close @-@ range fire " when men 's bowels and brains flew in [ their ] faces " , resisting two attacks by Royalist cavalry and infantry led by Jacob Astley . Historian John Day notes that records show most Trained Band casualties were hit in the head , while a survivor boasted that the artillery " did us no harm , only the shot broke our pikes " ; evidently , in the heat of battle , the Royalist artillery were firing too high . Despite this , the Royalist artillery fire had taken its toll , and the Trained Band regiments were forced to retreat . The Royalists pursued , and only close @-@ quarters musket fire allowed the militia to regroup without substantial losses . After regrouping , the militia was again attacked by two regiments of foot and two of cavalry , who despite surrounding the Londoners and dragging away a cannon were unable to break them . 
 At this point , both armies began to draw apart ; although sporadic fighting continued as night fell , by midnight both forces had disengaged completely . Both army councils met ; Essex 's plan to force his way past the Royalists seemed feasible , and many Parliamentarians , loathe to give up the ground they had taken , fully expected the battle to continue . The Royalists , on the other hand , were plagued by poor morale , heavy losses and a lack of supplies , having used 80 of their 90 barrels of gunpowder . Although Rupert argued for the battle to continue , he was out @-@ voted , and the next morning Essex was allowed to bypass the Royalist force without issue and continue his retreat towards London . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Parliamentarian force , now free of Charles 's army , retreated towards Aldermaston as quickly as possible and eventually made it to Reading and then London , where Essex received a hero 's welcome . The Royalists , on the other hand were forced to spend the next day recovering their casualties , finding more than a thousand injured soldiers who were sent back to Oxford . After they finished recovering their dead and wounded men , the Royalists left 200 infantry , 25 cavalry and 4 guns in Donnington Castle to defend their rear and then marched to Oxford , having buried their dead senior officers in Newbury Guildhall . Casualties at Newbury eventually came to approximately 1 @,@ 300 losses for the Royalists , and 1 @,@ 200 for the Parliamentarians . The loss at Newbury was due to a multitude of factors ; Day gives credit to the greater ability of Essex to conserve his force through the campaign , which put the Royalists at a numerical disadvantage by Newbury , and notes the Royalist over @-@ reliance on Cavalry , with Essex " [ compensating ] for his much lamented paucity of cavalry by tactical ingenuity and firepower " , countering Rupert 's cavalry by driving them off with mass infantry formations . The Royalists infantry were also outperformed , Essex 's force retaining a high level of cohesiveness while the Royalists were described as relatively unprofessional ; both Day and Blair Worden also give the paucity of ammunition and gunpowder as an important ( and endemic ) deciding factor in the success or failure of Charles ' campaign . 
 Although the attention of historians is normally on the larger battles such as Edgehill and Marston Moor , several historians who have studied the period consider the First Battle of Newbury to be the defining moment of the First English Civil War , both as the high point of the Royalist advance and as the " one bright period of [ Essex 's ] generalship " . John Day writes that " Militarily and politically , Parliament 's position at the beginning of October 1643 was demonstrably far stronger than in late July . With hindsight , the capture of Bristol was the high tide of King Charles ' war , his best and only chance of ending the conflict on his own terms " . John Barratt noted that the Royalists had failed in " what might prove to have been their best chance to destroy the principle field army of their opponents , and hopes of a crushing victory which would bring down the Parliamentarian ' war party ' lay in ruins " . The high Parliamentarian feelings after Newbury led to the signing of the Solemn League and Covenant , bringing a powerful Scottish army down to assault the Royalists . " Thanks to the failure ... to win a decisive victory there , the English , Welsh , Scottish and Irish subjects of all of King Charles ' Three Kingdoms would henceforth play a bloody price in a steadily widening and deepening war " . 
 = Les pêcheurs de perles = 
 Les pêcheurs de perles ( The Pearl Fishers ) is an opera in three acts by the French composer Georges Bizet , to a libretto by Eugène Cormon and Michel Carré . It was first performed on 30 September 1863 at the Théâtre Lyrique in Paris , and was given 18 performances in its initial run . Set in ancient times on the island of Ceylon , the opera tells the story of how two men 's vow of eternal friendship is threatened by their love for the same woman , whose own dilemma is the conflict between secular love and her sacred oath as a priestess . The friendship duet " Au fond du temple saint " , generally known as " The Pearl Fishers Duet " , is one of the best @-@ known numbers in Western opera . 
 At the time of the premiere , Bizet ( born on 25 October 1838 ) was not yet 25 years old : he had yet to establish himself in the Parisian musical world . The commission to write Les pêcheurs arose from his standing as a former winner of the prestigious Prix de Rome . Despite a good reception by the public , press reactions to the work were generally hostile and dismissive , although other composers , notably Hector Berlioz , found considerable merit in the music . The opera was not revived in Bizet 's lifetime , but from 1886 onwards it was performed with some regularity in Europe and North America , and from the mid @-@ 20th century has entered the repertory of opera houses worldwide . Because the autograph score was lost , post @-@ 1886 productions were based on amended versions of the score that contained significant departures from the original . Since the 1970s , efforts have been made to reconstruct the score in accordance with Bizet 's intentions . 
 Modern critical opinion has been kinder than that of Bizet 's day . Commentators describe the quality of the music as uneven and at times unoriginal , but acknowledge the opera as a work of promise in which Bizet 's gifts for melody and evocative instrumentation are clearly evident . They have identified clear foreshadowings of the composer 's genius which would culminate , 10 years later , in Carmen . Since 1950 the work has been recorded on numerous occasions , in both the revised and original versions . 
 = = Background = = 
 Bizet 's first opera , the one @-@ act Le docteur Miracle , was written in 1856 when the 18 @-@ year @-@ old composer was a student at the Conservatoire de Paris . It was Bizet 's winning entry in a competition organised by the celebrated composer Jacques Offenbach , and gained him a cash award , a gold medal , and a performance of the prize work at the Théâtre des Bouffes @-@ Parisiens . In 1857 Bizet was awarded the prestigious Prix de Rome , and as a result spent most of the following three years in Italy , where he wrote Don Procopio , a short opera buffa in the style of Donizetti . By this time Bizet had written several non @-@ stage works , including his Symphony in C , but the poor reception accorded to his 1858 Te Deum , a religious work he composed in Rome , helped convince him that his future lay primarily with the musical theatre . He planned and possibly began several operatic works before his return to Paris in 1860 , but none of these projects came to fruition . 
 In Paris , Bizet discovered the difficulties faced by young and relatively unknown composers trying to get their operas performed . Of the capital 's two state @-@ subsidised opera houses , the Opéra and the Opéra @-@ Comique , the former offered a static repertoire in which works by foreign composers , particularly Rossini and Meyerbeer , were dominant . Even established French composers such as Gounod had difficulty getting works performed there . At the Opéra @-@ Comique , innovation was equally rare ; although more French works were performed , the style and character of most productions had hardly changed since the 1830s . However , one condition of the Opéra @-@ Comique 's state funding was that from time to time it should produce one @-@ act works by former Prix de Rome laureates . Under this provision , Bizet wrote La guzla de l <unk> , with a libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré , and this went into rehearsal early in 1862 . 
 In April 1862 , as the La guzla rehearsals proceeded , Bizet was approached by Léon Carvalho , manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company . Carvalho had been offered an annual grant of 100 @,@ 000 francs by the retiring Minister of Fine Arts , Count Walewski , on condition that each year he stage a new three @-@ act opera from a recent Prix de Rome winner . Carvalho had a high opinion of Bizet 's abilities , and offered him the libretto of Les pêcheurs de perles , an exotic story by Carré and Eugène Cormon set on the island of Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) . Sensing the opportunity for a genuine theatrical success , Bizet accepted the commission . Because Walewski restricted his grant to composers who had not had any previous work performed commercially , Bizet hurriedly withdrew La guzla from the Opéra @-@ Comique ; it has never been performed , and the music has disappeared .

 The scene is a desolate seashore , with the ruins of a Hindu temple in the background . A chorus of pearl fishermen sing of the dangerous tasks that lie ahead ( " Sur la <unk> en feu " ) , and perform ritual dances to drive away evil spirits . They then elect one of their number , Zurga , as their leader , or " king " . Nadir enters , and is hailed by Zurga as a long @-@ lost friend . Left alone , the pair reminisce about their past in the city of Kandy , where their friendship was nearly destroyed by their mutual love of a young priestess whose beauty they had glimpsed briefly . They had each renounced their love for this stranger and had sworn to remain true to each other . Now , reunited , they affirm once again that they will be faithful until death ( " Au fond du temple saint " ) . 
 A boat draws up on the beach bearing the veiled figure of Leila , the virgin priestess whose prayers are required to ensure the safety of the fishermen . Although neither of them recognises her , she is the woman from Kandy with whom Nadir and Zurga had been in love . As Zurga is explaining her duties , she recognises Nadir , but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by the high priest Nourabad . Zurga and the fishermen go down to the sea , leaving Nadir alone . In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how , in Kandy , he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman ( " Je crois entendre encore " ) . It was the rumour that she might be found in this place that brought him here . Alone in the temple , Leila prays and sings . Nadir wakes and , recognising the voice of his long @-@ desired lover , traces it to the temple . Leila briefly draws her veil aside , he sees it is she and the pair declare their renewed passion . On the beach , the fishermen plead with her to continue protecting them , but she tells Nadir she will sing for him alone ( " O Dieu Brahma " ) . 
 = = = Act 2 = = = 
 In the temple with Nourabad , Leila expresses fear at being left alone , but Nourabad exhorts her to be brave and to fulfil her vows to Brahma on pain of her own death . She tells him of the courage she once displayed when , as a child , she had hidden a fugitive from his enemies and refused to give him up even when threatened with death ( " J 'étais encore enfant " ) . The fugitive had rewarded her with a necklace that he asked her always to wear . She had kept this promise , as she would her vows . On the priest 's departure , Leila quietly muses on the former times when she and Nadir would meet together secretly ( " Comme autrefois dans la nuit sombre " ) . Nadir then enters ; in her fear of Nourabad 's threats Leila begs him to leave , but he remains and the two declare their love in a passionate duet ( " <unk> ! <unk> ! ... Dieu puissant , le <unk> ! " ) . He goes , promising to return next night , but as he leaves he is captured by the fishermen and brought back to the temple . Zurga , as the fishermen 's leader , at first resists the fishermen 's calls for Nadir 's execution and advocates mercy . However , after Nourabad removes Leila 's veil , Zurga recognises her as his former love ; consumed by jealousy and rage , he orders that both Nadir and Leila be put to death . A violent storm erupts , as the fishermen unite in singing a hymn to Brahma ( " Brahma <unk> Brahma ! " ) . 
 = = = Act 3 = = = 
 In his tent on the beach , Zurga notes that the storm has abated , as has his rage ; he now feels remorse for his anger towards Nadir ( " L <unk> est <unk> " ) . Leila is brought in ; Zurga is captivated by her beauty as he listens to her pleas for Nadir 's life , but his jealousy is rekindled . He confesses his love for her , but refuses mercy ( " Je suis jaloux " ) . Nourabad and some of the fishermen enter to report that the funeral pyre is ready . As Leila is taken away , Zurga observes her giving one of the fishermen her necklace , asking for its return to her mother . With a shout , Zurga rushes out after the group and seizes the necklace . 
 Outside the temple , Nadir waits beside the funeral pyre as the crowd , singing and dancing , anticipates the dawn and the coming double execution ( " Dès que le soleil " ) . He is joined by Leila ; resigned now to their deaths , the pair sing of how their souls will soon be united in heaven . A glow appears in the sky , and Zurga rushes in to report that the fishermen 's camp is ablaze . As the men hurry away to save their homes , Zurga frees Leila and Nadir . He returns the necklace to Leila , and reveals that he is the man she saved when she was a child . He recognises now that his love for her is in vain , and tells her and Nadir to flee . As the couple depart , singing of the life of love that awaits them , Zurga is left alone , to await the fishermen 's return ( " Plus de <unk> ... Rêves d 'amour , adieu ! " ) . 
 ( In the revised version of the ending introduced after the opera 's 1886 revival , Nourabad witnesses Zurga 's freeing of the prisoners and denounces him to the fishermen , one of whom stabs Zurga to death as the last notes sound of Leila and Nadir 's farewell song . In some variations Zurga meets his death in other ways , and his body is consigned to the pyre . ) 
 = = Writing and compositional history = = 
 The libretto was written by Eugène Cormon and Michel Carré . Cormon was a prolific author of libretti and straight drama , usually in collaboration with other writers . In his career he wrote or co @-@ wrote at least 135 works , of which Les dragons de Villars , set to music by Aimé <unk> , was perhaps the most successful . Carré , who had initially trained as a painter , had worked with Jules Barbier on Gounod 's opera Faust and had co @-@ written the play Les contes <unk> d 'Hoffmann , which became the basis of the libretto for Offenbach 's opera The Tales of Hoffmann . Before Les pêcheurs de perles Cormon and Carré had previously written a libretto for <unk> on a similar theme , Les pêcheurs de <unk> , which had been performed in 1860 ; they had originally planned to set their new story in Mexico before changing its location to Ceylon . 
 By general critical consent the libretto of Les pêcheurs de perles is a work of poor quality . The weak plot , as Bizet 's biographer Winton Dean observes , turns on the unlikely coincidence regarding Leila 's necklace , and no real effort is made in the text to bring any of the characters to life : " They are the regulation sopranos , tenors , etc . , with their faces blacked " . Mina Curtiss , in her book on Bizet , dismisses the text as banal and imitative . Donal Henahan of The New York Times , writing in 1986 , said that the libretto " rank [ ed ] right down there with the most appallingly inept of its kind " . The writers themselves admitted its shortcomings : Cormon commented later that had they been aware of Bizet 's quality as a composer , they would have tried harder . Carré was worried about the weak ending , and constantly sought suggestions for changing it ; Curtiss records that in exasperation , the theatre manager Carvalho suggested that Carré burn the libretto . This facetious remark , Curtiss asserts , led Carré to end the opera with the fishermen 's tents ablaze as Leila and Nadir make their escape . 
 Because he did not receive Carvalho 's commission until April 1863 , with the projected opening night set for mid @-@ September , Bizet composed quickly with , Curtiss says , " a tenacity and concentration quite foreign to him in his Roman days " . He had some music available on which he could draw ; through the previous winter he had worked on the score of an opera , Ivan IV with the promise , which fell through , that the work would be staged in Baden @-@ Baden . Ivan IV provided music for three numbers in Les pêcheurs de perles : the prelude ; part of Zurga 's " Une fille <unk> " ; and the third act duet " O lumière sainte " . The " Brahma <unk> Brahma " chorus was adapted from the rejected Te Deum , and the chorus " Ah chante , chante encore " from Don Procopio . It is also likely that music composed for the cancelled La guzla de l <unk> found its way into the new opera 's score , which was completed by early August . The libretto was changed frequently during the creation process , even when the work had reached the rehearsal stage ; the chorus " L 'ombre descend " was added at Bizet 's request , and other numbers were shortened or removed .

 = = = Premiere and initial run = = = 
 The premiere , originally planned for 14 September 1863 , was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead , <unk> de <unk> . The first @-@ night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well , and called for Bizet at the conclusion . The writer Louis Gallet , who later would provide several librettos for Bizet , described the composer on this occasion as " a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round , still rather childish face , enlivened by the quick brown eyes ... " The audience 's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews , which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet 's lack of modesty in appearing on stage . Gustave Bertrand in Le <unk> wrote that " this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success , and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself , or at least pretending to be " . Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a " claque " of Bizet 's friends , strategically distributed . 
 Of the opera itself , Benjamin <unk> of Le Figaro wrote : " There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music " . He considered that on every page the score displayed " the bias of the school to which [ Bizet ] belongs , that of Richard Wagner " . Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David . " Nevertheless " , he wrote , " there is a talent floating in the midst of all these regrettable imitations " . Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility ; his review of the work in Journal des <unk> praised the music 's originality and subtlety : " The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour " , he wrote . Among Bizet 's contemporaries , the dramatist Ludovic Halévy wrote that this early work announced Bizet as a composer of quality : " I persist in finding in [ the score ] the rarest virtues " . The youthful composer Émile <unk> told his father that the opera was superior to anything that the established French opera composers of the day , such as Auber and Thomas , were capable of producing . 
 In its initial run Les pêcheurs de perles ran for 18 performances , alternating with Mozart 's The Marriage of Figaro . It closed on 23 November 1863 , and although it brought the theatre little financial success , Bizet had won admiration from his peers . Carvalho was satisfied enough to ask Bizet to quickly finish Ivan IV , with a view to its early production at the Théâtre Lyrique . This idea eventually came to nothing ; Ivan IV remained unperformed until 1946 . 
 = = = Early revivals = = = 
 After its opening run , Les pêcheurs was not performed again until 11 years after Bizet 's death when , on 20 March 1886 , it was presented in Italian at La Scala , Milan . After this it received regular stagings in European cities , often with the Italian version of the libretto . These revivals , which possibly reflected the growing success of Carmen , were followed by the publication of several versions of the music that incorporated significant differences from Bizet 's original . In particular the finale was altered , to provide a more dramatic ending — " a grand <unk> holocaust " according to Dean . This revised conclusion included a trio composed by Benjamin Godard . These corrupted scores remained the basis of productions for nearly a century . 
 The opera received its British premiere on 22 April 1887 , at London 's Covent Garden , under the title Leila . The part of Nadir was sung by Paul Lhérie , the original Don José in the 1875 Carmen . Press reactions were muted ; The Times 's music critic found much of the music incompatible with the exotic setting — the hymn to Brahma was , he suggested , reminiscent of a Lutheran chorale . The Observer 's reporter found " no trace of genuine inspiration " , and drew unfavourable comparisons with Carmen . When Covent Garden repeated the production in May 1889 the Princess of Wales and other members of the British royal family were present . The Manchester Guardian 's correspondent praised the singers but found that the work " becomes weaker and weaker as it goes on " . 
 Les pêcheurs returned to Paris on 20 April 1889 , when it was performed — in Italian — at the Théâtre de la Gaîté . Despite a distinguished cast — Emma Calvé , Jean @-@ Alexandre <unk> and Lhérie , now a baritone , in the role of Zurga — critical reviews were no more enthusiastic than those which had greeted the original performances . Le <unk> excused Bizet on account of his youth , while The Manchester Guardian 's report summed up the Parisian view of the work as " almost entirely lacking in ... boldness & originality " . On 24 April 1893 Carvalho revived the work , in French , at the Opéra @-@ Comique , its first performance at what would later become its regular home . 
 Productions continued to proliferate in Europe , and further afield ; on 25 August 1893 the opera received its American premiere in Philadelphia . Two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years later , on 11 January 1896 , the first two acts were performed at the New York Metropolitan Opera ( the " Met " ) , as part of a programme that included Jules Massenet 's one @-@ act opera La Navarraise . The cast was led by Calvé and the Italian baritone Mario Ancona . 
 The Met 's first complete staging of the opera came 20 years later , on 13 November 1916 , when a star cast that included Enrico Caruso , Frieda Hempel and Giuseppe De Luca gave three performances . According to W. H. Chase in the Evening Sun , the act 1 duet " brought down the house in a superb blending of the two men 's voices " ; later , in " Je crois entendre encore " , Caruso " did some of the most artistic singing in plaintive minor " . In The Sun , W. J. Henderson , praised Hempel for her " ravishing upper tones " , Da Luca was " a master of the delicate finish " , and the bass Léon <unk> , in the small part of Nourabad , " filled Bizet 's requirements perfectly " . 
 = = = Entering the mainstream = = = 
 In the years after the First World War the work lost popularity with opera @-@ house directors , and it was seen less frequently . The Met did not repeat its 1916 production , though individual numbers from the work — most frequently the famous duet and Leila 's " Comme autrefois " — were regularly sung at the Met 's concert evenings . The 1930s saw a return of interest in the opera , with productions in new venues including Nuremberg and the Berlin State Opera . Some revivals were unconventional : one German production used a rewritten libretto based on a revised storyline in which Leila , transformed into a defiant Carmen @-@ like heroine , commits suicide at the end of the final scene . Paris 's Opéra @-@ Comique staged a more traditional production in 1932 , and again in 1938 , Bizet 's centenary year . From that time onward it has remained in the Opéra @-@ Comique repertory . 
 After the Second World War , although the opera was shunned by Covent Garden , the Sadler 's Wells company presented it in March 1954 . The Times announced this production as the first known use in Britain of the opera 's English libretto . The stage designs for this production , which was directed by Basil Coleman , were by John Piper . 
 In the early 1970s , Arthur Hammond orchestrated the sections of the neglected 1863 vocal score that had been cut out from the post @-@ 1886 scores . This led to a production in 1973 , by Welsh National Opera , of a version close to Bizet 's original , without Godard 's trio and Zurga 's violent death — the first modern performance to incorporate the original ending . 
 The Sadler 's Wells production was revived several times , but it was not until September 1987 that the company , by then transformed into English National Opera , replaced it with a new staging directed by Philip Prowse . The Guardian 's report on this production mentioned that the " Pearl Fishers Duet " had recently topped the list in a poll of the public 's " best tunes " , and described the opera as " one of the most sweetly tuneful in the French repertory " . This production " ... [ brought ] out its freshness , never letting it become sugary " . Although the run was a sell @-@ out , ENO 's managing director Peter Jonas disliked the production , and refused to revive it . It did not reappear in ENO 's repertory until 1994 , after Jonas 's departure .

 In the latter years of the 20th century the opera was a regular feature in many European cities , and was still breaking new ground ; in 1990 it made its debut at the Slovak National Theatre in Bratislava . Vienna saw it for the first time in 1994 , at the Vienna Volksoper , in what John Rockwell in the New York Times described as " an awkwardly updated production " , though well performed . The opera had not so far proved particularly popular in the United States , where since the Met premiere of 1916 , performances had been rare compared with Europe . Lyric Opera of Chicago staged it in 1966 , but waited until 1998 before reviving it . In 1980 the New York City Opera mounted a production based on the 1863 edition , and staged it again in 1983 and 1986 . Reviewing the 1986 production , Henahan wrote that despite the inept libretto the work was saved by the " melodic suppleness and warmth " of Bizet 's score . 
 San Diego Opera first staged the work in 1993 , but it was this company 's 2004 production , designed by Zandra Rhodes , that generated new levels of enthusiasm for the opera throughout the United States . In the following few years this production was shown in seven other U.S. opera houses ; in October 2008 James C. Whitson , in Opera News , reported that worldwide , " between 2007 and 2009 , half of all major production of the piece have been or will be ... in the U.S. " . San Diego 's director , Ian Campbell , suggested that his company 's 2004 production was " created at a time when it seemed many U.S. opera companies were looking for a not @-@ too @-@ expensive production with melody , and a little off the beaten track .... [ Our ] Les pêcheurs de perles fitted the bill . 
 In January 2008 the opera received its first performance in Sri Lanka , the land of its setting . The conductor , Benjamin Levy , directed a large group of singers and musicians , mostly young and local . In October 2010 , after an interval of more than 120 years , the opera was reintroduced to London 's Royal Opera House . Two concert performances were given using a new edition of the score , prepared by Brad Cohen after the discovery in the Bibliothèque nationale de France of Bizet 's 1863 conducting score . Commenting on this performance in The Daily Telegraph , Rupert Christiansen drew attention to the " musing intimacy and quiet dignity " with which the duet was sung , as compared with more traditional macho renderings . 
 = = Music = = 
 The opera begins with a brief orchestral prelude , the principal theme of which prefigures Leila 's entrance . The opening chorus is punctuated by a lively dance — the critic John W. Klein describes it as " electrifying " . Nadir 's first significant contribution is his aria " Des <unk> et des <unk> " , sung to an accompaniment of cellos and bassoons under a string tremolo that indicates the possible influence of Meyerbeer . Flutes and harps are used to introduce the main theme of the celebrated " Pearl Fishers Duet " , in what the opera historian Hervé Lacombe identifies as " the most highly developed poetic scene in the opera " . The duet 's theme has become the opera 's principal musical signature , repeated in the work whenever the issue of the men 's friendship arises — though in Dean 's view the tune is not worthy of the weight it carries . Dean suggests that Bizet 's ability to find the appropriate musical phrase with style and economy is better demonstrated in his treatment of Leila 's oath of chastity , where a simple phrase is repeated twice in minor third steps . Nadir 's aria " Je crois entendre encore " , towards the end of act 1 , is written on a <unk> rhythm , with a dominant cor anglais whereby , says Lacombe , " [ t ] he listener has the impression that the horn is singing " . 
 In act 2 a short orchestral introduction is followed by an off @-@ stage chorus , notable for its sparse accompaniment — a tambourine and two piccolos . After Nourabad reminds Leila of her oath and leaves her alone she sings her cavatina " Comme autrefois " . Two French horns introduce the theme , supported by the cellos . When her voice enters , says Lacombe , " it replaces the first horn whose characteristic sound it seems to continue " . Dean likens this song to Micaela 's aria " Je dis que rien ne m <unk> " from Carmen . Nadir 's " De mon amie " which follows the cavatina has , says Dean , " a haunting beauty " ; its introductory phrase recalls the oboe theme in Bizet 's youthful Symphony in C. Dean cites the second act finale , with its repeated climaxes as the crowds demand the errant couple 's deaths , as an example of Bizet 's developing skills in writing theatrical music . The third act , divided into two brief scenes , begins with Zurga 's entrance to quiet chromatic scales played over a tonic pedal , an effect that Bizet would later use in his incidental music to L 'Arlésienne . The duet " Je <unk> " , says Dean , has clear hints of Verdi 's Il trovatore , and the fiery chorus " Dès que le soleil " is reminiscent of a Mendelssohn scherzo , but otherwise the final act 's music is weak and lacking in dramatic force . In the closing scene , in which Zurga bids a last farewell to his dreams of love , the friendship theme from the act 1 duet sounds for the final time . 
 According to Lacombe , Les pêcheurs de perles is characteristic of French opéra lyrique , in particular through Bizet 's use of arioso and dramatic recitative , his creation of atmospheres , and his evocation of the exotic . Berlioz described the opera 's score as beautiful , expressive , richly coloured and full of fire , but Bizet himself did not regard the work highly , and thought that , a few numbers apart , it deserved oblivion . Parisian critics of the day , attuned to the gentler sounds of Auber and Offenbach , complained about the heaviness of Bizet 's orchestration , which they said was noisy , overloaded and Wagnerian — " a fortissimo in three acts " . The conductor Hans von Bülow dismissed the work contemptuously as " a tragical operetta " , and when it was revived after 1886 , resented having to conduct it . Modern writers have generally treated the piece more generously ; the music may be of uneven quality and over @-@ reflective of the works of Bizet 's contemporaries , says Dean , but there are interesting hints of his mature accomplishments . Others have given credit to the composer for overcoming the limitations of the libretto with some genuinely dramatic strokes and the occasional inspiring melody .

 The listing is based on the 1977 EMI recording , which used the 1863 vocal score . In the post @-@ 1886 revisions the act 1 " <unk> sainte " duet was replaced with a reprise of " Au fond du temple saint " . In act 3 the sequence of numbers after the chorus " Dès que le soleil " was changed after 1886 , together with cuts from and additions to the original . " O lumière sainte " , was recomposed by Benjamin Godard as a trio for Nadir , Leila and Zurga . 
 = Roksan Xerxes = 
 The Roksan Xerxes transcription turntable ( often shortened to Xerxes ) is a record player named after the Persian king Xerxes I and produced by London @-@ based Roksan Audio . Designed by Roksan co @-@ founder , Touraj Moghaddam , the Xerxes is a belt @-@ driven turntable that has a solid plinth . Launched in 1985 , the sound quality of the product positioned it as a strong competitor against the established industry leader , the Linn Sondek LP12 . Many reviewers use the Xerxes as a reference turntable . 
 The production version of the Xerxes is called " Xerxes.20plus " , a reference to the 20th anniversary of the launch , in 2005 . 
 = = History = = 
 Before Touraj Moghaddam founded Roksan , he had become dissatisfied with the state of the audio arts when he heard his little television set reproduce Thelonious Monk in a more musically satisfying way than his high @-@ end Linn / Naim tri @-@ amped audio system . Through experimentation , he deduced that the existing turntable design failed because the cartridge was not being held still wherever the groove went . He believed that the mean line traced by the groove relative to the body of the cartridge needed to be constant . His ideas led him away from using the sprung sub @-@ chassis as part of the speed @-@ controlling system . Needing a top plinth roughly an inch ( 25 mm ) thick made from wood with a density of about 700 to 800 kg / m3 , Moghaddam found suitable material in a fire door with which he built a prototype . His friend Tufan Hashemi – then an investment analyst – heard the new prototype turntable and wanted one . They agreed to team up to start production ; Roksan Audio was formed . The Xerxes , introduced in 1985 , secured the advocacy of Roger Macer , a successful independent hi @-@ fi retailer in London who sold the then market leader , the Linn Sondek . Hashemi credits Macer with urging him to start satisfying the demand of " dozens or more a week " from his customers . The product , named after the Persian king Xerxes I , was launched at a hi @-@ fi show in 1985 where the Roksan Darius loudspeaker concept was also unveiled . 
 = = = Design principles = = = 
 Tufan Hashemi said Roksan sought to create equipment that would excel in high @-@ quality musical reproduction and capable of involving the listener on an emotional level . Product characteristics were to include precision and transparency of the sound . Moghaddam , acting as chief designer , set out to find solutions to engineering problems he saw as inherent in the belt @-@ driven suspended sub @-@ chassis turntable design of Edgar <unk> , where the sub @-@ chassis and tonearm are free to rotate . Moghaddam believed that the design generated undesirable torsional modes . One such torsional mode is said to be caused by " groove drag " – dynamic forces exerted by the stylus on the record as it tracked it . Moghaddam chose to attenuate the torsion by mounting the turntable @-@ drive motor casing on its own bearing . The motor , mounted separately and tethered to a spring , is allowed limited rotation about its own axis ; because the load varied with groove modulations , the increases in drag would thus be dampened by the spring @-@ loaded motor , and the platter acceleration mitigated . In the words of Tufan Hashemi , Roksan Audio 's managing director : 
 " We argued that using a suspended or floating surface to support a record could not allow it to be accurately read , as the record itself would be floating . We said that the record surface should remain stationary and solid but in complete isolation from the rest of the deck , and our design provided a very stable base for isolating a record without suspending it . " 
 Like the LP12 , the Xerxes has a two @-@ piece platter – sub @-@ platter configuration on which sits a thin felt mat . And while the LP12 's platters are made of <unk> , the Xerxes ' platters are of aluminium . The outer platter is rigid and peripherally weighted . However , the Roksan 's outer platter weighs less than half of that of the LP12 , to reduce load on the main bearing , yet is able to achieve a greater inertia because of its weight distribution . 
 A second challenge was how to overcome the rotation of the suspended parts – the sub @-@ chassis , platter , arm and cartridge – relative to the motor . This was done by re @-@ imagining a suspension that had less freedom of lateral movement relative to the drive motor . The Xerxes uses a relatively light medium @-@ density fibreboard ( MDF ) top board on which the bearing and tonearm assemblies are mounted . Firm rubber " Blobs " mounted on the bottom board ( along with the motor assembly ) support yet decouple from the top board . Aesthetically , the two boards are encased by a wooden surround fixed to the base board with screws . These design principles can be seen throughout the evolution of the Xerxes , right through to the Xerxes <unk> . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The original Xerxes design is deliberately a radical departure from the traditional suspended sub @-@ chassis design . Instead of having a three @-@ point sprung suspension separating the plinth from the sub @-@ chassis , the Xerxes is made up of two boards separated from each other by stiff rubber " Blobs " . The top plinth sees mountings for the main bearing and tonearm . A hole is cut out from the top board for the motor assembly to emerge from its fixture on the board below . On the lower board , to which an outer surround is attached , three compliant rubber feet give additional isolation to the turntable 's chosen placement . One notable characteristic of the deck is the large C @-@ shaped groove cut into the top plinth to control how vibrations would be transmitted from platter to the tonearm area . However , the cut @-@ out is prone to a commonly observed " plinth sag " , where the part of it would bend out of true with the rest of the board . 
 While some other designs use clamps to couple the disc to the platter , Roksan shares the same philosophy as Linn in believing that rigid coupling would cause rumble to be transmitted from the main bearing , thus colouring the sound . To further increase isolation , the Xerxes possesses a spindle that allows the user to centre the record , but which is supposed to be removed during listening so that the disc rests solely on the felt mat . 
 The bearing @-@ mounted spring @-@ loaded motor is powered by an outboard power supply designated the <unk> . Its basic power supply switchable between 33 and 45 rpm . Throughout the years , there have been many changes which have significantly improved this table . The earliest and most important of these was a new main bearing ( c . 1989 ) . Other changes include modifications to components such as the outboard power supply , now in its seventh version , and the suspension blobs . 
 = = Partnering = = 
 = = = <unk> and cartridges = = = 
 Early versions were a platform for mounting third party tonearms . Prior to the launch of Roksan 's maiden tonearm – the Artemiz , it was most commonly partnered with the Rega RB300 ( at the " budget " end ) , and the SME V ( at the " top " end ) . Other 12 @-@ inch arms , like <unk> or SME 309 , were also chosen by buyers . The Rega was able to function in a way that seemed more synergistic with the Xerxes than the LP12 . In both price and performance terms , the original Xerxes , fitted with the Rega RB300 costing £ 95 , became a head @-@ on ( and cheaper ) alternative to the LP12 fitted with the Linn <unk> arm . 
 By 2010 , Roksan has three tonearms to partner their deck : the Artemiz , the Tabriz ( and its ' Zi ' version ) and the <unk> Nima . 
 = = = = Roksan Artemiz = = = = 
 Launched in 1987 priced at £ 350 , Artemiz is the flagship tonearm whose design was also a break from established conventions . The arm and <unk> is a one @-@ piece construction ; the large @-@ gauge aluminium tube interference @-@ fitted at one end into a massive yoke that is the bearing . The tube is flat at the other end to provide for mounting the cartridge . The arm is finished in a matt resonant paint . Unusually , there is no finger lift for cueing but the arm is fitted with a conventional lever @-@ operated lift / lower assembly . 
 The bearing housings are at either side and the vertical bearings are above and below the arm tube are massive , and machined from a single solid piece . The bearings have a pyramidal arrangement : the upper component , consisting of three ball @-@ bearings arranged in a triangle , rests on a single ball @-@ bearing below . The bearings have deliberate play in them which allows movement in response to the dynamic forces when records are tracked . 
 The Artemiz also possesses an " intelligent counterweight " . Its fulcrum is balanced on a stub at the rear of the arm so that its weight is decoupled from the arm and its centre of gravity low .

 It was launched in 1985 into already established competition where Linn Sondek LP12 dominated . Other competitors included the Well Tempered Table , the <unk> P3 , the Michell <unk> , Pink Triangle , the Dunlop <unk> , and the Logic DM @-@ 101 . At its launch , the Xerxes was priced at around UK £ 300 – approximately £ 100 cheaper than an LP12 . 
 The company was highly influential in the way hi @-@ fi was sold , and it managed to wrest market share from Linn and Naim , who had a stranglehold in the UK . Hi @-@ fi critic Art Dudley observed that prior to Roksan arriving on the scene , 
 people who valued a component 's rhythmic and melodic capabilities had only one real turntable choice , the ( still splendid ) Linn LP12 . But the first Roksan Xerxes was so good , and so superior to the pre @-@ Lingo LP12 , that honest listeners among the so @-@ called / self @-@ called ' Flat @-@ <unk> ' had no choice but to say so . 
 The Xerxes is known for its speed stability and its ability to extract information and detail from the record groove . It thus became acceptable to acknowledge good performance from products by companies other than Linn , Naim , and Rega . What Hi @-@ Fi ? considered the Xerxes " arguably the first turntable to give the previously all conquering Linn Sondek LP12 a real run for its money " . 
 Throughout the Inspector Morse TV series , the lead character , when seen at home , is often listening to music on his Xerxes . According to the manufacturers , the producers of the show deliberately sought to feature one in the series , from the first episode , to highlight Morse 's passion for music . In the first episode , The Dead of Jericho , the people associated with the fictional manufacturer of the turntable ( Richards Audio Research ) were the focal point of the storyline .

 The Xerxes exists in four distinct versions . The original two @-@ plinth Xerxes ( 1985 ) was discontinued after about eight years ' production , after the Touraj Moghaddam Signature ( TMS ) was launched . On the 10th anniversary of the company ( 1995 ) , Roksan reprised the entry @-@ level Xerxes turntable with a 3 @-@ plinth design named <unk> Its top plinth houses the tonearm and the main bearing , and is isolated from the base by five Blobs , which also allow the plinth to be adjusted in two planes – parallel and perpendicular to the motor and main bearing . The motor is driven by <unk> V Reference motor drive , which receives power from <unk> Reference Power Supply . 
 The <unk> which superseded the <unk> in 2005 incorporated new main bearing ball and the new <unk> @-@ 5 sub @-@ plinth .

 According to the manufacturer , the Xerxes.20plus incorporates key design elements from the <unk> , including the tungsten carbide bearing ball , inner and outer aluminium platter , mat and <unk> blobs . The isolation between the plinth layers of the 20 has been improved for the Plus . The bearing is of a higher quality ; the platter and sub @-@ platter have been redesigned .

 Brian Urlacher ( / <unk> / ; born May 25 , 1978 ) is a former American football linebacker who spent his entire 13 @-@ year career playing for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League ( NFL ) . He played college football for the University of New Mexico , where he was recognized as a consensus All @-@ American and became one of the school 's most decorated athletes . 
 The Bears selected Urlacher with the ninth overall pick in the 2000 NFL Draft . Urlacher quickly established himself as one of the NFL 's most productive defensive players . After winning the NFL Rookie of the Year Award in 2000 , he was elected to eight Pro Bowls , and won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award in 2005 . His playing style , accomplishments and reputation have made him one of the team 's most popular players . After retiring from playing football , he was briefly an analyst for Fox Sports 1 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Urlacher was born to Bradley and Lavoyda Urlacher in Pasco , Washington , and his parents raised him with his younger brother Casey . After his parents separated , Lavoyda raised Urlacher and his siblings in Lovington , New Mexico . He spent his youth immersed in sports , and developed an interest in football , basketball , track and later table tennis ; he graduated from Lovington High School in 1996 . While his mother worked several jobs to keep her family afloat , Urlacher spent his teenage years playing sports for Lovington High School and training in weight rooms . The training helped Urlacher gain the speed , stamina , and strength he would need to solidify his football career . 
 As he progressed through high school , Urlacher gained experience in all three phases of football . He saw playing time as a running back , wide receiver , return specialist , and defensive back . Urlacher led the Lovington High Wildcats to an undefeated 14 – 0 season , and a division 3 @-@ A state championship . He finished the season with twelve touchdown receptions , six touchdown returns , and two rushing touchdowns . He additionally merited state @-@ recognized honors in football , as well as basketball . Lovington has since recognized Urlacher 's accomplishments by retiring his high @-@ school jersey number , and naming a holiday after him . 
 Urlacher wanted to attend Texas Tech University , but the school did not offer him an athletic scholarship . 
 = = College career = = 
 Urlacher enrolled at the University of New Mexico , majored in criminology , and played for the New Mexico Lobos football team . The Lobos ' head coach , Dennis Franchione , converted Urlacher to linebacker , but often left him on the sidelines in favor of more experienced players . The team finished with winning records during Urlacher 's first two years and even made a trip to the 1997 Insight.com Bowl . The team 's success prompted Franchione to leave New Mexico in favor of Texas Christian University . His departure prompted the school to hire Rocky Long , a former coach at UCLA . 
 Urlacher flourished under Long 's tenure . Urlacher not only received more playing time , but also played a more versatile role on both offense and defense . Long converted Urlacher into a " Lobo @-@ Back " , a cross between a linebacker and free safety , and placed him in a 3 @-@ 3 @-@ 5 defense scheme . He spent significant time training with the team 's defensive coordinator , Bronco Mendenhall , who helped Urlacher refine his skills as a defensive back . Long also used Urlacher as a return specialist and wide receiver throughout his final two years with the Lobos . Despite Long 's extensive changes to the team 's roster , formations , and work ethic , the Lobos ' performance declined . However , Urlacher became one of the team 's most productive players during this time . He finished his career with 442 tackles , three interceptions , 11 sacks and 11 forced fumbles . Outside of defense , he caught six touchdown passes , and returned five kicks for touchdowns . 
 After the 1999 season , he was one of the finalists for the Jim Thorpe Award , and finished twelfth on the Heisman Trophy ballot . Urlacher received All @-@ American honors from Walter Camp , Football Writers Association of America , and the Associated Press . He played his final collegiate game at the 2000 Senior Bowl , where he was one of the game 's top players . Urlacher led the nation with 178 tackles during his junior year , and also set a school record for most tackles in a single season . He finished with the third most career tackles in the University of New Mexico 's history . The school has honored Urlacher on several occasions . They awarded him with the Male Athlete of the Year Award in 2000 , and held a special halftime ceremony to honor his success in 2006 . Urlacher was also the first person to be inducted into the University of New Mexico 's Football Wall of Fame .

 Urlacher was considered one of the most talented collegiate prospects in the 2000 NFL Draft , and impressed spectators and analysts at the NFL Scouting Combine by bench pressing 225 pounds twenty @-@ seven times , and completing the forty @-@ yard dash in 4 @.@ 57 seconds . The Chicago Bears , who were in need of a defensive playmaker after having the 29th ranked defense in 1999 , selected Urlacher in the first round , as the draft 's ninth overall pick . 
 = = = 2000 – 2004 = = = 
 He signed a five @-@ year contract , which was worth nearly eight million dollars with a five and a half million dollar signing bonus , within two months of the draft . Dick Jauron , who was then the Bears ' head coach , recognized Urlacher 's versatility as a middle and outside linebacker , and appointed him as the team 's starting strongside linebacker . However , Urlacher struggled to perform consistently in his first professional game , and lost his starting position to <unk> Colvin . Jauron left Urlacher on the sidelines during the following week , as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers shut out the Bears , 41 – 0 . 
 He managed to regain a starting spot on the Bears ' roster , after Barry Minter , the team 's veteran middle linebacker , was forced to miss the Week 3 game on account of an injury . Urlacher excelled at the middle linebacker position , and recorded 46 tackles , six sacks , and one interception in his next five starts . Not even a rib cage injury hindered his performance during this period , as Urlacher went on to win the league 's Rookie Defensive Player of the Month in October . He led the Bears with 124 tackles and eight sacks , both of which surpassed the franchise 's previous rookie records . Although the Bears finished with a disappointing 5 – 11 record , Urlacher received a number of individual accolades for his performance during the season . Many news organizations , such as the Associated Press and The Sporting News named him as the 2000 Defensive Rookie of the Year . Football fans across the nation also voted Urlacher to play at the 2001 Pro Bowl as an alternate middle linebacker . Urlacher 's successful rookie campaign served as the foundation for his professional career and reputation . 
 Urlacher further distinguished himself as one of the Bears ' most productive playmakers during the 2001 season . He had one of the best games of his career on October 7 , against the Atlanta Falcons . Urlacher held Falcons quarterback Michael Vick , who was well known for his scrambling abilities , to 18 rushing yards , and recorded a forced fumble and sack . He also returned one of Vick 's fumbles for a 90 @-@ yard touchdown . Two weeks later , Urlacher helped set up a Bears comeback victory against the San Francisco 49ers by intercepting a pass , and later setting up a game winning touchdown return for Mike Brown , after causing 49ers wide receiver Terrell Owens to lose control of a pass . He also caught a touchdown pass from punter Brad Maynard off a fake field goal attempt against the Washington Redskins in Week 14 , which clinched a first @-@ round bye . Urlacher concluded the season with three interceptions , six sacks , and was a candidate for 2001 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award . Football Digest named Urlacher their publication 's defensive player of the year . The 2001 Chicago Bears won 13 games , marking the team 's best finish since 1986 , but lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Divisional Playoffs . 
 Unfortunately , the Bears ’ 2001 winning season would be followed by three years of mediocrity . Before the 2004 NFL season , the Bears ’ organization fired coach Dick Jauron and then hired Lovie Smith . After starting the season on the lower rungs of the NFC North , Urlacher suffered several injuries that sidelined him for a majority of the season . 
 = = = 2005 – 2011 = = = 
 In 2005 , Urlacher won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year after playing for a defensive team that allowed the fewest points per game , and created the most turnovers in the National Football Conference . Urlacher himself recorded at least 10 tackles in six consecutive games , while finishing the season with a team high 121 tackles . He was also credited as one of the team 's leaders , whose audibles and experience helped develop several younger teammates . Urlacher led the Bears to an 11 @-@ 5 record , marking their best finish since 2001 . Urlacher played his second career playoff game against the Carolina Panthers on January 15 , 2006 . He recorded seven tackles and one interception in a 29 – 21 loss . Urlacher was also selected to the 2006 Pro Bowl , but declined the position on account of an injury . 
 The team continued their resurgence into the 2006 season , finishing with a record of 13 – 3 . During the season , Urlacher had one of the best performances of his professional career against the Arizona Cardinals . He helped the Bears overcome a 20 @-@ point deficit by recording 19 tackles and a forced fumble that was returned for a touchdown . Teammate Devin Hester commented on Urlacher 's performance , stating , " We watched the film and everybody was saying that he just turned into the Incredible Hulk the last four minutes of the game , just killing people and running over and tackling whoever had the ball . " The Bears won the NFC Championship against the New Orleans Saints , 39 – 14 , but lost Super Bowl XLI to the Indianapolis Colts , 29 – 17 . Urlacher finished the season with 93 tackles and three forced fumbles . He was elected to the 2006 All @-@ Pro Team and 2007 Pro Bowl , while also earning consideration for the League 's Defensive Player of the Year award . 
 The Bears were unable to replicate their success in the 2007 season , and finished last in the NFC North . In the middle of the season , Urlacher admitted that he had been suffering from an arthritic back , but later claimed the ailment was not serious . Nevertheless , he finished the season on a high note , registering five interceptions , five sacks , one fumble recovery , 123 tackles , and a defensive touchdown . Following the season 's conclusion , Urlacher received minor neck surgery to treat his arthritic back . During the off season , Urlacher revised his contract with the Bears , who granted him a $ 6 million signing bonus with a $ 1 million increase in salary each of the next four years . 
 Urlacher dislocated his wrist in the 2009 season opener against the Packers . He underwent surgery , and went on to miss the remainder of the season . Urlacher had severely damaged a bone in his wrist that was adjacent to a major nerve . Urlacher was forced to wear a cast on his wrist for 12 weeks and spend a month in therapy to recover from the injury . The Bears began to struggle on offense and defense . As frustration built , Urlacher criticized the Bears offense , stating that the addition of quarterback Jay Cutler had changed the team 's identity . The Bears , who have historically employed a strong running game , were beginning to rely more on the pass on offense . He went on to say , " Kyle Orton might not be the flashiest quarterback , but the guy is a winner , and that formula worked for us . I hate to say it , but that 's the truth . " Urlacher and Cutler later made amends . The Bears finished the season with a 7 – 9 record , and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year . 
 After recovering from the injury , Urlacher stated , " I feel more powerful . I ’ m running to the football , my keys are a lot more clear now , and I ’ m playing downhill ... So I think it did help my body kind of calm down and relax a little bit . " During the 2010 offseason , Bears general manager Jerry Angelo bolstered the team 's defense by signing free agent Julius Peppers . 
 With Peppers ' help , Urlacher and the Bears improved to an 11 – 5 record in the 2010 NFL season , winning the NFC North and earning a first @-@ round bye for the 2011 Playoffs . After leading the NFC in tackles ( 49 ) during the period , Urlacher was recognized as the NFC Defensive Player of the Month during December / January . It was the first time winning the award in his career . Urlacher was also voted to his seventh Pro Bowl for his stellar defensive efforts during the year . 
 In 2011 in Week 17 against the Minnesota Vikings , Urlacher sprained his MCL when teammate Major Wright and Vikings receiver Percy Harvin landed on him with 5 : 15 left in the game . Luckily for him , there was no ACL damage , according to his MRI . Urlacher was eventually named to the Pro Bowl , but didn 't play due to the injury against Minnesota . Though he participated in the team 's first four training camp practices , he hadn 't participated in any other practices since July 31 . On August 14 , 2012 , Urlacher had an arthroscopic debridement procedure on his left knee , and has stated that his goal is to play in the 2012 season opener . He eventually practiced on September 3 , and played against the Colts in the season opener , though he sat out the second half .

 The 2012 – 13 NHL lockout ensured that Schroeder started the 2012 @-@ 13 season with the Wolves . Schroeder played in 30 games with the Wolves , scoring nine goals and ten assists . When the lockout ended in January 2013 he was initially sent back to Chicago , but after the Canucks played two games he was recalled to join the team . He made his NHL debut January 23 , 2013 against the Calgary Flames . Schroeder recorded his first point , an assist , on January 25 against the Anaheim Ducks , his second NHL game . He then scored the winning shootout goal in his sixth game , the Canucks 2 @-@ 1 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on February 1 . In his ninth game , February 9 against Calgary , Schroeder scored his first two goals in the NHL ; both came against Leland Irving , with the first one being the game winning goal . 
 Schroeder spent the summer prior to the 2013 – 14 season recovering from shoulder surgery . He then fractured his left ankle in the Canucks first preseason game of the year . By mid @-@ October Schroeder returned to the Canucks ; however he only played three games before once again fracturing his left ankle ; surgery was required after this injury , keeping him out until January 2014 . Prior to rejoining the Canucks , Schroeder played two games with their AHL affiliate , the Utica Comets , recording one assist . He would ultimately play 25 games with Vancouver during the season , recording six points . As a result , the Canucks did not tender Schroeder a qualifying offer when the season ended , making him an unrestricted free agent . He was then signed to a two @-@ year , two @-@ way contract by the Minnesota Wild on July 11 .

 Schroeder debuted with the American junior national team internationally at the 2007 IIHF World U18 Championships in Finland . He helped the United States to a silver medal as he finished third in tournament scoring with 11 points , behind American teammates Colin Wilson and James van Riemsdyk . 
 The following year , Schroeder was named to the under @-@ 20 team , the youngest on the team at 17 , for the 2008 World Junior Championships in the Czech Republic . He finished second in team scoring and tied for fourth in the tournament behind van Riemsdyk with one goal and seven assists for eight points in seven games . Three months later , Schroeder made his second U18 tournament appearance . Named the player of the game in the American 's match against Sweden , he recorded five points in seven games as the Americans earned a bronze medal . 
 At the 2009 World Junior Championships in Canada , Schroeder established the American record for most career assists at the tournament with 15 . The youngest player on the team , Schroeder was named the player of the game in a match against the Czech Republic , and led the Americans in scoring with 11 points . 
 On December 23 , 2009 , Schroeder was named to the American team for the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships , his third straight appearance at the World Junior Championships . The only player on the American team to play in two previous World Junior tournaments , Schroeder was also the first player from the University of Minnesota to participate in three tournaments . In a quarter @-@ final match against Finland Schroeder notched three assists , including his 26th career point in the tournament , which surpassed Jeremy Roenick for the highest career total for an American . His 20 career assists was the third highest total in the history of the tournament . In the gold @-@ medal game against Canada , Schroeder led the American team in shots on goal with six , scoring a goal on one of them . He finished with three goals and five assists in seven games as the Americans won the gold medal .

 = Localization of Square Enix video games = 
 The Japanese video game developer and publisher Square Enix ( formally two companies called Square and Enix prior to 2003 ) has been translating its games for North America and the PAL region since the late 1980s . It has not always released all of its games in all major regions , and continues to selectively release games even today depending on multiple factors such as the viability of platforms or the condition of the game itself . The process of localization has changed during that time from having a one @-@ person team with a short time and tight memory capacities to having a team of translators preparing simultaneous launches in multiple languages . 
 The companies ' first major projects were Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy , which each proved successful enough to launch video game franchises . Since then , the majority of the games produced by the companies have been localized for western audiences , although the process was not given a high priority at Square until the international success of Final Fantasy VII . Richard Honeywood was recruited to start a dedicated localization department at the company . Enix remained without a translation department until its merger with Square . In some cases , such as Alexander O. Smith , teams or individuals became attached to particular subseries . In recent years , the process of localization has undergone changes , mainly due to difficult experiences with various titles , and Square Enix has sometimes developed the titles in localized form first in order to appeal to the western market . 
 = = Staff = = 
 The localization staff at Square Enix works mainly from Japanese to English and the other way around , and from American English to British English , French , Italian , German , and Spanish . Prior to the merger of Square and Enix in 2003 , Enix did not initially have a localization department and outsourced its Western releases to translators who had no close contact with the original development teams . Square also did not initially have a localization department , though Kaoru Moriyama and Ted Woolsey worked with them regularly on a contractual basis . Following the massive international success of Final Fantasy VII , the company looked into improving the quality of its translated products — the game was widely criticized for its rushed translation , which had been handled entirely by Michael Baskett , the company 's only in @-@ house translator at the time . To that end , Square tasked Richard Honeywood , originally a programmer , with creating a dedicated localization team . His first major project was Xenogears . While there were only two members at first , including Honeywood , the staff grew to include more than 40 employees by 2007 , four years after the merger between Square and Enix . By the late 2000s , for self @-@ contained series or games linked by story events or similar elements , Square Enix can use the same localization team , as in the case of titles set in the fictional world of Ivalice . The translator most associated with the Ivalice games is Alexander O. Smith . Another noted translator is Tom Slattery , who has worked the localizations of the Nintendo DS remake of Final Fantasy IV , the Game Boy Advance port of Final Fantasy VI , and Final Fantasy XIII and its sequels . 
 = = Approach = = 
 Before a translation is greenlit and translators are allocated , the localization , quality assurance ( QA ) and marketing staff play through a build of the game and sometimes do a focus group study . The localization team 's playthrough can sometimes take over 100 hours of gameplay . Once the company <unk> a localization project , a period of brainstorming starts in which glossary , style , naming schemes and fonts are chosen . During the translation phase , voiced sections are translated first . Text files are cross @-@ checked by multiple translators and editors . The text is then integrated along with any graphic and sound changes , and the game goes to quality assurance . During a period of several weeks to up to three months , Japanese QA teams look for bugs while Western QA teams check linguistic issues . The localization team often re @-@ plays the game during this phase , translates the manuals and help out on the guidebooks if these are made . Finally , the game is sent to the hardware manufacturers to be approved . 
 Challenges for the localization teams include space limitation ( due to data storage and / or on @-@ screen space ) , achieving a natural dialogue flow despite multiple plot branches and script lines being stored out of order , and , when voiced footage is not re @-@ recorded for lip movement , dealing with file length and lip @-@ synch limitations . When the same team works on different games in a series such as Final Fantasy , they often need to adopt different writing styles depending on the setting of their games . Another point to consider is humorous elements that do not translate properly into English , and different cultural expectations about character interactions . The localization process depends on factors such as the development teams ' wishes , as well as budget and schedule . Translation usually starts late in development , although some titles , like Final Fantasy XI , are translated from Japanese to English during initial development , making the translators appear more like additional planners than actual translators . A few titles , like The Bouncer , have actually been developed in English first and only then translated to Japanese . The Last Remnant also adopted this approach , featuring motion @-@ capture and dialogue synched to English rather than Japanese actors . This was done due to the company 's wish to create a title for the international market . 
 Many early localizations , like other RPGs both then and in more recent years , made heavy use of antiquated speech patterns and archaic nouns such as " thee " and " thou " . Square was not greatly focused on their localizations before the worldwide commercial success of Final Fantasy VII . In later years , the original translators were joined by editors to catch grammar and spelling errors . Prior to the development of Final Fantasy XIII @-@ 2 , the standard localization process for a title involved dual development between the company 's sound and localization departments , which meant that difficulties could arise because of constant changes to dialogue . For XIII @-@ 2 and future large @-@ scale titles , an in @-@ house development tool called Moomle was developed to ensure all parts of the process were properly synchronized and centralized . The development of Moomle was initialized due to the troubled localization of Final Fantasy XIII , and spearheaded by the game 's translator Slattery and his Japanese counterpart Teruaki Sugawara . In recent years , localization teams have tended to adopt two different approaches to translation and localization : either they remain quite faithful to the original Japanese , or they can make large changes as long as the story outline remains the same . The former method was adopted for Final Fantasy XIII and its sequels , although some alterations were made in order to make the English dialogue sound natural . In choosing voice actors , the company prefers to avoid well @-@ known film and television actors , citing Ellen Page 's casting in Beyond : Two Souls as a counterexample .

 Honeywood described Xenogears , his first translation project at Square and the first to be handled internally by the company , as " pure hell " . He stated that he started to change the company 's approach to localization after that game , moving booths to always work very closely with the original development teams , improving communication with them , and introducing full @-@ time editors . Woolsey also had a troublesome time while localizing Secret of Mana , which he said " nearly killed [ him ] " . The translation was completed within a month of the Japanese release as Square wanted to catch the 1993 holiday season . Final Fantasy XIII 's localization , handled by Slattery and Sugawara , was also quite chaotic . According to Slattery , the lack of deadlines , poor communication and synchronization between the various departments , and continuing changes to the script and to cutscenes led to a turbulent development . Due to the script changes , large sections of dialogue needed to be re @-@ translated by Slattery and re @-@ recorded by the English actors due to lack of necessary emotional drive for the scenes . In contrast , Smith had a good working relationship with Yasumi Matsuno during the localization of titles like Vagrant Story , Final Fantasy XII and the 2010 re @-@ release of Tactics Ogre : Let Us Cling Together . The two worked closely to ensure that the western versions were faithful to Matsuno 's vision . A challenging localization was Final Fantasy X , the first Final Fantasy title to feature voice acting . There , the team faced problems in both making the dialogue more compatible with an English @-@ speaking audience and lip @-@ synching it roughly with in @-@ game characters , whose lip @-@ movement was still for the original Japanese dialogue . 
 = = Changes = = 
 When translating its video games , Square Enix tries to take into account the cultural differences between Japan and western territories . This sometimes involves rewriting dialogue or altering graphics , animations , and sounds . For instance , in Chocobo Racing , visual references to the Japanese folk heroes Momotarō and <unk> were changed to depict Hansel and Gretel , since the game was designed mainly for children , and Hansel and Gretel are better known in the west than Momotarō and <unk> . According to Honeywood , trying to explain to the original development teams why some changes are needed can range from " frustrating to downright hilarious " . Generally , older development teams trust the translators with making changes while newer teams can be more reluctant , though they usually build up trust gradually . The localization team for The World Ends with You chose to preserve the Japanese elements to ensure the game 's cultural aspect remained intact . While localizing Final Fantasy XII , Smith worked to preserve the original script 's meaning while using English dialects to reproduce the Japanese dialects found in the original version . He and translator Joseph Reeder also ended up using different accents to identify factions within the game . 
 Final Fantasy VII 's script was done by a small team , resulting in a rough script and inconsistencies . One of the more famous of these was the name of Aerith Gainsborough : the name was originally meant to be a merging of " Air " and " Earth " , but her name in the original game was translated as " Aeris " . During his localization of Secret of Mana , Woolsey was forced to trim down vast amounts of character dialogue due to an awkward fixed text font , later stating that he was satisfied with the result . Vagrant Story has been recognized as a high @-@ quality localization : whereas the original Japanese text was rather bland , the English version made use of archaic Medieval and Old English words and dialogue . With ports and remakes of older games , dialogue can be changed or added by the team , as in the case of Final Fantasy VI . The title can also be altered for various reasons . Final Fantasy IV and VI were released in western regions as Final Fantasy II and III . This was due to the fact that the original II and III had not received a western release . The Final Fantasy Legend was originally to be called The Great Warrior Saga , but changed it to its current title to tie in with the Final Fantasy series , which was well @-@ known and popular in the west . Dragon Quest , one of the earliest successful Japanese role @-@ playing games , had its title changed to Dragon Warrior so as not to confuse it with the similarly @-@ titled tabletop role @-@ playing game DragonQuest . The DragonQuest title was discontinued in 1987 , and Square Enix registered the Dragon Quest trademark for their use in 2003 . Also due to copyright issues , The World Ends with You could not be released under its original Japanese title It 's a Wonderful World . 
 Gameplay may be altered when it is felt that a game might be too easy or difficult for the Western audience . Some of the older Final Fantasy titles , such as Final Fantasy IV , were altered to be more easy to play in the West than in Japan , though their remakes and ports have generally restored the difficulty . Einhänder 's gameplay also received notable cuts for its North American release . On the other hand , Final Fantasy XII : Revenant Wings was made more difficult in localized versions because the Western market was judged " more familiar " with the real @-@ time strategy genre than the Japanese market . For the western release of Dissidia Final Fantasy , the game was changed to suit western players , including removing several RPG elements to make it more akin to an action game . Censorship can also affect the localized versions of the games and require obscuring mature themes , rewriting risque remarks or phrases , altering graphics or removing parts of some scenes . This was common in the NES and SNES eras but less drastic later on once video game content rating systems were established . Original western releases of early games in the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest featured multiple occurrences of this form of censorship . Final Fantasy VIII also received some censorship for its European release , including the removal of a Nazi @-@ like uniform . Less commonly , this also goes the other way , for instance with Final Fantasy XII , in which a sequence involving violence against a female character was censored in the Japanese version but restored in the American and European releases . References to religion can also be removed , as in Final Fantasy IV and VI . Such references in Xenogears caused Square to consider not releasing it in North America . 
 = = Releases = = 
 In 2008 , Square Enix expressed willingness to make worldwide " simultaneous releases the norm " . Concerning Final Fantasy XI , at the time of the original English @-@ only European release in 2004 , producer Hiromichi Tanaka had stated that while Japanese / North American / Australian simultaneous releases are possible due to translating only Japanese to English , it was not possible for European countries due to the difficulty of finding good Japanese @-@ to @-@ European @-@ languages translators , and the fact that second @-@ hand translations from the English would be akin to " Chinese whispers " . However , the team later integrated full @-@ fledged French and German localization teams , achieving simultaneous release from the Japanese for three different languages from 2007 on . Another example of synchronized localization is Final Fantasy XIII : the company started the localization process alongside the game 's development to lessen the delay between the local and international releases . 
 Final Fantasy XIV : A Realm Reborn was localized in @-@ house by Square Enix under supervision by Naoki Yoshida and Koji Fox . Compared to its predecessor , which featured English @-@ only voice @-@ overs , A Realm Reborn featured English , Japanese , German and French similar to Final Fantasy XI . The game featured voice work in a low number of cutscenes : this was explained by the fact that the team did not want new voice recording to dominate the creation of new content after the initial release . The western release of Lightning Returns : Final Fantasy XIII was delayed by over two months because of the large amount of dialogue , which changes due to the game 's time mechanic , that needed to be translated and recorded . 
 The viability of a game 's platform can also affect both the localization and the release , as in the case of the PlayStation Portable @-@ exclusive Final Fantasy Type @-@ 0 , which would eventually come west as a high definition port for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One , and Seiken Densetsu 3 , which was not localized due to undefined technical problems . The company has also recently started releasing Japanese voice tracks as downloadable content , as in the case of Lightning Returns : Final Fantasy XIII and one of the titles it has published , the Access Games @-@ developed Drakengard 3 . Another aspect of Square Enix 's policy concerning the western release of games was to make games that appealed to both western and Japanese audiences , but the worldwide success of the Japan @-@ aimed Bravely Default caused them to rethink their strategy . 
 = = = Additional content = = = 
 The localized versions sometimes expand on the original games . For example , when Honeywood found contradictions in the story of Chrono Cross , he worked with Masato Kato , the director and scenario writer of the game , to rewrite sections and add explanatory dialogue which was not in the original version . For Dragon Quest VIII : Journey of the Cursed King , voice @-@ overs and orchestral music were recorded for the Western releases , while the original Japanese version did not have them . Generally , gameplay content left out of the original game due to time constraints may be completed and added in the localized versions . Sometimes , the expanded localized versions of games from series like Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy are re @-@ released in Japan . The re @-@ releases are usually based on a direct port of the North American releases , with only text translated back in Japanese and Japanese subtitles to English dialogue . They can also include features and tweaks previously only available in the western version alongside other additions . 
 = = Reception = = 
 1UP.com 's Wesley Fenlon praised Square Enix for the high quality of its translations , especially as space allocated for text and dialogue had been expanded with new and re @-@ released versions of games . Jeremy Parish , writing for the same site , said that the quality of Square Enix 's localizations had " gone from laughable [ ... ] to some of the best around . " Both praise and criticism has been given to individual games for the quality of their localizations . Xenogears , the company 's first game to feature voice acting , drew criticism in regard to its audio presentation , while The Bouncer received a fairly positive response . Final Fantasy X received praise , although poor lip @-@ synching and some aspects of the actors ' performances were criticized . The English release of X @-@ 2 ended up receiving the Seventh Annual Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences award in 2004 for Outstanding Achievement in Character Performance . Final Fantasy XII and Vagrant Story were both highly praised for the qualities of their localizations . 
 = Italian battleship Conte di Cavour = 
 Conte di Cavour was the name ship of the three Conte di Cavour @-@ class battleships built for the Royal Italian Navy ( Regia Marina ) in the 1910s . She served during both World War I and World War II , although she was little used and saw no combat during the former . The ship supported operations during the Corfu Incident in 1923 and spent much of the rest of the decade in reserve . She was rebuilt between 1933 and 1937 with more powerful guns , additional armor and considerably more speed than before . 
 Both Conte di Cavour and her sister ship , Giulio Cesare , participated in the Battle of Calabria in July 1940 , where the latter was lightly damaged . They were both present when British torpedo bombers attacked the fleet at Taranto in November 1940 , and Conte di Cavour was torpedoed . She was deliberately grounded , with most of her hull underwater , and her repairs were not completed before the Italian surrender in September 1943 . The ship was then captured by the Germans , but they made no use of her . She was damaged in an Allied air raid in early 1945 and capsized seven days later . Conte di Cavour was eventually scrapped in 1946 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Conte di Cavour was 168 @.@ 9 meters ( 554 ft 2 in ) long at the waterline , and 176 meters ( 577 ft 5 in ) long overall . The ship had a beam of 28 meters ( 91 ft 10 in ) , and a draft of 9 @.@ 3 meters ( 30 ft 6 in ) . She displaced 23 @,@ 088 long tons ( 23 @,@ 458 t ) at normal load , and 25 @,@ 086 long tons ( 25 @,@ 489 t ) at deep load . She had a crew of 31 officers and 969 enlisted men . The ship 's machinery consisted of four Parsons steam turbines , each driving one propeller shaft . Steam for the turbines was provided by 20 Blechynden water @-@ tube boilers , eight of which burned fuel oil , and twelve which burned both oil and coal . Designed to reach a maximum speed of 22 @.@ 5 knots ( 41 @.@ 7 km / h ; 25 @.@ 9 mph ) from 31 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 23 @,@ 000 kW ) , Conte di Cavour failed to reach this goal on her sea trials , despite generally exceeding the rated power of her turbines . The ship only made a maximum speed of 22 @.@ 2 knots ( 41 @.@ 1 km / h ; 25 @.@ 5 mph ) using 31 @,@ 278 shp ( 23 @,@ 324 kW ) . She had a cruising radius of 4 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 900 km ; 5 @,@ 500 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of thirteen 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) guns in three triple @-@ gun turret and two twin @-@ gun turrets , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' Q ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' from front to rear . The secondary battery comprised eighteen 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns , all mounted in casemates in the sides of the hull . Conte di Cavour was also armed with fourteen 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns . As was customary for capital ships of the period , she was equipped with three submerged 450 mm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes . She was protected with Krupp cemented steel manufactured by Terni . The belt armor was 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) thick and the main deck was 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick . The conning tower and main battery turrets were protected with 280 mm ( 11 in ) worth of armor plating . 
 = = Modifications and reconstruction = = 
 Shortly after the end of World War I , the number of 50 @-@ caliber 76 mm guns was reduced to 13 , all mounted on the turret tops , and six new 40 @-@ caliber 76 @-@ millimeter anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel . In addition two license @-@ built 2 @-@ pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck . In 1925 – 26 the foremast was replaced by a four @-@ legged mast , which was moved forward of the funnels , the rangefinders were upgraded , and the ship was equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret . Around that same time she was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the forecastle . 
 Conte di Cavour began an extensive reconstruction in October 1933 at the CRDA Trieste shipyard that lasted until June 1937 . A new bow section was grafted over the existing bow , which increased her length by 10 @.@ 31 meters ( 33 ft 10 in ) to 186 @.@ 4 meters ( 611 ft 7 in ) and her beam increased to 28 @.@ 6 meters ( 93 ft 10 in ) . The ship 's draft at deep load increased to 10 @.@ 02 meters ( 32 ft 10 in ) . All of the changes made increased her displacement to 26 @,@ 140 long tons ( 26 @,@ 560 t ) at standard load and 29 @,@ 100 long tons ( 29 @,@ 600 t ) at deep load . The ship 's crew increased to 1 @,@ 260 officers and enlisted men . Two of the propeller shafts were removed and the existing turbines were replaced by two Belluzzo geared steam turbines rated at 75 @,@ 000 shp ( 56 @,@ 000 kW ) . The boilers were replaced by eight Yarrow boilers . In service her maximum speed was about 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) and she had a range of 6 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 900 km ; 7 @,@ 400 mi ) at a speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) . 
 The main guns were bored out to 320 millimeters ( 12 @.@ 6 in ) and the center turret and the torpedo tubes were removed . All of the existing secondary armament and AA guns were replaced by a dozen 120 mm guns in six twin @-@ gun turrets and eight 102 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 0 in ) AA guns in twin turrets . In addition the ship was fitted with a dozen Breda 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) light AA guns in six twin @-@ gun mounts and twelve 13 @.@ 2 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 52 in ) Breda M31 anti @-@ aircraft machine guns , also in twin mounts . In 1940 the 13 @.@ 2 mm machine guns were replaced by 20 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) AA guns in twin mounts . The tetrapodal mast was replaced with a new forward conning tower , protected with 260 @-@ millimeter ( 10 @.@ 2 in ) thick armor . Atop the conning tower there was a fire @-@ control director fitted with two large stereo @-@ rangefinders , with a base length of 7 @.@ 2 meters ( 23 @.@ 6 ft ) . 
 The deck armor was increased during the reconstruction to a total of 135 millimeters ( 5 @.@ 3 in ) over the engine and boiler rooms and 166 millimeters ( 6 @.@ 5 in ) over the magazines , although its distribution over three decks , each with multiple layers , meant that it was considerably less effective than a single plate of the same thickness . The armor protecting the barbettes was reinforced with 50 @-@ millimeter ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) plates . All this armor weighed a total of 3 @,@ 227 long tons ( 3 @,@ 279 t ) . The existing underwater protection was replaced by the Pugliese torpedo defense system ; a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb the blast of a torpedo warhead . It lacked enough depth to be fully effective against contemporary torpedoes . A major problem of the reconstruction was that the ship 's increased draft meant that their waterline armor belt was almost completely submerged with any significant load .

 Conte di Cavour , named after the statesman Count Camillo <unk> di Cavour , was laid down at La Spezia Arsenale , La Spezia , on 10 August 1910 , and launched on 10 August 1911 . She was completed on 1 April 1915 , and served as a flagship in the southern Adriatic Sea during World War I. She saw no action , however , and spent little time at sea . Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel , the Italian naval chief of staff , believed that Austro @-@ Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic . The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way . Instead , Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet , while smaller vessels , such as MAS torpedo boats , conducted raids on Austro @-@ Hungarian ships and installations . Meanwhile , Revel 's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro @-@ Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement . 
 In 1919 she sailed to North America and visited ports in the United States as well as Halifax , Canada . The ship was mostly inactive in 1921 because of personnel shortages , and was refitted at La Spezia from November to March 1922 . Conte di Cavour and Giulio Cesare supported Italian operations on Corfu in 1923 after an Italian general and his staff were murdered on Corfu ; Benito Mussolini was not satisfied with the Greek Government 's response , so he ordered Italian troops to occupy the island . Conte di Cavour bombarded the town with her 76 mm guns , killing 20 and wounding 32 civilians . She escorted King Victor Emmanuel III and his wife aboard the battleship Dante Alighieri on a state visit to Spain in 1924 , and was placed in reserve upon her return until 1926 , when she conveyed Mussolini on a voyage to Libya . The ship was again placed in reserve from 1927 until 1933 , when she began her reconstruction . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 Early in World War II , the Conte di Cavour and her sister took part in the Battle of Calabria ( also known as the Battle of Punto Stilo ) on 9 July 1940 . They were part of the 1st Battle Squadron , commanded by Admiral Inigo Campioni , during which they engaged major elements of the British Mediterranean Fleet . The British were escorting a convoy from Malta to Alexandria , while the Italians had finished escorting another from Naples to Benghazi , Libya . Admiral Andrew Cunningham , commander of the Mediterranean Fleet , attempted to interpose his ships between the Italians and their base at Taranto . Crews on the fleets spotted each other in the middle of the afternoon and the Italian battleships opened fire at 15 : 53 at a range of nearly 27 @,@ 000 meters ( 29 @,@ 000 yd ) . The two leading British battleships , HMS Warspite and Malaya , replied a minute later . Three minutes after she opened fire , shells from Giulio Cesare began to straddle Warspite which made a small turn and increased speed , to throw off the Italian ship 's aim , at 16 : 00 . At that same time , a shell from Warspite struck Giulio Cesare at a distance of about 24 @,@ 000 meters ( 26 @,@ 000 yd ) . Uncertain how severe the damage was , Campioni ordered his battleships to turn away in the face of superior British numbers and they successfully disengaged . Repairs to Giulio Cesare were completed by the end of August and both ships unsuccessfully attempted to intercept British convoys to Malta in August and September . 
 On the night of 11 November 1940 , Conte di Cavour was at anchor in Taranto harbor when she was attacked by 21 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from the British aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious , along with several other warships . The ship 's gunners shot down one Swordfish shortly after the aircraft dropped its torpedo , but it exploded underneath ' B ' turret at 23 : 15 , knocking out the main bow pump . Her captain requested tugboats to help ground the ship on a nearby 12 @-@ meter ( 39 ft ) sandbank at 23 : 27 , but Admiral Bruno <unk> , commander of the 5th Battleship Division , vetoed the request until it was too late and Conte di Cavour had to use a deeper , 17 @-@ meter ( 56 ft ) , sandbank at 04 : 45 the following morning . She initially grounded on an even keel , but temporarily took on a 50 @-@ degree list before settling to the bottom at 08 : 00 with a 11 @.@ 5 @-@ degree list . Only her superstructure and gun turrets were above water by this time . 
 Conte di Cavour had the lowest priority for salvage among the three battleships sunk during the attack and little work was done for several months . The first priority was to patch the holes in the hull and then her guns and parts of her superstructure were removed to lighten the ship . False bulwarks were welded to the upper sides of the hull to prevent water from reentering the hull and pumping the water overboard began in May 1941 . Some 15 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 15 @,@ 000 long tons ) of water were pumped out before Conte di Cavour was refloated on 9 June and entered the ex @-@ Austro @-@ Hungarian floating dry dock GO @-@ 12 on 12 July . The damage was more extensive than originally thought and temporary repairs to enable the ship to reach Trieste for permanent repairs took until 22 December . 
 Her guns were operable by September 1942 , but replacing her entire electrical system took longer so the navy took advantage of the delays and incorporated some modifications based on lessons learned from the attack . Other changes planned were the replacement of her secondary and anti @-@ aircraft weapons with a dozen 135 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 3 in ) dual @-@ purpose guns in twin mounts , twelve 65 @-@ millimeter ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) , and twenty @-@ three 20 mm AA guns . The repair work was suspended in June 1943 , with an estimated six months work left to do on Conte di Cavour remaining , in order to expedite the construction of urgently needed smaller ships . She was captured by the Germans on 8 September when Italy surrendered to the Allies , and was reduced to a hulk . She was damaged in an air raid on 17 February 1945 , and capsized on 23 February . Refloated shortly after the end of the war , Conte di Cavour was scrapped in 1946 .
