 = = Behaviour = = 
 Adult tuatara are terrestrial and nocturnal reptiles , though they will often bask in the sun to warm their bodies . Hatchlings hide under logs and stones , and are diurnal , likely because adults are cannibalistic . Tuatara thrive in temperatures much lower than those tolerated by most reptiles , and hibernate during winter . They remain active at temperatures as low as 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) , while temperatures over 28 ° C ( 82 ° F ) are generally fatal . The optimal body temperature for the tuatara is from 16 to 21 ° C ( 61 to 70 ° F ) , the lowest of any reptile . The body temperature of tuatara is lower than that of other reptiles , ranging from 5 @.@ 2 – 11 @.@ 2 ° C ( 41 @.@ 4 – 52 @.@ 2 ° F ) over a day , whereas most reptiles have body temperatures around 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) . The low body temperature results in a slower metabolism . 
 Burrowing seabirds such as petrels , prions , and shearwaters share the tuatara 's island habitat during the birds ' nesting seasons . The tuatara use the birds ' burrows for shelter when available , or dig their own . The seabirds ' guano helps to maintain invertebrate populations on which tuatara predominantly prey ; including beetles , crickets , and spiders . Their diets also consist of frogs , lizards , and bird 's eggs and chicks . The eggs and young of seabirds that are seasonally available as food for tuatara may provide beneficial fatty acids . Tuatara of both sexes defend territories , and will threaten and eventually bite intruders . The bite can cause serious injury . Tuatara will bite when approached , and will not let go easily . 
 = = Reproduction = = 
 Tuatara reproduce very slowly , taking 10 to 20 years to reach sexual maturity . Mating occurs in midsummer ; females mate and lay eggs once every four years . During courtship , a male makes his skin darker , raises his crests , and parades toward the female . He slowly walks in circles around the female with stiffened legs . The female will either submit , and allow the male to mount her , or retreat to her burrow . Males do not have a penis ; they reproduce by the male lifting the tail of the female and placing his vent over hers . The sperm is then transferred into the female , much like the mating process in birds . 
 Tuatara eggs have a soft , parchment @-@ like shell . It takes the females between one and three years to provide eggs with yolk , and up to seven months to form the shell . It then takes between 12 and 15 months from copulation to hatching . This means reproduction occurs at two- to five @-@ year intervals , the slowest in any reptile . Wild tuatara are known to be still reproducing at about 60 years of age ; " Henry " , a male tuatara at Southland Museum in Invercargill , New Zealand , became a father ( possibly for the first time ) on 23 January 2009 , at the age of 111 . 
 The sex of a hatchling depends on the temperature of the egg , with warmer eggs tending to produce male tuatara , and cooler eggs producing females . Eggs incubated at 21 ° C ( 70 ° F ) have an equal chance of being male or female . However , at 22 ° C ( 72 ° F ) , 80 % are likely to be males , and at 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) , 80 % are likely to be females ; at 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) all hatchlings will be females . Some evidence indicates sex determination in tuatara is determined by both genetic and environmental factors . 
 Tuatara probably have the slowest growth rates of any reptile , continuing to grow larger for the first 35 years of their lives . The average lifespan is about 60 years , but they can live to be well over 100 years old . Some experts believe that captive tuatara could live as long as 200 years .

 = = = Distribution and threats = = = 
 Tuatara were once widespread on New Zealand 's main North and South Islands , where subfossil remains have been found in sand dunes , caves , and Māori middens . Wiped out from the main islands before European settlement , they were long confined to 32 offshore islands free of mammals . The islands are difficult to get to , and are colonised by few animal species , indicating that some animals absent from these islands may have caused tuatara to disappear from the mainland . However , <unk> ( Polynesian rats ) had recently become established on several of the islands , and tuatara were persisting , but not breeding , on these islands . Additionally , tuatara were much rarer on the rat @-@ inhabited islands . 
 The recent discovery of a tuatara hatchling on the mainland indicates that attempts to re @-@ establish a breeding population on the New Zealand mainland have had some success . The total population of tuatara is estimated to be greater than 60 @,@ 000 , but less than 100 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Eradication of rats = = = 
 Tuatara were removed from Stanley , Red Mercury and Cuvier Islands in 1990 and 1991 , and maintained in captivity to allow Polynesian rats to be eradicated on those islands . All three populations bred in captivity , and after successful eradication of the rats , all individuals , including the new juveniles , were returned to their islands of origin . In the 1991 – 92 season , Little Barrier Island was found to hold only eight tuatara , which were taken into in situ captivity , where females produced 42 eggs , which were incubated at Victoria University . The resulting offspring were subsequently held in an enclosure on the island , then released into the wild in 2006 after rats were eradicated there . 
 In the Hen and Chicken Islands , Pacific rats were eradicated on <unk> in 1993 , Lady Alice Island in 1994 , and Coppermine Island in 1997 . Following this program , juveniles have once again been seen on the latter three islands . In contrast , rats persist on Hen Island of the same group , and no juvenile tuatara had been seen there as of 2001 . In the Alderman Islands , Middle Chain Island holds no tuatara , but it is considered possible for rats to swim between Middle Chain and other islands that do hold tuatara , and the rats were eradicated in 1992 to prevent this . Another rodent eradication was carried out on the <unk> Islands east of D 'Urville Island , to prepare for the release of 432 Cook Strait tuatara juveniles in 2004 , which were being raised at Victoria University as of 2001 . 
 = = = = Brothers Island tuatara = = = = 
 Sphenodon guntheri is present naturally on one small island with a population of approximately 400 . In 1995 , 50 juvenile and 18 adult Brothers Island tuatara were moved to Titi Island in Cook Strait , and their establishment monitored . Two years later , more than half of the animals had been seen again and of those all but one had gained weight . In 1998 , 34 juveniles from captive breeding and 20 wild @-@ caught adults were similarly transferred to Matiu / Somes Island , a more publicly accessible location within Wellington Harbour . The captive juveniles were from induced <unk> from wild females . 
 In late October 2007 , 50 tuatara collected as eggs from North Brother Island and hatched at Victoria University were being released onto Long Island in the outer Marlborough Sounds . The animals had been cared for at Wellington Zoo for the last five years and have been kept in secret in a specially built enclosure at the zoo , off display . 
 There is another out of country population of Brothers Island tuatara that was given to the San Diego Zoological Society and is housed off @-@ display at the San Diego Zoo facility in Balboa . No successful reproductive efforts have been reported yet . 
 = = = = Northern tuatara = = = = 
 Sphenodon punctatus naturally occurs on 29 islands , and its population is estimated to be over 60 @,@ 000 individuals . In 1996 , 32 adult northern tuatara were moved from <unk> Island to Moutohora . The carrying capacity of Moutohora is estimated at 8 @,@ 500 individuals , and the island could allow public viewing of wild tuatara . In 2003 , 60 northern tuatara were introduced to <unk> Matangi Island from Middle Island in the Mercury group . They are occasionally seen sunbathing by visitors to the island . 
 A mainland release of S. punctatus occurred in 2005 in the heavily fenced and monitored Karori Sanctuary . The second mainland release took place in October 2007 , when a further 130 were transferred from Stephens Island to the Karori Sanctuary . In early 2009 , the first recorded wild @-@ born offspring were observed . 
 = = = Captive breeding = = = 
 The first successful breeding of Tuatara in captivity is believed to have achieved by Sir Algernon Thomas ( 1857 @-@ 1937 ) at either his University offices or residence in Symonds Street in the late 1880s or his new home , <unk> , in Mount Eden in the early 1890s . 
 Several tuatara breeding programmes are active within New Zealand . Southland Museum and Art Gallery in Invercargill was the first institution to have a tuatara breeding programme ; they breed S. punctatus . 
 Hamilton Zoo , Auckland Zoo and Wellington Zoo also breed tuatara for release into the wild . At Auckland Zoo in the 1990s it was discovered that the temperature at which the eggs are incubated determines the sex of the animal . 
 The Victoria University of Wellington maintains a research programme into the captive breeding of tuatara , and the <unk> Mount Bruce Wildlife Centre keeps a pair and a juvenile . 
 The <unk> Trust has a tuatara breeding enclosure at <unk> . One notable captive breeding success story took place in January 2009 , when all 11 eggs belonging to 110 @-@ year @-@ old tuatara Henry and 80 @-@ year @-@ old tuatara Mildred hatched . This story is especially remarkable as Henry required surgery to remove a cancerous tumour in order to successfully breed . 
 In January 2016 Chester Zoo announced that they succeeded in breeding the tuatara in captivity first time outside its homeland . 
 = = Cultural significance = = 
 Tuatara feature in a number of indigenous legends , and are held as ariki ( God forms ) . Tuatara are regarded as the messengers of <unk> , the god of death and disaster , and Māori women are forbidden to eat them . Tuatara also indicate tapu ( the borders of what is sacred and restricted ) , beyond which there is mana , meaning there could be serious consequences if that boundary is crossed . Māori women would sometimes tattoo images of lizards , some of which may represent tuatara , near their genitals . Today , tuatara are regarded as a <unk> ( special treasure ) . 
 The tuatara was featured on one side of the New Zealand five @-@ cent coin , which was phased out in October 2006 . Tuatara was also the name of the Journal of the Biological Society of Victoria University College and subsequently Victoria University of Wellington , published from 1947 until 1993 . It has now been digitised by the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre , also at Victoria .

 = 2006 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 2006 Atlantic hurricane season was significantly less active than the record previous season . It marked the first season since 2001 in which no hurricanes made landfall in the United States , and was the first since 1994 in which no tropical cyclones formed during October . Following the intense activity of 2005 , forecasters predicted that the 2006 season would be only slightly less active . Instead activity was slowed by a rapidly forming moderate El Niño event , the presence of the Saharan Air Layer over the tropical Atlantic , and the steady presence of a robust secondary high pressure area to the Azores high centered on Bermuda . There were no tropical cyclones after October 2 . 
 Tropical Storm Alberto was indirectly responsible for two deaths when it made landfall in Florida . Hurricane Ernesto caused heavy rainfall in Haiti , and directly killed at least seven in Haiti and the United States . Four hurricanes formed after Ernesto , including the strongest storms of the season , Hurricanes Helene and Gordon . In total , the season was responsible for 14 deaths and $ 500 million ( 2006 USD ; $ 587 million 2016 USD ) in damage . The calendar year 2006 also saw Tropical Storm Zeta , which arose in December 2005 and persisted until early January , only the second such event on record . The storm can be considered a part of the 2005 and 2006 seasons , although it occurred outside the June 1 – November 30 period during which most Atlantic basin tropical cyclones form . 
 = = Seasonal forecasts = = 
 Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts Philip J. Klotzbach , Dr. William M. Gray , and their associates at Colorado State University ; and separately by NOAA forecasters . 
 Klotzbach 's team ( formerly led by Gray ) has defined the average number of storms per season ( 1950 – 2000 ) as 9 @.@ 6 tropical storms , 5 @.@ 9 hurricanes , and 2 @.@ 3 major hurricanes ( storms exceeding Category 3 strength in the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale ) . A normal season , as defined by NOAA , has 6 – 14 named storms , with 4 – 8 of those reaching hurricane strength , and 1 – 3 major hurricanes . 
 = = = Pre @-@ season forecasts = = = 
 On December 5 , 2005 , Klotzbach 's team issued its initial extended @-@ range forecast for the 2006 season , predicting an above average of 17 named storms , nine of them hurricanes , and five classified as Category 3 intensity or higher . 
 As in the 2005 season , the team predicted it was highly probable that at least one major hurricane would directly impact the United States . The forecast suggested an 81 % probability that at least one major hurricane would strike the U.S. mainland , a 64 % chance of at least one major hurricane striking the East Coast of the United States ( including the Florida peninsula ) , and a 47 % chance of at least one major hurricane striking the Gulf Coast of the United States from the Florida Panhandle westward . The team also predicted that the potential for major hurricane activity in the Caribbean was above average . A few months later , on April 4 , 2006 , CSU issued another forecast confirming its December predictions . 
 On May 22 , 2006 , NOAA released its pre @-@ season forecast for the 2006 season . The prediction was for 13 – 16 named storms , 8 – 10 of those becoming hurricanes , and 4 – 6 becoming major hurricanes . 
 On May 31 , 2006 , Klotzbach 's team released its final pre @-@ season forecast for 2006 , confirming its earlier prediction . 
 = = = Midseason outlooks = = = 
 On August 3 , 2006 , Klotzbach 's team lowered its season estimate to 15 named storms , with 7 becoming hurricanes and 3 becoming major hurricanes , noting that conditions had become less favorable for storms than they had been earlier in the year . The sea @-@ level pressure and trade wind strength in the tropical Atlantic were reported to be above normal , while sea surface temperature anomalies were on a decreasing trend . 
 On August 8 , 2006 , NOAA revised its season estimate to 12 – 15 named storms , with 7 – 9 becoming hurricanes and 3 – 4 becoming major hurricanes . The reduction was attributed to less favorable environmental conditions , a decrease in La Niña conditions , and the lack of a " very persistent upper @-@ level ridge pattern over the eastern U.S. and western Atlantic . " 
 On September 1 , Klotzbach 's team also revised its season estimate , to 13 named storms , 5 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes , citing a larger volume of the Saharan Air Layer and an El Niño trend in the Pacific . The team again reduced the number of tropical storms expected for the season a month later , on October 3 , with an updated forecast of 11 named storms , 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes , citing the ongoing El Niño .

 Tropical Storm Zeta formed on December 30 , 2005 , and lasted until January 6 , 2006 . Although the majority of its existence was spent in 2006 , it is officially a storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season because that is the year in which it formed . Zeta joined Hurricane Alice as only the second North Atlantic tropical cyclone in recorded history to span two calendar years . 
 The season started on June 1 , 2006 , and officially ended on November 30 , 2006 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical <unk> form in the Atlantic basin . Ten days into the start of the season , Tropical Storm Alberto developed in the Caribbean Sea , and after four months of activity , Hurricane Isaac dissipated on October 3 south of Newfoundland . Compared to the devastating 2005 Atlantic hurricane season , 2006 was not severe in terms of deaths and damage . Three tropical storms made landfall in the United States . The first of them , Tropical Storm Alberto , made landfall in Florida with winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , causing flooding and light damage . Tropical Storm Beryl made landfall on Nantucket , but left little impact . The third and more significant storm was Hurricane Ernesto , which killed two people in Virginia and two in Florida , as well as causing $ 500 million in damage ( 2006 USD ) . During the season , only one tropical cyclone in the Atlantic – Alberto – affected Mexico . Canada was affected by several tropical cyclones during 2006 , including Alberto , the unnamed storm , Beryl , Florence , and Isaac . 
 On June 20 , an upper @-@ level disturbance formed east of the Bahamas and moved westward across the islands . Between June 24 and 26 , areas of convection developed occasionally , and a low @-@ level disturbance formed . The system turned northward and upon reaching the Gulf Stream on June 27 , it began to mature . It made landfall near Morehead City , North Carolina and moved northeastward along the U.S. East Coast . The storm contributed to severe and deadly flooding in the Mid @-@ Atlantic States . While the NHC did not operationally classify it , data from reconnaissance aircraft , NEXRAD weather radar , and surface observations suggest it may have met the criteria for a tropical cyclone . 
 The National Hurricane Center 's pre @-@ season activity outlook predicted 13 – 16 named storms , 8 – 10 hurricanes and 4 – 6 major hurricanes . They also predicted a high risk of at least one major hurricane strike to the Southeast United States . In the event , only ten storms formed during the season , the lowest number since the 1997 season , when there were seven . Five of the ten storms developed into hurricanes — also the lowest number since 1997 — and only two attained major hurricane status , tying with 2002 for the fewest since 1997 . Only one named storm was observed during October , the lowest number since 1994 , when none were seen during that month . Additionally , only three named storms made landfall in the United States , the fewest since 2001 . Because of several factors , including a rapidly forming El Niño event , the Saharan Air Layer over the tropical Atlantic and the presence of a high pressure area to the Azores high situated near Bermuda , it contributed to a below average season . Also , sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic were just at or slightly below average . In contrast , sea surface temperatures during the 2005 season were well above average . 
 Overall , the season 's activity was reflected with a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 79 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots ( 39 mph , 63 km / h ) or tropical storm strength . Subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total .

 = = = Tropical Storm Alberto = = = 
 On June 10 , an area of disturbed weather associated with a broad low pressure area off the coast of Belize organized over the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea into the first tropical depression of the season . It dropped light rainfall in Mexico , with a 24 @-@ hour total peaking at 4 inches ( 100 mm ) in Peto , Yucatán . Southwesterly vertical wind shear initially prevented significant development , but as it moved closer to Florida , the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on June 11 . Passing over the warm , deep water of the Loop Current allowed accelerated development , and the cyclone reached its peak winds of 70 mph ( 115 km / h ) , just shy of hurricane strength . Subsequent weakening occurred as it moved over the cooler waters of the continental shelf , and Alberto made landfall near Adams Beach , Florida , on June 14 with winds of about 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) . Losing its tropical characteristics , Alberto moved northeastward and produced heavy rainfall in South Carolina and North Carolina . The remnants tracked off the East Coast and transitioned into a powerful extratropical storm which affected Nova Scotia with high winds , heavy rain , and rough surf , leaving four fisherman missing offshore . 
 Alberto caused record rainfall in North Carolina , peaking at eight in ( 200 mm ) . In Florida , two people died , and damage was estimated at $ 250 @,@ 000 ( 2006 USD ) . Later , the storm left four sailors missing about 230 miles ( 370 km ) south of Nova Scotia . 
 = = = Unnamed Tropical Storm = = = 
 A cold front exited the eastern United States on July 13 and subsequently stalled over the western Atlantic Ocean . It decayed and dissipated , leaving behind two areas of low pressure . The southern area near North Carolina became Tropical Storm Beryl , and the northern system became an extratropical low on July 16 south @-@ southeast of Cape Cod , Massachusetts . Moving northeastward over warm waters , the system separated itself from the dissipating front later that day . Convection developed near the center , and the system transitioned into a tropical depression early on July 17 about 240 miles ( 390 km ) southeast of Nantucket , Massachusetts . Accelerating northeastward , the depression intensified into a tropical storm six hours later . Banding features became prominent , and after continued strengthening , the storm attained peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) late on July 17 , while located about 245 miles ( 395 km ) south of Halifax , Nova Scotia . Shortly thereafter , the storm encountered much cooler water temperatures after leaving the Gulf Stream . The storm quickly weakened as the convection rapidly diminished , and on July 18 degenerated into a non @-@ convective remnant low . The remnants crossed Newfoundland before turning to the east @-@ northeast and dissipating on July 19 . The storm greatly weakened prior to moving across Newfoundland , and as a result impact was minimal . 
 Operationally , the storm was considered as a non @-@ tropical gale , connected to a cold front . However , a post @-@ season analysis provided enough evidence of tropical characteristics , indicating no frontal features and no cold air intrusion at the time of peak winds . Observations analyzed the storm as having a symmetric warm @-@ core , whereas in real time it was considered subtropical . The National Hurricane Center officially re @-@ classified the system as an unnamed tropical storm on December 15 , 2006 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Beryl = = = 
 The same frontal system that developed the previous system spawned another low pressure area east of North Carolina . On July 18 , it developed into a tropical depression , and with associated deep convection , the storm organized sufficiently to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Beryl on July 19 . It tracked northeast and passed over Nantucket before dissipating southwest of Nova Scotia on July 21 . Waves along the southern coast of Nantucket reached 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) in height as the storm approached the island , resulting in four people being rescued by lifeguards from rip currents . The remnants of Tropical Storm Beryl dropped moderate precipitation in Atlantic Canada , with totals of up to 3 @.@ 5 inches ( 88 mm ) ; in some locations 1 inch ( 25 mm ) of rain fell in an hour . Moderate winds were reported along its path , which peaked at 60 mph ( 96 km / h ) in southern Nova Scotia . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Chris = = = 
 By late July , a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and traversed the Atlantic Ocean . The associated convection organized and became a tropical depression on July 31 about 160 miles ( 260 km ) east of Antigua . The depression tracked westward and soon intensified into Tropical Storm Chris before reaching peak winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) northeast of the United States Virgin Islands . The storm was forecast to strengthen further and become a hurricane as it moved into the Bahamas . However , Chris began to be affected by wind shear and became disorganized . The storm weakened to a tropical depression on August 4 , and dissipated as it approached the Cuban coast on August 5 . 
 The storm 's effects were limited to moderate rainfall in Hispaniola and Cuba . Cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean re @-@ routed their ships to avoid the storm . In Puerto Rico , rainfall from the storm caused the Fajardo River to overflow its banks . The overflown waters temporarily closed a highway in the northeastern portion of the island . Rainfall reached up to 2 inches ( 50 mm ) across portions of Hispaniola , the Turks and Caicos , the Bahamas , and eastern Cuba , and reached 4 inches ( 100 mm ) in some mountainous areas . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Debby = = = 
 On August 20 a tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa for the Atlantic Ocean . Immediately following , the wave developed convective banding and a broad circulation . At 1800 UTC on August 21 , a tropical depression formed to the south @-@ southeast of the Cape Verde Islands . The depression was a large , well @-@ organized system , and tracking west @-@ northwestward it intensified into Tropical Storm Debby on August 23 . 
 Later on August 23 , the storm attained peak winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , which it maintained for about two days . However , Debby entered a dry and stable air mass and deteriorated in organization . An upper @-@ level trough increased southerly wind shear and displaced the convection from the center . The cyclone began to weaken , and on August 26 Debby weakened to a tropical depression before degenerating into a remnant low . The circulation lasted another two days . 
 = = = Hurricane Ernesto = = = 
 Hurricane Ernesto originated from a tropical wave which moved off the coast of Africa on August 18 . The wave progressed westward and reached the Western Atlantic , spawning a tropical depression on August 24 near the Windward Islands . It moved west @-@ northwestward through the Caribbean Sea and intensified into Tropical Storm Ernesto on August 25 . The storm briefly attained hurricane status on August 27 to the southwest of Haiti , before land interaction caused weakening . Ernesto made landfall near Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , early in the morning on August 28 as a tropical storm . At one point the storm was predicted to become a major hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico and threaten parts of the Gulf Coast . However , Ernesto moved much farther east than anticipated , and made landfall as a tropical storm on the southern tip of Florida on August 29 . Ernesto retained tropical storm strength as it crossed Florida and emerged from land near Cape Canaveral , and was just below hurricane strength when it made landfall again in North Carolina on August 31 . Ernesto transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Virginia on September 1 , which ultimately dissipated over Quebec on September 4 . 
 Early in its duration , Ernesto killed five people in Haiti from rainfall . Later , two people died in Florida in traffic accidents due to slick roads . Damage was heaviest in Virginia , where heavy rains left severe flooding . Damage in the United States was estimated at $ 500 million ( 2006 USD ) . 
 = = = Hurricane Florence = = = 
 Hurricane Florence originated on September 3 from the complex merging of two tropical waves , creating one large low pressure area . The disturbance moved westward and became a tropical depression in the open waters of the Atlantic . On September 5 , it organized further and was upgraded into Tropical Storm Florence . With a disorganized structure and multiple circulation centers , Florence remained a weak tropical storm for several days , even after external conditions became favorable for strengthening . Florence tracked west @-@ northwest and intensified into a hurricane on September 10 while south of Bermuda . The storm passed just to the east of Bermuda as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane scale as it reached its peak intensity of 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) . It moved north before losing its tropical characteristics and passing over the Canadian Maritimes as a strong extratropical storm . 
 Large swells , rip tide , and undertow were reported on Bermuda , the Leeward Islands , the Virgin Islands , and Hispaniola . Florence affected Bermuda with wind gusts up to 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) and heavy rain which left 23 @,@ 000 houses without electricity . In all , the storm caused $ 200 @,@ 000 ( 2006 USD ; $ 235 thousand 2016 USD ) in damage . Florence then brought heavy rains across Newfoundland as an extratropical storm , destroying one house and causing minor damage to several others . There were no fatalities as a result of the hurricane . 
 = = = Hurricane Gordon = = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 1 . The wave tracked westward across the Atlantic for several days until it reached an area of relaxed wind shear and its associated low pressure area organized into a tropical depression . It moved east @-@ northeast and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gordon on September 11 , while located over the open waters of the Atlantic . Gordon turned north , and became a hurricane on September 13 . It intensified to Category 3 status on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane scale and reached its peak intensity of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) on September 14 . Tracking northward , it began to lose tropical characteristics . On September 20 , the system affected Britain with high winds and heavy rain as an extratropical cyclone . During Gordon 's passage through Britain , 120 @,@ 000 homes were left without power after winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) affected the country . 
 = = = Hurricane Helene = = = 
 On September 11 , a vigorous tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa . The wave organized rapidly and spawned a tropical depression to the south @-@ southeast of Cape Verde . On September 14 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Helene while tracking west @-@ northwest . Helene continued to intensify and was upgraded to a hurricane on September 16 . The storm began to execute a northward track , and reached Category 3 hurricane status on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane scale on September 18 , before reaching its peak intensity of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) . It started to weaken when it reached the cold waters of the North Atlantic , and Helene dissipated on September 20 , without having had major effects on land other than moderate wind gusts in the British Isles . 
 = = = Hurricane Isaac = = = 
 Hurricane Isaac originated in a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on September 18 . The wave tracked west , produced a tropical depression , and became a tropical storm on September 28 . Isaac moved north @-@ northwest and was upgraded to a hurricane on September 30 . It turned north and reached its peak intensity of 85 mph ( 135 km / h ) before weakening and brushing Nova Scotia . Isaac produced moderate winds on land in Newfoundland , peaking at 60 mph ( 96 km / h ) with a sustained wind of 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) was recorded .

 The Battle of Garnett 's and Golding 's Farms took place June 27 – 28 , 1862 , in Henrico County , Virginia , as part of the Seven Days Battles of the American Civil War 's Peninsula Campaign . While the battle at Gaines 's Mill raged north of the Chickahominy River , the forces of Confederate general John B. Magruder conducted a reconnaissance in force that developed into a minor attack against the Union line south of the river at Garnett 's Farm . The Confederates attacked again near Golding 's Farm on the morning of June 28 but in both cases were easily repulsed . The action at the Garnett and Golding farms accomplished little beyond convincing McClellan that he was being attacked from both sides of the Chickahominy .

In this context , General George McClellan and his Army of the Potomac began a campaign on the Virginia Peninsula to take the city . His early attempts were successful . In fact , on nearly every front , the Northerners had an advantage over the Confederates . By the end of May 1862 however , McClellan 's army was split in half along the banks of the Chickahominy River , with one wing , encompassing two Union corps , to the south river , and the other wing , with some three Federal corps , to the north . On May 31 , Joseph E. Johnston , the general @-@ in @-@ chief of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia , sought to capitalize on the bifurcation and led three columns of soldiers towards the Union position at the south of the river . The resulting conflict , called the Battle of Seven Pines ( or Fair Oaks ) , was inconclusive . Johnston 's plan fell apart , and the Army of the Potomac lost no ground . Johnston himself was wounded however , and the next day , June 1 , Jefferson Davis , the President of the Confederate States , appointed his military adviser , General Robert E. Lee , to lead the Confederate armies . There was a lull in the fighting on the Peninsula in subsequent weeks , ending in a Union offensive at Oak Grove on June 25 . Lee 's men managed to halt the attacking Federals , and the next day , the Confederates went on the offensive in the Battle of Mechanicsville ( or Beaver Dam Creek ) . The battle ended in a Confederate repulse and heavy Southern casualties . Nevertheless , the victorious Federals , under General McClellan 's orders , retreated to Boatswain 's Swamp at the south Chickahominy and established a formidable battle line . There , on June 27 , the Confederate armies launched an attack at Gaines 's Mill , which would become one of the bloodiest battles of the Peninsula Campaign . While the conflict at Gaines 's Mill raged , another conflict was brewing near two farms to the south , which would turn into the Battle of Garnett 's and Golding 's Farm .

 James M. Garnett 's farm , near Old Tavern , was situated on the edge of the bluffs at the banks of the Chickahominy River . Near the Garnett farm was Golding 's Plain , belonging to Simon <unk> . Between the two farms was a precipitous ravine , a creek and a hill named Garnett 's Hill . Union soldiers from Brigadier General William T. H. Brooks 's brigade of William F. " Baldy " Smith 's VI Corps began placing artillery pieces on Garnett 's Hill the night before the battle . This activity was resumed by Brigadier General Winfield Scott Hancock 's brigade of the same Corps the following morning – June 27 , 1862 . Six batteries of reserve artillery were placed . 
 While the Federals worked , Confederate soldiers of Major General David R. Jones 's division began taking up positions in the area . Brigadier General Robert Toombs 's brigade positioned themselves at the west side of the ravine , while Colonel George T. Anderson 's brigade took up a position northwest of the area , less than a mile from the Garnett house . Anderson 's and Toombs 's artillerists were ordered to fire on the Union soldiers whenever the opportunity presented itself . The Federals , now preparing for a general engagement , were told to avoid a clash with the Confederates . The result was a brisk shelling that lasted about an hour , and ended in a Confederate withdrawal . The Union 's twenty @-@ three , well @-@ positioned guns withstood the Confederates 's ten guns , which were situated in an open field . Later , some of Major General Lafayette McLaws 's men advanced towards the Union line at the Garnett farm at about 4 pm , but withdrew after ten minutes under heavy fire . There was a lull in the subsequent hours , ending with Toombs 's attack on the Union line at about 7 pm . Toombs was ordered to reconnoiter or " feel the enemy " . Instead , he engaged the Federals in a " sharp and sustained fight " . After nightfall , Toombs 's advance was repelled by Winfield Hancock 's brigade after about an hour and a half of fighting . The Confederates suffered some 271 casualties during the day 's conflict . The action at the Garnett farm accomplished little . 
 The following day , June 28 , Union and Confederate soldiers clashed again near the Golding house . Jones suspected that the Federals near the house were withdrawing , and authorized Toombs to perform a reconnaissance @-@ in @-@ force to ascertain whether this was true . However , Toombs turned the reconnaissance operation into a full engagement and advanced with some of Anderson 's men . Before he could be countermanded , the Confederates had already been repulsed by the VI Corps . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In the two days of fighting at the Garnett and Golding farms , the Confederates suffered 438 casualties , while the Federals suffered 189 . Anderson 's men , who bore the brunt of the Federal counterattack , suffered 156 casualties on the second day of fighting . This battle accomplished little , but helped to convince McClellan that he was being attacked from both sides of the Chickahominy . On the evening of June 28 , McClellan convened a meeting with his generals . He announced that he was willing to pursue an attack on Richmond , but such an attack could spell the defeat and destruction of the Army of the Potomac . The result of the meeting was that the Federals would begin a retreat . " The commanding general announced to us his purpose to begin a movement to the James River on the next day , " noted Union general William B. Franklin . McClellan 's decision to withdraw to the James set the stage for the subsequent Battle of Savage 's Station . 
 = The Boat Race 1925 = 
 The 77th Boat Race took place on 28 March 1925 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . Umpired by former rower Frederick I. Pitman , Cambridge won in a time of 21 minutes 50 seconds as Oxford were waterlogged and unable to finish the race . The victory took the overall record in the event to 40 – 36 in Oxford 's favour . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1924 race by four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths , while Oxford led overall with 40 victories to Cambridge 's 35 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Oxford were coached by G. C. Bourne who had rowed for the university in the 1882 and 1883 races , Stanley Garton ( who had rowed three times between 1909 and 1911 ) and E. D. Horsfall ( who had rowed in the three races prior to the First World War ) . Cambridge 's coaches were Francis Escombe , P. Haig @-@ Thomas ( four @-@ time Blue who had rowed between 1902 and 1905 ) , Sir Henry Howard ( coach of the Lady Margaret Boat Club ) and David Alexander Wauchope ( who had rowed in the 1895 race ) . For the seventeenth year the umpire was Old Etonian Frederick I. Pitman who had rowed for Cambridge in the 1884 , 1885 and 1886 races . 
 As a result of various illnesses , the Oxford crew was not finalised until five days before the race , and according to former Dark Blue rower and author George Drinkwater , " the innumerable changes prevented the crew from ever really getting together " . Drinkwater also stated that the Oxford boat rowed with " three unfit men in the boat " . Similarly , Cambridge were affected by illness , in particular the boat club president Robert Morrison who was forced to leave the crew . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 0 @.@ 875 lb ( 78 @.@ 5 kg ) , 0 @.@ 375 pounds ( 0 @.@ 2 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . Cambridge 's crew included six participants with Boat Race experience , all of whom had made their first appearance in the event the previous year . Oxford saw three rowers return to the boat , including G. J. Mower @-@ White who was rowing in his third consecutive race . All of the participants in the race were registered as British . 
 = = Race = = 
 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station , handing the Surrey side of the river to Oxford . Pitman got the race underway at 3 : 41 p.m. in a strong wind diagonally across the start which made the Surrey virtually unnavigable ; within a minute , the Dark Blues ' boat was waterlogged . Cambridge enjoyed the shelter of the Middlesex wall and rapidly went away . Despite being advised to stop by their coach Garton , it was not until The Doves pub that Oxford gave up . Cambridge slowed to a " strong paddle " and passed the finishing post in a time of 21 minutes 50 seconds . 
 It was the slowest winning time since the 1912 race and the third time in the history of the event that one or both of the crews sank ( in the 1859 and 1912 races ) . According to author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater , the race was " a complete ' washout ' in the literal sense of the word " . Following the race , Pitman was heavily criticised for his placement of the <unk> ; Drinkwater disagreed , noting that " when the take @-@ boats were being placed ... the water was possible for both boats . " Indeed , prior to the race he had followed the requests of both boat club presidents to move the boats closer to the Middlesex station but did not want to give an inappropriate advantage to the crew starting from that side of the river . In a letter from Pitman , published in The Field , he wrote that " I hope that the umpire may be relieved from the duty of fixing the course , or that he may have the assistance of a representative of both Universities on his launch in fixing the stake @-@ boats and deciding whether the race can be rowed .

 = Diabetes mellitus type 2 = 
 Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a long term metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood sugar , insulin resistance , and relative lack of insulin . Common symptoms include increased thirst , frequent urination , and unexplained weight loss . Symptoms may also include increased hunger , feeling tired , and sores that do not heal . Often symptoms come on slowly . Long @-@ term complications from high blood sugar include heart disease , strokes , diabetic retinopathy which can result in blindness , kidney failure , and poor blood flow in the limbs which may lead to amputations . The sudden onset of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state may occur ; however , ketoacidosis is uncommon . 
 Type 2 diabetes primarily occurs as a result of obesity and not enough exercise . Some people are more genetically at risk than others . Type 2 diabetes makes up about 90 % of cases of diabetes , with the other 10 % due primarily to diabetes mellitus type 1 and gestational diabetes . In diabetes mellitus type 1 there is an absolute lack of insulin due to breakdown of islet cells in the pancreas . Diagnosis of diabetes is by blood tests such as fasting plasma glucose , oral glucose tolerance test , or <unk> . 
 Type 2 diabetes is partly preventable by staying a normal weight , exercising regularly , and eating properly . Treatment involves exercise and dietary changes . If blood sugar levels are not adequately lowered , the medication metformin is typically recommended . Many people may eventually also require insulin injections . In those on insulin , routinely check blood sugar levels is advised , however this may not be needed in those taking pills . Bariatric surgery often improves diabetes in those who are obese . 
 Rates of type 2 diabetes have increased markedly since 1960 in parallel with obesity . As of 2013 there were approximately 368 million people diagnosed with the disease compared to around 30 million in 1985 . Typically it begins in middle or older age , although rates of type 2 diabetes are increasing in young people . Type 2 diabetes is associated with a ten @-@ year @-@ shorter life expectancy . Diabetes was one of the first diseases described . The importance of insulin in the disease was determined in the 1920s . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 The classic symptoms of diabetes are polyuria ( frequent urination ) , polydipsia ( increased thirst ) , polyphagia ( increased hunger ) , and weight loss . Other symptoms that are commonly present at diagnosis include a history of blurred vision , itchiness , peripheral neuropathy , recurrent vaginal infections , and fatigue . Many people , however , have no symptoms during the first few years and are diagnosed on routine testing . People with type 2 diabetes mellitus may rarely present with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state ( a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and low blood pressure ) . 
 = = = Complications = = = 
 Type 2 diabetes is typically a chronic disease associated with a ten @-@ year @-@ shorter life expectancy . This is partly due to a number of complications with which it is associated , including : two to four times the risk of cardiovascular disease , including ischemic heart disease and stroke ; a 20 @-@ fold increase in lower limb amputations , and increased rates of hospitalizations . In the developed world , and increasingly elsewhere , type 2 diabetes is the largest cause of nontraumatic blindness and kidney failure . It has also been associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia through disease processes such as Alzheimer 's disease and vascular dementia . Other complications include <unk> nigricans , sexual dysfunction , and frequent infections . 
 = = Cause = = 
 The development of type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors . While some of these factors are under personal control , such as diet and obesity , other factors are not , such as increasing age , female gender , and genetics . A lack of sleep has been linked to type 2 diabetes . This is believed to act through its effect on metabolism . The nutritional status of a mother during fetal development may also play a role , with one proposed mechanism being that of altered DNA methylation . The intestinal <unk> <unk> <unk> and Bacteroides <unk> have been connected with type 2 diabetes . 
 = = = Lifestyle = = = 
 A number of lifestyle factors are known to be important to the development of type 2 diabetes , including obesity and being overweight ( defined by a body mass index of greater than 25 ) , lack of physical activity , poor diet , stress , and urbanization . Excess body fat is associated with 30 % of cases in those of Chinese and Japanese descent , 60 – 80 % of cases in those of European and African descent , and 100 % of cases in Pima Indians and Pacific Islanders . Those who are not obese often have a high waist – hip ratio . Smoking also appears to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus . 
 Dietary factors also influence the risk of developing type 2 diabetes . Consumption of sugar @-@ sweetened drinks in excess is associated with an increased risk . The type of fats in the diet are also important , with saturated fats and trans fatty acids increasing the risk , and polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat decreasing the risk . Eating lots of white rice appears to also play a role in increasing risk . A lack of exercise is believed to cause 7 % of cases . Persistent organic pollutants may also play a role . 
 = = = Genetics = = = 
 Most cases of diabetes involve many genes , with each being a small contributor to an increased probability of becoming a type 2 diabetic . If one identical twin has diabetes , the chance of the other developing diabetes within his lifetime is greater than 90 % , while the rate for nonidentical siblings is 25 – 50 % . As of 2011 , more than 36 genes had been found that contribute to the risk of type 2 diabetes . All of these genes together still only account for 10 % of the total heritable component of the disease . The <unk> allele , for example , increases the risk of developing diabetes by 1 @.@ 5 times and is the greatest risk of the common genetic variants . Most of the genes linked to diabetes are involved in beta cell functions . 
 There are a number of rare cases of diabetes that arise due to an abnormality in a single gene ( known as <unk> forms of diabetes or " other specific types of diabetes " ) . These include maturity onset diabetes of the young ( <unk> ) , Donohue syndrome , and Rabson @-@ Mendenhall syndrome , among others . Maturity onset diabetes of the young constitute 1 – 5 % of all cases of diabetes in young people . 
 = = = Medical conditions = = = 
 There are a number of medications and other health problems that can predispose to diabetes . Some of the medications include : glucocorticoids , thiazides , beta blockers , atypical antipsychotics , and statins . Those who have previously had gestational diabetes are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes . Other health problems that are associated include : acromegaly , Cushing 's syndrome , hyperthyroidism , pheochromocytoma , and certain cancers such as <unk> . Testosterone deficiency is also associated with type 2 diabetes . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 Type 2 diabetes is due to insufficient insulin production from beta cells in the setting of insulin resistance . Insulin resistance , which is the inability of cells to respond adequately to normal levels of insulin , occurs primarily within the muscles , liver , and fat tissue . In the liver , insulin normally suppresses glucose release . However , in the setting of insulin resistance , the liver inappropriately releases glucose into the blood . The proportion of insulin resistance versus beta cell dysfunction differs among individuals , with some having primarily insulin resistance and only a minor defect in insulin secretion and others with slight insulin resistance and primarily a lack of insulin secretion . 
 Other potentially important mechanisms associated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance include : increased breakdown of lipids within fat cells , resistance to and lack of <unk> , high glucagon levels in the blood , increased retention of salt and water by the kidneys , and inappropriate regulation of metabolism by the central nervous system . However , not all people with insulin resistance develop diabetes , since an impairment of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells is also required . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 The World Health Organization definition of diabetes ( both type 1 and type 2 ) is for a single raised glucose reading with symptoms , otherwise raised values on two occasions , of either : 
 fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7 @.@ 0 mmol / l ( 126 mg / dl ) 
 or 
 with a glucose tolerance test , two hours after the oral dose a plasma glucose ≥ 11 @.@ 1 mmol / l ( 200 mg / dl ) 
 A random blood sugar of greater than 11 @.@ 1 mmol / l ( 200 mg / dL ) in association with typical symptoms or a <unk> hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) of ≥ 48 mmol / mol ( ≥ 6 @.@ 5 <unk> % ) is another method of diagnosing diabetes . In 2009 an International Expert Committee that included representatives of the American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) , the International Diabetes Federation ( IDF ) , and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes ( <unk> ) recommended that a threshold of ≥ 48 mmol / mol ( ≥ 6 @.@ 5 <unk> % ) should be used to diagnose diabetes . This recommendation was adopted by the American Diabetes Association in 2010 . Positive tests should be repeated unless the person presents with typical symptoms and blood sugars > 11 @.@ 1 mmol / l ( > 200 mg / dl ) . 
 Threshold for diagnosis of diabetes is based on the relationship between results of glucose tolerance tests , fasting glucose or HbA1c and complications such as retinal problems . A fasting or random blood sugar is preferred over the glucose tolerance test , as they are more convenient for people . HbA1c has the advantages that fasting is not required and results are more stable but has the disadvantage that the test is more costly than measurement of blood glucose . It is estimated that 20 % of people with diabetes in the United States do not realize that they have the disease . 
 Diabetes mellitus type 2 is characterized by high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency . This is in contrast to diabetes mellitus type 1 in which there is an absolute insulin deficiency due to destruction of [ islet cells in the pancreas and gestational diabetes mellitus that is a new onset of high blood sugars associated with pregnancy . Type 1 and type 2 diabetes can typically be distinguished based on the presenting circumstances . If the diagnosis is in doubt antibody testing may be useful to confirm type 1 diabetes and C @-@ peptide levels may be useful to confirm type 2 diabetes , with C @-@ peptide levels normal or high in type 2 diabetes , but low in type 1 diabetes . 
 = = Screening = = 
 No major organization recommends universal screening for diabetes as there is no evidence that such a program improve outcomes . Screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) in adults without symptoms whose blood pressure is greater than 135 / 80 mmHg . For those whose blood pressure is less , the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against screening . There is no evidence that it changes the risk of death in this group of people . They also recommend screening among those who are overweight and between the ages of 40 and 70 . 
 The World Health Organization recommends testing those groups at high risk and in 2014 the USPSTF is considering a similar recommendation . High @-@ risk groups in the United States include : those over 45 years old ; those with a first degree relative with diabetes ; some ethnic groups , including Hispanics , African @-@ Americans , and Native @-@ Americans ; a history of gestational diabetes ; polycystic ovary syndrome ; excess weight ; and conditions associated with metabolic syndrome . The American Diabetes Association recommends screening those who have a BMI over 25 ( in people of Asian descent screening is recommending for a BMI over 23 . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 Onset of type 2 diabetes can be delayed or prevented through proper nutrition and regular exercise . Intensive lifestyle measures may reduce the risk by over half . The benefit of exercise occurs regardless of the person 's initial weight or subsequent weight loss . Evidence for the benefit of dietary changes alone , however , is limited , with some evidence for a diet high in green leafy vegetables and some for limiting the intake of sugary drinks . In those with impaired glucose tolerance , diet and exercise either alone or in combination with metformin or <unk> may decrease the risk of developing diabetes . Lifestyle interventions are more effective than metformin . While low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of diabetes , correcting the levels by supplementing vitamin D3 does not improve that risk . 
 = = Management = = 
 Management of type 2 diabetes focuses on lifestyle interventions , lowering other cardiovascular risk factors , and maintaining blood glucose levels in the normal range . Self @-@ monitoring of blood glucose for people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes may be used in combination with education , however the benefit of self monitoring in those not using multi @-@ dose insulin is questionable . In those who do not want to measure blood levels , measuring urine levels may be done . Managing other cardiovascular risk factors , such as hypertension , high cholesterol , and <unk> , improves a person 's life expectancy . Decreasing the systolic blood pressure to less than 140 mmHg is associated with a lower risk of death and better outcomes . Intensive blood pressure management ( less than 130 / 80 mmHg ) as opposed to standard blood pressure management ( less than 140 / 85 – 100 mmHg ) results in a slight decrease in stroke risk but no effect on overall risk of death . 
 Intensive blood sugar lowering ( HbA1c < 6 % ) as opposed to standard blood sugar lowering ( HbA1c of 7 – 7 @.@ 9 % ) does not appear to change mortality . The goal of treatment is typically an HbA1c of around 7 % or a fasting glucose of less than 7 @.@ 2 mmol / L ( 130 mg / dL ) ; however these goals may be changed after professional clinical consultation , taking into account particular risks of hypoglycemia and life expectancy . It is recommended that all people with type 2 diabetes get regular ophthalmology examination . Treating gum disease in those with diabetes may result in a small improvement in blood sugar levels . 
 = = = Lifestyle = = = 
 A proper diet and exercise are the foundations of diabetic care , with a greater amount of exercise yielding better results . Aerobic exercise leads to a decrease in HbA1c and improved insulin sensitivity . Resistance training is also useful and the combination of both types of exercise may be most effective . A diabetic diet that promotes weight loss is important . While the best diet type to achieve this is controversial , a low glycemic index diet or low carbohydrate diet has been found to improve blood sugar control . Culturally appropriate education may help people with type 2 diabetes control their blood sugar levels , for up to six months at least . If changes in lifestyle in those with mild diabetes has not resulted in improved blood sugars within six weeks , medications should then be considered . There is not enough evidence to determine if lifestyle interventions affect mortality in those who already have <unk> . 
 = = = Medications = = = 
 There are several classes of anti @-@ diabetic medications available . Metformin is generally recommended as a first line treatment as there is some evidence that it decreases mortality ; however , this conclusion is questioned . Metformin should not be used in those with severe kidney or liver problems . 
 A second oral agent of another class or insulin may be added if metformin is not sufficient after three months . Other classes of medications include : sulfonylureas , <unk> , <unk> peptidase @-@ 4 inhibitors , <unk> inhibitors , and glucagon @-@ like peptide @-@ 1 analog . There is no significant difference between these agents . <unk> , a <unk> , has not been found to improve long @-@ term outcomes even though it improves blood sugar levels . Additionally it is associated with increased rates of heart disease and death . Angiotensin @-@ converting enzyme inhibitors ( <unk> ) prevent kidney disease and improve outcomes in those with diabetes . The similar medications angiotensin receptor blockers ( <unk> ) do not . A 2016 review recommended treating to a systolic blood pressure of 140 to 150 mmHg . 
 <unk> of insulin may either be added to oral medication or used alone . Most people do not initially need insulin . When it is used , a long @-@ acting formulation is typically added at night , with oral medications being continued . Doses are then increased to effect ( blood sugar levels being well controlled ) . When nightly insulin is insufficient , twice daily insulin may achieve better control . The long acting <unk> <unk> and <unk> are equally safe and effective , and do not appear much better than neutral <unk> Hagedorn ( NPH ) insulin , but as they are significantly more expensive , they are not cost effective as of 2010 . In those who are pregnant insulin is generally the treatment of choice . 
 = = = Surgery = = = 
 Weight loss surgery in those who are obese is an effective measure to treat diabetes . Many are able to maintain normal blood sugar levels with little or no medications following surgery and long @-@ term mortality is decreased . There however is some short @-@ term mortality risk of less than 1 % from the surgery . The body mass index cutoffs for when surgery is appropriate are not yet clear . It is recommended that this option be considered in those who are unable to get both their weight and blood sugar under control . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Globally as of 2010 it was estimated that there were 285 million people with type 2 diabetes making up about 90 % of diabetes cases . This is equivalent to about 6 % of the world 's adult population . Diabetes is common both in the developed and the developing world . It remains uncommon , however , in the underdeveloped world . 
 Women seem to be at a greater risk as do certain ethnic groups , such as South Asians , Pacific Islanders , Latinos , and Native Americans . This may be due to enhanced sensitivity to a Western lifestyle in certain ethnic groups . Traditionally considered a disease of adults , type 2 diabetes is increasingly diagnosed in children in parallel with rising obesity rates . Type 2 diabetes is now diagnosed as frequently as type 1 diabetes in teenagers in the United States . 
 Rates of diabetes in 1985 were estimated at 30 million , increasing to 135 million in 1995 and 217 million in 2005 . This increase is believed to be primarily due to the global population aging , a decrease in exercise , and increasing rates of obesity . The five countries with the greatest number of people with diabetes as of 2000 are India having 31 @.@ 7 million , China 20 @.@ 8 million , the United States 17 @.@ 7 million , Indonesia 8 @.@ 4 million , and Japan 6 @.@ 8 million . It is recognized as a global epidemic by the World Health Organization . 
 = = History = = 
 Diabetes is one of the first diseases described with an Egyptian manuscript from c . 1500 BCE mentioning " too great emptying of the urine . " The first described cases are believed to be of type 1 diabetes . Indian physicians around the same time identified the disease and classified it as <unk> or honey urine noting that the urine would attract ants . The term " diabetes " or " to pass through " was first used in 230 BCE by the Greek Apollonius Of Memphis . The disease was rare during the time of the Roman empire with Galen commenting that he had only seen two cases during his career . 
 Type 1 and type 2 diabetes were identified as separate conditions for the first time by the Indian physicians Sushruta and Charaka in 400 – 500 AD with type 1 associated with youth and type 2 with being overweight . The term " mellitus " or " from honey " was added by the Briton John Rolle in the late 1700s to separate the condition from diabetes insipidus which is also associated with frequent urination . Effective treatment was not developed until the early part of the 20th century when the Canadians Frederick Banting and Charles Best discovered insulin in 1921 and 1922 . This was followed by the development of the long acting NPH insulin in the 1940s . 
 = ARA Rivadavia = 
 ARA Rivadavia was an Argentine battleship built during the South American dreadnought race . Named after the first Argentine president , Bernardino Rivadavia , it was the lead ship of its class . Moreno was Rivadavia 's only sister ship . 
 In 1907 , the Brazilian government placed an order for two of the powerful new " dreadnought " warships as part of a larger naval construction program . Argentina quickly responded , as the Brazilian ships outclassed anything in the Argentine fleet . After an extended bidding process , contracts to design and build Rivadavia and Moreno were given to the American Fore River Shipbuilding Company . During their construction , there were rumors that the ships might be sold to a country engaged in the First World War , but both were commissioned into the Argentine Navy . Rivadavia underwent extensive refits in the United States in 1924 and 1925 . The ship saw no active service during the Second World War , and its last cruise was made in 1946 . Stricken from the naval register in 1957 , Rivadavia was sold later that year and broken up for scrap starting in 1959 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Rivadavia 's genesis can be traced to the naval arms races between Chile and Argentina which were spawned by territorial disputes over their mutual borders in Patagonia and Puna de Atacama , along with control of the Beagle Channel . These arms races flared up in the 1890s and again in 1902 ; the latter was eventually stopped through British mediation . Provisions in the dispute @-@ ending treaty imposed restrictions on both countries ' navies . The United Kingdom 's Royal Navy bought the two Constitución @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships that were being built for Chile , and Argentina sold its two Rivadavia @-@ class armored cruisers under construction in Italy to Japan . 
 After HMS Dreadnought was commissioned by the United Kingdom , Brazil decided in early 1907 to halt the construction of three obsolescent pre @-@ dreadnoughts and begin work on two dreadnoughts ( the Minas Geraes class ) . These ships , which were designed to carry the heaviest battleship armament in the world at the time , came as a shock to the navies of South America , and Argentina and Chile quickly canceled the 1902 armament @-@ limiting pact . Argentina in particular was alarmed at the possible power of the ships . The Minister of Foreign Affairs , Manuel Augusto Montes de Oca , remarked that even one Minas Geraes @-@ class ship could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets . While this may have been hyperbole , either one was much more powerful than any single vessel in the Argentinian fleet . Debates raged in Argentina over whether to spend more than two million pounds sterling to acquire dreadnoughts . With further border disputes , particularly with Brazil near the Río de la Plata ( River Plate ) , Argentina made plans to contract for their own dreadnoughts . After an extended bidding process , Rivadavia and Moreno were ordered from the Fore River Shipbuilding Company in the United States . 
 = = Construction and trials = = 
 Laid down on 25 May 1910 , Rivadavia was launched and christened on 26 August 1911 by Isabel , the wife of the Argentine Minister to the United States Rómulo Sebastián <unk> . Thousands of people were present to witness the event , including representatives from the Argentine Navy and the country 's legation in Washington . The United States sent the assistant chief of the Latin American Division in the State Department , Henry L. James , to be its official representative . Two United States Navy bureau chiefs also attended . 
 In mid @-@ September 1913 , Rivadavia conducted trials off Rockland , Maine , after a two @-@ week delay due to turbine malfunctions . During speed trials on the 16th , the dreadnought was able to obtain a maximum speed of 22 @.@ 567 knots ( 25 @.@ 970 mph ; 41 @.@ 794 km / h ) . On a 30 @-@ hour endurance trial starting the next day , Rivadavia damaged one of its turbines and had to put in at President Roads , one of Boston Harbor 's deep @-@ water anchorages .

 Over the course of their construction , Rivadavia and Moreno had been the subject of rumors that Argentina would accept the ships and then sell them to Japan , a fast @-@ growing military rival to the United States , or to a European country . The rumors were partially true ; some in the government were looking to get rid of the battleships and devote the proceeds to opening more schools , and The New York Times reported in late 1913 that the country had received several offers from interested parties . This angered the American government , which did not want its warship technology offered to the highest bidder . Neither did they want to exercise a contract @-@ specified option that gave the United States first choice if the Argentines decided to sell , as naval technology had already progressed past the Rivadavia class , particularly in the adoption of the " all @-@ or @-@ nothing " armor scheme . Instead , the United States and its State Department and Navy Department put diplomatic pressure on the Argentine government . 
 After socialist gains in the legislature , the Argentine government introduced several bills in May 1914 which would have put the battleships up for sale , but they were all defeated by late June . Following the commencement of the First World War , the German and British ambassadors to the United States both complained to the US State Department ; the former believed that the British were going to be given the ships as soon as the ships reached Argentina , and the latter considered it the responsibility of the United States to ensure that the ships never left Argentina 's possession . International armament companies attempted to get Argentina to sell to one of the smaller Balkan countries and expected that the ships would then find their way into the war .

 Rivadavia was commissioned into the Armada de la República Argentina on 27 August 1914 at the Charlestown Navy Yard , although it was not fully completed until December . On 23 December 1914 , Rivadavia left the United States for Argentina . It arrived in its capital , Buenos Aires , on 19 February 1915 . Over 47 @,@ 000 people came out to see the new ship over the next three days , including the President Victorino de la Plaza . In April 1915 , Rivadavia was put into the training division of the Navy , remaining there until 1917 , when the navy transferred the ship into the First Division . In 1917 , Rivadavia sailed to Comodoro Rivadavia when communist oil workers went on strike . 
 Later in 1917 , the Argentines had to sharply curtail Rivadavia 's activities because of a fuel shortage , but they voyaged to the United States with the Argentine ambassador in 1918 . Rivadavia then took on a load of gold bullion and brought it back to Argentina , docking in Puerto Belgrano on 23 September 1918 . In December 1920 , Rivadavia participated in ceremonies that marked the 400th anniversary of the discovery of the Strait of Magellan . On the 2nd , the ship called on Valparaíso in Chile ; 25 days later , it took part in an international naval review . Two years later , Rivadavia was placed into reserve . 
 In 1923 , the Navy decided to send Rivadavia to the United States to be modernized . The ship departed on 6 August 1924 and reached Boston on the 30th , where it spent the next two years . Rivadavia was converted to use fuel oil instead of coal and had " a general machinery overhaul " . A new fire @-@ control system was fitted with rangefinders on the fore and aft superfiring turrets , and the aft mast was replaced by a tripod . A funnel cap was installed so that smoke from the funnels did not interfere with accurate rangefinding of enemy ships . The 6 @-@ inch secondary armament was retained , but the smaller 4 @-@ inch guns were taken off in favor of four 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) anti @-@ aircraft guns and four 3 @-@ pounders . 
 After sailing back to Argentina in March and April 1926 , Rivadavia spent the remainder of the year undergoing sea trials . The dreadnought joined the training division once again in 1927 , but after Rivadavia made four training cruises , the division was disbanded , and the ship remained moored in Puerto Belgrano until 1929 . This began a series of cyclic activity followed by being demoted to the reserve fleet . Although active in both 1929 and 1930 , Rivadavia was placed in reserve on 19 December 1930 . Shortly thereafter , it was restored to active service to serve as the flagship for 1931 fleet exercises . Rivadavia went back into reserve in 1932 before coming back out in January 1933 . It remained in full commission for most of the rest of the decade as part of the Battleship Division , alongside Moreno . 
 In January 1937 , the ship called on Valparaíso and Callao in Peru . In company with Moreno , Rivadavia left Puerto Belgrano for Europe on 6 April . After crossing the ocean , they split up , with Rivadavia mooring at the French port of Brest while Moreno took part in the British Coronation Review in Spithead . The two ships then journeyed to several German ports : both put in at Wilhelmshaven before Rivadavia went to Hamburg and Moreno to Bremen . They returned to Argentina on 29 June . 
 While Rivadavia made an official visit to Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , in 1939 , Argentina remained neutral for the majority of the Second World War , and the aging dreadnought saw no active service . Its next cruise came after the war ended ( 29 October to 22 December 1946 ) , when it called on countries in the Caribbean and northern South America , including Trinidad , Venezuela , and Colombia . This was the last time the ship would be in service under its own power . Moored in Puerto Belgrano from 1948 on , the ship was rendered inoperable in 1951 and cannibalized for many years for useful arms and equipment . On 18 October 1956 , the ship was listed for disposal , and it was stricken from the Navy on 1 February 1957 . On 30 May , Rivadavia was sold to an Italian ship breaking company for US $ 2 @,@ 280 @,@ 000 . Beginning on 3 April 1959 , the ship was towed by two tugboats to Savona , Italy , where they arrived on 23 May . It was thereafter broken up in Genoa .

Having lived in less affluent areas prior to the move , Black found that she did not fit in with her privileged classmates , becoming an outcast . Her father died when she was sixteen . Black had taken part in national competitive dancing , taking jazz , hip @-@ hop , tap , and ballet lessons , since she was young , and , at one point , was training to perform on Broadway . She also considered becoming a backup dancer . After being expelled from her last school , Black ran away from home . She started begging , doing drugs , and drinking while crashing at friends ' houses at night . After going on tour with Armor for Sleep , she returned to Detroit and stopped taking drugs .

 While on a road trip in New York , Black was approached by her first manager who told her to look for him in Los Angeles when she turned 18 . Eighteen months later , Black moved to Los Angeles , found her manager and was signed to Virgin Records two weeks later . Recording under the pseudonym Porcelain and the Tramps , Black worked with Tommy Henriksen and John Lowery in London while at Virgin . However , she and the label could not agree on the music she made . Virgin wanted Black to record pop music in the vein of Avril Lavigne , despite already knowing what kind of music she made when signing her . She also faced skepticism from her collaborators who questioned her desire to mix industrial rock sounds with dance pop . Black began posting the songs she recorded on Myspace , gaining upwards of 10 million views in a matter of months . Black co @-@ wrote and sang backup vocals for the song " Lunacy Fringe " by The Used . She was approached by Courtney Love on MySpace to provide backing vocals for a solo album she was working on . She also was featured on a song by the Street Drum Corps 's " Action ! " . " How Do You Love Someone ? " , co @-@ penned by Black , Billy Steinberg , and Josh Alexander around the time Black left Virgin , was recorded by Ashley Tisdale for her second album , Guilty Pleasure . Black was initially reluctant to give the song away , but relented and later got to record the song for her own album with production from RedOne .

 Through a mutual A & R friend , producer RedOne heard about Black and was interested in meeting her . RedOne asked to meet Black in his studio in November 2009 , which led to them writing her debut single " This Is What Rock n ' Roll Looks Like " the next day . RedOne helped Black get out of her contract with Virgin Records and signed her to his Universal Republic imprint , 2101 Records . RedOne also introduced her to a new manager , Derrick " EI " Lawrence , who also manages Lil Wayne . Wayne invited her to join him on his I Am Music Tour after meeting her . She changed her name to Porcelain Black because it caused confusion to people who thought Porcelain and the Tramps was a band . Her stage name came from her childhood nickname , Porcelain , which was due to an extensive collection of porcelain dolls given to her by her aunt . Her aunt thought that the dolls resembled her in appearance , with strawberry blond hair and pale skin . She adopted Black in her name because she felt that it represented the opposite of " fragile " Porcelain . She made plans to revisit the Porcelain and the Tramps project in the future . The songs " King of the World " and " I 'm Your Favorite Drug " were remastered for her debut album . Black co @-@ wrote " Lolita " for Mexican pop singer Belinda . She also made appearances in the music videos for Travie McCoy 's " We 'll Be Alright " , Swizz Beatz 's " Rock ' N ' Roll " and Jeffree Star 's " Get Away With Murder " in 2010 . Black had a cameo role in Rock of Ages with RedOne 's help , playing the lead singer of a 1980s glam metal band . Black sang one of the sole original songs for the film , " Rock Angels " . " Rock Angels " was written by Adam Anders and Desmond Child . Along with RedOne , Black composed " Save You Tonight " , the closing song for One Direction 's debut album , Up All Night . 
 Black appeared on Oxygen 's Best Ink , where the working title of her debut album was said to be Mannequin Factory . Challengers on the show were tasked with creating cover art for the album in a style that Porcelain Black termed " stripper couture " . The album has experienced numerous setbacks and rescheduled releases , and has not yet been released . Initially , RedOne was said to have produced and co @-@ wrote all but one of the tracks with her . However , Black later recorded songs with other producers after the album 's release date was pushed back . She made her television debut on the Late Show with David Letterman on July 21 , 2011 . After " This is What Rock and Roll Looks Like " , " Naughty Naughty " , the second single from her album , was released at the end of 2011 . " This Is What Rock n ' Roll Looks Like " was a modest hit on Billboard ' s Dance Club chart while the second single peaked at number 6 on the chart . Black featured in the song " DNA " for rapper Rye Rye 's debut album , Go ! Pop ! Bang ! . At some point succeeding the release of her singles , <unk> Records became an imprint of Capitol Records when Universal Republic went under , further delaying the release of any new material by the industrial songstress . 
 During the summer of 2013 , Porcelain Black performed a private gig in West Hollywood , featuring all new material . Of the songs performed , " Rich Boi " and " Mama Forgive Me " received critical commentary . Several months later , 2101 Records released five songs in five weeks , following 8 August 2013 . " Mama Forgive Me " was the first released . Her long anticipated debut album is expected to be released after the five week promotional period , with two brand new singles preceding it . After " Mama Forgive Me " , Porcelain performed three new songs , whose titles were : " Pretty Little Psycho " , " Rich Boi " , and " One Woman Army " respectively . Popjustice hosted the songs " Rich Boi " and " One Woman Army " as their weekly Big Songs . Peaking at number 14 on the French Singles Chart , " One Woman Army " crowned the iTunes chart after she performed the song on the radio station NRJ and at the Fête de la Musique on the French channel France 2 on 21 June 2014 , becoming her first number @-@ one hit . 
 Later that year , Black announced through French radio station , <unk> , that the album had no confirmed title , revealing she had considered the names Black Rainbow and Mannequin Factory , but that those titles might not make it to the album as she had recorded more songs . 
 Feuds erupted on social media when Porcelain Black 's record label released an updated version of Deadmau5 's " Arcadia " instrumental , featuring Porcelain Black 's vocals . The lyrical version was renamed " Sweeter " . Idolator , a music @-@ reporting website , called the track a " [ ... ] sizzling electronic kiss @-@ off with shady lyrics like " I bet the bitch you 're with in the club is dancing to this right now ! " Sounds like a surefire winner ? " Deadmau5 rejected the collaboration as copyright infringement , referencing a similar event involving one of his songs and pop singer , Neon Hitch , that occurred in 2011 .

 Black 's voice has been described as raspy , death growls often appearing in her music . In an interview with The Advocate , Black revealed that she has always had this talent and that it is something she has never practiced . RedOne , the producer who signed her to his label , says that Black 's voice and attitude reminded him of Joan Jett . He concluded that " [ s ] he can scream and do things with her voice that nobody can do . She is uncompromising in pursuing her own creative vision . She 's taking everything that 's old and making it futuristic and bringing rock and roll back in her own way . " Black styled her musical genre " horror @-@ pop " . It has been described as the love child between Marilyn Manson and Britney Spears , a fusion of dance @-@ pop and darker industrial themes . Black cites that Spears inspires her deep love for choreography , while Manson inspires the sound and attitude of her lyrics and performance style . 
 Recalling the songwriting style she used when she had collaborated with RedOne , Porcelain Black said she would enter the studio with an idea she had come up with on her own at the piano and play it for RedOne . At other times , RedOne would play a beat he had constructed for her , and she would listen to it and see what vibes emerged from hearing it . Usually , Porcelain Black creates a song title , then forges the song around that . She finds the most difficult songwriting process to be starting with melody , because making the syllables of her lyrics match the melody produces an effect that sounds forced and contrived . When working with RedOne , Porcelain Black said they would construct the melodies together , but all of the song lyrics were written exclusively by her ; RedOne did not contribute to her music lyrically while they were working together on her first attempt at a debut album . Lyrically , Porcelain Black writes all of her own songs . On the topic , she has said : " I write all my own stuff . I don 't understand artists that don ’ t write their own songs . I 'm thankful for artists like Britney , but I don ’ t understand how you can ’ t write your own music . It 's such a personal way of expressing yourself . " 
 = = = Public image = = = 
 Critics have noted that her sound is more pop than rock , but Black is militant at her rock and roll image , saying " ... I know I 'm rock n roll . " When asked about what it means to be rock and roll , she stated : 
 Genre @-@ wise , her sound has been called " industrial pop " , a fusion of pop and industrial metal . Her flashy and irreverent image has been compared to the work of many other artists . Often , comparisons are drawn between her and Lady Gaga , but she has also been compared to Joan Jett , Courtney Love , and Nicki Minaj . Black 's two @-@ tone hairstyle and fashion is inspired by both Manson and Spears as well , along with her desire to develop a persona in which a stable duality between " good " and " bad " exists . The former has gained her comparisons to the cartoon character Cruella de Vil . Black disavows the association as completely unfounded , specifically saying , " She 's a [ expletive ] cartoon . Are you serious ? " Black calls her fans " <unk> " , alluding to the tattoo on the inside of her middle finger . Malcolm Harris , writing for The Huffington Post , discovered Porcelain Black on the cover of <unk> and reacted to her image : 
 Following trends in music where women experiment with bisexuality , Black said she was an " equal opportunist " . Thematically , her music has been said to resonate with LGBT and adolescence , gaining her notoriety as a gay icon . On this subject , Black has said : 
 Popjustice writer Peter Robinson said Porcelain Black was one of pop music 's most confusingly styled artists , attributing the shift from her edgier , rock @-@ inspired look to one resembling Jennifer Lopez as an attempt by her team to make her image more marketable . Despite the appraisal , he critiqued her song " Rich Boi " as being influenced by rock icons , Def Leppard and Steve Miller Band . In another review , Robinson commented on another record called " One Woman Army " from Porcelain Black 's private Hollywood show . Stylistically in vein with Porcelain Black 's pop rock genre hybrid , " One Woman Army " contains rapping , which Robinson said was " completely ridiculous and we love it . " Blogging " What a chorus ! " , he called attention to the chorus , saying " ... haven 't we all at some point in our lives been on a battlefield like ' oh my God ' ? "

She has also mentioned Janet Jackson as a primary influence , saying " I love everything she does . " The first concert she attended was an AC / DC concert with her father .

 = = Plot = = 
 Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) is assigned six hours of counseling with Toby Flenderson ( Paul Lieberstein ) after he physically reprimanded his nephew Luke ( Evan Peters ) , but Michael refuses to speak to Toby . One hour into their session , Toby tells Michael that he will not fill in the official assessment form unless Michael talks to him , so Michael begins telling ridiculous stories . Toby then tries the common counseling method of playing games with the client to get them to open up more . The method works , and Michael opens up to Toby about his personal history and relationships with people ( he mentions seeing a baseball game with his stepfather where he was told that the team 's manager deserved respect and how he never forgot that ) , and Toby makes an important discovery that Michael needs to be liked . Michael realizes what is happening , gets angry at Toby , and denigrates his counseling ability . Toby gives up and gives Michael the official form , allowing him to fill it out however he wants . In his haste , Michael accidentally checks off on the form that he is severely depressed and homicidal . Gabe contacts Toby , confused by his extreme assessment of Michael . Although Michael initially blames Toby for the mishap , he turns his ire to Gabe Lewis ( Zach Woods ) , even making Toby laugh . Michael openly offers to return to the break room with Toby and " bang this out " . At the end of the episode , they are both talking and drawing pictures . 
 Meanwhile , Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) realizes that although she has her dream job of salesman , that she just might not be cut out for it after all since she makes few sales and very little money . A chance visit from a vendor gives her an idea to <unk> a promotion to office administrator , hopefully for some added income . She informs Gabe of her promotion " from a few months back " and tells him she has not been paid accordingly , to which Gabe promises her he will get the missing wages if she can get all of the department heads to sign off on it . While she is busy convincing everyone that she has become the new administrator , Gabe catches on that she might be lying , and confronts her about it . Using a strategy she learned from watching poker , she stands her ground against Gabe and becomes de facto office administrator . 
 Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) has decided to boycott the Steamtown Mall after a shop owner refuses to serve him , going so far as to cancel orders to businesses there . Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) and the rest of the office convince Dwight to get revenge on the shop owner by making Dwight appear to be high @-@ class , and then having him refuse to buy from the shop , a scheme the office references from the movie Pretty Woman . Using tips from the rest of the office to make himself appear more sophisticated , Dwight , with Jim and Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) , return to the shop . To their surprise , the shop owner immediately recognizes Dwight even in his new attire , and explains that they did not serve him before because they were intimidated by his blood @-@ soaked hands ( actually beet juice ) . Dwight , somewhat flustered from the truth of the situation being revealed to him , stumbles over his words before finally saying the line he had came all the way there to say , " You made a big mistake . Huge ! " , while waving his shopping bags . The group leaves somewhat embarrassed , but not before Dwight buys what he came for : a pewter wizard statuette holding a crystal ball . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Counseling " was written by B. J. Novak , a producer and screenwriter for the series who also portrays the character of Ryan Howard on the show . The entry was directed by Jeffrey Blitz , who had also directed the previous episode " Nepotism " . " Counseling " features Eric Zuckerman , Vincent Angelo and Michael Schur in guest appearances as a store teller , a vendor , and Mose Schrute , respectively . Evan Peters also appears as Luke Cooper in archival footage from the previous episode . With the seventh season of The Office being Carell 's last , the writers decided to divide the season into two distinct halves ; the first half would " celebrate Carell 's finale year and highlight different actors on the show " , whereas the second half would focus on his departure and the search for a new manager . As such , " Counseling " was one of the first episode of the season to specifically highlight other characters , in this case Lieberstein 's character , Toby . 
 The Season Seven DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode . Notable cut scenes include Stanley discussing boycotting <unk> , Dwight putting on his fancy clothing , Dwight getting his pipe from Creed , Kevin giving Dwight a tissue , extended footage of Michael 's counseling session , Michael discussing dogs , and extended footage of Dwight in the mall .

 At Dwight 's daycare , a poster for the American hip hop duo Insane Clown Posse is hung on the wall ; however , Dwight has scribbled out the words " Insane " and " Posse " to make it fit into the daycare . In the episode , Dwight 's subplot is inspired by as Julia Roberts 's character did in the film Pretty Woman . Dwight even attempts to use Roberts 's line , " Big mistake " , but instead renders it as " You made a big mistake . Huge ! " During Michael 's counseling session , he sardonically tells Toby that he was probed by ALF , the alien star of the eponymous television series . Michael and Toby later pass the time playing Connect Four . Darryl notes to Pam that he saw a TLC show about Kate Walsh 's home office , and he wants one similar .

 In its original American broadcast , " Counseling " was viewed by an estimated 7 @.@ 36 million viewers with a 3 @.@ 7 rating / 10 % share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 . This means that it was seen by 3 @.@ 7 percent of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds , and 10 percent of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds watching television at the time of the broadcast . This marked a decrease in a million viewers and a 14 percent decrease in the 18 – 49 demographic from the previous episode . The episode became the highest @-@ rated non @-@ sports related NBC program for the original week it aired and also became the twenty @-@ first most @-@ watched show for the week of broadcast among adults aged 18 – 49 . 
 Joel Keller of AOLTV called it a " vast improvement " from the previous episode " Nepotism " , because he felt that " everyone at Dunder @-@ Mifflin [ sic ] Scranton acted like themselves " . Keller called Toby and Michael 's counseling session " great " and enjoyed the way Toby was able to trick Michael . Kelly Gerlach of TV Equals enjoyed the episode and noted that it " felt like the earlier seasons " because " there wasn ’ t forced humor , nothing made me cringe in my seat because of bad writing , and the awkward situations were written specifically to be awkward . " In the end , she called the episode " decent " . 
 Alan Sepinwall of HitFix felt that the main story employed " one of the show 's most reliable running jokes " . Furthermore , he felt that Michael softening to Toby was an interesting element to the episode , and he wondered if " this was a one @-@ time thing , or if Michael 's treatment of Toby will be softened , even a little . " Sepinwall also felt that Pam 's story was the stronger of the two subplots , and felt that an office controlled by her would be interesting . Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four out of five stars and called it " pleasant " . While he noted that each of the three stories " weren 't flat out funny " , he wrote that they were all " enjoyable " . Furthermore , he positively commented on the main plot , noting that the Michael and Toby rivalry was fun . 
 Not all reviews were positive . Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " C " grade . While he enjoyed the main storyline revolving around Michael and Toby and felt that it " came together both comically and dramatically at the end of the day " , he felt the rest of the episode was " quite uneven " with elements that were " ridiculous " , such as how Pam attained her new job . McNutt 's largest complaint with the remainder of the episode was that neither ended in " a logical place " ; he felt Dwight 's plot featured a disconnect from the character , and that Pam 's story was " lazy " . 
 = Persecution of Zoroastrians = 
 Persecution of Zoroastrians is the religious persecution inflicted upon the followers of the Zoroastrian faith . The persecution of Zoroastrians occurred throughout its history . The discrimination and harassment began in the form of sparse violence and forced conversions . Muslims are recorded to have destroyed fire temples . Zoroastrians living under Muslim rule were required to pay a tax called Jizya . 
 Zoroastrian places of worship were desecrated , shrines were destroyed and mosques built in their place . Many libraries were burned and much cultural heritage was lost . Gradually there were increased number of laws regulating Zoroastrian behavior , limiting their ability to participate in society . Over time , persecution of Zoroastrians became more common and widespread , and the number of believers decreased significantly . 
 Many converted , some superficially , to escape the systematic abuse and discrimination by the law of the land . Once a Zoroastrian family converted to Islam , the children had to go to an Islamic school and learn Arabic and the teachings of the Quran and these children lost their Zoroastrian identity , although under the Samanids , who were Zoroastrian converts to Islam , the Persian language flourished . On occasion , the Zoroastrian clergy assisted Muslims against those who they deemed Zoroastrian heretics . 
 At other times , Zoroastrians persecuted other Zoroastrians , in what were deemed heretical Zoroastrian sects . According to <unk> , persecution is pivotal to Zoroastrians ' sense of identity , and as the Jewish communities cannot be understood without an appreciation of the reality of anti @-@ Semitism , so too the Zoroastrian experience of exclusion must be taken into account .

 Until the Arab invasion and subsequent Muslim conquest , in the mid 7th century Persia ( modern @-@ day Iran ) was a politically independent state , spanning from the Aegean Sea to the Indus River and dominated by a Zoroastrian majority . Zoroastrianism was the official state religion of four pre @-@ Islamic Persian empires , the last being the Sassanian empire that passed a decree solidifying this in 224 CE . The Arab invasion abruptly brought to an end the religious domination of Zoroastrianism in Persia and instituted Islam as the official religion of the state . 
 After the Muslim conquest of Persia , Zoroastrians were given dhimmi status and subjected to persecutions ; discrimination and harassment began in the form of sparse violence . Those paying Jizya were subjected to insults and humiliation by the tax collectors . Zoroastrians who were captured as slaves in wars were given their freedom if they converted to Islam . 
 Many fire temples , with their four axial arch openings , were usually turned into mosques simply by setting a mihrab ( prayer niche ) on the place of the arch nearest to qibla ( the direction of Mecca ) . Zoroastrian temples converted into mosques in such a manner could be found in Bukhara , as well as in and near <unk> and other Persian cities . Urban cities where Arab governors made their quarters were most vulnerable to such religious persecution , great fire temples were turned into mosques , and the citizens were forced to conform or flee . Many libraries were burnt and much cultural heritage was lost . 
 Gradually there were increased number of laws regulating Zoroastrian behavior , limiting their ability to participate in society , and made life difficult for the Zoroastrians in the hope that they would convert to Islam . Over time , persecution of Zoroastrians became more common and widespread , and the number of believers decreased significantly . Many converted , some superficially , to escape the systematic abuse and discrimination by the law of the land . Others accepted Islam because their employment in industrial and artisan work would , according to Zoroastrian dogma , make them impure as their work involved defiling fire . According to Thomas Walker Arnold , Muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenants to Zoroastrians , as there were many similarities between the faiths . According to Arnold , for the Persian , he would meet Ahura Mazda and Ahriman under the names of Allah and <unk> . 
 Once a Zoroastrian family converted to Islam , the children had to go to Muslim religion school and learn Arabic and the teachings of the Quran and these children lost their Zoroastrian identity . These factors continued to contribute to increasing rates of conversion from Zoroastrianism to Islam . A Persian scholar commented , “ Why so many had to die or suffer ? Because one side was determined to impose his religion upon the other who could not understand . " 
 = = = 642 CE to 10th Century = = = 
 In the 7th century CE Persia succumbed to the invading Arabs . With the death of Yazdegerd III , who was treacherously slain in that year after being defeated in battle , the <unk> line came to an end and the Zoroastrian faith , which had been the state religion for more than a thousand years , was deposed , and Islam took its place as the national religion of Persia . 
 In the following centuries , Zoroastrians faced much religious discrimination and persecution , harassments , as well as being identified as <unk> ( polluted ) and impure to Muslims , making them unfit to live alongside Muslims , and therefore forcing them to evacuate from cities and face major sanctions in all spheres of life . Zoroastrians have been subject to public humiliation through dress regulations , to being labeled as <unk> and to exclusion in the fields of society , education and work . 
 = = = = Rashidun Caliphs ( 642 – 661 CE ) = = = = 
 Under the first four Caliphs , Persia remained predominantly Zoroastrian . Zoroastrians were awarded the status of People of the Book or dhimmi status by the Caliph Umar , although some practices contrary to Islam were prohibited . 
 When the Persian capital of Ctesiphon in province of <unk> ( today known as Iraq ) fell to the Muslims during the Islamic conquest of Persia in 637 under the military command of Sa 'ad ibn Abi Waqqas during the caliphate of Umar , the palaces and their archives were burned . According to an account in <unk> al @-@ Tabari by Al @-@ Tabari , the Arab Commander Sa 'ad ibn Abi Waqqas wrote to Caliph Umar ibn al @-@ <unk> @-@ b asking what should be done with the books at Ctesiphon . Umar wrote back : " If the books contradict the Qur 'an , they are blasphemous . On the other hand , if they are in agreement , they are not needed , as for us Qur 'an is sufficient . " Thus , the huge library was destroyed and the books , the product of the generations of Persian scientists and scholars were thrown into fire or the Euphrates . Nearly 40 @,@ 000 captured Persian noblemen were taken as slaves and sold in Arabia . The Arabs called the Persians ' Ajam ' meaning foreign . The first voice of protest came from Piruz <unk> , an enslaved Persian artisan , who assassinated Umar . When the city of Estakhr in the south , a Zoroastrian religious center , put up stiff resistance against the Arab invaders , 40 @,@ 000 residents were slaughtered or hanged . 
 = = = = The Umayyads ( 661 – 750 CE ) = = = = 
 The Umayyads who ruled from Syria followed the Caliphs . The persecution increased in the 8th century , during the reign of the late Umayyad Caliphs , whose dynastic predecessors had conquered most of the last Zoroastrian state by 652 . Jizya tax was imposed upon Zoroastrians , and the official language of Persia became Arabic instead of the local Persian . In 741 , the Umayyads officially decreed that non @-@ Muslims be excluded from governmental positions . 
 The Iranian Muslims at this time started a new tradition , which made Islam appear as a partly Iranian religion . They pointed out that an Iranian , <unk> @-@ I @-@ Farsi had a great influence on Muhammad , the prophet . Another myth was created that Husayn , the son of the fourth Caliph had married a Sassanian princess , named Shahr @-@ Banu , the Lady of the Land , whose son became the fourth Muslim Imam ( and started the Shia branch of Islam ) . The Iranian Muslims thus believed that Shia Islam was derived from Sassanian Royalty . These two beliefs made it easier for Zoroastrians to convert . An instance of religious oppression is recorded when an Arab governor appointed a commissioner to supervise the destruction of shrines throughout Iran , regardless of treaty obligations . One of the Umayyad Caliphs was quoted saying , " milk the Persians and once their milk dries , suck their blood " . 
 Yazid @-@ ibn @-@ <unk> , a general under the Umayyads , was appointed the head of a great army to lead the Mazandaran expedition . On the way to Mazandaran , the general ordered captives to be hanged at the two sides of the road so that the victorious Arab army pass through . The attack on <unk> ( present @-@ day Mazandaran ) failed , but he established his control in Gorgan . By the orders of Yazid @-@ ibn @-@ <unk> so many Persians were beheaded in Gorgan that their blood mixed with water would energize the millstone to produce as much as one day meal for him , as he had vowed . Extent of his brutality represented itself by running watermills by people 's blood for three days and he fed his army with the bread made from that very bloody flour . But , <unk> remained invincible until the majority of Zoroastrians migrated towards India and the rest converted to Islam gradually . 
 = = = = The Abbasids ( 752 – 804 CE ) = = = = 
 The Umayyads were followed by the Abbasid dynasty which came to power with the help of Iranian Muslims . The persecution of Zoroastrians increased significantly under the Abbasids , temples and sacred @-@ fire shrines were destroyed . Also during Abbasid rule , the status of Zoroastrians in Persian lands was reduced from <unk> ( or dhimmi , people who were protected by the state and generally considered ' People of the Book ' ) to ' <unk> ' ( non @-@ believers ) . As a result , Zoroastrians were not granted the same rights and status as Jews and Christians . Iranian Muslims were welcomed to the court , but not Zoroastrians . Zoroastrians were denied access to bathhouses on the grounds that their bodies were polluted . 
 Hardly any Zoroastrian family was able to avoid conversion to Islam when employed by the Abbasids . Because of their harshness towards unbelievers , and due to their lavish patronage of Persian Muslims , the Abbasids proved to be deadly foes of Zoroastrianism . According to <unk> , <unk> @-@ ibn @-@ Tahir , an Arabicized Persian , and governor of Khorasan for the Abbasid caliphs , banned publication in Persian and by his order all the Zoroastrians were forced to bring their religious books to be thrown in the fire . As a result , many literary works written in Pahlavi script disappeared . During the Abbasid reign the Zoroastrians , for the first time became a minority in Iran . Nevertheless , there were instances of toleration during the Abbasid era , particularly under the reign of Al @-@ Mu 'tasim who flogged an imam and muezzin for destroying a fire @-@ temple and replacing it with a mosque . 
 = = = = The Saffarids ( 869 – 903 CE ) = = = = 
 The Abbasids were followed by the Saffarids . Zoroastrians lived under the leadership of their High Priest , since they had no king . In Iraq , the political center of the Sassanian state , Zoroastrian institutions were viewed as appendages of the royal government and family , and suffered much destruction and confiscation . Closely associated with the power structures of the Persian Empire , Zoroastrian clergy quickly declined after it was deprived of the state support . 
 = = = = The Samanids ( 819 – 999 CE ) = = = = 
 The Samanids were of Zoroastrian theocratic nobility who voluntarily converted to Sunni Islam . During their reign , approximately 300 years after the Arab conquest , fire temples were still found in almost every province of Persia including Khorasan , Kirman , <unk> and other areas under Samanid control . According to Al @-@ <unk> , there were fire @-@ temples even in Baghdad at the time . The historian Al @-@ Masudi , a Baghdad @-@ born Arab , who wrote a comprehensive treatise on history and geography in about 956 , records that after the conquest : 
 <unk> , for the time being , continued to exist in many parts of Iran . Not only in countries which came relatively late under Muslim sway ( <unk> Tabaristan ) but also in those regions which early had become provinces of the Muslim empire . In almost all the Iranian provinces , according to Al Masudi , fire temples were to be found – the <unk> he says , venerate many fire temples in Iraq , Fars , Kirman , Sistan , Khurasan , Tabaristan , al <unk> , Azerbaijan and Arran . 
 He also added Sindh and Sin of the Indian subcontinent ( Al @-@ Hind ) to the list . This general statement of al Masudi is fully supported by the medieval geographers who make mention of fire temples in most of the Iranian towns .

 = = = = Migration to India = = = = 
 At the beginning of the 10th century a small group of Zoroastrians living around the town of <unk> and Fort of Sanjan in the province of ( greater ) Khorasan , decided that Iran was no longer safe for Zoroastrians and their religion , and decided to emigrate to India . They traveled to the island of <unk> in the Persian Gulf , and after three years ' preparation set sail for India . They landed on Diu Island of the coast of Gujarat in the year 936 CE . There they lived for about 20 years in great difficulty . They learned the local language and presented their case to Jadi Rana , the Hindu king of that region . 
 Jadi Rana in return for some promises of behavior , allowed them to settle in his kingdom . The refugees accepted the conditions and founded the settlement of Sanjan ( Gujarat ) , which is said to have been named after the city of their origin ( Sanjan , near Merv , in present @-@ day Turkmenistan ) , that they had left behind in Iran nearly 30 years earlier . They consecrated their first Atash <unk> fire within five years of coming to Sanjan ( Gujarat ) . 
 This attracted other Zoroastrians from Iran and also some Zoroastrians who had individually come over the years and settled in various parts of western India . This first group was followed by a second group , also from Greater Khorasan , within five years of the first , and this time having religious implements with them ( the <unk> ) . In addition to these <unk> or <unk> – mountain folk , as the two initial groups are said to have been initially called – at least one other group is said to have come overland from Sari ( in present @-@ day Mazandaran , Iran ) . After that , there were several smaller migrations from different parts of Iran into the same region of India , with each wave bringing with them their own ways of performance of Zoroastrian ceremonies and rituals . 
 This was the start of the Parsis in India . They have since lived in peace with the Hindus and their relationship with Hindus is full of accord and amity . The community still exists in western India , and it currently contains the largest concentration of Zoroastrians in the world . " Parsi legends regarding their ancestors ' migration to India depict a beleaguered band of religious refugees escaping the harsh rule of fanatical Muslim invaders in order to preserve their ancient faith . " The epic poem <unk> @-@ i @-@ Sanjan ( Story of Sanjan ) is an account of the early years of Zoroastrian settlers on the Indian subcontinent . It is only in recent times that Parsis have become aware of the extent of the oppression that their ancestors in Iran had to endure . 
 = = = = The Safavids ( 1502 – 1747 CE ) = = = = 
 Zoroastrians had difficult time during the Safavid period and faced repeated persecution and forced conversion . Safavid kings sought to compel them to accept Shia Islam , Sunnis too were forced to convert to Shia or were killed . Zoroastrians were also branded as impure , in addition to being infidels . As earlier in the century , so this period also witnessed sporadic campaigns for the conversion of Armenians and Zoroastrians , focusing blame for economic and other ills on these and other minorities whose involvement in the spice export , for example , was well known . 
 In the early 16th century the great Safavid king , Shah Abbas I settled a number of Zoroastrians in a suburb of his new capital , Isfahan . The suburb of Isfahan where the Zoroastrians lived was called Gabr @-@ Mahal , <unk> or <unk> , derived from the word Gabr . Europeans who visited his court left accounts of the ' <unk> ' or ' <unk> ' , ( an insulting term used for Zoroastrians by the Muslims ) , agree on the poverty and simplicity of their lives . Fearing desecration by Muslims , Zoroastrians hid the sacred fires , and conversed in a newly invented dialect called Dari . Later Safavid kings were not as tolerant as Shah Abbas . Muhammad Baqir <unk> persuaded Sultan Husayn ( 1688 – 1728 CE ) to decree the forcible conversion of Zoroastrians , those who refused were killed . 
 The accounts in Mino <unk> , written during the <unk> period , demonstrate that the Zoroastrians were subjected to harassment by the Shi 'ite majority , their places of worship were under a constant threat of being destroyed . By 1707 , when Le Bruyn visited Isfahan , the Zoroastrians were no longer able practice their religion freely . He notes that the most deprived Zoroastrians had been brought to Isfahan , and had been forced to become Muslim three years earlier . In 1821 , Ker Porter visiting Isfahan notes that there were hardly any Zoroastrians left in Isfahan and <unk> was in ruins . 
 = = = = Qajar Dynasty ( 1796 – 1925 CE ) = = = = 
 A Zoroastrian astrologer named Mulla <unk> predicted the fall of the Zand dynasty to the Qajar army in Kerman . Because of <unk> 's forecast , the Zoroastrians of Kerman were spared by the conquering army of Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar . Despite the aforementioned favorable incident , the Zoroastrians during the Qajar dynasty remained in agony and their population continued to decline . Even during the rule of Agha Mohammad Khan , the founder of the dynasty , many Zoroastrians were killed and some were taken as captives to Azerbaijan . Zoroastrians regard the Qajar period as one of their worst . 
 Many foreign visitors to Iran of the time had commented on their pitiful situation . Traveller <unk> Jackson noted that Zoroastrians lived in constant fear of persecution by Muslim extremists and their lives were in danger whenever the fanatical spirit of Islam broke out , such as the one witnessed by him in Yazd . According to Edward Browne , the wall of Zoroastrian houses had to be lower than that of the Muslims and prohibited from marking their houses with distinctive signs . Zoroastrians were forbidden from erecting new houses and repairing old ones . 
 Various methods were used to proselytize the minorities . According to a law , if any member of family converted to Islam , he / she was entitled to all inheritance . They were forbidden from taking up lucrative occupations . The community was regarded as outcast , impure and untouchable . The Zoroastrians and their food was considered impure and many public places refused to serve them . When they shopped in the bazaar , they were not allowed to touch any food or fruits . They were threatened with forced conversions , beaten up and fleeced , and their religious sanctuaries were regularly desecrated . <unk> and persecution were the norms of daily life . Zoroastrians were often attacked and beaten by Muslims in the streets . The murders of Zoroastrians were not punished . At times , Zoroastrian girls were kidnapped and forcefully converted and married to Muslims and brought to town in fanfare . 
 Zoroastrians were subjected to public discrimination through dress regulations – not allowed to wear new or white clothes , and compelled by enactments to wear the dull yellow raiment already alluded to as a distinguishing badge . They were not allowed to wear overcoats but were compelled to wear long robes called <unk> and cotton <unk> on their feet even in winter . Wearing eyeglasses , long cloak , trousers , hat , boots , socks , winding their turbans tightly and neatly , carrying watch or a ring , were all forbidden to Zoroastrians . During the rainy days they were not allowed carry umbrellas or to appear in public , because the water that had run down through their bodies and cloths could pollute the Muslims . Zoroastrian men in Yazd would carry a large shawl that they would place under their feet when visiting a Muslim 's home so as to prevent the carpet from being polluted . Forbidden from riding horses and only allowed to ride mules or donkeys , upon facing a Muslim they had to dismount . Not until 1923 , was the general proscription against Zoroastrians ' riding horses and donkeys lifted by Reza Shah . 
 On top of all the misery the Zoroastrians had to pay a heavy religious tax known as Jizya . Zoroastrian sources record the method of extracting this as designed to humiliate the dhimmi , the taxed person , who was compelled to stand while the officer receiving the money sat on a high throne . Upon receiving the payment , the officer gave the dhimmi a blow on the neck and drove him roughly away . The public was invited to watch the spectacle . Arab tax collectors would mock Zoroastrians for wearing <unk> and would rip it off , hanging the cord around the necks of the beleaguered faithful . Due to corruption of the tax officials , at times twice and even three times the official figure would be collected , because every intermediary had to receive his share . If the families could not afford paying the Jizya , their children were beaten and even tortured and their religious books were thrown in fire . That is how the term “ the <unk> ” came about . Under the woeful conditions , some had to convert and there were those who declared themselves Muslims , picked up Islamic names , but in secret continued Zoroastrian practices . Today the latter group among the Zoroastrians is known as <unk> . In response to persecution and segregation policies , the Zoroastrians community became closed , introverted , and static . 
 Zoroastrian massacres did not cease during the Qajar rule . The last two are recorded at the villages surrounding the city of <unk> and <unk> near Yazd . Today , the village of Maul Seyyed Aul near <unk> , among the local people is known as “ killing site ” ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , and Zoroastrian surnames of Turk , Turki , <unk> and <unk> reflect lineage to the survivors of <unk> . In the 1850s , Comte de Gobineau , the French Ambassador to Iran wrote : " Only 6000 of them are left and just a miracle may save them from extinction . These are the descendants of the people who one day ruled the world . " 
 Due to the extent of oppression , and destitution , many Zoroastrians ventured to the hazardous journey to India . Those who could not afford the voyage aboard the ships , risked their lives by crossing the hostile desert on donkeys or even on foot . In India , they were recognized for <unk> and <unk> and were sheltered by their Parsi brethren . There , they formed the second major Indian Zoroastrian community known as the <unk> . 
 = = = = Emissaries to Iran = = = = 
 When the news of their plight reached the Parsis , who by this time had become quite prosperous , Parsi funds were set up to help the Iranian Zoroastrians and emissaries were dispatched to Iran . A Parsi philanthropist , Maneckji <unk> <unk> , was sent to help them . He found only <unk> Zoroastrians in Kerman , Yazd and Tehran ( now the capital of Iran ) . Using his influence with the British government he managed to get some of the repression against Zoroastrians removed . Jizya was paid by the Zoroastrian minority until 1882 , when it was removed by pressure on the Qajar government from the Persian Zoroastrian <unk> Fund . 
 = = = = Islamic Republic of Iran ( 1979 @-@ Present CE ) = = = = 
 The 1979 Islamic Revolution was equally traumatic for the remaining Zoroastrians , and their numbers reduced drastically . Immediately after the revolution , during <unk> 's premiership , Muslim revolutionaries " walked into the main Zoroastrian fire temple in Tehran and removed the portrait of the Prophet Zoroaster and replaced it with one of [ Ayatollah ] Khomeini " . 
 Iran is regarded by the United Nations and other non @-@ governmental organizations as among the world 's worst offenders against freedom of religion — alongside Saudi Arabia and Sudan . Members of religious minorities are , by law and practice , barred from being elected to a representative body ( except to the seats in the <unk> reserved for minorities , as provided for in the Constitution ) and from holding senior government or military positions . They also suffer discrimination in the legal system , receiving lower awards in injury and death lawsuits , and incurring heavier punishments , than Muslims . Muslim men are free to marry non @-@ Muslim women but marriages between Muslim women and non @-@ Muslim men are not recognized .

 Mazdakism was viewed by the Zoroastrian hierarchy as a heresy and consequently persecuted by Zoroastrian Sassanian leaders . The Sassanian ruler Khosrau I launched a campaign against the <unk> in 524 or 528 , culminating in a massacre killing most of the adherents , including Mazdak himself and restored orthodox Zoroastrianism as state religion . 
 Various accounts specify the way of death : e.g. the Shahnameh states that the three thousand <unk> were buried alive with the feet upwards in order to present Mazdak with the spectacle of a " human garden " , whereas Mazdak himself was hanged upside down and shot with countless arrows ; other stories specify other torturous methods of execution . In any case , <unk> then proceeded to implement his own far @-@ reaching social and administrative reforms . Mazdakism almost disappeared after the massacre . Later , there were instances in which Zoroastrian clergy were assisted by Muslims against Zoroastrians whom the Zoroastrian clergy considered to be heretics or separatists .

 According to Mary Boyce , Zoroastrians living under Christian rule in Asia Minor were noted to have undergone hardship , notably during the long conflict between the Roman Empire and Persia .

 = Maria Ulfah Santoso = 
 Meester Hajjah Maria Ulfah Soebadio Sastrosatomo ( 18 August 1911 – 15 April 1988 ) , better known by her first married name Maria Ulfah Santoso , was an Indonesian women 's rights activist and politician . She was the first Indonesian woman to receive a degree in law as well as the first female Indonesian cabinet member . 
 Santoso , the daughter of a politician , became interested in women 's rights after seeing numerous injustices in her youth . Despite pressure to become a doctor , she graduated with a degree in law from Leiden University in 1933 ; while in the Netherlands she also became involved in the Indonesian nationalist movement , Upon returning to the Dutch East Indies , Santoso began teaching and working towards marriage reform . She was a member of the Committee for Preparatory Work for Indonesian Independence , and later became the social minister from 12 March 1946 to 26 June 1947 . After her term , she continued to work with the government in various capacities . 
 Chosen for the cabinet post in part for her emancipatory activities , Santoso paved the way for other female cabinet members , including S. K. Trimurti in 1947 . She received several awards from the Indonesian government for her activities .

 = = = Early life and activism = = = 
 Santoso was born in <unk> , Banten , Dutch East Indies , on 18 August 1911 to <unk> Mohammad Achmad and his wife R.A. Hadidjah <unk> . The youngest of three children , Santoso spent her childhood in Kuningan , where her father served as regent . One day , an ill aunt came over looking for help . However , upon receiving a letter from her husband , the aunt returned home and died not long after . Santoso later described this incident as inspiring her to work for women 's rights . 
 While Santoso was still in elementary school , her father sent her to Batavia ( modern day Jakarta ) to live with a Dutch family at <unk> Elementary School ; while in Batavia she completed her middle schooling at <unk> Willem III Middle School . While in Batavia , Santoso observed further women 's issues , such as how women were devastated when their husbands took second wives or divorced them without cause . Despite her father wanting her to be a doctor , Santoso insisted on going into law . 
 Santoso went to The Hague , in the Netherlands , in 1929 with her father , who was furthering his studies . Santoso then enrolled at Leiden University in Leiden , from which she graduated in 1933 with a Meester in de <unk> ( Master of Laws ) degree ; this made her the first Indonesian woman to earn a law degree . During her studies , she became involved with the Indonesian nationalist movement and its leaders , including Mohammad Hatta and Sutan Sjahrir . 
 In 1934 , Santoso returned to Batavia and took a teaching job at the Muhammadiyah @-@ run teacher 's college there , refusing a position in the colonial government to do so . While teaching , she continued to be active in the nationalist movement , helping Adam Malik to establish the news agency Antara . On February 1938 she married R. Santoso <unk> . That same year , she led a congress dealing with marriage reform , to better protect the rights of women ; the reforms passed in 1941 . Santoso also worked to promote women 's literacy through sewing groups ; women who came to study sewing would be invited to learn to read and about marriage rights and child @-@ rearing . 
 = = = Government work = = = 
 After the Japanese occupied Indonesia in 1942 , Santoso left her work as a teacher and found employment as legal assistant to Soepomo , who later became the country 's first minister of justice . In 1945 , with the Japanese preparing to withdraw from the Indies and the proclamation of independence looming , Santoso became a member of the Committee for Preparatory Work for Indonesian Independence . On 12 March 1946 , Santoso became the first ever female cabinet member when she was selected as services minister in the Second Sjahrir Cabinet . Working quickly and efficiently , she found herself organising the return of internees from Japanese @-@ run camps . She was kept on through the Third Sjahrir Cabinet , but when it dissolved on 26 June 1947 , Santoso refused another term as social minister . She instead chose to work as head of prime minister Amir Sjarifuddin 's secretariat . She kept this position into the First Hatta Cabinet . During Operation Kraai , a Dutch @-@ led offensive on the city of Yogyakarta on 19 December 1948 , her husband was killed outside <unk> . 
 In 1949 , Santoso was part of a committee tasked with preparing a marriage bill " in keeping with the spirit of modern times " . Throughout the 1950s , Santoso kept herself busy with numerous social works . From 1950 until 1961 she served as the head of Indonesia 's film censorship bureau , a position which she held reluctantly . She also served as the head of the National Women 's Congress , <unk> , from 1950 to 1961 . 
 Santoso married again , this time to Indonesian Socialist Party figure Soebadio Sastrosatomo , on 10 January 1964 . The couple were often separated when <unk> was imprisoned for his political activities , but they were able to go on the hajj together . During the 1960s Santoso continued to be politically active , serving in the State Secretariat from 1962 to 1967 and on the State Advisory Council from 1967 to 1972 . While with Sastrosatomo , she adopted a child . 
 In her final years , Santoso and Sastrosatomo lived off of their pensions in Jakarta ; in her obituary , Tempo magazine reported that the pension was barely enough for day @-@ to @-@ day expenses . She died at 2 : 15 am on 15 April 1988 , after being treated at <unk> Subroto Air Force Hospital in Jakarta for more than a month . She was buried at Kalibata Heroes Cemetery .

 Soebadio Sastrosatomo wrote that Santoso 's selection as social minister was important for several reasons . Firstly , her selection showed that the government truly respected women 's contributions to the nationalist movement . Secondly , it was a way for Sjahrir to show that the Indonesian people were committed to the needs of their people , by having a woman deal with women 's issues . After Santoso , other women have held government positions . The second female Indonesian minister , S. K. Trimurti , served as minister of labour from 1947 to 1948 . In 2001 , Megawati Sukarnoputri became the first female president of Indonesia . 
 Santoso received several awards from the Indonesian government , including the Satya Lencana Karya Satya ( Level II ) ( Medal of Great Work ) , Satya Lencana <unk> <unk> Kemerdekaan ( Medal in Memory of Freedom Fighting ) , and Bintang Mahaputra Utama ( Third Class ) ( Mahaputra Star ) . The Bintang Mahaputra is Indonesia 's highest award for civilians .

 " Good Enough " was written by Amy Lee for her long @-@ time friend and husband , Josh Hartzler . It was produced by Dave Fortman and recorded in Record Plant Studios , Los Angeles . The single was scheduled for release in Germany in a basic and premium format on December 14 , 2007 , but a release date was never officially announced . While discussing Evanescence 's then upcoming album , The Open Door , Lee revealed that one of the tracks would be called " Good Enough " . She said , " It 's called ' Good Enough , ' and it 's completely , completely , completely different for me because it sort of [ has a ] happy ending . It 's the last song that I wrote for the record , and it 's sort of the bravest , I think , for me because I had to tell the truth and the truth is , I feel , good now . The rest of the album is pretty aggressive and dark and everything else , but the last one is like , I got to the good place that I was heading for and I wrote about how good I felt . It turned out amazing , but it 's like nothing we 've ever done . I just have to write from my heart and be genuine , because I think that 's what people loved about our music to begin with , and if that changes , then that changes . " 
 The song , which was the last one written for the album , was placed at the end of the album because it " marks a new beginning " for the band , which was the theme on the album and a theme in Lee 's life . In the booklet of The Open Door , she stated that her long @-@ time friend and husband , Josh Hartzler , was the main inspiration for the song . In the booklet she wrote , " Josh , you are my muse . Nothing inspires me the way you do . Thank you for all my missing pieces . Thank you for your strength and love . Thank you for letting me see myself through your eyes , because only then could I know that I am good enough for you . " One of the band 's previous singles , " Bring Me to Life " , was also written about Josh Hartzler . In an interview with VH1 , Lee further revealed the inspiration behind the song , saying " I had gone through a lot of difficult things during the writing of the whole album , and by the end of it , I had stepped away from those bad situations . That 's really hard . You have to be really brave and strong about it . After doing that , I felt so amazing . For the first time I felt like I could write a song based on how good I felt . I have never done that before ever . During another interview with The Washington Post she stated : 
 " That song -- the last one I wrote for the record -- is definitely the most representative of me now , the way that I feel . If we 're talking about the ' new me , ' that 's it and why it 's at the end of the record . You have to go through those things and make the changes you have to make and be there and go , ' Okay , I did it . ' It doesn 't come that easy . [ ... ] I just didn 't hold back this time , and writing that way has made me feel really purified , like I 've actually gotten a chance to break through instead of just wallowing in all of my problems . It 's not about all the times that I 've been afraid and tormented and sad , it 's about looking at those situations and stomping them out . It feels really good to sing these songs now . " 
 In a 2004 interview with MTV News , Amy Lee revealed that she was composing music for the film , The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe . She also revealed that the producers of the movie offered her a small role , saying " They were like , ' Do you want to do a cameo ? ' And I was like , ' Hell yeah ! Let me die . I want to be somebody who gets murdered . ' So I don 't think that 's going to happen . " She later revealed that " Lacrymosa " and another song were originally written for the film , but were not included . According to the producers of the movie , neither Lee or the band were approached to compose music for the film . Another song was also written for the movie , but it was rejected because of its dark sound . On the band 's official blog forum and in a radio interview , Lee stated that a part of the song which was written for the movie was used in " Good Enough " .

 " Good Enough " received mostly positive reviews from music critics . In his review of The Open Door , Ed Thompson of the website IGN , stated that the fans who were " looking for the full @-@ blown piano ballad " reminiscent of " My Immortal " ( 2004 ) had to wait until the album 's final track . He added that at the end of the album they were awarded with " not only the most beautiful song on the album , but also the most unique song Lee has ever released . " He further said , " despite Lee 's voice giving the tune a funereal cast , there is no hiding the fact that the lyrics are of an upbeat nature . ' Shouldn 't have to torture me so sweetly , now I can 't let go of this dream , I can 't breathe but I feel good enough , I feel good enough for you . ' " Bill Lamb of the website About.com , put the song in his list of Top Tracks from The Open Door along with " Sweet Sacrifice " , " Call Me When You 're Sober " , " Your Star " and " Lacrymosa " . Jon Dolan from Entertainment Weekly said that " [ ... ] the deceptively soft ' Good Enough ' flirts again with the dark side , offering ' Drink up sweet decadence / I can 't say no to you ' and striking a final note of cathartic badness . " Kathy McCabe of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Lee 's " newfound confidence " is evident in the song . In his review of The Open Door , Andree Farias of Christianity Today concluded that though the song " leaves a sweet taste in your mouth " , it may not mean much in " a scheme . " He added that the song stands as a contrast to everything else in the album . 
 A writer for The Boston Globe called the song a " lone glimmer in the gloom " with " incongruously downtrodden groove " , adding that fans of Evanescence would like the song . Blabbermouth.net 's Don Kaye found the song to be a " melancholy ballad " . Richard Harrington of The Washington Post found some quiet moments on The Open Door most notably on the " haunting ballad ' Good Enough ' " and on " Like You " . Writing for the magazine St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch , Sara Berry concluded that the band balanced the " scorching rock anthems " with " reflective , piano @-@ heavy ballads " like " Lithium " and " Good Enough " . She further found an " intimate @-@ sounding setting " which featured just Lee and her piano . The Providence Journal 's Rick Massimo , wrote that the song is " being rather melodramatic but melodically successful " . Chris Harris of Rolling Stone wrote that Lee is " stroking the ivories and delivering her lyrics with an elegant sweetness " which he found reminiscent of Tori Amos and Sarah McLachlan . A writer for Reuters called the song " as intense and affecting as anything before it -- and this time , Amy Lee 's lyric steps from the dark side , reveling in the relief of positivity . " 
 Jason <unk> of The Courier @-@ Mail praised the song , calling it " <unk> arranged but lyrically uplifting " . A writer for Blender was negative towards the song , writing " Tori Amos for junior high <unk> ? We wish . ' Good Enough ' is a piano ballad so formless and maudlin we were shocked it made the last Evanescence album – and now it 's a single . How bad ? Too corny for Vanessa Carlton , too sophomoric for Jewel , too whispy for Enya . " Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote that in the song Lee sounds " like a very average Middle American girl who yearns to be ' Good Enough ' but who suffers from an above @-@ average attraction to magnetic and destructive dudes . " A writer for Sputnikmusic praised the softness of the song giving it a grade of 4 @.@ 5 . Although Jordan Reimer of The Daily Princetonian praised the song , he added that it couldn 't match " the haunting beauty " of " My Immortal " . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic found " Tori @-@ isms " in the song .

 A music video directed by Marc Webb and Rich Lee was filmed in Budapest , Hungary between June 11 and June 14 , 2007 . Lee made a guest appearance on MTV 's Total Request Live ( TRL ) on September 10 , 2007 , to premier the video . A writer for MTV News found the video to be " dark and cinematic , it 's almost as if you swallowed an entire feature length film in 3 minutes . " Another writer for the rock magazine Blender was negative towards the video saying that it " makes singer Amy Lee 's soul bearing that much more drawn @-@ out with ill @-@ advised slow motion shots of ( yep ) decay and destruction . ( Oh , look at the record melt ! ) Redemption ? You got it in the form of CGI tree roots , a breaking sunrise and a sudden wet t @-@ shirt contest .

 The music video features Lee in a warehouse and begins with her burying a photograph beneath a hole in the floorboards . After she walks away singing " Under your spell again , I can 't say no to you " while looking directly in the camera , the hole in the floorboard slowly covers up . As she walks by a bookcase , she touches the books placed on it and they start smoking . Then she goes to her desk to write in a diary , while the floorboards and items surrounding her begin to melt . After finishing with the writing , she walks by a mirror and takes a look at herself as it starts to melt . As she begins to play a baby grand piano , the piano and the room surrounding her begin to catch on fire until rain begins to fall and extinguishes the flames . The room appears to be burnt and wasted . As the sun begins to shine through the windows of the building , a small vine grows from the floorboard and expands across the room , and blue flowers begin to blossom from the vines above the piano .

 Antananarivo ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ; Malagasy pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) , then temporarily French Tananarive ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ; French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> ] ) , also known by its French colonial shorthand form Tana , is the capital and largest city in Madagascar . The larger urban area surrounding the city , known as Antananarivo @-@ <unk> ( " Antananarivo @-@ Mother Hill " or " Antananarivo @-@ Capital " ) , is the capital of Analamanga region . The city is located 1 @,@ 280 m ( 4 @,@ 199 ft ) above the sea level in the center of the island , and has been the island 's largest population center since at least the 18th century . 
 Antananarivo was historically the capital of the Merina people , who continue to form the majority of the city 's estimated 1 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 ( 2013 ) inhabitants , as well as the surrounding urban areas which in all have a total metropolitan population approaching three million . All 18 Malagasy ethnic groups , as well as residents of Chinese , Indian , European and other origins , are well represented in the city . 
 Antananarivo is the political , economic , educational and cultural heart of Madagascar . The Presidency , National Assembly , Senate and Supreme Court are located here , as are 21 diplomatic missions and the headquarters of many national and international businesses and NGOs . Antananarivo also hosts the largest number of universities , nightclubs , art venues , medical services and other social service institutions of any city on the island . Several national and local sports teams , including the championship @-@ winning national rugby team , the Makis , and several basketball and football teams , are based in Antananarivo . 
 Antananarivo was founded from about 1610 to 1625 , when the Merina king Andrianjaka ( 1612 – 1630 ) expelled the Vazimba inhabitants of the village of Analamanga at the highest meeting point of two forested ridges rising above the surrounding highland plains . Declaring it the site of his capital , Andrianjaka built a rova ( fortified royal dwelling ) that expanded to become the royal palaces of the Kingdom of Imerina . According to oral history , he deployed a garrison of 1 @,@ 000 soldiers to capture and guard the site ; the hill and its city retained the name Analamanga until the reign of King Andriamasinavalona ( 1675 – 1710 ) , who renamed it Antananarivo ( " City of the Thousand " ) in honor of Andrianjaka 's soldiers . The city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Imerina from its founding until 1710 , when Imerina split into four warring quadrants . Antananarivo was declared the capital of the southern quadrant ; it remained thus until King Andrianampoinimerina of Ambohimanga captured the province and restored its role as capital of a united Kingdom of Imerina in 1794 . His diplomatic and military successes extended Imerina far beyond its traditional borders , bringing the lands of neighboring ethnic groups under Merina control . These conquests were continued under his son , Radama I , whose control ultimately extended over two thirds of the island , leading him to be considered the King of Madagascar by European diplomats , with Antananarivo as the island 's capital . Antananarivo remained the island 's capital after Madagascar was colonized by the French in 1897 and remained thus after independence in 1960 . The French killed off many of the original inhabitants of the island and made French the native language . 
 Antananarivo has expanded gradually from the royal palaces at its center , which dominate every view from their location at the peak of a curving ridge 200 m ( 660 ft ) above the surrounding Betsimitatatra plains . In the 17th century , the plains were transformed into paddy fields to meet the population 's need for rice ; they were covered with housing developments as the city 's population grew rapidly in the 20th century . Around the palaces , which were destroyed in a 1995 fire but have since been partially reconstructed , lies the historic district that was formerly populated by members of the andriana ( noble class ) ; many of their homes are preserved . The Analakely valley at the base of the ridge was the site of a Friday market established in the 18th century that , until being discontinued in 1997 due to traffic congestion , was considered the largest open air market in the world . This neighborhood was further developed under French rule and continues to serve as the capital 's economic heart . The city is managed by the Commune Urbaine d 'Antananarivo ( CUA ) under the direction of its President of the Special Delegation , Ny Havana <unk> , appointed in March 2014 . Limited funds and mismanagement have hampered consecutive CUA efforts to manage overcrowding and traffic , waste management , pollution , security , public water and electricity , and other challenges linked to explosive population growth . Major historic landmarks and attractions in the city include the reconstructed royal palaces and the Andafiavaratra Palace , the tomb of Rainiharo , Tsimbazaza Zoo , Mahamasina Stadium , Lake Anosy , four 19th @-@ century martyr cathedrals , and the Museum of Art and Archaeology . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Antananarivo was originally the site of a town called Analamanga , meaning " Blue Forest " in the central highlands dialect of the Malagasy language . Analamanga was established by a community of Vazimba , the island 's first occupants . Andrianjaka ( approximately 1612 – 1630 ) , king of the Merina people who migrated to the region from the southeast coast , seized the location as the site of his capital city . According to oral history , he deployed a garrison of 1 @,@ 000 soldiers to successfully capture and guard the site . The hill and its city retained the name Analamanga until the reign of King Andriamasinavalona ( 1675 – 1710 ) , who renamed it Antananarivo ( " City of the Thousand " ) in honor of Andrianjaka 's soldiers .

 = = = Kingdom of Imerina = = = 
 Unlike most capital cities in southern Africa , Antananarivo was already a major city before the colonial era . After expelling the Vazimba who inhabited the town at the peak of Analamanga hill , Andrianjaka chose the site for his rova ( fortified royal compound ) , which expanded over time to enclose the royal palaces and the tombs of Merina royalty . The city was established in around 1610 or 1625 according to varying accounts . Early Merina kings used fanampoana ( statute labor ) to construct a massive system of irrigated paddy fields and dikes around the city to provide adequate rice for the growing population . These paddy fields , of which the largest is called the Betsimitatatra , continue to produce rice . 
 Successive Merina sovereigns ruled over the Kingdom of Imerina from Analamanga through King Andriamasinavalona 's reign . This sovereign gave the growing city its current name ; he established the Andohalo town square outside the town gate , where all successive sovereigns delivered their royal speeches and announcements to the public , and assigned the names of numerous locations within the city based on the names of similar sites in the nearby village of <unk> . Andriamasinavalona designated specific territories for the hova ( commoners ) and each andriana ( noble ) subcaste , both within the neighborhoods of Antananarivo and in the countryside surrounding the capital . These territorial divisions were strictly enforced ; members of subcastes were required to live within their designated territories and were not authorized to stay for extended periods in the territories reserved for others . Numerous fady ( taboos ) , including injunctions against the construction of wooden houses by non @-@ nobles and the presence of swine within the city limits , were imposed . 
 Upon Andriamasinavalona 's death in 1710 , Imerina split into four warring quadrants and Antananarivo was made the capital of the southern district . During the 77 @-@ year civil war that followed , the eastern district 's capital at Ambohimanga rose in prominence . The last king of Ambohimanga , Andrianampoinimerina , successfully conquered Antananarivo in 1793 ; he reunited the provinces of Imerina , ending the civil war . He moved the kingdom 's political capital back to Antananarivo in 1794 , and declared Ambohimanga the kingdom 's spiritual capital , a role it still maintains . Andrianampoinimerina created a large marketplace in Analakely , establishing the city 's economic center . 
 = = = Kingdom of Madagascar = = = 
 By the time Andrianampoinimerina 's son Radama I had ascended the throne upon his father 's death in 1810 , Antananarivo was the largest and most economically important city on the island , with a population of over 80 @,@ 000 inhabitants . Radama opened the city to the first European settlers , artisan missionaries of the London Missionary Society ( LMS ) who arrived in 1820 and opened the city 's first public schools . James Cameron introduced <unk> to the island and created Lake Anosy to generate hydraulic power for industrial manufacturing . Radama established a military training ground on a flat plain called Mahamasina at the base of Analamanga near the lake . Radama 's subjugation of other Malagasy ethnic groups brought nearly two thirds of the island under his control . The British diplomats who concluded trade treaties with Radama recognized him as the " ruler of Madagascar " , a position he and his successors claimed despite never managing to impose their authority over the larger portion of the island 's south . Thereafter , Merina sovereigns declared Antananarivo the capital of the entire island . 
 Radama 's successor Ranavalona I invited a shipwrecked craftsman named Jean Laborde to construct the tomb of Prime Minister Rainiharo , and Manjakamiadana ( built 1839 – 1841 ) , the largest palace at the Rova . Laborde also produced a wide range of industrial products at factories in the highland village <unk> and a foundry in the Antananarivo neighborhood Isoraka . Ranavalona oversaw improvements to the city 's infrastructure , including the construction of the city 's two largest staircases at Antaninarenina and <unk> , which connect la ville moyenne ( " the middle town " ) to the central marketplace at Analakely . In 1867 , following a series of fires in the capital , Queen Ranavalona II issued a royal decree that permitted the use of stone and brick construction in buildings other than tombs . LMS missionaries ' first brick house was built in 1869 ; it bore a blend of English , Creole and Malagasy design and served as a model for a new style of house that rapidly spread throughout the capital and across the highlands . Termed the trano gasy ( " Malagasy house " ) , it is typically a two @-@ story , brick building with four columns on the front that support a wooden veranda . In the latter third of the 19th century , these houses quickly replaced most of the traditional wooden houses of the city 's aristocratic class . The growing number of Christians in Imerina prompted the construction of stone churches throughout the highlands , as well as four memorial cathedrals on key sites of martyrdom among early Malagasy Christians under the reign of Ranavalona I. 
 Until the mid 19th century , the city remained largely concentrated around the Rova of Antananarivo on the highest peak , an area today referred to as la haute ville or la haute ( " upper town " ) . As the population grew , the city expanded to the west ; by the late 19th century it extended to the northern hilltop neighborhood of Andohalo , an area of low prestige until British missionaries made it their preferred residential district and built one of the city 's memorial churches here from 1863 to 1872 . From 1864 to 1894 , Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony governed Madagascar alongside three successive queens , Rasoherina , Ranavalona II and Ranavalona III , effecting policies that further transformed the city . In 1881 , he reinstated mandatory universal education first introduced in 1820 under Radama I , requiring the construction of numerous schools and colleges , including teacher training colleges staffed by missionaries and the nation 's first pharmacy ( 1862 ) , medical college and modern hospital ( 1865 ) . Rainilaiarivony built the Andafiavaratra Palace in 1873 as his residence and office at a site near the royal palace .

 The French military invaded Antananarivo in September 1894 , prompting the queen 's surrender after a cannon shell blasted a hole through a building at the Rova , causing major casualties . The damage was never repaired . Andohalo square was remodeled to feature a gazebo , walkways and planted landscaping . Claiming the island as a colony , the French administration retained Antananarivo as its capital and transcribed its name as Tananarive . They chose Antaninarenina as the site for the French Governor General 's Residency ; upon independence it was renamed Ambohitsorohitra Palace and converted into presidential offices . Under the French , tunnels were constructed through two of the city 's largest hills , connecting disparate districts and facilitating the town 's expansion . Streets were laid with cobblestones and later paved ; sewer systems and electricity infrastructure were introduced . Water , previously obtained from springs at the foot of the hill , was brought from the Ikopa River . 
 This period saw a major expansion of la ville moyenne , which spread along the lower hilltops and slopes of the city centered around the French Residency . Modern urban planning was applied in la ville basse ( " lower town " ) , which expanded from the base of the city 's central hills into the surrounding rice fields . Major boulevards like Avenue de l 'Indépendance , planned commercial areas like the arcades lining either side of the Avenue , large parks , city squares and other landmark features were built . A railway system connecting Soarano station at one end of the Avenue de l 'Indépendance in <unk> with Toamasina and Fianarantsoa was established in 1897 . Beyond these planned spaces , neighborhoods densely populated by working class Malagasy expanded without state oversight or control . 
 The city expanded rapidly after World War II ; by 1950 its population had grown to 175 @,@ 000 . Roads connecting Antananarivo to surrounding towns were expanded and paved . The first international airport was constructed at <unk> , 45 km ( 28 mi ) outside the city ; this was replaced in 1967 with Ivato International Airport approximately 15 km ( 9 mi ) from the city center . The University of Antananarivo was constructed in the <unk> neighborhood and the Museum of Ethnology and Paleontology was also built . A city plan written in 1956 created suburban zones where large houses and gardens were established for the wealthy . In 1959 , severe floods in la ville basse prompted the building of large scale embankments along the edges of the Betsimitatatra rice fields and the establishment of new ministerial complexes on newly drained land in the Anosy neighborhood .

 After independence in 1960 , the pace of growth increased further . The city 's population reached 1 @.@ 4 million by the end of the 20th century ; in 2013 , it was estimated at nearly 2 @.@ 1 million . <unk> urban sprawl has challenged the city 's infrastructure , producing shortages of clean water and electricity , sanitation and public health problems , and heavy traffic congestion . There are more than 5 @,@ 000 church buildings in the city and its suburbs , including an Anglican and a Roman Catholic cathedral . Antananarivo is the see city of Madagascar 's Roman Catholic Archdiocese . The city has repeatedly been the site of large demonstrations and violent political clashes , including the 1972 rotaka that brought down president Philibert Tsiranana and the 2009 Malagasy political crisis , which resulted in Andry Rajoelina replacing Marc Ravalomanana as head of state .

 Antananarivo is situated approximately 1 @,@ 280 m ( 4 @,@ 199 ft ) above sea level in the central highlands region of Madagascar , at 18 @.@ 55 ' South and 47 @.@ 32 ' East . The city is located centrally along the north @-@ south axis of the country , and east of center along the east @-@ west axis . It is 160 km ( 99 mi ) from the east coast and 330 km ( 210 mi ) from the west coast . The city occupies a commanding position on the summit and slopes of a long , narrow , rocky ridge extending north and south for about 4 km ( 2 mi ) and rising to about 200 m ( 660 ft ) above the extensive rice fields to the west . 
 The official boundaries of the city of Antananarivo encompass an urban area of approximately 86 @.@ 4 km2 ( 33 @.@ 4 sq mi ) . It was founded 1 @,@ 480 m ( 4 @,@ 860 ft ) above sea level at the apex of three hill ranges that converge in a Y form , 200 m ( 660 ft ) above the surrounding Betsimitatatra paddy fields and the grassy plains beyond . The city gradually spread out from this central point to cover the hillsides ; by the late 19th century it had expanding to the flat terrain at the base of the hills . These plains are susceptible to flooding during the rainy season ; they are drained by the Ikopa River , which skirts the capital to the south and west . The western slopes and plains , being best protected from cyclone winds originating over the Indian Ocean , were settled before those to the east . 
 Greater Antananarivo is a continuous , urbanized area spreading beyond the city 's official boundaries for 9 km ( 5 @.@ 6 mi ) north to south between <unk> and <unk> , and 6 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) west to east between the Ikopa River dike and <unk> . The population of the greater Antananarivo area was estimated at 3 million people in 2012 ; it is expected to rise to 6 million by 2030 . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Under the Köppen @-@ Geiger climate classification system , Antananarivo has a subtropical highland climate ( Cwb ) characterized by mild , dry winters and warm , rainy summers . The city receives nearly all of its average annual rainfall between November and April . Frosts are rare in the city ; they are more common at higher elevations . Mean temperatures range from 20 @.@ 8 ° C ( 69 @.@ 4 ° F ) to 14 @.@ 3 ° C ( 57 @.@ 7 ° F ) . 
 = = Cityscape = = 
 Antananarivo encompasses three ridges that intersect at their highest point . The Manjakamiadana royal palace is located at the summit of these hills and is visible from every part of the city and the surrounding hills . The <unk> was the largest structures within the rova of Antananarivo ; its stone casing is the only remnant of the royal residences that survived a 1995 fire at the site . For 25 years , the roofless shell dominated the skyline ; its west wall collapsed in 2004 . In 2009 , the stone casing had been fully restored and the building was re @-@ roofed . It is illuminated at night . Conservation and reconstruction work at the site is ongoing . The city skyline is a jumble of colorful , historic houses and churches . More recent residential and commercial buildings and family rice fields occupy lower terrain throughout the capital . The Betsimitatatra and other rice fields surround the city . 
 The city 's neighborhoods emerge from historic ethnic , religious and caste divisions . The assignment of certain neighborhoods to particular noble sub @-@ castes under the Kingdom of Imerina established divisions ; the highest ranking nobles were typically assigned to neighborhoods closest to the royal palace and were required to live in higher elevation portions of the city . During and after French colonization , expansion of the city continued to reflect these divisions . Today , the calm and quiet haute ville is mainly residential and viewed as a prestigious area in which to live ; many of the city 's wealthiest and most influential Malagasy families live there . The part of la haute closest to the Rova contains much of the city 's pre @-@ colonial heritage and is considered its historic part . It includes the royal palace , Andafiavaratra Palace — the former residence of Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony , Andohalo — the principal town square until 1897 , a cathedral near Andohalo built to commemorate early Malagasy Christian martyrs , the city 's most intact historic entrance gate and the 19th @-@ century houses of Merina nobles . 
 Under the Kingdom of Madagascar , the commoner class ( hova ) settled at the periphery of the noble districts , gradually spreading along the slopes of the lower hills during the late 19th century . This ville moyenne became increasingly populous under French colonial authority , which targeted them for redesign and development . Today , the neighborhoods in the ville moyenne are densely populated and lively , containing residences , historic sites and businesses . The neighborhood of Antaninarenina contains the historic Hôtel Colbert , numerous jewelers ' shops and other luxury goods stores , and administrative offices . In addition to Antaninarenina , the principal neighborhoods of la ville moyenne are <unk> on the eastern hills and <unk> and Isoraka to the west , all of which are largely residential . Isoraka has developed lively nightlife , with houses converted to upscale restaurants and inns . Isoraka also houses the tomb of Prime Minister Rainiharo ( 1833 – 1852 ) , whose sons and later Prime Ministers Rainivoninahitriniony and Rainilaiarivony are buried with him . Bordering these neighborhoods are the commercial areas of <unk> and Andravoahangy . 
 The commercial center of town , Analakely , is located on the valley floor between these two ville moyenne hill ranges . King Andrianampoinimerina established the city 's first marketplace on the grounds today occupied by the market 's tile @-@ roofed pavilions , constructed in the 1930s . Andrianampoinimerina decreed Friday ( Zoma ) as market day , when merchants would erect stalls shaded with white parasols , which extended throughout the valley forming what has been called the largest open air marketplace in the world . The market caused traffic congestion and safety hazards prompting government officials to divide and relocate the Friday merchants to several other districts in 1997 . The city 's other main commercial and administrative neighborhoods , which spread out from Analakely and extend into the adjacent plain , were established by the French , who drained and filled in the extant rice fields and swampland to create much of the area 's current design and infrastructure . The Avenue de l 'Indépendance runs from the gardens of <unk> south of the market pavilions , through Analakely to the city 's railroad station at Soarano . To the west of Soarano lies the dense commercial district of <unk> ; it is the only district to be built on a grid and is the center of the city 's South Asian community . Behoririka , to the east of Soarano , is built around a lake of the same name and abuts the sprawling Andravoahangy district at the eastern edge of the city . Antanimena borders Soarano and Behoririka to the north . A tunnel built by the French in the early 20th century cuts through the hillside ; it connects <unk> with <unk> and other residential areas in the south of the city . 
 Since pre @-@ colonial times the lower classes , including those descended from the slave class ( andevo ) and rural migrants , have occupied the flood @-@ prone lower districts bordering the Betsimitatatra rice fields to the west of the city . This area is connected to Analakely by a tunnel constructed by the French in the early 20th century . The tunnel opens toward Lake Anosy and the national Supreme Court buildings , and provides access to the residential neighborhood of Mahamasina and its stadium . The bordering neighborhood of Anosy was developed in the 1950s to house most of the national ministries and the Senate . Anosy , the planned residential district of Soixante @-@ Sept <unk> ( often abbreviated to " 67 " ) and the neighborhood of Isotry are among the city 's most densely populated , crime ridden and impoverished neighborhoods . Approximately 40 percent of inhabitants with electricity in their homes in the ville basse obtain it illegally by splicing into city power lines . In these areas , houses are more vulnerable to fires , flooding and landslides , which are often triggered by the annual cyclone season . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 Before the mid @-@ 19th century , all houses and marketplaces in Antananarivo , and throughout Madagascar , were constructed of woods , grasses , reeds and other plant @-@ based materials viewed as appropriate for structures used by the living . Only family tombs were built from stone , an inert material viewed as appropriate to use for the dead . British missionaries introduced brick @-@ making to the island in the 1820s , and French industrialist Jean Laborde used stone and brick to build his factories over the next few decades . It was not until the royal edict on construction materials was lifted in the 1860s that stone was used to encase the royal palace . Many aristocrats , inspired by the royal palace and the two @-@ story , brick houses with wrapped verandas and divided interior spaces built by British missionaries , copied the British model for their own large homes in the haute ville . The model , known as trano gasy ( " Malagasy house " ) , rapidly spread throughout the central highlands of Madagascar , where it remains the predominant house construction style . 
 Since 1993 , the Commune <unk> d 'Antananarivo ( CUA ) has increasingly sought to protect and restore the city 's architectural and cultural heritage . In 2005 , CUA authorities partnered with the city planners of the Île @-@ de @-@ France to develop the Plan Vert – Plan Bleu strategy for creating a classification system for Zones de Protection du Patrimoine Architectural , Urbain et <unk> , areas of the city benefiting from legal protection and financial support for their historic and cultural heritage . The plan , which is being implemented by the Institut des Métiers de la Ville , prevents the destruction of historic buildings and other structures , and establishes construction codes that ensure new structures follow historic aesthetics . It also provides for awareness raising campaigns in favor of historic preservation and undertakes projects to restore dilapidated historic buildings and sites . Under this plan , 19th @-@ century sites , like the <unk> tribunal and the second residence of Rainilaiarivony , have been renovated . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 Antananarivo has been the largest city on the island since at least the late 18th century , when its population was estimated at 15 @,@ 000 . By 1810 , the population had grown to 80 @,@ 000 before declining dramatically between 1829 and 1842 during the reigns of Radama I and especially Ranavalona I. Because of a combination of war , forced labor , disease and harsh measures of justice , the population of Imerina fell from 750 @,@ 000 to 130 @,@ 000 during this period . In the final years of the Kingdom of Imerina , the population had recovered to between 50 @,@ 000 and 75 @,@ 000 ; most of the population were slaves who were largely captured in provincial military campaigns . In 1950 , Antananarivo 's population was around 175 @,@ 000 . By the late 1990s the population of the metropolitan area had reached 1 @.@ 4 million , and - while the city itself now has a population ( 2013 ) of about 1 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 - with suburbs lying outside the city limits it had grown to almost 2 @.@ 1 million in 2013 . The metropolitan area is thus home to 10 percent of the island 's residents . Rural migration to the capital propels this growth ; the city 's population exceeds that of the other five provincial capitals combined . 
 As the historic capital of Imerina , Antananarivo is centrally located in the homeland of the Merina people , who comprise about 24 percent of the population and are the largest Malagasy ethnic group . The city 's history as the island 's major center for politics , culture and trade has ensured a cosmopolitan mix of ethnic groups from across the island and overseas . Most Antananarivo residents have strong ties to their <unk> ( ancestral village ) , where the extended family and typically a family tomb or burial place is located ; many older residents leave the city upon retirement to return to their rural area of origin . 
 = = = Crime = = = 
 Despite ongoing efforts by the Ministry of Domestic Security , crime has worsened in Antananarivo since 2009 . Between 1994 and 1998 , the city had an average of eight to twelve police officers for every 10 @,@ 000 inhabitants ; large cities should typically have closer to fifteen . Under the mayorship of Marc Ravalomanana ( 1998 – 2001 ) , street lights were installed or repaired throughout the city to improve night @-@ time safety . He increased the number of police officers on the streets , leading to a drop in crime . As of 2012 , the city lacks a comprehensive strategy for reducing crime . The recent increase in crime and the inadequate response from the CUA has prompted the growth of private security firms in the city . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Agriculture is the mainstay of the Malagasy economy . Land is used for the cultivation of rice and other crops , raising of zebu and other livestock , the fabrication of bricks and other traditional livelihoods . In Antananarivo , access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every resident of the city . The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land , but demand dramatically outstrips supply and much of the unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for <unk> , such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted . Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land @-@ seeking residents , creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city . This uncontrolled development poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas . 
 Industry accounts for around 13 percent of Madagascar 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) and is largely concentrated in Antananarivo . Key industries include soap production , food and tobacco processing , brewing , textiles , and leather manufacturing , providing employment to around 5 @.@ 5 percent of the workforce . The city 's extensive infrastructure and its role as the economic center of the country make it a favorable location for large businesses . Business owners are drivers of growth for the city ; in 2010 , 60 percent of all new buildings in the country were located in Antananarivo , most of which were built for commercial purposes . Unemployment and poverty are also growing , fueled in part by an inadequately skilled and unprofessional workforce and the lack of a comprehensive national strategy for economic development since 2009 . Formal sector job growth has not kept pace with population growth , and many residents earn their livelihood in the informal sector as street vendors and laborers . Under Ravalomanana , construction in the capital increased sharply ; twelve new supermarkets were constructed in two years . 
 The residents of urban areas — in particular Antananarivo — have been hardest hit by economic downturns and economic policy shifts . The national economic crisis in the mid @-@ 1970s and early 1980s , and the World Bank 's imposition of a structural adjustment program lowered living standards for the average resident of the city . The end of state subsidies , rapid inflation , higher taxes , widespread impoverishment and the decline of the middle class were especially evident in Antananarivo , as was the growing wealth of a tiny political and economic elite in the city . In 2007 , two thirds of Antananarivo residents had access to electricity , while ten percent of households owned a scooter , car or other motor vehicle . Running water was installed in fewer than 25 percent of homes , small restaurants and businesses in 2007 , necessitating the collection of water from household wells or neighborhood pumps and the use of outdoor pit toilets detached from the main building . In 2007 , 60 percent of households were using shared public latrines . Most homes use charcoal for daily cooking ; stocks of charcoal and rice are kept in the kitchen . The average city household spends just under half of its budget on food . Owing to its increasingly high cost , consumption of meat by city residents has sharply declined since the 1970s ; the urban poor eat meat on holidays only once or twice a year . 
 = = Culture = = 
 In Antananarivo and throughout the highlands , Merina and Betsileo families practice the famadihana , an ancestor reburial ceremony . This ceremony typically occurs five to seven years after the death of a relative and is celebrated by removing the relative 's lamba @-@ wrapped remains from the family tomb , <unk> it with fresh silk shrouds and returning it to the tomb . Relatives , friends and neighbors are invited to take part in the music , dancing and feasting that accompanies the event . The famadihana is costly ; many families sacrifice higher living standards to set aside money for the ceremony . 
 = = = Historic sites and museums = = = 
 The tangible and intangible cultural heritage of Antananarivo is extensive and highly significant to regional and national populations . The city has numerous monuments , historic buildings , sites of significance and traditions related to the customs and history of the central highlands people . The city skyline is dominated by the Rova of Antananarivo , which was destroyed in a 1995 fire but are undergoing reconstruction . The nearby Andafiavaratra Palace was the home of 19th century Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony and currently contains a museum featuring historic artifacts of the Kingdom of Imerina , including items saved from the fire at the Rova . Downhill from the palaces is Andohalo square , where Merina kings and queens delivered speeches to the public . Tsimbazaza Zoo displays many of the island 's unique animal species and a complete skeleton of the now @-@ extinct elephant bird . Other historic buildings include the <unk> tribunal where Ranavalona I dispensed judgement , the second residence of Rainilaiarivony with its indigenous medicinal plant garden , the recently renovated Soarano railroad station , four late 19th century memorial churches built to commemorate early Malagasy Christian martyrs , the tomb of Prime Minister Rainiharo , and the early 20th century pavilions of the Analakely market . Open air markets include Le <unk> and the artisan market at Andravoahangy . The Museum of Art and Archaeology in the Isoraka neighborhood features exhibits on the history and cultures of Madagascar 's diverse ethnic groups . 
 = = = Arts = = = 
 The arts scene in Antananarivo is the largest and most vibrant in the country . Madagascar 's diverse music is reflected in the many concerts , cabarets , dance clubs and other musical venues throughout Antananarivo . In the dry season , outdoor concerts are regularly held in venues including the <unk> amphitheater and Mahamasina Stadium . Concerts and night clubs are attended mainly by young people of the middle to upper classes who can afford the entrance fees . More affordable are performances of traditional <unk> or Malagasy operettas at Isotry Theater and hira gasy at the city 's outdoor <unk> theater or Alliance française ; these performances are more popular with older and rural audiences than among urban youth . Nightlife is the most animated in the ville moyenne neighborhoods of Antaninarenina , <unk> , Behoririka , Mahamasina and Andohalo . 
 The Palais des Sports in the Mahamasina neighborhood is the country 's only indoor performance space built to international standards . It was built in 1995 by the Government of China ; it regularly hosts concerts , dance and other arts performances , expositions and novelty events like monster truck rallies . The city lacks a dedicated classical music performance space , and concerts by international artists are infrequent . Performances of classical , jazz and other foreign musical genres , modern and contemporary dance , theater and other arts occur at cultural arts centers funded by foreign governments or private entities . Among the best @-@ known of these are the Centre <unk> Albert Camus and Alliance française d 'Antananarivo , both funded by the French <unk> the Cercle Germano @-@ Malgache , a branch of the Goethe @-@ Institut funded by the German government ; The American Center is funded by the United States government . Antananarivo has two dedicated cinemas , the Rex and the Ritz , both of which were built in the colonial era . These venues do not show international releases but occasionally screen Malagasy films or are used for private events and religious services . 
 = = = Sports = = = 
 Rugby Union is considered the national sport of Madagascar . The national rugby team is nicknamed the Makis after the local word for the indigenous ring @-@ tailed lemur . The team trains and plays domestic matches at Maki Stadium in Antananarivo . Constructed in 2012 , the stadium has a capacity of 15 @,@ 000 and houses a gym and administrative offices for the team . It replaces their former home , <unk> Stadium , which had a capacity of approximately 3 @,@ 000 that was regularly exceeded by the number of attendees . Several soccer teams are also based in Antananarivo ; AS Adema Analamanga and <unk> are associated with the Analamanga region ; <unk> Foot is associated with the CUA and the AS Saint Michel has been affiliated since 1948 with the historic secondary school of the same name . All four teams train and play local games in Mahamasina Municipal Stadium , the largest sporting venue in the country . The men 's basketball teams Challenger and SOE ( <unk> du Stade <unk> de l <unk> ) are based in Antananarivo and play in the Palais des Sports at Mahamasina . 
 = = Government = = 
 Antananarivo is the capital of Madagascar and the federal governance structures , including the Senate , National Assembly , the Supreme Court and the presidential office are housed there . The main presidential offices are located 15 km ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) south of the city . The nationwide move toward decentralization beginning in the mid @-@ 1990s produced several laws , including the Loi no . 94 @-@ 009 of 26 April 1995 and the <unk> 96 – 168 of 6 March 1996 , which provided Antananarivo with a distinctive status . They also defined additional governance roles for the city , making it the administrative seat of the Analamanga region , the district of Antananarivo @-@ <unk> and the Commune Urbaine d 'Antananarivo ( CUA , Antananarivo city proper ) . The city hosts the diplomatic missions of 21 countries . 
 The CUA is divided into six numbered arrondissements ( administrative sub @-@ districts ) ; it has historically been administered by an elected mayor and associated staff . Since the 2009 political crisis , in which the former mayor of Antananarivo , Andry Rajoelina , unconstitutionally seized power as head of state , the CUA has been administered by a <unk> spéciale ( special delegation ) composed of a president and de facto mayor with the support of two vice presidents , all of whom are appointed by the President . The position of President of the Special Delegation has been held by Ny Havana <unk> since March 2014 . 
 The mayoral administration of the CUA is empowered to govern the city with de jure autonomy ; a wide range of mechanisms have been established to facilitate governance , although they are of limited effectiveness . An urban master plan guides major policies for city management but personnel within the mayoral office commonly lack the urban planning and management ability to effectively implement the plan in response to long @-@ term and immediate needs . This challenge is compounded by the high turnover rate of mayors and staff that frequently disrupts initiatives begun by previous CUA administrations . A mayor under former president Didier Ratsiraka created " red zones " ; areas where public gathering and protests were prohibited . On 28 June 2001 , Ravalomanana abolished these areas , liberalizing freedom of assembly . 
 Antananarivo has suffered from debt and mismanagement . The CUA estimated in 2012 that the cost of running the city to international standards would reach US $ 100 million annually , while annual revenues average around $ 12 million . In good years , the CUA is able to reserve $ 1 – 2 million to spend on city improvement projects . By 2008 , the city 's treasury had accumulated 8 @.@ 2 billion Malagasy ariary — approximately US $ 4 @.@ 6 million — in debts under previous mayors . In 2008 , water was cut off at public pumps and there were regular brownouts of city 's street lights because of 3 @.@ 3 million ariary of unpaid debts to the Jirama public utilities company by the City of Antananarivo . In response , then @-@ mayor Rajoelina undertook an audit that identified and sought to address long @-@ standing procedural irregularities and corruption in the city 's administration . The CUA continues to be challenged by a shortage of revenues relative to its expenses caused by the high cost of retaining the large number of CUA personnel , weak structures for managing revenues from public rents and inadequate collection of tax revenues from city residents and businesses . 
 = = = Twin towns and sister cities = = = 
 Antananarivo has established sister city agreements with four cities . The city was twinned with Yerevan , Armenia in 1981 . The city is also twinned with <unk> , Russia ; Suzhou , China ; and Montreal , Canada . A sister city relationship between Antananarivo and Nice , France , established in 1962 , is not currently active . 
 = = Education = = 
 Most of Madagascar 's public and private universities are located in Antananarivo . This includes the country 's oldest higher education institute , the College of Medicine established under the Merina monarchy and the University of Antananarivo , established under the French colonial administration . The city hosts many private pre @-@ primary , primary and secondary schools and the national network of public schools . The city houses a French international school , Lycée Français de Tananarive , as well as an American school , American School of Antananarivo , and a Russian school , the Russian Embassy School in Antananarivo . 
 The nation 's most prestigious dance school , K 'art Antanimena , is located in Antananarivo . Other major dance schools based in the city include Le Club de Danse de l 'Université Catholique de Madagascar , Club de danse Kera arts <unk> à Antanimena and Le Club Mills . 
 = = Health and sanitation = = 
 In general , availability and quality of health care is better in Antananarivo than elsewhere in Madagascar , although it remains inadequate across the country relative to that in more developed countries . One of Madagascar 's two medical schools is located in Antananarivo ; most medical technicians and specialists are trained there . Neonatal and antenatal care is significantly better in Antananarivo than elsewhere on the island . Despite the presence of facilities and trained personnel , the high cost of health care places it beyond the reach of most residents of Antananarivo . Pharmaceuticals are imported , making them particularly unaffordable ; traditional herbal medicines remain popular and are readily available in local markets frequented by most of the population . 
 The large population in Antananarivo and the high density of its residential zones pose challenges to public health , sanitation and access to clean drinking water . Processing and disposal of industrial and residential waste is inadequate . Waste water is often discharged directly into the city 's waterways . Air pollution from vehicle exhausts , residential coal @-@ burning stoves and other sources is worsening . While the city has set up clean water pumps , they remain inadequate and are not distributed according to population density , worsening access in the poorest and most populous parts of the city . Antananarivo is one of the two urban areas in Madagascar where bubonic plague is endemic . 
 These problems were diminished but not eliminated under the mayoral administration of Marc Ravalomanana , who prioritized sanitation , security and public administration . He obtained funds from international donors to establish garbage collection and disposal systems , restore dilapidated infrastructure such as roads and marketplaces , and replant public gardens . To improve sanitation in the city , he constructed public latrines in densely populated and highly frequented areas . 
 = = Transport and communications = = 
 The majority of the city 's residents move about Antananarivo on foot . The CUA sets and enforces rules that govern a system of 2 @,@ 400 franchised private minibuses running on eighty @-@ two numbered routes throughout the city . An additional 2 @,@ 000 minibuses managed by the Ministry of Transportation run along eight lines into the neighboring suburbs . These interlinked bus systems served around 700 @,@ 000 passengers each day . These minibuses often fail to meet safety standards or air quality requirements and are typically overcrowded with passengers and their cargo . Police and gendarmes assist in regulating traffic at peak periods in the morning and evening , or around special events and holidays . Private licensed and unlicensed taxis are common ; most vehicles are older Renaults or <unk> . Newer vehicles congregate near hotels and other locales frequented by foreigners willing or able to pay higher prices for better services . 
 The city is encircled by a ring road and connected by direct routes nationales ( national highways ) to Mahajanga , Toliara , Antsirabe , Fianarantsoa and Toamasina . Branches and feeder roads from these major highways connect the city to the national road network . Antananarivo is connected by train to Toamasina to the east and Manakara to the southeast via Antsirabe and Fianarantsoa . The city 's principal railway station is centrally located at Soarano at one end of the Avenue de l 'Indépendance . Ivato International Airport is located approximately 15 kilometres ( 9 miles ) from the center of the city , connecting <unk> to all national airports . Ivato is the hub of the national airline Air Madagascar , and is the only airport on the island hosting long @-@ haul carriers . Direct flights connect Antananarivo to cities in South Africa , Europe and Asia . 
 Government television and radio broadcasting centers , and the headquarters of numerous private stations are located in Antananarivo . Eighty percent of households in Antananarivo own a radio ; the medium is popular across social classes . Stations like <unk> 'ny Merina appeal to Merina listeners of all ages by playing traditional and contemporary music of the highlands region . Youth @-@ oriented stations play a blend of Western artists and Malagasy performers of Western genres , as well as fusion and coastal musical styles . Evangelical broadcasts and daily international and local news are available in Malagasy , French and English . Forty percent of Antananarivo residents own a television receiver . All major Malagasy newspapers are printed in the city and are widely available . Communications services in Antananarivo are the best in the country . Internet and mobile telephone networks are readily available and affordable , although disruptions in service occur periodically . The national postal service is headquartered in Antananarivo , and private international shipping companies like FedEx , DHL Express and United Parcel Service provide services to the city . 
 = Vought XSO2U = 
 The Vought XSO2U was an American observation floatplane developed by Vought @-@ Sikorsky for the United States Navy during the late 1930s . Intended to replace the Curtiss SOC Seagull in service as a scout aboard cruisers , it proved superior to the Curtiss SO3C in evaluation , but failed to win a production contract due to Vought 's lack of manufacturing capacity . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 In the late 1930s the United States Navy developed a set of specifications for a new scout @-@ observation aircraft to operate from its cruisers in the reconnaissance and gunnery spotting roles . Intended to replace the Curtiss SOC biplane , the requirements included that the aircraft should have folding wings , have a superior range and speed to that of the SOC , and that the new type should be powered by the Ranger V @-@ 770 inline engine . 
 Designs were submitted in response to the Navy 's specifications by Vought @-@ Sikorsky and Curtiss @-@ Wright . The Vought design , designated Model 403 by the company , was similar to the company 's OS2U Kingfisher , which was then under development to replace the SOC aboard U.S. Navy battleships , but had its monoplane wing moved higher on the fuselage than that of the Kingfisher , and differed in the attachment method used by its single @-@ float landing gear . In addition , the radial engine of the OS2U was replaced by an inline Ranger V @-@ 770 in a squared @-@ off cowling . 
 Capable of being operated with either the float as a seaplane or with a conventional <unk> undercarriage as a landplane , the XSO2U utilised all @-@ metal construction , with the exception of its control surfaces which were fabric @-@ covered . The wings folded to the rear for storage in a manner similar to that of the Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber , . 
 The aircraft was capable of performing dive bombing , and could be fitted with a single bomb or depth charge on a hardpoint under each wing for the mission , or for anti @-@ submarine warfare . Gun armament consisted of two M2 Browning machine guns , one mounted in a fixed position firing forwards through the propeller using <unk> gear , while the other was in a flexible position in the observer 's cockpit for rear defense . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 Assigned the serial number 1440 , the XSO2U @-@ 1 flew for the first time , as a landplane , in July 1939 ; its first flight as a seaplane took place that December . Flight testing of the <unk> showed that the aircraft lacked directional stability ; the addition of a large ventral fin , connecting the rear of the float to the tail , helped to cure the problem . 
 The aircraft also suffered from engine problems , however , that were not so easily cured ; the Ranger engine was well known for unreliability , and was particularly prone to overheating problems that were never <unk> solved . The aircraft 's original XV @-@ 770 @-@ 4 engine was replaced by a XV @-@ 770 @-@ 6 , with a repositioned oil cooler , during flight testing ; despite this , the problems continued . 
 Despite the engine issues , the <unk> @-@ 1 was considered overall to be superior to the competing Curtiss <unk> @-@ 1 ; however , Vought 's production capacity was already taken up by manufacture of the OS2U Kingfisher scout and F4U Corsair fighter . As a result , the <unk> was declared the winner of the contract , and was ordered into production . Named Seagull by the U.S. Navy , and <unk> by the Royal Navy , the SO3C developed a disastrous reputation in service , and was retired before the SOC biplane which it was intended to replace . 
 Following the end of the flyoff competition , the XSO2U @-@ 1 was used as a general utility aircraft and hack by the Navy , before being supplied to the Ranger Engine Corporation in July 1942 for use in tests of the V @-@ 770 engine . These tests were intended to assist in debugging the engine for the Bell XP @-@ 77 lightweight fighter and Edo <unk> floatplane , but the V @-@ 770 remained troublesome , and after two years of testing the XSO2U was returned to the Navy . Having no further use for the aircraft , the XSO2U @-@ 1 was removed from the Navy 's rolls on 6 July 1944 , being subsequently scrapped .

 The 188th Infantry Brigade is an infantry training brigade of the United States Army based at Fort Stewart , Georgia . It is a subordinate unit of the First United States Army , Division East . 
 Active from 1921 to 1942 as part of the 94th Infantry Division , the brigade was transformed into a reconnaissance troop during and after World War II , supporting the 94th Division as it fought in Europe . Activated again from 1997 — 1999 and again in 2006 , the unit gained responsibility for conducting training for other reserve component army units with a variety of purposes . Today , the unit is responsible for training selected United States Army Reserve and National Guard units East of the Mississippi River . 
 = = Organization = = 
 The brigade is subordinate to First Army Division East of the First United States Army , one of several regional training brigades spread throughout the United States . 
 The brigade consists of seven primary elements . The brigade 's Headquarters and Headquarters Company , along with its Special Troops Battalion , provides support and oversight to the other six battalions in the brigade . The 1st Battalion , 306th Regiment trains primarily infantry units , while the 2nd Battalion , 306th Regiment trains field artillery units . The 1st Battalion , 347th Regiment provides training for combat support units , while the 3rd Battalion , 345th Regiment oversees combat service support units . The 2nd Battalion , 349th Regiment provides support training for the other battalions and large @-@ scale training operations . The 3rd Battalion , 395th Regiment ( recently realigned from First Army Division West ) trains primarily armor / cavalry units . 
 = = History = = 
 The 188th Infantry Brigade was first constituted on 24 June 1921 in the organized reserves at Boston , Massachusetts . It was organized with two infantry regiments , the 376th Infantry Regiment and the 419th Infantry Regiment . It was , in turn , assigned to the 94th Infantry Division . From 1921 to 1942 the division remained on the Massachusetts organized reserve rolls , though the unit did not assemble except for regular weekend training . In 1925 , the brigade relocated to Worcester , Massachusetts and in 1940 it moved to Springfield , Massachusetts .

 The 94th Infantry Division was mobilized for deployment for World War II on 15 September 1942 at Fort Custer , Michigan . During this mobilization the 188th Infantry Brigade went through a series of reorganizations . The 376th Infantry Regiment continued as part of the 94th Infantry Division and the remainder of the 188th Infantry Brigade became the 94th Reconnaissance Troop , still assigned to the 94th Infantry Division . 
 The 94th Infantry Division , with the troop in tow , landed on Utah Beach on 8 September 1944 , 94 days after D @-@ Day . It and moved into Brittany to assume responsibility for containing some 60 @,@ 000 German troops besieged in the ports of Lorient and Saint @-@ Nazaire . The 94th inflicted over 2 @,@ 700 casualties on the German forces and took 566 prisoners before being relieved on 1 January 1945 . 
 Moving west , the troop followed the division as it took positions in the Saar @-@ Moselle Triangle , facing the Siegfried Switch Line on 7 January 1945 , and shifted to the offensive on 14 January , seizing <unk> and <unk> that day . The following day , the <unk> @-@ Wies area was wrested from the German army , but heavy counterattacks followed and <unk> , Berg , and most of <unk> changed hands several times before being finally secured . On 20 January , an unsuccessful battalion attack against <unk> , eastern terminus of the switch position , cost the division most of two companies . In early February , the division , with troop in tow , took the woods of <unk> and later <unk> . 
 On 19 February 1945 , the division launched a full @-@ scale attack , storming <unk> Ridge , the backbone of the Saar @-@ Moselle Triangle , and captured all of its objectives . Moving forward , the 94th Infantry Division , along with the 10th Armored Division , secured the area from <unk> to the confluence of the Saar and Moselle Rivers by 21 February 1945 . Then , launching an attack across the Saar , it established and expanded a bridgehead . By 2 March 1945 , the division stretched over a 10 @-@ mile ( 16 km ) front , from Hocker Hill on the Saar through <unk> , and <unk> to <unk> . A heavy German attack near <unk> achieved penetrations , but the line was shortly restored , and on 13 March , spearheading the XX Corps , the 94th broke out of the bridgehead and drove to the Rhine River , reaching it on 21 March . Ludwigshafen was taken on 24 March , with assistance from elements the 12th Armored Division . 
 The 94th Infantry Division then moved by railroad and motor to the vicinity of Krefeld , Germany , assuming responsibility for containing the west side of the Ruhr pocket from positions along the Rhine on 3 April . With the reduction of the pocket in mid @-@ April , the 94th Infantry Division was assigned military government duties , first in the Krefeld and later in the Düsseldorf areas . Soldiers of the troop participated in this assignment . 
 The 94th Infantry Division participated in four World War II campaigns on mainland Europe . The 94th Reconnaissance Troop supported the division throughout its push through Europe . Upon the end of fighting in Europe , the 94th Infantry Division began conducting occupation duty in Europe until it returned to the US at the end of 1945 . The Troop was demobilized at Camp Kilmer , New Jersey and deactivated on 7 February 1946 . 
 The troop was reactivated on 13 February 1947 in Boston , Massachusetts . However , the troop did not see any significant actions during its post war years , still a part of the 94th Infantry Division , which itself was never called on for service . The troop was moved to Cohasset , Massachusetts in 1953 , remaining there for another six years as an inactive reserve unit until 1959 , when it was again disbanded and inactivated .

 = Joseph Massino = 
 Joseph Charles Massino ( born January 10 , 1943 ) is an American former mobster . He was a member of the Mafia ( Cosa Nostra ) and was the boss of the Bonanno crime family from 1991 until 2004 , when he became the first boss of one of the Five Families in New York City to turn state 's evidence . 
 Massino was a protégé of Philip Rastelli , who took control of the troubled Bonanno family after the assassination of Carmine Galante . Originally a truck hijacker , Massino secured his own power after arranging two 1981 gang murders , first a triple murder of three rebel captains , then his rival Dominick Napolitano . In 1991 , while Massino was in prison for a 1986 labor racketeering conviction , Rastelli died and Massino succeeded him . Upon his release the following year he set about rebuilding a family that had been in turmoil for almost a quarter @-@ century . By the dawn of the new millennium , he was reckoned as the most powerful Mafia leader in the nation . Massino became known as " The Last Don " , the only full @-@ fledged New York boss of his time who was not in prison . 
 In July 2004 Massino was convicted in a murder and racketeering indictment based on the testimony of several cooperating made men , including Massino 's disgruntled underboss and brother @-@ in @-@ law Salvatore Vitale . He was also facing the death penalty if convicted in a separate murder trial due to be held later that year , but after agreeing to testify against his former associates he was sentenced to life imprisonment for both indictments in 2005 . Massino testified twice for the government , helping win a murder conviction against his acting boss Vincent Basciano in 2011 , and was <unk> to time served in 2013 , though he will be on supervised release for the rest of his life . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Joseph Massino was born on January 10 , 1943 in New York City . He was one of three sons of the Neapolitan @-@ American Anthony and Adeline Massino . Raised in Maspeth , Queens , Massino has admitted to being a juvenile delinquent by the age of 12 and claimed that at 14 he ran away from home to Florida . He dropped out of Grover Cleveland High School in tenth grade . 
 Massino first met his future wife Josephine Vitale in 1956 , and married her in 1960 . The couple had three daughters . Massino also befriended Josephine 's brother , Salvatore Vitale , who , after briefly serving in the Army , became one of Massino 's most trusted allies . While athletic in youth , Massino was an avid cook , and he grew overweight in adulthood . His weight gained him the nickname " Big Joey " and during a 1987 racketeering trial , when he asked FBI agent Joseph Pistone who was to play him in a film adaptation of his undercover work , Pistone joked that they could not find anyone fat enough . By 2004 , Massino was suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure as well . 
 After he turned state 's evidence , Massino claimed his first murder victim was a Bonanno crime family associate named Tommy Zummo , whom he shot dead some time in the 1960s . The killing gained the ire of a Maspeth @-@ based Bonanno <unk> Philip Rastelli , but he remained unaware of Massino 's participation , and a nephew of Rastelli ultimately helped Massino become his protégé . Rastelli would set Massino up as a lunch wagon operator as part of his " Workmen 's Mobile Lunch Association " , an effective protection racket ; after paying a kickback to Rastelli in the form of membership dues , Massino was assured no competition where he operated .

 = = = Rise to power = = = 
 By the late 1960s Massino was a Bonanno associate . He led a successful truck hijacking crew , with the assistance of his brother @-@ in @-@ law Salvatore Vitale and carjacker Duane Leisenheimer , while fencing the stolen goods and running numbers using the lunch wagon as a front . He also befriended another mob hijacker , the future Gambino crime family boss John Gotti . Increasingly prosperous , Massino opened his own catering company , J & J Catering , which became another front for his activities . Massino 's mentor Rastelli was expected to become Bonanno boss upon the 1973 death of Natale Evola , but he had been convicted the previous year of loansharking and then of extortion in 1976 , leaving him imprisoned . In his absence Carmine Galante , a former consigliere and convicted drug trafficker , seized control of the Bonannos as an unofficial acting boss . 
 In 1975 , Massino and Vitale participated in the murder of Vito Borelli , who Massino claimed was primarily executed by Gotti , at the behest of Paul Castellano of the Gambino crime family . The Borelli hit was significant for Massino " making his bones " – proving his loyalty to the Mafia by killing on its behalf – putting him close to becoming a made man , a full member , in the Bonanno family . Massino also arranged the murder of one of his hijackers , Joseph Pastore , in 1976 after having Vitale borrow $ 9 @,@ 000 from him on his behalf . While later acquitted of the crime , both Vitale and Massino would admit to participation after turning state 's evidence . 
 In March 1975 , Massino was arrested at the scene of the arrest of one of his hijackers , Raymond Wean , and charged with conspiracy to receive stolen goods . Massino was scheduled to go on trial in 1977 , but the charges were dropped after he successfully argued that he had not been properly <unk> , disqualifying statements Massino gave to police from being used in trial . 
 On June 14 , 1977 , Massino was inducted into the Bonanno family along with Anthony Spero , Joseph Chilli , Jr. and a group of other men in a ceremony conducted by Carmine Galante . He worked as a soldier in James Galante 's crew , and later worked in Philip " Phil Lucky " Giaccone 's crew . Massino nevertheless remained loyal to Rastelli , then vying to oust Galante despite his imprisonment . Fearing Galante wanted him dead for insubordination , Massino delivered a request to the Commission , the governing body of the American Mafia , on Rastelli 's behalf to have Galante killed . The hit was approved and executed on July 12 , 1979 ; Rastelli subsequently took full control of the family and rewarded Massino 's loyalty by promoting him to capo . 
 By the beginning of the 1980s Massino ran his crew from the J & S Cake social club , a property just behind J & J Catering . The building was seized in 1988 during a crackdown on the Bonannos ' gambling activities . 
 = = = Three capos and Napolitano murders = = = 
 Following the Galante hit , Massino began jockeying for power with Dominick " Sonny Black " Napolitano , another Rastelli loyalist capo . Both men were themselves threatened by another faction seeking to depose the absentee boss led by capos Alphonse " Sonny Red " Indelicato , Dominick " Big <unk> " <unk> and Philip Giaccone . The Commission initially tried to maintain neutrality , but in 1981 , Massino got word from his informants that the three capos were stocking up on automatic weapons and planning to kill the Rastelli loyalists within the Bonanno family to take complete control . Massino turned to Colombo crime family boss Carmine Persico and Gambino boss Paul Castellano for advice ; they told him to act immediately . 
 Massino , Napolitano and <unk> Sciascia , a Sicilian @-@ born capo linked to the Montreal Rizzuto crime family , arranged a meeting at a Brooklyn social club with the three capos for May 5 , 1981 . The three had four gunmen , including Vitale and Bonanno @-@ affiliated Montreal boss Vito Rizzuto , hiding in a closet to ambush them . When Trinchera , Giaccone and Indelicato arrived with Frank Lino to meet Massino they were shot to death , with Massino himself stopping Indelicato from escaping . Lino escaped unscathed by running out the door . The hit further improved Massino 's prestige , but was marred by both Lino 's escape and the discovery of Indelicato 's body on May 20 . 
 Massino quickly won Lino over to his side , but Indelicato 's son Anthony " Bruno " Indelicato vowed revenge . Napolitano assigned associate Donnie Brasco , who he hoped to make a made man , to kill Indelicato . " Brasco " , however , was in fact an undercover FBI agent named Joseph Pistone ; shortly after the hit was ordered Pistone 's assignment was ended and Napolitano was informed of their infiltration . 
 Already skeptical of Napolitano 's support of " Brasco " , Massino was deeply disturbed by the breach of security when he learned of the agent 's true identity . Vitale would later testify that this was the reason Massino subsequently decided to murder Napolitano as well ; as he would later quote Massino , " I have to give him a receipt for the Donnie Brasco situation . " In his own testimony , Massino instead claimed Napolitano was targeted for trying to take over the Bonannos himself . On August 17 the former renegade Frank Lino and Steven Cannone drove Napolitano to the house of Ronald <unk> , a Bonanno family associate , for a meeting . Napolitano was greeted by captain Frank Coppa , then thrown down the stairs to the house 's basement by Lino and shot to death . Napolitano 's body was discovered the following year . 
 Benjamin " Lefty " Ruggiero , who helped Pistone formally become a Bonanno associate , was also targeted , but was arrested en route to the meeting where he was expected to be murdered . On February 18 , 1982 , Anthony Mirra , the soldier who first " discovered " Pistone , was assassinated on Massino 's orders . Mirra had gone into hiding upon Pistone 's exposure but was ultimately betrayed and murdered by his protégé and cousin Joseph D 'Amico . 
 = = = Fugitive and Bonventre murder = = = 
 On November 23 , 1981 , based on information gained by Pistone 's infiltration , six Bonanno mobsters , including the then @-@ missing Napolitano , were indicted on racketeering charges and conspiracy in the three capos hit . 
 In March 1982 , Massino was tipped off by a Colombo @-@ associated FBI insider that he was about to be indicted and went into hiding in Pennsylvania with Leisenheimer . On March 25 , 1982 , Massino was also charged with conspiracy to murder Indelicato , Giaccone and Trinchera and truck hijacking . In hiding , Massino was able to see the prosecution 's strategy and better plan his defense as well as eventually face trial without association with other mobsters . Pistone later speculated Massino also feared retaliation upon the revelation that his associate Raymond Wean had turned state 's evidence . Massino was visited by many fellow mobsters , including Gotti , and Vitale would secretly deliver cash to support him . 
 In 1984 , Rastelli was released from prison , and he and Massino ordered the murder of Bonanno soldier Cesare Bonventre . Still a fugitive , Massino summoned Vitale , Louis Attanasio and James <unk> to his hideout and gave them the order . By this time , Massino was considered by most mobsters to be the boss in all but name , even though Rastelli was still officially head of the family , as well as heir apparent for the title itself . According to Vitale , Massino had Bonventre killed for giving him no support when he was in hiding . 
 Bonventre was called to a meeting with Rastelli in Queens . He was picked up by Vitale and Attanasio and driven to a garage . En route , Attanasio shot Bonventre twice in the head but only wounded him ; he would kill Bonventre with two more shots when they reached their destination . The task of disposing of Bonventre 's corpse was handed to Gabriel Infanti . Infanti promised Vitale that Bonventre 's remains would disappear forever . However , after a tipoff , the remains were discovered on April 16 , 1984 , in a warehouse in Garfield , New Jersey , stuffed into two 55 @-@ gallon glue drums . 
 For his part in the hit , Massino had Vitale initiated into the Bonanno family .

 Through Gotti associate Angelo Ruggiero , Massino was able to meet with defense attorney John Pollok in 1984 to negotiate his surrender . He finally turned himself in on July 7 and was released on $ 350 @,@ 000 bail . That year , Massino and Salvatore Vitale secured no @-@ show jobs with the Long Island based King Caterers in exchange for protecting them from Lucchese extortion . 
 In 1985 Massino was indicted twice more , first as a co @-@ conspirator with Rastelli in a labor racketeering case for controlling the Teamsters Local 814 , then with a conspiracy charge for the Pastore murder that was added to the original three capos indictment . The second indictment also charged Vitale as a co @-@ conspirator in the hijacking cases . 
 The labor racketeering trial began in April 1986 , with Massino as one of twelve defendants including Rastelli and former underboss Nicholas <unk> . While Massino protested in confidence to other mobsters he never had the opportunity to profit from the racket , he was implicated by both Pistone and union official Anthony Gilberti , and on October 15 , 1986 was found guilty of racketeering charges for accepting kickbacks on the Bonannos ' behalf . On January 16 , 1987 Massino was sentenced to ten years imprisonment , his first prison term . Rastelli , also convicted and in poor health during the trial , was sentenced to twelve . Around this time Massino was believed to be the Bonanno family 's official underboss . With Rastelli in declining health , Massino was also reckoned as the operating head of the family , though consigliere Anthony " Old Man " Spero was nominally acting boss . 
 On April 1987 , Massino and Vitale went on trial for truck hijacking and conspiracy to commit the triple murder , defended by Samuel H. Dawson and Bruce Cutler respectively . Prosecutor Michael Chertoff , describing Massino 's rise in his opening statements , would characterize him as the " Horatio Alger of the mob . " Raymond Wean and Joseph Pistone testified against Massino , but both proved unable to conclusively link Massino with any of the murder charges . On June 3 , while both men were convicted on hijacking charges they were cleared of the murder conspiracy charges . Further , the only proven criminal acts took place outside the RICO act 's five @-@ year statute of limitations ; without evidence that the " criminal enterprise " was still active in this timeframe the jury returned a special verdict clearing Massino and Vitale of these charges as well . 
 During Massino 's imprisonment at Talladega Federal Prison for his 1986 conviction Vitale functioned as his messenger , effectively becoming co @-@ acting boss alongside Spero . On Massino 's orders , Vitale organized the murder of Gabriel Infanti , who had also botched a 1982 hit on Anthony Gilberti and was suspected of being an informant .

 During his meetings with Massino in prison Vitale , on behalf of the Bonannos ' capos , urged his brother @-@ in @-@ law to become boss in name as well as in fact . Rastelli had spent all but two years of his reign behind bars , and many felt Massino would bring the family stability . Massino was reluctant to take over as long as Rastelli was alive . Not only was he respectful of Rastelli 's sponsorship of his Mafia career , but Mafia tradition dictates that a boss keeps his title for life unless he abdicates . However , in the spring of 1991 , Massino ordered Vitale to " make me boss " as soon as Rastelli died . Rastelli died in June 1991 . A few days after his funeral , Massino instructed Vitale to call a meeting of the family 's capos , and Massino was acclaimed as boss . 
 Upon his release on November 13 , 1992 Massino retained Vitale as his messenger during his probation and promoted him to underboss . He could not associate with convicted mafiosi during his probation . While the FBI suspected Vitale was a mafioso , he had never been convicted of a crime , and the FBI would have no reason to be suspicious of him associating with Massino since they were brothers @-@ in @-@ law . He returned to his job at King Caterers , and in 1996 became co @-@ owner of Casablanca , a well @-@ reviewed Maspeth Italian restaurant . 
 Massino was 48 years old at the time of his accession , and knew that he potentially had a long reign ahead of him . With this in mind , he was determined to avoid the pitfalls that landed other Mafia bosses in prison . Inspired by Genovese boss Vincent Gigante , Massino forbade his men from saying his name out loud due to FBI surveillance . Instead , they were to touch their ears when referring to him . Massino gained the nickname " The Ear " because of this . Massino took a great number of precautions in regards to security and the possibility of anything incriminating being picked up on a wiretap . He closed the long @-@ standing social clubs of the Bonanno family . He also arranged family meetings to be conducted in remote locations within the United States . In some cases , he held meetings in foreign countries , and had his capos bring their wives along so they could be passed off as vacations . Remembering how Pistone 's infiltration had damaged the family , he also decreed that all prospective made men had to have a working relationship with an incumbent member for at least eight years before becoming made , in hopes of ensuring new mafiosi were as reliable as possible . Unusually for bosses of his era , he actively encouraged his men to have their sons made as well . In Massino 's view , this would make it less likely that a capo would turn informer , since if that happened the defector 's son would face almost certain death . 
 To minimize the damage from informants or undercover investigations Massino introduced a clandestine cell system for his crews , forbidding them from contacting one another and avoiding meeting their capos . He would instead create a new committee that would relay his orders to the crews . In contrast to his contemporaries , particularly the publicity @-@ friendly Gotti and the conspicuous feigned insanity of Gigante , Massino himself was also able to operate with a relatively low public profile ; both Pistone and mob writer Jerry Capeci would consequently refer to Massino as the " last of the old @-@ time gangsters . " 
 A side effect of these reforms was the reduction of Vitale , in his own words , to " a figurehead . " By the time of Massino 's release the Bonanno family had grown tired of Vitale , regarding him as greedy and overstepping his authority . In the new structure of the family , Vitale lost the underboss 's usual role as a go @-@ between for the boss , as well as the share of the family 's profits those duties entailed , and Massino made it clear to Vitale his unpopularity was a factor in these changes . Vitale remained loyal , however , and helped Massino organize the March 18 , 1999 murder of <unk> Sciascia . Massino indicated to fellow mobsters that Sciascia was killed for feuding with fellow Massino @-@ confidant capo Anthony Graziano , accusing him of using cocaine , while in his own testimony Massino claimed Sciascia was killed for killing another mobster 's son . Sciascia 's body was not covertly buried but instead left to be discovered in a street in the Bronx , an attempt to make the hit look like a botched drug deal rather than a Mafia @-@ ordered hit , and Massino had his capos attend Sciascia 's funeral . 
 Shortly after becoming boss , Massino announced that his men should no longer consider themselves as part of the Bonanno family . Instead , he renamed it the Massino family , after himself . Like many mafiosi , he was angered at family namesake Joseph Bonanno 's tell @-@ all autobiography , A Man of Honor , and regarded it as a violation of the code of <unk> . He told Vitale that in his view , " Joe Bonanno disrespected the family by ratting . " The new name was first disclosed after Massino was indicted in 2003 and did not catch on outside the Mafia . 
 = = = Relations with other families = = = 
 Before Massino became boss , John Gotti was one of his closest allies . Massino had backed Gotti in his plot to take over the Gambino family , and as Gambino boss , Gotti tried to get Massino a seat on the Commission as the Bonannos ' acting boss . Gotti was reportedly infuriated that Massino had been officially promoted without him being consulted , and Massino would later testify he believed Gotti conspired with Vitale to kill him . Gotti , however , was marginalized by his 1992 racketeering and murder conviction and consequent life imprisonment . Massino , for his own part , was angered at Gotti 's high public profile and later criticized Gotti for killing his predecessor Paul Castellano . Massino also had a poor relationship with Vincent Gigante , who had backed the opposition to Rastelli and blocked Gotti 's attempts to bring Massino onto the Commission . 
 The Bonanno family had been in decline for the better part of the last quarter century since Joseph Bonanno 's ousting , and it was kicked off the Commission altogether following Pistone 's infiltration . By the late 1990s the situation was reversed , and the Bonanno family was now reckoned as the most powerful crime family in New York and the nation , in no small part because Massino was the only full @-@ fledged New York boss who was still on the streets . As it turned out , being thrown off the Commission actually worked in the Bonannos ' favor ; they were the only family whose leadership wasn 't decimated in the Mafia Commission Trial . Wary of surveillance , Massino generally avoided meeting with members of other Mafia families and encouraged his crews to operate independently as well . In January 2000 , however , Massino did preside over an informal Commission meeting with the acting bosses of the other four families . As the most powerful Mafia leader in both New York and the nation , Massino was in a position to make general policies for the Five Families . Under his direction , the Commission tightened qualifications to become a made man , requiring candidates have full Italian descent ( previously having an Italian @-@ American father was the minimum requirement ) and imposed restrictions on initiating associates convicted on drug charges . 
 According to Capeci , the murder of Sciascia soured relations between the Bonanno and Rizzuto families . Originally considered merely a Canadian Bonanno crew , the <unk> responded by taking even less heed from New York . 
 = = = Run @-@ up to prosecution = = = 
 At the beginning of his reign as boss , Massino enjoyed the benefit of limited FBI attention . In 1987 , with the Bonannos weakened , the FBI merged its Bonanno squad with its Colombo family squad , and this squad was initially preoccupied with the <unk> ' third internal war . Another dedicated Bonanno squad would be established in 1996 . 
 The Bonanno squad 's chief , Jack Stubing , was well aware of the measures Massino had taken to avoid scrutiny . He therefore decided to go after Massino with a rear @-@ guard action . He convinced his bosses to lend him a pair of forensic accountants normally used in fraud investigations , believing that they could easily pinpoint conspirators in the family 's money laundering schemes . Stubing believed that the threat of long prison sentences would be sufficient to get any conspirators to turn informer , and thus make it easier to trace how the money flowed to Massino . In the meantime , the FBI also targeted other members of the Bonanno administration . In 1995 , consigliere Anthony Spero was sentenced to two years imprisonment after being convicted of loansharking , then to life imprisonment in 2002 for murder . Graziano would assume Spero 's duties , but he too plead guilty to racketeering charges in December 2002 and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment . Vitale would also plead guilty to loansharking charges in June 2002 . Vitale was not immediately sentenced , and was placed under house arrest in the interim , but the relatively low maximum sentence he was eligible for lead Massino to wrongly suspect he was cooperating with law enforcement . He secretly ordered that , if he was arrested , Vitale was to be " taken down " - demoted or killed . 
 Until 2002 , the Bonannos had been the only family in the modern history of the New York Mafia ( i. e . , since the Castellammarese War ) to have never had a made man turn informant or government witness . Massino used this as a point of pride to rally his crime family . That year Frank Coppa , convicted on fraud and facing further charges from the FBI 's forensic accounting investigation , became the first to flip . He was followed shortly by acting underboss Richard Cantarella , a participant in the Mirra murder , who was facing racketeering and murder charges . A third , Joseph D 'Amico , subsequently turned state 's evidence with the knowledge that Cantarella could implicate him for murder as well . All of these defections left Massino , at last , vulnerable to serious charges . 
 = = 2004 conviction = = 
 On January 9 , 2003 , Massino was arrested and indicted , alongside Vitale , Frank Lino and capo Daniel <unk> , in a comprehensive racketeering indictment . The charges against Massino himself included ordering the 1981 murder of Napolitano . Massino was denied bail , and Vincent Basciano took over as acting boss in his absence . Massino hired David Breitbart , an attorney he had originally wanted to represent him in his 1987 trial , for his defense . 
 Three more Bonanno made men would choose to cooperate before Massino came to trial . The first was James <unk> ; anticipating he would shortly be indicted as well he went to the FBI and agreed to wear a wire while he remained free . The second was Salvatore Vitale . In custody Massino again put out the word , to a receptive Bonanno family , that he wanted Vitale killed . After learning of Massino 's earlier plans to kill his brother @-@ in @-@ law from Coppa and Cantarella , prosecutors informed Vitale . Vitale was already dissatisfied by the lack of support he and his family received from Massino after his arrest . On the day he was arraigned with Massino , Vitale decided to flip as soon as it was safe to do so ; he formally reached a deal with prosecutors in February . He was followed in short order by Lino , knowing Vitale could implicate him in murder as well . Also flipping was longtime Bonanno associate Duane Leisenheimer , concerned for his safety after an investigator for Massino 's defense team visited to find out if he intended to flip . 
 With these defections , Massino was slapped with a superseding indictment charging him with seven additional murders : the three capos ( this time for participation in the murder itself rather than conspiracy ) , Mirra , Bonventre , Infanti and Sciascia . Of particular interest was the Sciascia hit , which took place after a 1994 amendment to racketeering laws that allowed the death penalty for murder in aid of racketeering . 
 Massino 's trial began on May 24 , 2004 , with judge Nicholas Garaufis presiding and Greg D. Andres and Robert Henoch heading the prosecution . He now faced 11 RICO counts for seven murders ( due to the prospect of prosecutors seeking the death penalty for the Sciascia murder , that case was severed to be tried separately ) , arson , extortion , loansharking , illegal gambling , and money laundering . By this time , Time magazine had dubbed Massino as " the Last Don " , in reference to his status as the only New York boss not serving a prison sentence at that point . The name stuck . 
 Despite a weak start , with opening witness Anthony Gilberti unable to recognize Massino in the courtroom , the prosecution would establish its case to link Massino with the charges in the indictment through an unprecedented seven major turncoats , including the six turned made men . Vitale , the last of the six to take the stand , was of particular significance . He had spent most of his three decades in the Mafia as a close confidant to Massino , and his closeness to his brother in law allowed him to cover Massino 's entire criminal history in his testimony . <unk> 's defense rested primarily on cross @-@ examination of the prosecution witnesses , with his only witness being an FBI agent to challenge Vitale 's reliability . His defense was also unusual in that he made no attempt to contest that Massino was the Bonanno boss , instead stressing the murders in the case took place before he took over and that Massino himself " showed a love of life ... because the murders ceased . " 
 After deliberating for five days the jury found Massino guilty of all eleven counts on July 30 , 2004 . His sentencing was initially scheduled for October 12 , and he was expected to receive a sentence of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole . The jury also approved the prosecutors ' recommended $ 10 million forfeiture of the proceeds of his reign as Bonanno boss on the day of the verdict . 
 = = Turning state 's evidence = = 
 Immediately after his July 30 conviction , as court was adjourned , Massino requested a meeting with Judge Garaufis , where he made his first offer to cooperate . He was facing the death penalty if found guilty of Sciascia 's murder – indeed , one of John Ashcroft 's final acts as Attorney General was to order federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Massino . Massino thus stood to be the first Mafia boss to be executed for his crimes , and the first mob boss to face the death penalty since <unk> <unk> was executed in 1944 . 
 In hopes of saving his life , Massino decided to break his blood oath and turn informer . Massino subsequently claimed he decided to turn informer due to the prospect of his wife and mother having to forfeit their houses to the government . Mob authors and journalists Anthony D. DeStefano and Selwyn Raab both consider the turning of so many made men as a factor in disillusioning Massino with Cosa Nostra , the former also assuming Massino had decided to flip " long before the verdict " . Massino was the first sitting boss of a New York crime family to turn state 's evidence , and the second in the history of the American Mafia to do so ( Philadelphia crime family boss Ralph Natale had flipped in 1999 when facing drug charges ) . It also marked the second time in a little more than a year that a New York boss had reached a plea bargain ; Gigante had pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice charges in 2003 after prosecutors unmasked his long charade of feigning insanity . 
 At his advice , that October the FBI revisited the Queens mob graveyard where Alphonse Indelicato 's body was found , and unearthed the bodies of Trinchera and Giaccone as well . They also hoped to find the body of John Favara , who accidentally killed Gotti 's son , and the body of Tommy <unk> . Massino also reported that Vincent Basciano , arrested in November , had conspired to kill prosecutor Greg Andres , but after failing a polygraph test regarding the discussion he agreed to wear a wire when meeting the acting boss in jail . While Massino was unable to extract an unambiguous confession regarding Andres , he did record Basciano freely admit to ordering the murder of associate Randolph Pizzolo . 
 By the end of January 2005 , when Basciano was indicted for the Pizzolo murder , Massino was identified by news sources as the then @-@ anonymous fellow mobster who secretly recorded his confession , to the public disgust of Massino 's family . Further confirmation of Massino 's defection came in February as he was identified as the source for the graveyard , then in May when the Justice Department dropped the threat of the death penalty regarding the Sciascia case . In a hearing on June 23 , 2005 , Massino finalized his deal and plead guilty to ordering the Sciascia murder . For this and his 2004 conviction he was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences , with a possible reduction depending on his service as a witness . That same day Josephine Massino negotiated a settlement to satisfy the forfeiture claim , keeping the homes of herself and Massino 's mother as well as some rental properties while turning over , among other assets , a cache of $ 7 million and hundreds of gold bars , and the Casablanca restaurant . 
 Massino was not replaced as Bonanno boss until 2013 when Michael Mancuso , who had replaced Basciano as acting boss , was reported to have formally assumed the title . 
 = = = Massino 's testimony and release = = = 
 Massino was conspicuously absent from the prosecution witnesses at the 2006 racketeering trial of Basciano , the prosecution deciding he was not yet needed ; he was also expected to testify against Vito Rizzuto regarding his role in the three capos murder , but the Montreal boss accepted a plea bargain in May 2007 . He finally made his debut as a witness at Basciano 's trial for the murder of Randolph Pizzolo in April 2011 ; Massino 's testified both during the trial itself and , after Basciano was convicted , on behalf of the prosecution 's unsuccessful attempt to impose the death penalty . During his testimony Massino noted , as a result of his cooperation , " I ’ m hoping to see a light at the end of the tunnel . " 
 Massino testified again in the 2012 extortion trial of Genovese capo Anthony <unk> , primarily to provide background as an expert on the American Mafia . While Massino had not worked closely with <unk> , prosecutors decided to use him after another mobster @-@ turned @-@ witness was dropped ; the case ended in an acquittal . Massino had also been considered as a witness in the 2013 murder trial of Colombo acting boss Joel Cacace , but was dropped after he was unable to fully remember the meeting where he claimed Cacace indicated his involvement in the murder of NYPD officer Ralph <unk> . 
 In June 2013 the U.S. Department of Justice filed a request to Judge Garaufis for a reduction of Massino 's sentence ; prosecutors cited both the impact of Massino 's unprecedented cooperation and his failing health as reasons for a reduction of his sentence . Garaufis granted their request on July 10 , <unk> Massino to time served and supervised release for the remainder of his life .
