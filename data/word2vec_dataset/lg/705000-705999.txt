 IGN contributor Robert Canning reported that " Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter " was a " stellar episode that was hitting all the right beats " , and commented that " [ e ] ven the tired , formulaic structure of Jack 's two women scenario was given some great new lines " from Fey and Cannon , who developed the script . He opined that if the episode centered only around Jack 's two women dilemma it " would have been just fine . " Canning appreciated Elizabeth Banks ' and Julianne Moore 's appearances , writing that the two " exhibited the charms that have made them welcome additions to this season " . In conclusion , Canning gave the episode a 9 @.@ 2 out of 10 rating . Jane Boursaw of AOL 's TV Squad said that the Toofer story was " funny , without being ( too ) offensive . " The A.V. Club 's Nathan Rabin said that he enjoyed " just about every minute " of this episode , and praised Liz 's speech citing it as the " crowning moment " from " Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter " . Rabin also liked the Toofer quitting storyline writing that it " could easily have gone nowhere but the show made it both funny and surprisingly thoughtful by using it as a springboard to discuss Affirmative Action and our society 's defiantly uneven playing field . " Time contributor James Poniewozik noted that this episode was stronger than " Khonani " , which aired the same day of the week as this episode . Sean Gandert of Paste wrote that Toofer 's plot was not " given more than a few minutes of screen time [ but ] it also doesn 't wear out its welcome ... The show doesn 't address race , gender , or affirmative action in a particularly enlightened manner , but who cares , it 's funny . " TV Guide 's Adam Mersel wrote that he found the most enjoyment in Liz 's story , writing that he found it " endearing " . In regards to Jack 's plot , Mersel said that Jack is able to play off Nancy and Avery so well that " I am going back and forth on whether or not to scold the NBC boss or give him a pat on the back . Avery and Nancy both have their shining moments , but I feel that he must choose quite soon , or he will be loosing [ sic ] both . " 
 Will Ferrell 's ten second cameo was well @-@ received , with Canning concluding , " ... the cherry on the top was discovering that The Girlie Show was only picked up to offset the complaints raised by the series Bitch Hunter . The ten @-@ second clip of this series , with a cameo from Will Ferrell , was phenomenal and I hope the web will soon produce more clips . " 
 = MS West Grama = 
 MS West Grama , sometimes spelled as West <unk> , was a diesel @-@ powered cargo ship of the United States Maritime Commission ( USMC ) that was sunk as part of the " gooseberry " breakwater off Utah Beach during the Normandy invasion . Prior to her diesel conversion , she was known as SS West Grama . In 1919 , she was briefly taken up by the United States Navy under the name USS West Grama ( ID @-@ <unk> ) . 
 SS West Grama was built as a steam @-@ powered cargo ship in 1918 for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) , a predecessor of the USMC . She was part of the West boats , a series of steel @-@ hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort , and was the 9th ship built at Los Angeles Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company in San Pedro , California . She was commissioned into the Naval Overseas Transportation Service ( NOTS ) of the United States Navy as USS West Grama ( ID @-@ <unk> ) in January 1919 . She became the first American @-@ flagged vessel to enter Bulgarian waters when she delivered a load of wheat flour to Varna in early 1919 . After her one overseas trip for the Navy , she was decommissioned in June 1919 and returned to the USSB . 
 SS West Grama sailed between Genoa and New York early in her civilian career . In 1927 , West Grama was outfitted with a diesel engine that replaced her original steam engine as part of a pilot program by the USSB . After her conversion , she sailed primarily between East Coast ports and South America . By the late 1930s , she had been laid up , but was reactivated for merchant service during World War II . She sailed primarily in the Caribbean until March 1944 when she sailed from the United States for the final time . She was scuttled in June as part of the " gooseberry " breakwater off Omaha Beach during the Normandy invasion , earning a battle star in the process .

 The West ships were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the west coast of the United States for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) for emergency use during World War I. All were given names that began with the word West , like West Grama , the ninth of some 40 West ships built by the Los Angeles Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company of Los Angeles . West Grama ( Los Angeles Shipbuilding yard number 9 ) was one of three Los Angeles Shipbuilding ships launched on 4 July 1918 , and was completed in December . 
 West Grama was 5 @,@ 445 gross register tons ( GRT ) , and was 410 feet 1 inch ( 124 @.@ 99 m ) long ( between perpendiculars ) and 54 feet 6 inches ( 16 @.@ 61 m ) abeam . She had a steel hull that displaced 12 @,@ 225 t with a mean draft of 24 feet 2 inches ( 7 @.@ 37 m ) . Her hold was 29 feet 9 inches ( 9 @.@ 07 m ) deep and she had a deadweight tonnage of 8 @,@ 028 DWT . West Grama 's power plant , as built , consisted of a single triple @-@ expansion steam engine driving a single screw propeller , which moved the ship at up to 10 @.@ 5 knots ( 19 @.@ 4 km / h ) . 
 = = Military career = = 
 West Grama was taken over by the U.S. Navy on 9 January 1919 at San Pedro , California , and was commissioned into the Naval Overseas Transportation Service ( NOTS ) the same day with Lieutenant Commander Eugene McCarthy , USNRF , in command . West Grama headed north to San Francisco to take on a load of wheat flour for delivery to Europe . After undergoing boiler repairs at Union Iron Works , she departed San Francisco for Norfolk , Virginia , on 28 January . West Grama transited the Panama Canal on 14 February and got underway again on 19 February , after a four @-@ day layover in the Canal Zone . 
 On 25 February , a half @-@ submerged ship was spotted some 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) east @-@ northeast of Nassau , Bahamas . Upon investigation , it was determined to be the wreck of the American schooner Nettie Shipman , but , with no signs of life aboard the hulk , West Grama continued on to Virginia , where she arrived three days later . 
 After general repairs and fuel replenishment , West Grama got underway for the Mediterranean on 13 March . Touching at Gibraltar , she next headed to Constantinople , Turkey , to unload part of her cargo , and then proceeded into the Black Sea . She arrived at Varna , Bulgaria , to unload the remainder of the flour , and , in the process , became the first American @-@ flagged vessel to enter Bulgarian waters . After departure from Varna , West Grama returned to the United States via Gibraltar . She carried a mixed load of 13 depth charges and 218 long tons ( 221 t ) of general cargo . In early June , during her return voyage , West Grama was disabled by some unspecified problem while west of Bermuda . The U.S. Navy cargo ship Eastport , en route from New Orleans to Cardiff , assisted West Grama , and the Navy dispatched the icebreaker <unk> from Boston to aid West Grama . It 's not known what assistance was provided or if West Grama was even able to proceed on her own , but she arrived at Norfolk on 11 June . Five days later , West Grama was decommissioned and returned to the USSB for civilian service . 
 = = Civilian career = = 
 After her return to the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) , West Grama sailed on a Genoa – Gibraltar – New York route through 1920 . In April 1920 , West Grama carried some 52 passengers from Genoa and Gibraltar to New York . There is no mention in sources of the ship 's activities over the next seven years , but in June 1927 , the Los Angeles Times reported that West Grama had been selected for a $ 400 @,@ 000 conversion from steam @-@ power to diesel @-@ power . By late November , the conversion , undergoing at the Fore River Shipyard near Boston , was nearly complete . The new engine was a McIntosh & Seymour double @-@ acting diesel , the first of its type built in America . On 8 December , during successful sea trials of West Grama 's new diesel power plant , a malfunction in a steam boiler used to heat the crew quarters caused minor damage to the ship . 
 Allocated to the American Republics Line for service to the east coast of South America , West Grama sailed for Buenos Aires , Argentina , where she had arrived by late January 1928 , and back to New York by late March . In October 1929 , West Grama was reportedly assigned to the new Pacific – South Africa Line by the USSB , an around @-@ the @-@ world venture under the management of J. J. Moore & Company . The Pacific – South Africa Line — the world 's only all @-@ diesel around @-@ the @-@ world service , as described by the Los Angeles Times — sailed from Los Angeles to South Africa via the Straits of Magellan , across the Indian Ocean to Japan and China , across the Pacific to San Francisco , and back to Los Angeles . It 's not clear how long , if at all , West Grama sailed for this line . In July 1929 , a report in The New York Times shows that West Grama was still in South American service , sailing to Santos , Brazil . 
 Sources are not clear as to all of West Grama 's movements over the next years . Hints can be gleaned from contemporary news accounts . In March 1930 , the Los Angeles Times reported that West Grama was en route from Balboa to San Francisco . The New York Times reported West Grama 's arrival from Portland , Oregon in September , her departure for Fremantle , Western Australia in October 1933 , and her arrival from Baltimore in March the following year . After these mentions , West Grama disappears from contemporary news accounts , and by 1939 , West Grama had been laid up in a reserve fleet .

 In December 1940 , the United States Maritime Commission ( USMC ) , a successor to the USSB , announced that it was seeking bids for the sale of 24 ships from its reserve fleet , including West Grama . In January 1941 , the USMC announced that a consortium of Commonwealth shipping lines had been the high bidders for 19 of the 20 ships still offered . The highest bid for West Grama was $ 80 @,@ 000 , but it is not clear if the bid was , in fact , accepted ; by November , West Grama was sailing between Antofagasta , Chile , and New York , but remained under the American flag . From July 1942 through February 1944 , West Grama sailed between the United States and Caribbean ports , frequently traveling in convoys . The ship 's recorded movements show her calling at Cristóbal , Guantánamo Bay , Trinidad , Key West , and Pilottown , Louisiana . In mid @-@ February 1944 , West Grama sailed from Key West to New York , and from there , on to Boston . 
 = = Final voyage = = 
 West Grama had been selected to become one of the blockships for the Allied invasion of France , then in the planning stages . Though the specific modifications performed on West Grama are not revealed in sources , modifications for other ships do appear . In November 1944 , The Christian Science Monitor reported that blockships dispatched from Boston , like West Grama , had been loaded with " tons of sand and cement " and had been rigged with explosive charges before departing the port . Further , existing antiaircraft weapons had been moved higher up on the ship and supplemented by additional guns . An account by Cesar Poropat , chief engineer aboard West Honaker , another blockship dispatched from Boston , mentions that shipyard workers proceeded to cut holes in " strategic places " . 
 West Grama departed Boston on 25 March and arrived at Halifax two days later . Departing from that port on 29 March , she sailed in Convoy SC @-@ 156 and arrived at Barry Roads on 13 April , and by 7 May , she had arrived at Methil . West Grama 's whereabouts and movements through early June are not recorded . Other ships that had been selected as blockships assembled in a " corncob " fleet at Oban , though it 's not clear if West Grama did or not . The " corncob " fleet was the group of ships intended to be sunk to form the " gooseberries " , shallow @-@ water artificial harbors for landing craft . Poropat reports that once the ship crews were told of their mission while anchored at Oban , they were not permitted to leave the ships . 
 Three " corncob " convoys , consisting of what one author called the " dregs of the North Atlantic shipping pool " , departed from Poole and reached the Normandy beachhead the next day , shortly after the D @-@ Day landings . Poropat reports that the corncob ships traveled under cover of darkness and , stripped of all unnecessary equipment , carried no radios , having only a signal lamp ( with a spare bulb ) for communication . Once at the designated location , the ships were put into position and scuttled over the next days , under heavy German artillery fire . Naval Armed Guardsmen manned the guns on all the gooseberry ships to protect against frequent German air attacks All the while , harbor pilots — about half of the New York Bar Pilots Association , according to one source — carefully positioned the ships . West Grama was sunk off Omaha Beach on 8 June , though she continued to serve as an antiaircraft platform manned by Navy gun crews . On 9 June , West Grama 's gunners fired 19 times and were credited with assisting in the downing one German airplane ; only one of West Grama 's Navy gunners was wounded during the attack . On 14 June , West Grama escaped serious damage when a bomb landed near the ship . By the time her Naval Armed Guardsmen were replaced by Army crews on 18 June , they had received credit for a second assist , and had been awarded a battle star for their participation in the Normandy Landings . 
 = American game show winnings records = 
 In the United States , a game show is a type of radio , television , or internet program in which contestants , television personalities or celebrities , sometimes as part of a team , play a game which involves answering questions or solving puzzles , usually for money and / or prizes . Since the genre began , many shows have offered prizes of large sums of money to contestants ; Teddy Nadler set the original monetary winnings record of $ 264 @,@ 000 during his appearance on The $ 64 @,@ 000 Challenge in 1957 . 
 Nadler was not surpassed until 1980 , when Thom McKee won $ 312 @,@ 700 on Tic @-@ Tac @-@ Dough . In 1999 , John Carpenter won $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire , becoming the first person to win a seven @-@ figure prize on an American game show . Since then , many players have gone on to win that amount and even surpassed it . As of 2015 , Brad Rutter is the highest @-@ earning American game show contestant of all time , having accumulated a total of $ 4 @,@ 555 @,@ 102 . He succeeded Ken Jennings as the highest @-@ earning contestant by virtue of his victory on May 16 , 2014 , in the Jeopardy ! Battle of the Decades tournament .

 The single day record for shows in daytime television was set by Michael Larson in 1984 , who won $ 110 @,@ 237 ( equivalent to $ 251 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) on Press Your Luck . Larson achieved his record by memorizing the show 's board patterns . He repeatedly hit the board 's squares that awarded contestants money and an additional spin . That spin would in turn replace the spin he had just used , effectively allowing him to spin the board in the second round as long as wanted . Because of this , his game had to be split into two episodes ( which aired June 8 and June 11 , 1984 ) , as his turn caused the game to go well over the show 's half @-@ hour allotted time . In 2003 , Game Show Network produced a documentary about the event . 
 In 2006 , Larson was succeeded by <unk> <unk> @-@ Sadowski , who set the record by winning $ 147 @,@ 517 on the 35th season premiere of The Price Is Right in 2006 . <unk> @-@ Sadowski 's record has since been broken by Sheree Heil from her appearance on The Price Is Right in 2013 .

 While the 1950s had multiple big winners ( Herb Stempel and Charles Van Doren of Twenty One being two of the most notable ) , Teddy Nadler set the overall record during the 1956 – 57 television season , who set a record that would stand for the next two decades by winning $ 264 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 2 @,@ 298 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) on The $ 64 @,@ 000 Challenge . 
 It was not until 1980 that Nadler 's record fell . During the summer of that year , a U.S. Naval officer named Thom McKee began a run on Tic @-@ Tac @-@ Dough that carried over into the following season . Since champions on Tic Tac Dough played until they were defeated , and games on the show could end in ties with the pot carrying over , McKee was able to keep building his total as long as he kept playing and winning . McKee won $ 312 @,@ 700 ( equivalent to $ 898 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) in cash and prizes in 43 games , which included eight cars ( on Tic Tac Dough and its sister show , The Joker 's Wild , a contestant automatically won a car after every fifth game they won ) . 
 While McKee was the biggest solo winner until 1999 , nine couples on The $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 Chance of a Lifetime won the show 's top prize of $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 2 @,@ 083 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) , in a combination of prizes and a long @-@ term annuity , during the show 's run in syndication from January 1986 to September 1987 . However , this program had no solo players . 
 In 1999 , McKee was passed by Michael Shutterly , who was the biggest winner in the first airing of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in the United States . Shutterly was the first contestant on the show to get to the 15th and final question , but elected to walk instead with $ 500 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 710 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) , which made him the biggest winner in American game show history at the time . Shutterly had previously won $ 49 @,@ 200 as a 4 day champion on Jeopardy ! in 1988 , making his career winnings total $ 549 @,@ 200 . 
 = = = 1999 – present = = = 
 During the second season of Millionaire in the United States , the show crowned its first million @-@ dollar winner . On November 19 , 1999 , John Carpenter won the show 's top prize without using any lifelines , save for a phone call on the final question to tell his father he was going to win the million dollars . After Carpenter answered the final question , which concerned Richard Nixon 's appearance on Laugh @-@ In in 1968 , host Regis Philbin proclaimed Carpenter the show 's ( and worldwide format 's ) first top prize winner . 
 Carpenter 's record remained intact until the following year . In early 2000 , Rahim Oberholtzer , a contestant on the revival of Twenty One , won four games in his appearances on the show , along with $ 120 @,@ 000 in the show 's " Perfect 21 " bonus round , for a total of $ 1 @,@ 120 @,@ 000 . For surpassing Carpenter 's mark , host Maury Povich proclaimed Oberholtzer " the TV Game Show King . " 
 Late in its run , the Fox show Greed brought back some of its previous winners to try for an extra $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . Curtis Warren , who was part of the first team to win $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 on the show ( of which his share was $ 400 @,@ 000 , plus $ 10 @,@ 000 for winning a terminator round ) , was one of the contestants brought back to do so on February 11 , 2000 . Warren was given a question about TV shows that had been made into movies , with 8 choices ( of which he had to identify the four correct answers ) . He successfully did so , giving himself $ 1 @,@ 410 @,@ 000 and the record for the time being . 
 Warren 's record was even shorter lived than Oberholtzer 's had been , lasting only four days . Three days before Warren 's win , David Legler , who also appeared on NBC 's Twenty One , began a run as champion on the show . Four days after Warren 's win , the run continued , with Legler having earned a grand total of $ 1 @,@ 765 @,@ 000 in six wins to surpass Warren 's record and become the third contestant in two months to top $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 on a game show . 
 Legler held the record for well over a year . As 2000 ended and 2001 began , the producers of Millionaire decided that it had been too long ( 71 games over a five @-@ month period ) since their top prize had been won , and instituted an accumulating jackpot which added $ 10 @,@ 000 to the grand prize amount for each game it was not won . Kevin Olmstead claimed the top prize on April 10 , 2001 , winning a jackpot of $ 2 @,@ 180 @,@ 000 . Olmstead became the first contestant to top $ 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in total winnings on a game show and supplanted Legler as the all @-@ time leader . Olmstead has previously been a 2 day champion on Jeopardy ! in 1994 , winning $ 25 @,@ 901 there , making his career total $ 2 @,@ 205 @,@ 901 . 
 In 2004 , ABC launched an ultra high @-@ stakes version of Millionaire entitled Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire , with a $ 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 top prize . Two separate Super Millionaire series aired , one in February and one in May of that year . However , despite the higher stakes and the potential for someone to top the all @-@ time record for winnings , the largest prize awarded was $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 won by Robert Essig . 
 One week after Super Millionaire came to an end , Ken Jennings of Salt Lake City , Utah , became the new champion on Jeopardy ! The episode , broadcast on June 2 , 2004 , was the first in a long winning streak for the software engineer , made possible due to a change at the beginning of that season ( the show 's twentieth on air in syndication ) , eliminating the longstanding rule limiting consecutive appearances for a champion to five . With no limit to his appearances , Jennings began to break many game show records . As his streak continued deeper into the 21st season , Jennings was inching closer and closer to Olmstead 's record . Jennings topped Olmstead 's Millionaire winnings with his 65th consecutive win , finishing the day with $ 45 @,@ 099 and a new cumulative total of $ 2 @,@ 197 @,@ 000 , while Olmstead 's career winnings ( counting his Jeopardy wins ) were toppled in Jennings ' 66th game . 
 Jennings won nine more games before his streak came to an end on November 30 , 2004 . He had extended his record total to $ 2 @,@ 520 @,@ 700 at the time of his defeat , after which he was awarded an additional $ 2 @,@ 000 for finishing in second place per Jeopardy ! rules . Shortly after Jennings ' defeat , Jeopardy ! decided to see how he would fare in tournament play . On February 9 , 2005 , the show launched its Ultimate Tournament of Champions , inviting back 144 other past champions to compete over the next three months in a five @-@ round single @-@ elimination tournament with a $ 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 grand prize . The field included the highest @-@ winning five @-@ time champions and winners of some previous tournaments , though not all invitees were able to participate . Jennings received a bye into the finals of the tournament , where he faced semi @-@ final winners Jerome Vered and Brad Rutter in a three @-@ game , cumulative total match . Vered had set a single @-@ day scoring record during his appearance on the show in 1992 , while Rutter had won the 2001 Tournament of Champions and the 2002 Million Dollar Masters tournament and was the show 's highest @-@ earning contestant of all @-@ time before Jennings . 
 In the tournament 's three @-@ day final , Rutter defeated Jennings and Vered to win the tournament and $ 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 , and in the process he supplanted Jennings as the winningest all time American game show contestant . Including the $ 1 @.@ 18 million he had won in his previous Jeopardy ! appearances ( five regular season games , a Tournament of Champions win , the Million Dollar Masters win , and three matches in the earlier rounds of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions ) , Rutter 's total stood at $ 3 @,@ 255 @,@ 102 , while Jennings was now second with $ 3 @,@ 022 @,@ 700 having gained an additional $ 500 @,@ 000 for his second @-@ place finish in the tournament . 
 Jennings slowly began to chip away at Rutter 's record , first by winning $ 714 @.@ 29 in 2006 as part of the Mob on NBC 's 1 vs. 100 . A year later , Jennings won the Grand Slam tournament on Game Show Network and the $ 100 @,@ 000 top prize by defeating Ogi <unk> in the final round . Finally , on October 10 , 2008 , Jennings passed Rutter by winning $ 500 @,@ 000 on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader ? . He extended the record by winning $ 300 @,@ 000 in The IBM Challenge , where he and Rutter took on IBM supercomputer Watson in a special 2011 Jeopardy ! event . Rutter won $ 200 @,@ 000 in the challenge , in which both he and Jennings pledged half of their winnings to charity . He then added $ 100 @,@ 000 more later in 2011 when he appeared on Million Dollar Mind Game , raising his total to $ 3 @,@ 555 @,@ 102 , second only to Jennings ' $ 3 @,@ 923 @,@ 414 @.@ 29 . 
 In 2014 , Jennings and Rutter were both invited to play in the Jeopardy ! Battle of the Decades , a tournament conducted by the producers of Jeopardy ! to celebrate its thirtieth season in syndication . Both men advanced to the two @-@ day tournament final with Roger Craig filling the third position . Needing a win to reclaim his record , Rutter took the top prize in the tournament after Jennings , who needed to answer the second day 's Final Jeopardy clue correctly to win ( after making a sufficient wager ) , failed to do so . Rutter won the top prize of $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 while Jennings won the $ 100 @,@ 000 second prize . 
 Jennings later appeared on Millionaire in November 2014 . Winning the top prize was the only way he could have reclaimed the record from Rutter ; however , Jennings finished with only $ 100 @,@ 000 , leaving him in second place .

 = Tesco bomb campaign = 
 The Tesco bomb campaign was an attempted extortion against British supermarket chain Tesco which started in Bournemouth , Dorset , in August 2000 and led to one of the largest and most secretive operations ever undertaken by Dorset Police . During the campaign , a blackmailer identified by the pseudonym " Sally " sent letters to Tesco stores threatening to harm customers if his demands — for Clubcards , modified so that the holder could withdraw cash from automated teller machines — were not met . 
 Several months after the threat first came to light , " Sally " sent out several letter bombs , one of which was received and exploded in the face of the householder , causing her shock and minor injuries , while the Royal Mail intercepted several other packages , which had been held up because insufficient stamps had been put on them . In October 2000 , " Sally " threatened to use pipe bombs against Tesco customers and the threat was taken seriously enough that Tesco began the production of the modified Clubcards , but were unable to produce the required number before the deadline set by the blackmailer . In November , " Sally " claimed to have placed a pipe bomb in a garden in the Ferndown area of Dorset . No bomb was found . 
 Police eventually mounted a surveillance operation on the postbox to which several of the extortion letters had been traced and identified " Sally " as Robert Edward Dyer . Dyer was arrested in February 2001 , over six months since the beginning of the extortion attempt , and charged with several offences , including nine counts of blackmail and one of common assault , of which he was found guilty in May 2001 . He was sentenced to 16 @-@ years imprisonment on 12 June 2001 , later reduced to 12 on appeal . A number of similar extortion attempts against supermarket chains and other businesses and subsequent attacks on Tesco have since been compared to Dyer 's campaign by the media . 
 = = Beginnings = = 
 The campaign began in August 2000 , when John Purnell , director of security for Tesco , the United Kingdom 's largest supermarket chain , was telephoned by a newsagent in Bournemouth , Dorset , who had discovered a copy of an extortion letter left on his shop 's photocopier . The letter demanded that Tesco give away Clubcards , modified for use in cash machines , in the Bournemouth Daily Echo . Over the following days , Dorset Police received two other letters , threatening to send bombs to Tesco customers if the demands were not met . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 The police investigation into the campaign , codenamed Operation Hornbill , was one of the most secretive ever undertaken by Dorset Police and one of the largest in British policing history . After receiving the second letter , which had been damaged by fire , police made enquiries with the Royal Mail and discovered that a fire had been reported in a postbox on Bradpole Road , Bournemouth , leading to speculation that " Sally " — the alias by which all the letters were signed — had changed his mind and attempted to destroy the letter . They received a third letter on 29 August 2000 , in which " Sally " claimed to have prepared letter bombs to send to Tesco 's customers . 
 After receiving the third letter , the police attempted to communicate with " Sally " by covertly taking out a classified advert in the Bournemouth Daily Echo to buy more time . After receiving no response in three weeks , the senior investigating officer , Detective Superintendent Phil James convened a meeting with other senior officers from across the United Kingdom to assess the threat posed . 
 = = Bombings = = 
 During James ' meeting , he was informed that a letter bomb had exploded in a suburb of Bournemouth . In a documentary about the investigation in 2009 , James said " There was a knock at the door and I was told by one of my officers that an incendiary device had just gone off . The atmosphere of the meeting changed . Clearly there was a risk and the threat was very real " . Jean Evans , the woman who opened the letter bomb , was taken to hospital with minor injuries and a bomb disposal team from the British Army was despatched to the scene . The device had used a party popper to detonate gunpowder inside the envelope . Immediately after the first letter bomb , Dorset Police alerted Royal Mail to look out for similar packages and several were found in a sorting office , having been delayed because insufficient stamps had been placed on them , and defused by the Army . A further seven of the packages were delivered to the homes of Tesco customers . Following the spate of letter bombs , the Army 's bomb disposal team was stationed in Bournemouth — something that only usually happens when political party conferences are held in the town — and placed on stand @-@ by . 
 Another threatening letter was sent in October , threatening to attack Tesco customers with pipe bombs if the demands were not met . The letter contained a cipher which allowed the police to communicate with " Sally " in code through cryptic adverts in the Bournemouth Daily Echo . James contacted the editor of the Echo and the police were allowed to place the messages in the Echo , disguised as Mensa puzzles and made to look like <unk> . By this time , the police had narrowed the focus of their investigation on a square @-@ mile area of Bournemouth and James became convinced that they would find " Sally " through the postbox on Bradpole Road , through which the fire @-@ damaged letter had passed in August . The box was placed under surveillance and , eventually , the October letter was traced back to that box . The footage from the surveillance operation was reviewed , but the image was of poor quality . 
 In November 2000 , " Sally " lost patience and sent a letter in which he said he would place a pipe bomb in the garden of a Tesco customer if his demands were not met , prompting the police to seriously consider producing the modified Clubcards . They discovered that they could not produce sufficient cards by 12 December , the deadline " Sally " had set . Approximately 100 @,@ 000 <unk> , modified for use in ATMs , were eventually produced , but none were distributed . At the end of November , " Sally " sent another letter , telling the police that he had planted a bomb in a garden in the Ferndown area , giving a grid reference which included over 500 houses . The claim prompted the mobilisation of hundreds of police officers to the area , but no bomb was found .

 The police received another letter from " Sally " on 7 December . Once again , the letter was traced back to the Bradpole road postbox , where the surveillance operation had continued . The operation had captured good @-@ quality footage of all the users of the postbox that day , but , as it was close to Christmas , the postbox was busier than normal , with 172 items posted by 38 people . Royal Mail regulations meant that detectives could not open or delay the letters , so they made enquiries with the recipients to identify the senders . They eventually managed to identify all but a small number of the senders . 
 On 17 February 2001 — over six months after the receipt of the first demand and three months since the last letter from " Sally " — the police made a major breakthrough . Detective Constable Alan Swanton , a junior detective on the case , spotted one of the people caught by the surveillance of the postbox who had yet to be identified . The man was carrying a fuel container , which Swanton believed had come from a nearby filling station . Officers obtained CCTV footage from the filling station , where their suspect had paid by cheque , and identified the man as Robert Edward Dyer . 
 Dyer , who , at the time , was a 51 @-@ year @-@ old widower and unsuccessful businessman living with his two teenage daughters , was placed under surveillance . The surveillance operation did not yield any results , so the police decided to confront Dyer and visited him at his home on 19 February , where they found an extortion note on his computer and cryptic notes in his handwriting . Dyer was arrested and interviewed . The police later intercepted the final letter from " Sally " , which surveillance footage showed Dyer posting the day before he was arrested and which was an exact match to the letter found on Dyer 's computer . Detective Superintendent James later revealed that Dyer " was an individual in desperate need of money and believing that Tesco was the answer to all his problems . " 
 = = Conviction = = 
 Dyer was charged and , in May 2001 , pleaded guilty on nine counts of blackmail , as well as a sole count of common assault against Jean Evans , the woman who opened the letter bomb . On 12 June 2001 , he was sentenced to 16 @-@ years imprisonment by a judge at Dorchester Crown Court . The sentence was reduced to 12 @-@ years imprisonment on appeal and Dyer was released from prison in 2007 . 
 During the trial , it emerged that Dyer had worn gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints on the letters and used water to stick the stamps rather than licking them , but that he had made errors , such as leaving a copy of an extortion demand on a newsagent 's photocopier . Although Dyer initially demanded only £ 200 @,@ 000 , Tesco would have lost an estimated £ 5 million had they complied with Dyer 's demand to place cards in every copy of the Bournemouth Echo . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The investigation was one of the largest and most secretive that had ever been undertaken by Dorset Police . The campaign was compared in the media to other similar extortion attempts against Tesco and other British businesses . Dyer got inspiration for the campaign from an article he read about Rodney <unk> , who attempted to extort £ 4 million from H.J. Heinz Company by spiking jars of baby food . <unk> was sentenced to 17 @-@ years imprisonment in 1990 . Dyer 's campaign was also compared to that of Edgar Pearce , dubbed the " Mardi Gras bomber " by the media . Over three years , Pearce had used bombs in an attempt to extort money from Barclays Bank and Sainsbury 's supermarkets . He was sentenced to 21 @-@ years imprisonment in 1999 . Later incidents have also been compared to Dyer 's campaign , including another against Tesco in 2007 . 
 A documentary about the campaign was made in 2009 and broadcast by ITV . The documentary featured interviews with Neal Butterworth , then @-@ editor of the Bournemouth Daily Echo and DSI James , the police officer who led the investigation . 
 = Magnetosphere of Jupiter = 
 The magnetosphere of Jupiter is the cavity created in the solar wind by the planet 's magnetic field . Extending up to seven million kilometers in the Sun 's direction and almost to the orbit of Saturn in the opposite direction , Jupiter 's magnetosphere is the largest and most powerful of any planetary magnetosphere in the Solar System , and by volume the largest known continuous structure in the Solar System after the heliosphere . Wider and flatter than the Earth 's magnetosphere , Jupiter 's is stronger by an order of magnitude , while its magnetic moment is roughly 18 @,@ 000 times larger . The existence of Jupiter 's magnetic field was first inferred from observations of radio emissions at the end of the 1950s and was directly observed by the Pioneer 10 spacecraft in 1973 . 
 Jupiter 's internal magnetic field is generated by electrical currents in the planet 's outer core , which is composed of liquid metallic hydrogen . Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter 's moon Io eject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into space , forming a large torus around the planet . Jupiter 's magnetic field forces the torus to rotate with the same angular velocity and direction as the planet . The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with plasma , in the process stretching it into a pancake @-@ like structure called a magnetodisk . In effect , Jupiter 's magnetosphere is shaped by Io 's plasma and its own rotation , rather than by the solar wind like Earth 's magnetosphere . Strong currents in the magnetosphere generate permanent aurorae around the planet 's poles and intense variable radio emissions , which means that Jupiter can be thought of as a very weak radio pulsar . Jupiter 's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum , including infrared , visible , ultraviolet and soft X @-@ rays . 
 The action of the magnetosphere traps and accelerates particles , producing intense belts of radiation similar to Earth 's Van Allen belts , but thousands of times stronger . The interaction of energetic particles with the surfaces of Jupiter 's largest moons markedly affects their chemical and physical properties . Those same particles also affect and are affected by the motions of the particles within Jupiter 's tenuous planetary ring system . Radiation belts present a significant hazard for spacecraft and potentially to human space travellers . 
 = = Structure = = 
 Jupiter 's magnetosphere is a complex structure comprising a bow shock , magnetosheath , magnetopause , magnetotail , magnetodisk , and other components . The magnetic field around Jupiter emanates from a number of different sources , including fluid circulation at the planet 's core ( the internal field ) , electrical currents in the plasma surrounding Jupiter and the currents flowing at the boundary of the planet 's magnetosphere . The magnetosphere is embedded within the plasma of the solar wind , which carries the interplanetary magnetic field . 
 = = = Internal magnetic field = = = 
 The bulk of Jupiter 's magnetic field , like Earth 's , is generated by an internal dynamo supported by the circulation of a conducting fluid in its outer core . But whereas Earth 's core is made of molten iron and nickel , Jupiter 's is composed of metallic hydrogen . As with Earth 's , Jupiter 's magnetic field is mostly a dipole , with north and south magnetic poles at the ends of a single magnetic axis . However , on Jupiter the north pole of the dipole is located in the planet 's northern hemisphere and the south pole of the dipole lies in its southern hemisphere , opposite to the Earth , whose north pole lies in the southern hemisphere and south pole lies in the northern hemisphere . Jupiter 's field also has quadrupole , <unk> and higher components , though they are less than one tenth as strong as the dipole component . 
 The dipole is tilted roughly 10 ° from Jupiter 's axis of rotation ; the tilt is similar to that of the Earth ( 11 @.@ 3 ° ) . Its equatorial field strength is about 428 μT ( 4 @.@ 28 G ) , which corresponds to a dipole magnetic moment of about 1 @.@ 56 × 1020 T · m3 . This makes Jupiter 's magnetic field 10 times stronger than Earth 's , and its magnetic moment about 18 @,@ 000 times larger . Jupiter 's magnetic field rotates at the same speed as the region below its atmosphere , with a period of 9 h 55 m . No changes in its strength or structure have been observed since the first measurements were taken by the Pioneer spacecraft in the mid @-@ 1970s . 
 = = = Size and shape = = = 
 Jupiter 's internal magnetic field prevents the solar wind , a stream of ionized particles emitted by the Sun , from interacting directly with its atmosphere , and instead diverts it away from the planet , effectively creating a cavity in the solar wind flow , called a magnetosphere , composed of a plasma different from that of the solar wind . The Jovian ( i.e. pertaining to Jupiter ) magnetosphere is so large that the Sun and its visible corona would fit inside it with room to spare . If one could see it from Earth , it would appear five times larger than the full moon in the sky despite being nearly 1700 times farther away . 
 As with Earth 's magnetosphere , the boundary separating the denser and colder solar wind 's plasma from the hotter and less dense one within Jupiter 's magnetosphere is called the magnetopause . The distance from the magnetopause to the center of the planet is from 45 to 100 RJ ( where RJ = 71 @,@ 492 km is the radius of Jupiter ) at the subsolar point — the unfixed point on the surface at which the Sun would appear directly overhead to an observer . The position of the magnetopause depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind , which in turn depends on solar activity . In front of the magnetopause ( at a distance from 80 to 130 RJ from the planet 's center ) lies the bow shock , a wake @-@ like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere . The region between the bow shock and magnetopause is called the magnetosheath . 
 At the opposite side of the planet , the solar wind stretches Jupiter 's magnetic field lines into a long , trailing magnetotail , which sometimes extends well beyond the orbit of Saturn . The structure of Jupiter 's magnetotail is similar to Earth 's . It consists of two lobes ( blue areas in the figure ) , with the magnetic field in the southern lobe pointing toward Jupiter , and that in the northern lobe pointing away from it . The lobes are separated by a thin layer of plasma called the tail current sheet ( orange layer in the middle ) . Like Earth 's , the Jovian tail is a channel through which solar plasma enters the inner regions of the magnetosphere , where it is heated and forms the radiation belts at distances closer than 10 RJ from Jupiter . 
 The shape of Jupiter 's magnetosphere described above is sustained by the neutral sheet current ( also known as the magnetotail current ) , which flows with Jupiter 's rotation through the tail plasma sheet , the tail currents , which flow against Jupiter 's rotation at the outer boundary of the magnetotail , and the magnetopause currents ( or Chapman @-@ Ferraro currents ) , which flow against rotation along the dayside magnetopause . These currents create the magnetic field that cancels the internal field outside the magnetosphere . They also interact substantially with the solar wind . 
 Jupiter 's magnetosphere is traditionally divided into three parts : the inner , middle and outer magnetosphere . The inner magnetosphere is located at distances closer than 10 RJ from the planet . The magnetic field within it remains approximately dipole , because contributions from the currents flowing in the magnetospheric equatorial plasma sheet are small . In the middle ( between 10 and 40 RJ ) and outer ( further than 40 RJ ) magnetospheres , the magnetic field is not a dipole , and is seriously disturbed by its interaction with the plasma sheet ( see magnetodisk below ) . 
 = = = Role of Io = = = 
 Although overall the shape of Jupiter 's magnetosphere resembles that of the Earth 's , closer to the planet its structure is very different . Jupiter 's volcanically active moon Io is a strong source of plasma in its own right , and loads Jupiter 's magnetosphere with as much as 1 @,@ 000 kg of new material every second . Strong volcanic eruptions on Io emit huge amounts of sulfur dioxide , a major part of which is dissociated into atoms and ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation , producing ions of sulfur and oxygen : S + , O + , S2 + and O2 + . These ions escape from the satellite 's atmosphere and form the Io plasma torus : a thick and relatively cool ring of plasma encircling Jupiter , located near Io 's orbit . The plasma temperature within the torus is 10 – 100 eV ( 100 @,@ 000 – 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 K ) , which is much lower than that of the particles in the radiation belts — 10 keV ( 100 million K ) . The plasma in the torus is forced into co @-@ rotation with Jupiter , meaning both share the same period of rotation . The Io torus fundamentally alters the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere . 
 As a result of several processes — diffusion and interchange instability being the main escape mechanisms — the plasma slowly leaks away from Jupiter . As the plasma moves further from the planet , the radial currents flowing within it gradually increase its velocity , maintaining co @-@ rotation . These radial currents are also the source of the magnetic field 's azimuthal component , which as a result bends back against the rotation . The particle number density of the plasma decreases from around 2 @,@ 000 cm − 3 in the Io torus to about 0 @.@ 2 cm − 3 at a distance of 35 RJ . In the middle magnetosphere , at distances greater than 20 RJ from Jupiter , co @-@ rotation gradually breaks down and the plasma begins to rotate more slowly than the planet . Eventually at the distances greater than 40 RJ ( in the outer magnetosphere ) this plasma escapes the magnetic field completely and leaves the magnetosphere through the magnetotail . As cold , dense plasma moves outward , it is replaced by hot , low @-@ density plasma ( temperature 20 keV ( 200 million K ) or higher ) moving from the outer magnetosphere . This plasma , adiabatically heated as it approaches Jupiter , forms the radiation belts in Jupiter 's inner magnetosphere . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 While Earth 's magnetic field is roughly teardrop @-@ shaped , Jupiter 's is flatter , more closely resembling a disk , and " wobbles " periodically about its axis . The main reasons for this disk @-@ like configuration are the centrifugal force from the co @-@ rotating plasma and thermal pressure of hot plasma , both of which act to stretch Jupiter 's magnetic field lines , forming a flattened pancake @-@ like structure , known as the magnetodisk , at the distances greater than 20 RJ from the planet . The magnetodisk has a thin current sheet at the middle plane , approximately near the magnetic equator . The magnetic field lines point away from Jupiter above the sheet and towards Jupiter below it . The load of plasma from Io greatly expands the size of the Jovian magnetosphere , because the magnetodisk creates an additional internal pressure which balances the pressure of the solar wind . In the absence of Io the distance from the planet to the magnetopause at the subsolar point would be no more than 42 RJ , whereas it is actually 75 RJ on average . 
 The configuration of the magnetodisk 's field is maintained by the azimuthal ring current ( not an analog of Earth 's ring current ) , which flows with rotation through the equatorial plasma sheet . The Lorentz force resulting from the interaction of this current with the planetary magnetic field creates a centripetal force , which keeps the co @-@ rotating plasma from escaping the planet . The total ring current in the equatorial current sheet is estimated at 90 – 160 million amperes . 
 = = Dynamics = = 
 = = = Co @-@ rotation and radial currents = = = 
 The main driver of Jupiter 's magnetosphere is the planet 's rotation . In this respect Jupiter is similar to a device called a <unk> generator . When Jupiter rotates , its ionosphere moves relatively to the dipole magnetic field of the planet . Because the dipole magnetic moment points in the direction of the rotation , the Lorentz force , which appears as a result of this motion , drives negatively charged electrons to the poles , while positively charged ions are pushed towards the equator . As a result , the poles become negatively charged and the regions closer to the equator become positively charged . Since the magnetosphere of Jupiter is filled with highly conductive plasma , the electrical circuit is closed through it . A current called the direct current flows along the magnetic field lines from the ionosphere to the equatorial plasma sheet . This current then flows radially away from the planet within the equatorial plasma sheet and finally returns to the planetary ionosphere from the outer reaches of the magnetosphere along the field lines connected to the poles . The currents that flow along the magnetic field lines are generally called field @-@ aligned or Birkeland currents . The radial current interacts with the planetary magnetic field , and the resulting Lorentz force accelerates the magnetospheric plasma in the direction of planetary rotation . This is the main mechanism that maintains co @-@ rotation of the plasma in Jupiter 's magnetosphere . 
 The current flowing from the ionosphere to the plasma sheet is especially strong when the corresponding part of the plasma sheet rotates slower than the planet . As mentioned above , co @-@ rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40 RJ from Jupiter . This region corresponds to the magnetodisk , where the magnetic field is highly stretched . The strong direct current flowing into the magnetodisk originates in a very limited latitudinal range of about 16 ± 1 ° from the Jovian magnetic poles . These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter 's main auroral ovals . ( See below . ) The return current flowing from the outer magnetosphere beyond 50 RJ enters the Jovian ionosphere near the poles , closing the electrical circuit . The total radial current in the Jovian magnetosphere is estimated at 60 million – 140 million amperes . 
 The acceleration of the plasma into the co @-@ rotation leads to the transfer of energy from the Jovian rotation to the kinetic energy of the plasma . In that sense , the Jovian magnetosphere is powered by the planet 's rotation , whereas the Earth 's magnetosphere is powered mainly by the solar wind . 
 = = = Interchange instability and reconnection = = = 
 The main problem encountered in deciphering the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere is the transport of heavy cold plasma from the Io torus at 6 RJ to the outer magnetosphere at distances of more than 50 RJ . The precise mechanism of this process is not known , but it is hypothesized to occur as a result of plasma diffusion due to interchange instability . The process is similar to the Rayleigh @-@ Taylor instability in hydrodynamics . In the case of the Jovian magnetosphere , centrifugal force plays the role of gravity ; the heavy liquid is the cold and dense Ionian ( i.e. pertaining to Io ) plasma , and the light liquid is the hot , much less dense plasma from the outer magnetosphere . The instability leads to an exchange between the outer and inner parts of the magnetosphere of flux tubes filled with plasma . The buoyant empty flux tubes move towards the planet , while pushing the heavy tubes , filled with the Ionian plasma , away from Jupiter . This interchange of flux tubes is a form of magnetospheric turbulence . 
 This highly hypothetical picture of the flux tube exchange was partly confirmed by the Galileo spacecraft , which detected regions of sharply reduced plasma density and increased field strength in the inner magnetosphere . These voids may correspond to the almost empty flux tubes arriving from the outer magnetosphere . In the middle magnetosphere , Galileo detected so @-@ called injection events , which occur when hot plasma from the outer magnetosphere impacts the magnetodisk , leading to increased flux of energetic particles and a strengthened magnetic field . No mechanism is yet known to explain the transport of cold plasma outward . 
 When flux tubes loaded with the cold Ionian plasma reach the outer magnetosphere , they go through a reconnection process , which separates the magnetic field from the plasma . The former returns to the inner magnetosphere in the form of flux tubes filled with hot and less dense plasma , while the latter are probably ejected down the magnetotail in the form of <unk> — large blobs of plasma . The reconnection processes may correspond to the global reconfiguration events also observed by the Galileo probe , which occurred regularly every 2 – 3 days . The reconfiguration events usually included rapid and chaotic variation of the magnetic field strength and direction , as well as abrupt changes in the motion of the plasma , which often stopped co @-@ rotating and began flowing outward . They were mainly observed in the dawn sector of the night magnetosphere . The plasma flowing down the tail along the open field lines is called the planetary wind . 
 The reconnection events are analogues to the magnetic <unk> in the Earth 's magnetosphere . The difference seems to be their respective energy sources : terrestrial <unk> involve storage of the solar wind 's energy in the magnetotail followed by its release through a reconnection event in the tail 's neutral current sheet . The latter also creates a <unk> which moves down the tail . Conversely , in Jupiter 's magnetosphere the rotational energy is stored in the magnetodisk and released when a <unk> separates from it . 
 = = = Influence of the solar wind = = = 
 Whereas the dynamics of Jovian magnetosphere mainly depend on internal sources of energy , the solar wind probably has a role as well , particularly as a source of high @-@ energy protons . The structure of the outer magnetosphere shows some features of a solar wind @-@ driven magnetosphere , including a significant dawn – dusk asymmetry . In particular , magnetic field lines in the dusk sector are bent in the opposite direction to those in the dawn sector . In addition , the dawn magnetosphere contains open field lines connecting to the magnetotail , whereas in the dusk magnetosphere , the field lines are closed . All these observations indicate that a solar wind driven reconnection process , known on Earth as the Dungey cycle , may also be taking place in the Jovian magnetosphere . 
 The extent of the solar wind 's influence on the dynamics of Jupiter 's magnetosphere is currently unknown ; however , it could be especially strong at times of elevated solar activity . The auroral radio , optical and X @-@ ray emissions , as well as synchrotron emissions from the radiation belts all show correlations with solar wind pressure , indicating that the solar wind may drive plasma circulation or modulate internal processes in the magnetosphere . 
 = = Emissions = = 
 = = = Aurorae = = = 
 Jupiter demonstrates bright , persistent aurorae around both poles . Unlike Earth 's aurorae , which are transient and only occur at times of heightened solar activity , Jupiter 's aurorae are permanent , though their intensity varies from day to day . They consist of three main components : the main ovals , which are bright , narrow ( less than 1000 km in width ) circular features located at approximately 16 ° from the magnetic poles ; the satellites ' auroral spots , which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting Jupiter 's ionosphere with those of its largest moons , and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals . Whereas the auroral emissions were detected in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to X @-@ rays ( up to 3 keV ) , they are brightest in the mid @-@ infrared ( wavelength 3 – 4 μm and 7 – 14 μm ) and deep ultraviolet spectral regions ( wavelength 80 – 180 nm ) . 
 The main ovals are the dominant part of the Jovian aurorae . They have stable shapes and locations , but their intensities are strongly modulated by the solar wind pressure — the stronger solar wind , the weaker the aurorae . As mentioned above , the main ovals are maintained by the strong influx of electrons accelerated by the electric potential drops between the magnetodisk plasma and the Jovian ionosphere . These electrons carry field aligned currents , which maintain the plasma 's co @-@ rotation in the magnetodisk . The potential drops develop because the sparse plasma outside the equatorial sheet can only carry a current of a limited strength without those currents . The precipitating electrons have energy in the range 10 – 100 keV and penetrate deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter , where they ionize and excite molecular hydrogen causing ultraviolet emission . The total energy input into the ionosphere is 10 – 100 TW . In addition , the currents flowing in the ionosphere heats it by the process known as Joule heating . This heating , which produces up to 300 TW of power , is responsible for the strong infrared radiation from the Jovian aurorae and partially for the heating of the thermosphere of Jupiter . 
 Spots were found to correspond to three Galilean moons : Io , Europa and Ganymede . They develop because the co @-@ rotation of the plasma is slowed in the vicinity of moons . The brightest spot belongs to Io , which is the main source of the plasma in the magnetosphere ( see above ) . The Ionian auroral spot is thought to be related to Alfvén currents flowing from the Jovian to Ionian ionosphere . Europa 's and Ganymede 's spots are much dimmer , because these moons are weak plasma sources , because of sublimation of the water ice from their surfaces . 
 Bright arcs and spots sporadically appear within the main ovals . These transient phenomena are thought to be related to interaction with the solar wind . The magnetic field lines in this region are believed to be open or to map onto the magnetotail . The secondary ovals observed inside the main oval may be related to the boundary between open and closed magnetic field lines or to the polar cusps . The polar auroral emissions are similar to those observed around Earth 's poles : both appear when electrons are accelerated towards the planet by potential drops , during reconnection of solar magnetic field with that of the planet . The regions within both main ovals emit most of auroral X @-@ rays . The spectrum of the auroral X @-@ ray radiation consists of spectral lines of highly ionized oxygen and sulfur , which probably appear when energetic ( hundreds of <unk> ) S and O ions precipitate into the polar atmosphere of Jupiter . The source of this precipitation remains unknown . 
 = = = Jupiter as a pulsar = = = 
 Jupiter is a powerful source of radio waves in the spectral region stretching from several kilohertz to tens of megahertz . Radio waves with frequencies of less than about 0 @.@ 3 MHz ( and thus wavelengths longer than 1 km ) are called the Jovian <unk> radiation or KOM . Those with frequencies in the interval of 0 @.@ 3 – 3 MHz ( with wavelengths of 100 – 1000 m ) are called the <unk> radiation or HOM , while emissions in the range 3 – 40 MHz ( with wavelengths of 10 – 100 m ) are referred to as the decametric radiation or DAM . The latter radiation was the first to be observed from Earth , and its approximately 10 @-@ hour periodicity helped to identify it as originating from Jupiter . The strongest part of decametric emission , which is related to Io and to the Io – Jupiter current system , is called Io @-@ DAM . 
 The majority of these emissions are thought to be produced by a mechanism called Cyclotron Maser Instability , which develops close to the auroral regions , when electrons bounce back and forth between the poles . The electrons involved in the generation of radio waves are probably those carrying currents from the poles of the planet to the magnetodisk . The intensity of Jovian radio emissions usually varies smoothly with time ; however , Jupiter periodically emits short and powerful bursts ( S bursts ) , which can outshine all other components . The total emitted power of the DAM component is about 100 GW , while the power of all other HOM / KOM components is about 10 GW . In comparison , the total power of Earth 's radio emissions is about 0 @.@ 1 GW . 
 Jupiter 's radio and particle emissions are strongly modulated by its rotation , which makes the planet somewhat similar to a pulsar . This periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere , which are caused by the tilt of the magnetic moment with respect to the rotational axis as well as by high @-@ latitude magnetic anomalies . The physics governing Jupiter 's radio emissions is similar to that of radio pulsars . They differ only in the scale , and Jupiter can be considered a very small radio pulsar too . In addition , Jupiter 's radio emissions strongly depend on solar wind pressure and , hence , on solar activity . 
 In addition to relatively long @-@ wavelength radiation , Jupiter also emits synchrotron radiation ( also known as the Jovian decimetric radiation or DIM radiation ) with frequencies in the range of 0 @.@ 1 – 15 GHz ( wavelength from 3 m to 2 cm ) , which is the bremsstrahlung radiation of the relativistic electrons trapped in the inner radiation belts of the planet . The energy of the electrons that contribute to the DIM emissions is from 0 @.@ 1 to 100 MeV , while the leading contribution comes from the electrons with energy in the range 1 – 20 MeV . This radiation is well @-@ understood and was used since the beginning of the 1960s to study the structure of the planet 's magnetic field and radiation belts . The particles in the radiation belts originate in the outer magnetosphere and are adiabatically accelerated , when they are transported to the inner magnetosphere . 
 Jupiter 's magnetosphere ejects streams of high @-@ energy electrons and ions ( energy up to tens megaelectronvolts ) , which travel as far as Earth 's orbit . These streams are highly collimated and vary with the rotational period of the planet like the radio emissions . In this respect as well , Jupiter shows similarity to a pulsar . 
 = = Interaction with rings and moons = = 
 Jupiter 's extensive magnetosphere envelops its ring system and the orbits of all four Galilean satellites . Orbiting near the magnetic equator , these bodies serve as sources and sinks of magnetospheric plasma , while energetic particles from the magnetosphere alter their surfaces . The particles sputter off material from the surfaces and create chemical changes via radiolysis . The plasma 's co @-@ rotation with the planet means that the plasma preferably interacts with the moons ' trailing hemispheres , causing noticeable hemispheric asymmetries . In addition , the large internal magnetic fields of the moons contribute to the Jovian magnetic field . 
 Close to Jupiter , the planet 's rings and small moons absorb high @-@ energy particles ( energy above 10 keV ) from the radiation belts . This creates noticeable gaps in the belts ' spatial distribution and affects the decimetric synchrotron radiation . In fact , the existence of Jupiter 's rings was first hypothesized on the basis of data from the Pioneer 11 spacecraft , which detected a sharp drop in the number of high @-@ energy ions close to the planet . The planetary magnetic field strongly influences the motion of sub @-@ micrometer ring particles as well , which acquire an electrical charge under the influence of solar ultraviolet radiation . Their behavior is similar to that of co @-@ rotating ions . The resonant interaction between the co @-@ rotation and the orbital motion is thought to be responsible for the creation of Jupiter 's innermost halo ring ( located between 1 @.@ 4 and 1 @.@ 71 RJ ) , which consists of sub @-@ micrometer particles on highly inclined and eccentric orbits . The particles originate in the main ring ; however , when they drift toward Jupiter , their orbits are modified by the strong 3 : 2 Lorentz resonance located at 1 @.@ 71 RJ , which increases their inclinations and eccentricities . Another 2 : 1 Lorentz resonance at 1 @.@ 4 <unk> defines the inner boundary of the halo ring . 
 All Galilean moons have thin atmospheres with surface pressures in the range 0 @.@ 01 – 1 nbar , which in turn support substantial <unk> with electron densities in the range of 1 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 cm − 3 . The co @-@ rotational flow of cold magnetospheric plasma is partially diverted around them by the currents induced in their <unk> , creating wedge @-@ shaped structures known as Alfvén wings . The interaction of the large moons with the co @-@ rotational flow is similar to the interaction of the solar wind with the non @-@ magnetized planets like Venus , although the co @-@ rotational speed is usually subsonic ( the speeds vary from 74 to 328 km / s ) , which prevents the formation of a bow shock . The pressure from the co @-@ rotating plasma continuously strips gases from the moons ' atmospheres ( especially from that of Io ) , and some of these atoms are ionized and brought into co @-@ rotation . This process creates gas and plasma tori in the vicinity of moons ' orbits with the Ionian torus being the most prominent . In effect , the Galilean moons ( mainly Io ) serve as the principal plasma sources in Jupiter 's inner and middle magnetosphere . Meanwhile , the energetic particles are largely unaffected by the Alfvén wings and have free access to the moons ' surfaces ( except Ganymede 's ) . 
 The icy Galilean moons , Europa , Ganymede and Callisto , all generate induced magnetic moments in response to changes in Jupiter 's magnetic field . These varying magnetic moments create dipole magnetic fields around them , which act to compensate for changes in the ambient field . The induction is thought to take place in subsurface layers of salty water , which are likely to exist in all of Jupiter 's large icy moons . These underground oceans can potentially harbor life , and evidence for their presence was one of the most important discoveries made in the 1990s by spacecraft . 
 The interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with Ganymede , which has an intrinsic magnetic moment , differs from its interaction with the non @-@ magnetized moons . Ganymede 's internal magnetic field carves a cavity inside Jupiter 's magnetosphere with a diameter of approximately two Ganymede diameters , creating a mini @-@ magnetosphere within Jupiter 's magnetosphere . Ganymede 's magnetic field diverts the co @-@ rotating plasma flow around its magnetosphere . It also protects the moon 's equatorial regions , where the field lines are closed , from energetic particles . The latter can still freely strike Ganymede 's poles , where the field lines are open . Some of the energetic particles are trapped near the equator of Ganymede , creating mini @-@ radiation belts . Energetic electrons entering its thin atmosphere are responsible for the observed Ganymedian polar aurorae . 
 Charged particles have a considerable influence on the surface properties of Galilean moons . Plasma originating from Io carries sulfur and sodium ions farther from the planet , where they are implanted preferentially on the trailing hemispheres of Europa and Ganymede . On Callisto however , for unknown reasons , sulfur is concentrated on the leading hemisphere . Plasma may also be responsible for darkening the moons ' trailing hemispheres ( again , except Callisto 's ) . Energetic electrons and ions , with the flux of the latter being more isotropic , bombard surface ice , sputtering atoms and molecules off and causing radiolysis of water and other chemical compounds . The energetic particles break water into oxygen and hydrogen , maintaining the thin oxygen atmospheres of the icy moons ( since the hydrogen escapes more rapidly ) . The compounds produced <unk> on the surfaces of Galilean moons also include ozone and hydrogen peroxide . If organics or carbonates are present , carbon dioxide , methanol and carbonic acid can be produced as well . In the presence of sulfur , likely products include sulfur dioxide , hydrogen disulfide and sulfuric acid . <unk> produced by radiolysis , like oxygen and ozone , may be trapped inside the ice and carried downward to the oceans over geologic time intervals , thus serving as a possible energy source for life .

 The first evidence for the existence of Jupiter 's magnetic field came in 1955 , with the discovery of the decametric radio emission or DAM . As the DAM 's spectrum extended up to 40 MHz , astronomers concluded that Jupiter must possess a magnetic field with a strength of about 1 <unk> ( 10 gauss ) . 
 In 1959 , observations in the microwave part of the electromagnetic ( EM ) spectrum ( 0 @.@ 1 – 10 GHz ) led to the discovery of the Jovian decimetric radiation ( DIM ) and the realization that it was synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic electrons trapped in the planet 's radiation belts . These synchrotron emissions were used to estimate the number and energy of the electrons around Jupiter and led to improved estimates of the magnetic moment and its tilt . 
 By 1973 the magnetic moment was known within a factor of two , whereas the tilt was correctly estimated at about 10 ° . The modulation of Jupiter 's DAM by Io ( the so @-@ called Io @-@ DAM ) was discovered in 1964 , and allowed Jupiter 's rotation period to be precisely determined . The definitive discovery of the Jovian magnetic field occurred in December 1973 , when the Pioneer 10 spacecraft flew near the planet . 
 = = Exploration after 1970 = = 
 As of 2009 a total of eight spacecraft have flown around Jupiter and all have contributed to the present knowledge of the Jovian magnetosphere . The first space probe to reach Jupiter was Pioneer 10 in December 1973 , which passed within 2 @.@ 9 RJ from the center of the planet . Its twin Pioneer 11 visited Jupiter a year later , traveling along a highly inclined trajectory and approaching the planet as close as 1 @.@ 6 RJ . 
 Pioneer provided the best coverage available of the inner magnetic field . The level of radiation at Jupiter was ten times more powerful than Pioneer 's designers had predicted , leading to fears that the probe would not survive ; however , with a few minor glitches , it managed to pass through the radiation belts , saved in large part by the fact that Jupiter 's magnetosphere had " wobbled " slightly upward at that point , moving away from the spacecraft . However , Pioneer 11 did lose most images of Io , as the radiation had caused its imaging photo polarimeter to receive a number of spurious commands . The subsequent and far more technologically advanced Voyager spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the massive radiation levels . 
 Voyagers 1 and 2 arrived to Jupiter in 1979 – 1980 and traveled almost in its equatorial plane . Voyager 1 , which passed within 5 RJ from the planet 's center , was first to encounter the Io plasma torus . Voyager 2 passed within 10 RJ and discovered the current sheet in the equatorial plane . The next probe to approach Jupiter was Ulysses in 1992 , which investigated the planet 's polar magnetosphere . 
 The Galileo spacecraft , which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003 , provided a comprehensive coverage of Jupiter 's magnetic field near the equatorial plane at distances up to 100 RJ . The regions studied included the magnetotail and the dawn and dusk sectors of the magnetosphere . While Galileo successfully survived in the harsh radiation environment of Jupiter , it still experienced a few technical problems . In particular , the spacecraft 's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors . Several times electrical arcs occurred between rotating and non @-@ rotating parts of the spacecraft , causing it to enter safe mode , which led to total loss of the data from the 16th , 18th and 33rd orbits . The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileo 's ultra @-@ stable quartz oscillator . 
 When the Cassini spacecraft flew by Jupiter in 2000 , it conducted coordinated measurements with Galileo . The last spacecraft to visit Jupiter was New Horizons in 2007 , which carried out a unique investigation of the Jovian magnetotail , traveling as far as 2500 RJ along its length . The coverage of Jupiter 's magnetosphere remains much poorer than for Earth 's magnetic field . Future missions ( Juno , for instance ) are important to further understand the Jovian magnetosphere 's dynamics . 
 In 2003 , NASA conducted a conceptual study called " Human Outer Planets Exploration " ( HOPE ) regarding the future human exploration of the outer solar system . The possibility was mooted of building a surface base on Callisto , because of the low radiation levels at the moon 's distance from Jupiter and its geological stability . Callisto is the only one of Jupiter 's Galilean satellites for which human exploration is feasible . The levels of ionizing radiation on Io , Europa and Ganymede are inimical to human life , and adequate protective measures have yet to be devised .

 Schulze Baking Company Plant is a factory building located on the South Side of Chicago , Illinois , United States . It is located at 40 East Garfield Boulevard ( also described as 55th Street and Wabash Avenue ) in the Washington Park community area in Cook County . Built in 1914 , the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 12 , 1982 . Originally built for the Schulze Baking Company , it was the home of the Hostess Brands ' Butternut Bread until 2004 . 
 The building features a terra cotta exterior with ornamentation that pays tribute to Louis Sullivan . The original flooring is made of reinforced concrete . In the early 21st century , the building fell into a state of disrepair . In 2016 , however , a developer stated that the building was being rehabilitated for adaptive reuse in 2017 and following years as a data center .

 The building is located between the western edge of Washington Park and the Dan Ryan Expressway along a section of Garfield Boulevard that formerly hosted prominent businesses such as the <unk> Milk Company and the Schulze Baking Company . The area has suffered from economic decay and crime . One of the few significant remaining businesses in the old Black Belt was the Butternut Bread Company , which occupied the building . 
 According to the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency , it currently functions as an Industry / Processing / Extraction - processing site , and its original historical function was as an Agriculture / Subsistence - processing site .

 Schulze with its signature Schulze Butternut Bread formed the starting company that eventually became Interstate Bakeries Corporation / Hostess Brands . The business was once Chicago 's largest wholesale business entity . Although , according to Form 10 @-@ K filings by the Interstate Bakeries Corporation with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission , the Schulze Baking Company was not formed until 1927 , many records contradict this claim . Historical accounts of Chicago claim that Paul Schulze , 1910 @-@ 11 president of the National Association of Master Bakers , started the Schulze Baking Company in 1893 with his brothers . Interstate 's own company history even confirms the 1893 beginning of Schulze . 
 In 1912 , prior to the construction of the plant , the company had four baking plants throughout the city of Chicago and general offices in the Chicago Stock Exchange Building on LaSalle Street in the Chicago Loop . In the 1910s , the company had extensive legal battles regarding protecting its trademarks . 
 In 1921 Paul Schulze sold control of the company to Ralph Leroy Nafziger . In 1930 Nafziger announced the formation of Interstate Bakeries through the merger of Schulze Baking and Western Bakeries of Los Angeles to form Interstate Bakeries . Schulze and Western continued to maintain their own separate companies under the Interstate umbrella until 1937 when Schulze formally became Interstate . 
 Paul Schulze went on to operate small bakeries elsewhere under the name of Schulze and Burch Biscuit Company .

 The building is a white terra cotta structure designed by John <unk> in 1914 for the Schulze Baking Company . The terra cotta walls were five storeys high . The building featured blue lettering , foliated cornice ornamentation , and <unk> of rosettes . The building uses 700 windows grouped to complement the ornamentation 's allusion to themes of nature and purity . The ornamentation is considered abstract , <unk> and modern . The company used Apron conveyor manufactured by the Jeffrey Manufacturing Company of Columbus , Ohio . A lengthy low industrial complex extends northward behind the main five @-@ story building .

The dimensions of the building 298 feet 4 inches ( 90 @.@ 93 m ) by 160 feet ( 49 m ) and it is composed of floor space segmented into 17 feet 6 inches ( 5 @.@ 33 m ) by 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) . The second floor is 9 inches ( 23 cm ) thick except in the 7 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 29 m ) square surrounding each column where it is 14 inches ( 36 cm ) thick . 
 As of late 2008 , the building was showing signs of wear , disrepair and neglect . At least one terra cotta cornice was missing , and the building had numerous walkway coverings to protect passersby from falling debris such as further terra cotta loss . One side wall was propped up with wood beams at 45 degree angles . In addition , the building had some graffiti markings . However , developer <unk> Foreman stated in February 2016 that the rehabilitation of the former Shulze Baking Company plant into a data center , to be called the Midway Technology Center , was on schedule for operation in 2017 . The adaptive reuse project allegedly involved the investment of more than $ 130 million .

 Clifford ' Cliff ' Williams ( born 14 December 1949 ) is a British musician who was a member of the Australian hard rock band AC / DC as their bassist and backing vocalist from 1977 until his retirement in 2016 . He had started his professional music career in 1967 and was previously in the British groups Home and Bandit . His first studio album with AC / DC was Powerage in 1978 . The band , including Williams , was inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003 . Williams 's playing style is noted for basic bass lines which follow the rhythm guitar . Williams ' side projects , while a member of AC / DC , include benefit concerts and playing with Emir & Frozen Camels on their album San ( 2002 ) and a European tour . In 2016 , Williams announced he would be retiring from the music industry after AC / DC 's Rock or Bust World Tour . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Clifford Williams was born on 14 December 1949 in Romford , Essex , on the outskirts of London . The Williams family moved to Hoylake , near Liverpool , in 1961 , where he was influenced by the local Merseybeat movement and decided to become a rock musician . At the age of 13 , he and some friends formed a band . Williams has listed The Rolling Stones , The Kinks and blues musicians such as Bo Diddley as influences for his style . He mostly learned to play bass guitar by " listening to records and picking out notes " , with formal training limited to some lessons from a professional Liverpool bassist . Williams left school when he was 16 years old , becoming an engineer by day and musician by night . 
 In 1966 , Williams became a professional musician and moved back to London , where he worked at a demolition site and in supermarkets , and played in short @-@ lived bands . Williams met guitarist Laurie <unk> ( later a member of Wishbone Ash ) , and the two became members of a band , Sugar , which soon broke up . 
 In 1970 , Williams and <unk> joined with singer Mick Stubbs , keyboardist Clive John and drummer Mick Cook to form the progressive rock group Home . The band signed a recording deal with Epic Records and issued their debut LP , Pause for a Hoarse Horse , in 1971 . Home was a supporting act for Jeff Beck , Mott the Hoople , The Faces and Led Zeppelin . In 1972 , Jim Anderson replaced John on keyboards and Home released a self @-@ titled album , featuring their only hit single , " Dreamer " , which peaked at No. 41 in the UK album charts . Their next album , The Alchemist , followed in 1973 , but did not gain chart success . When British folk singer @-@ songwriter Al Stewart suggested that Home back him on his first American tour in March 1974 , Mick Stubbs left the group . The rest of the members became the Al Stewart Band , but split up after the tour . 
 Williams briefly played with the American band Stars before forming Bandit in 1974 . Bandit 's line @-@ up included vocalist Jim Diamond and drummer Graham Broad ( later in Bucks Fizz and Roger Waters 's band ) . The group signed with Arista Records and released a self @-@ titled album in 1977 . Bandit also performed as Alexis Korner 's backing band on 1977 's The Lost Album before disbanding later that year . 
 = = AC / DC = = 
 In 1977 , Williams considered retiring from music when Bandit disbanded , but one of the group 's guitarists , Jimmy Litherland , convinced him to audition for Australian heavy rockers AC / DC . They were looking for a bassist as Mark Evans had been fired shortly after recording the 1977 studio album Let There Be Rock . AC / DC had formed in Australia in 1973 and by mid @-@ 1977 the line @-@ up was Malcolm Young on rhythm guitar and backing vocals alongside his brother Angus Young on lead guitar , Phil Rudd on drums and Bon Scott on vocals . Williams said shortly after being told about AC / DC 's auditions , he saw the band on Top of the Pops and reacted positively , describing them as " outrageous " . 
 For his audition , Williams played four jam sessions with the band , and on 27 May 1977 , he was asked to join AC / DC . Angus declared it was partly motivated because he thought the bassist 's good looks would attract more women to their concerts . Given Williams was replacing an Australian musician , he initially had difficulties obtaining a work permit to enter the country . His first performances with AC / DC were on the tour there supporting Let There Be Rock , with two secret gigs at Sydney 's <unk> . The album Powerage ( 1978 ) , produced by Vanda & Young , marked Williams 's studio debut . Williams has remained in AC / DC ever since , with only a temporary departure in 1991 as he suffered a kidney infection , during which Paul Greg had to play bass for some North American concerts in the Razors Edge World Tour . The only current member who has been with the band longer is Angus Young . Along with playing bass , Williams also sings backing vocals . His favourite albums with the band are Powerage and Back in Black . 
 Since Williams ' introduction to the band , AC / DC has been inducted to the Australian Recording Industry Association 's Hall of Fame ( in 1988 ) , and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ( in 2003 ) . In 1982 , Kerrang ! readers voted him as Best Bassist of the year . 
 On July 8th , 2016 , Williams announced his plans to retire following the Rock or Bust World Tour . He cited the recent departures of other band members - Malcolm could not record the album due to dementia , Phil Rudd could not tour following a house arrest , and singer Brian Johnson only performed in half the concerts before a medical leave - as a reason for his decision , feeling AC / DC " it ’ s a changed animal " .

 Williams ' wife , Georganne , is from the US state of Louisiana ( north shore ) . After they married in 1980 , he moved permanently to the United States . Initially the couple lived in Hawaii , but Williams found the islands too isolated and the school system lacking . In 1986 , they moved to Fort Myers , Florida , following a suggestion from AC / DC bandmate Brian Johnson ( Bon Scott 's replacement ) , who lived in Fort Myers Beach at the time , but has since moved to nearby Sarasota . Cliff has been known to spend time in Aix @-@ en @-@ Provence among distant relatives , including local French guitar player Noah <unk> . The couple have two children : Erin ( born 1985 ) who is a model @-@ actress under the name Erin Lucas , and Luke ( born 1986 ) . His hobbies include fishing and amateur flying .

 In 1984 , Williams played bass and backing vocals on Adam Bomb 's song " I Want My Heavy Metal " , for the album Fatal Attraction . During AC / DC 's hiatus in the 2000s , Williams joined Bosnian musician Emir Bukovica 's band Emir & Frozen Camels . The group recorded the album San in 2002 and played in some European clubs . In 2005 , Williams and AC / DC singer Johnson played in a hurricane relief event in Florida , promoted by the John Entwistle Foundation . There Williams met drummer Steve Luongo , president of the foundation and former member of the John Entwistle band . Luongo later brought Williams , Johnson , and guitarist Mark Hitt for the Classic Rock Cares charity project . The quartet composed and recorded ten tracks in the studio in 2007 , and followed that with a tour to raise funds for the foundation . In 2011 , Williams played on a benefit concert organized by Mark <unk> . Williams said he also occasionally plays with a rhythm and blues band from Fort Myers called The Juice . 
 = = Style = = 
 Williams 's role in AC / DC is to provide steady but basic bass lines which follow the rhythm guitar of Malcolm Young , consisting mostly of eighth notes . His bass lines are sometimes written by Malcolm and Angus Young during composition , and at other times Williams develops them based on the other instrumental tracks . Williams said he plays " the same thing in every song , for the most part . In AC / DC 's music , the song is more important than any individual 's bit in it . " He added that " complex [ bass ] lines wouldn 't add anything to a guitar @-@ oriented band like ours , so I try to create a bottom layer that drives what our guys are doing on top . " Williams has no difficulty keeping his low profile within the band , declaring that " I don 't have any problem doing this , because I enjoy playing simply . I never feel angry or prisoner . " His playing technique is mostly centred around <unk> , with occasional use of plucking to mute the strings , which he says " adds more definition and tightens up the notes , and it gives the sound less sustain " .

 In his first appearance in 1977 , he used a Gibson ripper only for the " Let There Be Rock " music video . Cliff Williams ' trademark instrument is the <unk> and other basses by Music Man , strung with D 'Addario ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , .105 ) <unk> in the studio and <unk> <unk> in concert . Williams states that despite trying other basses over the years , he always goes back to Music Man 's instruments , which he described as " a tremendous work horse of a bass " . Other basses used include the Fender Precision Bass , a Gibson Thunderbird non @-@ reverse , Fender Jazz Bass , the Steinberger L @-@ series , a Gibson EB @-@ 3 and at least two LAG Custom basses . Williams has used 3 Ampeg SVT @-@ <unk> cabinets with 2 SVT @-@ <unk> Heads . If there was any interference with the wireless systems , he has used cables in his live performances . 
 = PIAT = 
 The Projector , Infantry , Anti Tank ( PIAT ) Mk I was a British man @-@ portable anti @-@ tank weapon developed during the Second World War . The PIAT was designed in 1942 in response to the British Army 's need for a more effective infantry anti @-@ tank weapon , and entered service in 1943 . 
 The PIAT was based on the spigot mortar system , that launched a 2 @.@ 5 pound ( 1 @.@ 1 kg ) bomb using a powerful spring and a cartridge in the tail of the projectile . It possessed an effective range of approximately 115 yards ( 110 m ) in a direct fire anti @-@ tank role , and 350 yards ( 320 m ) in an indirect fire ' house @-@ breaking ' role . The PIAT had several advantages over other infantry anti @-@ tank weapons of the period , which included a lack of muzzle smoke to reveal the position of the user , and an inexpensive barrel ; however , the type also had some disadvantages , a difficulty in cocking the weapon , the fragility of the barrel , powerful recoil , and problems with ammunition reliability . 
 The PIAT was first used during the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943 , and remained in use with British and Commonwealth forces until the early 1950s . PIATs were supplied to or obtained by other nations and forces , including the Soviet Union ( through Lend Lease ) , the French resistance , the Polish Underground , and the Israeli Haganah ( which used PIATs during the 1948 Arab – Israeli War ) . Six members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces received Victoria Crosses for their use of the PIAT in combat . 
 = = Development = = 
 At the beginning of the Second World War , the British Army possessed two primary anti @-@ tank weapons for its infantry : the Boys anti @-@ tank rifle and the No. 68 AT Rifle Grenade . However , neither of these was particularly effective as an anti @-@ tank weapon . The No. 68 anti @-@ tank grenade was designed to be fired from a discharger fitted onto the muzzle of an infantryman 's rifle , but this meant that the grenade was too light to deal significant damage , resulting in it rarely being used in action . The Boys was also inadequate in the anti @-@ tank role . It was heavy , which meant that it was difficult for infantry to handle effectively , and was outdated ; by 1940 it was effective only at short ranges , and then only against armoured cars and light tanks . In November 1941 during Operation Crusader , part of the North African Campaign , staff officers of the British Eighth Army were unable to find even a single instance of the Boys knocking out a German tank . 
 Due to these limitations , a new infantry anti @-@ tank weapon was required , and this ultimately came in the form of the Projector , Infantry , Anti @-@ Tank , commonly abbreviated to PIAT . The origins of the PIAT can be traced back as far as 1888 , when an American engineer by the name of Charles Edward Munroe was experimenting with guncotton ; he discovered that the explosive would yield a great deal more damage if there were a recess in it facing the target . This phenomenon is known as the ' Munroe effect ' . The German scientist Egon Neumann , found that lining the recess with metal enhanced the damage dealt even more . By the 1930s Henry <unk> , a Swiss engineer , had developed this technology even further and created hollow charge ammunition . This consisted of a recessed metal cone placed into an explosive warhead ; when the warhead hit its target , the explosive detonated and turned the cone into an extremely high @-@ speed spike . The speed of the spike , and the immense pressure it caused on impact , allowed it to create a small hole in armour plating and send a large pressure wave and large amounts of fragments into the interior of the target . It was this technology that was utilized in the No. 68 anti @-@ tank grenade . 
 Although the technology existed , it remained for British designers to develop a system that could deliver hollow @-@ charge ammunition in a larger size and with a greater range than that possessed by the No. 68 . At the same time that <unk> was developing hollow @-@ charge ammunition , Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Blacker of the Royal Artillery was investigating the possibility of developing a lightweight platoon mortar . However , rather than using the conventional system of firing the mortar shell from a barrel fixed to a baseplate , Blacker wanted to use the spigot mortar system . Instead of a barrel , there was a steel rod known as a ' spigot ' fixed to a baseplate , and the bomb itself had a propellant charge inside its tail . When the mortar was to be fired , the bomb was pushed down onto the spigot , which exploded the propellant charge and blew the bomb into the air . By effectively putting the barrel on the inside of the weapon , the barrel diameter was no longer a limitation on the warhead size . Blacker eventually designed a lightweight mortar that he named the ' <unk> ' and submitted it to the War Office , but it was turned down in favour of a Spanish design . Undeterred , however , Blacker continued with his experiments and decided to try to invent a hand @-@ held anti @-@ tank weapon based on the spigot design , but found that the spigot could not generate sufficient velocity needed to penetrate armour . But he did not abandon the design , and eventually come up with the Blacker Bombard , a swivelling spigot @-@ style system that could launch a 20 @-@ pound ( 9 kg ) bomb approximately 100 yards ( 90 m ) ; although the bombs it fired could not actually penetrate armour , they could still severely damage tanks , and in 1940 a large number of Blacker Bombards were issued to the Home Guard as anti @-@ tank weapons . 
 When Blacker became aware of the existence of hollow @-@ charge ammunition , he realized that it was exactly the kind of ammunition he was looking for to develop a hand @-@ held anti @-@ tank weapon , as it depended upon the energy contained within itself , and not the sheer velocity at which it was fired . Blacker then developed a hollow @-@ charge bomb with a propellant charge in its tail , which fitted into a shoulder @-@ fired launcher that consisted of a metal casing containing a large spring and a spigot ; the bomb was placed into a trough at the front of the casing , and when the trigger was pulled the spigot rammed into the tail of the bomb and fired it out of the casing and up to approximately 140 metres ( 150 yd ) away . Blacker called the weapon the ' Baby Bombard ' , and presented it to the War Office in 1941 . However , when the weapon was tested it proved to have a host of problems ; a War Office report of June 1941 stated that the casing was flimsy and the spigot itself did not always fire when the trigger was pulled , and none of the bombs provided exploded upon contact with the target . 
 At the time that he developed the Baby Bombard and sent it off the War Office , Blacker was working for a government department known as <unk> , which was given the task of developing and delivering weapons for use by guerilla and resistance groups in Occupied Europe . Shortly after the trial of the Baby Bombard , Blacker was posted to other duties , and left the anti @-@ tank weapon in the hands of a colleague in the department , Major Millis Jefferis . Jefferis took the prototype Baby Bombard apart on the floor of his office in <unk> and rebuilt it , and then combined it with a hollow @-@ charge mortar bomb to create what he called the ' Jefferis Shoulder Gun ' . Jefferis then had a small number of prototype armour @-@ piercing HEAT rounds made , and took the weapon to be tested at the Small Arms School at Bisley . A Warrant Officer took the Shoulder Gun down to a firing range , aimed it at an armoured target , and pulled the trigger ; the Shoulder Gun pierced a hole in the target , but unfortunately also wounded the Warrant Officer when a piece of metal from the exploding round flew back and hit him . Jefferis himself then took the place of the Warrant Officer and fired off several more rounds , all of which pierced the armoured target but without wounding him . Impressed with the weapon , the Ordnance Board of the Small Arms School had the faults with the ammunition corrected , renamed the Shoulder Gun as the Projector , Infantry , Anti Tank , and ordered that it be issued to infantry units as a hand @-@ held anti @-@ tank weapon . Production of the PIAT began at the end of August 1942 . 
 There was disagreement over the name to be given to the new weapon . A press report in 1944 gave credit for both the PIAT and the Blacker Bombard to Jefferis . Blacker took exception to this and suggested to Jefferis that they should divide any award equally after his expenses had been deducted . The Ministry of Supply had already paid Blacker £ 50 @,@ 000 for his expenses in relation to the Bombard and PIAT . Churchill himself got involved in the argument ; writing to the Secretary of State for war in January 1943 he asked " Why should the name Jefferis shoulder gun be changed to PIAT ? Nobody objected to the Boys rifle , although that had a rather odd ring . " Churchill supported Jefferis claims , but he did not get his way . For his part Blacker received £ 25 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to £ 973 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) . from the Inventions Board . 
 = = Design = = 
 The PIAT was 39 inches ( 0 @.@ 99 m ) long and weighed 32 pounds ( 15 kg ) , with an effective direct fire range of approximately 115 yards ( 110 m ) and a maximum indirect fire range of 350 yards ( 320 m ) . It could be carried and operated by one man , but was usually assigned to a two @-@ man team , the second man acting as an ammunition carrier and loader . The PIAT launcher was a tube constructed out of thin sheets of steel , and contained the trigger mechanism and firing spring . At the front of the launcher was a small trough in which the bomb was placed , and the spigot ran down the middle of the launcher and into the trough . Padding for the user 's shoulder was fitted to the other end of the launcher , and rudimentary aperture sights were fitted on top for aiming ; the bombs launched by the PIAT possessed hollow tubular tails , into which a small propellant cartridge was inserted , and hollow @-@ charge warheads . 
 To initiate firing the weapon the trigger mechanism , which was essentially just a large spring , had to be cocked , and to do this was a difficult and awkward process . The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt , then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt ; the user would then have to bend over and pull the body of the weapon upwards , thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon . Once this was achieved , the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it to the rest of the weapon , and the PIAT could then be fired . Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging , as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon ; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position , as was often the case when using the weapon in action . 
 When the trigger was pulled , the spring pushed the firing pin forwards into the bomb , which ignited the propellant in the bomb and launched it out of the trough and into the air . The recoil caused by the detonation of the propellant then blew the firing pin backwards onto the spring ; this automatically cocked the weapon for subsequent shots , eliminating the need to manually re @-@ cock . 
 Tactical training emphasized that it was best utilized from a slit trench with surprise and concealment on the side of the PIAT team , and where possible enemy armoured vehicles should be engaged from the flank or rear . It was possible to use the PIAT as a crude mortar by placing the shoulder pad of the weapon on the ground and supporting it with a <unk> , giving the weapon an approximate range of 350 yards ( 320 m ) . The PIAT was often also used in combat to knock out enemy positions located in houses and bunkers . 
 Despite the difficulties in cocking and firing the weapon , it did have several advantages ; its barrel did not have to be replaced or require high @-@ grade materials that were expensive to produce , there was little muzzle blast that could give the user 's position away , and the size of the barrel meant it could accommodate relatively large calibre munitions . However , the weapon did have drawbacks . It was very heavy and bulky , which meant that it was quite unpopular with the British and Commonwealth troops who were issued with it . There were also problems with its penetrative power ; although the PIAT was theoretically able to penetrate approximately 100 millimetres ( 4 in ) of armour , field experience during the Allied invasion of Sicily , which was substantiated by trials conducted during 1944 , confirmed otherwise . During these trials , a skilled user was unable to hit a target more than 60 % of the time at 100 yards ( 90 m ) , and faulty fuses meant that only 75 % of the bombs fired detonated on @-@ target . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 The PIAT entered service with British and Commonwealth units in mid @-@ 1943 , and was first used in action by Canadian troops during the Allied invasion of Sicily . The 1944 war establishment for a British platoon , which contained 36 men , had a single PIAT attached to the platoon headquarters , alongside a 2 @-@ inch ( 51 mm ) mortar detachment . Three PIATs were issued to every company at the headquarters level for issuing at the CO discretion - allowing one weapon for each platoon . British Army and Royal Marines commandos were also issued with PIATs and used them in action . The Australian Army allocated a PIAT ( which was also known as Projector Infantry Tank Attack in Australian service ) to each infantry platoon in its ' jungle divisions ' , which differed from the standard British organisation , from late 1943 . 
 A contemporary ( 1944 – 45 ) Canadian Army survey questioned 161 army officers , who had recently left combat , about the effectiveness of 31 different infantry weapons , in that survey the PIAT was ranked the number one most “ <unk> effective ” weapon , followed by the Bren gun in second place . 
 An analysis by British staff officers of the initial period of the Normandy campaign found that 7 % of all German tanks destroyed by British forces were knocked out by PIATs , compared to 6 % by rockets fired by aircraft . However , they also found that once German tanks had been fitted with armoured skirts that detonated hollow @-@ charge ammunition before it could penetrate the tank 's armour , the weapon became much less effective . 
 The PIAT was used in all theatres in which British and Commonwealth troops served , and remained in service until the early 1950s , when it was replaced by the American bazooka . The Australian Army briefly used PIATs at the start of the Korean War alongside 2 @.@ 36 @-@ inch ( 60 mm ) bazookas , but quickly replaced both weapons with 3 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 89 mm ) M20 " Super Bazookas " . As part of the Lend Lease agreement , between October 1941 and March 1946 the Soviet Union was supplied with 1 @,@ 000 PIATs and 100 @,@ 000 rounds of ammunition . The PIAT was also utilized by resistance groups in Occupied Europe . During the Warsaw Uprising , it was one of many weapons that Polish Underground resistance fighters used against German forces . And in occupied France , the French resistance used the PIAT in the absence of mortars or artillery . After the end of the Second World War , the Israeli Haganah used PIATs against Arab armour during the 1948 Israeli War of Independence . 
 Six Victoria Crosses were awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces for actions using the PIAT : 
 On 16 May 1944 , during the Italian Campaign , Fusilier Frank Jefferson used a PIAT to destroy a Panzer IV tank and repel a German counterattack launched against his unit as they assaulted a section of the Gustav Line . 
 On 6 June 1944 , Company Sergeant Major Stanley Hollis , in one of several actions that day , used a PIAT in an attack against a German field gun . 
 On 12 June 1944 Rifleman <unk> Lama of the 7th Gurkha Rifles used a PIAT to knock out two Japanese tanks attacking his unit at <unk> , Manipur , India ( given as Burma in the official citation ) . Despite sustaining injuries , <unk> Lama approached within thirty yards of the enemy tanks , and having knocked them out moved on to attack the crews as they tried to escape . When asked by his Army Commander , William Slim , why he went so close , he replied he was not certain of hitting with a PIAT beyond thirty yards . 
 Between 19 – 25 September 1944 , during the Battle of Arnhem , Major Robert Henry Cain used a PIAT to disable an Assault gun that was advancing on his company position , and to force another three German Panzer IV tanks to retreat during a later assault . 
 On the night of 21 / 22 October 1944 , Private Ernest <unk> ( " Smokey " ) Smith used a PIAT to destroy a German Mark V Panther tank , one of three Panthers and two self @-@ propelled guns attacking his small group . The self @-@ propelled vehicles were also knocked out . He then used a Thompson submachine gun to kill or repel about 30 enemy soldiers . His actions secured a bridgehead on the Savio River in Italy . 
 On 9 December 1944 , Captain John Henry Cound Brunt utilised a PIAT , amongst other weapons , to help repel an attack by the German 90th Panzergrenadier Division .

 = Edmund Sharpe = 
 Edmund Sharpe ( 31 October 1809 – 8 May 1877 ) was an English architect , architectural historian , railway engineer , and sanitary reformer . Born in Knutsford , Cheshire , he was educated first by his parents and then at schools locally and in Runcorn , Greenwich and Sedbergh . Following his graduation from Cambridge University he was awarded a travelling scholarship , enabling him to study architecture in Germany and southern France . In 1835 he established an architectural practice in Lancaster , initially working on his own . In 1845 he entered into partnership with Edward Paley , one of his pupils . Sharpe 's main focus was on churches , and he was a pioneer in the use of terracotta as a structural material in church building , designing what were known as " pot " churches , the first of which was St Stephen and All Martyrs ' Church , Lever Bridge . 
 He also designed secular buildings , including residential buildings and schools , and worked on the development of railways in north @-@ west England , designing bridges and planning new lines . In 1851 he resigned from his architectural practice , and in 1856 he moved from Lancaster , spending the remainder of his career mainly as a railway engineer , first in North Wales , then in Switzerland and southern France . Sharpe returned to England in 1866 to live in Scotforth near Lancaster , where he designed a final church near to his home . 
 While working in his architectural practice , Sharpe was involved in Lancaster 's civic affairs . He was an elected town councillor and served as mayor in 1848 – 49 . Concerned about the town 's poor water supply and sanitation , he championed the construction of new sewers and a waterworks . He was a talented musician , and took part in the artistic , literary , and scientific activities in the town . Also an accomplished sportsman , he took an active interest in archery , rowing and cricket . 
 Sharpe achieved national recognition as an architectural historian . He published books of detailed architectural drawings , wrote a number of articles on architecture , devised a scheme for the classification of English Gothic architectural styles , and in 1875 was awarded the Royal Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects . He was critical of much of the restoration of medieval churches that had become a major occupation of contemporary architects . Towards the end of his career Sharpe organised expeditions to study and draw buildings in England and France . While on such an expedition to Italy in 1877 , he was taken ill and died . His body was taken to Lancaster , where he was buried . Sharpe 's legacy consists of about 40 extant churches ; railway features , including the Conwy Valley Line and bridges on what is now the Lancashire section of the West Coast Main Line ; and his archive of architectural books , articles and drawings . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage , Brook Street in Knutsford , Cheshire , the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe . His father , a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church , came from Stamford in Lincolnshire . At the time of marriage his wife , Martha Whittaker , was on the staff of an academy for young ladies , Belvedere House , in Bath , Somerset . During his childhood in Knutsford , the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson , the future Mrs Gaskell . In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called <unk> , when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher . Edmund was initially educated by his parents , but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford . Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn , and in 1821 at Burney 's Academy in Greenwich . Edmund 's father died suddenly in November 1823 , aged 48 , and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family , where she later resumed her teaching career . 
 Edmund continued his education at Burney 's Academy , and became head boy . In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School ( then in the West Riding of Yorkshire , now in Cumbria ) , where he remained for two years . In November 1829 he entered St John 's College , Cambridge as a Lupton scholar . At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a <unk> Travelling <unk> by the University of Cambridge , which enabled him to travel abroad for three years ' study . At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College , William Whewell , was Professor of Mineralogy . John Hughes , Edmund Sharpe 's biographer , is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe . Edmund graduated BA in 1833 , and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836 . During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France , studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture . He had intended to travel further into northern France , but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to " fatigue and illness " . Edmund returned home to Lancaster late in 1835 , having by then decided to become an architect . In December he wrote a letter to William Whewell saying that he had " finally determined to adopt the Profession of Architecture " . Some sources state that Sharpe was articled to the architect Thomas Rickman . Sharpe did visit Rickman for a few days in 1832 and corresponded with him later . He may have been " acting as a research assistant " while on the Continent , but Hughes states " there is no evidence to suggest that Sharpe spent more time with Rickman , or served any kind of formal apprenticeship with him " .

 Edmund Sharpe started his practice at the end of 1835 in his mother 's house in Penny Street , moving into premises in Sun Street in 1838 . In October that year he took as his pupil Edward Graham Paley , then aged 15 . Later in 1838 Sharpe took a house in St Leonard 's Gate large enough to accommodate himself and Paley ; the practice continued to use the premises in Sun Street until after Sharpe 's retirement . In 1841 Thomas Austin also joined the practice as a pupil , staying until 1852 when he left to set up on his own as an architect in Newcastle upon Tyne . In 1845 Sharpe made Paley a partner , and in 1847 effectively handed the business over to him . At about this time also , John Douglas joined the firm as Paley 's assistant , and stayed with the firm until about 1859 , when he moved to Chester to establish his own practice . Sharpe retired completely from the practice in 1851 , leaving Paley as sole principal . Also in 1851 Paley married Sharpe 's sister , Frances .

 In his letter of December 1835 to William Whewell , Sharpe also mentioned that plans for at least one church , St Mark 's at Witton , west of Blackburn , were already well advanced , and that he was working towards another one , St Saviour 's near Bamber Bridge , south of Preston . In addition , he was in contact with the Earl of Derby with a view to designing a church for him near his seat at Knowsley , northeast of Liverpool . 
 Four of Sharpe 's earliest churches – St Saviour , Bamber Bridge ( 1836 – 37 ) ; St Mark , Witton ( 1836 – 38 ) ; . Christ Church , <unk> ( 1837 – 38 ) ; and St Paul , Farington , near Leyland ( 1839 – 40 ) – were in the Romanesque style , which he chose because " no style can be worked so cheap as the Romanesque " . They " turned out to be little more than rectangular ' preaching boxes ' ... with no frills and little ornamentation ; and many of them were later enlarged " . The only subsequent churches in which Sharpe used Romanesque elements were the chapel of All Saints , <unk> , near Knutsford ( 1839 ) ; St Mary , <unk> in Wharfedale ( 1846 ) ; and St Paul , Scotforth in south Lancaster ( 1874 ) , the last built towards the end of his life . 
 By 1838 Sharpe had begun to experiment with elements of English Gothic architecture , initially in the Early English style and in particular the lancet window , dating from the early 12th century or earlier . The first church he built in this style was St John the Evangelist , Cowgill , Dent , ( 1837 – 38 ) , followed closely by Holy Trinity , Howgill ( 1837 – 38 ) , and then by several others in the same style . He was soon incorporating elements from later styles of English Gothic architecture , and by 1839 was designing churches using Perpendicular features , as at St Peter , Stainforth ( 1839 – 42 ) , St John the Baptist , Bretherton , and St Peter , <unk> ( both 1839 – 40 ) . 
 Sharpe was one of the architects who designed churches for the Church Building Commission , which had been established by the Church Building Acts of 1818 and 1824 . The resulting churches have been called Commissioners ' churches , and were built to provide places of worship in newly populated areas . Sharpe designed six churches for the Commission : St John , Dukinfield , St George , Stalybridge ( both 1838 – 40 ) , St John the Baptist , Bretherton , St Paul , Farington , St Catharine , Scholes ( near Wigan ; 1839 – 41 ) , and Holy Trinity , Blackburn ( 1837 – 46 ) .He is also credited with the design of St. <unk> , <unk> , Cumberland ( 1842 @-@ 43 ) . 
 Although some architects designed the earlier Commissioners ' churches in neoclassical style , most were in Gothic Revival style . The earliest of the Gothic Revival churches were based loosely on the Early English style , with single or paired lancet windows between buttresses in the sides of the church , and stepped triple lancets at the east end . Others were in a " stilted Perpendicular " style , . with " thin west towers , thin buttresses , fat pinnacles , and interiors with three galleries and plaster vaults " . These features were only loosely derived from medieval Gothic architecture , and were not true representations of it . A major influence on the subsequent development of the Gothic Revival was <unk> Pugin ( 1812 – 52 ) and , influenced by him , the Cambridge Camden Society ( later named the Ecclesiological Society ) . Among other things , they argued that not only should Gothic be the only right and proper style for churches , but that their features should be accurate representations of that style ; they should be " correct " Gothic features , rather than being loosely derived from the style . The term " pre @-@ archaeological " was used to describe churches designed using features only loosely derived from true Gothic . 
 Sharpe 's early Gothic Revival works were pre @-@ archaeological , including Holy Trinity , Blackburn , built in 1837 – 46 for Revd JW Whittaker . Hughes expresses the opinion that this church is Sharpe 's pièce de resistance , it contains " a mongrel mix of Gothic styles " . Simultaneously Sharpe was involved in the design of about twelve more churches in Northwest England , which increasingly incorporated more " correct " Gothic features . In 1841 he obtained a contract to build three churches and associated structures ( vicarages and schools ) for the Weaver Navigation Trustees , at Weston Point , Runcorn ; Castle , Northwich ; and Winsford . All three were in Cheshire , and built between 1841 and 1844 . Between 1835 and 1842 Sharpe designed about 30 new churches in Lancashire and Cheshire , all to a low budget , and all to a degree pre @-@ archaeological . In 1843 Sharpe was able to fulfil his promise to build a church for the Earl of Derby ; this was St Mary , Knowsley , which was completed and consecrated the following year . It is described by Hughes as " one of Sharpe 's loveliest creations " . About the same time he designed a new steeple for St Michael , Kirkham ; the steeple and St Mary 's Church contained much more in the way of " correct " Gothic features , and both were praised by the Camden Society in The <unk> . 
 In the early 1840s Sharpe was invited by John Fletcher , his future brother @-@ in @-@ law , to build a church near Fletcher 's home in Little Bolton . Fletcher was the owner of a coal mine at Ladyshore , Little Lever , overlooking the River Irwell and the Manchester , Bolton & Bury Canal . He had been using the clay which came up with the coal to make refractory bricks for furnaces , and suggested its use for building the church , as it was much cheaper than stone . Sharpe then designed the first church in England to be built , in whole or in part , from this material ( terracotta ) , St Stephen and All Martyrs , Lever Bridge ( 1842 – 44 ) . As terracotta is commonly used to make plant pots and the like , Sharpe himself called this church , and its two successors , " the pot churches " , a nickname that has stuck . The advantages of terracotta were its cheapness , its sturdiness as a building material , and the fact that it could be moulded into almost any shape . It could therefore be used for walls , towers , arches , and arcades in a church , for the detailed decoration of capitals and pinnacles , and also , as at St Stephen 's , for the furnishings , such as the altar , pulpit , font , organ case , and the pew ends . Apart from the foundations and the rubble within the walls , St Stephen and All Martyrs was constructed entirely from terracotta . The following year , a second church was built using the same material , Trinity Church , Rusholme , south of Manchester ( 1845 – 46 ) , built and paid for by Thomas <unk> @-@ Worsley , who lived at nearby Platt Hall . In this case , although the exterior is in terracotta , the interior is of plastered brick . The church was consecrated in June 1846 , although at the time work on the spire had not yet started and several other features were incomplete , including the heating , seating , and floor tiling . 
 Towards the end of his life , Sharpe designed one more church incorporating terracotta , St Paul , Scotforth , Lancaster ( 1874 – 76 ) . For this he returned to the Romanesque style , and used terracotta as a building and a decorative material . By this time he was living in Scotforth , then a separate village to the south of Lancaster , but now absorbed into the city . The new church was built within 300 yards ( 274 m ) of his home , and again terracotta was not the only material used . It is used for the dressings , windows , doorways , the upper part of the tower , and internally for the piers and arches of the aisle arcades , but the walls are of stone .

 During his time as an architect Sharpe was also involved in the building , repair , and restoration of non @-@ ecclesiastic structures , including houses and bridges . In 1837 he was appointed bridgemaster for the Hundred of Lonsdale South of the Sands , and in 1839 he supervised the repair of Skerton Bridge over the River Lune in Lancaster . The following year he designed a new bridge over the River <unk> at <unk> , a village to the east of Wray . He had also been appointed as architect and superintendent of works for Lancaster Castle , the Judges ' Lodgings , and the County Lunatic Asylum ( later the Lancaster Moor Hospital ) . For the asylum he designed several new wings and a chapel , followed by extensions to the union workhouse . Sharpe was also involved in designing and altering several domestic buildings . In 1843 he designed a vicarage in Cockermouth , and the following year he started to remodel Capernwray Hall , a country house northeast of Lancaster . In the same year he designed the Governor 's House for Knutsford Gaol , and in 1845 he re @-@ designed <unk> Old Rectory for the Revd Thomas Austin , father of Sharpe 's pupil ( also named Thomas ) . Following Paley 's becoming a partner in 1845 , the pair worked together to design Lee Bridge in Over <unk> ( 1847 ) , to plan the conversion of a disused manor house into the Furness Abbey Hotel ( 1847 ) , and to arrange the remodelling of Hornby Castle ( 1847 – 52 ) . In 1849 – 50 they planned the rebuilding and enlargement of the Charity School for Girls in Middle Street , Lancaster , followed in 1851 by the National School for Boys in St Leonard 's Gate . The practice then made plans for a new building at Giggleswick School , and new premises for Lancaster Grammar School in Moor Lane , but by then Sharpe was on the point of withdrawing from the practice , and it is likely that most of the designs were prepared by Paley .

 Sharpe studied and wrote about ecclesiastical architecture throughout his adult life , both sketching and measuring historical churches and ruins . This resulted in a systematic series of published drawings in twelve parts between 1845 and 1847 entitled Architectural Parallels , containing measured drawings of abbey churches in the early Gothic style , and reissued as a single work in 1848 . Sharpe intended to produce a further version with text , but this never transpired . Also in 1848 a Supplement to Architectural Parallels , was published , containing yet more detailed drawings . Simultaneously , Sharpe had produced the two @-@ volume work Decorated Windows , the first volume being published in 1845 , and the second in 1849 . The work , which was praised by the art critic John Ruskin in The Stones of Venice , consisted largely of drawings by Sharpe 's pupils – Paley , Austin , and R. J. Withers – with text by Sharpe describing and analysing the tracery of Gothic windows . 
 In 1851 Sharpe published a monograph entitled The Seven Periods of English Architecture , a small book of about 50 pages suggesting a new scheme for classifying the styles of English ecclesiastical architecture " from the Heptarchy to the Reformation " . It was intended to replace the scheme then in use , which had been proposed in 1817 by Thomas Rickman . Rickman had divided English architecture into " four distinct periods , or styles " which he termed " Norman " , " Early English " , " Decorated English " , and " Perpendicular English " . The Norman style lasting until about 1189 , was characterised by its arches usually being semicircular , although sometimes pointed ; the ornamentation was " bold and rude " . The Early English style , continuing to about 1307 , was distinguished by its pointed arches and long narrow windows without mullions . He called the characteristic ornamentation " toothed " because it resembled the teeth of the shark . The following period , the Decorated English lasted until 1377 , or possibly 10 – 15 years later , was characterised by large windows with pointed arches containing mullions , and with tracery " in flowing lines forming circles , arches and other figures " . There was much ornamentation , carved very delicately . The final period identified by Rickman , the Perpendicular English , lasted until as long as 1630 or 1640 . This was distinguished by the mullions and the " ornamental <unk> " running in perpendicular lines . The ornamentation was in many cases " so crowded as to destroy the beauty of the design " . The carving was again " very delicately executed " . 
 In his classification , Sharpe first identified two main classes , according to whether the arches were " circular " or " pointed " . The class characterised by the circular arch was the Romanesque class ; that by the pointed arch was the Gothic . He divided the Romanesque class into two periods by date rather than by stylistic differences , the dividing date being 1066 ; this divided the " Saxon " from the " Norman " stage . Whereas Rickman allowed pointed arches when they occurred in the same building as round arches in his Norman period , Sharpe separated buildings that contained both types of arches into a separate intermediate style , the " Transitional " . When it came to the Gothic class , Sharpe identified four styles , in contrast to Rickman 's three , using the windows to differentiate between them . The earliest style was characterised by windows resembling a lancet " in its length , breadth , and principal proportions " . These windows might be single , or in groups of two , three , five , or seven . This style he termed the " Lancet Period " . During the next period , tracery appeared in the windows , and originally consisted of simple geometric forms , in particular the circle . This period he called the " Geometrical Period " . Later the tracery became more complex , including the ogee curve ; the characteristic feature being the " sinuosity of form " in the windows and elsewhere . This Sharpe termed the " Curvilinear Period " . Finally , the transom appeared in the windows , and the curved line in the tracery became replaced by straight lines , an " angularity of form " , and a " square edge was preferred " . This style he named the " Rectilinear Period " . The approximate dates Sharpe gave for his periods were , following 1066 , the Norman Period up to 1145 , the Transitional Period to 1190 , the Lancet Period to 1245 , the Geometrical Period to 1315 , the Curvilinear Period to 1360 , and the Rectilinear Period to 1550 . 
 In comparing the two classifications , Sharpe divides Rickman 's Norman period into two , the Norman and the Transitional periods . Then Rickman has three Gothic periods in contrast to Sharpe 's four . Comparing the descriptions of the styles and , approximately , the dates , Sharpe 's Lancet Period corresponds generally with Rickman 's Early English ; and Sharpe 's Rectilinear Period with Rickman 's Perpendicular English . This leaves Rickman 's Decorated English style divided into two periods by Sharpe according to the complexity of the tracery , the Geometrical and the Curvilinear Periods . Following the publication of the monograph , Sharpe read a paper to the Royal Institute of British Architects describing his system . The monograph and the paper led to " a bitter controversy " . The debate between Sharpe and his followers on one side and supporters of Rickman 's scheme on the other was published as a series of letters to the journal The Builder until the editor called a halt to the correspondence . 
 In the same year as Sharpe 's short book , An Essay on the Origin and Development of Window Tracery in England , a much larger work on essentially the same subject , was published by the distinguished historian Edward Augustus Freeman , which proposed the terms " Flowing " and " Flamboyant " ( the later already in use in France ) where Sharpe used " Curvilinear " . Although Rickman 's scheme remains in general use , despite recognition of its deficiencies , Sharpe 's terms " Geometrical " and " Curvilinear " are very often used in addition to distinguish styles or phases within Rickman 's " Decorated " . They were used by Francis Bond in his 1905 book Gothic Architecture in England , and are used in various recent works including the Pevsner Architectural Guides . 
 In 1869 Sharpe joined the Architectural Association , established in 1847 " by a group of dissatisfied young architects ... to provide a self @-@ directed , independent education at a time when there was no formal training available " . He then proposed and organised a series of six annual expeditions to study and draw buildings in different areas , which took place between 1870 and 1875 . In 1870 the expedition was to Lincoln , Sleaford , and Spalding ; in 1871 to Ely , Lynn , and Boston ; the following year to Stamford , Oundle , Wellingborough , and Northampton ; and in 1873 to Grantham , Newark , Southwell , Ashbourne , and Lichfield . The final two expeditions were to France : in 1874 to the northern part of the country , visiting places around Paris including Soissons , Laon , Rheims , and Chartres ; the following year it was to the Charente district of southwest France , including Angoulême . In 1876 Sharpe gave a lecture on this expedition in London , linking the architecture of the region with Byzantine architecture elsewhere . Following Sharpe 's death in 1877 the Association complied with his wish that the expeditions should be continued ; and in 1882 it published Charente : In Memory of Edmund Sharpe , 1875 . 
 Having been a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects since 1848 , Sharpe was awarded its Royal Gold Medal in 1875 . This was presented to him by Sir George Gilbert Scott , largely in recognition of his writings . In addition to those recorded above they include : The Architectural History of St Mary 's Church , New Shoreham ( 1861 ) , An Account of the Churches visited during the Lincoln Excursion of the Architectural Association ( 1871 ) , The <unk> of the Six Periods of British Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation ( 1871 – 74 ) , The Ornamentation of the Transitional Period of British Architecture AD 1145 – 90 ( 1871 ) , The Ornamentation of the Transitional Period in Central Germany ( 1877 ) , and The Churches of the Nene Valley , Northamptonshire ( published posthumously in 1880 ) . Other writings by Sharpe were published in The Builder and The Architect . He also delivered papers to the Architectural Association , and to the Royal Institute of British Architects . Among other subjects , he argued for restraint in the use of colour in the decoration of churches , in the painting of walls and the stonework , and in the stained glass . He was very critical of recent restorations of medieval churches , which had been a major occupation of architects during the previous 20 years , and was particularly caustic about the removal of whitewash from the interior of churches , and the damage thus caused to the underlying stonework . Between January 1874 and February 1875 Sharpe published The Architecture of the Cistercians , which dealt in considerable detail with the design and functions of Cistercian monasteries built in the 12th and 13th centuries in Britain and in Europe , most of which he had visited . In addition , Sharpe attended several meetings of the Archaeological Institute , and was a Vice @-@ President of the British Archaeological Association .

 While Sharpe was designing churches , he was augmenting his income by working as a sub @-@ contractor in building railways . These were the lines between Lancaster and Preston , Lancaster and Skipton , and between Liverpool and Southport . He first became involved with the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway in 1838 , two years after Joseph Locke was appointed as engineer for the line . Sharpe submitted a tender to supply the masonry work for the " Lancaster Contract " , the northern section of the line ; and Peter Perry from Durham submitted a tender for the earthwork . Locke insisted that both earthwork and masonry work should be under one contract , which Perry accepted and subcontracted the masonry work to Sharpe . Subsequently Perry reneged on his part of the contract , resulting in serious disputes between Sharpe , Locke , and the directors of the railway company concerning the costs involved and the quality of the work . The masonry for this section of the line included 15 under @-@ and @-@ over bridges and the six @-@ arch viaduct over the River Conder at <unk> . The eventual outcome of the conflict was that Sharpe was dismissed from the work in 1839 with agreed financial compensation , having built most but not all of these structures . 
 Sharpe 's next venture into railway building came in 1845 when , with others , he promoted the building of a cross @-@ country line from Lancaster to Skipton to join the Midland Railway in the West Riding of Yorkshire . This became known as the " Little " North Western Railway ( " L " NWR ) , with projected branches joining the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway ( then under construction ) at points near Milnthorpe and Orton . In the event the Milnthorpe branch was dropped during the committee stage of the passage through Parliament of the enabling Bill , leaving the Lancaster and Orton branches intact , parting at <unk> and making much use of the Lune Valley . 
 About this time , the amount of trade handled by the Port of Lancaster was declining , largely owing to silting up of the River Lune . In May 1842 Sharpe had been elected a Port Commissioner , and later proposed what became the Morecambe Bay Harbour Project . This planned to build a new port at Poulton @-@ le @-@ Sands ( soon to become part of Morecambe ) , and link it to Lancaster by means of a ship canal . After prolonged discussion this proved to be too expensive , and it was agreed to link Lancaster and Morecambe by railway rather than by canal . An Act for the creation of the Morecambe Harbour and Railway Company ( MH & R ) received Royal assent in July 1846 , the revised plan being to link this line to the " L " NWR at Green Ayre , in the northern part of Lancaster next to the River Lune . A clause in the Act allowed the MH & R to be sold to the " L " NWR , which took place in October . The parts played by Sharpe in all of this financial manoeuvring were conflicting and complex : he was simultaneously a Port Commissioner , a Town Councillor , a member of the board of the Morecambe Bay Harbour Company , and Secretary to the " L " NWR . In 1847 , near the Morecambe terminus of the railway , Sharpe laid the first stone of the North Western Hotel ( later the Midland ) , which he ( or more probably Paley ) had designed . In April that year Sharpe had resigned as Secretary to the " L " NWR to enable him to tender for building the line from Morecambe to Wennington , a village north @-@ east of Lancaster near to the Yorkshire border . His tender of £ 100 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to £ 8 @,@ 240 @,@ 000 as of 2015 ) for the line ( excluding the bridge over the River Lune at Green Ayre ) was accepted . He also gained the contract for building the harbour . In June 1848 the section of line from Lancaster to Morecambe was opened , and by October 1849 the ten @-@ mile section from Lancaster to Wennington was completed . In September Sharpe had also resigned as a director of the " L " NWR to become its traffic manager , and was then contracted to manufacture and supply rolling stock for the railway , something for which he had neither expertise nor previous experience . By February 1851 the line was experiencing difficulties , its traffic being less than expected and its costs rising ; and in December Sharpe was given notice that his contract with the company would be curtailed the following month . 
 Sharpe then turned his attention to the Liverpool , Crosby and Southport Railway ( <unk> ) and acted as its company secretary . When in 1854 the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway discontinued leasing its rolling stock to the <unk> , Sharpe arranged the manufacture of its own locomotives and carriages . Also in 1854 he submitted proposals for a branch line running from Bootle to the North Docks in Liverpool , part of which was built in March 1855 , though the project was never completed . 
 = = = North Wales = = = 
 In early 1856 Sharpe moved with his family to Llanrwst , North Wales with the intention of building a railway along the Conwy Valley . The prospectus for a line running from Conwy to Llanrwst was published in 1858 , with Sharpe named as its engineer . The intention for the full line was to build it from the Chester and Holyhead Railway to Betws @-@ y @-@ Coed , passing through Llanrwst ; it would be 15 miles ( 24 km ) long , with a gauge of 3 feet 3 inches ( 991 mm ) . A series of discussions and negotiations followed , resulting in changes to the route of the line from the west to the east side of the river , building it to the standard gauge ( 4 ft 8 ½ in ( <unk> ) ) , and running from Conwy only as far as Llanrwst . Construction started on 27 August 1860 , and the railway was opened on 17 June 1863 . An extension of the line to Betws @-@ y @-@ Coed was completed in 1868 , but by this time Sharpe and his family had moved to Geneva .

 In 1860 a horse @-@ drawn tramway had been built by Charles Burn , an Englishman , in Switzerland between Geneva and Carouge , a distance of about 4 miles ( 6 km ) . This proved to be a success , and Burn planned to build more lines . In 1863 he was joined by Sharpe as a partner , but after a short time of working together the partnership was dissolved , and Sharpe continued with the project alone . By March 1864 a line from the centre of Geneva to Chêne @-@ <unk> , a distance of about 6 miles ( 10 km ) was under construction , to an innovative design . The line to Carouge had two grooved rails . Sharpe 's line had two flat rails , with a third grooved rail between them , along which ran a wheel allowing the tram to be steered . The wheel could also be raised to permit the tram to deviate from the track to pass around obstacles , or come to the pavement . This line was Sharpe 's sole venture in Switzerland . 
 In August 1863 Sharpe was granted the concession for building a railway line in southern France from Perpignan to <unk> in the Pyrenees , a distance of 26 miles ( 42 km ) . Work on the line began in 1865 , but proceeded very slowly ; progress was blocked by local landowners , legal processes , and financial problems . Sharpe was managing the project largely from Paris , through a series of agents . By the latter part of 1864 the stress was adversely affecting his health , so in 1865 he spent some time in Italy to recuperate . Following his return the difficulties continued to mount , and in 1867 he renounced his concession . The line was eventually taken over by the State , and was not fully completed until about 1877 . At some point Sharpe bought property and iron ore mines along the route of the line . 
 = = Civic life and sanitary reform = = 
 Concurrently with designing churches and building railways , Sharpe was heavily involved in the civic life of Lancaster , particularly in pioneering sanitary reform . By political persuasion he was a Conservative , and in 1837 he joined the local Heart of Oak Club , the core of the Lancaster Conservative Association . He was elected a town councillor for Castle Ward in 1841 , a post he held for ten years , and in 1843 was appointed the town council 's representative on the local Police Commission . He was also a visitor to the national schools , and in November 1848 he was elected as mayor for year , at that time a position more like that of a " chief magistrate " . Through these offices he became aware of the unsatisfactory state of sanitation in the town , and resolved to improve it . The town was overcrowded , it suffered from poor housing , open sewers , overflowing cesspits , and a very poor water supply , mainly from wells polluted by infiltration . Many people suffered from typhus , and in 1848 there was an outbreak of cholera . The Police Commission had been established in Lancaster in 1825 with a wider role than suggested by its title , including " cleansing , lighting and watching " the town . However , there was constant friction between the Police Commission and the Town Council , the former tending to block any necessary reforms on the grounds of cost to the ratepayers . The conflict was unresolved until the two bodies merged in 1849 . The functions of the new body included the establishment of the first Lancaster Board of Health . 
 Before , during and after his mayoralty , Sharpe played a major role in promoting sanitary reform , often meeting considerable opposition and needing to use his oratorical , political and persuasive skills to the full . A campaign to deal with the problems had been initiated in 1847 by two Lancaster doctors , Thomas Howitt and Edward Denis de <unk> . Sharpe joined them , drawing extensively on his experience of having accompanied Professor Richard Owen ( born and educated in Lancaster ) on his tour of inspection of the town in 1844 . In 1848 Robert Rawlinson , also from Lancaster , was appointed as local surveyor , and published a further report that recommended new sewers and drains and the construction of a waterworks . Although Sharpe agreed in principle with the report , he was not satisfied with its details . Later that year , which was during his mayoralty , he travelled to London with the town clerk and a former mayor to meet representatives of the General Board of Health , including its chairman , Lord Morpeth , and its secretary Edwin Chadwick . As a result of this meeting , the Board of Health appointed James Smith from Scotland as an inspector , and commissioned him to produce a further report on Lancaster 's problems . Smith 's investigation took place in January 1849 , and his report was received in July . In his conclusions , Smith noted that Lancaster was favourably situated to provide a healthy environment for its inhabitants , and that this could be achieved by " a complete and constant supply of pure and soft water , and ... a thorough system of drainage and sewerage " . Subsequently , an Act of Parliament gave approval for these measures to be carried out , and in 1852 royal assent was given for the waterworks to be constructed . Delays , disputes and controversies continued , until the waterworks was eventually opened in 1855 , when work on the drainage and sewage systems was already under way . This enabled underground pipes for the two systems to be laid simultaneously . Sharpe had played a significant part in arranging Queen Victoria 's visit to Lancaster in October 1851 , and with Paley designed four triumphal arches for the occasion . He also took part in the proceedings on the day , escorting the Queen , Prince Albert , and the Prince of Wales ( the future King Edward VII ) to the top of the castle tower . 
 In 1859 Sharpe was appointed as a Justice of the Peace for Lancashire and for Denbighshire . Shortly after his return to Lancaster in 1866 he again became involved in local politics . In 1867 the constituency of Lancaster was disfranchised because of corruption , and so lost its two members of parliament . Sharpe wrote a long letter to Benjamin Disraeli ( Chancellor of the Exchequer , and responsible for the Reform Act of that year ) , arguing the case for reinstating Lancaster as a parliamentary constituency , and putting forward his own proposals for electoral reform . His letter received no reply , and Lancaster remained without parliamentary representation for the next 20 years . 
 = = Personal and family life = = 
 On 27 July 1843 Sharpe married Elizabeth Fletcher , second sister of John Fletcher , at Bolton Parish Church . The couple had five children : Francis in 1845 , Edmund junior ( known as Ted ) in 1847 , Emily in 1849 , Catherine ( known as Kate ) in 1850 , and Alfred in 1853 . 
 When Sharpe moved his family from Lancaster to live in North Wales in early 1856 he was aged 47 . The seven years he spent there were later described , in a Memoir published in 1882 by the Architectural Association , as " perhaps the happiest years of his life " . The family initially lived in a semi @-@ detached house called Bron Haul near Betws @-@ y @-@ Coed , on what is now the A5 road . Two years later he bought a larger property called Coed @-@ y @-@ Celyn on the east bank of the River <unk> , about a mile south of Betws @-@ y @-@ Coed . After moving to Geneva , the family lived for about three years in a rented property called <unk> on the road from Geneva to Chêne @-@ <unk> . Finally in 1866 the family moved back to Lancaster to live in Scotforth , then a small village to the south of the town . 
 Elizabeth Sharpe died on 15 March 1876 , a month after the consecration of St Paul , Scotforth where a plaque to her memory can be found in the chancel of the church . A year later , Sharpe travelled to northern Italy with his two daughters , his youngest son Alfred , and three research assistants , to make drawings of 12th @-@ century churches in the region . During the trip he became seriously ill with a chest infection and died on 8 May , in or near Milan . His body was taken to Lancaster , where he was buried on 19 May , alongside his wife , in the municipal cemetery . " Glowing obituaries " were carried by the local newspapers and the architectural press , including The Builder , The Building News , and The Architect . His estate was valued at " under £ 14 @,@ 000 " ( equivalent to £ 1 @,@ 190 @,@ 000 as of 2015 ) . A plaque to his memory was placed in the chancel of St Paul 's , next to that of his wife . 
 = = Other interests = = 
 Throughout his life , Sharpe took an interest in sport , as an active participant and as an organiser . At Cambridge , he was a member of the Lady Margaret Boat Club , and coxed the college boat . Back in Lancaster , he took up archery , joined the John O <unk> Bowmen , played cricket and coxed . In June 1841 he helped to found the Lancaster <unk> Cricket Club and the Lancaster Rowing Club . Sharpe was also an accomplished musician , and a member of the committee that organised the Lancaster Choral Society 's first concert in September 1836 . The society thrived for a number of years , and for a time Sharpe was its conductor . By the beginning of 1837 he was a member of the Lancaster Literary , Scientific , and Natural History Society , giving a number of talks to the society , and eventually becoming a committee member . That same year he became the secretary and treasurer of the Lancaster Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts , and in April 1840 he joined the committee of Lancaster 's Protestant Association . In 1842 he was part of a committee promoting congregational singing , and he gave an illustrated series of lectures on its history and merits . His love of music continued throughout his life , and included training choirs , composing hymn tunes , and manufacturing musical instruments similar to small harmoniums . 
 In early 1843 Sharpe bought Lancaster 's Theatre Royal ( now the Grand Theatre ) , the third @-@ oldest extant provincial theatre in Britain , which had opened in 1782 . He spent £ 680 ( equivalent to £ 60 @,@ 000 as of 2015 ) on converting it into the Music Hall and Museum . It was the only place in Lancaster , other than the churches , able to accommodate 400 or more people , and so was used for a variety of purposes , including concerts , lectures , and religious meetings . In 1848 Sharpe founded the Lancaster Athenaeum , a private society for " the promotion of public entertainment and instruction " , to which end it organised lectures on literary and scientific subjects , concerts and exhibitions . It held its meetings in the Music Hall , which was at one period renamed the Athenaeum . In 1852 Sharpe became the proprietor of the Phoenix Foundry on Germany Street , which among other things supplied cast iron pipes for the Lancaster waterworks , sewers and drains , and shells for the Crimean War . 
 = = Appraisal = = 
 Hughes considers that Sharpe was never in the " first division " of 19th @-@ century church architects ; his designs were " basic , workmanlike , and occasionally imaginative , though hardly inspiring " . There is no such thing as a " typical " church designed by Sharpe . He was an innovator and experimenter , and throughout his life a student of architecture . The architectural styles he used started with the Romanesque , passed through " pre @-@ archaeological " Gothic to " correct " Gothic , and then back to Romanesque for his last church . The sizes of the churches varied , from the small simple chapels at Cowgill and Howgill to the large and splendid church of Holy Trinity , Blackburn . During Sharpe 's earlier years in practice , between 1838 and 1842 , Britain was going through a period of severe economic recession , which may have been why he designed many of his churches to be built as cheaply as possible . 
 As an architectural historian , Hughes considers Sharpe to be " in the top rank " . His drawings of authentic Gothic buildings were still in use a century after his death . The architectural historian James Price states that Sharpe was " considered the greatest authority on Cistercian Abbeys in England " . Some writers have regarded Sharpe as an early pioneer of the Gothic Revival , although in Hughes ' opinion this is " probably more for his books than for his buildings " . In 1897 , 20 years after his death , Sharpe was considered to be sufficiently notable to merit an entry in the Dictionary of National Biography . In the article , the author refers to his being " an enthusiastic and profound student of medieval architecture " . As a railway engineer he was " hardly an unqualified success " ; but his administrative and persuasive skills were considerable , as is shown in his planning of railways in Northwest England , and in the sanitary reform and water supply of Lancaster . As an amateur musician his " gifts were prodigious " . Hughes considers that Sharpe " used his talents to the full " , and in view of the ways in which he employed his many gifts , Price describes him as Lancaster 's " Renaissance man " .

 = Temple Israel ( Memphis , Tennessee ) = 
 Temple Israel is a Reform Jewish congregation in Memphis , Tennessee , in the United States . It is the only Reform synagogue in Memphis , the oldest and largest Jewish congregation in Tennessee , and one of the largest Reform congregations in the U.S. It was founded in 1853 by mostly German Jews as Congregation B 'nai Israel ( Hebrew for " Children of Israel " ) . Led initially by cantors , in 1858 it hired its first rabbi , Jacob Peres , and leased its first building , which it renovated and eventually purchased . 
 Peres was fired in 1860 because he opened a store that conducted business on Saturdays , the Jewish Sabbath . He was replaced by Simon Tuska , who moved the congregation from Orthodox to Reform practices . Tuska died in 1871 , and was succeeded by Max Samfield ; under his leadership , the synagogue was one of the founding members of the Union for Reform Judaism . In 1884 , Children of Israel completed a new building , and membership grew rapidly . Samfield died in 1915 , and was succeeded by Bill Fineshriber , an outspoken supporter of women 's suffrage and equal rights for African Americans . The following year the congregation moved to a new building , where membership continued to grow . Fineshriber left in 1924 , and was succeeded by Harry Ettelson . 
 The synagogue experienced difficulty during the Great Depression — membership dropped , the congregational school was closed , and staff had their salaries reduced — but conditions had improved by the late 1930s . In 1943 the synagogue changed its name to Temple Israel , and by the late 1940s membership had almost doubled from its low point in the 1930s . Ettelson retired in 1954 , and was succeeded by Jimmy Wax . 
 Wax became known for his activism during the Civil Rights era . Though some members — particularly those whose families had lived in the South for generations — had segregationist views , others were prominent in the fight for black civil rights . During Wax 's tenure , most of Temple Israel 's members moved far from the existing synagogue , and in 1976 the congregation constructed its current building , closer to where most members lived . Wax retired in 1978 , and was succeeded by Harry Danziger , who brought traditional practices back to the congregation . He retired in 2000 , and was succeeded by Micah Greenstein . As of 2010 , Temple Israel has almost 1 @,@ 600 member families . Greenstein is the senior rabbi , and the cantor is John Kaplan . 
 = = Early history ( 1853 – 1857 ) = = 
 Temple Israel was established as the Orthodox Congregation B 'nai Israel in 1853 by 36 heads of families , and granted a charter by the state legislature on March 2 , 1854 . It grew out of Memphis 's Hebrew Benevolent Society , established in 1850 by German Jews . The Benevolent Society managed Memphis 's Jewish cemetery , supported poor Jews , and conducted High Holy Day services . The congregation was initially led by part @-@ time cantors . The first was Jonas Levy , who had been hired as cantor and ritual slaughterer . Levy was succeeded by H. Judah and then J. <unk> . A Hebrew school was also created , directed by <unk> . In 1857 , B 'nai Israel hired as organist Christopher Philip Winkler , described by Tim Sharp ( Dean of Fine Arts at Rhodes College in Memphis ) as the " Dean of Memphis Musicians " . Born in Germany in 1824 , he had emigrated to the United States at age 16 , and moved to Memphis in 1854 . There he taught music , performed , and composed works for B 'nai Israel 's services ; by 1894 he had completed over 850 pieces for the congregation . 
 In its first decades , the congregation worshiped in various locations in downtown Memphis , near the Mississippi River waterfront . It received a $ 2 @,@ 000 ( today $ 57 @,@ 000 ) bequest from the estate of New Orleans philanthropist Judah Touro , and used it to purchase a lot on Second Street , but did not feel financially secure enough to build a synagogue , and eventually sold the property . The congregation instead held services in members ' homes in 1853 , and subsequently ( until 1857 ) rented various premises on Front Street . The Touro funds eventually enabled the members to lease the Farmers and Merchants Bank building at Main and Exchange streets in late 1857 , which they converted to a synagogue . Funds for the renovation were raised by two committees ; one solicited donations from " all the Israelites in this city " , while the other 's task was " to receive subscriptions from Gentiles " . Additional funds were raised by selling members reserved seats in the new sanctuary . An auction was held on March 18 , 1858 , in which 50 men 's seats were sold for $ 343 ( today $ 9 @,@ 400 ) , and 44 women 's ' seats for $ 158 ( today $ 4 @,@ 300 ) . The renovated premises had seating for 150 men and approximately 50 women . In 1860 , the congregation contracted to purchase the property ; by 1865 , it owned it outright and was debt @-@ free . On March 2 , 2007 , 153 years to the day after the congregation received its charter from the State of Tennessee , a historical marker was erected by the Shelby County Historical Commission , the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation , and Temple Israel , on the corner where the synagogue had once stood . It described the building as the " First Permanent Jewish House of Worship in Tennessee " . 
 Membership in B 'nai Israel was restricted to men , and attendance at the ( at least ) quarterly meetings was mandatory . Men who missed a meeting without a reasonable excuse were fined . The members also instituted rules intended to guard the image of the small Jewish congregation in the eyes of the much larger Christian community . New members had to be approved by a secret ballot , and existing members could blackball candidates . A member could also be suspended or expelled if he acted in a disreputable manner . 
 B 'nai Israel was the only Jewish congregation in Memphis , and from the time it was established members were split between traditionalists and reformers . When remodeling their new building , the congregation voted eighteen to fourteen to maintain traditional separate seating for men and women . By 1858 , with enough funds to hire a full @-@ time spiritual leader , they consulted Rabbi Isaac Leeser , the leader of America 's Orthodox Jewish community , but were also in contact with Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise , the leader of America 's fledgling Reform movement , who had dedicated B 'nai Israel 's sanctuary earlier that year . The members had advertised for their first spiritual leader in Wise 's newspaper , The Israelite ( along with other English @-@ language Jewish newspapers ) at the same time they advertised for a kosher butcher . Leeser recommended Jacob J. Peres , an Orthodox rabbi . 
 = = Peres era ( 1858 – 1860 ) = = 
 Born and raised in the Netherlands , Peres had been a child prodigy who , before turning eighteen , had edited a Hebrew grammar , as well as a volume of proverbs written in five languages . Upon graduation from high school , he had been given a stipend by William I of the Netherlands to attend the Netherlands <unk> Seminary , where he pursued both secular and rabbinic studies . He was well @-@ versed in mathematics , language , literature and law , and co @-@ founded Peres and Micou , a legal firm . 
 B 'nai Israel hired Peres in December 1858 as cantor and teacher , in English and German , at an annual salary of $ 600 ( today $ 16 @,@ 000 ) with perquisites of $ 400 . By comparison , the kosher butcher 's salary was $ 300 , not including what he earned killing poultry . Peres also ran the Hebrew school and the choir , and was in effect the rabbi . Under his leadership , the membership took a serious interest in the plight of Jews around the world . For example , at a congregational meeting in January 1860 , they gathered money from the members present and B 'nai Israel 's treasury to assist suffering Moroccan Jews , and created a committee to raise funds throughout Memphis on their behalf . The congregation also moved more towards Orthodoxy , and passed a rule stating that only those members who were Sabbath observant could receive Torah honors on the High Holy Days . 
 Peres did not find his wages sufficient to support himself , his wife , and his four children . To supplement his income , he opened a grocery store and a commission business ( selling others ' goods on consignment ) with his brother . As Saturday ( the Jewish Sabbath ) was also the busiest day for commerce , he decided to keep his business open on that day — something forbidden by Jewish law , and at odds with the rule he had championed . Some of congregants objected , and at B 'nai Israel 's April 1860 quarterly meeting , charges were brought against him ; at a subsequent trial at a Jewish court , he was convicted and fired . In response , he sued the congregation in a civil court for lost wages and libel . The precedent @-@ setting case , which reached the Tennessee Supreme Court , was decided in his favor as regards the lost income , but against him regarding libel . The court 's ruling was that " a religious institution is sovereign ; that its laws and regulations are supreme ; and that its policies and practices may not be challenged by a legal action in a court of law " . In a letter to Rabbi Isaac Leeser in 1862 , Peres claimed that he had been framed and that the store was actually run by his brother , just under his name . He writes that the synagogue had accused him of opening on the Sabbath " in order to get rid of me . " 
 After Peres 's dismissal , the members began a search for what they called a " Moderate Reform " rabbi . This time , they consulted Wise , not Leeser . The position was advertised in Wise 's newspaper as a " Teacher , Preacher , and Reader " , paying $ 1 @,@ 000 ( today $ 26 @,@ 000 ) per year . Qualifications included the ability to " instruct children in Hebrew , lecture once a week in German or English and read the Prayers properly . " In 1860 , they hired Simon Tuska . Peres stayed in Memphis , and the theological tensions within the congregation were resolved when forty of the more traditional members departed ; with Peres as their spiritual leader , they formed the Orthodox Beth El Emeth congregation in the early 1860s . This division process was common to many American congregations of the time . 
 = = Tuska era ( 1860 – 1870 ) = = 
 Born in Veszprém , Hungary in 1835 , Tuska was raised in Rochester , New York , where his father was a rabbi . Simon attended the Rochester Theological Seminary , and upon completion of his studies there in 1858 , was sent to the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau to get rabbinic training . He did not graduate from the seminary , instead returning to the United States in 1860 to apply for a position at Congregation Emanu @-@ El of New York , but he was turned down because of his small size and weak voice . He then applied to Temple Israel , where on July 1 , 1860 , he was unanimously elected and signed a three @-@ year contract at $ 800 ( today $ 21 @,@ 000 ) per year . He proved to be very popular with the congregation ; in January 1863 , six months before the three @-@ year contract was up for renewal , he was re @-@ elected as rabbi for a ten @-@ year term , and his salary rose to $ 1 @,@ 500 per year . 
 Tuska reformed services at B 'nai Israel , removing piyyutim ( liturgical poems ) in 1861 , adding an organ and mixed @-@ gender choir in 1862 , and confirmation ceremonies in 1863 . He also shortened the prayer book ( adopting Wise 's Minhag America version ) , added a late Friday night service , and created patriotically themed services for Thanksgiving and National Fast Day . When more pews were required to accommodate the worshipers , they were first added to the men 's and women 's sections , then family pews were added where men and women could sit together . In May 1864 , as rabbi of B 'nai Israel , he officiated at what may have been the first Jewish wedding in Tennessee ; until that year , Tennessee did not authorize rabbis to perform marriages . He was also involved in the broader Memphis community , and participated in interfaith services . 
 Tuska supported slavery , describing the abolitionist views of Henry Ward Beecher and others as " rabid " , and like most members of B 'nai Israel , after hostilities broke out between the Union and the Confederacy , he supported secession from the Union . More than ten members of the congregation volunteered for the Confederate Army after war broke out , and they were given special honors and blessings at a ceremony during Sabbath services . Many Memphis schools were forced to close because of the Civil War ; in response , B 'nai Israel established the Hebrew Educational Institute in 1864 . A secular school , it had 100 students , and taught English , Hebrew , German , and French as well as geography and music . Tuska was one of the school 's language teachers . Insufficient funding forced its closure in 1868 . 
 B 'nai Israel had 83 members in 1864 . The mortgage on the synagogue building had been paid off by 1865 , but by 1867 the synagogue 's expenses were exceeding its income . Dues were raised to $ 4 ( today $ 70 ) per member per month , and the congregation took out a new mortgage . In January 1870 , the congregation moved Friday night services to 7 : 30 p.m. ; previously the services had been held just after sunset , in accordance with Jewish law , which had meant late @-@ night services in mid @-@ summer , and late @-@ afternoon services in mid @-@ winter . ( Several years later High Holy Day services were moved to the same time ) . That year Tuska began giving his Friday night sermons in English , rather than German . At the end of 1870 , Tuska died of a heart attack . 
 = = Samfield era ( 1871 – 1915 ) = = 
 In 1871 , the congregation , whose membership by this time had reached 100 , elected Max Samfield to succeed Tuska . The son of a rabbi , he was born in 1846 in Marktsteft , Bavaria , and was ordained in Germany . He left for the United States in 1867 to be rabbi of B 'nai Zion Congregation of Shreveport , Louisiana , where he served for four years . He had significant competition for the role at B 'nai Israel , with at least ten rabbis applying . Samfield had , however , preached there the Sabbath before the election for rabbi , and was hired for a one @-@ year term . A strong proponent of Reform Judaism , he was associated with Wise in founding the Union of American Hebrew Congregations ( now Union for Reform Judaism ) , and under his leadership , B 'nai Israel became one of its founding members in 1873 . He was also president of the Board of Governors of Hebrew Union College ( HUC ) in Cincinnati , Ohio , and was supervisor of the Central Conference of American Rabbis . In 1875 , he asked the congregation if he could abandon wearing the traditional head covering while leading the prayers ; in response , the members resolved that all men would be required to remove their hats during services . He led the congregation to adopt the Reform movement 's new Union Prayer Book in 1896 , but resisted moving Sabbath services to Sunday . Like most Reform rabbis at that time , he was strongly anti @-@ Zionist , writing that Zionism was " an abnormal eruption of perverted sentiment " . 
 A Scottish Mason , Samfield was committed to public service . When Tennessee 's first Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Children was formed in 1880 , he became its first vice @-@ president , and in 1889 , he led the fundraising for Memphis 's first civilian hospital , St. Joseph 's , a Catholic institution . He founded Memphis 's Hebrew Relief Association , and the non @-@ sectarian United Charities , and was a director of the New Orleans Jewish Orphans ' Home , Denver 's Jewish <unk> House , and New York 's Sheltering House Association . For the last fifteen years of his life he worked to create a home for elderly and infirm Southern Jews , completed in 1927 . 
 During Memphis 's 1873 yellow fever epidemic , he — along with other Memphis rabbis and leading Jews — remained in the city rather than fleeing . During the seven weeks the epidemic lasted , 51 people were buried in B 'nai Israel 's cemetery , almost twice the number typically buried there in a whole year . When another yellow fever epidemic broke out in 1878 , Samfield stayed again , ministering to the dead and dying of all faiths . During that epidemic 78 people were buried in the congregation 's cemetery . The city 's frequent yellow fever epidemics decimated its Jewish community , which dropped from 2 @,@ 100 to 300 . They also hurt B 'nai Israel 's finances ; members did not pay their dues , and for a time the congregation could not afford to pay Samfield . By 1880 , however , membership had increased to 124 families , and finances had improved . By this time , the synagogue was more typically called Children of Israel . Beth El Emeth was affected more severely than Children of Israel by the epidemics ; its rabbi ( Peres ) died of yellow fever in 1879 . In 1882 , Beth El Emeth disbanded , and transferred its property to Children of Israel , though most Beth El Emeth members joined the Orthodox Baron Hirsch Synagogue . The property included land on Second Street , and Beth El Emeth 's cemetery . 
 In 1872 , Children of Israel purchased land on Adams Avenue , with the intent of building a new synagogue there , but financial pressures delayed the project , and in 1880 the congregation decided to sell the property and find a better one . They sold the lot in 1882 , and instead purchased land on Poplar Avenue between Second and Third Streets . By 1884 , they had completed a new synagogue building there , at a cost of $ 39 @,@ 130 ( today $ 1 @,@ 031 @,@ 000 ) . The Byzantine Revival structure had an impressive façade featuring twin tall spires and a large round window containing a Star of David . The building helped attract new members ; by 1885 an additional 45 had joined , for a total of 173 member families , and the congregation was again debt @-@ free . That year , the synagogue acquired a cemetery on Hernando Road . 
 Though the congregation continued to grow , most new Jewish immigrants to Memphis were from Eastern Europe , and more traditional than the members of Children of Israel . As a result , they typically formed their own Orthodox synagogues , the oldest and longest @-@ lasting of which was the Baron Hirsch Synagogue . Members of Children of Israel worked to assist the Eastern European Jews in assimilating into American society , providing financial assistance , free education on topics such as English , civics , and even hygiene , and from 1897 to 1907 they held a Sunday School for children of the Baron Hirsch congregation . In 1890 , the membership of Children of Israel was 186 families , and the religious school had 148 students . To deal with persistent financial issues and attract younger members , in 1897 the congregation created a new class of member , the " <unk> " , who could not be elected to any office , but paid less in return . This innovation was successful ; 47 new members joined in 1898 , and the congregation 's total membership reached 222 families . Combined with cost cuts in other areas ( primarily reducing the amount paid to the choir ) , this pulled the synagogue out of a four @-@ year financial deficit . 
 At the end of the nineteenth century , the synagogue 's annual revenues were $ 7 @,@ 500 ( today $ 213 @,@ 000 ) . Around this time the congregation stopped hiring cantors , relying instead on the organist and choir to lead prayer @-@ singing . By 1905 , congregational membership had increased to 262 , and by 1907 it was 285 , and the synagogue 's annual revenues were $ 8 @,@ 500 . The congregational school , which held classes once a week , had fifteen teachers and 220 students . That year the congregation added 56 seats to the sanctuary , primarily to handle the increased attendance on the High Holy Days . Despite the congregation 's growth and the expansion of the sanctuary , attendance at regular services was sparse , particularly on Friday nights . From 1892 onward , Samfield publicly admonished the members for their poor Sabbath attendance , and in 1907 , he insisted that board members attend Friday night services . The board agreed on condition that Samfield ensured his sermons were no longer than 25 minutes . Notwithstanding these issues , in 1904 Children of Israel purchased him a house , and in 1910 voted him " rabbi for life " , at an annual salary of $ 4 @,@ 200 ( today $ 107 @,@ 000 ) . That year membership reached 305 families . In September 1911 , William H. " Bill " Fineshriber became the congregation 's first associate rabbi . By 1912 , the congregation had again grown too large for its building . Family membership was now 340 , and the religious school had 260 children enrolled . The congregation acquired land on Poplar Avenue at Montgomery Street , 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) east of their existing location , and began constructing a new synagogue there . 
 In addition to his other activities , in 1885 Samfield founded The Jewish Spectator , a weekly journal on Southern Jewish life and culture . He was its editor until his death in September 1915 , just days before his planned retirement . His death was announced with banner headlines , and to commemorate his passing , Memphis 's streetcars were stopped for ten minutes . 
 = = Fineshriber era ( 1915 – 1924 ) = = 
 Fineshriber succeeded Samfield in 1915 . Born in St. Louis , Missouri , in 1878 , his father had been a Reform rabbi , who died at the age of 37 . When Fineshriber was 13 , he moved to Cincinnati on his own , where he attended high school . After graduating , he attended the University of Cincinnati and entered HUC 's eight @-@ year program . By 1900 he had graduated from both and been ordained . He accepted his first pulpit that year at Temple Emanuel in Davenport , Iowa , and joined Children of Israel in 1911 as associate rabbi . He was the synagogue 's first HUC graduate , and its first American @-@ born rabbi . He had a quick wit , and was able to speak eloquently and extemporaneously on almost any topic . Often quoted in the newspapers , he was active in the Memphis community , and was a Rotarian , Shriner , and Freemason . He was also an early suffragist , and took up the cause at Children of Israel . At a 1913 women 's day event , featuring speakers from Louisiana , Arkansas , Mississippi and Tennessee , he was the only male speaker . At a 1914 rally he stated " Taxation without representation is tyranny ... [ The ] purpose of this meeting ... is to shock the people of Memphis into a realization that the question of equal suffrage is not child 's play . " 
 He spoke out strongly against the lynching of Ell Persons in 1917 . Persons , a black man accused of raping and decapitating a sixteen @-@ year @-@ old white girl , had been burned alive in front of a crowd of thousands in Memphis , and his remains dismembered , scattered , and displayed . Fineshriber called a congregational meeting to protest the lynching , convinced the membership to endorse a public condemnation of it , and acted as secretary to a group of clergymen who issued a statement decrying the practice . He also convinced the editor of Memphis 's largest newspaper , The Commercial Appeal , to write an editorial criticizing the lynching . Fineshriber supported other causes affecting African @-@ Americans ; he worked to improve their housing , spoke at black churches , and helped raise funds for them . He criticized the Ku Klux Klan from his pulpit , the only clergyman in Memphis to do so . In 1921 he publicized his intention to " preach on the Ku Klux Klan " at Children of Israel at an event which , it was hoped , would attract many non @-@ members . The Klan had re @-@ organized in Memphis that year , and less than a month after Fineshriber 's speech , marched publicly in Nashville 's Armistice Day parade . Despite threats against him , his wife , and children , Fineshriber continued to preach against the Klan at the temple and other venues . 
 In 1922 , in response to the attempt by William Jennings Bryan and his followers to ban the teaching of evolution in universities and public schools , Fineshriber devoted three Friday night sermons to discussing it . He emphasized to packed audiences the " inalienable right of free thought and free speech , guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States " , and argued that " [ t ] he majority of thoughtful and liberal preachers of the world have found no difficulty in accepting the theory of evolution without discarding their Bibles or their religion . You can worship God only in the light of truth " . Nevertheless , in 1925 Tennessee became the first state to ban the teaching of evolution in public schools , a law not repealed until 1967 . 
 During Fineshriber 's early years the congregation continued to modify its religious practices . At funerals , it encouraged mourners to leave the graveside , rather than having them wait until the coffin was lowered and cover it with earth themselves ( as was the traditional practice ) . By this time , few members had bar mitzvah ceremonies for their 13 @-@ year @-@ old boys ; instead , boys and girls participated in the Reform Confirmation ceremony ( though the synagogue still allowed those who wanted bar mitzvah ceremonies to have them ) . In 1916 , the congregation eliminated the observance of the eighth days of Passover and Sukkot , required all worshipers to stand when mourners stood to recite the kaddish , and restored the Orthodox practice of blessing and naming babies in the synagogue as part of the services . 
 Children of Israel dedicated its new synagogue building in 1916 . Designed by local architects Walk C. Jones , Sr. and Max <unk> , it featured a large central dome and two smaller flanking domes , and was designed to resemble Istanbul 's Hagia Sophia . Entrance was through three sets of double @-@ doors , and carved into the entablature was the biblical verse fragment " <unk> <unk> LOVE THY <unk> AS <unk> " ( Leviticus 19 : 18 ) . The building 's sanctuary seated 1 @,@ 200 , and had a huge $ 10 @,@ 000 ( today $ 220 @,@ 000 ) organ . The money for the latter had been raised by the recently formed Ladies Auxiliary , whose most effective fund @-@ raising activity involved selling home @-@ cooked meals . The building also had an auditorium with a stage , and fourteen classrooms for the religious school . Children of Israel 's vacated building was purchased by a new Orthodox congregation that had adopted the name of the disbanded Beth El Emeth . 
 After the United States entered World War I in 1917 , 131 men from Children of Israel enlisted or were drafted ; one was killed . By 1919 , the congregation 's family membership had reached 450 , and the synagogue 's annual revenues were $ 18 @,@ 000 ( today $ 250 @,@ 000 ) . The congregational school , which still held classes once a week , had 14 teachers and 388 students . The following year , women were given the right to vote at all congregational meetings . Fineshriber left in 1924 to become head rabbi of Congregation <unk> Israel in Philadelphia . During his tenure , Children of Israel 's membership doubled , and the religious school grew from 100 to 550 students . He died in 1968 , and is the congregation 's only deceased senior rabbi not buried in its cemetery . 
 = = Ettelson era ( 1925 – 1954 ) = = 
 Harry William Ettelson succeeded Fineshriber in 1925 , the first Southerner to lead the congregation . Born in 1883 , he was raised in Mobile , Alabama . He had a B.A. from the University of Cincinnati ( graduating in 1900 when he was seventeen ) , an M.A. from the University of Chicago , and a Ph.D. from Yale University . Ordained at HUC in 1904 , he first served Congregation Achduth Vesholom in Fort Wayne , Indiana , from 1904 to 1910 , then Congregation Beth Israel of Hartford , Connecticut , from 1911 to 1919 . From 1919 to 1925 he was associate rabbi , then head rabbi at Congregation Rodeph Shalom in Philadelphia . 
 Ettelson was a strong supporter of the Pittsburgh Platform and its principles , which became the basis for what was later known as " classical " Reform Judaism . The services he led reflected that : member participation in the services ( which were mostly in English ) was limited . While at Achduth Vesholom he moved services from Saturday to Sunday for a period , in an attempt to improve attendance . Even before his joining Children of Israel , the congregation had already substantially reformed its services ; it no longer held bar mitzvahs , observed the laws of kashrut , or allowed congregants to participate in the Torah reading . Aside from the Shema Yisrael and Kaddish , Hebrew or Aramaic prayers had been almost totally eliminated . Though he made few ritual changes himself , Ettelson continued this tradition , and emphasized community service over ritual practice , promoting Judaism as a universalist religion with a mission of justice and peace . The year he arrived he organized the Cross Cut Club , an inter @-@ faith group intended to counter religious prejudice . He served as its first president , and was its president again in 1950 . One of his initiatives there was the Union Civic Thanksgiving Service , an interdenominational eve @-@ of @-@ Thanksgiving service that was held for a number of years . In the 1930s it held an integrated meeting , and , as a result , was not invited back to the venue the following year . 
 When Ettelson joined the congregation , it had 650 member families . To accommodate growth , in 1926 the synagogue built an annex for the children 's religious school . That year the congregation also established the " Temple Men 's Club " , which had over 200 members , and joined the National Federation of Temple Brotherhoods . In 1928 , the congregation purchased an adjoining house south of the synagogue , for Junior Congregation meetings , and began broadcasting its Friday evening services on the radio . The costs for both endeavors were donated anonymously by synagogue member Abe Plough , founder and chairman of Schering @-@ Plough . The synagogue was hard @-@ hit by the Great Depression . Income from dues dropped from $ 47 @,@ 000 in 1928 ( today $ 650 @,@ 000 ) to $ 23 @,@ 000 in 1932 , and membership fell from 750 families in 1929 to as low as 629 families . The Talmud Torah was closed due to lack of funds , and board meetings focused on finding ways to keep the congregation going financially . Ettelson requested a pay reduction of $ 1 @,@ 000 ( today $ 16 @,@ 000 ) in 1931 , and a further 10 percent cut in 1933 , and the salaries of other synagogue employees were also cut . The Junior Congregation did well , though ; it had 189 paid members by 1933 , held Saturday morning and High Holy Days services , and conducted a number of other programs . The congregation eventually recovered as a whole , assisted by members who were leaders in the civic and business worlds . By 1936 , membership had increased to 650 , and the synagogue paid off the remaining mortgage on the Poplar and Montgomery synagogue building . 
 In 1932 , Ettelson became locally famous for a debate he had at Nashville 's Ellis Auditorium with Scopes Trial lawyer Clarence Darrow on whether or not religion was necessary . Ettelson argued in favor , Darrow against . Friction between Ettelson and some board members came to a head in 1937 , when the board discussed the issue of whether to retain him as rabbi ; when invited to the meeting , he spoke briefly , then resigned . The board recommended that his tenure be put to a congregational vote at the next annual meeting , where he was re @-@ elected in a secret ballot by a vote of 303 to 31 . He took an eight @-@ month medical leave in 1938 , and Children of Israel hired Morton Cohn as assistant rabbi . 
 The congregation was heavily involved in World War II , with many members serving in the armed forces , including Dudley Weinberg , who had succeeded Cohn as assistant rabbi . Children of Israel published a special newsletter for overseas members ; by the end of the war , approximately four hundred congregants had served — and fourteen had died — in the U.S. military . As with many other Reform congregations , the members of Temple Israel were split on the issue of Zionism . It is likely that a majority were anti @-@ Zionist , and the synagogue president joined the anti @-@ Zionist American Council for Judaism , though other prominent members supported Zionism , and still others were simply non @-@ Zionist . Ettelson initially opposed Zionism , though he did not join the council . With the growth of antisemitism inside and outside the United States , his views changed , and he was an early member of the local chapter of the Zionist United Palestine Appeal . Nevertheless , he successfully kept the issue from becoming divisive at the temple . 
 In 1943 , the congregation changed its name to Temple Israel . Its membership grew rapidly , from 914 families in 1944 to over 1 @,@ 100 by late 1949 , together with an increase in the number of children in line with the post @-@ war post – World War II baby boom . In 1951 the temple added a new education building , which had 22 classrooms , offices , and a library . That year the congregation also updated the synagogue 's kitchen , added air conditioning for the vestry and auditorium , and the same for the sanctuary in 1953 . Ettelson retired the following year , and was succeeded as senior rabbi by James Wax . 
 = = Wax era ( 1954 – 1978 ) = = 
 Born in 1912 , James Aaron " Jimmy " Wax was raised in Herculaneum , Missouri , where his was usually the only Jewish family in town . While attending Washington University in St. Louis , he was inspired by Rabbi Ferdinand Isserman of Temple Israel of St. Louis to become a rabbi , as a means of achieving social justice . Because of financial constraints brought on by the Depression , Wax had to finish his undergraduate schooling at Southeast Missouri State Teachers College , where he graduated with a B.A. in 1935 . Mentored by Isserman , he then applied to HUC . Because he had little background in Hebrew , he did intensive work in the language prior to and during his admission , and was eventually ordained and achieved a Master of Hebrew Letters degree there in 1941 . Turned down as a U.S. military chaplain , from 1941 to 1945 he served at United Hebrew Congregation in St. Louis , and at North Shore Congregation Israel in Glencoe , Illinois . In 1946 , he became assistant rabbi of Temple Israel , and in 1947 was promoted to associate rabbi . In the early 1950s he was twice elected president of the Memphis and Shelby County Mental Health Society . Upon Ettelson 's retirement in 1954 , Wax became senior rabbi . 
 By this time the synagogue had around 1 @,@ 200 member families , and over 600 children in its religious school . Wax initiated some changes in the congregation 's religious practices . One was to have a real ram 's horn shofar blown on Rosh Hashanah starting in 1954 , rather than the trumpet that had been used for a number of years . Under his leadership a number of members also started having bar mitzvah ceremonies for their children , though this did not become common until the 1970s . By the 1970s he had also added Hebrew classes to the religious school . 
 In 1955 he supported and raised funds for the creation of Memphis 's first Conservative synagogue , Beth Sholom , so that Conservative Jews would have their own place to worship . By 1964 , four assistant rabbis had succeeded Wax ; Milton G. Miller , Robert Blinder , Sandford Seltzer , and <unk> Wolf . That year Wax added Torah readings to the Friday evening service , and Temple Israel 's board began purchasing State of Israel Bonds ; in the wake of the 1967 Six @-@ Day War , the board resolved to buy Israel Bonds " to the maximum feasible extent " . By 1970 Wax had introduced services to celebrate Yom Ha <unk> and commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day . Though he initially resisted the idea of having a cantor , he eventually accepted a limited role for one , and in 1971 Thomas Schwartz was hired as Temple Israel 's first full @-@ time cantor / musical director in 80 years . Schwartz 's salary was not paid by the synagogue , but was instead paid privately by a group of its members . In 1978 , Wax received the National Human Relations Award from the Memphis Round Table of the National Conference of Christians and Jews . He retired a few weeks later , though he served as acting rabbi of Temple Beth El in Helena , Arkansas , visiting regularly from 1978 until his death in 1989 . 
 = = = Civil rights activism = = = 
 The African @-@ American Civil Rights Movement ( 1955 – 1968 ) sparked extremist antisemitism in the South , and " Communist Jews " were blamed for destroying democracy following the United States Supreme Court 's decision in Brown v. Board of Education . Southern Jews found themselves in a difficult position ; they were a vulnerable minority whose status in Southern white society was marginal and conditional on their acceptance of the status quo . Because of these concerns , particularly after the 1958 bombing of the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple in Atlanta , the congregation did not want Wax taking a public stand on civil rights . In addition , though Wax supported racial integration , not all his congregants did ; according to Wax , " Almost all native @-@ born Southerners whose families lived in the South for two or more generations have segregationist attitudes . " Rather than getting involved in public protests , Wax worked with groups supporting integration , such as the Memphis Ministers Association . He also encouraged Temple Israel 's members to join groups like the Panel of American Women , an interfaith and inter @-@ racial group that spoke in favor of religious and racial tolerance at community events and whose Memphis chapter was founded by congregation member Jocelyn <unk> . Temple Israel member Myra Dreifus co @-@ founded Memphis 's Fund for Needy Schoolchildren in the 1960s . It helped provide food for hungry schoolchildren , primarily in black schools , and later expanded its efforts to include the distribution of free or discounted clothing and footwear . The group had both white and black women as members , including members of Temple Israel , and because of Dreifus 's role in the Fund , Temple Israel itself supported it . By 1968 , members of the Sisterhood were donating money so that tutors could be bussed to the majority African @-@ American Kansas Street School . According to professor of women 's and gender studies Kimberly K. Little , this " marked the first occasion where Temple Israel opened its doors to community – based programs ; its prior charitable work focused on Jewish community outreach . " 
 Wax was particularly involved with Memphis Committee on Community Relations ( MCCR ) . The MCCR was formed in 1958 by a group of Memphis city leaders , with a goal of ending segregation in a non @-@ violent way . Individual committees worked to desegregate various public facilities in Memphis . The MCCR also worked to get blacks representation in government ( both elected and appointed officials ) , and created programs to improve economic conditions and job opportunities for blacks . Wax served as the MCCR 's secretary from its formation until its dissolution in the 1970s . Several other Temple Israel members worked with the MCCR , and , as owners of large Memphis companies , were able to implement desegregation in their own workplaces . Other Temple Israel members supported the civil rights movement : senior business executives convinced stores to hire black salespeople , Herschel <unk> chaired the Memphis War on Poverty Committee , and Marvin Ratner left a partnership at a prominent local law firm to form , along with two white and two black lawyers , Memphis 's first integrated law firm . 
 In January 1965 , Memphis mayor William B. Ingram asked Wax to join his Community Action Committee , a group which tried to get federal funding for anti @-@ poverty programs and job training for black youths . In August of that year , Wax became chair of its policy committee , a mostly black group . Though the committee created a number of helpful programs , disagreement over the mayor 's role in choosing members and controlling funds led to the group 's dissolution in January 1966 . Ingram lauded Wax 's efforts on behalf of the group . Wax was also active in other civil rights groups , including the Tennessee Council on Human Relations , the American Civil Liberties Union , the Memphis Urban League , and the Program of Progress , a group which worked to reform local government . He was elected president of the Memphis Ministers Association in May 1967 , even though he was its only Jewish member . 
 On January 31 , 1968 , two Memphis sanitation workers were crushed to death in a malfunctioning garbage compactor , prompting the start of the Memphis Sanitation Strike on February 12 . The mostly black sanitation workers were Memphis 's lowest paid civil servants , and received no overtime or holiday pay . Memphis 's mayor was now Henry Loeb , a former member of Temple Israel , who converted to Christianity soon after starting his term in 1968 , after marrying an Episcopalian woman . He refused to negotiate with the workers , and the strike soon came to national attention as a civil rights issue . After being contacted by black ministers , Wax arranged a meeting on February 18 between Loeb , local union leaders , and Jerry <unk> , head of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees . The talks , which continued until 5 : 00 am on the 19th , and resumed later that day , resolved nothing . Temple Israel member Dreifus used her past support for Loeb in his 1967 mayoralty campaign as a means of trying to force him to resolve the strike , and act as a representative of both white and black <unk> . The strike continued through March . In an attempt to defuse tension , Wax called a meeting of Memphis 's two clergy groups , the mostly white Memphis Ministers Association and the black Interdenominational Alliance for April 3 . The meeting , if anything , had the opposite effect ; the black ministers wanted to march immediately on the mayor 's office , while most of the white clergy , including Wax , refused to join the march , which they argued would just inflame the white public . 
 Martin Luther King , Jr. was assassinated in Memphis the next night . The Memphis Ministers Association organized a memorial service for King on the 5th . At the service , the ministers voted to march to Loeb 's office that day and insist he address the workers ' grievances and end the strike ; led by Wax and William Dimmick , the dean of St. Mary 's Cathedral , 250 clergymen marched in pairs to Loeb 's office , where he was urged in front of television cameras to end the strike . In his sermon at Temple Israel , Wax told the congregation : " This city shall witness a new spirit and the memory of this great prophet of our time shall be honored . There will be bigots and segregationists and the so @-@ called respectable but unrighteous people who will resist . But in the scheme of history , God 's will does prevail . " The strike was settled on April 16 , with the sanitation workers getting union recognition and other benefits . The only remaining impediment was a recommended ten @-@ cent @-@ an @-@ hour raise on May 1 , followed by another raise on September 1 . The city budget did not have the estimated $ 558 @,@ 000 ( today $ 3 @.@ 8 million ) required to pay the workers . To resolve the impasse , Temple Israel member Abe Plough donated the shortfall anonymously .

 By 1957 the synagogue sanctuary , which had been designed for 350 families , had become too small to accommodate Temple Israel 's over 1 @,@ 100 member families . In addition , since the 1950s Memphis 's Jewish community had been steadily moving from the downtown , where Temple Israel 's Poplar Avenue building was located , to the eastern suburbs ; by 1957 over half of the members , and three @-@ quarters of those with children in the congregational school , lived there . School attendance increased rapidly , and the student body soon outgrew its 1951 building . The school had to split attendance in 1959 , with the younger children attending on Saturday and the older ones on Sunday , and by 1961 , 780 children were enrolled . In the early 1960s , Temple Israel began holding weekday classes at Beth Sholom , which was closer to most members . 
 In 1963 , Temple Israel drew up plans for a new building , and in 1964 purchased land on White Station Road . In 1966 , the members voted against building there , as older members were attached to the existing building , and concerned about expenses , but by the early 1970s , the situation could no longer be ignored . Plough offered to donate one @-@ quarter of the $ 4 million cost of a new building . The land on White Station Road was sold , and a 30 @-@ acre ( 12 ha ) property on East Massey Road was purchased ; the congregation moved into the new building in September 1976 . The old synagogue was sold to Mid @-@ America Baptist Theological Seminary , which would occupy it for the next twenty years . The new building was designed by Francis Gassner of Gassner , Nathan and Partners , with Percival Goodman as consulting architect . It was constructed of steel and masonry , which was used for both the exterior and interior , and had copper roofing . In the front , a glass covered garden entered into a two @-@ story reception area , which led to a smaller foyer , and ultimately to the main sanctuary . It had 32 classrooms , and a 300 @-@ seat chapel , later named the Danziger Chapel in honor of rabbi Harry Danziger and his wife Jeanne . The ner <unk> , Torah ark doors , and Ten Commandments wall decoration from the Poplar Road building were installed in the new chapel . 
 The sanctuary , which sat up to 1 @,@ 500 , was semi @-@ circular in shape , and designed so that no worshiper was more than fifteen rows from the Torah ark . It was lit by skylights , and had a balcony . Its ceiling , along with those of the entrance foyer and chapel , were of oak , as were the doors , trim , and paneling . The building 's interior art work was designed by Efrem Weitzman , including the Torah ark , most ritual objects , stained glass , mosaics , and tapestries . In the architect 's view , the compact design of the sanctuary , and the liberal use of stained glass and wood , " achieved the desired feelings of intimacy " . On the same level as the balcony was a gallery , originally designed for art and Judaica exhibits . In 1994 , upon the donation by Herta and Justin Adler of the Adler Judaica Collection , this became a permanent museum . The complex at 1376 East Massey Road had a final cost of $ 7 million ( today $ 29 @.@ 1 million ) , of which Plough donated over $ 2 million . In gratitude for his donation , Plough was named honorary president for life . 
 In 2003 , the congregation embarked on a significant renovation and expansion of its facility . Over 100 @,@ 000 square feet ( 9 @,@ 300 m2 ) of space , including the social hall , was renovated , and a 25 @,@ 000 square foot ( 2 @,@ 300 m2 ) early childhood and family center addition was built , creating a U @-@ shaped wing around a courtyard . Architect Walt Reed of The Crump Firm said he kept the emphasis on " simple , geometric , contemporary forms " that existed in the original building , as well as using the same copper roofing and detailing materials . The approximately $ 15 million construction project took two years , and was completed in 2007 . " Wings to the Heavens " , David Ascalon 's 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) -high , welded aluminum and stainless steel abstract kinetic sculpture , was installed in the atrium . 
 = = Danziger era ( 1978 – 2000 ) , 21st century = = 
 Harry K. Danziger succeeded Wax as rabbi in 1978 . The son of a rabbi , Danziger was a graduate of the University of Cincinnati , and ordained by the HUC . He joined Temple Israel as assistant rabbi in 1964 , but in 1969 moved to Monroe , Louisiana , to lead Congregation B 'nai Israel . He was replaced first by Howard Schwartz , then by Richard <unk> . <unk> tendered his resignation in 1973 , and Wax began to think of retirement . Danziger , then at Baltimore 's Temple <unk> Shalom , was approached as Wax 's successor , and returned to Temple Israel that year as associate rabbi . Synagogue membership had been around 1 @,@ 350 families from the mid @-@ 1960s , but increased after the move to East Massey Road . By Wax 's retirement it had reached around 1 @,@ 500 , and over half Memphis 's 10 @,@ 000 Jews were members of Temple Israel . 
 In his first sermon as associate rabbi , Danziger said " we can afford to look Jewish after all these years and ... out of self @-@ respect alone , we cannot afford not to " . As senior rabbi he slowly brought more traditional observances back to Temple Israel , moving it away from the radicalism of " Classical Reform " Judaism . These observances included the chanting of Torah blessings , a Torah procession through the sanctuary aisles , fasting on Yom Kippur , circumcising baby boys , and saying the kaddish for the deceased . In 1979 , he gradually replaced the old Union Prayer Book with the new Gates of Prayer prayer book , and later began wearing a <unk> while on the bimah . The changes were not uncontroversial , and the latter prompted one member to resign in protest . Though more traditional than his more recent predecessors , he was willing to perform intermarriages , but also counseled the couples as to the meaning of making a Jewish home . Danziger was involved in the Central Conference of American Rabbis and eventually became its president . 
 John Kaplan joined as cantor in 1981 , and made the services less formal and more interactive . His innovations included bringing in more modern tunes , encouraging congregational singing , and accompanying the services with a guitar , rather than the organ . By 2006 , Friday night services included a " spirit " service , at which a house band played . 
 During Danziger 's tenure , assistant rabbis included Alan Greenbaum ( 1977 – 1981 ) , Harry Rosenfeld ( 1981 – 1984 ) , Constance Abramson Golden — Temple Israel 's first female rabbi — ( 1984 – 1986 ) , and Marc Belgrad ( 1986 – 1991 ) . Micah D. Greenstein , the son of rabbi Howard Greenstein , succeeded Belgrad as assistant rabbi in 1991 , and was subsequently promoted to associate rabbi . A graduate of Cornell University and the John F. Kennedy School of Government , he was ordained by the HUC . On Danziger 's retirement in 2000 , he became senior rabbi . An advocate for social justice , he tried to convince the Shelby County Commission to pass a law forbidding discrimination against LGBT people , and has used the Bible to present counter @-@ arguments to those supporting such discrimination based on biblical verses . He has served twice as president of the Memphis Ministers Association , and sits on the boards of several local non @-@ profit organizations . 
 Valerie Cohen joined as assistant rabbi in 1999 , and served until 2003 , before becoming rabbi of Beth Israel Congregation of Jackson , Mississippi . Adam B. Grossman , a graduate of Ohio State and Xavier universities , and ordained at HUC , joined as assistant rabbi in June 2008 . He had previously served as a rabbinic intern at Dayton , Ohio 's Temple Israel . Katie M. Bauman , a graduate of Washington University in St. Louis , and ordained at HUC , joined as assistant rabbi in July 2009 . She had previously served in rabbinic roles in Natchez , Mississippi and Marion , Ohio , as a cantor in Cincinnati , Ohio 's Rockdale Temple , and in 2003 – 2004 , as Temple Israel 's Artist and Educator in Residence . 
 Temple Israel experienced modest fluctuations in membership during the 1990s and 2000s , and approximately half the Jews attending services in Memphis worshiped there . In 1995 , membership was over 1 @,@ 700 family units , and by 2004 , it had reached 1 @,@ 800 , and the religious school had 800 students . By 2008 , the school ( renamed the Wendy and Avron Fogelman Religious School ) had 500 students , and by 2010 membership had fallen to under 1 @,@ 600 families . It remained , nevertheless , the only Reform synagogue in Memphis , the largest and oldest synagogue in Tennessee , and one of the largest Reform synagogues in the United States . As of 2015 , Micah Greenstein is the senior rabbi , with Katie Bauman as associate rabbi , Harry Danziger as rabbi emeritus , and John Kaplan as cantor emeritus . 
 = New York State Route 312 = 
 New York State Route 312 ( NY 312 ) is a short but important state highway located entirely within the town of Southeast in Putnam County , New York , in the United States . It allows access , albeit indirectly , to the village of Brewster from Interstate 84 ( I @-@ 84 ) via a less complicated exit than the nearby I @-@ 684 exit , and is often heavily used for this purpose at rush hour by local residents . The western terminus of the route is at U.S. Route 6 ( US 6 ) roughly 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) northwest of Brewster . The eastern terminus is at NY 22 in the hamlet of Sears Corners . NY 312 was originally assigned to what is now NY 164 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York before being shifted south to its current location c . 1937 .

 = Development of L.A. Noire = 
 The development of L.A. Noire began in 2004 following the founding of its developer Team Bondi . Rockstar Games published L.A. Noire on 17 May 2011 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 , and on 8 November 2011 for Microsoft Windows . Though Team Bondi oversaw development , the work was shared between the core team and multiple Rockstar studios around the world . L.A. Noire was delayed numerous times through its seven @-@ year development , which included a change of publisher and platforms . The working hours and managerial style of the studio during development was met with public complaints from staff members . L.A. Noire was formally announced in 2005 ; it was heavily promoted through video trailers and press demonstrations . 
 The game is notable for being the first to use the newly developed MotionScan technology developed by Depth Analysis . MotionScan uses 32 surrounding cameras to capture actors ' facial expressions from every angle , resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face . The technology is central to the game 's interrogation mechanic , as players are required to use the suspects ' reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying . The game uses full motion capture actors to record the voices and movements of the characters . Over twenty hours of voice work was recorded for the game . 
 L.A. Noire 's open world is a recreation of 1947 Los Angeles . The development team conducted field research in Los Angeles throughout the game 's development , and compiled multiple aerial photographs to gather traffic and building information . Various plot points and investigations in the game are based on real life events , such as the Black Dahlia case . Like other games published by Rockstar , L.A. Noire uses licensed music provided by an in @-@ game radio . Over 30 licensed tracks continuously loop on one radio station . The game also features an original score composed by a group of musicians and inspired by 1940s films .

 = = = Overview = = = 
 Preliminary work on L.A. Noire began after the founding of developer Team Bondi in 2003 . Though Team Bondi oversaw development , work was shared between the core team and multiple other studios owned by publisher Rockstar Games . Unlike other games published by Rockstar , L.A. Noire uses a custom engine , which includes a combination of facial motion capture and animation software . The game also uses MotionScan to capture actor 's facial expressions . BBC News reporter Kev Geoghegan estimated that the development budget for the game exceeded US $ 50 million , making L.A. Noire one of the most expensive video games ever made . 
 L.A. Noire was developed for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 , and later ported to Microsoft Windows . Windows copies of the game are distributed on two DVD discs , while Xbox 360 copies are distributed on three ; the PlayStation 3 version fits onto one Blu @-@ Ray Disc . A total of 16 cases — the game 's form of missions that advance the game 's narrative — were removed from the final version of the game as they would not have fit on one Blu @-@ ray Disc ; while five of these cases were later released as downloadable content , eleven cases from the departments Bunko and Burglary were completely removed . 
 = = = Technical development = = = 
 While most games published by Rockstar since Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis ( 2006 ) use the proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine , L.A. Noire uses a custom engine , which includes a combination of motion capture and animation software . The game also utilises Havok for the animation and physics . 
 L.A. Noire is notable for being the first game to use the newly developed technology MotionScan , developed by Australian company Depth Analysis . MotionScan is a motion capture technology that records the face of an actor at over 1000 frames per second . This technology is crucial to the game 's interrogation mechanic , which requires players to use suspects ' facial reactions to questioning to judge whether or not they are lying . MotionScan functions by recording actors with 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle , resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a moving human face . Despite using 32 cameras , not all are required ; Oliver Bao , head of Depth Analysis R & D , said that the extra samples allow the team to " reconstruct a better 3D surface in general " and to " remove reconstruction noise a little more easily " . 
 Although the use of MotionScan was critically acclaimed for its highly realistic capture of faces , it was criticised for its inability to capture body movements . Many players considered that characters are " dead from the neck down " . Game director Brendan McNamara attributed this to players ' expectations of realism ; " people expect to see clothes moving and the rest of the body moving in a way we can 't replicate in video games , " he said . " We would have loved to have spent more time on fine @-@ tuning that for L.A. Noire but it wasn 't feasible due to the scope of the scripting and talent involved , " said Bao . 
 = = = Research and open world design = = = 
 For L.A. Noire , the development team recreated 1940s Los Angeles by using aerial photographs taken by daredevil Robert Spence . In a career spanning over 50 years , Spence took over 110 @,@ 000 aerial photographs of Los Angeles . The team used the photographs to create traffic patterns and public transport routes , as well as the location and condition of buildings . While striving to recreate an accurate model of 1947 Los Angeles , the team also took some artistic license , such as including the appearance of the film set for D. W. Griffith 's Intolerance ; the set had actually been dismantled in 1919 . 
 Los Angeles was extensively researched for the game . The team spent the first year of development researching Los Angeles by using newspapers and magazines , organising field research field trips , and capturing photographs . A total of 180 @,@ 000 photographs were available as resources throughout development , and over 1 @,@ 000 newspapers were used for research . Both the interior and exterior of multiple sets were the result of researched reference material . For example , the Barclay Hotel in Los Angeles was used as a reference point when modelling an apartment building in the game . However , some sets were originally designed , in order to meet the gameplay or the narrative script . 
 = = = Character development = = = 
 L.A. Noire has over twenty hours of voice work . To cast the characters , the team held secretive auditions . In the game , Aaron Staton portrayed Cole Phelps , Gil McKinney portrayed Jack Kelso , Rodney Scott portrayed Ralph Dunn , Sean McGowan portrayed Stefan Bekowsky , Michael McGrady portrayed Rusty Galloway , Adam Harrington portrayed Roy Earle , and Keith Szarabajka portrayed Herschel Biggs . Singer and model Erika <unk> and actor Andrew Connolly also appear as Elsa <unk> and Captain James Donnelly , respectively . Many of Staton 's Mad Men co @-@ stars are also featured in the game , including Vincent Kartheiser , Rich Sommer , Michael Gladis , Patrick Fischler and Morgan Rusler . Their performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology . During their performances , the actors attempted to appear as realistic as possible . Director Michael <unk> said , " I try to monitor the performances to make sure we ’ re getting the human element that ’ s going to make it compelling and interesting . " Initially , McNamara was not keen about the casting of Staton , but Rockstar Vice President for Creativity Dan Houser convinced him into agreeing . " [ Cole Phelps ] is conflicted and has quite a bit of depth and [ Staton ] is great at conveying those things , " said McNamara . 
 When discussing the player character change near the end of the story , from Phelps to Kelso , McNamara explained that the narrative " got to the point where [ Phelps ] couldn 't really do much more , and you have to go outside the realm of being a cop to bend the rules " . He stated that , when players performed poorly , the game was set to allow them to become a " rogue cop " , in which they must defend themselves against other police officers ; this feature was removed from the game during development as the team felt that it was " massively out of character " . 
 Prior to performing , Staton received a 12 @-@ page document that outlined the story , and the history of Phelps . He has said that he received the document as there wasn 't enough time to read the 2 @,@ 200 @-@ page script before filming began . Staton cumulatively worked on L.A. Noire for about eighteen months . He said , " consecutively I think I worked six months , and then for the next year here and there picking things up , adding , changing and tweaking things " . When discussing his character , McGowan felt that Bekowsky was initially jealous of Phelps , but eventually warmed up to him . " Like a good older brother he 'll always have his back but will never take shit from him , " he said . McGrady , who portrayed Rusty Galloway , said his own introverted personality helped him connect to the character . " I am a classic introvert but I can hold court when I need to . I think Rusty is that way too , " McGrady said . Harrington described Roy as " jaded , tough , mean , cruel , brutally honest and ... very funny " . He took credit for all of Roy 's facial expressions , but said that all of the dialogue was scripted , as opposed to ad @-@ lib . Many characters in the game are influenced by real people and events ; for example , Captain Donnelly is loosely based on both McNamara 's father , and LAPD Captain Jack Donahue . Additionally , many cases that Phelps solves are based off real life events , such as the Black Dahlia case . 
 = = = Music production = = = 
 L.A. Noire features an original score . The game 's score accompanies the gameplay , alerting players at specific times . Like other games published by Rockstar , L.A. Noire also contains licensed music tracks provided by an in @-@ game radio . Over thirty songs , from artists such as Billie Holiday , Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald , feature in the game . To work on the score , the team engaged Andrew Hale and Simon Hale , as well as Woody Jackson , who had previously collaborated with the team on Red Dead Redemption ( 2010 ) . Recorded at Abbey Road Studios , the score was inspired by orchestral scores from 1940s films . In addition to the original score and licensed tracks , the game also features original vocal recordings in order to create an authentic sound to suit the musical identity of the period . When The Real Tuesday Weld were commissioned to compose the original compositions , they sought vocals that could " evoke the period " , ultimately falling upon Claudia Brücken . Three vocal tracks were produced : " ( I Always Kill ) The Things I Love " , " Guilty " , and " Torched Song " . 
 Music supervisor Ivan Pavlovich stated that Rockstar 's focus on authenticity and realism inspired the composers to reflect the focus in the music . Andrew Hale felt that composing the game 's score was a flexible process " about setting a mood " , as opposed to a " mechanical " process in which the music was specifically composed to fit with the time frames of the game ; the composers decided to focus on the latter after the music was produced . They also attempted to compose something that felt accessible to players , avoiding exclusively focusing on swing or jazz . Andrew Hale felt that the orchestral score assisted in this .

 In October 2003 , Team Soho 's director of The Getaway Brendan McNamara left the London company to form his own studio in his native Australia . The six @-@ person studio , Team Bondi , immediately announced their first project , for " a next @-@ generation Sony platform " . In 2004 , McNamara said that the project was wholly funded by Sony Computer Entertainment America . The game 's title and platform was revealed in 2005 : L.A. Noire was to be released exclusively to the PlayStation 3 . Team Bondi described the game as a " detective thriller " . In September 2006 , it was announced that Rockstar Games would be handling the publishing of the game ; Rockstar only referred to it as a " next @-@ generation crime thriller " , with no platforms specified . 
 In June 2007 , Rockstar 's parent company Take @-@ Two Interactive re @-@ confirmed the release of the PlayStation 3 version by listing the game amongst its " announced to date " titles for " fiscal 2008 " .

 The game was extensively marketed through video trailers and press demonstrations . For its February 2010 issue , Game Informer magazine ran a cover story on L.A. Noire . On 12 November 2010 , the debut trailer was released . It depicted several scenes from the game , partly narrated by one of the characters , Herschel Biggs ( Keith Szarabajka ) . On 16 December 2010 , the first behind @-@ the @-@ scenes development video for the game was released , titled " The Technology Behind Performance " . It showcased the MotionScan technology used in the game , featuring interviews with the cast and development team . The second trailer was released on 24 January 2011 , particularly focusing on the game 's Homicide cases . A trailer released on 9 February 2011 , titled " Orientation " , featured the first gameplay footage of L.A. Noire . It demonstrated the game 's interrogation and investigation mechanics , and exhibited the game 's combat element . The game 's cover art was unveiled on 23 February 2011 , followed by the announcement of the game 's exclusive pre @-@ order content . 
 Trailers for the game 's exclusive pre @-@ order cases were released on 3 March and 31 March . The game 's investigation and interrogation aspects were further showcased in a gameplay trailer released on 9 March 2011 , titled " Investigation and Interrogation " . The game was exhibited at PAX in March 2011 . An exclusive theatre presentation was displayed at the L.A. Noire booth . The third trailer was released on 8 April 2011 , particularly focusing on the game 's depiction of the police department 's corruption in the Administrative Vice department . The final pre @-@ launch trailer was released on 11 May 2011 . 
 Viral marketing strategies were used to market the game . The official L.A. Noire website was redesigned on 27 January 2011 to show a preview of characters and cases in the game . On 25 April 2011 , L.A. Noire was honoured as an official selection at the Tribeca Film Festival , becoming the first video game to do so . Rockstar also ran a competition to win a trip to Los Angeles to attend the Festival of Film Noir Grauman 's Egyptian Theatre , and play the game a month before its official release . L.A. Noire was the focus of the 15 April 2011 episode of GameTrailers TV with Geoff Keighley , which featured interviews with the development team and previews of the MotionScan technology . 
 To encourage pre @-@ order sales of the game , Rockstar collaborated with several retail outlets to provide pre @-@ order bonuses . These included the extra cases " A Slip of the Tongue " and " The Naked City " , the side quest " The Badge Pursuit Challenge " , and the bonus detective suits " The Broderick " and " The Sharpshooter " . Rockstar Games and L.A. Noire shirts were also offered as pre @-@ order bonuses . In addition to the pre @-@ order bonuses , the extra case " The Consul 's Car " was included in all North American copies of the PlayStation 3 version ; it later became available for purchase from the PlayStation Store , and as part of The Complete Edition . On 6 June 2011 , Rockstar teamed up with Mulholland Books to publish L.A. Noire : The Collected Stories , a collection of short stories from noted crime authors , all based on the L.A. Noire universe . 
 = = = Staff complaints = = = 
 Shortly after the launch of the game , a group of former Team Bondi employees launched a website called <unk> , containing over 100 names which had been excluded or incorrectly listed in the official game credits . This was later followed by a series of claims and counter @-@ claims about working hours and company managerial style during the game 's development . Anonymous members of the development team publicly discussed the managerial style of the studio , the studio 's staff turnover rates and the working hours and conditions associated with L.A. Noire . 
 In July 2011 , a series of confidential emails were leaked along with further comments from staff members . They claimed the emails highlight the contentious relationship between Team Bondi and Rockstar , and indicate that the two companies are unlikely to work together again . An anonymous source from the development team claimed that " it has been quite clear that [ Rockstar ] will not publish Team Bondi 's next game " , and that " the relationship with Rockstar has been badly damaged " . The source claimed : 
 Part of the conflict between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstar 's frustration with Team Bondi 's direction , and eventually Team Bondi 's management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control . It 's also worth pointing out that Rockstar used to be very keen on making Team Bondi something like ' Rockstar Sydney ' - the more they worked with Team Bondi management , the more they came to understand that this was a terrible idea . 
 Team Bondi was placed into administration in August 2011 , and was wound up in October 2011 . The company 's assets were all bought by Kennedy Miller Mitchell , including McNamara 's next game , titled Whore of the Orient . Rockstar retained the L.A. Noire intellectual property . Some Team Bondi former employees went on to work for different Rockstar studios , while some went to Kennedy Miller Mitchell . Despite the allegedly difficult relationship during development , McNamara maintains an optimistic attitude towards Rockstar . " I 've no hard feelings about Rockstar and hopefully it doesn 't have any hard feelings about us , " he said . 
 = William Hanna = 
 William Denby " Bill " Hanna ( July 14 , 1910 – March 22 , 2001 ) was an American animator , director , producer , voice actor , and cartoon artist , whose film and television cartoon characters entertained millions of people for much of the 20th century . 
 After working odd jobs in the first months of the Depression , Hanna joined the Harman and Ising animation studio in 1930 . During the 1930s , Hanna steadily gained skill and prominence while working on cartoons such as Captain and the Kids . In 1937 , while working at Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer ( MGM ) , Hanna met Joseph Barbera . The two men began a collaboration that was at first best known for producing Tom and Jerry and live action / animated hybrid films . In 1957 , they co @-@ founded Hanna @-@ Barbera , which became the most successful television animation studio in the business , producing programs such as The Flintstones , The Huckleberry Hound Show , The Jetsons , Scooby @-@ Doo , The Smurfs , and Yogi Bear . In 1967 , Hanna – Barbera was sold to Taft Broadcasting for $ 12 million , but Hanna and Barbera remained heads of the company until 1991 . At that time , the studio was sold to Turner Broadcasting System , which in turn was merged with Time Warner in 1996 ; Hanna and Barbera stayed on as advisors . 
 Hanna and Barbera won seven Academy Awards and eight Emmy Awards . Their cartoons have become cultural icons , and their cartoon characters have appeared in other media such as films , books , and toys . Hanna – Barbera 's shows had a worldwide audience of over 300 million people in their 1960s heyday , and have been translated into more than 28 languages . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 William Hanna was born to William John and <unk> Joyce ( Denby ) Hanna on July 14 , 1910 in Melrose , New Mexico . He was the third of seven children and the only son . Hanna claimed there was no " war between the sexes " nor sibling rivalry in their home . Hanna described his family as " a red @-@ blooded , Irish @-@ American family " . His father was a construction superintendent for railroads as well as water and sewer systems throughout the western regions of America , requiring the family to move frequently . 
 When Hanna was three years old , the family moved to Baker City , Oregon , where his father worked on the Balm Creek Dam . It was here that Hanna developed his love of the outdoors . The family moved to Logan , Utah , before moving to San Pedro , California , in 1917 . During the next two years they moved several times before eventually settling in Watts , California , in 1919 . 
 In 1922 , while living in Watts , he joined Scouting . He attended Compton High School from 1925 through 1928 , where he played the saxophone in a dance band . His passion for music carried over into his career ; he helped write songs for his cartoons , including the theme for The Flintstones . Hanna became an Eagle Scout as a youth and remained active in Scouting throughout his life . As an adult , he served as a Scoutmaster and was recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with their Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in 1985 . Despite his numerous career @-@ related awards , Hanna was most proud of this Distinguished Eagle Scout Award . His interests also included sailing and singing in a barbershop quartet . Hanna studied both journalism and structural engineering at Compton City College , but had to drop out of college with the onset of the Great Depression . 
 On August 7 , 1936 , Hanna married Violet Blanch <unk> ( Born : July 23 , 1913 , Died July 11 , 2014 . ) , and they had a marriage lasting 64 years and they had two children , David William and Bonnie Jean , and seven grandchildren . In 1996 , Hanna , with assistance from Los Angeles writer Tom Ito , published his autobiography — Joe Barbera had published his two years earlier .

 After dropping out of college , Hanna worked briefly as a construction engineer and helped build the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood . He lost that job during the Great Depression and found another at a car wash . His sister 's boyfriend encouraged him to apply for a job at Pacific Title and Art , which produced title cards for motion pictures . While working there , Hanna 's talent for drawing became evident , and in 1930 he joined the Harman and Ising animation studio , which had created the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series . Despite a lack of formal training , Hanna soon became head of their ink and paint department . Besides inking and painting , Hanna also wrote songs and lyrics . For the first several years of Hanna 's employment , the studio partnered with Pacific Title and Art 's Leon Schlesinger , who released the Harman @-@ Ising output through Warner Bros. When Hugh Harman and Rudolph Ising chose to break with Schlesinger and begin producing cartoons independently for Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer ( MGM ) in 1933 , Hanna was one of the employees who followed them . 
 Hanna was given the opportunity to direct his first cartoon in 1936 ; the result was To Spring , part of the Harman @-@ Ising Happy Harmonies series . The following year , MGM decided to terminate their partnership with Harman @-@ Ising and bring production in @-@ house . Hanna was among the first people MGM hired away from Harman @-@ Ising to their new cartoon studio . During 1938 – 39 , he served as a senior director on MGM 's Captain and the Kids series , based upon the comic strip of the same name ( an alternate version of the Katzenjammer Kids that had resulted from a 1914 lawsuit ) . The series did not do well ; consequently , Hanna was demoted to a story man and the series was canceled . Hanna 's desk at MGM was opposite that of Joseph Barbera , who had previously worked at Terrytoons . The two quickly realized they would make a good team . By 1939 they had solidified a partnership that would last over 60 years . Hanna and Barbera worked alongside animation director Tex Avery , who had created Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. and directed Droopy cartoons at MGM .

 In 1940 , Hanna and Barbera jointly directed Puss Gets the Boot , which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best ( Cartoon ) Short Subject . The studio wanted a diversified cartoon portfolio , so despite the success of Puss Gets the Boot , Hanna and Barbera 's supervisor , Fred Quimby , did not want to produce more cat and mouse cartoons . Surprised by the success of Puss Gets the Boot , Hanna and Barbera ignored Quimby 's resistance and continued developing the cat @-@ and @-@ mouse theme . By this time , however , Hanna wanted to return to working for Ising , to whom he felt very loyal . Hanna and Barbera met with Quimby , who discovered that although Ising had taken sole credit for producing Puss Gets the Boot , he never actually worked on it . Quimby then gave Hanna and Barbera permission to pursue their cat @-@ and @-@ mouse idea . The result was their most famous creation , Tom and Jerry . 
 Modeled after the Puss Gets the Boot characters with slight differences , the series followed Jerry , the rodent who continually outwitted his feline foe , Tom . Hanna said they settled on the cat and mouse theme for this cartoon because : " We knew we needed two characters . We thought we needed conflict , and chase and action . And a cat after a mouse seemed like a good , basic thought . " The revamped characters first appeared in 1941 's The Midnight Snack . Over the next 17 years Hanna and Barbera worked almost exclusively on Tom and Jerry , directing more than 114 highly popular cartoon shorts . During World War II they also made animated training films . Tom and Jerry relied mostly on motion instead of dialog . Despite its popularity , Tom and Jerry has often been criticized as excessively violent . Nonetheless , the series won its first Academy Award for the 11th short , The Yankee Doodle Mouse ( 1943 ) — a war @-@ time adventure . Tom and Jerry was ultimately nominated for 14 Academy Awards , winning 7 . No other character @-@ based theatrical animated series has won more awards , nor has any other series featuring the same characters . Tom and Jerry also made guest appearances in several of MGM 's live @-@ action films , including Anchors Aweigh ( 1945 ) and Invitation to the Dance ( 1956 ) with Gene Kelly , and Dangerous When Wet ( 1953 ) with Esther Williams . 
 Quimby accepted each Academy Award for Tom and Jerry 's without inviting Hanna and Barbera onstage . The cartoons were also released with Quimby listed as the sole producer , following the same practice for which he had condemned Ising . When Quimby retired in late 1955 , Hanna and Barbera were placed in charge of MGM 's animation division . As the studio began to lose more revenue due to television , MGM soon realized that re @-@ releasing old cartoons was far more profitable than producing new ones . In 1957 , MGM ordered Hanna and Barbera 's business manager to close the cartoon division and lay off everyone by a phone call . Hanna and Barbera found the no @-@ notice closing puzzling because Tom and Jerry had been so successful . 
 = = Television = = 
 During his last year at MGM , Hanna branched out into television , forming the short @-@ lived company Shield Productions with fellow animator Jay Ward , who had created the series Crusader Rabbit . Their partnership soon ended , and in 1957 Hanna reteamed with Joseph Barbera to produce cartoons for television and theatrical release . The two brought different skills to the company ; Barbera was a skilled gag writer and sketch artist , while Hanna had a gift for timing , story construction , and recruiting top artists . Major business decisions would be made together , though each year the title of president alternated between them . A coin toss determined that Hanna would have precedence in the naming of the new company , first called H @-@ B Enterprises but soon changed to Hanna – Barbera Productions . Barbera and Hanna 's MGM colleague George Sidney , the director of Anchors Aweigh , became the third partner and business manager in the company , and arranged a deal for distribution and working capital with Screen Gems , the television division of Columbia Pictures , who took part ownership of the new studio . 
 The first offering from the new company was The Ruff & Reddy Show , a series which detailed the friendship between a dog and cat . Despite a lukewarm response for their first theatrical venture , Loopy De Loop , Hanna – Barbera soon established themselves with two successful television series : The Huckleberry Hound Show and The Yogi Bear Show . A 1960 survey showed that half of the viewers of Huckleberry Hound were adults . This prompted the company to create a new animated series , The Flintstones . A parody of The Honeymooners , the new show followed a typical Stone Age family with home appliances , talking animals , and celebrity guests . With an audience of both children and adults , The Flintstones became the first animated prime @-@ time show to be a hit . Fred Flintstone 's signature exclamation " <unk> <unk> doo " soon entered everyday usage , and the show boosted the studio to the top of the TV cartoon field . The company later produced a space @-@ age version of The Flintstones , known as The Jetsons . Although both shows reappeared in the 1970s and 1980s , The Flintstones was far more popular . 
 By the late 1960s , Hanna – Barbera Productions was the most successful television animation studio in the business . The Hanna – Barbera studio produced over 3000 animated half @-@ hour television shows . Among the more than 100 cartoon series and specials they produced were : Atom Ant , Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy ( an imitation of the earlier Spike and <unk> MGM cartoons ) , Jonny Quest , Josie and the Pussycats , <unk> Gorilla , Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks , Quick Draw McGraw , and Top Cat . Top Cat was based on Phil Silvers 's character Sgt. Bilko , though it has been erroneously reported that Sgt. Bilko was the basis for Yogi Bear . The Hanna – Barbera studio also produced Scooby @-@ Doo ( 1969 – 1986 ) and The Smurfs ( 1981 – 1989 ) . The company also produced animated specials based on Alice in Wonderland , Jack and the Beanstalk , Cyrano de Bergerac as well as the feature @-@ length film Charlotte 's Web ( 1973 ) . 
 As popular as their cartoons were with 1960s audiences , they were disliked by artists . Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation , and this economic reality caused many animation studios to go out of business in the 1950s and 1960s , putting many people in the industry out of work . Hanna – Barbera was key in the development of limited animation , which allowed television animation to be more cost @-@ effective , but also reduced quality . Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques in the early days of Tom and Jerry . To reduce the cost of each episode , shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation . The number of drawings for a seven @-@ minute cartoon decreased from 14 @,@ 000 to nearly 2 @,@ 000 , and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing . Reviewers criticized the change from vivid , detailed animation to repetitive movements by two @-@ dimensional characters . Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers . The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows , enabling Hanna – Barbera to stay in business , providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work . Limited animation became the standard for television animation , and continues to be used today in television programs such as The Simpsons and South Park . 
 In 1966 , Hanna – Barbera Productions was sold to Taft Broadcasting ( renamed Great American Communications in 1987 ) for $ 12 million . Hanna and Barbera remained at the head of the company until 1991 . At that point , the company was sold to the Turner Broadcasting System for an estimated $ 320 million , which itself merged with Time Warner , owners of Warner Bros. , in 1996 . This began a close association with the Cartoon Network . Hanna and Barbera continued to advise their former company and periodically worked on new Hanna – Barbera shows , including The Cartoon Cartoon Show series and hit silver screen versions of The Flintstones ( 1994 ) and Scooby @-@ Doo ( 2002 ) . 
 = = Death = = 
 Hanna died of throat cancer on March 22 , 2001 , in North Hollywood , Los Angeles , California . After his death , Cartoon Network aired a 20 @-@ second segment with black dots tracing Hanna 's portrait with the words " We 'll miss you – Cartoon Network " fading in on the right @-@ hand side . This same type of tribute was done for Chuck Jones in 2002 and Hanna 's partner , Joseph Barbera in 2006 , when each of them died . However , Barbera , unlike the other two , had an audio clip of his voice playing in his Cartoon Network tribute . Hanna is buried at Ascension Cemetery in Lake Forest , California . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Most of the cartoons Hanna and Barbera created revolved around close friendship or partnership ; this theme is evident with Tom and Jerry , Yogi Bear and Boo Boo , Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble , Ruff and Reddy , The Jetsons family and Scooby @-@ Doo and Shaggy Rogers , as well as Cartoon Network characters that Hanna @-@ Barbera created such as Johnny Bravo and Carl , Cow and Chicken and their schoolmates Flem and Earl , I.M. Weasel and <unk> <unk> , Dexter and his supercomputers , and the Powerpuff Girls . These may have been a reflection of the close business friendship and partnership that Hanna and Barbera shared for almost 60 years . Professionally , they balanced each other 's strengths and weaknesses very well , but Hanna and Barbera traveled in completely different social circles . Hanna 's personal friends primarily included other animators ; Barbera tended to socialize with Hollywood celebrities . Their division of work roles complemented each other but they rarely talked outside of work since Hanna was interested in the outdoors and Barbera liked beaches , good food and drink . Nevertheless , in their long partnership , in which they worked with over 2000 animated characters , Hanna and Barbera rarely exchanged a cross word . Barbera said : " We understood each other perfectly , and each of us had deep respect for the other 's work . " 
 Hanna is considered one of the all @-@ time great animators and on a par with Tex Avery . Hanna and Barbera were among the most successful animators on the cinema screen and successfully adapted to the change television brought to the industry . Leonard Maltin says the Hanna – Barbera team " [ may ] hold a record for producing consistently superior cartoons using the same characters year after year — without a break or change in routine . Their characters are not only animated superstars , but also a very beloved part of American pop culture " . They are often considered as Walt Disney 's only rivals as cartoonists . 
 Hanna and Barbera had a lasting impact on television animation . Cartoons they created often make greatest lists . Many of their characters have appeared in film , books , toys , and other media . During the 1960s their TV shows had a worldwide audience of over 300 million people and have since been translated into more than 20 languages . The works of Hanna and Barbera also have been recognized for their music , such as The Cat Concerto ( 1946 ) and Johann Mouse ( 1952 ) , called " masterpieces of animation " in part due to their use of classical music . 
 In all , the Hanna – Barbera team won seven Academy Awards and eight Emmy Awards , including the 1960 award for The Huckleberry Hound Show , which was the first Emmy awarded to an animated series . They also won these awards : Golden Globe for Television Achievement ( 1960 ) , Golden <unk> Award — Pacific Pioneers in Broadcasting ( 1983 ) , Pioneer Award — Broadcast Music Incorporated ( 1987 ) , Iris Award — <unk> Men of the Year ( 1988 ) , Licensing Industry Merchandisers ' Association Award for Lifetime Achievement ( 1988 ) , Governors Award of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences ( 1988 ) , Jackie Coogan Award for Outstanding Contribution to Youth through Entertainment Youth in Film ( 1988 ) , Frederic W. Ziv Award for Outstanding Achievement in Telecommunications — Broadcasting Division College — Conservatory of Music University of Cincinnati ( 1989 ) , stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame ( 1976 ) , several Annie Awards , several environmental awards , and were recipients of numerous other accolades prior to their induction into the Television Hall of Fame in 1994 . In March 2005 the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and Warner Bros. Animation dedicated a wall sculpture at the Television Academy 's Hall of Fame Plaza in North Hollywood to Hanna and Barbera . Hanna 's archive audio of Tom Cat 's screams have been reused recently in the new 2014 Tom and Jerry Show . 
 = John Adair = 
 John Adair ( January 9 , 1757 – May 19 , 1840 ) was an American pioneer , soldier , and politician . He was the eighth Governor of Kentucky and represented the state in both the U.S. House and Senate . A native of South Carolina , Adair enlisted in the state militia and served in the Revolutionary War , during which he was twice captured and held as a prisoner of war by the British . Following the War , he was elected as a delegate to South Carolina 's convention to ratify the United States Constitution . 
 After moving to Kentucky in 1786 , Adair participated in the Northwest Indian War , including a skirmish with the Miami Chief Little Turtle near Fort St. Clair in 1792 . Popular for his service in two wars , he entered politics in 1792 as a delegate to Kentucky 's constitutional convention . Adair was elected to a total of eight terms in the state House of Representatives between 1793 and 1803 . He served as Speaker of the Kentucky House in 1802 and 1803 , and was a delegate to the state 's Second Constitutional Convention in 1799 . He ascended to the United States Senate to fill the seat vacated when John Breckinridge resigned to become Attorney General of the United States in the Cabinet of Thomas Jefferson , but failed to win a full term in the subsequent election due to his implication in a treason conspiracy involving Vice President Aaron Burr . After a long legal battle , he was acquitted of any wrongdoing ; and his accuser , General James Wilkinson , was ordered to issue an apology . The negative publicity kept him out of politics for more than a decade . 
 Adair 's participation in the War of 1812 , and a subsequent protracted defense of Kentucky 's soldiers against General Andrew Jackson 's charges that they showed cowardice at the Battle of New Orleans , restored his reputation . He returned to the State House in 1817 , and Isaac Shelby , his commanding officer in the War who was serving a second term as governor , appointed him adjutant general of the state militia . In 1820 , Adair was elected eighth governor on a platform of financial relief for Kentuckians hit hard by the Panic of 1819 , and the ensuing economic recession . His primary effort toward this end was the creation of the Bank of the Commonwealth , but many of his other financial reforms were deemed unconstitutional by the Kentucky Court of Appeals , touching off the Old Court – New Court controversy . Following his term as governor , Adair served one undistinguished term in the United States House of Representatives and did not run for re @-@ election . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John Adair was born January 9 , 1757 , in Chester County , South Carolina , a son of Scottish immigrants Baron William and Mary [ Moore ] Adair . He was educated at schools in Charlotte , North Carolina , and enlisted in the South Carolina colonial militia at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War . He was assigned to the regiment of his friend , Edward Lacey , under the command of Colonel Thomas Sumter and participated in the failed Colonial assault on a Loyalist outpost at the Battle of Rocky Mount and the subsequent Colonial victory at the Battle of Hanging Rock . During the British victory over the Colonists at the August 16 , 1780 , Battle of Camden , Adair was taken as a prisoner of war . He contracted smallpox and was treated harshly by his captors during his months @-@ long imprisonment . Although he escaped at one point , Adair was unable to reach safety because of difficulties related to his smallpox infection and was recaptured by British Colonel Banastre Tarleton after just three days . Subsequently , he was released via a prisoner exchange . In 1781 , he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the South Carolina militia , and fought in the drawn Battle of Eutaw Springs , the war 's last major battle in the Carolinas . Edward Lacey was elected sheriff of Chester County after the war , and Adair replaced him in his former capacity as the county 's justice of the peace . He was chosen as a delegate to the South Carolina convention to ratify the U.S. Constitution . 
 In 1784 , Adair married Katherine Palmer . They had twelve children , ten of them daughters . One married Thomas Bell Monroe , who later served as Adair 's Secretary of State and was appointed to a federal judgeship . In 1786 , the <unk> migrated westward to Kentucky , settling in Mercer County . 
 = = Service in the Northwest Indian War = = 
 Enlisting for service as a captain in the Northwest Indian War in 1791 , Adair was soon promoted to major and assigned to the brigade of James Wilkinson . On November 6 , 1792 , a band of Miamis under the command of Little Turtle encountered Adair and about 100 men serving under him on a scouting mission near Fort St. Clair in Ohio . When the Miami attacked , Adair ordered Lieutenant ( and later governor of Kentucky ) George Madison to attack their right flank while Adair led 25 men to attack the left flank . ( Adair had intended for a subordinate to lead the charge , but the officer was killed before Adair could give the order . ) The maneuver forced the Miamis to fall back and allowed Adair 's men to escape . They retreated to their camp and made a stand , forcing the Miamis to withdraw . Six of Adair 's men were killed ; another four were missing and five were wounded . Among the wounded were Madison and Richard Taylor , father of future U.S. President Zachary Taylor . 
 Recognizing his bravery and fighting skill , Adair 's superiors promoted him to lieutenant colonel . He was assigned to the command of Charles Scott , who would eventually serve as Kentucky 's fourth governor . He assisted in the construction of Fort Greeneville in 1794 , forwarding supplies to Anthony Wayne during his operations which ended in a decisive victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers . 
 = = Early political career = = 
 Popular for his military service , Adair was chosen as a delegate to the Kentucky constitutional convention in 1792 . Upon the state 's admission to the Union , he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives , serving from 1793 to 1795 . He remained active in the Kentucky militia , and on February 25 , 1797 , he was promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 2nd Brigade of the Kentucky Militia . He was promoted to major general and given command of the 2nd Division of the Kentucky Militia on December 16 , 1799 . 
 Adair returned to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1798 . When Kentuckians voted to hold another constitutional convention in 1799 to correct weaknesses in their first constitution , Adair was chosen as a delegate . At the convention , he was the leader of a group of politically ambitious delegates who opposed most limits on the powers and terms of office of elected officials , particularly on legislators . He was elected to the Kentucky House again from 1800 to 1803 . A candidate for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1800 , he was defeated in an overwhelming 68 – 13 vote of the legislature by John Breckinridge , who had been the acknowledged leader of the just @-@ concluded constitutional convention . In 1802 , Adair succeeded Breckinridge as Speaker of the House by a vote of 30 – 14 over Elder David Purviance , the candidate preferred by Governor James Garrard . He continued to serve as Speaker for the duration of his tenure in the House . In 1802 , the legislature formed Adair County , Kentucky , naming it after the popular Speaker . 
 In January 1804 , Garrard nominated Adair to the position of registrar of the state land office . Adair 's was the seventh name submitted by Garrard to the state Senate for the position ; his approval by the Senate marked the end of a two @-@ month imbroglio between Garrard and the legislature over the appointment . Later that year , he was a candidate for the U.S. Senate seat then occupied by John Brown . Although Henry Clay supported Brown 's re @-@ election , Adair had the support of Felix Grundy . Grundy accused Brown of involvement in a conspiracy to make Kentucky a province of the Spanish government , damaging his popularity . Adair won a plurality , but not a majority , of the votes cast in six consecutive ballots . Clay then threw his support to Buckner Thruston , a more palatable candidate who defeated Adair on the seventh ballot . Grundy 's influence in the legislature continued to grow , and when John Breckinridge resigned to accept President Thomas Jefferson 's appointment as U.S. Attorney General in August 1805 , the Senate chose Adair to fill the vacancy . 
 = = Charged with disloyalty = = 
 Former Vice @-@ President Aaron Burr visited Kentucky in 1805 , reaching Frankfort , Kentucky , on May 25 and lodging with former Senator John Brown . During the trip , he consulted with many prominent politicians , Adair among them , about the possibility of wresting Mexico from Spain . Most of those he spoke with believed he was acting on behalf of the federal government and intended to expand U.S. holdings in Mexico . Adair believed this too , having received letters from his former commander , James Wilkinson , which appeared to confirm it . In 1806 , however , Burr was arrested in Frankfort on charges of treason . Officials claimed he in fact intended to create a new , independent nation in Spanish lands . 
 Convinced of his innocence , Henry Clay represented Burr , while Joseph Hamilton Daveiss acted as prosecutor . Harry Innes presided over the trial , which commenced November 11 . Daveiss had to ask for a postponement because Davis Floyd , one of his key witnesses , was then serving in the Indiana General Assembly and could not be present in court . The court next convened on December 2 , and Daveiss again had to ask for a postponement , this time because Adair , another witness , was not present . Adair had traveled to Louisiana to inspect a tract of land he had recently purchased there . On his arrival in New Orleans , he was arrested on the order of his former commander , James Wilkinson , then serving as governor of the Louisiana Territory . 
 Clay had insisted that the trial proceed in Adair 's absence , and , the next day , Daveiss presented indictments against Burr for treason and against Adair as a co @-@ conspirator . After hearing testimony , the grand jury rejected the indictment against Adair as " not a true bill " and similarly dismissed the charges against Burr two days later . After his vindication by the grand jury , Adair counter @-@ sued Wilkinson in federal court . Although the legal battle between the two spanned several years , the court found that Wilkinson had no solid evidence against Adair and ordered Wilkinson to issue a public apology and pay Adair $ 2 @,@ 500 in damages . Adair 's acquittal and successful counter @-@ suit came too late to prevent damage to his political career . Because of his association with Burr 's scheme , he lost the election for a full term in the Senate in November 1806 . Rather than wait for his partial term to expire , he resigned on November 18 , 1806 . 
 = = Service in the War of 1812 = = 
 Adair rejoined the Kentucky militia at the outset of the War of 1812 . After Oliver Hazard Perry 's victory in the September 10 , 1813 , Battle of Lake Erie , William Henry Harrison called on Kentucky Governor Isaac Shelby , a popular Revolutionary War hero , to recruit troops in Kentucky and join him in his invasion of Canada . Shelby asked Adair to serve as his first aide @-@ de @-@ camp . Future Kentucky governor and U.S. Senator John J. Crittenden was Shelby 's second aide , and future U.S. Senator and Postmaster General William T. Barry was his secretary . Adair rendered commendable service in the campaign , most notably at the American victory in the Battle of the Thames on October 5 , 1813 . Shelby praised Adair 's service and in 1814 , made him adjutant general of Kentucky and brevetted him to the rank of brigadier general . 
 In late 1814 , Andrew Jackson requested reinforcements from Kentucky for his defense of the Gulf of Mexico . Adair quickly raised three regiments , but the federal government provided them no weapons and no means of transportation . James Taylor , Jr . , then serving as quartermaster general of the state militia , took out a $ 6 @,@ 000 mortgage on his personal land to purchase boats to transport Adair 's men . The number of men with Adair was later disputed ; sources variously give numbers between 700 and 1 @,@ 500 . Many did not have weapons , and the ones who did were primarily armed with their own civilian rifles . John Thomas , to whom Adair was an adjunct , fell ill just before the battle commenced , leaving Adair responsible for all the Kentuckians present at the battle . 
 On January 7 , 1815 , Adair traveled to New Orleans and requested that the city 's leaders lend him several stands of arms from the city armory to arm his militiamen . The officials agreed under the condition that the removal of the arms from the armory be kept secret from the citizenry . The weapons were placed in boxes and delivered to Adair 's camp on the night of January 7 . At Adair 's suggestion , his men were placed in reserve and located centrally behind the Tennessee militiamen under William Carroll . From there , they could quickly move to reinforce whichever portion of the American line received the heaviest attack from the British . 
 Apparently unaware of Adair 's request , that evening , Jackson ordered 400 unarmed Kentucky militiamen under Colonel John Davis to march to New Orleans to obtain arms , then reinforce the 450 Louisiana militiamen under David B. Morgan on the west bank of the Mississippi River . When they arrived in New Orleans , they were told that the city 's arms had already been shipped to Adair . The citizens collected what weapons they had — mostly old muskets in various states of disrepair — and gave them to Davis ' men . About 200 men were thus armed and reported to Morgan as ordered , just hours before the start of the Battle of New Orleans . The remainder of Davis 's men returned to the main camp , still without weapons . 
 As the British approached on the morning of January 8 , it became evident that they would try to break the American line through Carroll 's Tennesseans , and Adair advanced his men to support them . The main American line held and repulsed the British attack ; in total , only six Americans were killed and seven wounded . Meanwhile , Davis ' Kentuckians on the west bank had , upon their arrival in Morgan 's camp , been sent to meet the advance of a secondary British force . Outnumbered , poorly armed , and without the benefit of breastworks or artillery support , they were quickly outflanked and forced to retreat . Seeing the retreat of the Kentuckians , Morgan 's militiamen abandoned their breastworks ; Adair would later claim they had never even fired a shot . The British quickly abandoned the position they had just captured , but Jackson resented the setback in an otherwise spectacular victory . 
 = = Controversy with Andrew Jackson = = 
 Jackson 's official report blamed the Kentuckians ' retreat for the collapse of the west bank defenses , and many Kentuckians felt it played down the importance of Adair 's militiamen on the east bank in preserving the American line and securing the victory . Davis ' men insisted the report was based on Jackson 's misunderstanding of the facts and asked that Adair request a court of inquiry , which convened in February 1815 with Major General Carroll of Tennessee presiding . The court 's report found that " [ t ] he retreat of the Kentucky militia , which , considering their position , the deficiency of their arms , and other causes , may be excusable , " and that the formation of the troops on the west bank was " exceptional " , noting that 500 Louisiana troops supported by three artillery pieces and protected by a strong breastwork were charged with defending a line that stretched only 200 yards ( 180 m ) while Davis 's 170 Kentuckians , poorly armed and protected only by a small ditch , were expected to defend a line over 300 yards ( 270 m ) long . On February 10 , 1816 , the Kentucky General Assembly passed a resolution thanking Adair for his service at the Battle of New Orleans and for his defense of the soldiers accused by Jackson . 
 Jackson approved the court 's findings , but they were not the full refutation of Jackson 's report that many Kentuckians — including Adair — had wanted . In a letter that was quickly made public , Adair — formerly one of Jackson 's close friends — insisted that Jackson withdraw or modify his official report , but Jackson refused . This ended the matter until June 1815 when H. P. Helm , secretary to John Thomas , forwarded to a Frankfort newspaper remarks from " the general " that had been annexed to the official report . " The remarks " stated that the general was now convinced that the initial reports of cowardice by Davis 's men " had been misrepresented " and that their retreat had been " not only excusable , but absolutely justifiable . " The remarks , popularly believed to be from Jackson in response to Adair 's letter , were subsequently reprinted across Kentucky . The " general " referenced was in fact General John Thomas ; Jackson had never seen them . Helm claimed he sent a subsequent correction to the newspaper that published the remarks , but it was never printed . 
 Jackson did not discover the remarks until they were published again in January 1817 in response to a Boston newspaper 's criticism of Kentucky militiamen . He wrote to the Kentucky Reporter at that time , denouncing the remarks as a forgery . The Reporter investigated and published an explanation of how Thomas 's remarks had been attributed to Jackson . They did not reprint Jackson 's letter because they felt his claim that the remarks had been intentionally forged — a charge which was now found to be false — was too inflammatory . The editors promised that if their retraction did not satisfy Jackson , they would fully publish any of his additional remarks on the subject . In Jackson 's April 1817 response , he implied that Adair had intentionally misrepresented the remarks , and reasserted that they had been forged , possibly by Adair himself . Adair believed Jackson 's references to the remarks as a " forged dish , dressed in the true Spanish style " was a thinly veiled reference to Adair 's alleged participation in the Burr conspiracy . As ostensible proof that he was not predisposed against Kentuckians , Jackson also implied that he had not reported additional dishonorable behavior by Kentucky militiamen during the battle . This letter thrust the dispute into the national spotlight and prompted Adair to resume correspondence with him both to defend Davis 's men and refute Jackson 's charges of conspiracy . In his May 1817 response , he reasserted his defense of the Kentucky militiamen at New Orleans and dismissed many of Jackson 's allegations as unimportant and untrue . He flatly denied the existence of a conspiracy , and chastised Jackson for making charges without supporting evidence . Responding to Jackson 's allusion to Spain , Adair recalled that Jackson had also been implicated with Burr . 
 Unable to provide tangible evidence of Adair 's alleged misdeeds , Jackson provided indirect evidence that a conspiracy was possible . His response , delayed by his treaty negotiations with the Cherokee , was printed September 3 , 1817 , and used complicated calculations based on spacing and distance , to argue that Adair had only half the number of men he claimed to have commanded at the Battle of New Orleans . Further , he claimed that Adair had ordered Davis to New Orleans to obtain weapons knowing that the arms had already been taken by other brigades under Adair 's command . Either Adair had given a foolish order , or he did not have as many men in his main force as he claimed . He closed by promising that this would be his last statement on the matter . Adair 's October 29 , 1817 , response was delayed , he said , because he was awaiting documents from New Orleans that never came . In it , he quoted from a letter to Jackson 's aide @-@ de @-@ camp — cited by Jackson himself in previous correspondence — showing that Jackson had been made aware of both the existence and the authorship of Thomas 's remarks in 1815 but declined the opportunity to refute them . He also defended his account of the number of troops under his command , which he had consistently reported as being near 1 @,@ 000 , and asked why Jackson had not challenged it until now . Finally , he claimed that not only did he retrieve the weapons from New Orleans under Jackson 's orders , but he rode Jackson 's horse to New Orleans to effect the transaction . Tradition holds that this letter prompted either Adair or Jackson to challenge the other to a duel , but friends of both men averted the conflict after assembling to watch ; no written evidence of the event exists . Tensions between the two eventually eased , and Adair came to comfort Jackson after his wife Rachel 's death in 1828 . Adair also campaigned for Jackson during his presidential campaigns in 1824 , 1828 , and 1832 . Jackson 's opponents compiled copies of his letters into campaign pamphlets to use against him in Kentucky during these elections .

 Adair 's participation in the War of 1812 and subsequent correspondence with Jackson restored his reputation . He continued to serve as adjutant general until 1817 , when the voters returned him to the state House of Representatives . He was nominated for Speaker of the House during that term , and , although he was not elected , he drew support from members of both parties , largely because of his correspondence with Jackson . 
 In the aftermath of the Panic of 1819 — the first major financial crisis in United States history — the primary political issue of the day was debt relief . The federal government had created the Second Bank of the United States in 1817 , and its strict credit policy hit Kentucky 's large debtor class hard . Sitting governor Gabriel Slaughter had lobbied for some measures favored by the state 's debtors , particularly punitive taxes against the branches of the Bank of the United States in Louisville and Lexington . The Second Party System had not yet developed , but there were nonetheless two opposing factions that arose around the debt relief issue . The first — primarily composed of land speculators who had bought large land parcels on credit and were unable to repay their debts due to the financial crisis — was dubbed the Relief Party ( or " faction " ) and favored more legislation favorable to debtors . Opposed to them was the Anti @-@ Relief Party ; it was composed primarily of the state 's aristocracy , many of whom were creditors to the land speculators and demanded that their contracts be adhered to without interference from the government . They claimed that no government intervention could effectively aid the debtors and that attempts to do so would only prolong the economic depression . 
 Adair was the clear leader of the Relief faction , and his popularity had been enhanced thanks to his lengthy and public dispute with Jackson . In the 1820 gubernatorial election , he was elected as Kentucky 's chief executive over three fellow Democratic @-@ Republicans . Adair garnered 20 @,@ 493 votes ; U.S. Senator William Logan finished second with 19 @,@ 497 , fellow veteran Joseph Desha received 12 @,@ 419 , and Colonel Anthony Butler mustered only 9 @,@ 567 votes . Proponents of debt relief measures also won majorities in both houses of the General Assembly . 
 = = = Debt relief = = = 
 Kentucky historian Lowell H. Harrison opined that the most important measure implemented during Adair 's administration was the creation of the Bank of the Commonwealth in 1820 . The bank made generous loans and liberally issued paper money . Although bank notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth quickly fell well below par , creditors who refused to accept these devalued notes had to wait two years before seeking replevin . To inspire confidence in the devalued notes , Adair mandated that all officers of the state receive their salaries in notes issued by the Bank of the Commonwealth . 
 The state 's other bank , the Bank of Kentucky , adhered to more conservative banking practices . While this held the value of its notes closer to par , it also rendered loans less available , which angered relief @-@ minded legislators ; consequently , they revoked the bank 's charter in December 1822 . Adair oversaw the abolition of the practice of incarceration for debt , and sanctioned rigorous anti @-@ gambling legislation . Legislators also exempted from forced sale the items then considered necessary for making a living — a horse , a plow , a hoe , and an ax . 
 The Kentucky Court of Appeals , then the state 's court of last resort , struck down the law ordering a two @-@ year stay of replevin because it impaired the obligation of contracts . At about the same time , the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in the case of Green v. Biddle , holding that land claims granted by Virginia in the District of Kentucky before Kentucky became a separate state took precedence over those later granted by the state of Kentucky if the two were in conflict . Adair denounced this decision in an 1823 message to the legislature , warning against federal and judicial interference in the will of the people , expressed through the legislature . Emboldened by Adair 's message , Relief partisans sought to remove the three justices of the state Court of Appeals , as well as James Clark , a lower court judge who had issued a similar ruling , from the bench . The judges were spared when their opponents failed to obtain the two @-@ thirds majority required for removal . 
 = = = Other matters of Adair 's term = = = 
 Adair urged legislators to create a public school system . In response , the General Assembly passed an act creating a state " Literary Fund " which received half of the clear profits accrued by the Bank of the Commonwealth . The fund was to be available , proportionally , to each of the state 's counties for the establishment of " a system of general education " . In the tumultuous economic environment , however , legislators routinely voted to borrow from the Literary Fund to pay for other priorities , chiefly the construction of internal improvements . 
 Adair 's lieutenant governor , William T. Barry , and John Pope , Secretary of State under Adair 's predecessor , headed a six @-@ man committee authorized by the act to study the creation of a system of common schools . The " Barry Report , " delivered to the legislature in December 1822 , was lauded by such luminaries as John Adams , Thomas Jefferson , and James Madison . Authored by committee member Amos Kendall , it criticized the idea of land grant academies then prevalent in the state as unworkable outside affluent towns . It also concluded that the Literary Fund alone was insufficient for funding a system of common schools . The report recommended that funds only be made available to counties that imposed a county tax for the benefit of the public school system . Legislators largely ignored the report , a decision Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark called " one of the most egregious blunders in American educational history " . 
 Adair 's endorsement of the Missouri Compromise was instrumental in securing its passage by Kentucky legislators . He advocated prison reform and better treatment of the insane . He also oversaw the enactment of a plan for internal improvements , including improved navigation on the Ohio River . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Barred from seeking immediate re @-@ election by the state constitution , Adair retired to his farm in Mercer County at the expiration of his term as governor . Shortly after returning to private life , he began to complain about the low value of Bank of the Commonwealth notes — then worth about half par — and petitioned the legislature to remedy the situation . The complaint of a former Relief Party governor over the ill effects of pro @-@ relief legislation prompted wry celebration among members of the Anti @-@ Relief faction . 
 Adair made one final contribution to the public when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Jackson Democrat in 1831 . During the 22nd Congress , he served on the Committee on Military Affairs . During his term , he made only one speech , and it was so inaudible that no one knew what position he was advocating . The House reporter speculated that it concerned mounting Federal troops on horseback . He did not run for re @-@ election in 1833 , and left public life for good . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 He died at home in Harrodsburg on May 19 , 1840 , and was buried on the grounds of his estate , White Hall . In 1872 , his remains were moved to the Frankfort Cemetery , by the state capitol , and the Commonwealth erected a marker over his grave there . 
 In addition to Adair County in Kentucky , Adair County , Missouri , Adair County , Iowa , and the towns of <unk> , Kentucky , and Adair , Iowa , were named in his honor . 
 = Palazzo Pitti = 
 The Palazzo Pitti ( Italian pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ) , in English sometimes called the Pitti Palace , is a vast , mainly Renaissance , palace in Florence , Italy . It is situated on the south side of the River Arno , a short distance from the Ponte Vecchio . The core of the present palazzo dates from 1458 and was originally the town residence of Luca Pitti , an ambitious Florentine banker . 
 The palace was bought by the Medici family in 1549 and became the chief residence of the ruling families of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany . It grew as a great treasure house as later generations amassed paintings , plates , jewelry and luxurious possessions . 
 In the late 18th century , the palazzo was used as a power base by Napoleon , and later served for a brief period as the principal royal palace of the newly united Italy . The palace and its contents were donated to the Italian people by King Victor Emmanuel III in 1919 . 
 The palazzo is now the largest museum complex in Florence . The principal palazzo block , often in a building of this design known as the corps de logis , is 32 @,@ 000 square metres . It is divided into several principal galleries or museums detailed below . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 The construction of this severe and forbidding building was commissioned in 1458 by the Florentine banker Luca Pitti , a principal supporter and friend of Cosimo de ' Medici . The early history of the Palazzo Pitti is a mixture of fact and myth . Pitti is alleged to have instructed that the windows be larger than the entrance of the Palazzo Medici . The 16th @-@ century art historian Giorgio Vasari proposed that Brunelleschi was the palazzo 's architect , and that his pupil Luca <unk> was merely his assistant in the task but today it is <unk> that is generally credited . Besides obvious differences from the elder architect 's style , Brunelleschi died 12 years before construction of the palazzo began . The design and fenestration suggest that the unknown architect was more experienced in utilitarian domestic architecture than in the humanist rules defined by Alberti in his book De Re <unk> . 
 Though impressive , the original palazzo would have been no rival to the Florentine Medici residences in terms of either size or content . Whoever the architect of the Palazzo Pitti was , he was moving against the contemporary flow of fashion . The rusticated stonework gives the palazzo a severe and powerful atmosphere , reinforced by the three @-@ times @-@ repeated series of seven arch @-@ headed apertures , reminiscent of a Roman aqueduct . The Roman @-@ style architecture appealed to the Florentine love of the new style all <unk> . This original design has withstood the test of time : the repetitive formula of the façade was continued during the subsequent additions to the palazzo , and its influence can be seen in numerous 16th @-@ century imitations and 19th @-@ century revivals . Work stopped after Pitti suffered financial losses following the death of Cosimo de ' Medici in 1464 . Luca Pitti died in 1472 with the building unfinished . 
 = = = The Medici = = = 
 The building was sold in 1549 by Buonaccorso Pitti , a descendant of Luca Pitti , to Eleonora di Toledo . Raised at the luxurious court of Naples , Eleonora was the wife of Cosimo I de ' Medici of Tuscany , later the Grand Duke . On moving into the palace , Cosimo had Vasari enlarge the structure to fit his tastes ; the palace was more than doubled by the addition of a new block along the rear . Vasari also built the Vasari Corridor , an above @-@ ground walkway from Cosimo 's old palace and the seat of government , the Palazzo Vecchio , through the Uffizi , above the Ponte Vecchio to the Palazzo Pitti . This enabled the Grand Duke and his family to move easily and safely from their official residence to the Palazzo Pitti . Initially the Palazzo Pitti was used mostly for lodging official guests and for occasional functions of the court , while the Medicis ' principal residence remained the Palazzo Vecchio . It was not until the reign of Eleonora 's son Ferdinando I and his wife Johanna of Austria that the palazzo was occupied on a permanent basis and became home to the Medicis ' art collection . 
 Land on the Boboli hill at the rear of the palazzo was acquired in order to create a large formal park and gardens , today known as the Boboli Gardens . The landscape architect employed for this was the Medici court artist Niccolò <unk> , who died the following year ; he was quickly succeeded by Bartolommeo Ammanati . The original design of the gardens centred on an amphitheatre , behind the corps de logis of the palazzo . The first play recorded as performed there was Andria by Terence in 1476 . It was followed by many classically inspired plays of Florentine playwrights such as Giovan Battista Cini . Performed for the amusement of the cultivated Medici court , they featured elaborate sets designed by the court architect <unk> <unk> . 
 = = The <unk> and extensions = = 
 With the garden project well in hand , Ammanati turned his attentions to creating a large courtyard immediately behind the principal façade , to link the palazzo to its new garden . This courtyard has heavy @-@ banded channelled rustication that has been widely copied , notably for the Parisian palais of Maria de ' Medici , the Luxembourg . In the principal façade Ammanati also created the <unk> <unk> ( " kneeling " windows , in reference to their imagined resemblance to a prie @-@ dieu , a device of Michelangelo 's ) , replacing the entrance bays at each end . During the years 1558 – 70 , Ammanati created a monumental staircase to lead with more pomp to the piano nobile , and he extended the wings on the garden front that embraced a courtyard excavated into the steeply sloping hillside at the same level as the piazza in front , from which it was visible through the central arch of the basement . On the garden side of the courtyard <unk> constructed a grotto , called the " grotto of Moses " on account of the porphyry statue that inhabits it . On the terrace above it , level with the piano nobile windows , Ammanati constructed a fountain centered on the axis ; it was later replaced by the Fontana del <unk> ( " Fountain of the Artichoke " ) , designed by Giambologna 's former assistant , Francesco <unk> , and completed in 1641 . 
 In 1616 , a competition was held to design extensions to the principal urban façade by three bays at either end . Giulio Parigi won the commission ; work on the north side began in 1618 , and on the south side in 1631 by Alfonso Parigi . During the 18th century , two perpendicular wings were constructed by the architect Giuseppe Ruggeri to enhance and stress the widening of via Romana , which creates a piazza centered on the façade , the prototype of the cour d 'honneur that was copied in France . Sporadic lesser additions and alterations were made for many years thereafter under other rulers and architects . 
 To one side of the Gardens is the bizarre grotto designed by Bernardo <unk> . The lower façade was begun by Vasari but the architecture of the upper storey is subverted by " dripping " pumice stalactites with the Medici coat of arms at the centre . The interior is similarly poised between architecture and nature ; the first chamber has copies of Michelangelo 's four unfinished slaves emerging from the corners which seem to carry the vault with an open oculus at its centre and painted as a rustic bower with animals , figures and vegetation . Figures , animals and trees made of stucco and rough pumice adorn the lower walls . A short passage leads to a small second chamber and to a third which has a central fountain with Giambologna 's Venus in the centre of the basin , peering fearfully over her shoulder at the four satyrs spitting jets of water at her from the edge . 
 = = = Houses of Lorraine and Savoy = = = 
 The palazzo remained the principal Medici residence until the last male Medici heir died in 1737 . It was then occupied briefly by his sister , the elderly Electress Palatine ; on her death , the Medici dynasty became extinct and the palazzo passed to the new Grand Dukes of Tuscany , the Austrian House of Lorraine , in the person of Francis I , Holy Roman Emperor . The Austrian tenancy was briefly interrupted by Napoleon , who used the palazzo during his period of control over Italy . 
 When Tuscany passed from the House of Lorraine to the House of Savoy in 1860 , the Palazzo Pitti was included . After the Risorgimento , when Florence was briefly the capital of the Kingdom of Italy , Victor Emmanuel II resided in the palazzo until 1871 . His grandson , Victor Emmanuel III , presented the palazzo to the nation in 1919 . The palazzo and other buildings in the Boboli Gardens were then divided into five separate art galleries and a museum , housing not only many of its original contents , but priceless artefacts from many other collections acquired by the state . The 140 rooms open to the public are part of an interior , which is in large part a later product than the original portion of the structure , mostly created in two phases , one in the 17th century and the other in the early 18th century . Some earlier interiors remain , and there are still later additions such as the Throne Room . In 2005 the surprise discovery of forgotten 18th @-@ century bathrooms in the palazzo revealed remarkable examples of contemporary plumbing very similar in style to the bathrooms of the 21st century . 
 = = Palatine Gallery = = 
 See a partial list of work at Collections of Palazzo Pitti 
 The Palatine Gallery , the main gallery of Palazzo Pitti , contains a large ensemble of over 500 principally Renaissance paintings , which were once part of the Medicis ' and their successors ' private art collection . The gallery , which overflows into the royal apartments , contains works by Raphael , Titian , Perugino ( Lamentation over the Dead Christ ) , Correggio , Peter Paul Rubens , and Pietro da Cortona . The character of the gallery is still that of a private collection , and the works of art are displayed and hung much as they would have been in the grand rooms for which they were intended rather than following a chronological sequence , or arranged according to school of art . 
 The finest rooms were decorated by Pietro da Cortona in the high baroque style . Initially Cortona frescoed a small room on the piano nobile called the Sala della <unk> with a series depicting the Four Ages of Man which were very well received ; the Age of Gold and Age of Silver were painted in 1637 , followed in 1641 by the Age of Bronze and Age of Iron . They are regarded among his masterpieces . The artist was subsequently asked to fresco the grand ducal reception rooms ; a suite of five rooms at the front of the palazzo . In these five Planetary Rooms , the hierarchical sequence of the deities is based on <unk> cosmology ; Venus , Apollo , Mars , Jupiter ( the Medici Throne room ) and Saturn , but minus Mercury and the Moon which should have come before Venus . These highly ornate ceilings with frescoes and elaborate stucco work essentially celebrate the Medici lineage and the bestowal of virtuous leadership . Cortona left Florence in 1647 , and his pupil and collaborator , Ciro Ferri , completed the cycle by the 1660s . They were to inspire the later Planet Rooms at Louis XIV 's Versailles , designed by Le Brun . 
 The collection was first opened to the public in the late 18th century , albeit rather reluctantly , by Grand Duke Leopold , Tuscany 's first enlightened ruler , keen to obtain popularity after the demise of the Medici . 
 = = = Rooms of Palatine Gallery = = = 
 The Palatine Gallery has 28 rooms , among them : 
 Room of Castagnoli : named after the painter of the ceiling frescoes . In this room are exposed Portraits of the Medici and Lorraine ruling families , and the Table of the Muses , a masterwork of stone @-@ inlaid table realized by the <unk> delle <unk> <unk> between 1837 and 1851 . 
 Room of the Ark : contains a painting by Giovan Battista Caracciolo ( 17th century ) . In 1816 , the ceiling was frescoed by Luigi <unk> with Noah entering Jerusalem with the Ark . 
 Room of Psyche : was named after ceiling frescoes by Giuseppe Collignon ; it contains paintings by Salvator Rosa from 1640 – 1650 . 
 Hall of <unk> : The frescoes on the vault were once ascribed to Bernardino <unk> , but now attributed to Matteo Rosselli . In the center of the hall is a table ( 1716 ) commissioned by Cosimo III . In the hall are also some works by Rubens and Pontormo . 
 Room of Prometheus : was named after the subject of the frescoes by Giuseppe Collignon ( 19th century ) and contains a large collection of round @-@ shaped paintings : among them is the Madonna with the Child by Filippino Lippi ( 15th century ) , two portraits by Botticelli and paintings by Pontormo and Domenico <unk> .

 This is a suite of 14 rooms , formerly used by the Medici family , and lived in by their successors . These rooms have been largely altered since the era of the Medici , most recently in the 19th century . They contain a collection of Medici portraits , many of them by the artist Giusto <unk> . In contrast to the great salons containing the Palatine collection , some of these rooms are much smaller and more intimate , and , while still grand and gilded , are more suited to day @-@ to @-@ day living requirements . Period furnishings include four @-@ poster beds and other necessary furnishings not found elsewhere in the palazzo . The Kings of Italy last used the Palazzo Pitti in the 1920s . By that time it had already been converted to a museum , but a suite of rooms ( now the Gallery of Modern Art ) was reserved for them when visiting Florence officially . 
 = = = Gallery of Modern Art = = = 
 This gallery originates from the remodeling of the Florentine academy in 1748 , when a gallery of Modern Art was established . The gallery was intended to hold those art works which were prize @-@ winners in the academy 's competitions . The Palazzo Pitti was being redecorated on a grand scale at this time and the new works of art were being collected to adorn the newly decorated salons . By the mid @-@ 19th century so numerous were the Grand Ducal paintings of modern art that many were transferred to the Palazzo della <unk> , which became the first home of the newly formed " Modern Art Museum " . 
 Following the Risorgimento and the expulsion of the Grand Ducal family from the palazzo , all the Grand Ducal modern art works were brought together under one roof in the newly titled " Modern gallery of the Academy " . The collection continued to expand , particularly so under the patronage of Vittorio Emanuele II . However it was not until 1922 that this gallery was moved to the Palazzo Pitti where it was complemented by further modern works of art in the ownership of both the state and the municipality of Florence . The collection was housed in apartments recently vacated by members of the Italian Royal family . The gallery was first opened to public viewing in 1928 . 
 Today , further enlarged and spread over 30 rooms , this large collection includes works by artists of the <unk> movement and other modern Italian schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries . The pictures by the <unk> artists are of particular note , as this school of 19th @-@ century Tuscan painters led by Giovanni <unk> were early pioneers and the founders of the impressionist movement . The title " gallery of modern art " to some may sound incorrect , as the art in the gallery covers the period from the 18th to the early 20th century . No examples of later art are included in the collection since In Italy , " modern art " refers to the period before World War II ; what has followed is generally known as " contemporary art " ( arte <unk> ) . In Tuscany this art can be found at the Centro per l 'arte <unk> Luigi Pecci at Prato , a city about 15 km ( 9 mi ) from Florence . 
 = = = Silver Museum = = = 
 The Silver Museum , sometimes called " The Medici Treasury " , contains a collection of priceless silver , cameos , and works in semi @-@ precious gemstones , many of the latter from the collection of Lorenzo de ' Medici , including his collection of ancient vases , many with delicate silver gilt mounts added for display purposes in the 15th century . These rooms , formerly part of the private royal apartments , are decorated with 17th @-@ century frescoes , the most splendid being by Giovanni da San Giovanni , from 1635 to 1636 . The Silver Museum also contains a fine collection of German gold and silver artefacts purchased by Grand Duke Ferdinand after his return from exile in 1815 , following the French occupation .

 First opened in 1973 , this museum is housed in the Casino del Cavaliere in the Boboli Gardens . The porcelain is from many of the most notable European porcelain factories , with Sèvres and Meissen near Dresden being well represented . Many items in the collection were gifts to the Florentine rulers from other European sovereigns , while other works were specially commissioned by the Grand Ducal court . Of particular note are several large dinner services by the Vincennes factory , later renamed Sèvres , and a collection of small biscuit figurines . 
 = = = Costume Gallery = = = 
 Situated in a wing known as the " <unk> della Meridiana " , this gallery contains a collection of theatrical costumes dating from the 16th century until the present . It is also the only museum in Italy detailing the history of Italian fashions . One of the newer collections to the palazzo , it was founded in 1983 by Kirsten <unk> <unk> ; a suite of fourteen rooms , the Meridiana apartments , were completed in 1858 . 
 In addition to theatrical costumes , the gallery displays garments worn between the 18th century and the present day . Some of the exhibits are unique to the Palazzo Pitti ; these include the 16th @-@ century funeral clothes of Grand Duke Cosimo I de ' Medici , and Eleonora of Toledo and her son <unk> , both of whom died of malaria . Their bodies would have been displayed in state wearing their finest clothes , before being reclad in plainer attire before interment . The gallery also exhibits a collection of mid @-@ 20th century costume jewellery . The Sala Meridiana originally sponsored a functional solar meridian instrument , built into the fresco decoration by Anton Domenico Gabbiani . 
 = = = Carriages Museum = = = 
 This ground floor museum exhibits carriages and other conveyances used by the Grand Ducal court mainly in the late 18th and 19th century . The extent of the exhibition prompted one visitor in the 19th century to wonder , " In the name of all that is extraordinary , how can they find room for all these carriages and horses " . Some of the carriages are highly decorative , being adorned not only by gilt but by painted landscapes on their panels . Those used on the grandest occasions , such as the " <unk> d 'Oro " ( golden carriage ) , are surmounted by gilt crowns which would have indicated the rank and station of the carriage 's occupants . Other carriages on view are those used by the King of the Two Sicilies , and Archbishops and other Florentine dignitaries . 
 = = The Palazzo today = = 
 Today , transformed from royal palace to museum , the Palazzo is in the hands of the Italian state through the " Polo <unk> Fiorentino " , an institution which administers twenty museums , including the Uffizi Gallery , and has ultimate responsibility for 250 @,@ 000 catalogued works of art . In spite of its metamorphosis from royal residence to a state @-@ owned public building , the palazzo , sitting on its elevated site overlooking Florence , still retains the air and atmosphere of a private collection in a grand house . This is to a great extent due to the " Amici di Palazzo Pitti " ( Friends of the Palazzo Pitti ) , an organisation of volunteers and patrons founded in 1996 , which raises funds and makes suggestions for the ongoing maintenance of the palazzo and the collections , and for the continuing improvement of their visual display . 
 = Æthelhere of East Anglia = 
 Æthelhere ( died 15 November 655 ) was King of East Anglia from 653 or 654 until his death . He was a member of the ruling Wuffingas dynasty and one of three sons of Eni to rule East Anglia as Christian kings . He was a nephew of Rædwald , who was the first of the Wuffingas of which more than a name is known . 
 Rædwald and his son Eorpwald both ruled as pagans before being converted to Christianity . After Eorpwald 's murder in around 627 , the East Angles briefly reverted to heathenism , before Christianity was re @-@ established by Sigeberht . Sigeberht eventually abdicated in favour of his co @-@ ruler Ecgric , after which the East Angles were defeated in battle by the Mercians , led by their king Penda , during which both Ecgric and Sigeberht were slain . The monks at Cnobheresburg were driven out by Penda in 651 and Ecgric 's successor Anna was forced into temporarily exile . In 653 Penda once again attacked East Anglia and at the Battle of Bulcamp , Anna and his son were slain and the East Anglian army was defeated . Æthelhere then became king of the East Angles , possibly ruling jointly with his surviving brother , Æthelwold . During Æthelhere 's brief reign , it is known that Botolph 's monastery at Iken was built . 
 In 655 , Æthelhere was one of thirty noble warlords who joined with Penda in an invasion of Northumbria , laying siege to Oswiu and the much smaller Northumbrian army . The battle was fought on 15 November 655 , near the Winwæd , an unidentified river . The Northumbrians were victorious and many of the Mercians and their allies were killed or drowned . In the battle , Penda and nearly all his warlords , including Æthelhere , were killed . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the end of Roman rule in Britain , the region now known as East Anglia was settled by a North Germanic group known as the Angles , although there is evidence of early settlement of the region by a minority of other peoples , for instance the Swabians , who settled in the area around the modern town of Swaffham . By 600 , a number of kingdoms had begun to form in the territories of southern Britain conquered by the Angles , Saxons , Jutes and Frisians . The ruling dynasty of East Anglia was the Wuffingas , named from Wuffa , an early king . The first king known to have ruled is Rædwald , whose reign spanned a quarter of a century from about 599 . 
 Æthelhere was probably the second of the sons of Eni , the brother of Rædwald . Four sons are certainly known : Æthilric , the father of Ealdwulf , Anna , Æthelhere and Æthelwold , his successor . The brothers all appear to have been firmly committed to Christian rule : Æthilric married the Christian Hereswith , the great @-@ niece of Edwin of Northumbria . Anna is described by Bede as almost a saintly figure and the father of a most religious family , who brought about the conversion of Cenwalh of Wessex , and Æthelwold was the sponsor of Swithelm of Essex during his baptism . 
 Æthelhere witnessed the fortunes of his dynasty during the years of Rædwald 's rule and afterwards . The East Angles under Rædwald had been converted to Christianity , but in around 627 , during the reign of his son Eorpwald , they reverted to heathenism . This occurred after Eorpwald was killed by a pagan soon after his succession and baptism . The assassin , Ricberht , may then have ruled the kingdom for a few years , to be succeeded by Sigeberht , who re @-@ established Christianity in the kingdom and became the first East Anglian king to act as a patron of the Church . 
 = = Mercian destabilisation of the East Angles = = 
 Sigeberht abdicated in favour of his co @-@ ruler Ecgric and retired to lead a monastic life , but soon afterwards the East Angles were attacked by Mercian forces , led by their king , Penda . Ecgric and his army appealed to Sigeberht to lead them into battle against the Mercians , but he refused to participate . He was dragged from his monastery to the battlefield , where , still refusing to bear arms or fight , he and Ecgric were slain and the defeated East Anglian army was destroyed . 
 Ecgric 's successor , Anna , acted as a challenge to the increasing power of Penda throughout his reign . In 645 , after Cenwalh of Wessex had renounced his wife , who was Penda 's sister , Penda drove him from his kingdom and into exile . Anna was strong enough to offer protection to Cenwalh when he sought refuge at the East Anglian court : whilst there he was converted to Christianity , returning in 648 to rule Wessex as a Christian king . Anna probably provided military support for Cenwalh 's return to his throne . 
 During the late 640s , the Irish monk Fursey , having spent a year as a hermit , left East Anglia for Gaul . His monastery at Cnobheresburg ( identified by some with Burgh Castle ) was left in the hands of his half @-@ brother , Foillan . In 651 , shortly after his departure , the heathen threat he had foreseen became a reality , when Foillan and his community were driven out by Penda 's forces and Anna , who encountered Penda at Cnobheresburg , was exiled . 
 = = Reign = = 
 In 653 or early 654 , after Anna had returned from exile , Penda was able to direct a military assault upon the East Angles . The Mercian and East Anglian armies fought at Bulcamp ( near Blythburgh in Suffolk ) , where Anna and his son were slain and the East Anglian army was slaughtered in large numbers . Æthelhere then succeeded his brother as Penda 's client @-@ king , although Barbara Yorke has suggested that Æthelhere and his surviving brother Æthelwold may have reigned jointly , as Bede separately refers to both men as Anna 's successor . 
 Æthelhere 's short reign , during which <unk> remained bishop of the see of Dommoc , witnessed the construction of Botolph 's monastery at Iken . The site lay within the sphere of Rendlesham and Sutton Hoo . Æthelhere would have arranged his brother 's funeral , whose reputed burial @-@ site was at Blythburgh . 
 = = Battle of the Winwæd = = 
 During 655 , Æthelhere joined with Penda in an assault on Northumbria . Steven Plunkett asserts that Æthelhere 's motive for changing sides was to deflect Penda 's attention from East Anglia and the destruction of his kingdom that would have ensued . Penda invaded Northumbria with a force of thirty duces <unk> ( or royal commanders ) under his command that included a large contingent of Britons . He laid siege to Oswiu at Maes Gai , in the district of <unk> , which was probably at that time within the sphere of influence of the British kingdom of Rheged . Oswiu offered him a great ransom of treasure which , according to Bede , was refused ( or according to the Historia Brittonum , was accepted and distributed ) — in either case Penda resolved on battle and the destruction of the Northumbrians . Oswiu had a much smaller force , but in the event the Welsh armies of King <unk> of Gwynedd decamped on the eve of battle and Penda 's ally <unk> of Deira stood aside to await the outcome . 
 The " major setpiece battle " , according to Barbara Yorke , was fought on 15 November 655 , on the banks of the River Winwæd , the location of which has not been identified . The waters of the Winwæd were in spate owing to heavy rains and had flooded the land . The Northumbrians were victorious , the Mercian forces were slaughtered and many of them drowned in flight . Penda himself was killed , together with nearly all his allies , including Æthelhere of East Anglia , who was leading the East Anglian part of the forces ranged against Oswiu : 
 Among whom was Ethelhere , brother and successor to Anna , king of the East Angles . He had been the occasion of the war , and was now killed , having lost his army and auxiliaries . 
 Although the passage from Bede suggests that Æthelhere was the cause of the war — auctor ipse belli — it has been argued that an issue of punctuation in later manuscripts confused Bede 's meaning on this point , and that he in fact meant to refer to Penda as being responsible for the war . According to the 12th century Historia Anglorum , the deaths of five Anglo @-@ Saxon kings were avenged : 
 = 1994 European Super Cup = 
 The 1994 European Super Cup was a football match played over two legs between Arsenal of England and Milan of Italy . It was the 20th staging of the European Super Cup , a fixture between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and European Cup Winners ' Cup . The first leg was played at Highbury , London on 1 February 1995 and at the San Siro , Milan a week later for the second leg . Milan won the Super Cup 2 – 0 on aggregate . 
 The teams qualified for the competition by separately winning the 1993 – 94 UEFA Champions League and 1993 – 94 European Cup Winners ' Cup . Milan won the former , beating Barcelona 4 – 0 in the final . Arsenal qualified as winners of the Cup Winners ' Cup ; in the final of the competition they defeated Parma by a single goal . This was the first official meeting between both clubs in European football . 
 Milan 's preparations for the Super Cup were blighted by the death of Vincenzo Spagnolo , a Genoa supporter who was stabbed on his way to watch the two teams play . Once news of his death had arrived , the match was abandoned and the Italian football calendar was suspended for a week . Milan and Arsenal paid respect to Spagnolo by observing a minute 's silence before the first leg . A crowd of 38 @,@ 044 witnessed both clubs play out a goalless draw at Highbury ; the first leg marked the return of Paul Merson , who spent time away from football in order to seek treatment for various addictions . A significantly lower crowd at the San Siro saw Milan dominate in large periods and win courtesy of goals from <unk> Boban and Daniele Massaro . 
 = = Background = = 
 The European Super Cup was founded in the early 1970s , as a means to determine the best team in Europe and serve as a challenge to Ajax , the strongest club side of its day . The proposal by Dutch journalist Anton Witkamp , a football match between the holders of the European Cup and Cup Winners ' Cup , failed to receive UEFA 's backing , given the recent Cup Winners ' Cup winners Rangers had been banned from European competition . Witkamp nonetheless proceeded with his vision , a two @-@ legged match played between Ajax and Rangers in January 1973 . The competition was endorsed and recognised by UEFA a year later . 
 Arsenal qualified for the Super Cup as the reigning European Cup Winners ' Cup winners . It marked their debut in the event . Arsenal had conceded only three goals throughout the 1993 – 94 staging of the Cup Winners ' Cup , and beat Italian side Parma by a single goal to win the final . The other Super Cup place went to Milan , winners of the 1993 – 94 UEFA Champions League . Milan defeated pre @-@ match favourites Barcelona 4 – 0 in the final , a result which earnt the club their third top European honour in six years . Milan were appearing in the event for the fifth time ; prior to the game against Arsenal , they had won the Super Cup in consecutive years ( in 1989 and 1990 ) , and were on the losing side twice ( in 1973 and 1993 ) . This was first meeting between the two sides in competitive European football . 
 Neither match was televised live in the United Kingdom , though highlights were shown on Carlton ( the London @-@ based ITV company ) , Channel 4 's Football Italia and Sky Sports . Live radio commentary of the second leg was broadcast during Trevor Brooking 's Football Night on BBC Radio 5 Live . 
 = = First leg = = 
 The first leg was held at Highbury on 1 February 1995 . Milan 's preparations were overshadowed by the violence that occurred in their last domestic fixture , against Genoa three days ago . Clashes between both sets of supporters resulted in police intervention and the use of tear gas . Vincenzo Spagnolo , a Genoa supporter , was stabbed prior to kick @-@ off and subsequently died while receiving treatment . The match was later abandoned once word was sent to the players and staff during half @-@ time . Milan manager Fabio Capello admitted his players were deeply affected by the incident and struggled to focus on the Super Cup match . He told reporters : " I believe that the psychological balance of each player has been damaged by Sunday 's tragedy . Our team was in great condition until Sunday . But in the past few days I have had to wake up the players . So I 'm not able to anticipate which kind of Milan you will see . " 800 Milan supporters travelled to London , and Capello denied reports a section of them intended to cause trouble . 
 Paul Merson returned to the Arsenal squad , after his much @-@ publicised cocaine , alcohol and drug addiction . The England international , who was admitted to a rehabilitation clinic for treatment during his absence , started on the substitutes ' bench . Arsenal lined up in a 4 – 4 – 2 formation , with Ian Wright paired alongside John Hartson upfront and Kevin Campbell shifted on the right of midfield . Milan lined up in a similar formation , with Marcel Desailly and Demetrio Albertini anchoring the midfield . 
 A minute 's silence was observed before kick @-@ off in memory of Spagnolo ; as is tradition in Italian football , the Milanese supporters clapped throughout to pay their respect . The game itself was lacklustre and was described as a " training match , " lacking in " fervour and commitment " by The Times football correspondent Rob Hughes . There were few clear @-@ cut chances created by both teams , and neither managed to score over the 90 minutes . Both however looked assured defending ; Milan triggered the offside trap on several occasions , while Arsenal were boosted by club captain Tony Adams playing his first full match in two months . Manager George Graham assessed afterwards : " It was back to the Arsenal of old . We were very solid . " Glenn Moore , of The Independent felt Milan would have won had they finished better , noting Dejan Savićević 's tame volley in the 75th minute . Marco Simone twice hit the ball wide , while a free @-@ kick from Albertini forced Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman to action . The home side 's best chance came from Wright in the 36th minute . He picked up the ball from Arsenal 's half and proceeded to run , evading the challenges of several Milan players . His shot at goal was smartly saved by Sebastiano Rossi . Further chances went to Hartson , who headed from a Stefan Schwarz 's corner , and Steve Bould , before Campbell broke forward and had his effort blocked by the Milan goalkeeper . 
 Merson 's introduction in the 74th minute was cheered by the Arsenal supporters , as was his every touch of the ball . He admitted he was overwhelmed by the occasion , adding post @-@ match : " It was a great feeling to be in action again and I thank all those who 've made it easier for me . This is the first step back . "

 = = Second leg = = 
 The second leg was held at the San Siro on 8 February 1995 . It marked the resumption of football in Italy , as play was abandoned for a week in memory of Spagnolo . The incident at the San Siro prompted Milan to use security measures usually reserved for high @-@ profile matches . Ugo <unk> , the club spokesman however downplayed reports security was heightened : " There won 't be any special security measures for them . They will all be housed in a special sector of the stadium , segregated from the Milan fans . What we 're most concerned about is how our fans behave . " 15 @,@ 800 tickets were sold the night before the match , 13 @,@ 600 of which were purchased by Milan supporters . <unk> admitted this was a repercussion of the violence in their last home game ; " People are scared to come to football at the moment . " 
 Milan entered the match the fresher of the two teams , but Simon Barnes commented in his Times match preview that Arsenal 's biggest asset was their " sheer bloody mindedness . " The club 's indiscipline was a major talking point before the game , as two players were sent off in defeat to Sheffield Wednesday the previous Saturday . Graham 's future was also called in question , after claims that he received illegal payments from transfer deals ( bungs ) , which he dismissed . In his pre @-@ match news conference , the Arsenal manager spoke highly of European football and was eager to win another trophy for the club : " We are having a bad season by our standards and any win in any cup is worth something . " 
 Merson came in place of John Jensen in Arsenal 's starting XI , while for Milan Zvonimir Boban replaced the suspended Simone , and Christian <unk> was chosen to stand in for Paolo Maldini . Graham deployed a 4 – 1 – 4 – 1 formation , with Schwarz acting as the lone defensive midfielder and Hartson positioned the furthest forward . Watched by a crowd of 23 @,@ 953 , Milan eased to a 2 – 0 win and in the process ended Arsenal 's 15 @-@ match unbeaten run in Europe . The home side 's first goal came minutes before half @-@ time , when Daniele Massaro 's defensive @-@ splitting pass found Boban , who scored , despite Schwarz 's attempts to hold him back by tugging his shirt . The Croatian forward nearly scored a second , but for Seaman 's quick intervention . Up until then , Arsenal had briefly threatened ; from a long ball in the 19th minute , Hartson managed to turn Franco <unk> , but scuffed his shot wide . Milan found it easy to contain the opposition , given Desailly and Savićević influenced the tempo of the match . The latter came close to doubling Milan 's lead when he broke forward and hit a shot goalwards , only for Seaman to divert the ball round the post . In the second half , Wright thought he had equalised for Arsenal when he tapped the ball in , but the referee disallowed the goal as there was infringement in the build @-@ up . Milan continued to attack and extended their lead soon after ; from Savićević 's corner , Massaro jumped higher than his marker Lee Dixon and headed the ball into the Arsenal goal . Dixon , who required treatment early in the second half , was substituted for Martin Keown right away as he struggled to play on . 
 The home side 's performance was lauded by journalist Russell Thomas , who opened his match report in The Guardian with the line " Milan produced football of ease and elegance way beyond the English capabilities . " By contrast , Moore noted Arsenal had " looked a different side from the sterile and nervous one seen in domestic matches . " Graham described Milan as " ... the best team in Europe , or in the world . We 've learnt a lot . But we could have given them a better game , though , and I am disappointed . " Capello was content with Milan 's win , and believed his team were " still about two months where we should be . " It was his eighth trophy as manager of the club , one better than his predecessor Arrigo Sacchi . He said of the achievement : " The mentality of this great club is passed on from the older players to the younger players , so they learn self @-@ sacrifice and how to fight for every trophy they go for . " 
 Arsenal and Milan went on to reach the 1995 finals of the UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup and UEFA Champions League respectively , though failed to retain their titles . Arsenal lost in extra time to Real Zaragoza , while Ajax beat Milan by a single goal .

 = John Dudley , 1st Duke of Northumberland = 
 John Dudley , 1st Duke of Northumberland KG ( 1504 – 22 August 1553 ) was an English general , admiral , and politician , who led the government of the young King Edward VI from 1550 until 1553 , and unsuccessfully tried to install Lady Jane Grey on the English throne after the King 's death . The son of Edmund Dudley , a minister of Henry VII executed by Henry VIII , John Dudley became the ward of Sir Edward Guildford at the age of seven . He grew up in Guildford 's household together with his future wife , Guildford 's daughter Jane , with whom he was to have 13 children . Dudley served as Vice @-@ Admiral and Lord Admiral from 1537 until 1547 , during which time he set novel standards of navy organisation and was an innovative commander at sea . He also developed a strong interest in overseas exploration . Dudley took part in the 1544 campaigns in Scotland and France and was one of Henry VIII 's intimates in the last years of the reign . He was also a leader of the religious reform party at court . 
 In 1547 Dudley was created Earl of Warwick and , with the Duke of Somerset , England 's Lord Protector , distinguished himself in the renewed Scottish war at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh . During the country @-@ wide uprisings of 1549 Dudley put down Kett 's Rebellion in Norfolk . Convinced of the Protector 's incompetence , he and other privy councillors forced Somerset out of office in October 1549 . Having averted a conservative reaction in religion and a plot to destroy him alongside Somerset , Dudley emerged in early 1550 as de facto regent for the 12 @-@ year @-@ old Edward VI . He reconciled himself with Somerset , who nevertheless soon began to intrigue against him and his policies . Somerset was executed on largely fabricated charges , three months after Dudley had been raised to the Dukedom of Northumberland in October 1551 . 
 As Lord President of the Council , Dudley headed a distinctly conciliar government and sought to introduce the adolescent King into business . Taking over an almost bankrupt administration , he ended the costly wars with France and Scotland and tackled finances in ways that led to some economic recovery . To prevent further uprisings he introduced countrywide policing on a local basis , appointing Lords Lieutenants who were in close contact with the central authority . Dudley 's religious policy was — in accordance with Edward 's proclivities — decidedly Protestant , further enforcing the English Reformation and promoting radical reformers to high Church positions . 
 The 15 @-@ year @-@ old King fell ill in early 1553 and excluded his half @-@ sisters Mary and Elizabeth , whom he regarded as illegitimate , from the succession , designating non @-@ existent , hypothetical male heirs . As his death approached , Edward changed his will so that his Protestant cousin Jane Grey , Northumberland 's daughter @-@ in @-@ law , could inherit the Crown . To what extent the Duke influenced this scheme is uncertain . The traditional view is that it was Northumberland 's plot to maintain his power by placing his family on the throne . Many historians see the project as genuinely Edward 's , enforced by Dudley after the King 's death . The Duke did not prepare well for this occasion . Having marched to East Anglia to capture Princess Mary , he surrendered on hearing that the Privy Council had changed sides and proclaimed Mary as Queen . Convicted of high treason , Northumberland returned to Catholicism and abjured the Protestant faith before his execution . Having secured the contempt of both religious camps , popularly hated , and a natural scapegoat , he became the " wicked Duke " — in contrast to his predecessor Somerset , the " good Duke " . Only since the 1970s has he also been seen as a Tudor Crown servant : self @-@ serving , inherently loyal to the incumbent monarch , and an able statesman in difficult times . 
 = = Career under Henry VIII = = 
 John Dudley was the eldest of three sons of Edmund Dudley , a councillor of King Henry VII , and his second wife Elizabeth Grey , daughter of Edward Grey , 4th Viscount Lisle . His father was attainted and executed for high treason in 1510 , having been arrested immediately after Henry VIII 's accession because the new King needed scapegoats for his predecessor 's unpopular financial policies . In 1512 the seven @-@ year @-@ old John became the ward of Sir Edward Guildford and was taken into his household . At the same time Edmund Dudley 's attainder was lifted and John Dudley was restored " in name and blood " . The King was hoping for the good services " which the said John Dudley is likely to do " . At about age 15 John Dudley probably went with his guardian to the Pale of Calais to serve there for the next years . He took part in Cardinal Wolsey 's diplomatic voyages of 1521 and 1527 , and was knighted by Charles Brandon , 1st Duke of Suffolk during his first major military experience , the 1523 invasion of France . In 1524 Dudley became a Knight of the Body , and from 1534 he was responsible for the King 's body armour as Master of the Tower Armoury . Being " the most skilful of his generation , both on foot and on horseback " , he excelled in wrestling , archery , and the tournaments of the royal court , as a French report stated as late as 1546 . 
 In 1525 Dudley married Guildford 's daughter Jane , who was four years his junior and his former class @-@ mate . The Dudleys belonged to the new evangelical circles of the early 1530s , and their 13 children were educated in Renaissance humanism and science . Sir Edward Guildford died in 1534 without a written will . His only son having predeceased him , Guildford 's nephew , John Guildford , asserted that his uncle had intended him to inherit . Dudley and his wife contested this claim . The parties went to court and Dudley , who had secured Thomas Cromwell 's patronage , won the case . In 1532 he lent his cousin , John Sutton , 3rd Baron Dudley , over ₤ 7 @,@ 000 on the security of the baronial estate . Lord Dudley was unable to pay off any of his creditors , so when the mortgage was foreclosed in the late 1530s Sir John Dudley came into possession of Dudley Castle . 
 Dudley was present at Henry VIII 's meeting with Francis I of France at Calais in 1532 . Another member of the entourage was Anne Boleyn , who was soon to be queen . Dudley took part in the christenings of Princess Elizabeth and Prince Edward and , in connection with the announcement of the Prince 's birth to the Emperor , travelled to Spain via France in October 1537 . He sat in the Reformation parliament for Kent , in place of his deceased father @-@ in @-@ law , in 1534 – 1536 , and led one of the contingents sent against the Pilgrimage of Grace in late 1536 . In January 1537 Dudley was made Vice @-@ Admiral and began to apply himself to naval matters . He was Master of the Horse to Anne of Cleves and Katherine Howard , and in 1542 returned to the House of Commons as MP for Staffordshire but was soon promoted to the House of Lords when he became Viscount Lisle after the death of his stepfather Arthur Plantagenet and " by the right of his mother " . Being now a peer , Dudley became Lord Admiral and a Knight of the Garter in 1543 ; he was also admitted to the Privy Council . In the aftermath of the Battle of Solway Moss in 1542 he served as Warden of the Scottish Marches , and in the 1544 campaign the English force under Edward Seymour , Earl of Hertford was supported by a fleet which Dudley commanded . Dudley joined the land force that destroyed Edinburgh , after he had blown the main gate apart with a culverin . In late 1544 he was appointed Governor of Boulogne , the siege of which had cost the life of his eldest son , Henry . His tasks were to rebuild the fortifications to King Henry 's design and to fend off French attacks by sea and land . 
 As Lord Admiral , Dudley was responsible for creating the Council for Marine Causes , which for the first time co @-@ ordinated the various tasks of maintaining the navy functioning and thus made English naval administration the most efficient in Europe . At sea , Dudley 's fighting orders were at the forefront of tactical thinking : Squadrons of ships , ordered by size and firepower , were to manoeuvre in formation , using co @-@ ordinated gunfire . These were all new developments in the English navy . In 1545 he directed the fleet 's operations before , during , and after the Battle of the Solent and entertained King Henry on the flagship Henri Grace a Dieu . A tragic loss was the sinking of the Mary Rose with 500 men aboard . In 1546 John Dudley went to France for peace negotiations . When he suspected the Admiral of France , Claude d 'Annebault , of manoeuvres which might have led to a renewal of hostilities , he suddenly put to sea in a show of English strength , before returning to the negotiating table . He then travelled to Fontainebleau , where the English delegates were entertained by the Dauphin Henri and King Francis . In the Peace of Camp , the French king acknowledged Henry VIII 's title as " Supreme Head of the Church of England and Ireland " , a success for both England and her Lord Admiral . 
 John Dudley , popularly fêted and highly regarded by King Henry as a general , became a royal intimate who played cards with the ailing monarch . Next to Edward Seymour , Prince Edward 's maternal uncle , Dudley was one of the leaders of the Reformed party at court , and both their wives were among the friends of Anne Askew , the Protestant martyr destroyed by Bishop Stephen Gardiner in July 1546 . Dudley and the Queen 's brother , William Parr , tried to convince Anne Askew to conform to the Catholic doctrines of the Henrician church , yet she replied " it was great shame for them to counsel contrary to their knowledge " . In September Dudley struck Gardiner in the face during a full meeting of the Council . This was a grave offence , and he was lucky to escape with a month 's leave from court in disgrace . In the last weeks of the reign Seymour and Dudley played their parts in Henry 's strike against the conservative House of Howard , thus clearing the path for a Protestant minority rule . They were seen as the likely leaders of the impending regency — " there are no other nobles of a fit age and ability for the task " , Eustache Chapuys , the former Imperial ambassador , commented from his retirement . 
 = = From Earl of Warwick to Duke of Northumberland = = 
 The 16 executors of Henry VIII 's will also embodied the Regency Council that had been appointed to rule collectively during Edward VI 's minority . The new Council agreed on making Edward Seymour , Earl of Hertford Lord Protector with full powers , which in effect were those of a prince . At the same time the Council awarded themselves a round of promotions based on Henry VIII 's wishes ; the Earl of Hertford became the Duke of Somerset and John Dudley was created Earl of Warwick . The new Earl had to pass on his post of Lord Admiral to Somerset 's brother , Thomas Seymour , but advanced to Lord Great Chamberlain . Perceived as the most important man next the Protector , he was on friendly terms with Somerset , who soon reopened the war with Scotland . Dudley accompanied him as second @-@ in @-@ command with a taste for personal combat . On one occasion he fought his way out of an ambush and , spear in hand , chased his Scottish counterpart for some 250 yards ( 230 m ) , nearly running him through . In the Battle of Pinkie Dudley led the vanguard , being " one of the key architects of the English victory " . 
 The Protector 's agrarian policy and proclamations were inspired by a group of intellectuals sometimes called " the commonwealth men " . These were highly critical of landlords and left many commoners with the impression that enclosures were unlawful . As one of England 's major landowners , Dudley soon feared that this would lead to serious trouble and discreetly tried to warn Somerset . By the summer of 1549 there was widespread unrest or even rebellion all over England . The Marquess of Northampton had been unable to restore order in and around Norwich , so John Dudley was sent to get hold of Kett 's Rebellion . Dudley offered Robert Kett a pardon on the condition that the peasant army disband at once . This was rejected and the next night Dudley stormed the rebel @-@ held city with a small mercenary contingent and drove the rebels out after fierce street fighting ; 49 prisoners he had immediately hanged . Two days later Kett , who had his main camp outside the city , confronted the royal army , resulting in a slaughter of over 2 @,@ 000 peasants . In the following weeks Dudley conducted courts @-@ martial which executed many rebels , perhaps up to 300 . For the enraged and humiliated local gentry this was still not enough punishment , so Dudley warned them : " Is there no place for pardon ? ... What shall we then do ? Shall we hold the plough ourselves , play the carters and labour the ground with our own hands ? " 
 The Lord Protector , in his proclamations , appealed to the common people . To his colleagues , whom he hardly consulted , he displayed a distinctly autocratic and " increasingly contemptuous " face . By autumn 1549 the same councillors who had made him Protector were convinced that he had failed to exercise proper authority and was unwilling to listen to good counsel . Dudley still had the troops from the Norfolk campaign at his disposal , and in October 1549 he joined the Earl of Southampton and the Earl of Arundel , prominent religious conservatives , to lead a coup of councillors to oust the Protector from office . They withdrew from court to London , meeting in Dudley 's residence . Starting with the Protector , each side issued proclamations accusing the other of treason and declared to act in defence of the King 's safety . Somerset tried in vain to raise a popular force and entrenched himself with the King at the fortress Windsor Castle . Military force near Edward 's presence was unthinkable and , apparently , Dudley and Archbishop Cranmer brokered an unofficial deal with Somerset , who surrendered . To keep appearances , the 12 @-@ year @-@ old King personally commanded his uncle 's arrest . For a moment there was hope of a conservative restoration in some quarters . However , Dudley and Cranmer secured the Reformed agenda by persuading Edward to appoint additional Reformed @-@ minded members to the Council and Privy Chamber . In December 1549 Southampton tried to regain predominance by charging Dudley with treason , alongside Somerset , for having been an original ally of the Protector . The scheme misfired when Dudley invited the Council to his house and baffled the plotters by exclaiming , with his hand at his sword and " a warlike visage " : " my lord , you seek his [ Somerset 's ] blood and he that <unk> his blood would have mine also " . 
 Dudley consolidated his power through institutional manoeuvres and by January 1550 was in effect the new regent . On 2 February 1550 he became Lord President of the Council , with the capacity to debar councillors from the body and appoint new ones . He excluded Southampton and other conservatives , but arranged Somerset 's release and his return to the Privy Council and Privy Chamber . In June 1550 Dudley 's heir John married Somerset 's daughter Anne as a mark of reconciliation . Yet Somerset soon attracted political sympathizers and hoped to re @-@ establish his power by removing Dudley from the scene , " contemplating " , as he later admitted , the Lord President 's arrest and execution . Relying on his popularity with the masses , he campaigned against and tried to obstruct Dudley 's policies . His behaviour increasingly threatened the cohesion vital within a minority regime . In that respect Warwick would take no chances , and he now also aspired to a dukedom . He needed to advertise his power and impress his followers ; like his predecessor , he had to represent the King 's honour . His elevation as Duke of Northumberland came on 11 October 1551 with the Duke of Somerset participating in the ceremony . Five days later Somerset was arrested , while rumours about supposed plots of his circulated . He was accused of having planned a " banquet massacre " , in which the Council were to be assaulted and Dudley killed . Somerset was acquitted of treason , but convicted of felony for raising a contingent of armed men without a licence . He was executed on 22 January 1552 . While technically lawful , these events contributed much to Northumberland 's growing unpopularity . Dudley himself , according to a French eyewitness , confessed before his own end that " nothing had pressed so <unk> upon his conscience as the fraudulent scheme against the Duke of Somerset " . 
 = = Ruling England = = 
 Instead of taking the title of Lord Protector , John Dudley set out to rule as primus inter pares , the working atmosphere being more conciliar and less autocratic than under Somerset . The new Lord President of the Council reshuffled some high offices , becoming Grand Master of the Household himself and giving Somerset 's former office of Lord Treasurer to William Paulet , 1st Marquess of Winchester . The office of Grand Master entailed supervising the Royal Household , which gave Dudley the means to control the Privy Chamber and thus the King 's surroundings . This was done via his " special friends " ( as he called them ) , Sir John Gates and Lord Thomas Darcy . Dudley also placed his son @-@ in @-@ law Sir Henry Sidney and his brother Sir Andrew Dudley near the King . William Cecil was still in the Duke of Somerset 's service when he gradually shifted his loyalty to John Dudley , who made him Secretary of State and thought him " a most faithful servant and by that term most witty [ wise ] councillor ... as was scarce like in this realm " . In this position Cecil was Dudley 's trusted right hand , who primed the Privy Council according to the Lord President 's wishes . At the same time Cecil had intimate contact with the King because Edward worked closely with the secretaries of state . 
 Dudley organised Edward 's political education so that he should take an interest in affairs and at least appear to influence decisions . He wanted the King to grow into his authority as smoothly as possible . Disruptive conflicts when Edward took over government could thus be minimised , while Dudley 's chances to continue as principal minister would be good . From the age of about 14 Edward 's signature on documents no longer needed the Council 's <unk> , and the King was regularly debriefed in meetings with a Council of his own choosing — the principal administrators and the Duke of Northumberland were among the chosen . Dudley had a warm if respectful relationship with the teenager , who " loved and feared " him according to Jehan de Scheyfye , the Imperial ambassador . At a dinner Edward discussed with the envoy at length until Northumberland discreetly indicated to the King that he had said enough . Yet the Duke did not necessarily have his way in all things . In 1552 – 1553 the King 's hand can be discerned behind decisions ( and omissions ) that directly contravened Dudley 's wishes . At court , complex networks of influence were at work and Edward listened to more than one voice . Regarding the question to what extent Edward played a role in his own government , Stephen Alford writes : 
 It is possible to endorse Edward 's developing grasp of the business of kingship and accept the still powerful political presence of John Dudley and his colleagues . The structures of ... the ... Council and the royal household began to adapt themselves to the implications of the king 's age ... the dynamics of power at the centre were capable of reshaping themselves because the men around the king accepted that , in the circumstances , they should .

 Dudley set out to restore administrative efficiency and maintain public order to prevent renewed rebellion as seen in 1549 . Equipped with a new law " for the punishment of unlawful assemblies " , he built a united front of landholders and Privy Council , the government intervening locally at any sign of unrest . He returned to the ancient practice of granting licences to retain liveried followers and installed Lord Lieutenants that represented the central government and were to keep ready small bands of cavalry . These measures proved effective and the country was calm for the rest of the reign . In fact , in the summer of 1552 — a year before the succession crisis — the cavalry bands were disbanded to save money . 
 John Dudley also strove to alleviate the social situation . The 1547 " Act for the Punishment of Vagabonds " , which had enacted that any unemployed man found loitering was to be branded and given to the " <unk> " as a slave , was abolished as too harsh in 1550 . In 1552 Northumberland pushed a novel Poor Law through parliament which provided for weekly parish @-@ based collections for the " relief of the poor " . Parishes were to register their needy inhabitants as well as the amounts people agreed to give for them , while unwilling contributors were to be " induced " by the parson and , if need be , by the bishop . The years 1549 – 1551 saw poor harvests and , accordingly , soaring food prices . Dudley tried to intervene against the malpractices of middlemen by official searches for hidden corn and by fixing maximum prices for grain , meat , and other victuals . However , the set prices were so <unk> that farmers stopped to sell their produce at the open market and the regulations had to be rescinded . The regime 's agrarian policy , while giving landlords much freedom to enclose common land , also distinguished between different forms of enclosure . Landlords guilty of illegal enclosures were increasingly prosecuted . 
 The financial legacy of the Protectorate consisted , apart from crippling Crown debts , of an unprecedentedly debased coinage . On the second day as Lord President of the Council , Dudley began a process to tackle the problems of the mint . He set up a committee that looked into the peculation by the officers of the mint and other institutions . In 1551 the government at the same time tried to yield profit and restore confidence in the coin by issuing yet further debased coinage and " crying it down " immediately afterwards . The result was panic and confusion and , to get hold of the situation , a coin of 92 @.@ 3 % silver content ( against 25 % silver content in the last debasement ) was issued within months . The bad coin prevailed over the good , however , because people had lost confidence . Northumberland admitted defeat and recruited the financial expert Thomas Gresham . After the first good harvest in four years , by late 1552 the currency was stable , prices for foodstuffs had dropped , and a basis for economic recovery had been laid . A process to centralise the administration of Crown revenue was underway and foreign debt had been eliminated .

 The use of the Book of Common Prayer became law in 1549 . King Edward 's half @-@ sister , Mary Tudor , de facto had licence to continue hearing mass in private . So soon as he was in power , Dudley put pressure on her to stop her from allowing her entire household and flocks of visitors to attend . Mary , who in her turn did not tolerate the Book of Common Prayer in any of her residences , was not prepared to make any concessions . She planned to flee the country but then could not make up her mind in the last minute . Mary denied Edward 's personal interest in the issue and entirely blamed John Dudley for her troubles . After a meeting with King and Council , in which she was told that what mattered was not her faith but her disobedience to the law , she sent the Imperial ambassador de Scheyfye to threaten war on England . The English government could not swallow a war threat from an ambassador who had stepped out of his commission , but at the same time would not risk all @-@ important commercial ties with the Habsburg Netherlands , so an embassy was sent to Brussels and some of Mary 's household officers were arrested . On his next visit to the Council , de Scheyfye was informed by the Earl of Warwick that the King of England had as much authority at 14 as he had at 40 — Dudley was alluding to Mary 's refusal to accept Edward 's demands on grounds of his young age . In the end a silent compromise came into effect : Mary continued to hear mass in a more private manner , while augmenting her landed property by exchanges with the Crown . 
 Appealing to the King 's religious tastes , John Dudley became the chief backer of evangelical Protestants among the clergy , promoting several to bishoprics — for example John Hooper and John Ponet . The English Reformation went on apace , despite its widespread unpopularity . The 1552 revised edition of the Book of Common Prayer rejected the doctrine of transubstantiation , and the Forty @-@ two Articles , issued in June 1553 , proclaimed justification by faith and denied the existence of purgatory . Despite these being cherished projects of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer , he was displeased with the way the government handled their issue . By 1552 the relationship between the primate and the Duke was icy . To prevent the Church from becoming independent of the state , Dudley was against Cranmer 's reform of canon law . He recruited the Scot John Knox so that he should , in Northumberland 's words , " be a whetstone to quicken and sharp the Bishop of Canterbury , whereof he hath need " . Knox refused to collaborate , but joined fellow reformers in a concerted preaching campaign against covetous men in high places . Cranmer 's canon law was finally wrecked by Northumberland 's furious intervention during the spring parliament of 1553 . On a personal level , though , the Duke was happy to help produce a schoolchildren 's <unk> in Latin and English . In June 1553 he backed the Privy Council 's invitation of Philip Melanchthon to become Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge University . But for the King 's death , Melanchthon would have come to England — his high travel costs had already been granted by Edward 's government . 
 At the heart of Northumberland 's problems with the episcopate lay the issue of the Church 's wealth , from the confiscation of which the government and its officials had profited ever since the Dissolution of the Monasteries . The most radical preachers thought that bishops , if needed at all , should be " <unk> " . This attitude was attractive to Dudley , as it conveniently allowed him to fill up the Exchequer or distribute rewards with Church property . When new bishops were appointed — typically to the sees of deprived conservative incumbents — they often had to surrender substantial land holdings to the Crown and were left with a much reduced income . The dire situation of the Crown finances made the Council resort to a further wave of Church expropriation in 1552 – 1553 , targeting chantry lands and Church plate . At the time and since , the break @-@ up and reorganisation of the Prince @-@ Bishopric of Durham has been interpreted as Dudley 's attempt to create himself a county palatine of his own . However , as it turned out , Durham 's entire revenue was allotted to the two successor bishoprics and the nearby border garrison of Norham Castle . Dudley received the stewardship of the new " King 's County Palatine " in the North ( worth £ 50 p.a. ) , but there was no further gain for him . Overall , Northumberland 's provisions for reorganised dioceses reveal a concern in him that " the preaching of the gospel " should not lack funds . Still , the confiscation of Church property as well as the lay government 's direction of Church affairs made the Duke disliked among clerics , whether Reformed or conservative . His relations with them were never worse than when the crisis of Edward 's final illness approached .

 The war policy 1547 – 1549 had entailed an extraordinary expenditure of about £ 350 @,@ 000 p.a. against a regular Crown income of £ 150 @,@ 000 p.a. It was impossible to continue in this way , and Dudley quickly negotiated a withdrawal of the besieged English garrison at Boulogne . The high costs of the garrison could thus be saved and French payments of redemption of roughly £ 180 @,@ 000 were a most welcome cash income . The peace with France was concluded in the Treaty of Boulogne in March 1550 . There was both public rejoicing and anger at the time , and some historians have condemned the peace as a shameful surrender of English @-@ held territory . A year later it was agreed that King Edward was to have a French bride , the six @-@ year @-@ old Elisabeth of Valois . The threat of war with Scotland was also neutralised , England giving up some isolated garrisons in exchange . In the peace treaty with Scotland of June 1551 , a joint commission , one of the first of its kind in history , was installed to agree upon the exact boundary between the two countries . This matter was concluded in August 1552 by French arbitration . Despite the cessation of hostilities , English defences were kept on a high level : nearly £ 200 @,@ 000 p.a. were spent on the navy and the garrisons at Calais and on the Scottish border . In his capacity as Warden @-@ General of the Scottish Marches , Northumberland arranged for the building of a new Italianate fortress at Berwick @-@ upon @-@ Tweed . 
 The war between France and the Emperor broke out once again in September 1551 . In due course Northumberland rejected requests for English help from both sides , which in the case of the Empire consisted of a demand for full @-@ scale war based on an Anglo @-@ Imperial treaty of 1542 . The Duke pursued a policy of neutrality , a balancing act that made peace between the two great powers attractive . In late 1552 he undertook to bring about a European peace by English mediation . These moves were taken seriously by the rival resident ambassadors , but were ended in June 1553 by the belligerents , the continuance of war being more advantageous to them .

 John Dudley recovered the post of Lord Admiral immediately after the Protector 's fall in October 1549 , Thomas Seymour having been executed by his brother in March 1549 . Dudley passed on the office to Edward Lord Clinton in May 1550 , yet never lost his keen interest in maritime affairs . Henry VIII had revolutionised the English navy , mainly in military terms . Dudley encouraged English voyages to far @-@ off coasts , ignoring Spanish threats . He even contemplated a raid on Peru with Sebastian Cabot in 1551 . Expeditions to Morocco and the Guinea coast in 1551 and 1552 were actually realised . A planned voyage to China via the Northeast passage under Hugh Willoughby sailed in May 1553 — King Edward watched their departure from his window . Northumberland was at the centre of a " maritime revolution " , a policy in which , increasingly , the English Crown sponsored long @-@ distance trade directly .

 The 15 @-@ year @-@ old King fell seriously ill in February 1553 . His sister Mary was invited to visit him , the Council doing " duty and obeisance to her as if she had been Queen of England " . The King recovered somewhat , and in April Northumberland restored Mary 's full title and arms as Princess of England , which she had lost in the 1530s . He also kept her informed about Edward 's condition . About this time a set of drawn @-@ out marriage negotiations came to conclusion . On 21 May 1553 Guildford Dudley , Northumberland 's second youngest son , married Lady Jane Grey , the fervently Protestant daughter of the Duke of Suffolk and , through her mother Frances Brandon , a grandniece of Henry VIII . Her sister Catherine was matched with the heir of the Earl of Pembroke , and another Katherine , Guildford 's younger sister , was promised to Henry Hastings , heir of the Earl of Huntingdon . Within a month the first of these marriages turned out to be highly significant . Although marked by magnificent festivities , at the time they took place the alliances were not seen as politically important , not even by the Imperial ambassador Jehan de Scheyfye , who was the most suspicious observer . Often perceived as proof of a conspiracy to bring the Dudley family to the throne , they have also been described as routine matches between aristocrats . 
 At some point during his illness Edward wrote a draft document headed " My devise for the Succession " . Due to his ardent Protestantism Edward did not want his Catholic sister Mary to succeed , but he was also preoccupied with male succession and with legitimacy , which in Mary 's and Elizabeth 's case was questionable as a result of Henry VIII 's legislation . In the first version of his " devise " , written before he knew he was mortally ill , Edward bypassed his half @-@ sisters and provided for the succession of male heirs only . Around the end of May or early June Edward 's condition worsened dramatically and he corrected his draft such that Lady Jane Grey herself , not just her putative sons , could inherit the Crown . To what extent Edward 's document — especially this last change — was influenced by Northumberland , his confidant John Gates , or still other members of the Privy Chamber like Edward 's tutor John Cheke or Secretary William Petre , is unclear . 
 Edward fully endorsed it . He personally supervised the copying of his will and twice summoned lawyers to his bedside to give them orders . On the second occasion , 15 June , Northumberland kept a watchful eye over the proceedings . Days before , the Duke had intimidated the judges who were raising legal objections to the " devise " . The next step was an engagement to perform the King 's will after his death , signed in his presence by Northumberland and 23 others . Finally , the King 's official " declaration " , issued as letters patent , was signed by 102 notables , among them the whole Privy Council , peers , bishops , judges , and London aldermen . Edward also announced to have it passed in parliament in September , and the necessary writs were prepared . 
 It was now common knowledge that Edward was dying . The Imperial ambassador , Jehan de Scheyfye , had been convinced for years that Dudley was engaged in some " mighty plot " to settle the Crown on his own head . As late as 12 June , though , he still knew nothing specific , despite having inside information about Edward 's sickness . France , which found the prospect of the Emperor 's cousin on the English throne disagreeable , gave indications of support to Northumberland . Since the Duke did not rule out an armed intervention from Charles V , he came back on the French offer after the King 's death , sending a secret and non @-@ committal mission to King Henry II . After Jane 's accession in July the ambassadors of both powers were convinced she would prevail , although they were in no doubt that the common people backed Mary . Antoine de Noailles wrote of Guildford Dudley as " the new King " , while the Emperor instructed his envoys to arrange themselves with the Duke and to discourage Mary from undertaking anything dangerous . 
 Whether altering the succession was Edward 's own idea or not , he was determinedly at work to exclude his half @-@ sisters in favour of what he perceived as his jeopardised legacy . The original provisions of the " devise " have been described as bizarre and obsessive and as typical of a teenager , while incompatible with the mind and needs of a <unk> politician . Mary 's accession could cost Northumberland his head , but not necessarily so . He tried hard to please her during 1553 , and may have shared the general assumption that she would succeed to the Crown as late as early June . Faced with Edward 's express royal will and perseverance , John Dudley submitted to his master 's wishes — either seeing his chance to retain his power beyond the boy 's lifetime or out of loyalty .

 Edward VI died on 6 July 1553 . The next morning Northumberland sent his son Robert into Hertfordshire with 300 men to secure the person of Mary Tudor . Aware of her half @-@ brother 's condition , the Princess had only days before moved to East Anglia , where she was the greatest landowner . She began to assemble an armed following and sent a letter to the Council , demanding to be recognised as queen . It arrived on 10 July , the day Jane Grey was proclaimed as queen . The Duke of Northumberland 's oration , held before Jane the previous day , did not move her to accept the Crown — her parents ' assistance was required for that . Dudley had not prepared for resolute action on Mary 's part and needed a week to build up a larger force . He was in a dilemma over who should lead the troops . He was the most experienced general in the kingdom , but he did not want to leave the government in the hands of his colleagues , in some of whom he had little confidence . Queen Jane decided the issue by demanding that her father , the Duke of Suffolk , should remain with her and the Council . On 14 July Northumberland headed for Cambridge with 1 @,@ 500 troops and some artillery , having reminded his colleagues of the gravity of the cause , " what chance of variance soever might grow amongst you in my absence " . 
 Supported by gentry and nobility in East Anglia and the Thames Valley , Mary 's military camp was gathering strength daily and , through luck , came into possession of powerful artillery from the royal navy . In the circumstances the Duke deemed fighting a campaign hopeless . The army proceeded from Cambridge to Bury St Edmunds and retreated again to Cambridge . On 20 July a letter from the Council in London arrived , declaring that they had proclaimed Queen Mary and commanding Northumberland to disband the army and await events . Dudley did not contemplate resistance . He explained to his fellow @-@ commanders that they had acted on the Council 's orders all the time and that he did not now wish " to combat the Council 's decisions , supposing that they have been moved by good reasons ... and I beg your lordships to do the same . " Proclaiming Mary Tudor at the market place , he threw up his cap and " so laughed that the tears ran down his cheeks for grief . " The next morning the Earl of Arundel arrived to arrest him . A week earlier Arundel had assured Northumberland of his wish to spill his blood even at the Duke 's feet ; now Dudley went down on his knees as soon as he caught sight of him . 
 Northumberland rode through the City of London to the Tower on 25 July , with his guards struggling to protect him against the hostile populace . A pamphlet appearing shortly after his arrest illustrated the general hatred of him : " the great devil Dudley <unk> , Duke I should have said " . He was now commonly thought to have poisoned King Edward while Mary " would have been as glad of her brother 's life , as the ragged bear is glad of his death " . Dumbfounded by the turn of events , the French ambassador Noailles wrote : " I have witnessed the most sudden change believable in men , and I believe that God alone worked it . " David Loades , biographer of both Queen Mary and John Dudley , concludes that the lack of fighting clouds the fact that this outcome was a close @-@ run affair , and warns 
 to explain Mary 's triumph over Jane simply in terms of overwhelming spontaneous support . Northumberland ... was completely unprepared for the crisis which eventually overtook him . He was already losing his grip upon the situation before the council defected , and that was why they did it . 
 = = = Trial and execution = = = 
 Northumberland was tried on 18 August 1553 in Westminster Hall . The panels of the jury and judges were largely made up of his former colleagues . Dudley hinted that he had acted on the authority of Prince and Council and by warrant of the Great Seal . Answered that the Great Seal of a usurper was worth nothing , he asked " whether any such persons as were equally culpable of that crime ... might be his judges " . After sentence was passed , he begged the Queen 's mercy for his five sons , the eldest of whom was condemned with him , the rest waiting for their trials . He also asked to " confess to a learned divine " and was visited by Bishop Stephen Gardiner , who had passed most of Edward 's reign in the Tower and was now Mary 's Lord Chancellor . The Duke 's execution was planned for 21 August at eight in the morning ; however , it was suddenly cancelled . Northumberland was instead escorted to St Peter ad Vincula , where he took the Catholic communion and professed that " the plagues that is upon the realm and upon us now is that we have erred from the faith these sixteen years . " A great propaganda coup for the new government , Dudley 's words were officially distributed — especially in the territories of the Emperor Charles V. In the evening the Duke learnt " that I must prepare myself against tomorrow to receive my deadly stroke " , as he wrote in a desperate plea to the Earl of Arundel : " O my good lord remember how sweet life is , and how bitter ye contrary . " On the scaffold , before 10 @,@ 000 people , Dudley confessed his guilt but maintained :
