 Within the memorial the architects added an inner shrine , or Record Room , in which could be recorded the names of the South Australians who fell during the war . While the design did not specify the exact form that this would take , in the completed memorial these names are inscribed in the bronzes that line the walls . The design also allowed for a cenotaph within the inner shrine , which the designers suggested could either be used as a symbolic representation of the unknown soldier or as the marker to an actual grave , although this aspect was never realised . 
 The monument is designed to honour both the war dead and all who served in the war — one face being inscribed to those who died in the war , while the other is dedicated to " all who served " . On the obverse side is inscribed the words " To perpetuate the courage , loyalty , and sacrifice of those who served in the Great War 1914 – 1918 " , while the reverse states " All honour give to those who , nobly striving , nobly fell that we might live " . Above the two entrances to the inner shrine were to be inscribed the names of the major theaters in which Australians served in the Great War . Originally it was suggested that this was to be Egypt , Gallipoli and Palestine on one side , with France on the other , but in the final work Belgium was added to the list . 
 Although the central square mile of the City of Adelaide is designed to the points of the compass , the monument sits at a 45 degree angle to North Terrace . The architects provided two reasons for this . First , it was observed that " monuments suffer materially from monotonous lighting " when they face to the south ; and second , the placing of the monument to face a north @-@ west direction allows it to be in line with both the Cross of Sacrifice and St. Peter 's Cathedral . In addition to these two arguments , Richardson also notes that the diagonal positioning of the memorial permits the dawn sun to fall on the facade .

 Although the National War Memorial was initially proposed as a memorial to those who served in " The Great War " , the site has since grown to incorporate a number of smaller memorials . These include a memorial to the Battle of Lone Pine ; the " French Memorial " , which commemorates those who fought and died in France during the first and second World Wars ; an honour roll of those who died in World War II ; and the " Australian Armed Forces Memorial " , encompassing the Malayan Emergency of 1948 – 1960 , the Korean War , the Indonesia @-@ Malaysia confrontation in Borneo , and the Vietnam War . In addition , the wall which surrounds the northern and western sides of the site features the six " Crosses of Memory " — a series of " simple wooden crosses " commemorating the Siege of Tobruk from 1941 and the 10th , 27th , 48th and 50th battalions of 1916 .

 " Things Which Have Never Yet Been Done " is the ninth episode of the second season , and the nineteenth episode overall , of the Canadian science fiction television series Orphan Black . It first aired in Canada on Space and the United States on BBC America on 14 June 2014 . The episode was written by Alex Levine and directed by TJ Scott . 
 The series focuses on a number of identical human clones , all of whom are played by Tatiana Maslany : Sarah Manning , Alison Hendrix , Cosima Niehaus , Rachel Duncan , and Helena .

Alison and her husband Donnie ( Kristian Bruun ) attempt to bury Dr. Aldous Leekie 's body , while Helena attempts to escape from the ranch of the Proletheans , a religious extremist group . 
 " Things Which Have Never Yet Been Done " marked the first on @-@ screen appearance of Kathryn Alexandre , who also works on the show as Maslany 's " clone double " when filming scenes where multiple clones interact . The episode was filmed at various locations in Toronto and the title was taken from Francis Bacon 's work Novum Organum . It was watched by 613 @,@ 000 viewers in the United States and received mostly positive reviews from critics .

 At the Dyad Institute , Rachel appoints Delphine Cormier ( <unk> Brochu ) the interim director of the cloning program following the death of Dr. Aldous Leekie . Delphine meets with Sarah to ask if her young daughter , Kira , will donate her bone marrow to help cure Cosima 's illness , and Kira agrees . Meanwhile , Cosima works with her lab assistant Scott ( Josh Vokey ) and Rachel 's adoptive father Ethan ( Andrew Gillies ) , a founder scientist of the cloning program , to find the genetic sequence that has caused her illness . Rachel , who is usually stoic , laughs and sobs whilst watching home videos of her childhood , lamenting her own infertility . Disguised as Sarah , she tricks her way into the pediatric clinic where Kira is recovering and sedates Sarah 's foster brother Felix ( Jordan <unk> ) . She abducts Kira and takes her to a young girl 's bedroom in the Dyad Institute , telling Kira that she " may even grow to like it here , just as I did " . 
 After confessing that he accidentally murdered Dr. Leekie , Donnie Hendrix and his wife Alison decide to dispose of the dead body under the cement of their garage floor . They are interrupted by Vic ( Michael Mando ) , whom Alison met in rehab and who is acting as an informant to Detective Angie DeAngelis ( Inga <unk> ) . Donnie threatens to shoot Vic , who confesses that Angie is parked nearby , before walking into Angie 's van and threatening to destroy her career if she continues to stalk his family , taking a picture of her with Vic as blackmail . After burying Leekie 's body and re @-@ laying the cement , Alison confesses her sudden attraction to Donnie and they have sex in the garage . 
 At the ranch inhabited by the Proletheans , a religious extremist group , following her impregnation , Helena is introduced to the group 's nursery where she bonds with a young girl . The <unk> leader , Henrik <unk> ( Peter Outerbridge ) , impregnates his teenage daughter Gracie ( Zoé de Grand <unk> ) with his and Helena 's embryos . Sharing their displeasure with what Henrik has done , Helena and Gracie decide to flee the ranch together , but are caught by Henrik as they are preparing to leave . Henrik 's protégé and Gracie 's lover , Mark ( Ari Millen ) , arrives to defend Gracie . Mark and Gracie flee together as Helena attacks Henrik . Helena tortures Henrik with his own medical instruments before burning down the ranch and running away herself .

 Kathryn Alexandre appeared for the first time in this episode as Alexis , a <unk> midwife . After working as a script reader during Orphan Black 's initial auditions , Alexandre began working as Maslany 's " clone double " : playing opposite Maslany in any scene when multiple clones interact and being replaced with Maslany in post @-@ production . Fawcett and Manson had planned to cast Alexandre in her own role from the start of the show 's second season , and had considered casting her as Gracie before deciding that , due to the amount of interaction between Gracie and Helena ( played by Maslany ) , it would " turn into a mess if we cast her " . They decided to find a smaller role for Alexandre and eventually settled on the part of Alexis . 
 The scenes in the <unk> ' garage were filmed on a set ; the set replicated the real garage of a house in Markham , Ontario which had been used for filming in the show 's first season . The set was built 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) above the ground so that it could be excavated with a jackhammer on film . <unk> Health Centre stood in as the clinic where Kira underwent bone marrow extraction , and was also used for exterior shots of the Dyad Institute . Scenes at Cosima 's laboratory were filmed at the Don Jail , now an administrative facility connected to <unk> . The montage of Rachel drinking martinis and watching home videos from her childhood was not originally included in the episode 's script , nor was it filmed with the rest of the episode . According to Fawcett , when he and Manson viewed the final cut of the episode , they felt that something was missing from Rachel 's subplot . Manson then scripted the short sequence and Fawcett filmed it over two days during the production of the next episode . Due to time constraints while filming the scene in which Helena tortures Henrik , the scene was shot with a handheld camera by the episode 's director , TJ Scott , with Maslany and Outerbridge improvising the dialogue and use of props . The subsequent shot of the barn on fire was created by the visual effects company Intelligent Creatures . The title of the final two episodes , " Things Which Have Never Yet Been Done " and " By Means Which Have Never Yet Been Tried " , are taken from a Francis Bacon quotation in his philosophical work Novum Organum : " It would be an unsound fancy and self @-@ contradictory to expect that things which have never yet been done can be done except by means which have never yet been tried .

 Matt Brennan of Slant Magazine summarised the episode as being " among the best hours of television I 've seen so far this year " and an example of " unrelenting brilliance " . He praised the exploration of Rachel 's character and especially Maslany 's " nothing short of masterful " performance in the role , and described the satire of suburbia presented through Alison and Donnie as " impeccably wry " . Writing for The A.V. Club , Caroline Framke gave the episode an A – grade and found it much more focused and with more of an " emotional core " than the preceding episode . She highlighted the " gorgeous " cinematography , the chemistry between Maslany and Bruun as Alison and Donnie , and the " stunning " montage of Rachel 's emotional breakdown . IGN 's Eric Goldman has described the episode as a " very busy , very strong " episode and among the best of the season . He praised the " darkly funny " storyline involving Alison and Donnie , although he found the pacing of some of the subplots to be rushed . 
 Paste critic Mark <unk> gave the episode a rating of 8 @.@ 4 out of 10 , commending Bruun 's performance as Donnie and the " wonderful bit of Coen Brothers @-@ esque dark comedy " provided by Alison 's subplot . However , he criticised the predictability of the episode and opined that Kira 's abduction by Rachel felt like a recycled plot point from the first season . Vlada Gelman gave the episode a mixed review for TVLine , writing that it was the first episode of the show 's second season " that didn 't quite work " and " it didn 't have the momentum and progress you 'd expect from a penultimate hour " . Similarly , The New York Times 's Adam W. Kepler opined that the episode displayed Orphan Black 's " finest qualities ( strong characterisation , dark satire and shocking moments ) and its worst ( odd pacing and ropey plotting ) " . He enjoyed Alison and Donnie 's comedic subplot and praised Maslany 's performance as Rachel , but found the conclusion to Helena 's storyline with the Proletheans " baffling " and " haphazard " .

 = Mullum Malarum = 
 Mullum Malarum ( English : Thorn and Flower ) is a 1978 Indian Tamil @-@ language drama film written and directed by J. Mahendran and produced by Venu Chettiar and V. Mohan , with a soundtrack by Ilaiyaraaja . The film , starring Rajinikanth , Sarath Babu , Fatafat Jayalaxmi and Shoba , marked Mahendran 's directorial debut and is loosely based on Umachandran 's novel of the same name . It tells the story of Kali , a winch operator who dotes on his sister and clashes with Kumaran , his superior , at a power plant ; the dispute eventually costs him his left arm and his job . 
 The film 's production was tumultuous . Chettiar opposed casting Rajinikanth as the protagonist because of his dark skin and typecasting as a villain at the time , but Mahendran refused to direct the film without the actor and Chettiar capitulated . Since Mahendran had no previous directing experience , cinematographer Balu Mahendra ( a director himself ) assisted Mahendran with the screenplay , dialogue , camera angles , casting and editing . The film significantly deviates from the novel , with Mahendran having read only a part of it . Filming lasted for roughly 30 days , and primarily took place in Sringeri , Ooty , <unk> and <unk> . Chettiar was surprised that the finished film had less dialogue than visuals , which he did not expect from Mahendran . 
 Although Mullum Malarum opened to a tepid box office reception at its 15 August 1978 ( Independence Day ) release , positive reviews from critics and favourable word of mouth helped make it a success . Rajinikanth 's performance as Kali received unanimous praise , and it is widely considered the best performance of his career . The film won the Filmfare Award for Best Film – Tamil and two Tamil Nadu State Film Awards : Best Film and a Special Prize for Rajinikanth , who also won the Arima Sangam Award for Best Actor 
 Mullum Malarum , a breakthrough for Rajinikanth , became a milestone in Tamil cinema ; it focused on visual realism , without excessive melodrama , fights , duets or dialogue . The film 's success inspired remakes in 1979 ( <unk> Oru <unk> in Malayalam ) and 1985 ( <unk> <unk> in Hindi ) . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Kali is a winch operator at a village power plant . Although a reputed troublemaker , he occasionally does good deeds for the local community . Kali and his younger sister Valli — to whom he is devoted — were orphaned during their childhood and have no close family . When a poor wanderer named Manga and her aged mother arrive in the village with no assets and no @-@ one to assist them , Valli helps them set up their home in the village . Although Manga becomes fond of Kali , he is disgusted by her fondness for food . 
 The power plant 's new supervising engineer is Kumaran , an austere but fair boss . His relationship with Kali is difficult , worsening after he sees the latter 's negative side in a series of incidents , which included Kali allowing people to ride the winch in violation of the power plant 's rules . Kali calls Kumaran " Law Point " because of his strict application of the rules . One day when Kali is on duty , Manga teases him ; he abandons the winch and chases her . In his absence , an emergency arises at the plant . An enraged Kumaran suspends Kali from his job the following day for dereliction of duty , ignoring his protests and threats . 
 Kali becomes drunk and faints in the middle of the road ; a lorry runs over his left arm , which is later amputated . He cannot perform his job with one arm , and is fired . Now unemployed , Kali directs his anger and frustration at Kumaran ; Manga feels guilty because she is responsible for Kali 's plight . At Valli 's request , she marries Kali and takes care of him . 
 Kumaran is attracted to Valli , and asks Kali for permission to marry her . Because he hates his former boss , Kali arranges for Valli to marry Murugesa , a philandering grocer . Although Manga opposes Kali 's decision , he stubbornly refuses her plea to allow his sister to marry Kumaran . Manga decides to arrange the marriage without his consent . 
 On the day Murugesa is supposed to marry Valli at his house , Kali learns that the entire village has left to attend Valli 's marriage to Kumaran . He intercepts Valli 's group , reminding her that he loves her and how difficult it would be to live without her . Although everyone else ignores him , Valli runs to him and assures him that she would never abandon him . Kali then tells Kumaran that although he still dislikes his former boss , he and Valli have his permission to marry .

 Mullum Malarum is based on a novel of the same name by Umachandran which was published in the Tamil magazine , Kalki . The story , about the love between a brother and sister , won the first prize in Kalki 's Novel Short Story Competition celebrating the magazine 's 1966 silver jubilee . Screenplay and dialogue writer J. Mahendran read only a part of Umachandran 's novel , but was particularly impressed by the winch operator Kali and his affection for his sister , as well as the loss of his arm . He outlined Mullum Malarum to producer Venu Chettiar , who was impressed . Adapting Umachandran 's novel for the screen , Mahendran made his directing debut and wrote the film 's dialogue . His screenplay diverged from the novel 's plot , and he decided to make a minimalist , visually @-@ rich film without melodrama , overacting , excessive dialogue or duets . A significant difference is that in the novel , Kali loses his arm to a tiger while in the film , he loses it due to it being run over by a lorry . 
 Chettiar and V. Mohan produced Mullum Malarum for <unk> Films , although only Mohan was credited in the opening credits . Ramasamy was signed as art director , and D. Vasu as editor . Ashok Kumar and Ramachandra Babu were the initial choices for cinematographer , but actor Kamal Haasan recommended Balu Mahendra for the job , which Mahendran accepted , leading to Mahendra making his debut in Tamil cinema . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Chettiar disagreed with Mahendran 's wish to cast Rajinikanth in the lead role because of the actor 's dark skin and his then typecasting as a villain . Mahendran refused to direct the film if Rajinikanth was not cast , not because Rajinikanth was his close friend , but because he felt that the actor was 100 % close to the character , and Chettiar capitulated . He was still unhappy with the director 's decision and called it " ridiculous " and " preposterous " every time he visited the set . Rajinikanth , dismayed at the producer 's lack of confidence in his acting , promised to " put his heart and soul into the character Kali " . The actor received ₹ 13 @,@ 000 ( about US $ 1 @,@ 579 @.@ 59 in 1978 ) for his part in the film . 
 Shoba was cast as Kali 's sister Valli , Sarath Babu as the engineer Kumaran and Fatafat Jayalaxmi as Kali 's love interest , Manga . Mahendran decided to characterise Manga as a " foodie who loves fish " after being inspired by Sringeri 's marine environment . Latha said that she had to refuse a part in the film due to scheduling conflicts . Mahendran cast <unk> Moorthy as Murugesa , the philandering grocer , and <unk> was the given the part as one of Kali 's henchmen . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Mullum Malarum was filmed on 35 mm <unk> colour film . The film intentionally defied traditional Tamil cinema conventions , discarding elements which Mahendran disliked . Mahendra later professed to avoid incorporating the usual hero @-@ heroine dancing into the film as he thought it was like " watching two drunken monkeys dancing " . Instead , he allocated music to the background only , at times when the lead characters were expressing their emotions . Since Mahendran had no previous directing experience , Mahendra assumed principal responsibility and responded to Mahendran 's specifications for the screenplay , dialogue , camera angles , casting and editing . 
 Although Chettiar held up production by not <unk> a scene set before the song " Senthazham Poovil " , Kamal Haasan funded the scene . Mullum Malarum was shot in Sringeri , Ooty , <unk> and Chennai in about 30 days , with the winch @-@ operating scenes filmed in <unk> . Sarath Babu was originally supposed to lip sync the full " Senthazham Poovil " scene involving him and Shoba , but Balu Mahendra and Mahendran agreed on a montage after the actor performed a line or two , much to his disappointment . Chettiar was perplexed by the finished film 's lack of dialogue , since he hired Mahendran as director due to his successful stint as a screenplay and dialogue writer , and did not expect such a visually @-@ rich film from him . Mullum Malarum 's final length was 3 @,@ 915 @.@ 46 metres ( 12 @,@ 846 @.@ 0 ft ) . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Naman Ramachandran notes in Rajinikanth : The Definitive Biography ( 2012 ) that Umachandran 's novel and Mahendran 's film metaphorically liken the sibling relationship to flowers which need sharp thorns to protect them . Vikram Venkateswaran of The Quint described Kali as the " thorn " protecting his sister , the " flower " . S. <unk> wrote in the 2015 book Popular Cinema and Politics in South India : The Films of MGR and Rajinikanth that Kali is both a thorn and a flower throughout the film : an " angry young man with a kind heart " , who does not admit mistakes ( despite many , such as breaking car headlights and allowing people to ride the winch in violation of the power plant 's rules ) . He also noted that films like Mullum Malarum stereotype the poor as representing " all that is pristine and traditional " , adding , " The overall socio @-@ economic system , which has made them poor , is unchallenged . Within the system , however , the hero will be ' richer ' in terms of his moral uprightness . " The 2012 book Grand Brand Rajini by P. C. Balasubramanian and Ram N. Ramakrishnan describes Kali as " the loving brother , the angry worker and despondent physically challenged person rolled into one . " 
 According to French film historian Yves Thoraval , the film 's theme is " the Oedipal possessiveness of a married brother for his younger sister " . Ramachandran notes that like the characters in Bairavi ( 1978 ) , Kali and his sister have abusive parents in childhood and he is responsible for his sister 's welfare . Unlike Bairavi , the siblings in Mullum Malarum are not separated ; this leads Kali 's protectiveness of Valli to the brink of obsession . In one scene , after he violently berates her during the day , he puts henna on her feet at night while she is asleep . 
 Ramachandran regards egotism as one of the central themes in Mullum Malarum , with Kali , the community 's alpha male , surrounded by sycophants who compliment him . He plays God in allowing the villagers to ride the winch ( saving them the exertion of walking ) , and is jolted when the supervising engineer Kumaran arrives . As a subordinate , Kali cannot oppose Kumaran ; his frustration threatens to erupt several times before it finally does and he is suspended . His feelings can be summed up in the line , " Raman <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , naan <unk> da en <unk> <unk> " ( English : " It doesn 't matter whether Rama or Ravana is reigning , I am king of my conscience " ) , in resistance to Kumaran 's authoritarian yoke . 
 According to Cinema Vision India , the film 's theme is " that people change — and they must " . Ramachandran notes that when Kali 's arm is amputated , he feels helpless and emasculated ; Kumaran , his bête noire , becomes an easy target , adding that Kali refuses to see the benefits of his sister marrying a wealthy , educated man ( even when Valli and his wife Manga ask for his consent ) , but sees the error of his ways when Valli abandons her defiant wedding preparations to join her brother : " My sister has shown all of you that I am the most important person in her life . I need only that happiness for the rest of my life . And it is with that pride and arrogance that I give my permission for my sister to marry . "

 Mullum Malarum 's soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja , with lyrics by Panchu Arunachalam , Gangai Amaran and Kannadasan . The soundtrack album , released by EMI Records , includes only four of the film 's five songs ; " Maan <unk> " was omitted . Mullum Malarum features no duets , which is considered rare in Tamil cinema . Elements from " Raman <unk> " were later used in " Machi Open the Bottle " , composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja for Mankatha ( 2011 ) . " Senthazham Poovil " was the title track of a compilation album of K. J. Yesudas songs which was released by Saregama . 
 The soundtrack and score were received positively . A 25 August 1978 review in The Hindu described Ilaiyaraja 's melodies as " delicious " and a folk @-@ dancing scene had a " delightful rhythm " . According to a 1978 issue of the Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan , Ilaiyaraaja composed his four songs with " strands of sweetness " . Director Mani Ratnam said in a conversation with film critic Baradwaj Rangan that there was " something really special " about Mullum Malarum 's music , and because of it the film " really stood out " . D. Karthikeyan of The Hindu singled out the film 's re @-@ recording in July 2011 , ranking it with the music director 's other films Uthiripookkal ( 1979 ) , Moondram Pirai ( 1982 ) , Nayakan ( 1987 ) and Thalapathi ( 1991 ) .

 Although Mullum Malarum was passed by the Central Board of Film Certification on 4 August 1978 , there were problems with its release . After Kamal Haasan 's intervention , it was released on 15 August , India 's Independence Day . The film 's commercial performance during its first few weeks was poor . Chettiar , who despaired of the film 's success and thought he was " doomed " , refused to underwrite any more publicity : " A good product needs no publicity , whereas a bad product cannot be pushed in the market however much you publicise it " . During its third or fourth week of release , positive magazine reviews and word of mouth spread ; Mullum Malarum became a commercial success , with a 100 @-@ day theatrical run . Chettiar apologised to Mahendran and offered him a blank cheque , to which he politely refused . The director instead thanked him for " letting him make a movie with Rajinikanth " . 
 After he saw the film , Rajinikanth 's mentor , director K. Balachander , wrote a letter of appreciation : " I 'm proud to have introduced you as an actor . " Balachander 's letter has been described by Sify as Rajinikanth 's " most prized moment and possession " . Following its success , Mullum Malarum was remade in Malayalam by <unk> <unk> as <unk> Oru <unk> ( 1979 ) and in Hindi by Bapu as <unk> <unk> ( 1985 ) .

 Mullum Malarum received positive reviews upon release . The Name is Rajinikanth ( 2008 ) by Gayathri Sreekanth states that the critics said , " Finally Tamil cinema is coming of age . Movies are getting more visual . " A 25 August 1978 review in The Hindu stated that the film " reflects the healthy trend towards a simple short story , vivid picturisation of sylvan scenery , arresting characterisation , catchy folk tunes and picturesque rustic dances that seem to have caught on among our film producers , instead of the usual formula of fights , duets , intrigues and cabaret dances ... Mahendran has handled the theme deftly . [ Rajinikanth ] shows his mature artistry in a portrayal of a turbulent illiterate worker with a blind passion for his sister . " It also praised the performances of Shoba and Jayalaxmi , and called Balu Mahendra 's camera work a " feast for the eyes " , noting that although the first half of the film moves at a " leisurely pace " , the second half is " eventful " . 
 Ananda Vikatan said in a 3 September 1978 review , " Mahendran has demonstrated amazing film making skills in this film ... He has told the story in a sharp manner without long dialogues and makes us expect the same quality of films from him in future ... The film exhibits Tamil culture throughout . The characters created history in a village atmosphere . We get the satisfaction of travelling to our village after seeing the film . This flower is one of those rarest <unk> flowers in Tamil Cinema . " After seeing Mullum Malarum , the @-@ then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. G. Ramachandran told the director : 
 I have no words to express my happiness . With this ﬁlm , you have set a new trend in Tamil Cinema . You have achieved a milestone , which even if l had desired , l could not have achieved . You have demonstrated clearly that Cinema is a visual medium and have succeeded in that also . The <unk> which came till now on brother @-@ sister relationships were full of dramatics , including mine . However , this ﬁlm stands apart and stands tall in realism . The last scene is new not only to Tamil Cinema but also to Indian <unk> l felt like getting up and clapping . Rajni has acted wonderfully and realistically and this ﬁlm will mark a big turnaround in his ﬁlm career .

" In May 2013 , director Dhanapal Padmanabhan told K. Jeshi of The Hindu that Mullum Malarum " scores on content , craft and extraordinary screenplay . " In October 2010 , <unk> Lal of The Times of India wrote that Mullum Malarum " revealed the potential of Rajini , the character actor . " Also in The Times of India , Kamini Mathai wrote : " The fact that Mahendran and Balachander entered the world of cinema as writers shows in the strong storylines and dialogues of their films such as Mahendran 's Mullum Malarum ( 1978 ) and Balachander 's Apoorva Raagangal ( 1975 ) and <unk> <unk> ( 1981 ) . " 
 In August 2009 , M. Suganth of The Times of India rated the film 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 . Naman Ramachandran considered Rajinikanth 's Kali an effective portrayal of a challenging , complex character . He praised Balu Mahendra 's cinematography , especially his use of natural light . In December 2014 , Gautaman Bhaskaran of the Hindustan Times wrote : " On watching [ Apoorva Raagangal and Mullum Malarum ] recently , there was no mistaking the brilliance of [ Rajinikanth 's ] acting ability . In both , he essays shades of deep grey , and yet there was something captivating about Rajinikanth . " 
 In December 2011 , the Press Trust of India said that Rajinikanth also " proved his acting mettle in challenging roles " in films such as Mullum Malarum . Rediff described the film in August 2015 as one of Rajinikanth 's best of the 20 he released in 1978 . According to Maalai Malar , Rajinikanth lived through his role as Kali . The newspaper praised Shoba 's acting , described Balu Mahendra 's cinematography as on an international level and called Mullum Malarum one of those few films which could not be destroyed by time . S. R.

 In addition to its critical and commercial success , Mullum Malarum became a milestone in Tamil cinema . Discarding traditional melodrama , fights , duet songs and extensive dialogue , the film focused on visual realism . Gayathri Sreekanth wrote in The Name is Rajinikanth that it " gave a new dimension to brother and sister relations on screen " and established Rajinikanth as an " actor par finesses " . Although he was praised for his performance in what was seen as an experimental film , during the 1990s he stopped acting in similar films because he had become a " larger @-@ than @-@ life " hero . 
 Director Prabhu Solomon said that Rajinikanth 's character inspired Vikram Prabhu 's protagonist in <unk> ( 2012 ) . " Kali " became Rajinikanth 's most @-@ frequent onscreen name ; his characters in Murattu Kaalai ( 1980 ) , Kai <unk> Kai ( 1984 ) , Kaali ( 1980 ) and Athisaya Piravi ( 1990 ) were also named Kali .

 = Christchurch , Dorset = 
 Christchurch / <unk> / is a borough and town on the south coast of England . The town adjoins Bournemouth in the west and the New Forest lies to the east . Historically in the county of Hampshire , it became part of the administrative county of Dorset in the 1974 reorganisation of local government . Covering an area of 19 @.@ 5 square miles ( 51 km2 ) , Christchurch had a 2011 population of 54 @,@ 210 , making it the fourth most populous town in Dorset , closely behind Weymouth which has a population of 54 @,@ 539 . 
 Founded in the 7th century at the confluence of the rivers Avon and Stour which flow into Christchurch Harbour , the town was originally named Twynham but became known as Christchurch following the construction of the priory in 1094 . The town developed into an important trading port and was fortified in the 9th century . Further defences were added in the 12th century with the construction of a castle which was destroyed by the Parliamentarian Army during the English Civil War . During the 18th and 19th centuries smuggling flourished in Christchurch and became one of the town 's most lucrative industries . The town was heavily fortified during Second World War as a precaution against an expected invasion and in 1940 an Airspeed factory was established on the town 's airfield which manufactured aircraft for the Royal Air Force . 
 The town 's harbour , beaches , nature reserves and historically important buildings have made Christchurch a popular tourist destination attracting some 1 @.@ 5 million visitors a year . Bournemouth Airport , an international airport which handles approximately 800 @,@ 000 passengers a year , is located within the borough boundary at Hurn . The airport 's industrial park contains a number of aerospace and engineering businesses and is one of the largest employment sites in Dorset . Christchurch is a popular destination for retirees and has one of the oldest populations in the country with 30 per cent of residents aged over 65 . 
 = = History = = 
 Christchurch was founded in approximately 650 AD by missionaries sent to Wessex by St <unk> , the first Bishop of Dorchester ( Oxfordshire ) . They settled on a stretch of raised land between the rivers Avon and Stour which carried people and their wares to and from settlements such as Blandford and Old Sarum ( Salisbury ) . The harbour became one of the most important in Saxon England as it was easily reached from the continent and boats could travel up the river Avon to Salisbury . The town appears in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle entry of 901 as <unk> ( Twynham ) from Old English <unk> ( between ) and <unk> ( rivers ) . In around 890 AD , Alfred the Great considered Twynham to be of such strategic importance that , with the threat of invasion by the Danes , he made it a burh and defensive walls were erected around the town . In 1094 a chief minister of King William II , Ranulf Flambard , then Dean of Twynham , began the building of a priory on the site of the original mission church . Soon after the construction of the priory the town became known as Christchurch . 
 Some time in the early 12th century , a castle was built within the town . Originally a wooden fort built by Richard de Redvers , first cousin to King Henry I , it was rebuilt in stone by Baldwin de Redvers to resist King Stephen during the civil war with the Empress Matilda . The castle again saw action during the Civil War of 1642 – 1651 when occupied by the Parliamentarians . Christchurch changed hands a number of times : originally under Royalist control , it was captured by Sir William Waller 's Parliamentary army in 1644 . Lord Goring briefly retook the town in 1645 but was obliged to withdraw and returned with a larger force days later and laid siege to the castle . However , the Parliamentarians withstood the siege and maintained their hold on the town . Fearing such a powerful stronghold might once again fall into Royalist hands , Cromwell ordered the castle to be destroyed in 1652 . 
 Although the fishing industry thrived in Christchurch , the importance of the harbour declined as it became inaccessible to vessels of a large draught . The harbour entrance was particularly troublesome with constantly shifting sandbars . In 1665 Edward Hyde , Earl of Clarendon , bought the Lordship of the Manor of Christchurch . As part of his plans to improve trade in the town , he attempted to resolve the problems with the harbour entrance by cutting a new one through the sandspit at the foot of Hengistbury Head . However , upon completion the new entrance repeatedly silted up and in 1703 a large storm damaged a groyne which blocked the entrance entirely . Over the following 150 years alternative schemes were proposed but none were ever taken up . 
 Smuggling was one of Christchurch 's most lucrative industries during the 18th and 19th centuries due to easy access to neighbouring towns and the difficult harbour entrance which acted as a barrier to customs cutters . Many townspeople were involved in this illegal trade and large quantities of wealth were accumulated . In 1784 a confrontation between a gang of local smugglers and Customs and Excise officers led to the Battle of Mudeford in which a Royal Navy officer was killed and a smuggler subsequently executed . Another important industry during this period was the manufacture of <unk> chains for watches and clocks . In 1790 , Robert Cox began to manufacture <unk> chains in workshops in the High Street . By 1793 Cox gained a monopoly on chain production in Britain , supplying watch , clock and chronometer makers throughout the country . In 1845 William Hart opened a similar factory in Bargates . However , by 1875 the chains were no longer required due to changes in watch designs and the factories were closed . 
 The railway came to Christchurch in 1847 although the nearest station , Christchurch Road , was at <unk> and passengers were taken the rest of the way by omnibus . In 1862 a new station was built in the town close to where it stands today and was served by a branch line from Ringwood . Christchurch joined the mainline in 1883 and a third station had to be built . Christchurch , and in particular Mudeford , had been enjoying a modest tourist trade since King George III had patronised the town in the 1790s but the arrival of the railways made Christchurch accessible to more potential visitors . A power station was built in Christchurch in 1903 to power the public trams . The excess generated was sufficient to light the town and in 1940 it was added to the national grid . 
 In 1930 , the Fisher Aviation Company began to provide flights from fields at the eastern end of Somerford Road and by 1933 the company had flown over 19 @,@ 000 passengers . In 1934 they obtained permission to establish an aerodrome on the site which became known as Christchurch Airfield . During the Second World War an Airspeed factory was built on the airfield and began manufacturing aircraft for the RAF and in 1944 the USAAF Ninth Air Force established a base there . A second aerodrome opened at Hurn in 1944 which became Bournemouth Airport . In 1940 , with the German 6th Army at Cherbourg , Christchurch was fortified against an expected invasion : the construction of pillboxes , gun emplacements and tank traps in and around the town , made Christchurch an " anti @-@ tank island " . Between 1941 and 1942 Donald Bailey developed the Bailey bridge at the Military Engineering Experimental Establishment at Christchurch Barracks . 
 Much development with a large increase in housing occurred from the mid @-@ 18th century . In 1873 , 300 acres ( 120 ha ) of common land north of the town known as <unk> was enclosed and built upon and the town 's population rapidly expanded . During the 20th century further development has seen the population grown from a little over 11 @,@ 000 to more than 45 @,@ 000 . In the 1950s a large housing estate was built to the east of the town centre and in 1958 a bypass was constructed which redirected traffic using the town 's high street as the main thoroughfare to and from London and Southampton . In 1974 the town was transferred from the county of Hampshire to Dorset following local government reorganisation and was granted borough status by a Royal Charter . 
 = = Governance = = 
 Christchurch is a local government district which has borough status . It is the smallest of Dorset County Council 's six districts and one of the smallest boroughs in England by population . The district was formed by the merger of the Municipal Borough of Christchurch with part of Ringwood and Fordingbridge Rural District in 1974 . Since then it has been part of the non @-@ metropolitan county of Dorset . It has some large rural areas including Bournemouth International Airport and the parishes of Burton and Hurn . For local elections the borough is divided into 12 wards containing 24 councillors . Elections take place every four years ; the last election took place in 2015 resulting in the Conservatives retaining overall control with 21 seats . The Mayor of Christchurch for 2014 – 2015 is Conservative councillor Denise Jones and the Deputy Mayor is Nick Geary ( Conservative ) . In existence since at least 1297 , Christchurch 's Office of Mayor is now mainly a ceremonial role with little power . The Council Leader is Ray <unk> who has served as a Conservative councillor since 2007 . 
 Christchurch is represented by a single parliamentary constituency in the House of Commons . The seat was created in 1983 from parts of the Christchurch and Lymington , North Dorset and New Forest constituencies . It had been held by Robert <unk> ( Conservative ) since its creation until his death in 1993 . At the by @-@ election Diana Maddock ( Liberal Democrat ) was elected in one of the largest ever swings ( 35 @.@ 4 % ) against the sitting party .

 = = Geography = = 
 Christchurch is the most easterly coastal town of Dorset and lies within the historic county boundaries of Hampshire . The town abuts Bournemouth to the west and is approximately 9 miles ( 14 km ) east of Poole , 20 miles ( 32 km ) west of Southampton , 23 miles ( 37 km ) south of Salisbury . The town centre lies between the rivers Avon and Stour which flow directly into Christchurch Harbour . The borough boundaries stretch to Hurn Forest in the north encompassing Bournemouth Airport and eastwards along the coast as far as Walkford . The River Stour forms a natural boundary to the west ; the estuary and harbour form the southern boundary . 
 Christchurch Harbour contains large areas of salt marsh and is protected by a sandbar known as Mudeford Spit which has fine sandy beach on both sides of a walkway lined with beach huts . The harbour is protected by a natural headland ( Hengistbury Head ) at the start of the sandbanks , and is a special site for sand martins which nest annually in the sandy cliffs . The harbour is only accessible to shallow draught boats drawing up to 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) due to the sandbars at the entrance . The entrance , known as the Run , has Mudeford Quay on one side and the spit on the other . Considerable tides flow here : up to 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6 @.@ 9 mph ) during spring tides . The harbour is a protected wildlife refuge and is home to large populations of swans , waders and other bird life . On the south side , the harbour is enclosed by Hengistbury Head which was the site of the earliest settlement here dating back to the Bronze Age . The landward end of the headland has a bank and ditch known as Double Dykes , built in about 700 BC , to protect the ancient settlement . 
 <unk> Marsh is a 65 @-@ hectare ( 160 @-@ acre ) nature reserve situated just below the confluence of the Rivers Avon and Stour . During the 18th century it was notorious for smugglers landing tobacco and rum in the narrow channels of Christchurch Harbour . It contains areas of salt marsh and freshwater marsh with reed beds and is home to grazing horses , rare birds , and 14 species of rare or endangered plants . It was designated as a Local Nature Reserve in 1964 and a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1986 . 
 To the north of Christchurch is St. Catherine 's Hill , the highest part of the borough at 53 metres ( 174 ft ) above sea level . This hill is the most southerly of a chain of three hills , some 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) long with 35 @-@ hectare ( 86 @-@ acre ) area of heathland and coniferous forest . The New Forest , Christchurch Priory , Hengistbury Head , Avon Valley , Christchurch Bay , The Solent and The Needles of the Isle of Wight can be seen from viewpoints on the east side of the Hill . Stour Valley way , Poole Bay and the Isle of Purbeck can be viewed from the south west side of the Hill . Due to its commanding views , St. Catherine 's Hill has been in use since prehistoric times as a look @-@ out area and beacon and in more recent years served as a military training ground . The hill is home to protected and rare wildlife species including the Dartford warbler , nightjar , and the sand lizard . 
 The geology of the borough is unremarkable ; the bedrock is mainly composed of sand with patches of clay to the east and west , and superficial deposits ( drift ) of sand and gravel cover the entire area . The extraction of sand and gravel for construction purposes is carried out in the borough and the opening of more sites is planned .

 Christchurch , like the rest of the country , has a temperate climate with a small variation in daily and annual temperatures . The presence of the Gulf Stream ensures that the British Isles maintain an all @-@ year @-@ round ambient temperature , and , because of its position on the south coast of England , Christchurch has slightly warmer winters and cooler summers than settlements further inland . The warmest months in Christchurch are July and August , which have an average temperature range of 12 to 22 ° C ( 54 to 72 ° F ) , and the coolest months are January and February , which have a range of 2 to 8 @.@ 3 ° C ( 35 @.@ 6 to 46 @.@ 9 ° F ) .

 Between 2000 and 2007 the total Gross Value Added ( GVA ) of the borough grew by 37 % from £ 552 million to £ 757 million . The biggest contributor to the local economy through the period 2000 – 2007 was the transport and communication sector which in 2007 brought in £ 145 million GVA ; £ 64 million more than in 2000 . The sector which saw the largest growth during that period however , was metals and engineering which increased by 140 % . The food , textiles and wood industries experienced the largest negative change at − 42 % whereas the electronics industry experienced the biggest fall with £ 16 @.@ 2 million less than seven years previous . 
 An aircraft manufacturing industry was established in the town with the construction of an Airspeed factory at Christchurch Airfield in 1942 . In 1948 the factory became part of de Havilland and manufactured a wide range of aircraft such as the Vampire , Sea Venom and Sea Vixen . In the 1950s , Bournemouth Airport , a former RAF base situated on the outskirts of borough boundaries at Hurn , also became heavily involved in aircraft production after Vickers Armstrong — which later became the British Aircraft Corporation ( BAC ) — established a factory at the airport . 
 Although the de Havilland factory closed down in 1962 and aircraft manufacturing at Bournemouth Airport ceased by the late 1970s , the aircraft and engineering industries remained important to the local economy . The BAC works at Bournemouth Airport were converted into a 80 @-@ hectare ( 200 @-@ acre ) industrial estate which has become one of the largest employment sites in the county with over 140 businesses and a working population of some 2 @,@ 000 people . The town has a number of smaller trading estates including : Airfield Way Industrial Estate , Sea Vixen Trading Estate , Silver Business Park , Hughes Business Park , Priory Park and Somerford Road , all situated on the old Christchurch Airfield ; <unk> / Avon Trading Park , once the old railway yard ; and <unk> Road and Stony Lane . 
 Bournemouth Airport is among the busiest international airports in the country and is an important economic generator for the region . Owned and operated by Manchester Airports Group , the airport handles 800 @,@ 000 passengers annually and supports around 900 full @-@ time equivalent jobs which contribute more than £ 24 million to the local economy . Between 2007 and 2010 the airport underwent a £ 45 million upgrade which included the construction of a new departure terminal . Other major employers in Christchurch include : BAE Systems , Bournemouth Aviation Services Company ( <unk> ) , Beagle Aerospace , Bournemouth International Airport Ltd , Channel Express , College of Air Traffic Control , Data Track Process Instruments , European Aviation , FR Aviation , Honeywell , Reid Steel , <unk> Castor Company , Sainsbury 's , Siemens <unk> and SELEX Communications . 
 The town 's High Street contains 48 shops with 61 @,@ 847 square feet ( 5 @,@ 745 @.@ 8 m2 ) of retail space . The addition of the Saxon Square shopping precinct in 1982 added a further 41 @,@ 748 square feet ( 3 @,@ 878 @.@ 5 m2 ) of shop floor to the town centre — an increase of 67 @.@ 5 % . The combined number of shops and floor space makes Christchurch the fifth largest shopping centre in Dorset . 
 Christchurch attracts some 837 @,@ 000 staying visitors and 792 @,@ 000 day visitors each year and tourism generates £ 76 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 for the local economy . Although important to the local economy with spending generating over £ 53 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 GVA , Christchurch is not so heavily dependent on tourism as some of its neighbours .

 A weekly market was granted to the town by Baldwin de Redvers and the first market took place in 1149 at the junction of Castle Street and High Street . These weekly markets stopped in 1872 but resumed a century later in a car park next to the town hall , now the site of Saxon Square . When construction of the square began in 1983 , the market was moved to a car park in Bank Close . Today it is held every Monday in High Street which is then closed to traffic . Periodically there are food fairs and a French market in the town . 
 Every year since 2000 the town has held a food and wine festival during May . It includes an international food market with over 100 stalls selling food and drink , and a large marquee with a kitchen area erected in Saxon Square . Here cooking demonstrations are given , sometimes by a celebrity chef : past guests have included Gary Rhodes and Jean @-@ Christophe <unk> . The week @-@ long festival is a community event which aims to educate people in healthy eating as well as the availability of foods . During the festival local chefs are invited into schools to demonstrate recipes ; and throughout the weekend the marquee hosts a cookery workshop for 7 – 10 @-@ year olds . 
 Christchurch holds an annual music festival on the first weekend in July . Originally a folk festival , the event has evolved to cater for a wider variety of tastes : clog and morris dancing groups and salsa and belly dancing exhibitions have featured . Rock bands and soul groups have been included alongside the more traditional types of music . The festival 's format changes annually but usually focuses around the town quay where a large marquee contains the main stage . Local bars often host smaller bands and dancing and exhibitions take place throughout the town centre . 
 Another annual event is the regatta which has been held every year since 1909 . It takes place around the second week in August and involves rowing competitions on the River Stour and a travelling funfair sited on the adjacent town quay . A carnival procession and large firework display takes place at the weekend . The part of the quay by the priory is known as The Quomps and was conveyed to the town in 1911 by Lord Malmesbury . A 19th @-@ century bandstand situated in the Quomps was an anonymous gift to the town in 1938 . During the summer months it is used for free open @-@ air concerts on Saturdays , one of the most popular being " Stompin ' on the Quomps " , a smooth jazz festival . On Sunday afternoons brass bands often play there . 
 The town has a museum : The Red House Museum in Quay Road . Once the town 's workhouse , the Red House contains permanent and temporary exhibitions pertaining to local history , costume , geology , natural history and archaeology . The museum grounds contain formal and informal gardens . The old power station in Bargates , owned by Scottish and Southern Energy , housed the Museum of Electricity . This is no longer open to the public , although the company is working on new ways to share the museum 's collection more widely across the UK .

 Christchurch 's town centre encompasses a mixture of traditional public houses , restaurants , coffee shops , antiquated cottages and historic listed buildings . The older part of the town dates from Saxon times and retains its Saxon street layout . The Grade II listed Mayor 's Parlour was built as the market hall in 1745 at the far end of the High Street but was moved to its present position in 1849 . It was enclosed and extended , and used as the town hall until the civic offices were built in the mid @-@ 1970s . It was restored to its former condition circa 1982 when the Saxon Square shopping precinct was built . 
 High Street contains two Grade II listed public houses : Ye Olde George Inne , once a coach house , and the Ship Inn which has the oldest licence in Christchurch . A known haunt of smugglers , the Ship Inn 's history can be traced back to 1688 . At the end of High Street is Church Street which contains Church Hatch , a Grade II * listed Georgian residence . Once the home of Sir Owen Tudor Burne , it was saved from demolition in 1929 by public appeal . Ye Olde Eight Bells , a Grade II listed gift shop in Church Street , was once another alehouse frequented by smugglers and central to a number of local legends . Close by in Castle Street is the <unk> , a 14th @-@ century thatched property often referred to as the old courthouse ; although some local historians maintain that this was next door and long gone . 
 The town centre contains three Grade I listed bridges . The Town Bridge is a 15th @-@ century ashlar stone bridge composed of two portions separated by a narrow strip of land . The eastern portion crosses the narrower of two branches of the River Avon that pass through the town and features five low round @-@ headed arches . The western bridge features two arches and crosses the millstream which runs adjacent to the Avon . To the east of the Town Bridge on the same route from the town centre the Waterloo Bridge spans the larger branch of the Avon . Built circa 1816 – 1817 in the mediaeval tradition with dressed Portland stone , its design incorporates five wide segmental arches , circular piers and capped cutwaters . On the northern side of the bridge a modern steel pedestrian footbridge is cantilevered to the older structure . 
 = = = Castle = = = 
 The Grade I listed Christchurch Castle is of Norman origin and was originally of a motte and bailey construction . The castle once dominated the town but now lies in ruins and only a couple of the keep walls remain . A castle has stood in Christchurch since approximately 924 AD when Edward the Elder fortified the town with a wooden fort on a motte . After the Norman conquest in 1066 the castle 's defences were strengthened with a ditch and bailey surrounded by a wooden palisade . The wooden fort was replaced ; at first with another wooden structure and then a stone keep which was constructed in the 12th century . Within the curtain wall of the castle stands the Constable 's House , a Grade I listed Norman dwelling . Much of the building 's stonework remains , including a rare example of a Norman chimney ( one of only five in the country ) and the privy which extends out across the mill stream . The castle was slighted by the Parliamentary army during the English Civil War to prevent the stronghold from falling into Royalist hands . 
 = = = Priory = = = 
 Christchurch town centre and the Harbour are overlooked by the 11th century Grade I listed Christchurch Priory . Once a monastery , it was given to the town for use as a parish church by Henry VIII after the dissolution in 1540 . It is the longest parish church in England with a nave over 311 feet ( 95 m ) long . The nave and transepts are Norman with heavy columns and round arches , whereas the lady chapel is from the 14th century and more Perpendicular in style . The great choir is even later , having been rebuilt in the 16th century . The Priory is noted for its Miraculous Beam , which attracts pilgrims from all over the world . Within the Priory grounds stands Priory House , a Grade II listed mansion built in 1777 by Gustavus Brander . The Priory is in active use for worship and forms part of the Church of England Diocese of Winchester .

 Place Mill is a Grade II * listed Anglo @-@ Saxon watermill located a short distance to the south of the Priory on Christchurch Quay . It is mentioned in the Domesday Book and features a mediaeval stone base underneath red brickwork . The mill belonged to the Priory but stopped working in 1908 and stood derelict until purchased by the council and restored in 1981 . It is unique in that it takes water from one river ( the Avon ) and spills it into a second river ( the Stour ) . A millstream is supplied from the Royalty Fisheries near to the Electricity Museum behind Bargates , and flows for nearly 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) to the mill between the Avon and the Priory grounds before joining the River Stour . A mediaeval Grade II listed bridge known as the Place Mill Bridge crosses the millstream nearby .

 Situated on the cliffs at Highcliffe is Highcliffe Castle , a Grade I listed mansion . The building was designed by William Donthorne for Charles Stuart , 1st Baron Stuart de Rothesay , and built between 1831 and 1835 . It stands on the site of " High Cliff " , a demolished Georgian mansion which belonged to Charles Stuart 's grandfather John Stuart , 3rd Earl of Bute . An important remaining example of the Gothic Revival architecture , <unk> 's design incorporated French mediaeval stonework , stained glass and 18th @-@ century French panelling . The house was sold in 1950 and was briefly used as a children 's home and a Catholic seminary . After a devastating fire and years of neglect the castle was sold to Christchurch Borough Council in 1977 and underwent restoration . Highcliffe Castle is open to the general public throughout the year and is used for weddings , private functions , exhibitions and other public events .

 The town 's football team , Christchurch F.C. , play at Hurn Bridge Sports Club situated at the junction of the Avon Causeway and <unk> Lane . Established in 1885 the club was a founding member of the Hampshire Football Association in 1887 . Christchurch F.C. were promoted as champions to Hampshire League One in 1938 , 1948 and 1986 , and in 1970 , became the first team to win the Bournemouth Senior Cup three times in succession . The club joined the Wessex League ( the ninth tier of the English football league system ) in 1988 and are one of the few clubs in the league that maintain amateur status . 
 Hurn Bridge is also the home of Christchurch Cricket Club who have teams in the Saturday and Sunday Dorset Leagues . In 2009 the first XI won Division 3 having been newly promoted from Division 4 . In those two seasons the team lost only four games . Hurn Bridge houses the Dorset Cricket Centre , an indoor training facility run by the Dorset Cricket Board . 
 Christchurch has a council run leisure centre situated at the end of Stony Lane South . The complex contains a swimming pool , golf course and indoor bowling facility which is home to the East Dorset Indoor Bowls Club . Christchurch has a lawn bowling club , Christchurch Bowling Club , that play on the green adjacent to the castle ruins . The town has two other lawn bowling clubs and golf courses ; at Iford and Highcliffe . 
 Sailing is a popular leisure pursuit in Christchurch and the harbour is home to three sailing clubs : Highcliffe Sailing Club , Mudeford Sailing Club and Christchurch Sailing Club which are situated at Mudeford Quay , Fisherman 's Bank and the Town Quay respectively .

 = Polonium = 
 Polonium is a chemical element with symbol Po and atomic number 84 . A rare and highly radioactive metal with no stable isotopes , polonium is chemically similar to selenium and tellurium , though it also shows resemblances to its horizontal neighbors thallium , lead , and bismuth due to its metallic character . Due to the short half @-@ life of all its isotopes , its natural occurrence is limited to tiny traces of the fleeting polonium @-@ 210 in uranium ores , as it is the penultimate daughter of natural uranium @-@ 238 : it has a half @-@ life of 138 days . Though slightly longer @-@ lived isotopes exist , they are much more difficult to produce . Today , polonium is more often produced in milligram quantities by the neutron irradiation of bismuth . Due to its intense radioactivity , that results in radiolysis of chemical bonds and immense radioactive self @-@ heating , its chemistry has mostly been investigated on the trace scale only . 
 Polonium was discovered in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie , when it was chemically separated out of uranium ore and identified solely by its strong radioactivity : it was the first element to be so discovered . It was named after Marie Curie 's homeland of Poland . Applications of polonium are sparse and dependent on its radioactivity : they include heaters in space probes , antistatic devices , and sources of neutrons and alpha particles . Its intense radioactivity makes it dangerously toxic to life . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Polonium has 33 known isotopes , all of which are radioactive . They have atomic masses that range from 188 to 220 u . 210Po ( half @-@ life 138 @.@ 376 days ) is the most widely available . The longer @-@ lived <unk> ( half @-@ life 125 @.@ 2 ± 3 @.@ 3 years , longest @-@ lived of all polonium isotopes ) and <unk> ( half @-@ life 2 @.@ 9 years ) can be made through the alpha , proton , or deuteron bombardment of lead or bismuth in a cyclotron . 
 210Po is an alpha emitter that has a half @-@ life of 138 @.@ 4 days ; it decays directly to its stable daughter isotope , <unk> . A milligram ( 5 curies ) of 210Po emits about as many alpha particles per second as 5 grams of 226Ra . A few curies ( 1 curie equals 37 <unk> , 1 Ci = 37 GBq ) of 210Po emit a blue glow which is caused by ionisation of the surrounding air . 
 About one in 100 @,@ 000 alpha emissions causes an excitation in the nucleus which then results in the emission of a gamma ray with a maximum energy of 803 keV . 
 = = = Solid state form = = = 
 Polonium is a radioactive element that exists in two metallic allotropes . The alpha form is the only known example of a simple cubic crystal structure in a single atom basis , with an edge length of 335 @.@ 2 picometers ; the beta form is rhombohedral . The structure of polonium has been characterized by X @-@ ray diffraction and electron diffraction . 
 210Po ( in common with 238Pu ) has the ability to become airborne with ease : if a sample is heated in air to 55 ° C ( 131 ° F ) , 50 % of it is vaporized in 45 hours to form diatomic Po2 molecules , even though the melting point of polonium is 254 ° C ( 489 ° F ) and its boiling point is 962 ° C ( 1 @,@ 764 ° F ) . More than one hypothesis exists for how polonium does this ; one suggestion is that small clusters of polonium atoms are spalled off by the alpha decay . 
 = = = Chemistry = = = 
 The chemistry of polonium is similar to that of tellurium , although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor bismuth due to its metallic character . Polonium dissolves readily in dilute acids , but is only slightly soluble in alkalis . Polonium solutions are first colored in pink by the Po2 + ions , but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po2 + into <unk> + . This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by glassware due to the absorbed alpha particles ; as a result , polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed . 
 = = = = Compounds = = = = 
 Polonium has no common compounds , and almost all of its compounds are synthetically created ; more than 50 of those are known . The most stable class of polonium compounds are polonides , which are prepared by direct reaction of two elements . <unk> has the <unk> structure , the polonides of Ca , Ba , Hg , Pb and lanthanides form a NaCl lattice , <unk> and <unk> have the wurtzite and <unk> the nickel arsenide structure . Most polonides decompose upon heating to about 600 ° C , except for <unk> that decomposes at ~ 300 ° C and the lanthanide polonides , which do not decompose but melt at temperatures above 1000 ° C. For example , <unk> melts at 1250 ° C and <unk> at 2200 ° C. <unk> is one of the very few naturally occurring polonium compounds , as polonium alpha decays to form lead . 
 Polonium hydride ( <unk> 
 2 ) is a volatile liquid at room temperature prone to dissociation ; it is thermally unstable . The two oxides <unk> and <unk> are the products of oxidation of polonium . 
 Halides of the structure <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are known . They are soluble in the corresponding hydrogen halides , i.e. , <unk> in HCl , <unk> in HBr and <unk> in HI . Polonium dihalides are formed by direct reaction of the elements or by reduction of <unk> with SO2 and with <unk> with H2S at room temperature . <unk> can be obtained by reacting polonium dioxide with HCl , HBr or HI . 
 Other polonium compounds include potassium <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> , acetate , bromate , carbonate , citrate , chromate , cyanide , formate , ( II ) and ( IV ) hydroxides , nitrate , selenate , selenite , monosulfide , sulfate , <unk> and sulfite . 
 = = History = = 
 Also tentatively called " radium F " , polonium was discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898 , and was named after Marie Curie 's native land of Poland ( Latin : Polonia ) . Poland at the time was under Russian , German , and Austro @-@ Hungarian partition , and did not exist as an independent country . It was Curie 's hope that naming the element after her native land would publicize its lack of independence . Polonium may be the first element named to highlight a political controversy . 
 This element was the first one discovered by the Curies while they were investigating the cause of pitchblende radioactivity . Pitchblende , after removal of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium , was more radioactive than the uranium and thorium combined . This spurred the Curies to search for additional radioactive elements . They first separated out polonium from pitchblende in July 1898 , and five months later , also isolated radium . 
 In the United States , polonium was produced as part of the Manhattan Project 's Dayton Project during World War II . It was a critical part of the implosion @-@ type nuclear weapon design used in the Fat Man bomb on Nagasaki in 1945 . Polonium and beryllium were the key ingredients of the ' urchin ' detonator at the center of the bomb 's spherical plutonium pit . The urchin ignited the nuclear chain reaction at the moment of prompt @-@ criticality to ensure the bomb did not fizzle . 
 Much of the basic physics of polonium was classified until after the war . The fact that it was used as an initiator was classified until the 1960s . 
 The Atomic Energy Commission and the Manhattan Project funded human experiments using polonium on five people at the University of Rochester between 1943 and 1947 . The people were administered between 9 and 22 microcuries ( 330 and 810 kBq ) of polonium to study its excretion . 
 = = Occurrence and production = = 
 Polonium is a very rare element in nature because of the short half @-@ life of all its isotopes . 210Po , 214Po , and 218Po appear in the decay chain of 238U ; thus polonium can be found in uranium ores at about 0 @.@ 1 mg per metric ton ( 1 part in 1010 ) , which is approximately 0 @.@ 2 % of the abundance of radium . The amounts in the Earth 's crust are not harmful . Polonium has been found in tobacco smoke from tobacco leaves grown with phosphate fertilizers . 
 Because it is present in such small concentrations , isolation of polonium from natural sources is a very tedious process . The largest batch of the element ever extracted , performed in the first half of the 20th century , contained only 40 Ci ( 1 @.@ 5 TBq ) ( 9 mg ) of polonium @-@ 210 and was obtained by processing 37 tonnes of residues from radium production . Polonium is now obtained by irradiating bismuth with high @-@ energy neutrons or protons . 
 In 1934 , an experiment showed that when natural 209Bi is bombarded with neutrons , 210Bi is created , which then decays to 210Po via beta @-@ minus decay . The final purification is done <unk> followed by liquid @-@ liquid extraction techniques . Polonium may now be made in milligram amounts in this procedure which uses high neutron fluxes found in nuclear reactors . Only about 100 grams are produced each year , practically all of it in Russia , making polonium exceedingly rare . 
 This process can cause problems in lead @-@ bismuth based liquid metal cooled nuclear reactors such as those used in the Soviet Navy 's K @-@ 27 . Measures must be taken in these reactors to deal with the unwanted possibility of 210Po being released from the coolant . 
 The longer @-@ lived isotopes of polonium , <unk> and <unk> , can be formed by proton or deuteron bombardment of bismuth using a cyclotron . Other more proton @-@ rich and more unstable isotopes can be formed by the irradiation of platinum with carbon nuclei . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Polonium @-@ based sources of alpha particles were produced in the former Soviet Union . Such sources were applied for measuring the thickness of industrial coatings via attenuation of alpha radiation . 
 Because of intense alpha radiation , a one @-@ gram sample of 210Po will spontaneously heat up to above 500 ° C ( 932 ° F ) generating about 140 watts of power . Therefore , 210Po is used as an atomic heat source to power radioisotope thermoelectric generators via thermoelectric materials . For instance , 210Po heat sources were used in the Lunokhod 1 ( 1970 ) and Lunokhod 2 ( 1973 ) Moon rovers to keep their internal components warm during the lunar nights , as well as the Kosmos 84 and 90 satellites ( 1965 ) . 
 The alpha particles emitted by polonium can be converted to neutrons using beryllium oxide , at a rate of 93 neutrons per million alpha particles . Thus Po @-@ BeO mixtures or alloys are used as a neutron source , for example in a neutron trigger or initiator for nuclear weapons and for inspections of oil wells . About 1500 sources of this type , with an individual activity of 1 @,@ 850 Ci ( 68 TBq ) , have been used annually in the Soviet Union . 
 Polonium was also part of brushes or more complex tools that eliminate static charges in photographic plates , textile mills , paper rolls , sheet plastics , and on substrates ( such as automotive ) prior to the application of coatings . Alpha particles emitted by polonium ionize air molecules that neutralize charges on the nearby surfaces . Some anti @-@ static brushes contain up to 500 microcuries ( 20 MBq ) of 210Po as a source of charged particles for neutralizing static electricity . In USA , the devices with no more than 500 µCi ( 19 MBq ) of ( sealed ) 210Po per unit can be bought in any amount under a " general license " , which means that a buyer need not be registered by any authorities . Polonium needs to be replaced in these devices nearly every year because of its short half @-@ life ; it is also highly radioactive and therefore has been mostly replaced by less dangerous beta particle sources . 
 Tiny amounts of 210Po are sometimes used in the laboratory and for teaching purposes — typically of the order of 4 – 40 kBq ( 0 @.@ 11 – 1 @.@ 08 µCi ) , in the form of sealed sources , with the polonium deposited on a substrate or in a resin or polymer matrix — are often exempt from licensing by the NRC and similar authorities as they are not considered hazardous . Small amounts of 210Po are manufactured for sale to the public in the United States as ' needle sources ' for laboratory experimentation , and are retailed by scientific supply companies . The polonium is a layer of plating which in turn is plated with a material such as gold , which allows the alpha radiation ( used in experiments such as cloud chambers ) to pass while preventing the polonium from being released and presenting a toxic hazard . According to United Nuclear , they typically sell between four and eight such sources per year . 
 = = Biology and toxicity = = 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 Polonium is highly dangerous and has no biological role . By mass , polonium @-@ 210 is around 250 @,@ 000 times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide ( the LD50 for 210Po is less than 1 microgram for an average adult ( see below ) compared with about 250 milligrams for hydrogen cyanide ) . The main hazard is its intense radioactivity ( as an alpha emitter ) , which makes it very difficult to handle safely . Even in microgram amounts , handling 210Po is extremely dangerous , requiring specialized equipment ( a negative pressure alpha glove box equipped with high performance filters ) , adequate monitoring , and strict handling procedures to avoid any contamination . Alpha particles emitted by polonium will damage organic tissue easily if polonium is ingested , inhaled , or absorbed , although they do not penetrate the epidermis and hence are not hazardous as long as the alpha particles remain outside the body . Wearing chemically resistant and intact gloves is a mandatory precaution to avoid transcutaneous diffusion of polonium directly through the skin . Polonium delivered in concentrated nitric acid can easily diffuse through inadequate gloves ( e.g. , latex gloves ) or the acid may damage the gloves . 
 It has been reported that some microbes can <unk> polonium by the action of <unk> . This is similar to the way in which mercury , selenium and tellurium are methylated in living things to create organometallic compounds . Studies investigating the metabolism of polonium @-@ 210 in rats have shown that only 0 @.@ 002 to 0 @.@ 009 % of polonium @-@ 210 ingested is excreted as volatile polonium @-@ 210 . 
 = = = Acute effects = = = 
 The median lethal dose ( LD50 ) for acute radiation exposure is generally about 4 @.@ 5 Sv . The committed effective dose equivalent 210Po is 0 @.@ 51 µSv / Bq if ingested , and 2 @.@ 5 µSv / Bq if inhaled . So a fatal 4 @.@ 5 Sv dose can be caused by ingesting 8 @.@ 8 MBq ( 240 µCi ) , about 50 nanograms ( ng ) , or inhaling 1 @.@ 8 MBq ( 49 µCi ) , about 10 ng . One gram of 210Po could thus in theory poison 20 million people of whom 10 million would die . The actual toxicity of 210Po is lower than these estimates , because radiation exposure that is spread out over several weeks ( the biological half @-@ life of polonium in humans is 30 to 50 days ) is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose . It has been estimated that a median lethal dose of 210Po is 15 <unk> ( 0 @.@ 41 mCi ) , or 0 @.@ 089 micrograms , still an extremely small amount . For comparison , one grain of table salt is about 0 @.@ 06 mg = 60 μg . [ 1 ] 
 = = = Long term ( chronic ) effects = = = 
 In addition to the acute effects , radiation exposure ( both internal and external ) carries a long @-@ term risk of death from cancer of 5 – 10 % per Sv .

 The maximum allowable body burden for ingested 210Po is only 1 @.@ 1 kBq ( 30 nCi ) , which is equivalent to a particle massing only 6 @.@ 8 picograms . The maximum permissible workplace concentration of airborne 210Po is about 10 Bq / m3 ( 3 × 10 − 10 µCi / cm3 ) . The target organs for polonium in humans are the spleen and liver . As the spleen ( 150 g ) and the liver ( 1 @.@ 3 to 3 kg ) are much smaller than the rest of the body , if the polonium is concentrated in these vital organs , it is a greater threat to life than the dose which would be suffered ( on average ) by the whole body if it were spread evenly throughout the body , in the same way as caesium or tritium ( as <unk> ) . 
 210Po is widely used in industry , and readily available with little regulation or restriction . In the US , a tracking system run by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was implemented in 2007 to register purchases of more than 16 curies ( 590 GBq ) of polonium @-@ 210 ( enough to make up 5 @,@ 000 lethal doses ) . The IAEA " is said to be considering tighter regulations ... There is talk that it might tighten the polonium reporting requirement by a factor of 10 , to 1 @.@ 6 curies ( 59 GBq ) . " As of 2013 , this is still the only alpha emitting byproduct material available , as a NRC <unk> Quantity , which may be held without a radioactive material license . 
 Polonium and its compounds must be handled in a glove box , which is further enclosed in another box , maintained at a slightly higher pressure than the glove box to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out . Gloves made of natural rubber do not provide sufficient protection against the radiation from polonium ; surgical gloves are necessary . <unk> gloves shield radiation from polonium better than natural rubber .

 Polonium was administered to humans for experimental purposes from 1943 to 1947 ; it was injected into four hospitalised patients , and orally given to a fifth . Studies such as this were funded by the Manhattan Project and the AEC , and conducted at the University of Rochester . The objective was to obtain data on human excretion of polonium to correlate with more extensive data from rats . Patients selected as subjects were chosen because experimenters wanted persons who had not been exposed to polonium either through work or accident . All subjects had incurable diseases . Excretion of polonium was followed , and an autopsy was conducted at that time on the deceased patient to determine which organs absorbed the polonium . Patients ' ages ranged from ' early thirties ' to ' early forties . ' The experiments were described in Chapter 3 of Biological Studies with Polonium , Radium , and Plutonium , National Nuclear Energy Series , Volume VI @-@ 3 , McGraw @-@ Hill , New York , 1950 . Not specified is the isotope under study , but at the time polonium @-@ 210 was the most readily available polonium isotope . The DoE <unk> submitted for this experiment reported no follow up on these subjects . 
 It has also been suggested that Irène Joliot @-@ Curie was the first person to die from the radiation effects of polonium . She was accidentally exposed to polonium in 1946 when a sealed capsule of the element exploded on her laboratory bench . In 1956 , she died from leukemia . 
 According to the 2008 book The Bomb in the Basement , several deaths in Israel during 1957 – 1969 were caused by 210Po . A leak was discovered at a Weizmann Institute laboratory in 1957 . Traces of 210Po were found on the hands of professor Dror <unk> , a physicist who researched radioactive materials . Medical tests indicated no harm , but the tests did not include bone marrow . <unk> died from cancer . One of his students died of leukemia , and two colleagues died after a few years , both from cancer . The issue was investigated secretly , and there was never any formal admission that a connection between the leak and the deaths had existed .

 The cause of death in the 2006 murder of the Russian KGB agent who defected to the British MI6 intelligence agency , Alexander Litvinenko was determined to be 210Po poisoning . According to Prof. Nick Priest of Middlesex University , an environmental toxicologist and radiation expert , speaking on Sky News on December 3 , 2006 , Litvinenko was probably the first person to die of the acute α @-@ radiation effects of 210Po . 
 Abnormally high concentrations of 210Po were detected in July 2012 in clothes and personal belongings of the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat , a heavy smoker , who died on 11 November 2004 of uncertain causes . The spokesman for the Institut de <unk> in Lausanne , Switzerland , where those items were analyzed , stressed that the " clinical symptoms described in Arafat 's medical reports were not consistent with polonium @-@ 210 and that conclusions could not be drawn as to whether the Palestinian leader was poisoned or not " , and that " the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume Arafat 's body to test it for polonium @-@ 210 . " On 27 November 2012 Arafat 's body was exhumed and samples were taken for separate analysis by experts from France , Switzerland and Russia . On 12 October 2013 , The Lancet published the group 's finding that high levels of the element were found in Arafat 's blood , urine , and in saliva stains on his clothes and toothbrush . The French tests later found some polonium but stated it was from " natural environmental origin . " Following later Russian tests , Vladimir <unk> , the head of the Russian Federal Medical and Biological Agency , stated in December 2013 that Arafat died of natural causes , and they had no plans to conduct further tests .

 It has been suggested that chelation agents such as British Anti @-@ Lewisite ( dimercaprol ) can be used to decontaminate humans . In one experiment , rats were given a fatal dose of 1 @.@ 45 MBq / kg ( 8 @.@ 7 ng / kg ) of 210Po ; all untreated rats were dead after 44 days , but 90 % of the rats treated with the chelation agent <unk> remained alive after 5 months . 
 = = = Detection in biological specimens = = = 
 Polonium @-@ 210 may be quantified in biological specimens by alpha particle spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation . The baseline urinary excretion of polonium @-@ 210 in healthy persons due to routine exposure to environmental sources is normally in a range of 5 – 15 mBq / day . Levels in excess of 30 mBq / day are suggestive of excessive exposure to the radionuclide . 
 = = = Occurrence in humans and the biosphere = = = 
 Polonium @-@ 210 is widespread in the biosphere , including in human tissues , because of its position in the uranium @-@ 238 decay chain . Natural uranium @-@ 238 in the Earth 's crust decays through a series of solid radioactive intermediates including radium @-@ 226 to the radioactive gas radon @-@ 222 , some of which , during its 3 @.@ 8 @-@ day half @-@ life , diffuses into the atmosphere . There it decays through several more steps to polonium @-@ 210 , much of which , during its 138 @-@ day half @-@ life , is washed back down to the Earth 's surface , thus entering the biosphere , before finally decaying to stable lead @-@ 206 . 
 As early as the 1920s Antoine <unk> , using polonium provided by his colleague Marie Curie , showed that the element has a very specific pattern of uptake in rabbit tissues , with high concentrations particularly in liver , kidney and testes . More recent evidence suggests that this behavior results from polonium substituting for sulfur in sulfur @-@ containing amino @-@ acids or related molecules and that similar patterns of distribution occur in human tissues . Polonium is indeed an element naturally present in all humans , contributing appreciably to natural background dose , with wide geographical and cultural variations , and particularly high levels in arctic residents , for example .

 Polonium @-@ 210 in tobacco contributes to many of the cases of lung cancer worldwide .

 The presence of polonium in tobacco smoke has been known since the early 1960s . Some of the world 's biggest tobacco firms researched ways to remove the substance — to no avail — over a 40 @-@ year period . The results were never published .

 = United States presidential election , 1880 = 
 The United States presidential election of 1880 was a contest between Republican James A. Garfield and Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock in which the Republican Garfield prevailed . It was the 24th quadrennial presidential election , held on Tuesday , November 2 , 1880 . The voter turnout rate was one of the highest in the nation 's history . In the end , the popular vote totals of the two main candidates were separated by fewer than 2 @,@ 000 votes , the smallest victory in the popular vote ever recorded . In the electoral college , however , Garfield 's victory was decisive ; he won nearly all of the populous Northern states to achieve a majority of 214 electoral votes to 155 for Hancock . Hancock 's sweep of the Southern states was not enough for victory , but it cemented his party 's dominance of the region for generations . 
 Incumbent president Rutherford B. Hayes did not seek re @-@ election , keeping a promise made during the 1876 campaign . After the longest convention in the party 's history , the divided Republicans chose Garfield as their standard @-@ bearer , another Ohioan who had earlier served as a Congressman and Civil War general . The Democratic Party selected Pennsylvania @-@ born Civil War general and career army officer Winfield Scott Hancock as their nominee . The dominance of the two major parties began to fray as an upstart left @-@ wing party , the Greenback Party , nominated another Civil War general for president , Iowa Congressman James B. Weaver . In a campaign fought mainly over issues of Civil War loyalties , tariffs , and Chinese immigration , Garfield and Hancock each took just over 48 percent of the popular vote . Weaver and two other minor candidates , Neal Dow and John W. Phelps , together made up the remaining percentage . 
 The election of 1880 was the sixth consecutive presidential election won by the Republicans , a record equaled in American history only by the Democratic @-@ Republican Party during the period 1800 @-@ 1820 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Since before the Civil War , the two major parties were the Republicans and the Democrats , and after the end of the Reconstruction Era in 1877 , the national electorate was closely divided between them . Party membership was only partly based on ideology ; party identification often reflected ethnic and religious background , as well as Civil War loyalties that were still keenly felt by many voters . Most Northern Protestants voted Republican , as did black Southerners . On the other hand , white Southerners and Northern Catholics generally voted Democratic . 
 Tariff reform and the gold standard also divided the country and the major parties . The monetary debate was over the basis for the value of the United States dollar . Nothing but gold and silver coin had ever been legal tender in the United States until the Civil War , when the mounting costs of the war forced the United States Congress to issue " greenbacks " ( dollar bills backed by government bonds ) . Greenbacks helped pay for the war , but resulted in the most severe inflation since the American Revolution . After the war , bondholders and other creditors ( especially in the North ) wanted to return to a gold standard . At the same time , debtors ( often in the South and West ) benefited from the way inflation reduced the real value of their debts , and workers and some businessmen liked the way inflation made for easy credit . The issue cut across parties , producing dissension among Republicans and Democrats alike and spawning a third party , the Greenback Party , in 1876 , when both major parties nominated " hard money " candidates ( i.e. , candidates who favored the gold @-@ backed currency instead of " soft money " greenbacks that generated inflation ) . Monetary debate intensified as Congress effectively demonetized silver in 1873 and began redeeming greenbacks in gold by 1879 , while limiting their circulation . As the 1880 election season began , the nation 's money was backed by gold alone , but the issue was far from settled . 
 Tariff policy was a source of conflict in late 19th @-@ century American politics . During the Civil War , Congress raised protective tariffs to new heights . This was done partly to pay for the war , but partly because high tariffs were popular in the North . A high tariff meant that foreign goods were more expensive , which made it easier for American businesses to sell goods domestically . Republicans supported high tariffs as a way to protect American jobs and increase prosperity . Democrats generally condemned them as a source of higher prices for goods , whereas the higher revenues that they generated for the federal government were not needed after the conclusion of the Civil War . Many Northern Democrats supported high tariffs , however , for the same economic reasons that Northern Republican did . In the interest of party unity , they often sought to avoid the question as much as possible . 
 Four years earlier , in the election of 1876 , Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio defeated Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York in one of the most hotly contested presidential elections in the nation 's history . The results initially indicated a Democratic victory , but the electoral votes of several states were disputed until just a few days days before the new president was to be inaugurated . Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan Electoral Commission , which ultimately decided the race for Hayes . 
 For Democrats , the " stolen election " became a rallying cry , and the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives spent much of 1878 investigating it , although they failed to turn up any new evidence against their Republican foes . At first , Tilden was seen as the front @-@ runner for the 1880 nomination . For leading Republicans , Hayes 's inauguration in 1877 signaled the start of backroom maneuverings for the nomination in 1880 . Even before his election , Hayes had pledged not to run for a second term , leaving the path to the White House open in 1880 . His cabinet selections alienated many party leaders , as well , deepening the growing divide within the Republican party between forces loyal to New York Senator Roscoe Conkling and those loyal to Maine Senator James G. Blaine .

 The parties agreed on their respective platforms and nominees at conventions , which met in the summer before the election . 
 = = = Republicans = = = 
 The Republican convention met first , convening in Chicago , Illinois , on June 2 . Of the men vying for the Republican nomination , the three strongest candidates leading up to the convention were former president Ulysses S. Grant , Senator James G. Blaine and Treasury Secretary John Sherman . Grant was the leading military commander for the Northern forces during the Civil War and had served two terms as <unk> from 1869 to 1877 . He was seeking an unprecedented third term in the office . He was backed by Conkling 's faction of the Republican Party , now known as the Stalwarts . They are mainly known for their opposition to the civil service reforms sought by President Hayes . Blaine , a senator and former representative from Maine , was backed by the Half @-@ Breed faction of the party , which did support civil service reform . Sherman , the brother of Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman , was a former Senator from Ohio serving in Hayes 's cabinet . He was backed by a smaller delegation that supported neither of the major factions . 
 On the first ballot , Grant and Blaine gleaned 304 and 285 votes , respectively , while Sherman received 93 . None of the candidates were close to victory , and the balloting continued in order to determine a winner . Many more ballots were taken , but no candidate prevailed . After the thirty @-@ fifth ballot , Blaine and Sherman delegates switched their support to the new " dark horse " candidate , Representative James A. Garfield of Ohio . On the next ballot , Garfield won the nomination when he received 399 votes , most of them former Blaine and Sherman delegates . To placate the Grant faction , Garfield 's Ohio supporters suggested Levi P. Morton for vice president . Morton declined , based on Conkling 's advice . They next offered the nomination to Chester A. Arthur , another New York Stalwart . Conkling also advised him to decline , but he accepted nonetheless . He was nominated , and the longest @-@ ever Republican National Convention was adjourned on June 8 , 1880 . 
 = = = Democrats = = = 
 Later that month , the Democrats held their convention in Cincinnati , Ohio . Six men were officially candidates for nomination at the convention , and several others also received votes . Of these , the two leading candidates were Major General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania and Senator Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware . Tilden was not officially a candidate , but he wielded a heavy influence over the convention . Tilden was ambiguous about his willingness to participate in another campaign , leading some delegates to defect to other candidates , while others stayed loyal to their old standard @-@ bearer . 
 As the convention opened , some delegates favored Bayard , a conservative Senator , while others supported Hancock , a career soldier and Civil War hero . Still others flocked to men they saw as surrogates for Tilden , including Henry B. Payne of Ohio , an attorney and former congressman , and Samuel J. Randall of Pennsylvania , the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives . The first round of balloting was inconclusive , with Hancock and Bayard leading the count . Before the second round , Tilden 's withdrawal from the campaign became known for certain and delegates shifted to Hancock , who was nominated . William Hayden English , a conservative politician and businessman from the swing state of Indiana , was nominated for vice president . 
 = = = Others = = = 
 The Greenback Party convention gathered in Chicago in mid @-@ June , using the hall recently vacated by the Republicans . The party was a newcomer to the political scene in 1880 , having arisen as a response to the economic depression that followed the Panic of 1873 , mostly in the nation 's West and South . During the Civil War , Congress had authorized " greenbacks , " a form of money redeemable in government bonds , rather than in gold , as was traditional . After the war , many Democrats and Republicans in the East sought to return to the gold standard , and the government began to withdraw greenbacks from circulation . The reduction of the money supply , combined with the economic depression , made life harder for debtors , farmers , and industrial laborers ; the Greenback Party hoped to draw support from these groups . Beyond their support for a larger money supply , they also favored an eight @-@ hour work day , safety regulations in factories , and an end to child labor . 
 Six men were candidates for the Greenback nomination . James B. Weaver , an Iowa congressman and Civil War general , was the clear favorite , but two other congressmen , Benjamin F. Butler of Massachusetts and Hendrick B. Wright of Pennsylvania , also commanded considerable followings . Weaver triumphed quickly , winning a majority of the 850 delegates ' votes on the first ballot . Barzillai J. Chambers , a Texas businessman and Confederate veteran , was likewise nominated on the initial vote . More tumultuous was the fight over the platform , as delegates from disparate factions of the left @-@ wing movement clashed over women 's suffrage , Chinese immigration , and the extent to which the government should regulate working conditions . 
 A convention of the Prohibition Party also met that month in Cleveland , Ohio . The Prohibitionists , more of a movement than a party , focused their efforts on banning alcohol . Most party members came from pietist churches , and most were former Republicans . Only twelve states sent delegates to the convention , and the platform they agreed on was silent on most issues of the day , focusing instead on the evils of alcohol . For president , the Prohibitionists nominated Neal Dow , a Civil War general from Maine . As mayor of Portland , Dow helped to pass the " Maine law " , which banned the sale of alcohol in the city ; it became the model for temperance laws around the country . Finally , a revived Anti @-@ Masonic Party nominated John W. Phelps , another Civil War general , on a platform of opposition to Freemasonry . Political prognosticators gave Weaver little chance of victory , and Dow and Phelps none at all .

 James Abram Garfield was raised in humble circumstances on an Ohio farm by his widowed mother . He worked at various jobs , including on a canal boat , in his youth . Beginning at age 17 , he studied at Williams College in Williamstown , Massachusetts , from which he graduated in 1856 . A year later , Garfield entered politics as a Republican . He married Lucretia Rudolph in 1858 , and served as a member of the Ohio State Senate ( 1859 – 1861 ) . Garfield opposed Confederate secession , served as a major general in the Union Army during the Civil War , and fought in the battles of Middle Creek , Shiloh , and Chickamauga . He was first elected to Congress in 1862 to represent Ohio 's 19th District . Throughout Garfield 's extended congressional service after the Civil War , he firmly supported the gold standard and gained a reputation as a skilled orator . Garfield initially agreed with Radical Republican views regarding Reconstruction , but later favored a moderate approach for civil rights enforcement for freedmen . 
 After his nomination , Garfield met with party leaders in an attempt to heal the schism between the Stalwarts and Half @-@ Breeds . In his formal letter to the party accepting his nomination , written with advice from party leaders , he endorsed the ideas of high tariffs and sound money , but drew particular attention to the issues of Chinese immigration and civil service reform . On both , Garfield sought a moderate path . He called for some restrictions on the former , through treaty renegotiation with the Chinese government . He straddled the divide on civil service reform , saying that he agreed with the concept , while promising to make no appointments without consulting party leaders , a position 20th @-@ century biographer Allan Peskin called " inconsistent " . As was traditional at the time , Garfield conducted a " front porch campaign " , returning to his home for the duration of the contest , and leaving the actual campaigning to surrogates . 
 = = = Hancock = = = 
 Winfield Scott Hancock was born and raised in Pennsylvania . He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point and served in the Army for four decades , including service in the Mexican @-@ American War and as a Union general in the Civil War . Known to his Army colleagues as " Hancock the Superb " , he was noted in particular for his personal leadership at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863 , where he led the defense of Pickett 's Charge . His military service continued after the Civil War , as Hancock participated in the military Reconstruction of the South and the Army 's presence at the Western frontier . During Reconstruction , he sided with then @-@ President Andrew Johnson in working for a quick end to military occupation of the South and a return to government by the pre @-@ war establishment . Hancock 's reputation as a war hero at Gettysburg , combined with his status as a prominent Democrat with impeccable Unionist credentials and pro @-@ states ' rights views , made him a quadrennial presidential possibility . 
 Hancock was officially notified of his nomination in July , and responded with the traditional letter of acceptance . As Garfield had , the Democratic nominee sought to cause no controversy in his statement , which according to biographer David M. Jordan was " bland and general " . After scorning the previous years of Republican rule , Hancock sought to tamp down fears that election of a Democrat would overturn the results of the war and Reconstruction , a common Republican campaign theme . Unlike Garfield , Hancock had no record in elected office , but the acceptance letter gave no further indication of his political preferences . Hancock remained on active duty during the campaign at his post on Governors Island in New York Harbor . 
 = = = Weaver = = = 
 James Baird Weaver was born in Ohio , and moved to Iowa as a boy when his family claimed a homestead on the frontier . He became politically active as a young man and was an advocate for farmers and laborers , joining and quitting several political parties in the furtherance of the progressive causes in which he believed . After serving in the Union Army in the Civil War , Weaver returned to Iowa and worked for the election of Republican candidates . After making several unsuccessful attempts at Republican nominations to various offices , and growing dissatisfied with the conservative wing of the party , in 1877 Weaver switched to the Greenback Party , advocating an increased money supply and stricter regulation of big business . As a Greenbacker with Democratic support , Weaver won election to the House of Representatives in 1878 . 
 Unlike the major party candidates , Weaver planned to take the field himself , giving speeches around the country . His running mate , Chambers , was to do the same , until a fall from a train in July disabled him for the duration of the campaign . As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner , he hoped to make inroads in that region . Weaver 's path to victory , already unlikely , was made more difficult by his refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans . His party 's message of racial inclusion also presaged difficulty in the South , as the Greenbackers would face the same obstacles the Republicans did in the face of increasing black disenfranchisement . 
 = = Campaign = = 
 = = = Bloody shirt = = = 
 Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the Solid South , while much of the North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans ; most of the campaign would involve a handful of close states , including New York and a few of the Midwestern states ( national elections in that era were largely decided by closely divided states there ) . Practical differences between the major party candidates were few , and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt : reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war , and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war , dishonor Union veterans , and pay Confederate soldiers ' pensions out of the federal treasury . With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war , and Union generals at the head of all of the major and minor party tickets , the appeal to wartime loyalties was of diminishing value in exciting the voters . 
 The Democrats , for their part , campaigned on the character of the candidates . They attacked Garfield for his connection with the Crédit Mobilier of America scandal of the early 1870s , in which many members of Congress were bribed by the Crédit Mobilier corporation , a railroad construction company . Garfield 's precise involvement was unknown , but modern biographers agree that his account of his dealings with the construction syndicate were less than perfectly honest . Democrats used the incident as a contrast with Hancock who , as a career army officer , stood apart from Congress and lobbyists . Many in the Republican Party were reluctant to directly criticize the " hero of Gettysburg , " but they did characterize Hancock as uninformed on the issues , and some of his former comrades @-@ in @-@ arms gave critical speeches regarding his character . Democrats never made clear what about their victory would improve the nation ; Jordan later characterized their message as simply " our man is better than your man " . 
 The Greenbackers saw the impact of Civil War loyalties more acutely as they vied for Southern votes . Weaver embarked on a speaking tour of the South in July and August . Although the local Greenback parties had seen some recent success , the national party , with an ex @-@ Republican Union general at the head of the ticket , faced more opposition . The party 's courtship of black voters , too , threatened the white Democratic establishment , leading to violent outbursts at Weaver 's rallies and threats against his supporters . As Weaver campaigned in the North in September and October , Republicans accused him of purposely dividing the vote to help Democrats win a plurality in marginal states . Although Weaver refused to cooperate with Democrats in running fusion slates of presidential electors , in state @-@ level races , Greenback candidates did often combine with Democrats to defeat Republican candidates . In the September gubernatorial race in Maine , one such fusion ticket nominated Harris M. <unk> , who narrowly defeated the incumbent Republican in what was thought to be a safe state for that party . The surprise defeat sent a shock through the Garfield campaign , and caused them to rethink their strategy of waving the bloody shirt . 
 = = = Tariffs and immigration = = = 
 After their defeat in Maine , the Republicans began to emphasise policy differences more . One significant difference between them and the Democrats was a purposely vague statement in the Democratic platform endorsing " a tariff for revenue only . " Garfield 's campaigners used this statement to paint the Democrats as unsympathetic to the plight of industrial laborers , a group that benefited from a high protective tariff . The tariff issue cut Democratic support in industrialized Northern states , which were essential in establishing a Democratic majority . Hancock made the situation worse when , attempting to strike a moderate stance , he said " the tariff question is a local question " . While not completely inaccurate — tariff preferences often reflected local concerns — the statement was at odds with the Democrats ' platform and suggested that Hancock did not understand the issue . 
 The change in tactics appeared to be effective , as October state elections in Ohio and Indiana resulted in Republican victories there , discouraging Democrats about their chances the following month . Democratic party leaders had selected English as Hancock 's running mate because of his popularity in Indiana . With their state @-@ level defeat there , some talked of dropping English from the ticket , but he convinced them that the October losses owed more to local issues , and that the Democratic ticket could still carry Indiana , if not Ohio , in November . 
 In the last weeks before the election , the issue of Chinese immigration entered the race . Both major parties ( as well as the Greenbackers ) pledged in their platforms to limit immigration from China , which native @-@ born workers in the Western states believed was depressing their wages . On October 20 , however , a Democratic newspaper published a letter , purportedly from Garfield to a group of businessmen , pledging to keep immigration at the current levels so that industry could keep workers ' wages low . Garfield denounced the letter as a ruse , but not before one hundred thousand copies of the newspaper were mailed to California and Oregon . Once the letter was exposed as a forgery , Garfield biographer Peskin believes it may even have gained votes for the Republican in the East , but it likely weakened him in the West . 
 = = Results = = 
 When all the ballots were counted , fewer than 2 @,@ 000 votes separated Garfield and Hancock , the closest popular vote of any American presidential election before or since . The voters showed their interest in the election by turning out in record numbers ; 78 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot , among largest percentages in American history . Each major party candidate earned just over 48 percent of the vote . Weaver won more than 3 percent , tripling the Greenback total of four years earlier . The other minor party candidates fared far worse , as Dow and Phelps earned 0 @.@ 1 and 0 @.@ 01 percent , respectively . The narrow victory carried over into the Congressional vote , as the Republicans won the House by a twelve @-@ seat margin and the Senate was evenly divided . Garfield carried the crucial state of New York by 20 @,@ 000 votes out of 1 @.@ 1 million cast there . Other states were much closer ; Hancock 's margin of victory in California was only 22 votes . 
 In the electoral college , the vote was more decisive . As expected , Hancock carried the South , but Garfield swept all but one of the Northern states ( the exception , New Jersey , was lost by just two thousand votes ) . Both candidates carried nineteen states , but Garfield 's triumphs in the more populous North translated into a 214 – 155 electoral college victory . The sectional divide of the vote more deeply enforced the Republicans ' retreat from the South after Reconstruction , and demonstrated that they could win without competing there . Weaver 's resistance to fusion had no effect on the result ; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana , but not any other of the states Garfield won , and the result would still have been a Republican majority in the electoral college . Hancock was convinced that the Republicans won New York by fraud . Lacking evidence , and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier , the Democrats did not pursue the matter . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 As Garfield entered office in March 1881 , the Republican party schism that had been patched up for the election tore apart once more . Garfield appointed Blaine to the cabinet , and Conkling 's Stalwart faction became irked at their lack of control over patronage , even in Conkling 's home state of New York . Garfield appointed William H. Robertson , a civil service reform supporter , to the most lucrative government post in New York and refused to withdraw the nomination despite Conkling 's protests ; in response , Conkling and his allies brought all legislative action in the closely divided Senate to a halt . In May , Conkling and fellow New York Senator Thomas C. Platt resigned from the Senate in protest . The two Stalwarts expected the New York legislature to reelect them in triumph ; instead , the legislature deadlocked for months , eventually declining to return either man to the Senate . Before that result was known , however , tragedy struck as Charles Guiteau , a mentally unstable man disappointed at being unable to secure a patronage appointment , shot Garfield on July 2 , 1881 . 
 Garfield lingered for two and a half months before dying on September 19 , 1881 . Vice President Chester A. Arthur , the New York Stalwart , was sworn in as president that night . Garfield 's murder by a spoilsman inspired the nation to reform the civil service and Arthur , erstwhile member of the Conkling machine , joined the cause . In 1883 , a bipartisan majority in Congress passed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act to reform the worst of the office @-@ seeking system , and Arthur signed the measure into law . 
 Congress also settled the issue of Chinese immigration , passing the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 . Arthur initially vetoed a similar measure , which he believed contradicted the United States ' treaty with China , but eventually signed a later compromise bill , which banned immigration from China for ten years . Tariffs , a major issue in the campaign , remained largely unchanged in the four years that followed , although Congress did pass a minor revision that reduced them by an average of less than 2 percent . After a half @-@ hearted attempt at the nomination in 1884 , Arthur retired and died two years later .

 Gutawa was born Aluna Sagita Gutawa – Aluna Sagita meaning " song rhythm " – in Jakarta , Indonesia on 11 August 1993 to Erwin Gutawa , a composer , and <unk> <unk> . The first child of the couple , she enjoyed watching her father work on his compositions . As a result , he enrolled her in a classical piano course , later sending her to a vocal course to develop her soprano voice . She received full support from her father , who assisted her as an adviser .

 In 2004 Gutawa was approached by the manager of ADA Band , who had heard her practising at her singing lessons from the band 's studio next door . She was asked to sing a duet with the band 's lead singer ; Gutawa , although at the time only singing as a hobby , accepted . The duet , titled " Yang <unk> <unk> " ( " The Best for You " ) , was included on ADA Band 's 2005 album Heaven of Love , which sold 800 @,@ 000 copies . After singing other duets with different singers , including religious singer Haddad Alwi , Gutawa was asked to record a solo album by Sony Music Indonesia . 
 After a year in production , Gutawa 's self @-@ titled debut album was released in February 2007 . The album was produced by her father and featured songs written by Glenn Fredly and Melly Goeslaw . Well @-@ received , Gita Gutawa sold 150 @,@ 000 copies in four months and was eventually certified triple platinum . After the success of the album , Gutawa 's previously school @-@ oriented schedule was filled with requests for media appearances and sponsorships . This led to Gutawa 's mother stepping in and serving as her manager , in which role she continued until she became pregnant . Other members of Gutawa 's family then assisted in managing her , with her mother scheduling Gutawa 's media appearances and recording sessions . 
 Gutawa soon began singing in music festivals to gain experience . In 2008 , she won the 6th International Nile Children Song Festival in Cairo with Ria <unk> 's " To Be One " , which she had previously sung on her debut album . That same year she attended a song festival in Italy . She later assembled a girl band to support her after several performances had to be cancelled due to an inability to find musicians at short notice . 
 After her return from Italy , Gutawa began production of her second album , Harmoni Cinta ( Love 's Harmony ) , in June 2008 . She played a larger role in its production than in her debut album , choosing the concepts behind the album as well as the track listing ; she eventually wrote five of the album 's twelve songs . The album was released in May 2009 @.@ selling well . In August of that year , she released her biography , Kota Musik Gita Gutawa ( Gita Gutawa 's Music Box ) . 
 Gutawa followed Harmony Cinta in August 2010 with a third album , the Islamic religious album Balada Shalawat ( Ballads for Salah ) . During recording , Gutawa received coaching from an Islamic scholar , or <unk> , regarding the correct pronunciation of Arabic lyrics used in some songs . The album was launched during Ramadhan , with profits donated to Indonesia 's poor . 
 Gutawa has expressed concern that the public sees her rise to fame as being dependent on her already @-@ famous father ; she has stated in an interview with The Jakarta Post that she learned that " nepotism wouldn 't work in the music industry " . As such , Gutawa has attempted to emphasise that her duet with ADA Band and contract with Sony Music was won entirely on her own merits , with the band 's manager not knowing that she was Erwin Gutawa 's daughter when he approached her . She also cites the " negative sentiments against [ her ] sudden popularity " as pushing her to do her best . 
 In 2011 , Gutawa announced that she would be retiring from music in order to study abroad . As a farewell celebration , her father held the concert " A Masterpiece of Erwin Gutawa " in Jakarta . She announced that she planned to take a degree in economics . On 5 April 2012 , during a visit to Indonesia from her university in England , she performed Chrisye 's song " Baju Pengantin " ( " Wedding Dress " ) in the Kidung Abadi Chrisye concert at Plenary Hall , Jakarta Convention Center . She and her father also wrote a new song for the concert , entitled " Kidung Abadi " ( " Eternal Ballad " ) , which was made by stringing together 246 syllables in Chrisye 's voice .

Gutawa accepted the offer , viewing it as a mainly promotional role . She later starred in its sequel , Ajari Lagi Aku Cinta ( Teach Me More About Love ) . 
 In 2009 , Gutawa voiced a character in Meraih Mimpi ( Chasing Dreams ) , the Indonesian adaptation of Sing to the Dawn ; the voice recording took four months . She later cited it as a good learning experience . The following year , she appeared in her first feature @-@ length film , Love in Perth , in which she played a shy student studying in Perth , Australia . She considered it challenging ; for the most difficult part , a scene in which she had to cry , she practised in front of a mirror . In May 2011 she began dating her Love in Perth costar Derby Romero ; the couple split up sometime before January 2012 .

 While in elementary school and junior high school , she was chosen as the best student for five consecutive years .

She later attended Bina Nusantara Senior High School . In 2009 , Gutawa was chosen by the education @-@ oriented Sampoerna Foundation – run by the investment company Sampoerna Strategic – as its first youth ambassador , taking a direct part in the company 's initiatives .

 = = Background and recording = = 
 The ArchAndroid serves as the follow @-@ up to Janelle Monáe 's debut EP Metropolis : Suite I ( The Chase ) ( 2007 ) and consists of the second and third parts to her Metropolis concept series . Partly inspired by the 1927 film of the same name , the series involves the fictional tale of Cindi Mayweather , a messianic android sent back in time to free the citizens of Metropolis from The Great Divide , a secret society that uses time travel to suppress freedom and love . 
 In an interview for the Chicago Tribune , Monáe said that she was inspired by the quote " The mediator between the hand and the mind is always the heart " for the record . She discussed her incorporation of the android as a metaphor for a minority , whilst being the role of the story 's protagonist also . In an interview for Blues & Soul , Monáe said " she represents the <unk> between the haves and the have @-@ nots , the minority and the majority . So in that way she ’ s very similar to Neo , the Archangel from ' The Matrix ' . And basically her return will mean freedom for the android community " . 
 Monáe has said about the recording sessions " Over the last year and a half when we were recording the ArchAndroid I went through a very transformative period in my life " . Monáe completed the album in Atlanta at the Wondaland Studios and the famous asylum The Palace of the Dogs . Monáe has stated that the album signifies " breaking the chains that enslave minorities of all types " . She has said of recording the album , " Overall , this music came from various corners of the world — from Turkey to Prague to Atlanta — places we were on tour . While recording , we ’ d experiment with different sounds . Once we became engulfed in the sound , we all had an emotional connection to the album . It has definitely transformed my way of thinking , the way that I approach the stage and overall , my life " .

 = = = Musical style = = = 
 Monáe has noted that the album 's musical influences encompass " all the things I love , scores for films like Goldfinger mixed with albums like Stevie Wonder ’ s Music of My Mind and David Bowie ’ s Ziggy Stardust , along with experimental hip hop stuff like Outkast ’ s Stankonia " . Huw Jones of Slant Magazine described her sound as " a unique gray area between neo @-@ soul , funk , and art @-@ rock " . Music writer Greg Kot noted that the album " touches on " musical genres such as funk , hip hop , folk , electro @-@ pop , glam rock , big @-@ band jazz , rock and classical music . Conceptually , Kot described the album as " a self @-@ empowerment manifesto couched inside a futuristic ' emotion @-@ picture ' about an android ’ s battle to overcome oppression . The notion of space travel and ' new worlds ' becomes a metaphor for breaking the chains that enslave minorities of all types – a theme that has a long tradition in African @-@ American music , from Sun Ra and Parliament @-@ Funkadelic to Cannibal Ox and OutKast " . The Atlantic 's <unk> Mock called The ArchAndroid " unique , forward @-@ looking , and apoplectic ... something of a jitterbug between Prince 's 1986 movie Under the Cherry Moon and the 1977 Watts movie Killer of Sheep , and Daughters of the Dust " . Seth Colter Walls of Newsweek described the album as " rocking in parts like Dirty Mind – era Prince , unfolding in a suite form that recalls Abbey Road 's side two , and bumping throughout with the best innovations of contemporary hip @-@ hop " .

One of 2010 's best @-@ reviewed releases , the album received praise for its <unk> concept and Monáe 's eclectic musical range . Michael Cragg of The Guardian found its " sheer musical scope " " spellbinding " . AllMusic writer Andy Kellman praised Monáe 's creativity and called it " an extravagant 70 @-@ minute album involving more imagination , conceptual detail , and stylistic <unk> than most gatefold prog rock epics " . Barry Walters of Spin noted German Expressionism and Afrofuturism as conceptual elements on the album and stated " She 's venturing so far away from soul that she 's come back around to it " . Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot called it " an audacious , sometimes bewildering statement " . Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that " Monáe gets away with most of her metamorphoses , and the sheer ambition is exhilarating even when she stretches too far " . Matthew Cole from Slant Magazine described it as " an elaborately performed and <unk> freaky cyberpunk epic ... so stylistically leftfield in terms of its sound " . The A.V. Club 's Genevieve Koski wrote that " Monáe ’ s inexhaustible swagger and singular style sell both the high @-@ concept theatrics and the schizophrenic sonics " . Pitchfork Media 's Matthew Perpetua called the album " about as bold as mainstream music gets , marrying the world @-@ building possibilities of the concept album to the big tent genre @-@ mutating pop of Michael Jackson and Prince in their prime " . Perpetua elaborated on Monáe 's incorporation of science @-@ fiction and <unk> concepts and the album 's " basic appeal " , stating : 
 Her imagination and iconography deepen the record as an experience and give her license to go far out , but it ultimately serves as a fun , flashy framework for pop songs with universal lyrical sentiments . The first of the two suites mainly deals with identity and self @-@ realization ; the second is essentially a set of love songs . As with all the musical genres blended into The ArchAndroid , Monáe uses the conventions of science fiction as a means of communication , tapping into mythic archetypes for their immediate resonance and power . And where many concept albums run a high risk of being pompous , cryptic , and self @-@ important , Monáe keeps things playful , lively , and accessible . It 's a delicate balancing act [ ... ] resulting in an eccentric breakthrough that transcends its novelty . 
 URB 's Dan Vidal called the album " a spectrum of sound — packed and arranged perfectly into a masterfully composed ( debut ) full @-@ length body of work ... [ a ] genre @-@ defying masterpiece " . Comparing it to singer Janet Jackson 's Rhythm Nation 1814 ( 1989 ) , <unk> Mock of The Atlantic called The ArchAndroid " a smothered funk , though perhaps at times too thick , too inaccessible , but not so much I didn 't want to shake my ass " and viewed it as musically progressive , stating " Monáe has given pop music its first Toni Morrison moment , where fantasy , funk , and the ancestors come together for an experience that evolves one 's soul ... You really don 't know whether you want to diagram it , dance to it , or just be dumbstruck . It owes as much to Parliament @-@ Funkadelic as it does to Samuel R. Delany and Octavia E. Butler . She is finally doing what a number of artists — particularly black artists — have not been able to do in years , and that 's move pop music forward " .

 = Halo : The Flood = 
 Halo : The Flood is a military science fiction novel by William C. Dietz , based on the Halo series of video games and based specifically on the 2001 video game Halo : Combat Evolved , the first game in the series . The book was released in April 2003 and is the second Halo novel . Closely depicting the events of the game , The Flood begins with the escape of a human ship Pillar of Autumn from enemy aliens known as the Covenant . When the Pillar of Autumn unexpectedly discovers a massive artifact known as " Halo " , the humans must square off against the Covenant and a second terrifying force in a desperate attempt to uncover Halo 's secrets and stay alive . Though the book roughly follows the same events of the Xbox game , featuring identical dialogue , Dietz also describes events not seen by the game 's protagonist , the super @-@ soldier Master Chief . 
 After the success of the first Halo novel , Halo : The Fall of Reach , publisher Del Rey and Halo publisher Microsoft signed a deal for new books based on Xbox games , including another entry in the Halo series . Del Ray approached author Dietz to write the next book . Dietz incorporated his first @-@ hand experience in the military for the additional scenes of The Flood not found in the game . 
 Upon release , Halo : The Flood cracked the Publishers Weekly Top Ten Bestsellers List for Paperbacks , but critical reception to the novel was less positive than Eric Nylund 's Fall of Reach or other Halo novels . The repetitive fight scenes and dramatically different characterization of the protagonist compared to Nylund 's work were seen as major flaws , and Dietz 's style of writing was alternatively praised and lambasted . The next Halo novel , Halo : First Strike , would serve to bridge the gap between Combat Evolved and its sequel , Halo 2 . 
 The book was re @-@ released on October 12 , 2010 with new content and editorial corrections . 
 = = Background = = 
 The first Halo book , Halo : The Fall of Reach , sold more than 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 copies and prompted an extended agreement between Del Rey Books and Microsoft to produce more Halo novels . William C. Dietz , a Seattle @-@ based science fiction author , was approached to write the next Halo novel . Though he had never played the game , he immediately bought an Xbox console and a copy of Halo . When he learned that the game was selling rapidly at his local retailer , he agreed to pen the book . 
 Dietz , a former United States Navy Hospital Corpsman , incorporated elements of what he fondly called " The Green Machine " into his work ; despite being in the 26th century , the marines of The Flood are very similar to their modern counterparts . To assist Dietz in writing , Bungie provided what Dietz referred to as " a tremendous " amount of background information on the Halo universe . Once Dietz had finished his draft , Bungie checked it over to make sure it complied with the plot established in the games and novels , as Bungie considers all Halo novels canon . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 Halo : The Flood is set in the year 2552 . Humanity has colonized hundreds of worlds across the galaxy , using faster @-@ than @-@ light drives and cryonic sleep to travel between worlds . Without warning , a collective of alien races known as the Covenant began attacking the outlying colonies , brutally exterminating all life by <unk> the surface of the planets . Humanity , outnumbered and outclassed by the alien 's superior technology , wages a losing war against the enemy . After the human bastion of Reach falls to the Covenant , the human ship Pillar of Autumn jumps into <unk> to lead the Covenant away from Earth . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The novel , like the video game it is based on , begins as the Pillar of Autumn exits slipspace , discovering an unexpected massive ringworld hidden by a moon in orbit around a gas giant . In the system are a host of Covenant , who notice the lone ship . A Covenant leader forbids the fleet to fire on the Autumn , for fear of damaging the ring . Instead , they board and capture the ship . Meanwhile , technicians on the Autumn prepare for battle and awaken a single soldier from cryo sleep — a Spartan known as the Master Chief . 
 The Covenant board the Autumn ; deprived of defensive options , the Autumn 's captain , Jacob Keyes , tells the crew to abandon ship . The Master Chief is entrusted with the artificial intelligence Cortana ; given the wealth of tactical information the A.I. contains , Keyes cannot allow Cortana to fall into enemy hands . The Master Chief leaves for the surface of Halo in a lifeboat ; other soldiers , including a squad of shock troops led by Antonio Silva and his second @-@ in @-@ command , Melissa McKay , land by special drop pods , and take a strategic bluff from the Covenant to use as a base of operations . Captain Keyes is captured by the Covenant , and taken aboard the Covenant cruiser Truth and Reconciliation ; the Master Chief and a squad of Marines board the Truth and Reconciliation , rescuing the captain . Keyes has learned that the ringworld they are on has vast significance to the <unk> they believe that " Halo " , as they call the ring , is a weapon of unimaginable power . Escaping from the Covenant cruiser , Keyes gives the Master Chief the mission of finding the Control Room of Halo before the Covenant . The Master Chief and Cortana discover the location of the Control Room , and with the help of some Marines , insert Cortana into Halo 's computer network . However , Cortana realizes that the ring is not a weapon as they understood at <unk> but before the Chief can press her with questions , Cortana tells the Master Chief to find Captain Keyes . 
 Dropped into the swamp where Keyes and his squad disappeared , the Master Chief discovers that the Captain has been captured and both human and Covenant soldiers have been turned into zombie @-@ like creatures by bulbous aliens . One soldier , Private Wallace Jenkins , is left still semi @-@ conscious and painfully aware of his predicament , unable to control his movement or actions as his former friends and he attack McKay 's troops . Jenkins intends on ending his life , but is instead captured by McKay for study . The Chief is approached by Halo 's resident A.I. , 343 Guilty Spark , who informs the Chief that the creatures he has encountered are called the Flood , a virulent parasite that infects hosts and converts them into either forms for combat , or for reproduction . To activate Halo 's defenses , Guilty Spark needs the Master Chief 's help . In Halo 's Control Room , Guilty Spark gives the Master Chief the key to activate Halo , but is stopped by a furious Cortana . Cortana explains that Halo is a weapon , but it doesn 't kill the <unk> it kills their food , meaning humans , Covenant , and any other sentient life . Realizing that they have to stop Guilty Spark from activating Halo , Cortana and the Master Chief decide to destroy Halo by detonating the crash @-@ landed Pillar of Autumn 's fusion reactors . In order to do this , they need Captain Keyes ' neural implants . Cortana discovers the Captain is still alive , held prisoner once again aboard the Truth and Reconciliation , now in the hands of the Flood who are trying to escape Halo . The Chief fights Covenant and Flood to the Captain , but finds out he is too late — the Captain has been assimilated into the parasite . The Chief retrieves the implants and leaves the Truth for the Autumn . 
 While the Chief and Cortana head to the Autumn , Alpha Base is evacuated . Silva decides to retake the Truth and Reconciliation and pilot the ship away in order to avoid being on Halo when the Autumn blows . The ship is taken successfully , but McKay realizes that Silva is blinded by the thought of promotion and glory to the danger of the Flood ; if even one Flood specimen escaped containment on Earth , the entire planet could fall . Jenkins draws McKay 's attention to a vital energy line on the ship , and realizing that the destruction of the Flood is more important than Silva 's promotion , cuts the cable , sending the Truth and Reconciliation crashing into Halo , killing all aboard . 
 At the Autumn , the Master Chief is forced to destabilize the fusion reactors manually as 343 Guilty Spark and his robotic drones try to stop them . Once the countdown until detonation has begun , Cortana directs the Chief to a fighter still docked in the Pillar of Autumn hangar . Gunning the engines , the Chief and Cortana escape the ring just as the Autumn explodes , ending the threat of the Flood . Cortana scans for survivors and realizes that they are seemingly the only two who have survived . Cortana tells the Master Chief that the fight is finished , to which the Chief replies , " No . The Covenant is still out there , and Earth is at risk . We 're just getting started . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 Reception to the book was mixed . Some reviewers found William C. Dietz 's style of writing subpar when compared to that of Eric Nylund . Dietz 's interpretation of the Master Chief was very different from Nylund 's . Other critics took issue with how the novel did not depart enough from the game 's storyline ; Fans complained about inconsistencies with the other novels and the game itself . 
 Responding to criticism about the book , including his interpretation of the Chief , Dietz replied : 
 ... of [ the book reviews ] that I have read , the negative ones often say something to the effect that the book is just like the game , so why read it ? What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game . That means taking the game and turning it into a book [ ... ] or , put another way , I did what I was hired to do . ... there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character . That 's news to me . All I can tell you is that the Bungie folks , who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue , and approved the book as written . However , there 's no doubt that every author is different , and will approach characters differently . So if Nylund 's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable . 
 Despite the less enthusiastic response The Flood garnered than its predecessor , the book still sold well . Soon after release , The Flood made the Publishers Weekly top ten bestsellers paperback list . The next book in the series , Halo : First Strike , would be written by Eric Nylund and bridge the gap between Halo : Combat Evolved and Halo 2 . 
 = First Battle of Naktong Bulge = 
 The First Battle of Naktong Bulge was an engagement between United States and North Korean forces early in the Korean War from August 5 – 19 , 1950 in the vicinity of Yongsan ( Yeongsan , <unk> county ) and the Naktong River in South Korea . It was a part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously . The battle ended in a victory for the United States after large numbers of US reinforcements destroyed an attacking North Korean division . 
 On August 5 , 4th Infantry Division , North Korean People 's Army ( KPA ) , crossed the Naktong River in the vicinity of Yongsan , attempting to cut US supply lines to the north as well as gaining a bridgehead into the Pusan Perimeter . Opposing it was the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army . Over the next two weeks , American and North Korean forces fought a bloody series of engagements inflicting heavy casualties on one another in a confusing series of attacks and counterattacks , but neither side was able to gain the upper hand . In the end , the US forces , aided by reinforcements , air support and heavy weapons , destroyed the invading North Korean force which was hampered by lack of supply and high desertion rates . 
 The battle was a turning point in the war for North Korean forces , which had seen previous victories owing to superior numbers and equipment . The American forces now had a numerical superiority and more equipment , including tanks and weapons capable of defeating the powerful North Korean T @-@ 34 tanks .

 = = = Outbreak of war = = = 
 Following the 25 June 1950 outbreak of the Korean War after the invasion of the Republic of Korea ( South Korea ) by its northern neighbor , the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( North Korea ) , the United Nations decided to commit troops to the conflict on behalf of South Korea . The United States , a member of the UN , subsequently committed ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and to prevent South Korea from collapsing . However , US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II , five years earlier , and at the time the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division , headquartered in Japan . The division was understrength , and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending . Regardless , the 24th was ordered to South Korea . 
 The 24th Infantry Division was the first US unit sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial " shock " of North Korean advances , delaying much larger North Korean units to buy time to allow reinforcements to arrive . The division was consequently alone for several weeks as it attempted to delay the North Koreans , making time for the 1st Cavalry and the 7th and 25th Infantry Divisions , along with other Eighth Army supporting units , to move into position . Advance elements of the 24th Infantry were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5 , the first encounter between American and North Korean forces . For the first month after the defeat of Task Force Smith , 24th Infantry was repeatedly defeated and forced south by superior North Korean numbers and equipment . The regiments of the 24th Infantry were systematically pushed south in engagements around Chochiwon , Chonan , and Pyongtaek . The 24th made a final stand in the Battle of Taejon , where it was almost completely destroyed but delaying North Korean forces until July 20 . By that time , the Eighth Army 's force of combat troops were roughly equal to North Korean forces attacking the region , with new UN units arriving every day . 
 = = = North Korean advance = = = 
 With Taejon captured , North Korean forces began surrounding the Pusan Perimeter from all sides in an attempt to envelop it . The 4th and 6th North Korean Infantry Divisions advanced south in a wide flanking maneuver . The two divisions attempted to envelop the UN 's left flank , but became extremely spread out in the process . They advanced on UN positions with armor and superior numbers , repeatedly pushing back U.S. and South Korean forces . 
 American forces were pushed back repeatedly before finally halting the North Korean advance in a series of engagements in the southern section of the country . Forces of the 3rd Battalion , 29th Infantry Regiment , newly arrived in the country , were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27 , opening a pass to the Pusan area . Soon after , North Korean forces took Chinju to the west , pushing back the US 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to the Pusan open for more North Korean attacks . US formations were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2 . Suffering mounting losses , the KPA force in the west withdrew for several days to re @-@ equip and receive reinforcements . This granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter . 
 = = = Naktong Bulge = = = 
 About 7 miles ( 11 km ) north of the point where it turns east and is joined by the Nam River , the Naktong River curves westward opposite Yongsan in a wide semicircular loop . For most of this span , the Naktong is around 400 metres ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) wide and 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) deep , allowing infantry to wade across with some difficulty but preventing vehicles from crossing without assistance . This perimeter was defended by a network of observation posts on the high ground , manned by 24th Infantry . Forces in reserve would counterattack any attempted crossings by KPA . Artillery and mortar fire units were also deployed so large amounts of fire could be delivered on any one spot . The division was extremely dispersed . Already understrength , it presented a very thin line . 
 = = Battle = = 
 The 24th US Infantry Division , under the command of Major General John H. Church , occupied a region some 16 miles ( 26 km ) long along the Naktong River . The 34th US Infantry Regiment occupied the southern half , west of Yongsan while the 21st US Infantry Regiment occupied the northern half , west of <unk> . The 19th US Infantry Regiment , meanwhile , was re @-@ equipping in the rear of the lines . In all , the 24th and its supporting units had a strength of 14 @,@ 540 on August 5 . 
 Opposing the 24th Infantry was the 4th North Korean Infantry Division , under the command of Major General Lee Kwon Mu . Both Mu and his division were highly decorated for their exploits so far in the war , particularly during the First Battle of Seoul . By August 4 the 4th Division had concentrated all of its regiments in the vicinity of <unk> 'on . It stood at a strength of about 7 @,@ 000 with 1 @,@ 500 in each infantry regiment . 
 = = = North Korean attack = = = 
 At midnight on the night of August 5 – 6 , 800 North Korean soldiers of the 3rd Battalion , 16th Regiment waded across the river at the Ohang ferry site , 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) south of Pugong @-@ ni and west of Yongsan , carrying light weapons and supplies over their heads or on rafts . A second force attempted to cross further north but was hit with machine gun and artillery fire , falling back in confusion . At 0200 on August 6 , the North Koreans began engaging the forces of 3rd Battalion , 34th Infantry and moved forward after a small fight , attempting to penetrate the lines to Yongsan . North Korean infantry forced 3rd Battalion back , and the American battalion abandoned its command post to consolidate its position . The attack caught the Americans by surprise as US commanders expected the North Koreans to attempt a crossing further north . The landing threatened to split the American lines and disrupt supply lines to positions further north . Subsequently the North Koreans were able to capture a large amount of American equipment . 
 = = = US counterattack = = = 
 The 34th Infantry 's regimental headquarters ordered the 1st Battalion to counterattack the North Koreans . When 1st Battalion arrived at 3rd Battalion 's former command post , it was ambushed by KPA troops on the high ground . C Company , the first to arrive , suffered over fifty percent casualties . A and B Companies counterattacked with tanks and armor , eventually rescuing the beleaguered C Company . At around 20 : 00 , A Company made contact with L Company , 3rd Battalion , still in its positions on the river , radioing that the North Koreans had penetrated eastward north of the Yongsan @-@ Naktong River road to Cloverleaf Hill , but had not yet crossed south of the road to Obong @-@ ni Ridge . The North Koreans had penetrated 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of the Naktong and halfway to Yongsan . 
 Several units of the 34th Regiment began to retreat north and into the 21st Infantry 's lines , but Church ordered them turned around . He also ordered the 19th Infantry to counterattack west along the northern flank of the 34th Infantry to help oppose the KPA . Although the 24th Infantry was repulsed closer to the river , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) inland the 19th Infantry trapped about 300 North Koreans in a village and killed most of them . 
 The 1st Battalion , 34th Infantry , had managed to block the North Korean 's advance to Yongsan while the 19th Infantry was able to push it back and inflict substantial casualties . However , by the evening of August 6 , KPA held firmly on to their bridgehead . Attempted crossings that night were repulsed to the south by South Korean forces , but an unknown number of reinforcements were moved across the river the night of August 6 – 7 . On August 7 – 8 , the North Koreans tried to move two more battalions across the river to the north , but were repulsed by 21st Infantry , which was still in place . The KPA battalions were shifted south to cross at the bridgehead , instead . By August 8 , an estimated regiment of North Korean troops were across the Naktong . 
 = = = Counterattacks = = = 
 American counterattacks continued into the morning of August 7 , but the gains were slow , hampered by the hot weather and a lack of food and water . The North Koreans were able to press forward and regain the Cloverleaf Hill and Oblong @-@ ni Ridge , critical terrain astride the main road in the bulge area . By 16 : 00 that day , the 9th Infantry Regiment , 2nd US Infantry Division , a unit newly arrived in Korea , was sent to the region . Church immediately ordered it to attack the North Korean salient at the bulge . 9th Infantry was fresh and well @-@ equipped . They were also inexperienced , many of their number being reservists . Despite a tenacious attack , the 9th Infantry was only able to regain part of Cloverleaf Hill before intense fighting stalled its movement . 
 North Korean forces began making gains in the hills along the river adjacent to their bridgehead , against positions of the 34th Infantry . Coordinated attacks pushed A Company to the north back from their hills with heavy casualties on August 7 . K Company to the south was also attacked but held its line , reinforced by L Company on August 10 . Fighting continued for several days , resulting in heavy casualties as both sides captured and recaptured the hills along the Naktong , neither side able to gain a decisive advantage against the other . 
 = = = Task Force Hill = = = 
 In an attempt to destroy the North Korean bridgehead , Church assembled a large force under the 9th Infantry Regiment . Dubbed " Task Force Hill " , this force comprised the 9th , 19th , and 34th Infantry Regiments as well as 1st Battalion , 21st Infantry , plus supporting artillery and other attached units . It was assigned to drive the North Koreans from the east bank of the river on August 11 . Commanding the task force was Colonel John G. Hill , the Commanding Officer of the 9th Infantry Regiment . 
 The 4th North Korean Division , meanwhile , had constructed underwater bridges of sandbags , logs , and rocks , finishing the first on August 10 . 4th Division used it to move trucks and heavy artillery as well as additional infantry and a few tanks across the river . By the morning of August 10 , an estimated two KPA regiments were across the river and occupying fortified positions . Supplies continued to stream in through rafts . Task Force Hill mounted its attack , but was once again unable to make progress due to the newly established artillery . Its directive to attack quickly became one to dig in and hold its ground , and by nightfall the entire 4th North Korean Division was across the river . On August 10 , elements of 4th North Korean began to move south , outflanking Task Force Hill . The next day , scattered North Korean elements attacked Yongsan . KPA repeatedly attacked at night , when American soldiers were resting and had greater difficulty resisting . 
 = = = Reinforcements = = = 
 On August 12 , General Walton Walker , in command of the Eighth Army , dispatched part of the 27th Infantry Regiment , 25th US Infantry Division , to attack north from the 25th Division 's zone to drive off 4th North Korean Division troops moving into Yongsan . Simultaneously , Church assembled all the combat service support soldiers he could and formed them into a combat unit to block further penetration of North Korean forces , which were setting up roadblocks on the roads from Yongsan . 
 Additional reinforcements poured in . The rest of the 27th Infantry moved in , as well as a battalion from the 23rd Infantry Regiment , 2nd US Infantry Division . These were able to push North Korean infiltrators out of Yongsan and back to their firmly held positions at Cloverleaf Hill . On August 14 , following an artillery barrage , Task Force Hill launched a direct assault on these positions . Fighting continued the entire day in a fierce series of attacks and counterattacks in which both sides , already at far reduced strength , inflicted large numbers of casualties . However , Task Force Hill 's second attack was just as unsuccessful as its first . Casualties among officers was high in the fight , and the disorganization that followed meant most of the units in the fight could not communicate to coordinate any large actions . It became a battle of attrition by August 15 as neither 4th North Korean Division nor Task Force Hill were able to get the upper hand in the fight , which in several cases erupted in desperate hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat . Casualties mounted and a frustrated Walker ordered the 5 @,@ 000 @-@ man 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the area to turn the tide . The brigade moved from the Masan region in the middle of a counteroffensive being conducted by the 25th US Infantry . 
 The 4th North Korean Division in the meantime was suffering serious logistical setbacks from lack of food , equipment , ammunition and , weapons . Conscripts from local South Korean villages were brought in to replace mounting losses . There was also virtually no provision for the wounded in the division , and the North Korean forces began to come apart under these stresses . Still , the division 's morale remained relatively high and General Lee refused to withdraw . 
 = = = Destruction of the bridgehead = = = 
 The 1st Marine Provisional Brigade , in conjunction with Task Force Hill , mounted a massive offensive on Cloverleaf Hill and Obong @-@ ni on August 17 . The offensive began at 0800 on August 17 , with US forces unleashing all heavy weapons available to them against the North Korean positions ; artillery , mortars , M26 Pershing tanks , and airstrikes . 
 At first , tenacious KPA defense halted the Marines who responded with artillery , raking Cloverleaf Hill . Heavy indirect fire forced the North Koreans out of their positions before the Marines and Task Force Hill eventually overwhelmed them , one hill at a time . The Marines approached Obong @-@ ni first , destroying resistance on the slope with an airstrike and a barrage from US tanks , but strong resistance caused heavy casualties , and they had to withdraw . The 18th North Korean Regiment , in control of the hill , mounted a disastrous counterattack in hopes of pushing the Marines back . The division 's tactics of cutting off supplies and relying on surprise , which had provided them so much success up to this point , failed in the face of massive US numerical superiority . 
 By nightfall on August 18 , 4th North Korean Division had been annihilated ; huge numbers of deserters had weakened its numbers during the fight , but by that time , Obong @-@ ni and Cloverleaf Hill had been retaken by the US forces . Scattered groups of North Korean soldiers fled back across the Naktong , pursued by American planes and artillery fire . The next day , the remains of 4th Division had withdrawn across the river . In their hasty retreat , they left a large number of artillery pieces and equipment behind which the Americans later pressed into service . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The battle caused massive casualties for both sides . By the end of the fight , 4th North Korean Division had been completely destroyed , with only 300 or 400 men in each of its regiments . Of its original 7 @,@ 000 men , the regiment now had a strength of only 3 @,@ 500 , having suffered over 1 @,@ 200 killed . Several thousand of the members of the division deserted during the fight . Most of these men were South Korean civilians forcibly conscripted into the North Korean army . 4th Division would not recover until much later in the war . The battle represented a new phase in the war for the North Koreans . Their numerical superiority was gone , and their strategy of attacking supply lines and rear formations of US units was no longer effective without overwhelming numbers . Additionally , the advantage the T @-@ 34 tank had once provided was also gone ; American units were now well equipped with effective anti @-@ tank weapons , as well as larger numbers of tanks of their own . Subsequently , all 4th Division 's T @-@ 34s were quickly knocked out before they could inflict much damage . 
 The 9th Infantry and supporting units sustained 57 killed , 106 wounded , two captured , and 13 missing , a total of 180 casualties . The 21st Infantry suffered around 30 killed and 70 wounded , the 19th Infantry around 450 casualties , and the 34th Infantry around 400 . The 27th Infantry reported around 150 . The 1st Provisional Brigade reported 66 Marines dead , 278 wounded , and one missing . In total , American forces suffered around 1 @,@ 800 casualties during the conflict , including about a third them killed . 
 In memory of the battle at Naktong Bulge , as well as other conflicts along the Pusan Perimeter and the Battle of Taegu , the South Korean government set up the Nakdong River Battle Museum along the river in the vicinity of the conflict in 1979 , which includes a number of artifacts from the Korean War as well as a memorial to those killed during the war . 
 = Battle of Karameh = 
 The Battle of Karameh ( Arabic : معركة <unk> ) was a 15 @-@ hour military engagement between the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) and combined forces of the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) and the Jordanian Armed Forces ( <unk> ) in the Jordanian town of Karameh on 21 March 1968 , during the War of Attrition . It was planned by Israel as one of two concurrent raids on PLO camps , one in Karameh and one in the distant village of Safi — codenamed Operation Inferno ( Hebrew : מבצע <unk> ) and Operation Asuta ( מבצע <unk> ) , respectively — but the former turned into a full @-@ scale battle . 
 After the Six @-@ Day War in 1967 , the PLO and Fatah stepped up their guerrilla attacks against Israel from Jordanian soil , using the border town of Karameh as their headquarters . Though the Israeli invasion , whose purpose was to destroy the Palestinian militant camps at Karameh and capture Yasser Arafat , was primarily motivated as a reprisal for these new attacks , the two operations had been prepared a year earlier . It is also believed that Israel wanted to punish Jordan for its support to the PLO . The Jordanian assessment of the dimensions of the force Israel had dispatched for the raid was that Israel entertained a further goal , that of capturing the Balqa Governorate to create a similar situation to that in the Golan Heights . Though Israel assumed the Jordanian Army would choose to not get involved in the battle , the latter deployed heavy fire on the attacking Israeli forces while fighting alongside the Palestinians . The engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian forces . The Israelis withdrew , or were repulsed , after a day long battle , having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken around 140 PLO members prisoner . The battle resulted in the issuance of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 248 , which condemned Israel for violating the cease @-@ fire line and its disproportionate use of force . 
 Both sides declared victory . On a tactical level , the battle went in Israel 's favor , and the aim of destroying the Karameh camp was achieved . On the other hand , the relatively high casualties sustained came as a considerable surprise for the Israel Defense Forces and stunned the Israelis . On a rare occasion , Israel failed to retrieve three dead soldiers , who were left behind in Karameh along with several damaged Israeli vehicles and tanks , later paraded in Amman by the Jordanians . Although the Palestinians had limited success in inflicting Israeli casualties , King Hussein let them take the credit . Palestinians used the battle 's wide acclaim and recognition in the Arab world to establish their national claims . After the battle , King Hussein proclaimed , " I think we may reach a position where we are all fedayeen " . As the PLO 's strength began to grow in the aftermath of the battle , Fedayeen began to speak openly of taking over Jordan , and the ensuing tensions eventually precipitated in Black September in 1970 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Palestinian groups used to initiate few attacks on Israeli targets from both the West Bank and Jordan before the Six @-@ Day War , some of which caused Israel to retaliate which became known as the Reprisal operations . Following the seizure of the West Bank from Jordan in the June 1967 Six @-@ Day War , Israel destroyed the existing Palestinian group Fatah networks there . In early 1968 , however , Fatah guerrillas began raiding Israel from bases on the Jordanian side of the river . Most of these attacks were blocked by the Israel Defense Forces . At times , Jordanian Army infantry and artillery units gave the Fatah squads covering fire , leading to frequent direct skirmishes between the IDF and the Jordanian Army . On 14 – 15 February , Jordanian mortars hit several Israeli settlements in the Beit Shean Valley and Jordan Valley . Israeli artillery and air forces retaliated against Jordanian bases and artillery batteries , as well as the American @-@ financed East <unk> Canal ( now known as the King Abdullah Canal ) . As a result , thousands of Jordanian farmers fled eastwards , and fedayeen ( agents willing to sacrifice themselves for the Palestinian cause ) moved into the valley . An American @-@ sponsored ceasefire was arranged , and King Hussein declared he would prevent these groups from using Jordan as a base for attack . 
 In February , King Hussein sent twenty carloads of troops and police to order a Fatah unit to leave the town of Karameh . When it arrived , the column found itself surrounded by men wielding machine guns ; their commander said " You have three minutes to decide whether you leave or die " . They withdrew . By March , several hundred civilians lived in the camp , along with about 900 guerrillas , mostly from Fatah , and PLO leader Yasser Arafat , who had his headquarters there . 
 In Israel , Chief of the Military Intelligence Directorate Aharon <unk> stated that a raid would damage Fatah 's prestige . On the other hand , Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban and his chief of bureau Gideon Rafael — mindful of an adverse American reaction due to the good relationship between Jordan and the US — worried a raid could result in innocent civilian deaths and be a political disservice to Israel . Chief of Staff Haim Bar @-@ Lev promised a " clean action " . Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan asked for a " principal approval " for a raid , but this was denied by the cabinet . On 13 December , Operation Karameh was scheduled for the next night , it was placed in the hands of both Brigade 35 of the Paratroop Corps and the Sayeret Matkal special @-@ operations force . The operation was called off , rescheduled for 12 March and then called off again . Dayan warned the other ministers that a bus might strike a mine . On 18 March , an Israeli school bus was blown up by a mine near Be 'er Ora in the Arava , killing two adults and wounding ten children . This was the 38th Fatah operation in little more than three months . That night , the cabinet approved the attack . The U.S. tried to prevent it by forwarding Israel a message from King Hussein . Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol called in the cabinet for further counseling ; only the National Religious Party leader Haim @-@ Moshe Shapira vocally opposed the attack , while Education Minister Zalman Aran opposed it too but remained silent . There was an intelligence informant who was a former Fatah member , code @-@ named " Grotius " who was said to be familiar with the base in Karameh and its surroundings . Grotius is said to have arrived in Jordan as a member of the 421st Commando Battalion of the Palestine Liberation Army , on the eve of the Six @-@ Day War . After deserting his battalion , he trained in Syria at the Hama camp and later slipped into the West Bank . Israel assumed that the Jordanians would ignore the invasion , however , the Israelis were met with heavy resistance from them . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 On 4 March , Jordanian intelligence began to detect Israeli activity near the border , as IDF troops began to concentrate near the Allenby Bridge ( known now as King Hussein Bridge ) and Damia Bridge ( known now as Adam Bridge ) . Jordan ordered the 1st Infantry Division to take up positions near those bridges and around Karameh . On 17 March , Dayan warned that the fedayeen were preparing for a " new wave of terror , " which Israel would take steps to contain if King Hussein of Jordan could not . Eshkol repeated that message to the Knesset , and on the same day , Israeli Ambassador Yosef <unk> filed two complaints with the United Nations against what he termed " the Arabs ' repeated acts of aggression . " 
 By 20 March , Jordan had identified parts of the Israeli 7th Armored Brigade , 60th Armored Brigade , 35th Paratroop Brigade , 80th Infantry Brigade , a combat engineer battalion and five artillery battalions between Allenby and Damia bridges . The Jordanians assumed the Israelis were planning an attack with a drive on Amman , and the army took up positions near the bridges , with the 60th Armored Brigade joining the 1st Infantry Division . Jordan also added most of its armored car , antitank and artillery units to the 1st Infantry Division . The total firepower was 105 Patton tanks and 88 artillery pieces . The infantry divisions were deployed near the bridges , each with a tank company . The artillery was mostly deployed on the higher Jordan Valley ridges overlooking Karameh for topological advantage . 
 The Israeli forces amounted to less than a brigade of armor , an infantry brigade , a paratroop battalion , an engineering battalion and five battalions of artillery . The units were divided into four task forces . The largest of these was to cross the Allenby Bridge and reach Karameh from the south ; a second one was to cross the <unk> Bridge , and reach Karameh from the north , thus completing a pincer move . Meanwhile , paratroopers were to be lifted by helicopters into the town while the fourth force would make a diversionary attack at King Abdullah Bridge to draw the Jordanian forces from Karameh and to cover the main attack . 
 Prior to the attack , the Israeli Air Force ( IAF ) dropped leaflets telling the Jordanian army that Israel had no intention to hurt them , and that they should not intervene ; the leaflets went unheeded . Time magazine reported the fedayeen had been warned in advance by Egyptian intelligence , and most of the 2 @,@ 000 Arab commandos who used Karameh as a training base had pulled back into the surrounding hills to snipe at the Israelis . Some 200 guerrillas stayed inside to defend the town . Later , Arafat 's deputy , Abu Iyad , claimed in his memoirs that he and Arafat had been tipped off about the Israeli attack by Jordanian officers , who learned it from the CIA . 
 = = Battle = = 
 At 5 : 30 AM on 21 March , the Israeli forces attacked simultaneously on the three bridges . Combat engineers built a pontoon bridge in the north and the troops crossed the river . The Israeli spearheads pushed across the Allenby Bridge and advanced towards <unk> <unk> . 
 At 6 : 30 AM , Israeli helicopters started landing the bulk of the paratrooper battalion north of Karameh . An Israeli aircraft was supposed to drop leaflets addressed to Fatah , after the paratroopers had surrounded the town ; however , due to difficult weather conditions , the helicopters flying the paratroopers arrived twenty minutes too late . Met with resistance by Fatah commandos and Jordanian regulars supported by Jordanian artillery , the paratroopers suffered heavy losses . When the southern task force began their drive north towards Karameh , they encountered a Jordanian infantry brigade supported by armor , artillery and antitank weapons . The Israeli Air Force launched airstrikes , but was only able to inflict minor damage on the dug @-@ in Jordanians . Fighting from their entrenched positions , the Jordanians repelled several Israeli assaults . 
 In the south , Jordanian artillery shelling prevented the Israelis from erecting another pontoon bridge on the site of the Abdullah bridge , halting the Israeli advance there . After crossing the Allenby Bridge , the 7th Armored Brigade spread in three directions from Shuna : One or more companies drove north to Karameh . An infantry battalion and a tank battalion moved east to block the Salt road . And another infantry battalion moved south to assist the force trying to break across the Abdullah Bridge . Meanwhile , the force that crossed the Damia Bridge established itself on the east bank . Engineers began constructing a new bridge , and the force advanced east to the Musri junction . After taking Musri , their intended advance south to Karameh was repulsed by the northern brigade of the Jordanian 1st Division . 
 The force driving on Karameh via the Allenby bridge broke through and proceeded to the town , arriving shortly before 7 : 00 . By 8 : 00 the Israeli forces had taken control of the town , which turned out to be a bigger PLO base than the Israelis expected . Combined with the paratroopers , this Israeli force engaged in heavy fighting against the central brigade of the 1st division and a number of Fatah fighters . Some of the paratroopers and armor drove north to operate in the Fatah camp . The paratroopers destroyed most of the camp ; many of the Palestinians , including Arafat , fled eastward . The rest of the Allenby Bridge force was blocked to the east and south of Shuna , by elements of the 1st Division 's central and southern brigades , and by a tank battalion from Salt . A small force of Israeli infantry and armor , on the right flank of Israeli forces invading from the south , tried to protect the <unk> bridge force from attacks by the Jordanian forces deployed near the King Abdullah bridge . The Jordanians attacked with some armor , but the Israelis put up resistance , and the battle turned into a stalemate . 
 A large force of Israeli infantry and armor went east to block the road from Salt to the Allenby bridge , and they encountered the Jordanian 60th Armored Brigade trying to join the defense of Karameh . In the resulting battle , the Jordanians lost eight Patton tanks without destroying any Israeli tanks , then withdrew to the hills to dig in and continue firing down on the Israelis . The Israeli Air Force launched airstrikes against Jordanian armor and artillery positions , but was unable to stop the firing . Within the next two hours , Israeli artillery fire and airstrikes were launched against Jordanian defenses on the Musri @-@ Karameh road , the Salt road , and east of Abdullah Bridge . The Israelis also consolidated their hold on Karameh with airstrikes and artillery , and began demolishing the camp . A total of 175 houses were blown up . 
 Meanwhile , Operation Asuta was mounted against a few smaller guerrilla bases south of the Dead Sea , near Safi , where the school bus had struck the mine . The bases were raided by Israeli ground forces with close air support . About 20 Jordanian soldiers and policemen and 20 Fatah fighters were killed , and 27 were taken prisoner . The Israelis suffered no casualties . Frustrated in their hope to entrap the entire PLO force , the Israelis soon pulled out , but had to fight their way back to Israeli territory . At 11 : 00 the Israelis began to withdraw , with Sikorsky H @-@ 34 helicopters evacuating the troops . Because orders came down to recover as many vehicles as possible , they only completed their withdrawal by 20 : 40 . They had planned a rescue for its two tanks which were left in Jordan , but later withdrew the plan .

 Casualties estimates vary : 
 Israel : Chaim Herzog and Kenneth Pollack estimate 28 dead and 69 wounded ; Shabtai <unk> gives 32 killed and 70 wounded out of a force of 1 @,@ 000 soldiers . Benny Morris writes that Israel lost 33 dead and 161 wounded . 27 Israeli tanks were damaged by Jordanian artillery , 4 of which were left behind , two half @-@ tracks , six armored cars and Dassault <unk> aircraft , although the pilot succeeded in parachuting to safety .

 Jordan : Zeev <unk> and Benny Morris cite a figure of some 84 Jordanian soldiers killed and another 250 wounded . Four were captured . 30 tanks were damaged . Other estimates claim 40 dead and 108 wounded . 
 PLO : Herzog : 200 dead , 150 captured ; Morris : 156 dead , 141 captured ; Pollack : 100 dead , 100 wounded , 120 – 150 captured . According to Morris , a further 20 PLO guerillas were killed and 27 captured during the corresponding Operation Asuta . <unk> states 170 killed and 130 taken prisoner . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Israel accomplished its objective of destroying the Fatah camp , and on a tactical level , the battle did indeed end in Israel 's favor . " The Karama operation exposed the vulnerability of PLO units deployed along the Jordan River and so they moved their concentrations up into the mountains . This imposed additional strains on them and made their operations into the West Bank even more involved and difficult than they had been hitherto . " Politically however , Israel was heavily condemned by the world opinion . U.S. Ambassador to the UN , Arthur Goldberg , said " We believe that the military <unk> such as those which have just taken place , on a scale out of proportion to the acts of violence that preceded it , are greatly to be deplored . " US Ambassador to Israel , Walworth Barbour , said that in twenty years time , a historian would write that day down as the beginning of the destruction of Israel . Eban reported the <unk> 's statement to the cabinet , and Menachem Begin said such an utterance must not be cited in a cabinet meeting . 
 The relatively high casualties were a considerable surprise for the IDF and was stunning to the Israelis . Although the Palestinians were not victorious on their own , King Hussein let the Palestinians take credit . However , the battle of Karameh provided Fatah with a propaganda boost . The chief of bureau of the then Israeli Foreign ministry Gideon Rafael later said that " The operation gave an enormous lift to Yasser Arafat 's Fatah organization and irrevocably implanted the Palestine problem onto the international agenda , no longer as a humanitarian issue of homeless refugees , but as a claim to Palestinian statehood " . Uzi <unk> , who commanded the operation , resigned as chief of the Central Command for a position in the Jewish Agency shortly after the battle . 
 Jordan claimed to have won the battle and stopped an Israeli drive on Balqa Governorate in intentions of occupying it and turning into a security buffer zone , which was supposed to serve as a punishment , due to the Jordanian support to the PLO . The Jordanians made this assumption as they saw the size of the raiding Israeli forces entering the battle . Arafat said " What we have done is to make the world ... realize that the Palestinian is no longer refugee number so and so , but the member of a people who hold the reins of their own destiny and are in a position to determine their own future " . Palestinians and Arabs generally considered the battle a psychological victory over the IDF , which had been seen as ' invincible ' until then , and recruitment to guerilla units soared . Fatah reported that 5 @,@ 000 volunteers applied to join within 48 hours of the battle . By late March , there were nearly 20 @,@ 000 fedayeen in Jordan . 
 Iraq and Syria offered training programs for several thousand guerrillas . The Persian Gulf states , led by Kuwait , raised money for them through a 5 % tax on the salaries of their tens of thousands of resident Palestinian workers , and a fund drive in Lebanon raised $ 500 @,@ 000 from Beirut alone . The Palestinian organizations began to guarantee a lifetime support for the families of all guerrillas killed in action . Within a year after the battle , Fatah had branches in about eighty countries . 
 After the battle , Fatah began to engage in communal projects to achieve popular affiliation . The battle of Karameh and the subsequent increase in the PLO 's strength are considered to have been important catalysts for the 1970 events of the civil war known as Black September , in which the kingdom managed to expel the Palestinian groups to Lebanon after they had started to gain control over Jordan . 
 Later , the United Nations Security Council issued resolution 248 which condemned the Israeli raid on Jordanian territory and the violation of the cease @-@ fire line , it recalled on resolutions 237 which had encouraged Israel to ensure the safety of civilians in military areas . The resolution affirmed that reprisals were not to be tolerated and that repetitions of such violations would have forced the Security Council to take further steps . 
 The battle was the first engagement between the Israelis and Palestinians , in which the latter used suicide bombers . 
 In a 2011 report by Haaretz , files released by the IDF had contradicted the official Israeli story that claimed that the operation was a retaliatory for the bus incident . The files revealed that the IDF had plans for the two operations , prepared in 1967 , one year before the bus incident . Files also revealed that the IDF had practiced crossing the Jordan River in 1966 during the Jordanian occupation of the West Bank .

 Arab history of the war mentions that Israel had entered the Battle of Karameh with too much confidence , since it took place just after Israel had defeated the Arabs in the 1967 Six @-@ Day War . The size of the Israeli forces entering Karameh made the Jordanians assume that Israel was also planning to occupy the eastern plateau of the Jordan River basin , namely Balqa Governorate , in order to create a Golan Heights similar situation so as to be used a bargaining chip . Jordanians claim that Moshe Dayan invited Israeli journalists on the previous day for lunch in western Jordan after occupying it . 
 The Battle of Karameh was the subject of many artworks , stamps and posters . 
 = Shapes ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Shapes " is the nineteenth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on April 1 , 1994 . " Shapes " was written by Marilyn Osborn , and directed by David Nutter . It featured guest appearances by Michael Horse , Ty Miller and Donnelly Rhodes . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , a stand @-@ alone plot which is unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Shapes " earned a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 6 , being watched by 7 @.@ 2 million households in its initial broadcast ; and received mixed reviews , with varied reaction to the episode 's handling of the werewolf genre and of its Native American themes . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In this episode , Mulder and Scully are called to Montana after a shooting on a farm near a Native American reservation . Investigating the case , the agents find that the dead man , and those that he attacked , may be capable of shapeshifting into ferocious beasts — a phenomenon which was documented in the very first X @-@ File . 
 " Shapes " was written after executives at Fox had suggested that the series should feature a " more conventional " type of monster , and producers James Wong and Glen Morgan began looking into Native American legends of the Manitou to form the basis of the episode 's concept . Much of the episode was filmed in Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows , British Columbia . 
 = = Plot = = 
 FBI agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder travel to Browning , Montana to investigate the killing of a Native American man , Joseph Goodensnake , by local ranch owner Jim Parker . The present killing appears to be motivated by a dispute over the ownership of a tract of land , although Parker claims that he fired on a monstrous animal rather than a human . Parker 's son , Lyle , bears scars that lend credence to the story . 
 At the scene of the shooting , Scully reasons that at the short range from which Goodensnake was shot , it would have been impossible to mistake him for an animal . However , Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature . Scully dismisses this , but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby . She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake , but knows that they could not have skinned him since no signs of such injury were found on the body . 
 The matter is complicated by the difficulties Mulder and Scully have with dealing with the Native American population , stemming from the experience of the locals with the FBI at the Wounded Knee incident in 1973 . Goodensnake 's sister Gwen is also bitter that her neighbors are too frightened of native legends to confront his death . Despite these misgivings , the agents find a seeming ally in Sheriff Charles Tskany , who permits Scully to make a cursory examination of Goodensnake 's body , but forbids a full autopsy . They discover that he had elongated canines , similar to those of an animal , and bears long @-@ healed scars similar to those borne by Lyle . After parting ways with the Sheriff , Scully asks Mulder why it seems he is expecting every piece of evidence they have come across . Mulder informs Scully that forty years previously there was a similar incident in the area , which was investigated by J. Edgar Hoover and became the FBI 's first X @-@ File case . 
 Goodensnake 's body is cremated in a traditional ceremony , while the agents watch from a distance . Mulder shares with Scully his belief that both the culprits in both the current case and Hoover 's investigation are werewolves . Scully dismisses this theory and instead credits the belief to clinical lycanthropy . The elder Parker is subsequently ripped apart by an unseen animal outside his home , and Lyle is found naked and unconscious a few hundred yards away . 
 Ish , one of the elder men of the reservation , explains to Mulder the legend of the manitou , a creature which can possess and transform a man and which can pass to a new host , through a bite , or upon the death of the original host . Ish believes he had seen the creature in his youth , but was too frightened to confront it . He says it happens every eight years to someone in the region , and that it has been that long since the last sighting of a possible manitou . 
 An examination of Lyle reveals his father 's flesh in his stomach , though not before Scully brings him home from the hospital . After the medical examiner calls , Mulder and Tskany hurry to the Parker ranch . The beast has already arrived at the ranch house , and has stalked Scully into the attic of the Parker home . Just as the creature lunges from the shadows to attack Scully , she shoots it , thinking it was the Parker 's pet mountain lion , escaped . Outside , Mulder and Tskany see that the mountain lion is still in its cage , and discover Lyle 's body in the attic . As the agents leave , they learn that Gwen has left town , while Ish cryptically warns Mulder , " See you in about eight years " .

 " Shapes " was written after executives at Fox had suggested that the series should feature a " more conventional " type of monster , and producers James Wong and Glen Morgan began looking into Native American legends of the Manitou to form the basis of the episode 's concept , believing that " a horror show should be able to do these legends that have been around since the thirteen hundreds " . The episode made mention of the first X @-@ File case to have been opened , apparently initiated by J. Edgar Hoover in 1946 ; whilst it also references the events of the earlier first season episode " Beyond the Sea " , as Scully is seen discussing her father 's death . " Shapes " marked the first time an episode of The X @-@ Files had made use of Native American themes and folklore . Whilst this episode was a stand @-@ alone ' monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week ' story , later episodes beginning with the second season finale " Anasazi " , would begin to incorporate Navajo cultural references into the show 's overarching mythology . 
 Guest star Michael Horse , who plays Sheriff Charles Tskany , is the third guest star of the series to have previously appeared alongside David Duchovny in Twin Peaks , after fellow alumni Claire Stansfield , who played the Jersey Devil in the episode of the same name , and Don Davis who had portrayed Agent Scully 's father William in the earlier episode " Beyond the Sea " . Davis would reappear in the second season 's " One Breath " , whilst other Twin Peaks actors would appear in later episodes of the series — Michael J. Anderson in the second season 's " Humbug " , Kenneth Welsh in the third season 's " Revelations " and Richard Beymer in " Sanguinarium " from the fourth season . 
 Much of the episode was filmed in Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows , British Columbia , on a site named Bordertown — a " classic western " town that had been built specifically for film sets , located just a " ten @-@ minute drive " from first assistant director Tom Braidwood 's home . The area was chosen as it provided locations for the exterior shots of the reservation , plus all of the interior areas that were needed for the episode . Despite covering the area in gravel , heavy rains left the ground sodden and muddy enough to bog down equipment and vehicles . Similar weather conditions would hinder the filming of the next episode , " Darkness Falls " . The funeral pyre scene was lit mostly using the natural light of the bonfire used ; whilst the extras who sang and prayed were cast by director David Nutter after a visit to a weekly meeting of Native Americans in Vancouver , who felt that casting non @-@ professionals would lend the scene more authenticity .

A total of 7 @.@ 2 million households watched this episode during its original airing . 
 In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly , the episode was rated a D + , being described as having a " garden @-@ variety werewolf plot " that offered " nothing much to sink your teeth into " . Zack Handlen , writing for The A.V. Club , described the episode as " thoroughly predictable " . He found the plot to be unoriginal , believing that it existed " more out of a sense of tradition than any real desire to tell a specific story " ; however , he praised the acting in the episode , especially that of guest star Michael Horse . Matt Haigh , writing for Den of Geek , described " Shapes " as being " a very basic and slightly drawn @-@ out werewolf and detective story " , though overall finding that the episode 's visual effects and atmosphere meant that it " mostly comes out good in the end " . " Shapes " has been criticized for seeming like a " werewolf tale with Native American trappings " , with its attempts at political correctness being seen as forced . However , it was praised for not adhering to the " noble savage " archetype in its portrayal of the Native American characters . Jane Goldman , in The X @-@ Files Book of the Unexplained , feels that the episode seriously misrepresents the folklore it portrays , noting that " for many natives , calling a crazed , man @-@ eating beast ' Manitou ' is like calling Charles Manson ' God ' " . The plot for " Shapes " was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by Ellen Steiber . 
 = 2012 FA Cup Final = 
 The 2012 FA Cup Final was a football match between Chelsea and Liverpool on 5 May 2012 . It was the final match of the 2011 – 12 FA Cup , the 131st season of the world 's oldest football knockout competition , the FA Cup . Chelsea were participating in their eleventh final , they had previously won six and lost four . Liverpool were appearing in their fourteenth final , they had won seven times and lost six . Scheduled to provide a clear four @-@ week period between the end of the English season and the start of UEFA Euro 2012 , the date of the final clashed with Premier League fixtures . To avoid having the final played at the same time as league games , the match kicked off at the later time of 5 : 15 p.m. , rather than the usual 3 : 00 p.m. , by which time the other fixtures had ended . 
 As both teams were in the highest tier of English football , the Premier League , they entered the competition in the Third Round . Matches up to the semi @-@ final were contested on a one @-@ off basis , with a replay taking place if the match ended in a draw . Chelsea 's matches ranged from comfortable victories to close affairs . They beat Tottenham Hotspur 5 – 1 in the semi @-@ final , while they beat Queens Park Rangers 1 – 0 in the Fourth Round . Liverpool 's matches were similar , with three ending in a 2 – 1 scoreline , while the other two against Oldham Athletic and Brighton & Hove Albion were won by at least four goals . 
 Watched by a crowd of 89 @,@ 102 , Ramires put Chelsea in front in the 11th minute after he disposed Liverpool midfielder Jay Spearing and beat Pepe Reina in the Liverpool area . They extended their lead in the 52nd minute when striker Didier Drogba scored . Liverpool substitute Andy Carroll scored in the 64th minute to reduce the deficit to one goal . Carroll thought he had scored a second in the 81st minute , but his header was saved on the line by Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Čech . Carroll ran off celebrating , as he thought the ball had crossed , but referee Phil Dowd did not award the goal and Chelsea held on to win the match 2 – 1 .

 As a Premier League team , Chelsea entered the competition in the Third Round , where they were drawn at home to Portsmouth . After a goalless first half Juan Mata struck early in the second , before Ramires hit two in two minutes and Frank Lampard scored in stoppage time to give Chelsea a 4 – 0 win . Chelsea then travelled to face local rivals Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road in the Fourth Round , where a controversial Mata penalty was enough to see them through . 
 Chelsea were drawn to play at home against Birmingham City in the Fifth Round , with Birmingham dominating the first half through a David Murphy goal . Daniel Sturridge scored in the second half to force a replay , which was played on 6 March at Birmingham , just two days after André Villas @-@ Boas was relieved of his duties as Chelsea manager . Birmingham held Chelsea throughout the first half , and looked the stronger side at times , but after Mata and Raul Meireles scored twice in five minutes , Chelsea dominated the remainder of the game until the final whistle . In the Sixth Round , Chelsea overcame Leicester City at home in a 5 – 2 thriller . Gary Cahill scored his first FA Cup goal for Chelsea from a corner in the 12th minute , with Salomon Kalou following up five minutes later . In the second half , Fernando Torres ended a goal drought of over 25 hours to score , before Jermaine Beckford gave Leicester a late lifeline . Torres scored again in the 85th minute to put the result beyond doubt , although Ben Marshall grabbed one back three minutes later , before Meireles scored in the 90th minute to send Chelsea through to the semi @-@ final . 
 In the semi @-@ final , Chelsea faced local rivals Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley . The first half was even , with both sides enjoying long spells of possession , until Didier Drogba put Chelsea ahead just before the break . Chelsea scored at the start of the second half . However , Juan Mata 's goal that did not appear to cross the line , but referee Martin Atkinson awarded the goal . Gareth Bale put Tottenham back in it with a goal shortly after a Petr Čech challenge on Emmanuel Adebayor . Despite the goal , Tottenham never took control of the game and Ramires scored in the 77th minute , followed minutes later by a Frank Lampard free kick , and a Florent Malouda strike in the fourth minute of added time . This secured Chelsea 's place in their first FA Cup Final since their 2010 triumph over Portsmouth .

 Liverpool – also a Premier League team – entered the competition in the Third Round too . Their opening match was a 5 – 1 home win against Oldham Athletic . Robbie Simpson opened the scoring for Oldham in the 28th minute , but Craig Bellamy equalised just two minutes later , with Steven Gerrard scoring a penalty to give Liverpool the lead . Jonjo Shelvey scored his first goal for the club in the second half , before late goals from Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing ensured progression to the Fourth Round . 
 For the Fourth Round , Liverpool were drawn at their home ground , Anfield against Manchester United . The match took place in the wake of the racial abuse row between Luis Suárez and Patrice Evra , for which Suárez was serving an eight @-@ match ban . Daniel Agger opened the scoring with a header from a corner , before Park Ji @-@ sung equalised for United before half @-@ time . With the match approaching full @-@ time , Dirk Kuyt scored in the 88th minute to give Liverpool a 2 – 1 victory and secured their place in the Fifth Round . Their opponents were Brighton & Hove Albion , whom Liverpool beat 6 – 1 at Anfield , courtesy of goals from Martin Škrtel , Carroll and Suárez , as well as three own goals . 
 Liverpool faced Stoke City in the Sixth Round at Anfield . Suárez scored in the 23rd minute to give Liverpool the lead , before former player Peter Crouch equalised three minutes later . Downing scored in the second half to secure a 2 – 1 for the club and ensure their place in the semi @-@ finals . Local rivals Everton were the opponents in the semi @-@ final , held at Wembley Stadium . <unk> <unk> scored in the 24th minute after a Liverpool defensive error , to give Everton a 1 – 0 lead . Liverpool equalised in the second half when Suárez scored after a back @-@ pass from Everton defender Sylvain Distin . The match looked to be heading towards extra time , before Carroll headed in a Craig Bellamy free kick in the 87th minute to give Liverpool a 2 – 1 victory and secure their place in the final for the first time since 2006 , when they defeated West Ham United .

 Appearing in the final for the fourteenth time , Liverpool had won the FA Cup seven times previously ( in 1965 , 1974 , 1986 , 1989 , 1992 , 2001 and 2006 ) , and had been beaten in the final six times ( in 1914 , 1950 , 1971 , 1977 , 1988 and 1996 ) . Chelsea were appearing in the final for the eleventh time . They had won the FA Cup six times previously ( in 1970 , 1997 , 2000 , 2007 , 2009 and 2010 ) , and had been beaten in the final four times ( in 1915 , 1967 , 1994 and 2002 ) . Liverpool and Chelsea had previously met nine times in the FA Cup , including two semi @-@ finals ( most recently in 2006 ) , although they had never met in the final before . Chelsea had the upper hand in those nine meetings , winning five times to Liverpool 's four ; however , Liverpool won both semi @-@ finals between the two clubs , both on neutral grounds . The only domestic cup final to feature both teams was the 2005 League Cup final , which Chelsea won 3 – 2 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff . 
 Liverpool and Chelsea had faced each other twice during the season , with Liverpool winning on both occasions . Liverpool won the first meeting in the 2011 – 12 Premier League 2 – 1 , they won their second meeting in the 2011 – 12 Football League Cup 2 – 0 , before winning the final against Cardiff City . As Liverpool and Chelsea had been due to play one another in the Premier League at Anfield on 5 May 2012 , the same day as the final , the FA announced that the league game would be postponed until Tuesday 8 May , meaning that the two sides would play each other twice in four days . 
 Both teams had injury concerns ahead of the final . Liverpool were expected to be without midfielders Charlie Adam and Lucas Leiva , who were both out with knee injuries , while Chelsea were missing defenders David Luiz and Gary Cahill to hamstring injuries . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was determined to claim a domestic double with victory in the final : " The FA Cup is special , but we got a taste of success from winning the Carling Cup . That will help the younger players in the squad . Winning breeds confidence and you want more . " Gerrard believed success in the final would compensate for a poor season in the Premier League : " We are all aware we have underachieved in the league and the squad of players is certainly better than where we are . We will assess the season and if we win two trophies I think it would alleviate the pressure slightly . " Chelsea captain John Terry was hopeful Chelsea would win the final , to help caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo 's hopes of getting the job full @-@ time : " To win it [ the Cup ] will put himself in a very good position . He 's not thinking of that at the moment , he 's not letting the players get distracted by anything . He 's very passionate , he 's Chelsea through and through , and that 's certainly rubbed off on the players . So , if we can do it with the added bonus that Robbie can get the job at the end , that 'd be great . " 
 In addition to the later kick @-@ off time , travelling supporters from Liverpool faced major difficulties getting to and from the final after Virgin Trains cancelled the majority of its direct services between Liverpool Lime Street Station and London Euston with maintenance work taking place over the May Day bank holiday weekend . Both teams were allocated 25 @,@ 074 tickets for the final , which was 7 @,@ 000 fewer than they received for the semi @-@ finals . 17 @,@ 000 tickets went to Club Wembley members , who are effectively season ticket holders at Wembley Stadium , while the remainder went to the grassroots football community .

 Chelsea kicked off the match and had the first shot off the match in the first minute , with a Didier Drogba shot going over the crossbar . Liverpool had more of the possession in the opening minutes , but striker Luis Suárez was struggling to maintain possession of the ball against the Chelsea defence . Chelsea scored in the 10th minute when Liverpool midfielder Jay Spearing lost possession of the ball to Ramires , he subsequently went past defender José Enrique into the Liverpool penalty area , where his shot went through goalkeeper Pepe Reina 's legs and into the goal to give Chelsea a 1 – 0 lead . Liverpool responded by going on the attack ; a Glen Johnson pass found striker Craig Bellamy , whose shot was cleared off the line by Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanović . Liverpool were struggling to maintain possession , with Steven Gerrard , playing deep in midfield , there was a lack of support for striker Suárez . Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard profited from Liverpool 's failure to hold on to possession , as he received the ball from a misplaced Jordan Henderson pass , but his shot 40 yards ( 37 m ) away from goal went wide . 
 In the 33rd minute , a Chelsea free @-@ kick , awarded after Ramires was brought down by Enrique , but it was cleared by the Liverpool defence . Enrique had the chance to counter Chelsea 's attack , but he delayed his run and was dispossessed . The first yellow card of the match was shown to Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel in the 36th minute , after a mistimed tackle on Gerrard . A cross from midfielder Stewart Downing was headed out for a Liverpool corner in the 40th minute , but the subsequent corner is cleared by Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Čech . Liverpool had another chance straight afterwards , but Suárez was unable to direct his header at goal after receiving the ball from Henderson . Towards the end of the half , Liverpool was shown a yellow card for his challenge on Mikel .

 Liverpool kicked off the second half , but it was Chelsea who had the first attack . Chelsea defender Ashley Cole had space in the Liverpool penalty area , but his pass to Juan Mata was intercepted by the Liverpool defence . They subsequently went on the attack and won a corner , but the ball into the Chelsea penalty area by Bellamy was cleared . Liverpool continued to attack , but were denied a penalty in the 50th minute , when Gerrard went down in the Chelsea penalty area . The ball was subsequently put back into the Chelsea penalty area by Downing , but Henderson could only head the ball to Chelsea players . Liverpool were made to rue their missed chances , as two minutes later Chelsea had extended their lead . Lampard got away from Spearing and passed to Drogba on the edge of the Liverpool penalty area , he advanced past Liverpool defender Martin Škrtel and shot through the legs of Reina and into the Liverpool goal to make the score 2 – 0 . Liverpool went on the offensive after the Chelsea goal . A Suárez shot was saved by Čech and manager Kenny Dalglish replaced midfielder Spearing with striker Andy Carroll . The substation worked , as in the 64th minute Carroll had scored . Downing won a tackle on the left hand side of the pitch , which resulted in the ball breaking to Carroll . His subsequent shot beat Čech in the Chelsea goal to reduce the deficit to 2 – 1 . 
 Liverpool continued to press forward following their goal . Carroll found Gerrard with a headed pass in the 71st minute , but Gerrard 's shot went over the crossbar . Two minutes later a shot by Suárez was saved by Čech and out for a Liverpool corner , but Agger 's header from the resulting corner went wide . Carroll had a number of chances in the subsequent minutes , but none of his headers were on target . Chelsea replaced goalscorer Ramires with midfielder Raul Meireles in the 76th minute and a minute later Bellamy was replaced by Dirk Kuyt for Liverpool . A minute after the substitution Suárez worked his way into the Chelsea half , his pass to Kuyt was cleared , but it fell to Henderson , whose shot went over the Chelsea goal . Carroll thought he equalised in the 81st minute when his header from a Suárez cross was then palmed by Čech onto the underside of the bar and away to safety . Carroll ran away celebrating his second goal , but after consulting with his assistant , referee Phil Dowd did not award the goal . Replays later appeared to indicate that the whole of the ball had not crossed the line . Liverpool continued to push forward for the equaliser in the closing minutes , but they were unable to score and the match finished 2 – 1 to Chelsea .

 Chelsea 's victory meant they won the FA Cup for the seventh time . Caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo was relaxed about his prospects of securing the full @-@ term following their victory : " The boss [ Roman Abramovich ] will make a decision at the end of the season . I 'm very relaxed about it and the players will be fine , I am a very fortunate person so it is not an issue . " Di Matteo was delighted with his players , as they survived Liverpool 's attacks in the final minutes to secure victory : " I am very pleased for the players , " said Di Matteo . " We have had a difficult season with a lot of criticism but they have responded to all the adversity we have faced . I 'm very pleased and satisfied with our performance today . " Chelsea captain John Terry was equally pleased with the performance , but turned his attention to the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final , where they would face Bayern Munich : " It 's fantastic , it 's what we live for . We 've still got a massive trophy , the Champions League - that 's the target for the owner from day dot . We 've done Robbie the world of good and it can do him no harm . " 
 Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was adamant that his players would improve following the defeat : " They 've been in two cup finals in this season – they 'll have enjoyed the first one more than the second , the lads will benefit from the experience . You can 't give a team like Chelsea a two @-@ goal head start . " When asked about his future as manager of the club Dalglish stated : " We 'll assess the season at the end of the season . " Captain Steven Gerrard echoed Dalglish 's sentiments : " With the players we have in that dressing room , we could have done better . But we are Liverpool . We will bounce back . We will strengthen in the summer and come back fighting again . That 's what Liverpool Football Club does . " Striker Andy Carroll , who scored one goal and had another disallowed , thought the ball had crossed the line : " I thought it was over the line and you know better than me but I thought it was . I thought it hit the other side of the bar but I haven 't seen it back . " 
 The two sides met in the Premier League three days after the final , a match that Liverpool won 4 – 1 . Liverpool finished the season in eighth place and Dalglish was subsequently sacked and replaced by Swansea City manager Brendan Rodgers . Chelsea would finish the season in sixth place ; however , they won the 2011 – 12 UEFA Champions League , beating Bayern Munich 4 – 3 in a penalty shoot @-@ out after the final finished 1 – 1 after extra time . Chelsea 's victory in the FA Cup final set up a Community Shield match against Manchester City , the winners of the 2011 – 12 Premier League . 
 The match was broadcast live in the United Kingdom , in HD on ITV1 and also on ESPN . A peak of 11 @.@ 2 million saw the climax of the game on ITV1 with 8 @.@ 9 million viewers on average watching the live match coverage . It was the highest @-@ rated final since the 2007 final . ESPN had 397 @,@ 000 viewers for its coverage of the final . 
 = 2006 New Jersey state government shutdown = 
 The 2006 New Jersey state government shutdown was the first shutdown in the history of the U.S. state of New Jersey . The shutdown occurred after the New Jersey Legislature and Governor Jon Corzine failed to agree on a state budget by the constitutional deadline . Furthermore , Corzine and the Legislature clashed on the issue of raising the state sales tax to help balance budget . Exercising his constitutional powers as governor , Corzine ordered the shutdown as a means of pressuring the Legislature to pass a budget . The shutdown began at midnight on July 1 , 2006 , when Corzine called for an orderly shutdown of non @-@ essential government services , which was followed by a second round of shutdowns three days later on July 4 . 
 The shutdown officially concluded after the legislature adopted a budget on July 8 , 2006 . All government services were restored by 8 : 30 am on July 10 , 2006 . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the 2005 gubernatorial election Corzine , a former executive at Goldman Sachs , claimed he was " not encumbered by an old culture , historical entanglements and the status quo " and had a plan to use his experience to overhaul the budget process and trim spending . When he introduced his first budget as governor , the $ 30 @.@ 9 billion plan included $ 2 billion in spending cuts as well as increases in taxes on tobacco , alcohol , and luxury cars . The most controversial item in the budget was an increase in the state sales tax . 
 The President of the New Jersey Senate , former Governor Richard Codey , had stated his support for Corzine 's budget including the tax increase . The stalemate in the negotiations had been with the New Jersey General Assembly , whose Speaker , Joseph J. Roberts , strongly rejected the Governor 's plan . At the time Roberts said , " Our caucus feels overwhelmingly that there are much more appealing alternatives to balance the budget than a sales tax increase . " 
 The New Jersey State Constitution , under Article VIII , Section II , paragraph 2 , requires that the state 's expenses for " as far as can be ascertained or reasonably foreseen " ( i.e. , the fiscal year ) be provided for in a single budget act . If this does not occur before the previous budget lapses , the same section also outlaws any expenditure of money . The constitution also includes a provision in the previous paragraph preventing appropriations from going into red ink ; the New Jersey Supreme Court had interpreted this to exclude loans made to cover shortfalls , and Corzine claimed that the state had a poor credit rating anyway . 
 In three of the previous five years , the legislature had failed to meet the June 30 deadline . On each of those occasions an agreement had been reached by the morning of July 2 . Aides to Corzine claimed that the governor felt he had no choice but to order the shutdown under the state 's Constitution . 
 = = Causes = = 
 Corzine , in attempting to pass his conceptual budget , came into conflict with fellow state Democrats in the New Jersey General Assembly , particularly over their refusal to implement his proposed increase of the state 's sales tax from 6 % to 7 % to fill a $ 4 @.@ 5 billion budget gap . Corzine maintained that the gap could not be filled by any other means due to the state 's constitution and a ruling of New Jersey 's Supreme Court . Long before the deadline date , Corzine had stated that he would not accept a budget that did not include a sales tax increase . Due to Corzine 's insistence , the state 's General Assembly , which was dominated by Democrats , refused to pass a budget before the deadline . 
 = = The shutdown = = 
 After the legislature failed to pass a budget by midnight July 1 when the old budget ended , the governor signed executive order number 17 that immediately stopped numerous non @-@ essential government functions , with more to come after the Independence Day holiday on July 4 , 2006 . 
 State functions that ceased immediately included the New Jersey Lottery ( the interstate Mega Millions game continued although players temporarily could not buy tickets in New Jersey ) , the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission , MVC offices and inspection stations , the New Jersey Department of Education and parts of the New Jersey Judiciary . Approximately 45 @,@ 000 state employees who were listed as " non @-@ essential " were told to stay home . 
 Later ( post @-@ July 4 ) shutdowns included state beaches , public parks , historic sites , gambling in New Jersey 's casinos in Atlantic City as well as horse racing in the Meadowlands Sports Complex and Monmouth Park Racetrack . 
 Casinos and race tracks were closed because official monitors from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and the New Jersey Racing Commission , respectively , were categorized as non @-@ essential . At the time , New Jersey law precluded gambling establishments from operating absent state oversight . Originally , the race tracks were scheduled to close with the first wave on July 1 , but a State Court order allowed them to close later . The casinos attempted a similar case , arguing that the state monitors overseeing the casinos were not paid by the state but by the casinos themselves , but the appeal was rejected at the New Jersey Supreme Court ; therefore they were forced to close . 
 According to The Philadelphia Inquirer , " New Jersey Transit , prisons , state police , developmental centers , veterans ' homes , mental hospitals , health and disease @-@ prevention offices , child welfare , work on transportation safety , response to environmental contamination , [ and ] inspectors of amusement parks " were not affected by the order to shut down . 
 = = Post @-@ shutdown governmental action = = 
 To restore government services , on July 3 , 2006 , Corzine signed an executive order calling for an unprecedented Independence Day session of the General Assembly to work on presenting him with a budget . Immediately after listening to the governor 's speech , the legislature voted by voice vote to adjourn the session . The General Assembly met again , without proposing a budget , the following day . 
 Meeting on the third day of the special session , Democratic factions within the General Assembly reached a compromise budget . That tentative budget proposed an increase in the state sales tax from 6 % to 7 % , which was estimated to generate an additional $ 1 @.@ 1 billion in revenue . The plan also included a requirement to use half of that for direct relief toward New Jersey 's property tax — highest of all states . The plan also called for the same dedicated purpose for all of the money raised by this sales tax increase in subsequent years . The new budget law included a provision for a constitutional amendment which was required , like all such amendments in the state , to be approved in an Election Day referendum . On November 7 , 2006 New Jersey voters approved this measure by a two to one margin statewide . 
 Early in the morning of July 8 , 2006 , both houses of the legislature passed the proposed budget . At 6 : 00 am that day , Corzine signed executive order number 19 to restore government services . The casinos in Atlantic City opened for business at 7 : 00 am Remaining government services , including race tracks and the state lottery , also reopened on July 8 , 2006 . State courts and motor vehicle offices resumed normal operations on July 10 , 2006 , fully ending the shutdown . 
 Corzine used his line @-@ item veto authority to reduce the budget by over $ 51 @.@ 3 million by eliminating or reducing over 50 spending items . 
 = = Effects = = 
 During the casino shutdown , 36 @,@ 000 casino workers were given leave . The shutdown of casinos resulted in lost revenue for the state , as an estimated $ 1 @.@ 3 million per day was collected in gambling taxes plus an additional $ 2 million per day due to the closure of the lottery system . However , the sum of revenue not collected during the shutdown from gambling amounted to just a small fraction of the state 's annual budget . Atlantic City 's 12 casinos suffered losses estimated at $ 16 – 20 million per day during the shutdown . Revenue losses to lottery vendors and casino employees have not been calculated . Legislation signed by Governor Corzine in June 2008 would keep casinos and racetracks open in the event of a future budget showdown , with the Governor noting that the casino industry is vital to the New Jersey economy and that it should not operate under the threat of closure as it did in 2006 . 
 All driver 's licenses and vehicle registrations that were to expire at the end of July were extended one month . 
 The increase in the rate of the state sales tax from 6 % to 7 % took effect on July 15 , 2006 , and also increased the sales tax rate in the state 's Urban Enterprise Zones ( <unk> ) from 3 % to 3 @.@ 5 % . A significant change was made in the payment of sales taxes by businesses operating in the <unk> in that they would be required to pay the entire amount of the full tax rate to the state on all appropriate purchases , and wait for the state to rebate them the difference . 
 The budget also included changes to products and services that are subject to the sales tax , effective October 1 , 2006 . The newly taxable items included downloaded music , ringtones , movies and books ; shipping and handling ; drapery and carpet dry cleaning ; floor installation ; contracted landscaping ; self @-@ storage ; tanning ; massages ; tattooing ; magazines ; investigation and security services such as armored cars and alarm systems ; limousines , except for those used in funerals ; memberships in health , athletic and shopping clubs ; and parking , except for employee parking , parking at municipal meters and parking already subject to municipal parking taxes . 
 Other immediate tax increases in the budget included an increase in the cigarette tax by $ 0 @.@ 175 per pack ; a 0 @.@ 4 % surcharge on automobile purchases of over $ 45 @,@ 000 @.@ 00 and on vehicles with an average combined city highway miles per gallon 19 or less ; a new 6 % tax on fur clothing ; an increase in the rental @-@ car tax from $ 2 to $ 5 per day ; and increases on several business taxes . 
 These additional revenues were expected , when combined with spending cuts including a reduction of $ 200 million in higher education spending , to meet the state 's balanced @-@ budget requirement . A clause was also inserted into the budget cutting state aid for schools that hold over $ 1 billion in endowments . The only school in New Jersey that fell into this category was Princeton University , which had an endowment with assets over $ 11 billion in 2006 . The university that had the largest endowment next to Princeton at the time was Drew University which had a $ 225 million endowment fund . 
 = = Political influences = = 
 Corzine 's shutdown of state government had some effect on New Jersey and national politics . According to Clay F. Richards , assistant director of a poll by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute , Corzine had a 44 % approval rating , his highest since January 2006 . The poll also indicated that 71 % of respondents disapproved of the legislature 's handling of its job . According to Richards , " New Jersey voters clearly blame the state legislature for the budget crisis , and say the property @-@ tax relief that the legislature insisted on in the compromise is more politics than real reform . " Of those polled , 23 % indicated that they would not vote for those representatives who voted for the sales @-@ tax hike in the future . The legislature 's next election was in November 2007 , but Corzine did not face re @-@ election until 2009 . 
 There was also speculation that the U.S. Senate race , already seen as tight , would be affected . Republican candidate Thomas Kean , Jr. said Democratic Senator Bob Menendez did not oppose Corzine 's tax hike because Corzine appointed Menendez to serve out the remainder of his own term in the Senate . 
 According to Peter Woolley , director of Fairleigh Dickinson University 's PublicMind poll , the situation of the election was similar to the 1990 election , when underdog Senate candidate Christie Whitman , a Republican , nearly defeated well @-@ known Senator Bill Bradley due to Democratic Governor Jim Florio 's <unk> and income @-@ tax increases . By August , Woolley concluded that the tax increase had had no effect on Menendez 's re @-@ election chances . 
 = Nairobi National Park = 
 Nairobi National Park is a national park in Kenya . Established in 1946 , the national park was Kenya 's first . It is located approximately 7 kilometres ( 4 mi ) south of the centre of Nairobi , Kenya 's capital city , with an electric fence separating the park 's wildlife from the metropolis . Nairobi 's skyscrapers can be seen from the park . The proximity of urban and natural environments has caused conflicts between the animals and local people and threatens animals ' migration routes . 
 Still , despite its proximity to civilisation and relative small size for an African national park , Nairobi National Park boasts a large and varied wildlife population . Migrating herbivores gather in the park during the dry season , and it is one of Kenya 's most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries . 
 = = History = = 
 Colonists arrived in the area where the park is located in the late 19th century . At this time , the Athi plains east and south of what is today Nairobi had plentiful wildlife . Nomadic Maasai lived and herded their cattle among the wildlife . Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above Nairobi . As Nairobi grew — it had 14 @,@ 000 residents by 1910 — conflicts between humans and animals increased . Residents of the city carried guns at night to protect against lions . People complained that giraffes and zebras walked on and ruined their flower beds . Animals were gradually confined to the expansive plains to the west and south of Nairobi , and the colonial government set this area aside as a game reserve . Settlers from Nairobi including Isak Dinesen , author of Out of Africa , rode horses among gazelles , impala , and zebras in this reserve . 
 The conservationist Mervyn Cowie was born in Nairobi . Returning to Kenya after a nine @-@ year absence in 1932 , he was alarmed to see that the amount of game animals on the Athi plains had dwindled . Expanding farms and livestock had taken the place of the game . He later recalled this place as a paradise that was quickly disappearing . At this time , the area that would later become Nairobi National Park was part of the Southern Game Reserve . Hunting was not permitted in the reserve , but nearly every other activity , including cattle grazing , dumping , and even bombing by the Royal Air Force was allowed . Cowie started to campaign for the establishment of a national park system in Kenya . The government formed a committee to examine the matter . 
 Officially opened in 1946 , Nairobi National Park was the first national park established in Kenya . Maasai pastoralists were removed from their lands when the park was created . Cowie was named as director of Nairobi National Park and held this position until 1966 . In 1989 , Kenyan President Daniel <unk> Moi burned twelve tons of ivory on a site within the park . This event improved Kenya 's conservation and wildlife protection image . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The park covers an area of 117 @.@ 21 square kilometres ( 28 @,@ 963 acres ) and is small in comparison to most of Africa 's national parks . The park 's altitude ranges between 1 @,@ 533 metres ( 5 @,@ 030 ft ) and 1 @,@ 760 metres ( 5 @,@ 774 ft ) . It has a dry climate . The park is the only protected part of the Athi @-@ Kapiti ecosystem , making up less than 10 % of this ecosystem . The park has a diverse range of habitats and species . 
 The park is located about 7 kilometres ( 4 mi ) from the Nairobi 's centre . There is electric fencing around the park 's northern , eastern , and western boundaries . Its southern boundary is formed by the <unk> River . This boundary is not fenced and is open to the Kitengela Conservation Area ( located immediately south of the park ) and the Athi @-@ Kapiti plains . There is considerable movement of large ungulate species across this boundary . 
 The fence that separates the park from the city runs along a high way leaving the airport , this is one fact many Kenyans are proud of – this park is the only natural safari park that has a city scape background that can be seen from almost any part of the park , as seen in the picture of the giraffe and the sky scrapers . 
 = = Flora = = 
 The park 's predominant environment is open grass plain with scattered Acacia bushes . The western uplands of the park have highland dry forest with stands of Olea africana , Croton <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> . The lower slopes of these areas are grassland . Themeda , cypress , Digitaria , and Cynodon species are found in these grassland areas . There are also scattered yellow @-@ barked Acacia <unk> . There is a riverine forest along the permanent river in the south of the park . There are areas of broken bush and deep rocky valleys and gorges within the park . The species in the valleys are predominantly Acacia and Euphorbia candelabrum . Other tree species include <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Ficus <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Rhus natalensis , and <unk> species . Several plants that grow on the rocky hillsides are unique to the Nairobi area . These species include Euphorbia <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . 
 = = Fauna = = 
 The park has a large and diverse wildlife population . Species found in the park include Cape buffaloes , baboons , black rhinos , gazelles , zebras , cheetahs , Coke 's hartebeest , hippopotami , leopards , lions , elands , impala , Masai giraffes , ostriches , vultures and <unk> . 
 Herbivores , including wildebeest and zebra , use the Kitengela conservation area and migration corridor to the south of the park to reach the Athi @-@ Kapiti plains . They disperse over the plains in the wet season and return to the park in the dry season . The concentration of wildlife in the park is greatest in the dry season , when areas outside the park have dried up . Small dams built along the <unk> River give the park more water resources than these outside areas . They attract water dependent herbivores during the dry season . The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in the dry season . The park has a high diversity of bird species , with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in the park . Dams have created a man @-@ made habitat for birds and aquatic species . 
 The David Sheldrick Trust runs a sanctuary in the park that hand @-@ rears orphaned elephant and rhinoceros calves , and later releases them back into secure sanctuaries . Orphaned and sick animals are brought to the sanctuary from all over Kenya . The sanctuary is located close to the park 's main entrance . It was opened in 1963 . It was set up by Daphne Sheldrick after the death of her husband David Sheldrick , the anti @-@ poaching warden of Tsavo National Park . Nairobi National Park is sometimes called <unk> Ark , which means " Rhinoceros Sanctuary " . It is one of Kenya 's most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries , and it is one of only a few parks where visitors can be certain of seeing a black rhinoceros in its natural habitat . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Mervyn Cowie oversaw the development of several of Kenya 's national parks and designed them with human visitors in mind . This emphasis helped to make tourism Kenya 's primary industry . However , it exacerbated problems between the human population and wildlife . Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into the establishment of the parks . Locals received very little benefit from the game animals . Livestock is threatened by lions , and some landowners think that Kenya 's wildlife is not good for them . In 1948 188 @,@ 976 people lived in Nairobi , and by 1997 the city 's population had grown to 1 @.@ 5 million . The park is under pressure from the city 's growing population and need for farmland . People live right next to the park 's boundaries , which creates human @-@ animal conflicts . The human population also creates pollution and garbage . <unk> and industrial waste from factories located along the park 's northern boundary contaminate the park 's surface and ground water systems . 
 Treaties with the Maasai in 1904 and 1911 forced them to give up all of their northern grazing lands on the Laikipia escarpment near Mount Kenya . Some of the people that lost land there were resettled in the Kitengela area . The Maasai 's pastoral life did not create any conflicts with the wildlife . Today the Kitengela 's former Maasai group @-@ ranches have been privatized and some of the land has been sold to Kikuyu farmers . Houses , cultivated plots , schools , shops , and bars are found on the Kitengela plains . Some of the park 's revenues have been used for community projects in order for the people living on the Kitengela to benefit from the presence of the national park . Many Maasai landowners have formed the Kitengela Landowners Association , which works with the Kenyan Wildlife Service to both protect the wildlife and find benefits for the locals . 
 The park and the Athi @-@ Kapiti Plains are linked by the migrations of wild herbivore populations . The plains to the south of the park are important feeding areas during the wet season . Before the city was established , herds of animals followed the rains and moved across the plains from Mount Kilimanjaro to Mount Kenya , a migration as great as the migration that takes place on the Serengeti . However , as the city grew the park became the northernmost limit of the animal 's migration . Migrating animals can reach their southern pastures by travelling through the part of the Athi plains called the Kitengela . This land is very important to their migration routes , but growth in the human population and the accompanying need for land threaten to cut off this traditional migration route from the park to land further south . The park 's migratory species are also threatened by changing settlement patterns , fencing , and their closeness to Nairobi and other industrial towns . These activities fragment their ecosystems and occupy their habitat . 
 = = Tourism and education = = 
 Nairobi National Park is the main tourist attraction for visitors to Nairobi . Visitor attractions include the park 's diverse bird species , cheetah , hyena , leopard , and lion . Other attractions are the wildebeest and zebra migrations in July and August , the Ivory Burning Site Monument , and the Nairobi Safari Walk and animal orphanage . Inhabitants of Nairobi visit the park and thousands of African children on school field trips visit the park each week . 
 The park 's Wildlife Conservation Education Centre has lectures and video shows about wildlife and guided tours of the park and animal orphanage . These tours are primarily , but not exclusively , to educate schools and local communities . There has been criticism about animals ' housing , and they now have more spacious housing in a more natural environment . The Kenya Wildlife Service has created a Safari Walk that highlights the variety of plants and animals that are in Kenya , and how they affect Kenya 's population .

 In Rainbows is the seventh studio album by the English rock band Radiohead , first self @-@ released on 10 October 2007 as a pay @-@ what @-@ you @-@ want download , followed by a physical release internationally by XL Recordings starting on 3 December 2007 and in the United States on 1 January 2008 by TBD Records . In Rainbows was Radiohead 's first release after the end of their contract with EMI labels Parlophone and Capitol Records . Recording with their longtime producer Nigel Godrich , Radiohead worked on the album for more than two years , beginning in early 2005 . Between recording , the band toured Europe and North America for three months during mid @-@ 2006 , performing many new songs from the album . The songwriting of the songs on In Rainbows is more personal than other Radiohead albums , with the band 's lead singer Thom Yorke describing most of the songs as his versions of " seduction songs " . With this album Radiohead also incorporated a variety of musical styles and instruments , using electronic music , string arrangements , pianos , and the ondes Martenot . 
 The pay @-@ what @-@ you @-@ want release , which was the first for a major act , made headline news all around the world and sparked debate about the implications for the music industry . Time called it " easily the most important release in the recent history of the music business " . Upon its physical release , In Rainbows entered the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200 at number one . By October 2008 , it had sold more than three million copies worldwide in both digital and physical formats . The album received critical acclaim and was ranked one of the best of 2007 and of the decade by several publications . In 2009 , it won two Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Special Limited Edition Package . In 2012 , Rolling Stone magazine ranked the album number 336 on their updated version of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time .

 In 2004 , after finishing the world tour in support of their sixth studio album Hail to the Thief ( 2003 ) , Radiohead went on hiatus . As Hail to the Thief was the last album released on Radiohead 's six @-@ album contract with Parlophone and Capitol Records , the band had no contractual obligation to release new material . Drummer Phil Selway said : " It was definitely time to take a break . There was still a desire amongst us to make music , but also a realisation that other aspects of our lives were being neglected . And we ’ d come to the end of our contract , which gives you a natural point to look back over at what you 've achieved as a band . " Singer and songwriter Thom Yorke worked on his first solo album , The Eraser ( 2006 ) , and multi @-@ instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood worked on soundtracks for the films <unk> ( 2004 ) and There Will Be Blood ( 2007 ) . 
 = = Recording = = 
 In March 2005 , Radiohead entered their Oxfordshire studio and began writing and recording new music . In an effort to " get out of the comfort zone " , they decided against involving producer Nigel Godrich , with whom they had recorded five albums . Regular recording sessions began in August 2005 , with the band updating fans on their progress intermittently on their new blog , Dead Air Space . The sessions were slow , and the band struggled to regain confidence ; according to Yorke , " we spent a long time in the studio just not going anywhere , wasting our time , and that was really , really frustrating . " Guitarist Ed O 'Brien said the band considered splitting up , but kept working " because when you got beyond all the shit and the bollocks , the core of these songs were really good . " They attributed their slow progress to a lack of momentum after their break and the lack of deadline and producer . 
 In December 2005 , Radiohead asked producer Spike Stent , who had worked with artists including U2 and Björk , to help them work through their material . O 'Brien told Mojo : " Spike listened to the stuff we 'd been self @-@ producing . These weren 't demos , they ’ d been recorded in proper studios , and he said , ' The sounds aren 't good enough . ' " The collaboration with Stent was unsuccessful and ended in April 2006 . In an effort to break the deadlock , Radiohead decided to tour for the first time since 2004 ; according to Yorke , " We basically had all these half @-@ formed songs , and we just had to get it together . And rather than it being a nightmare , it was really , really good fun , because suddenly everyone is being spontaneous and no one 's self @-@ conscious because you 're not in the studio ... It felt like being 16 again . " In May and June 2006 , Radiohead toured major cities in Europe and North America and returned to Europe for several festivals in August , performing many new songs . 
 After the tour , Radiohead re @-@ enlisted Godrich , who , according to Yorke , " gave us a walloping kick up the arse " . In October 2006 , recording started at Tottenham House in Marlborough , Wiltshire , a country house scouted by Godrich where Radiohead worked for three weeks . The band members lived in caravans , as the building was in a state of disrepair ; Yorke described it as " derelict in the stricter sense of the word , where there 's holes in the floor , rain coming through the ceilings , half the window panes missing ... There were places you just basically didn 't go . It definitely had an effect . It had some pretty strange vibes . " The sessions were productive , and the band recorded " Jigsaw Falling into Place " and " Bodysnatchers " . In October , Yorke wrote on Dead Air Space that Radiohead had " started the record properly now ... starting to get somewhere I think . Finally . " 
 In December 2006 , further sessions took place at Halswell House , Taunton and Godrich 's Hospital Studios in Covent Garden , where the band recorded " Videotape " and " Nude " . In January 2007 , Radiohead resumed recording in their Oxfordshire studio and started to post photos , lyrics , videos and samples of new songs on Dead Air Space . In June , having wrapped up recording , Godrich posted clips of songs on Dead Air Space . 
 Not including " Last Flowers " , which Yorke recorded in the Eraser sessions , the In Rainbows sessions produced 16 songs . After the 56 @-@ minute , 14 @-@ track Hail to the Thief , Radiohead wanted their seventh album to be concise ; they settled on ten songs , saving a further six tracks ( not counting short instrumentals ) for the limited edition " discbox " release . The album was mastered by Bob Ludwig in July 2007 at Gateway Mastering , New York City .

 In Rainbows features many tracks debuted on Radiohead 's 2006 tour , including " 15 Step " , " Bodysnatchers " , " All I Need " , " Videotape " , " Arpeggi " ( retitled " Weird Fishes / Arpeggi " ) and " Open Pick " ( retitled " Jigsaw Falling Into Place " ) . Radiohead first performed " Nude " during the OK Computer world tour in a different arrangement . The band performed a song with the working title of " Reckoner " in 2001 ; working on the song in the In Rainbows sessions , they abandoned the original material and created a new song with the same name . Yorke released the song originally known as " Reckoner " as a solo single , " Feeling Pulled Apart by Horses " , in 2009 . 
 On the opening track " 15 Step " , the band enlisted the help of a group of children from the Matrix Music School & Arts Centre in Oxford . Colin Greenwood and Godrich originally set out to record handclaps for the song , but when the clapping proved " not quite good enough " , they decided to record the children cheering instead . " Bodysnatchers " , a song Yorke described as sounding like Wolfmother and " Neu ! meets dodgy hippy rock " , was recorded when he was in a period of " hyperactive mania " . On " All I Need " , Jonny Greenwood wanted to recapture the white noise generated by a band playing loudly in a room , a sound which never occurs in the studio . His solution was to have a string section play every note of the scale , blanketing the frequencies . Yorke described the process of composing " Videotape " as " absolute agony " , stating that the song " went through every possible parameter " . One day , Yorke left the studio , returning to find that Godrich and Jonny Greenwood had stripped the song down to the version found on the album , a minimal piano ballad . 
 Yorke has said that the album 's lyrics are based on " that anonymous fear thing , sitting in traffic , thinking , ' I 'm sure I 'm supposed to be doing something else ' ... it 's similar to OK Computer in a way . It 's much more terrifying . " At the same time , Yorke felt " there 's very little anger in In Rainbows . It 's in no way political , or , at least , doesn 't feel that way to me . It very much explores the ideas of transience . It starts in one place and ends somewhere completely different . " In another interview , Yorke said the album was " about the fucking panic of realising you 're going to die ! And that any time soon [ I could ] possibly [ have ] a heart attack when I next go for a run . " 
 Ed O 'Brien described the lyrics , saying " They were universal . There wasn 't a political agenda . It 's being human . " The song " Bodysnatchers " is inspired by Victorian ghost stories , the 1972 novel The Stepford Wives and Yorke 's feeling of " your physical consciousness trapped without being able to connect fully with anything else . " " Jigsaw Falling into Place " is about a set of observations and different experiences , partly of the chaos witnessed by Yorke when he used to go out on the weekend in Oxford . Yorke said " The lyrics are quite caustic — the idea of ' before you 're comatose ' or whatever , drinking yourself into oblivion and getting fucked @-@ up to forget ... [ there ] is partly this elation . But there 's a much darker side . "

 The In Rainbows artwork was designed by Stanley Donwood , who has worked with Yorke in designing Radiohead 's album art since 1994 . Donwood worked in the studio as Radiohead were working on the album , which allowed the mood of the music to be conveyed in the album artwork , and regularly put up images in the studio and on the studio computer for the band to interact with and comment on . He also posted images daily on the band 's website , though none of the images were used in the final album artwork . Donwood experimented with a photographic etching technique , putting prints into acid baths with various results , and throwing wax at paper , creating images influenced by NASA 's space photographs . Donwood originally planned to explore suburban life , but realised it did not fit the album 's sound , saying " it 's a sensual record and I wanted to do something more organic . " Describing the album cover , Donwood said : " It 's very colourful — I 've finally embraced colour ! It 's a rainbow but it is very toxic , it 's more like the sort of one you 'd see in a puddle . " The band decided not to release the cover for the digital release of the album , preferring to hold it back for the physical release . The " discbox " release of the album includes a booklet containing additional artwork by Donwood .

 As Radiohead 's six @-@ album record contract with EMI ended after the 2003 release of Hail to the Thief , Radiohead recorded In Rainbows without a record contract . In 2005 , Yorke told Time : " I like the people at our record company , but the time is at hand when you have to ask why anyone needs one . And , yes , it probably would give us some perverse pleasure to say ' Fuck you ' to this decaying business model . " In 2006 , the New York Times described Radiohead as " by far the world 's most popular unsigned band " . 
 In August 2007 , as Radiohead were finishing In Rainbows , EMI was acquired by the private equity firm Terra Firma in a $ 6 @.@ 4 billion ( £ 4 @.@ 7 billion ) public @-@ to @-@ private buyout transaction . Radiohead were still negotiating with EMI , but were critical of the new Terra Firma management and no agreement was reached . O 'Brien said : " It was really sad to leave all the people [ we 'd worked with ] ... But Terra Firma don 't understand the music industry . " 
 On 1 October 2007 , Jonny Greenwood announced Radiohead 's seventh album on Radiohead 's blog , Dead Air Space , writing : " Well , the new album is finished , and it 's coming out in 10 days . . . We 've called it In Rainbows . " The post contained a link to inrainbows.com , where users could pre @-@ order an MP3 version of the album for any amount they wanted , including £ 0 — a landmark use of the pay @-@ what @-@ you @-@ want model for music sales . Colin Greenwood explained the internet release as a way of avoiding the " regulated playlists " and " straitened formats " of radio and TV , ensuring listeners around the world would experience the music at the same time , and preventing leaks in advance of a physical release . In a Wired interview with David Byrne , Yorke said : 
 We were trying to avoid that whole game of who gets in first with the reviews . These days there 's so much paper to fill , or digital paper to fill , that whoever writes the first few things gets cut and pasted . Whoever gets their opinion in first has all that power . Especially for a band like ours , it 's totally the luck of the draw whether that person is into us or not . It just seems wildly unfair , I think .

 The pay @-@ what @-@ you @-@ want release , the first for a major act , made headlines worldwide and sparked debate about the implications for the music industry . According to Mojo , the release was " hailed as a revolution in the way major bands sell their music " , and the media 's reaction was " almost overwhelmingly positive " . Time called it " easily the most important release in the recent history of the music business " and Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that " for the beleaguered recording business Radiohead has put in motion the most audacious experiment in years . " The NME wrote that " the music world seemed to <unk> several <unk> off its axis " , and praised the fact that everyone , from fans to critics , had access to the album at the same time on release day : " the kind of moment of togetherness you don ’ t get very often . " Singer Bono of U2 praised Radiohead as " courageous and imaginative in trying to figure out some new relationship with their audience " . 
 The release also drew criticism . Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails , who independently released his sixth album Ghosts I @-@ IV under a Creative Commons licence the following year , thought it did not go far enough , calling it " very much a bait and switch , to get you to pay for a MySpace quality stream as a way to promote a very traditional record sale . " Singer Lily Allen called it " arrogant " , saying : " [ Radiohead have ] millions of pounds . It sends a weird message to younger bands who haven 't done as well . You don 't choose how to pay for eggs . Why should it be different for music ? " In the Guardian , journalist Will Hodgkinson wrote : " Spare a thought for the thousands upon thousands of bands and singers who , nowhere near Radiohead 's levels of fame and fortune , now have pretty much no chance of ever making a living from their music . " Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth told the Guardian the release " seemed really community @-@ oriented , but it wasn 't catered towards their musician brothers and sisters , who don ’ t sell as many records as them . It makes everyone else look bad for not offering their music for whatever . " Radiohead 's managers defended the release as " a solution for Radiohead , not the industry " , and doubted " it would work the same way [ for Radiohead ] ever again . " Radiohead did not repeat the pay @-@ what @-@ you @-@ want release for subsequent releases .
