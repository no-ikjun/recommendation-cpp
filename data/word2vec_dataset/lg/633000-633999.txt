 Yasui had consulted a friend in the FBI prior to arrest , and consulted with other legal minds to try to test the legality of the orders . At trial he was defended by private attorney Earl Bernard . Gus J. Solomon , later a judge for the same court , had asked the national American Civil Liberties Union to defend Yasui as no local Oregon groups elected to support Yasui . One part of the strategy was to proceed with a non @-@ jury trial , leaving the decision only to the judge . Solomon was asked by Fee to help advise the court on the issues , along with eight other attorneys . At his trial , federal judge James Alger Fee came to the conclusion that laws specifically targeting a race , such as the curfew , were unconstitutional when applied to citizens . However , he also declared in his November 16 , 1942 , decision that Yasui had demonstrated his loyalty to Japan and was therefore no longer a U.S. citizen . Yasui was sentenced to one year in prison and given a $ 5000 fine . 
 Yasui waited nine months for his chance in court for appeal . During this time he was incarcerated at the Multnomah County Jail in Portland , and later sent to the Minidoka War Relocation Center in Idaho . When that chance finally came , the case went first to the Ninth Circuit briefly , but was then moved on to the Supreme Court . There the judges came to the conclusion that Yasui was still a U.S. citizen . After a few days on June 21 , 1943 , however , in Yasui v. United States , the court ruled unanimously that the government did have the authority to restrict the lives of civilian citizens during wartime , deciding the case as a companion case to Hirabayashi v. United States . Yasui was sent back to Fee , who removed the fine and decided that the time already served was enough of a punishment . Yasui was released and moved into the Japanese internment camps . 
 = = Later years = = 
 In 1944 , Yasui was allowed to leave the internment camp in the summer and was employed in Chicago before moving to Denver , Colorado , in September 1944 . There he passed the bar in June 1945 , but was only admitted to practice law after an appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court . The following year in November he married former internee True Shibata , and they would have three daughters together , Iris , Holly , and Laurel . 
 Living in Denver , Yasui became involved with community relations , serving on committee set up by the mayor , and later from 1959 to 1983 on the Commission on Community Relations . This commission dealt with race relations and other social issues , with Yasui as executive director from 1967 to 1983 . In 1954 , he was chairman of the Japanese American Citizens League ’ s ( JACL ) district covering Colorado , Wyoming , Texas , Nebraska , New Mexico , and Montana . The Minoru Yasui Community Service Award was started in 1974 by Denver community leaders , and is awarded annually to Denver area volunteers . 
 In 1976 , Yasui began working on the JACL ’ s committee concerning redress for the internment during World War II . He continued on that committee until 1984 , serving as its chairman in 1981 . He also filed in federal district court in Oregon a coram nobis to attempt to overturn his conviction in 1984 . His conviction was overturned by the Oregon federal court in 1986 . Minoru Yasui died on November 12 , 1986 , and is buried in his hometown of Hood River .

 The City and County of Denver owns an office building named after Yasui . Located at 303 West Colfax Avenue in Denver , the building is called Minoru Yasui Plaza , or the Minoru Yasui Building . A bronze bust of Yasui adorns the building 's foyer .

 Eric Peter Brewer ( born April 17 , 1979 ) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who is currently a free agent , having last played for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . He is an NHL All @-@ Star and Olympic gold medalist . 
 He began his career as a distinguished junior ice hockey player , named to the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) West Second All @-@ Star Team and the Western Conference roster for the 1998 WHL All @-@ Star Game ( although he missed the game due to injury ) . Drafted in the first round , fifth overall by the New York Islanders in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft , Brewer has spent parts of his fifteen @-@ year NHL career with the Islanders , the Edmonton Oilers , and the St. Louis Blues , the latter of which he captained for two years . He has also suited up for the Prince George Cougars of the WHL and the Lowell Lock Monsters of the American Hockey League ( AHL ) . In 1999 , Brewer was selected for the Prince George Cougars ' all @-@ time team in a Canadian Hockey League promotion . 
 Brewer has represented Canada at eight International Ice Hockey Federation @-@ sanctioned events , winning three Ice Hockey World Championships gold medals and one World Cup of Hockey gold medal . He won his Olympic gold medal during the 2002 Winter Olympics . For this accomplishment , he was inducted into the BC Sports Hall of Fame with his British Columbian teammates in 2003 . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Brewer was born on April 17 , 1979 , in Vernon , British Columbia , to Anna and Frank Brewer . He was raised in Ashcroft , British Columbia , and began playing ice hockey in the Ashcroft Minor Hockey program . When he was fourteen , his family moved to Kamloops , British Columbia , where he attended junior and senior high school . Brewer excelled with the Kamloops Bantam AAA Jardine Blazers of the British Columbia Amateur Hockey Association ( BCAHA ) . In 1995 , Brewer was exposed to BCAHA Best Ever , a program designed to find and develop players and coaches for play in international competition . As a young hockey player , Brewer looked up to NHL stars Scott Niedermayer and Jeremy Roenick as role models . 
 In mid @-@ 2004 , Brewer married Rebecca Flann , whom he met while playing junior hockey with the Prince George Cougars ; they live in Vancouver , British Columbia . Brewer 's sister , Kristi , played for the University of British Columbia Thunderbirds women 's ice hockey team . Eric and Rebecca have two daughters . 
 Brewer is involved in numerous charitable organizations . During the 2004 – 05 NHL lockout , Brewer participated in several charity hockey games , playing in the four @-@ game Ryan Smyth and Friends All @-@ Star Charity Tour , the three @-@ game Brad May and Friends Hockey Challenge , as well as the Our Game to Give charity hockey game held at Ivor Wynne Stadium in Hamilton , Ontario .

 = = = Prince George Cougars = = = 
 Brewer was drafted in the sixth round , 81st overall , by the Prince George Cougars in the 1994 WHL Bantam Draft . After being drafted , he played one final season with the Jardine Blazers , recording 38 points in only forty games . The following year , Brewer began his WHL career with the Cougars , playing 63 games in the 1995 – 96 season . Brewer finished his rookie WHL season with fourteen points , including four goals , and was named Cougars ' Rookie of the Year . 
 In his sophomore season , Brewer became a leader on the Cougars ' blue line . He was named to play for Team Orr in the 1997 CHL Top Prospects Game in February 1997 at Maple Leaf Gardens . He doubled his point total from the previous season , finishing with 29 points in 71 games played . Brewer followed his regular season by helping the Cougars go on a playoff run . After clinching the last spot in the West Division with a losing record , the Cougars defeated the number @-@ one seed Portland Winter Hawks in the conference quarterfinals and the third @-@ ranked Spokane Chiefs in the conference semifinals before finally losing to the second @-@ ranked Seattle Thunderbirds in the Western Conference final . Brewer finished this run with six points in the Cougars ' fifteen games . 
 Brewer 's final season with Prince George was his best , statistically , in the WHL . After representing Canada at the 1998 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships , he was named to the Western Conference team for the WHL All @-@ Star Game in Regina , Saskatchewan , which he missed , as well as much of the season , due to injury . However , Brewer finished the year with 33 points in only 34 games , a near one point @-@ per @-@ game average , and was named to the WHL West Second All @-@ Star Team . Brewer was the highest ranked defenceman at sixth overall among North American skaters heading into the 1997 NHL Entry Draft . He was drafted fifth overall by the New York Islanders in June 1997 . 
 = = = New York Islanders = = = 
 Just over a year after being drafted , Brewer signed his first professional contract with his draft team , the New York Islanders , in August 1998 . Entering the NHL , Brewer was regarded as a future Norris Trophy candidate , and as a result , his contract was an entry level three @-@ year , $ 2 @.@ 775 @-@ million deal complemented by a $ 1 @-@ million signing bonus , the highest base salary available for a rookie . Brewer made his NHL debut on October 10 , 1998 , against the Pittsburgh Penguins , and on November 5 , Brewer scored his first career goal against the Carolina Hurricanes ' Trevor Kidd . Throughout his rookie season , Brewer was considered an integral part of the Islanders ' defence , and , along with Zdeno Chára , Kenny <unk> and Roberto Luongo , was considered untouchable by management at the 1999 NHL trade deadline . Brewer finished his rookie season with eleven points in 63 games . 
 After playing just three games of the 1999 – 2000 NHL season , Brewer was assigned to the Islanders ' AHL affiliate , the Lowell Lock Monsters . It was speculated that the reason behind this move was laziness by Brewer , who was benched during the final thirty minutes by head coach Butch Goring after losing a race for the puck against Mike Knuble in the Islanders ' October 11 , 1999 , loss to the New York Rangers . Brewer also took a bad penalty earlier in the game , putting the Islanders down two men . After a two @-@ week , five @-@ game stint with the Lock Monsters , Brewer was subsequently recalled by the Islanders . After playing 26 games with the Islanders in which he only recorded two assists , Brewer was reassigned to the Lock Monsters on January 8 , 2000 , for the remainder of the season . Shortly after joining the Lock Monsters , Brewer suffered a sprained knee and missed the next two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half months of the season . Brewer went on to play 25 games for the Lock Monsters , recording two goals and two assists . He also participated in his first professional playoffs , as the Lock Monsters swept the Saint John Flames in three games in the first round , before being swept themselves in four games in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Providence Bruins . 
 = = = Edmonton Oilers = = = 
 At the 2000 NHL Entry Draft , the Islanders traded Brewer , Josh Green and their second round selection ( Brad Winchester ) in the same draft to the Edmonton Oilers for Roman Hamrlík . Although surprised to be traded , Brewer was excited at the prospect of playing for the Oilers , who saw Brewer as a top @-@ four defenceman . However , Brewer 's Oiler career began on a sour note as he suffered a bruised left hip and tailbone in his first game with the team . Brewer missed the next four games before returning to the lineup . Brewer scored his first goal as an Oiler on November 7 , 2000 , against the New York Rangers . Brewer finished his first Oiler season with career highs in goals , assists and points , as well as the best plus / minus rating on the Oilers team , a plus @-@ 15 . Further , Brewer gained his first NHL playoff experience , a quarterfinal series versus the Dallas Stars . Brewer had six points , but the Oilers were eliminated four games to two by the Stars . 
 The Oilers re @-@ signed Brewer , who was a free agent , to a one @-@ year , $ 907 @,@ 500 contract in August 2001 . In his second season with the Oilers , Brewer was assigned to play against the opposing teams ' best offensive players by Oilers head coach Craig MacTavish . Brewer began to play more minutes in games , typically placing among the NHL leaders in average minutes played per game . With this enhanced role on the team , Brewer finished his season with new career highs in assists and points for the second consecutive season , and matched his career high in goals . Although his single year contract expired , his role on the Oilers had become more important and Brewer expected a large raise for his third season with the Oilers . 
 After a long holdout that lasted until the beginning of Oilers training camp , Brewer finally signed a two @-@ year , $ 4 @-@ million contract in September 2002 . At the half of the 2002 – 03 NHL season , Brewer was named to play in his first NHL All @-@ Star Game , dressing for the Western Conference in the fifty @-@ third edition of the game . He finished with career highs for assists and points and set a career high for goals for the third consecutive season . He appeared in his second NHL playoffs , another quarterfinal series against the Dallas Stars in which the Oilers were once again eliminated four games to two . Brewer finished the playoffs with four points in the Oilers ' six games . 
 In his fourth season with the Oilers , Brewer continued his role as a top defenceman . On November 22 , 2003 , Brewer was among the participants in the historic 2003 Heritage Classic ice hockey game versus the Montreal Canadiens at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton . Brewer scored the Oilers first goal of the game in a 4 – 3 loss in front of a then record crowd of 57 @,@ 167 . Later in the season , in a game on January 29 , 2004 , versus the Chicago Blackhawks , Brewer recorded his one @-@ hundredth career point . Since his team depended on Brewer to play against the opposing teams ' best offensive players , he finished the season with an average time on ice of 24 : 39 , ranking fourteenth in the league . In the final year of his two @-@ year contract , Brewer finished the season with his point totals matching those from his 2001 – 02 NHL season , a slight fall from his career highs set in his third season with the Oilers . 
 With the Oilers unwilling to pay what he was expecting , Brewer decided to go to salary arbitration to get a new contract . However , on August 4 , 2004 , Brewer signed a one @-@ year , $ 2 @.@ 65 million contract with the Oilers , avoiding his arbitration hearing set for only a few days later . Brewer was unable to play out his new contract due to the 2004 – 05 NHL lockout . 
 = = = St. Louis Blues = = = 
 In August 2005 , following the lockout , the Oilers traded Brewer , Jeff <unk> and Doug Lynch to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for defenceman Chris Pronger . At the time of the trade , Brewer was a restricted free agent , so on August 15 , 2005 , Brewer accepted the Blues ' qualifying offer , signing a one @-@ year , $ 2 @-@ million contract . Brewer 's first season with the Blues was a particularly poor one . After playing the first 18 games of the season , Brewer separated his shoulder on November 16 , 2005 , in a 2 – 0 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets . Brewer missed ten games before being activated from the injured reserve list , returning to the St. Louis line @-@ up for a game on December 20 , 2005 , against the Phoenix Coyotes . Less than a month later , in a game on January 13 , 2006 , against the Atlanta Thrashers , Brewer collided with the Thrashers ' centre Karl Stewart , and dislocated his left shoulder , which ended his season . In just 32 games , Brewer finished his season with nine points , including six goals , two shy of his career best of eight set in the 2002 – 04 season . Despite his limited play , the Blues re @-@ signed Brewer to a one @-@ year , $ 2 @.@ 014 million contract for the 2006 – 07 season . 
 Brewer 's second season with the Blues began as a disappointment . By the first half of December 2006 , Brewer had only amassed six points and a plus @-@ minus rating of – 11 , often referred to as " the worst player on the ice " by both the media and Blues fans alike . Brewer was often involved in trade rumours , as he was set to become an unrestricted free agent following the completion of the season . Brewer believed his performance was the result of having only played in 32 NHL games since the 2003 – 04 season . However , after the firing of head coach Mike Kitchen on December 11 , 2006 , Brewer began playing much better under new head coach , Andy Murray . Over the next nineteen games , Brewer changed his – 11 into a + 2 and became an integral part of the Blues ' defence . His turnaround was rewarded on February 24 , 2007 , when , rather than being traded as was previously rumoured , Brewer signed a four @-@ year , $ 17 @-@ million contract extension with the Blues . Brewer continued his turnaround through the end of the season , finishing the year with six goals and 23 assists for 29 points , tying his career high for points set in the 2002 – 03 season and setting a new career high for assists . 
 In his third season with the Blues , Brewer continued to do well under Andy Murray . Brewer evolved into one of the top two @-@ way defencemen in the NHL , with comparisons being made between him and former first overall draft pick Chris Phillips of the Ottawa Senators . His play and leadership abilities were recognized , when on February 8 , 2008 , Brewer was named as the nineteenth captain in the history of the St. Louis Blues , filling the vacancy created when former Blues captain Dallas Drake had his contract bought out following the 2006 – 07 season . On February 17 , 2008 , in a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets , Brewer set a career high for points in a game with four , all assists , eclipsing his previous career high of three points set on January 16 , 2007 . Brewer finished the season with only one goal in his 77 games played , his lowest goal total since the 1999 – 2000 season , although he added 21 assists , three short of a career high . At the completion of the season , Brewer underwent reconstructive surgery on his right shoulder to repair damage suffered in a fight in the Blues ' season opening game against the Phoenix Coyotes on October 4 , 2007 .

 On February 18 , 2011 , Brewer was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning for Brock Beukeboom and Tampa Bay 's third @-@ round selection in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft .

 Throughout his career , Brewer has represented Canada at various international ice hockey tournaments . He first competed internationally as a member of Team Pacific Canada at the 1995 World U @-@ 17 Hockey Challenge in Moncton , New Brunswick . Three years later , he represented Canada as a whole as a member of the national junior team at the 1998 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships , where he was named an alternate captain . This was the tournament in which Canada had its worst ever showing , an eighth @-@ place finish including a loss to Kazakhstan , giving Brewer an unkind welcome to IIHF international ice hockey . Although eligible for the 1999 edition of the same tournament , Brewer was unable to play due to NHL commitments with the New York Islanders . 
 Brewer made his debut with the Canadian national men 's team on April 24 , 2001 , when he joined Canada for the 2001 Men 's World Ice Hockey Championships in Nuremberg , Cologne , and Hanover , Germany . Later that year , on July 24 , 2001 , Brewer was invited to the orientation camp for the Canadian team for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City , Utah . Five months later , on December 12 , 2001 , Brewer was named to the final Canadian roster for the tournament . In the opening game of the tournament against Sweden , Brewer scored Canada 's second goal of the game in a 5 – 2 loss , while in the semi @-@ finals of the tournament , Brewer scored the game @-@ winning goal against Belarus in a 7 – 1 victory , helping send Canada to the gold medal game against the host United States . Canada would go on to defeat the Americans by a score of 5 – 2 , winning their first Olympic gold medal in fifty years . 
 Shortly after his Olympic experience , Brewer was named to the Canadian roster for the 2002 Men 's World Ice Hockey Championships in Gothenburg , Karlstad and Jönköping , Sweden , his second consecutive Ice Hockey World Championships . He represented Canada once again the following year , when on April 22 , 2003 , Brewer was named to the Canadian roster for the 2003 Men 's World Ice Hockey Championships . In the tournament quarterfinals versus Germany , Brewer scored the game @-@ winning goal 37 seconds into overtime to give Canada a 3 – 2 victory . Canada would go on to win their first Ice Hockey World Championships gold medal since the 1997 tournament , defeating Sweden 3 – 2 in overtime in the final . Brewer once again participated for Canada at the 2004 Men 's World Ice Hockey Championships , his fourth consecutive Ice Hockey World Championships , where he helped Canada win its second consecutive championship after defeating Sweden 5 – 3 in the gold medal game . 
 On May 15 , 2004 , Brewer was named to the Canadian roster for the 2004 World Cup of Hockey . In the semifinal of the tournament , Brewer scored Canada 's first goal of the game in 4 – 3 overtime victory against the Czech Republic . Team Canada would go on to win the tournament on home ice in Toronto , defeating Finland 3 – 2 in the final . Just under one year following his World Cup appearance , Brewer was named to the orientation camp for the Canadian team at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin , Italy held from August 15 – 20 , 2005 , in Vancouver and Kelowna , British Columbia . Following the camp , on October 18 , 2005 , Brewer was named to the preliminary 81 @-@ man Canadian roster for the tournament . However , when the final roster was announced on December 21 , 2005 , Brewer was not among the 26 players listed . As a result , it would be nearly three years before Brewer would next suit up for his country , when on April 3 , 2007 , Brewer was among the first five players named to play for Canada at the 2007 IIHF World Championship in Moscow and <unk> , Russia . For the tournament , Brewer was named as the team 's only permanent alternate captain and helped the team to its third gold medal at the tournament in the past five years .

 = Epilepsy = 
 Epilepsy is a group of neurological diseases characterized by epileptic seizures . Epileptic seizures are episodes that can vary from brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking . These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones . In epilepsy , seizures tend to recur , and have no immediate underlying cause . Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy . People with epilepsy in some areas of the world experience stigma due to the condition . 
 The cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown , although some people develop epilepsy as the result of brain injury , stroke , brain tumors , infections of the brain , and birth defects . Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases . Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain . The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems . This may be partly done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests . Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , but a normal test does not rule out the condition . 
 Epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues can be prevented . Seizures are controllable with medication in about 70 % of cases . Inexpensive options are often available . In those whose seizures do not respond to medication , then surgery , <unk> , or dietary changes may be considered . Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong , and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed . 
 As of 2013 about 22 million people have epilepsy . Nearly 80 % of cases occur in the developing world . In 2013 it resulted in 116 @,@ 000 deaths up from 112 @,@ 000 deaths in 1990 . Epilepsy becomes more common as people age . In the developed world , onset of new cases occurs most frequently in babies and the elderly . In the developing world onset is more common in older children and young adults , due to differences in the frequency of the underlying causes . About 5 – 10 % of people will have an unprovoked seizure by the age of 80 , and the chance of experiencing a second seizure is between 40 and 50 % . In many areas of the world those with epilepsy either have restrictions placed on their ability to drive or are not permitted to drive until they are free of seizures for a specific length of time . The word epilepsy is from Ancient Greek : <unk> " to seize , possess , or afflict " . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Epilepsy is characterized by a long @-@ term risk of recurrent seizures . These seizures may present in several ways depending on the part of the brain involved and the person 's age . 
 = = = Seizures = = = 
 The most common type ( 60 % ) of seizures are convulsive . Of these , one @-@ third begin as generalized seizures from the start , affecting both hemispheres of the brain . Two @-@ thirds begin as partial seizures ( which affect one hemisphere of the brain ) which may then progress to generalized seizures . The remaining 40 % of seizures are non @-@ convulsive . An example of this type is the absence seizure , which presents as a decreased level of consciousness and usually lasts about 10 seconds . 
 Partial seizures are often preceded by certain experiences , known as auras . They include sensory ( visual , hearing , or smell ) , psychic , autonomic , and motor phenomena . <unk> activity may start in a specific muscle group and spread to surrounding muscle groups in which case it is known as a Jacksonian march . <unk> may occur , which are non @-@ consciously @-@ generated activities and mostly simple repetitive movements like smacking of the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick up something . 
 There are six main types of generalized seizures : tonic @-@ clonic , tonic , clonic , myoclonic , absence , and atonic seizures . They all involve loss of consciousness and typically happen without warning . 
 Tonic @-@ clonic seizures occur with a contraction of the limbs followed by their extension along with arching of the back which lasts 10 – 30 seconds ( the tonic phase ) . A cry may be heard due to contraction of the chest muscles , followed by a shaking of the limbs in unison ( clonic phase ) . Tonic seizures produce constant contractions of the muscles . A person often turns blue as breathing is stopped . In clonic seizures there is shaking of the limbs in unison . After the shaking has stopped it may take 10 – 30 minutes for the person to return to normal ; this period is called the " postictal state " or " postictal phase . " Loss of bowel or bladder control may occur during a seizure . The tongue may be bitten at either the tip or on the sides during a seizure . In tonic @-@ clonic seizure , bites to the sides are more common . Tongue bites are also relatively common in psychogenic non @-@ epileptic seizures . 
 <unk> seizures involve spasms of muscles in either a few areas or all over . Absence seizures can be subtle with only a slight turn of the head or eye blinking . The person does not fall over and returns to normal right after it ends . <unk> seizures involve the loss of muscle activity for greater than one second . This typically occurs on both sides of the body . 
 About 6 % of those with epilepsy have seizures that are often triggered by specific events and are known as reflex seizures . Those with reflex epilepsy have seizures that are only triggered by specific stimuli . Common triggers include flashing lights and sudden noises . In certain types of epilepsy , seizures happen more often during sleep , and in other types they occur almost only when sleeping . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 After the active portion of a seizure , there is typically a period of confusion referred to as the postictal period before a normal level of consciousness returns . It usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes but may last for hours . Other common symptoms include feeling tired , headache , difficulty speaking , and abnormal behavior . Psychosis after a seizure is relatively common , occurring in 6 – 10 % of people . Often people do not remember what happened during this time . Localized weakness , known as Todd 's paralysis , may also occur after a partial seizure . When it occurs it typically lasts for seconds to minutes but may rarely last for a day or two . 
 = = = Psychosocial = = = 
 Epilepsy can have adverse effects on social and psychological well @-@ being . These effects may include social isolation , stigmatization , or disability . They may result in lower educational achievement and worse employment outcomes . Learning disabilities are common in those with the condition , and especially among children with epilepsy . The stigma of epilepsy can also affect the families of those with the disorder . 
 Certain disorders occur more often in people with epilepsy , depending partly on the epilepsy syndrome present . These include depression , anxiety , obsessive – compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , and migraine . Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affects three to five times more children with epilepsy than children without the condition . ADHD and epilepsy have significant consequences on a child 's behavioral , learning , and social development . Epilepsy is also more common in children with autism . 
 = = Causes = = 
 Epilepsy can have both genetic and acquired causes , with interaction of these factors in many cases . Established acquired causes include serious brain trauma , stroke , tumours and problems in the brain as a result of a previous infection . In about 60 % of cases the cause is unknown . <unk> caused by genetic , congenital , or developmental conditions are more common among younger people , while brain tumors and strokes are more likely in older people . 
 Seizures may also occur as a consequence of other health problems ; if they occur right around a specific cause , such as a stroke , head injury , toxic ingestion or metabolic problem , they are known as acute symptomatic seizures and are in the broader classification of seizure @-@ related disorders rather than epilepsy itself .

 Genetics is believed to be involved in the majority of cases , either directly or indirectly . Some epilepsies are due to a single gene defect ( 1 – 2 % ) ; most are due to the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors . Each of the single gene defects is rare , with more than 200 in all described . Most genes involved affect ion channels , either directly or indirectly . These include genes for ion channels themselves , enzymes , GABA , and G protein @-@ coupled receptors . 
 In identical twins , if one is affected there is a 50 – 60 % chance that the other will also be affected . In non @-@ identical twins the risk is 15 % . These risks are greater in those with generalized rather than partial seizures . If both twins are affected , most of the time they have the same epileptic syndrome ( 70 – 90 % ) . Other close relatives of a person with epilepsy have a risk five times that of the general population . Between 1 and 10 % of those with Down syndrome and 90 % of those with Angelman syndrome have epilepsy . 
 = = = Acquired = = = 
 Epilepsy may occur as a result of a number of other conditions including tumors , strokes , head trauma , previous infections of the central nervous system , genetic abnormalities , and as a result of brain damage around the time of birth . Of those with brain tumors , almost 30 % have epilepsy , making them the cause of about 4 % of cases . The risk is greatest for tumors in the temporal lobe and those that grow slowly . Other mass lesions such as cerebral cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations have risks as high as 40 – 60 % . Of those who have had a stroke , 2 – 4 % develop epilepsy . In the United Kingdom strokes account for 15 % of cases and it is believed to be the cause in 30 % of the elderly . Between 6 and 20 % of epilepsy is believed to be due to head trauma . Mild brain injury increases the risk about two @-@ fold while severe brain injury increases the risk seven @-@ fold . In those who have experienced a high @-@ powered gunshot wound to the head , the risk is about 50 % . 
 Some evidence links epilepsy and coeliac disease and non @-@ celiac gluten sensitivity , while other evidence does not . There appears to be a specific syndrome which includes coeliac disease , epilepsy and calcifications in the brain . A 2012 review estimates that between 1 % and 6 % of people with epilepsy have CD while 1 % of the general population has the condition . 
 The risk of epilepsy following meningitis is less than 10 % ; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself . In herpes simplex encephalitis the risk of a seizure is around 50 % with a high risk of epilepsy following ( up to 25 % ) . Infection with the pork tapeworm , which can result in neurocysticercosis , is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common . Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria , toxoplasmosis , and toxocariasis . Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy : those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase in risk . Other risks include Alzheimer 's disease , multiple sclerosis , tuberous sclerosis , and autoimmune encephalitis . Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy . Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world , although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association . People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy , with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the disease . 
 = = Mechanism = = 
 Normally brain electrical activity is non @-@ synchronous . Its activity is regulated by various factors both within the neuron and the cellular environment . Factors within the neuron include the type , number and distribution of ion channels , changes to receptors and changes of gene expression . Factors around the neuron include ion concentrations , synaptic plasticity and regulation of transmitter breakdown by glial cells . 
 = = = Epilepsy = = = 
 The exact mechanism of epilepsy itself is unknown . A little , however , is known about both the cellular and network mechanisms of epilepsy . However , it is unknown under which circumstances the brain shifts into the activity of a seizure with its excessive synchronization . 
 In epilepsy , the resistance of excitatory neurons to fire during this period is decreased . This may occur due to changes in ion channels or inhibitory neurons not functioning properly . This then results in a specific area from which seizures may develop , known as a " seizure focus " . Another mechanism of epilepsy may be the up @-@ regulation of excitatory circuits or down @-@ regulation of inhibitory circuits following an injury to the brain . These secondary epilepsies occur through processes known as epileptogenesis . Failure of the blood – brain barrier may also be a causal mechanism as it would allow substances in the blood to enter the brain . 
 = = = Seizures = = = 
 There is evidence that epileptic seizures are usually not a random event . Seizures are often brought on by factors such as stress , alcohol abuse , flickering light , or a lack of sleep , among others . The term seizure threshold is used to indicate the amount of stimulus necessary to bring about a seizure . Seizure threshold is lowered in epilepsy . 
 In epileptic seizures a group of neurons begin firing in an abnormal , excessive , and synchronized manner . This results in a wave of depolarization known as a paroxysmal <unk> shift . Normally , after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time . This is due in part to the effect of inhibitory neurons , electrical changes within the excitatory neuron , and the negative effects of adenosine . 
 Partial seizures begin in one hemisphere of the brain while generalized seizures begin in both hemispheres . Some types of seizures may change brain structure , while others appear to have little effect . <unk> , neuronal loss , and atrophy of specific areas of the brain are linked to epilepsy but it is unclear if epilepsy causes these changes or if these changes result in epilepsy . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 The diagnosis of epilepsy is typically made based on observation of the seizure onset and the underlying cause . An electroencephalogram ( EEG ) to look for abnormal patterns of brain waves and neuroimaging ( CT scan or MRI ) to look at the structure of the brain are also usually part of the workup . While figuring out a specific epileptic syndrome is often attempted , it is not always possible . Video and EEG monitoring may be useful in difficult cases . 
 = = = Definition = = = 
 Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain defined by any of the following conditions : 
 Furthermore , epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who had an age @-@ dependent epilepsy syndrome but are now past that age or those who have remained seizure @-@ free for the last 10 years , with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years . 
 This 2014 definition of the International League Against Epilepsy is a clarification of the ILAE 2005 conceptual definition , according to which epilepsy is " a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the <unk> , cognitive , psychological , and social consequences of this condition . The definition of epilepsy requires the occurrence of at least one epileptic seizure . " 
 It is , therefore , possible to outgrow epilepsy or to undergo treatment that causes epilepsy to be resolved . Resolution of epilepsy , unfortunately , does not guarantee that it will not return . In the definition , epilepsy is now called a disease , rather than a disorder . This was a decision of the executive committee of the ILAE , taken because the word " disorder , " while perhaps having less stigma than does " disease , " also does not express the degree of seriousness that epilepsy deserves . 
 The definition is practical in nature and is designed for clinical use . In particular , it aims to clarify when an " enduring predisposition " according to the 2005 conceptual definition is present . Researchers , statistically @-@ minded epidemiologists , and other specialized groups may choose to use the older definition or a definition of their own devising . The ILAE considers doing so is perfectly allowable , so long as it is clear what definition is being used . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 In contrast to the classification of seizures which focuses on what happens during a seizure , the classification of epilepsies focuses on the underlying causes . When a person is admitted to hospital after an epileptic seizure the diagnostic workup results preferably in the seizure itself being classified ( e.g. tonic @-@ clonic ) and in the underlying disease being identified ( e.g. hippocampal sclerosis ) . The name of the diagnosis finally made depends on the available diagnostic results and the applied definitions and classifications ( of seizures and epilepsies ) and its respective terminology . 
 The International League Against Epilepsy ( ILAE ) provided a classification of the epilepsies and epileptic syndromes in 1989 as follows : 
 This classification was widely accepted but has also been criticized mainly because the underlying causes of epilepsy ( which are a major determinant of clinical course and prognosis ) were not covered in detail . In 2010 the ILAE Commission for Classification of the <unk> addressed this issue and divided epilepsies into three categories ( genetic , structural / metabolic , unknown cause ) that were refined in their 2011 recommendation into four categories and a number of subcategories reflecting recent <unk> and scientific advances . 
 = = = Syndromes = = = 
 Cases of epilepsy may be organized into epilepsy syndromes by the specific features that are present . These features include the age that seizure begin , the seizure types , EEG findings , among others . Identifying an epilepsy syndrome is useful as it helps determine the underlying causes as well as what anti @-@ seizure medication should be tried . 
 The ability to categorize a case of epilepsy into a specific syndrome occurs more often with children since the onset of seizures is commonly early . Less serious examples are benign <unk> epilepsy ( 2 @.@ 8 per 100 @,@ 000 ) , childhood absence epilepsy ( 0 @.@ 8 per 100 @,@ 000 ) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy ( 0 @.@ 7 per 100 @,@ 000 ) . Severe syndromes with diffuse brain dysfunction caused , at least partly , by some aspect of epilepsy , are also referred to as epileptic encephalopathies . These are associated with frequent seizures that are resistant to treatment and severe cognitive dysfunction , for instance Lennox – Gastaut syndrome and West syndrome . Genetics is believed to play an important role in epilepsies by a number of mechanisms . Simple and complex modes of inheritance have been identified for some of them . However , extensive screening have failed to identify many single gene variants of large effect . More recent <unk> and genome sequencing studies have begun to reveal a number of de novo gene mutations that are responsible for some epileptic encephalopathies , including <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 Syndromes in which causes are not clearly identified are difficult to match with categories of the current classification of epilepsy . Categorization for these cases was made somewhat arbitrarily . The idiopathic ( unknown cause ) category of the 2011 classification includes syndromes in which the general clinical features and / or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause . Some childhood epilepsy syndromes are included in the unknown cause category in which the cause is presumed genetic , for instance benign <unk> epilepsy . Others are included in symptomatic despite a presumed genetic cause ( in at least in some cases ) , for instance Lennox @-@ Gastaut syndrome . Clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature ( e.g. Angelman syndrome ) were categorized symptomatic but it was argued to include these within the category idiopathic . Classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research . 
 = = = Tests = = = 
 An electroencephalogram ( EEG ) can assist in showing brain activity suggestive of an increased risk of seizures . It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms . In the diagnosis of epilepsy , electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present . In children it is typically only needed after a second seizure . It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis , and may be falsely positive in those without the disease . In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived . 
 Diagnostic imaging by CT scan and MRI is recommended after a first non @-@ febrile seizure to detect structural problems in and around the brain . MRI is generally a better imaging test except when bleeding is suspected , for which CT is more sensitive and more easily available . If someone attends the emergency room with a seizure but returns to normal quickly , imaging tests may be done at a later point . If a person has a previous diagnosis of epilepsy with previous imaging , repeating the imaging is usually not needed even if there are subsequent seizures . 
 For adults , the testing of electrolyte , blood glucose and calcium levels is important to rule out problems with these as causes . An electrocardiogram can rule out problems with the rhythm of the heart . A lumbar puncture may be useful to diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not routinely needed . In children additional tests may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders . 
 A high blood prolactin level within the first 20 minutes following a seizure may be useful to help confirm an epileptic seizure as opposed to psychogenic non @-@ epileptic seizure . Serum prolactin level is less useful for detecting partial seizures . If it is normal an epileptic seizure is still possible and a serum prolactin does not separate epileptic seizures from syncope . It is not recommended as a routine part of the diagnosis of epilepsy . 
 = = = Differential diagnosis = = = 
 Diagnosis of epilepsy can be difficult . A number of other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures , including syncope , hyperventilation , migraines , narcolepsy , panic attacks and psychogenic non @-@ epileptic seizures ( PNES ) . In particular a syncope can be accompanied by a short episode of convulsions . Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy , often misdiagnosed as nightmares , was considered to be a <unk> but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome . Attacks of the movement disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures . The cause of a drop attack can be , among many others , an atonic seizure . 
 Children may have behaviors that are easily mistaken for epileptic seizures but are not . These include breath @-@ holding spells , bed wetting , night terrors , tics and shudder attacks . <unk> reflux may cause arching of the back and twisting of the head to the side in infants , which may be mistaken for tonic @-@ clonic seizures . 
 <unk> is frequent ( occurring in about 5 to 30 % of cases ) . Different studies showed that in many cases seizure @-@ like attacks in apparent treatment @-@ resistant epilepsy have a cardiovascular cause . Approximately 20 % of the people seen at epilepsy clinics have PNES and of those who have PNES about 10 % also have epilepsy ; separating the two based on the seizure episode alone without further testing is often difficult . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 While many cases are not preventable , efforts to reduce head injuries , provide good care around the time of birth , and reduce environmental parasites such as the pork tapeworm may be effective . Efforts in one part of Central America to decrease rates of pork tapeworm resulted in a 50 % decrease in new cases of epilepsy . 
 = = Management = = 
 Epilepsy is usually treated with daily medication once a second seizure has occurred , but for those at high risk , medication may be started after the first seizure . In some cases , a special diet , the implantation of a <unk> , or neurosurgery may be required . 
 = = = First aid = = = 
 Rolling a person with an active tonic @-@ clonic seizure onto their side and into the recovery position helps prevent fluids from getting into the lungs . Putting fingers , a bite block or tongue depressor in the mouth is not recommended as it might make the person vomit or result in the rescuer being bitten . Efforts should be taken to prevent further self @-@ injury . Spinal precautions are generally not needed . 
 If a seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes or if there are more than two seizures in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them , it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus . This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected ; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this . At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth . Diazepam may also be used rectally . In hospital , intravenous lorazepam is preferred . If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective , other medications such as phenytoin are recommended . <unk> status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as <unk> or propofol . 
 = = = Medications = = = 
 The mainstay treatment of epilepsy is anticonvulsant medications , possibly for the person 's entire life . The choice of anticonvulsant is based on seizure type , epilepsy syndrome , other medications used , other health problems , and the person 's age and lifestyle . A single medication is recommended initially ; if this is not effective , switching to a single other medication is recommended . Two medications at once is recommended only if a single medication does not work . In about half , the first agent is effective ; a second single agent helps in about 13 % and a third or two agents at the same time may help an additional 4 % . About 30 % of people continue to have seizures despite anticonvulsant treatment . 
 There are a number of medications available . <unk> , carbamazepine and valproate appear to be equally effective in both partial and generalized seizures . Controlled release carbamazepine appears to work as well as immediate release carbamazepine , and may have fewer side effects . In the United Kingdom , carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first @-@ line treatment for partial seizures , with levetiracetam and valproate as second @-@ line due to issues of cost and side effects . <unk> is recommended first @-@ line for generalized seizures with lamotrigine being second @-@ line . In those with absence seizures , <unk> or valproate are recommended ; valproate is particularly effective in myoclonic seizures and tonic or atonic seizures . If seizures are well @-@ controlled on a particular treatment , it is not usually necessary to routinely check the medication levels in the blood . 
 The least expensive anticonvulsant is phenobarbital at around $ 5 USD a year . The World Health Organization gives it a first @-@ line recommendation in the developing world and it is commonly used there . Access however may be difficult as some countries label it as a controlled drug . 
 Adverse effects from medications are reported in 10 to 90 % of people , depending on how and from whom the data is collected . Most adverse effects are dose @-@ related and mild . Some examples include mood changes , sleepiness , or an unsteadiness in gait . Certain medications have side effects that are not related to dose such as rashes , liver toxicity , or suppression of the bone marrow . Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects . Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy . <unk> is of particular concern , especially during the first trimester . Despite this , treatment is often continued once effective , because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications . 
 Slowly stopping medications may be reasonable in some people who do not have a seizure for two to four years ; however , around a third of people have a recurrence , most often during the first six months . Stopping is possible in about 70 % of children and 60 % of adults . 
 = = = Surgery = = = 
 Epilepsy surgery may be an option for people with partial seizures that remain a problem despite other treatments . These other treatments include at least a trial of two or three medications . The goal of surgery is total control of seizures and this may be achieved in 60 – 70 % of cases . Common procedures include cutting out the hippocampus via an anterior temporal lobe resection , removal of tumors , and removing parts of the neocortex . Some procedures such as a corpus <unk> are attempted in an effort to decrease the number of seizures rather than cure the condition . Following surgery , medications may be slowly withdrawn in many cases . 
 <unk> may be another option in those who are not candidates for surgery . Three types have been shown to be effective in those who do not respond to medications : vagus nerve stimulation , anterior thalamic stimulation , and closed @-@ loop responsive stimulation . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 A ketogenic diet ( high @-@ fat , low @-@ carbohydrate , adequate @-@ protein ) appears to decrease the number of seizures by half in about 30 – 40 % of children . It is a reasonable option in those who have epilepsy that is not improved with medications and for whom surgery is not an option . About 10 % stay on the diet for a few years due to issues of effectiveness and tolerability . Side effects include stomach and intestinal problems in 30 % , and there are long term concerns of heart disease . Less radical diets are easier to tolerate and may be effective . It is unclear why this diet works . Exercise has been proposed as possibly useful for preventing seizures with some data to support this claim . 
 In people with coeliac disease or non @-@ celiac gluten sensitivity and occipital calcifications , a gluten @-@ free diet may decrease the frequency of seizures . 
 = = = Other = = = 
 Avoidance therapy consists of minimizing or eliminating triggers . For example , in those who are sensitive to light , using a small television , avoiding video games , or wearing dark glasses may be useful . Operant @-@ based biofeedback based on the EEG waves has some support in those who do not respond to medications . Psychological methods should not , however , be used to replace medications . Some dogs , commonly referred to as seizure dogs , may help during or after a seizure . It is not clear if dogs have the ability to predict seizures before they occur . 
 = = = Alternative medicine = = = 
 Alternative medicine , including acupuncture , psychological interventions , routine vitamins , and yoga , have no reliable evidence to support their use in epilepsy . There is not enough evidence to support the use of cannabis . Melatonin , as of 2016 , is insufficiently supported by evidence . The trials were of poor methodological quality and it was not possible to draw any definitive conclusions . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Epilepsy cannot usually be cured , but medication can control seizures effectively in about 70 % of cases . Of those with generalized seizures , more than 80 % can be well controlled with medications while this is true in only 50 % of people with partial seizures . One predictor of long @-@ term outcome is the number of seizures that occur in the first six months . Other factors increasing the risk of a poor outcome include little response to the initial treatment , generalized seizures , a family history of epilepsy , psychiatric problems , and waves on the EEG representing generalized epileptiform activity . In the developing world , 75 % of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated . In Africa , 90 % do not get treatment . This is partly related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive . 
 = = = Mortality = = = 
 People with epilepsy are at an increased risk of death . This increase is between 1 @.@ 6 and 4 @.@ 1 fold greater than that of the general population and is often related to : the underlying cause of the seizures , status epilepticus , suicide , trauma , and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy ( <unk> ) . Death from status epilepticus is primarily due to an underlying problem rather than missing doses of medications . The risk of suicide is increased between two and six times in those with epilepsy . The cause of this is unclear . <unk> appears to be partly related to the frequency of generalized tonic @-@ clonic seizures and accounts for about 15 % of epilepsy related deaths . It is unclear how to decrease its risk . The greatest increase in mortality from epilepsy is among the elderly . Those with epilepsy due to an unknown cause have little increased risk . In the United Kingdom , it is estimated that 40 – 60 % of deaths are possibly preventable . In the developing world , many deaths are due to untreated epilepsy leading to falls or status epilepticus . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Epilepsy is one of the most common serious neurological disorders affecting about 22 million people as of 2013 . It affects 1 % of the population by age 20 and 3 % of the population by age 75 . It is more common in males than females with the overall difference being small . Most of those with the disorder ( 80 % ) are in the developing world . 
 The estimated prevalence of active epilepsy ( as of 2012 ) is in the range 3 – 10 per 1 @,@ 000 , with active epilepsy defined as someone with epilepsy who has had a least one unprovoked seizure in the last five years . Epilepsy begins each year in 40 – 70 per 100 @,@ 000 in developed countries and 80 – 140 per 100 @,@ 000 in developing countries . Poverty is a risk and includes both being from a poor country and being poor relative to others within one 's country . In the developed world epilepsy most commonly starts either in the young or in the old . In the developing world its onset is more common in older children and young adults due to the higher rates of trauma and infectious diseases . In developed countries the number of cases a year has decreased in children and increased among the elderly between the 1970s and 2003 . This has been attributed partly to better survival following strokes in the elderly . 
 = = History = = 
 The oldest medical records show that epilepsy has been affecting people at least since the beginning of recorded history . Throughout ancient history , the disease was thought to be a spiritual condition . The world 's oldest description of an epileptic seizure comes from a text in Akkadian ( a language used in ancient Mesopotamia ) and was written around 2000 BC . The person described in the text was diagnosed as being under the influence of a Moon god , and underwent an exorcism . Epileptic seizures are listed in the Code of Hammurabi ( c . 1790 BC ) as reason for which a purchased slave may be returned for a refund , and the Edwin Smith Papyrus ( c . 1700 BC ) describes cases of individuals with epileptic convulsions . 
 The oldest known detailed record of the disease itself is in the <unk> , a Babylonian cuneiform medical text from 1067 – 1046 BC . This text gives signs and symptoms , details treatment and likely outcomes , and describes many features of the different seizure types . As the Babylonians had no biomedical understanding of the nature of disease , they attributed the seizures to possession by evil spirits and called for treating the condition through spiritual means . Around 900 BC , <unk> <unk> described epilepsy as loss of consciousness ; this definition was carried forward into the Ayurvedic text of Charaka Samhita ( about 400 BC ) . 
 The ancient Greeks had contradictory views of the disease . They thought of epilepsy as a form of spiritual possession , but also associated the condition with genius and the divine . One of the names they gave to it was the sacred disease . Epilepsy appears within Greek mythology : it is associated with the Moon goddesses Selene and Artemis , who afflicted those who upset them . The Greeks thought that important figures such as Julius Caesar and Hercules had the disease . The notable exception to this divine and spiritual view was that of the school of Hippocrates . In the fifth century BC , Hippocrates rejected the idea that the disease was caused by spirits . In his landmark work On the Sacred Disease , he proposed that epilepsy was not divine in origin and instead was a medically treatable problem originating in the brain . He accused those of attributing a sacred cause to the disease of spreading ignorance through a belief in superstitious magic . Hippocrates proposed that heredity was important as a cause , described worse outcomes if the disease presents at an early age , and made note of the physical characteristics as well as the social shame associated with it . Instead of referring to it as the sacred disease , he used the term great disease , giving rise to the modern term grand mal , used for tonic – clonic seizures . Despite his work detailing the physical origins of the disease , his view was not accepted at the time . Evil spirits continued to be blamed until at least the 17th century . 
 In most cultures , persons with epilepsy have been stigmatized , shunned , or even imprisoned ; in the Salpêtrière , the birthplace of modern neurology , Jean @-@ Martin Charcot found people with epilepsy side @-@ by @-@ side with the mentally ill , those with chronic syphilis , and the criminally insane . In ancient Rome , epilepsy was known as the <unk> <unk> ( ' disease of the assembly hall ' ) and was seen as a curse from the gods . In northern Italy , epilepsy was once traditionally known as Saint Valentine 's malady . 
 In the mid @-@ 1800s , the first effective anti @-@ seizure medication , bromide , was introduced . The first modern treatment , phenobarbital , was developed in 1912 , with phenytoin coming into use in 1938 . 
 = = Society and culture = = 
 = = = Stigma = = = 
 Stigma is commonly experienced , around the world , by those with epilepsy . It can affect people economically , socially and culturally . In India and China , epilepsy may be used as justification to deny marriage . People in some areas still believe those with epilepsy to be cursed . In Tanzania , as in other parts of Africa , epilepsy is associated with possession by evil spirits , witchcraft , or poisoning and is believed by many to be contagious , for which there is no evidence . Before 1970 the United Kingdom had laws which prevented people with epilepsy from marrying . The stigma may result in some people with epilepsy denying that they have ever had seizures . 
 = = = Economics = = = 
 Seizures result in direct economic costs of about one billion dollars in the United States . Epilepsy resulted in economic costs in Europe of around 15 @.@ 5 billion Euros in 2004 . In India epilepsy is estimated to result in costs of 1 @.@ 7 billion USD or 0 @.@ 5 % of the GDP . It is the cause of about 1 % of emergency department visits ( 2 % for emergency departments for children ) in the United States . 
 = = = Vehicles = = = 
 Those with epilepsy are at about twice the risk of being involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus in many areas of the world are not allowed to drive or only able to drive if certain conditions are met . In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves . Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden , Austria , Denmark and Spain . Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand and the physician may report if they believe the individual has not already . In Canada , the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state . If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable . The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country . Many countries require one to three years without seizures . In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year . 
 Those with epilepsy or seizures are typically denied a pilot license . In Canada if an individual has had no more than one seizure , they may be considered after five years for a limited license if all other testing is normal . Those with febrile seizures and drug related seizures may also be considered . In the United States , the Federal Aviation Administration does not allow those with epilepsy to get a commercial pilot license . Rarely , exceptions can be made for persons who have had an isolated seizure or febrile seizures and have remained free of seizures into adulthood without medication . In the United Kingdom , a full national private pilot license requires the same standards as a professional driver 's license . This requires a period of ten years without seizures while off medications . Those who do not meet this requirement may acquire a restricted license if free from seizures for five years . 
 = = = Support organizations = = = 
 There are organizations that provide support for people and families affected by epilepsy . The Out of the Shadows campaign , a joint effort by the World Health Organization , the International League Against Epilepsy and the International Bureau for Epilepsy , provides help internationally . The Joint Epilepsy Council serves the UK and Ireland . In the United States , the Epilepsy Foundation is a national organization that works to increase the acceptance of those with the disease , their ability to function in society and to promote research for a cure . The Epilepsy Foundation , some hospitals , and some individuals also run support groups in the United States . 
 = = Research = = 
 Seizure prediction refers to attempts to forecast epileptic seizures based on the EEG before they occur . As of 2011 , no effective mechanism to predict seizures has been developed . Kindling , where repeated exposures to events that could cause seizures eventually causes seizures more easily , has been used to create animal models of epilepsy . 
 Gene therapy is being studied in some types of epilepsy . Medications that alter immune function , such as intravenous immunoglobulins , are poorly supported by evidence . Noninvasive stereotactic <unk> is , as of 2012 , being compared to standard surgery for certain types of epilepsy . 
 Common locations for the start of seizures and neural networks have been found to be affected in the majority of epilepsy . Efforts to figure out how epilepsy occurs is working to take into account the different regions of the brain and the timing of their activity . 
 = = Other animals = = 
 Epilepsy occurs in a number of other animals including dogs and cats and is the most common brain disorder in dogs . It is typically treated with anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital or bromide in dogs and phenobarbital in cats . <unk> is also used in dogs . While generalized seizures in horses are fairly easy to diagnose , it may be more difficult in non @-@ generalized seizures and EEGs may be useful . 
 = Rather Ripped = 
 Rather Ripped is the 14th studio album by the American experimental rock band Sonic Youth , released on June 13 , 2006 by Geffen Records . It is the band 's first album after the departure of multi @-@ instrumentalist Jim O 'Rourke , who joined the group as a fifth member in 1999 . Unlike its immediate predecessors , the album was produced by John Agnello and recorded at Sear Sound in New York City , the same studio where the band 's 1994 album Experimental Jet Set , Trash and No Star was recorded . It also completed Sonic Youth 's contract with Geffen , which released the band 's previous eight records . 
 Rather Ripped is generally considered one of the band 's most accessible albums , featuring an abundance of concise and catchy songs that deal with melancholic topics about adultery , sexual frustration and infidelity . Upon release , the album peaked at No. 71 on the US Billboard 200 chart and No. 64 on the UK Albums Chart . The album 's only single , " Incinerate " , was released in 2006 , alongside an accompanying music video by French director and writer Claire Denis . Rather Ripped received very positive reviews and was ranked at No. 12 in The Village Voice 's 2006 Pazz & Jop critics ' poll .

 Rather Ripped is the follow @-@ up to Sonic Youth 's 2004 album Sonic Nurse and the band 's first record after the departure of multi @-@ instrumentalist Jim O 'Rourke , who joined the group as a fifth member in 1999 . According to guitarist Lee Ranaldo , O 'Rourke left the band to pursue film work and other recording projects . His departure affected the sound of Rather Ripped , with singer and guitarist Thurston Moore stating that the new record " is just a far more straight up rock and roll album " , in contrast to the " darker , twisted , complex quality " of O 'Rourke 's contributions . Moore also explained that he decided to write simpler songs " for everybody to plug into immediately " . The album 's working titles were Sonic Life and Do You Believe in Rapture ? The name " Rather Ripped " came from a Berkeley , California record store that later moved to Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . 
 Unlike its immediate predecessors , which were recorded at the band 's own Echo Canyon studio in Lower Manhattan , Rather Ripped was recorded at Sear Sound in New York City ( the same studio where their 1994 album Experimental Jet Set , Trash and No Star was recorded ) , from December 2005 to January 2006 . The album was quickly produced and much of the material was not reworked due to the band 's limited time in the studio . During the recording sessions , Moore 's gear included two Fender Jazzmasters and a Fender Princeton . Ranaldo , on the other hand , played a Gibson Les Paul guitar for half of the album and used his Fender Telecaster Deluxe , " Jazzmaster copy @-@ made " by Saul Koll , and modified Fender Jazzmaster with <unk> for the remaining tracks . Guitars were directly plugged into the mixer with no guitar amplifier in the signal chain . The band chose John Agnello as the album 's engineer due to his work with Don Fleming on albums by Screaming Trees in the early 1990s . He was also recommended by fellow musician J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr . , who had been working with Agnello for years . Additional work was done in early 2006 at Echo Canyon , as well as J Mascis 's <unk> studio in Amherst , Massachusetts . The album was mastered by Greg Calbi at Sterling Sound in New York City in March 2006 .

 Rather Ripped is generally considered one of the band 's most accessible albums , featuring an abundance of concise and catchy melodies . Moore described it as " a super song record " that contains " rockers and ballads " . In addition , seven of the album 's 12 tracks have a duration of less than four minutes , a feature that is uncommon in previous Sonic Youth releases . The album generally favors guitar textures over feedback or noise , which typically characterized the band 's earlier works . Dave Heaton of PopMatters remarked that the guitars on Rather Ripped are joined together to form a vibrant and mysterious sound , stating that " it often feels like Sonic Youth are taking all the instrumental tricks they 've learned over the years and putting them in the service of building a lasting landscape of guitar sounds , one that reverberates with the sounds of the past but also feels eternally youthful " . 
 Lyrically , Rather Ripped deals with melancholic topics about adultery , sexual frustration and infidelity . In the opening track , " Reena " , whose working title was " <unk> " , singer and bassist Kim Gordon is involved in a secondary relationship with a woman . Lead single " Incinerate " is built on a conventional love @-@ as @-@ fire metaphor , while " What a Waste " attributes sexual lust . " Pink Steam " , which is the longest track of the album , features a lengthy instrumental part that was described as " gorgeously windswept and violently romantic " . Its title was taken from a book by San Francisco author Dodie Bellamy . The song " Do You Believe in Rapture ? " is a political reflection on Christians in the office , while " Rats " , which is the only song on the album written by Ranaldo , was described as a " fulfilling ghost @-@ narrative " . The album ends with the semi @-@ acoustic ballad " Or " , which starts with strip @-@ club imagery and ends with Moore recounting various interview @-@ like questions such as " What comes first ? The music or the words ? " 
 = = Release = = 
 Rather Ripped was released on June 13 , 2006 and completed Sonic Youth 's contract with major label Geffen Records , which also released the band 's previous eight albums . The UK edition of the album includes two outtakes , " Helen Lundeberg " and " <unk> " , which were previously released as a 7 " single on the band 's own label , Sonic Youth Records . To promote the album , the band embarked on a tour across the United States , starting at New York 's famed CBGB on June 13 , 2006 , where the band had not performed since 1992 , and ending at the Bank of America Pavilion in Boston on September 3 , 2006 . Bassist Mark Ibold , formerly of the indie rock band Pavement , joined the band as part of the touring group . 
 Upon release , Rather Ripped peaked at No. 71 on the US Billboard 200 chart and No. 64 on the UK Albums Chart . The album also charted in other countries , including Australia , Belgium , Finland , France and Norway . The song " Incinerate " was released as a single in France and Australia in 2006 . Additionally , five music videos , one for " Incinerate " and four for " Jams Run Free " , were directed by French director and writer Claire Denis . The video for " Incinerate " is a performance of the band that was recorded at Le Nouveau Casino in Paris prior to their 2006 tour in support of the album , while the others are set in an apartment and repeat images of cats , roofing tiles and TV antennas . The videos were shot with a consumer @-@ grade digital video camera and feature a dissolving image resolution and fluctuating color palette . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Rather Ripped received generally very positive reviews from critics . PopMatters editor Dave Heaton felt that the album was a graceful and elegant way to end Sonic Youth 's unique relationship with Geffen , describing it as a " cohesive story about a band seeking the best way to take the reckless , brave spirits of free jazz , punk , and experimental music , and generate them within the confines of traditional rock song structure " . He also praised Moore 's lyrics , stating that " his Beat @-@ style poetry is especially evocative , and especially terse — a quality that fits well with an album that musically seems to be doing much the same , communicating a lot with a little " . Similarly , Dave Simpson of The Guardian felt that the band reinvented themselves with poppier songs , calling Rather Ripped " an extraordinary state of affairs in Sonic Youth 's 25th year " . 
 Writing for Rolling Stone , Rob Sheffield highlighted Moore 's guitar playing for giving the album " a sense of emotional urgency " and considered " Incinerate " and " Pink Steam " some of the album 's highlights . Gordon 's vocal delivery was widely praised , with Ben Ratliff of The New York Times comparing it favorably to The Velvet Underground singer and collaborator Nico . Prominent music critic Robert Christgau also remarked that Gordon sounds " breathlessly girlish " despite being 53 at the time , and that both she and Moore " evoke visions of dalliance , displacement , recrimination , and salvation that never become unequivocally literal " . Sheffield concluded that the album features her first worthwhile songs in a decade . 
 Steve Hochman of Los Angeles Times credited the album 's catchy melodies for being smartly and effectively handled , commenting that " it almost makes you wonder what would have happened if Television and Peter Frampton had worked together " . Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly wrote that , although the band " can still knock out a noisy punk stomper when the mood strikes " like on the track " <unk> Around " , the cleaner and quieter melodies are the ones that " really rip up your emotions " . Slant 's Jimmy Newlin stated similar pros , noting that " quiet is the new loud " , and felt that the band 's shift towards romantic poignancy was " a welcome growth as the band advances well into its second decade of existence " . 
 Other reviews were less enthusiastic . Spin editor Joe Gross criticized Rather Ripped for its lack of expansive songs , stating that the album " is about three- or four @-@ minute songcraft — never the highlight of their résumé , even when [ Gordon ] lends her singular rasp " . Brandon <unk> of Pitchfork Media felt that the second half of the album was weaker than the first and criticized the lyrics of the closer " Or " . AllMusic reviewer Heather Phares remarked that the band 's playing can occasionally outpace their songwriting , but nevertheless <unk> Rather Ripped as " a solidly good album " that " shows that Sonic Youth is still in a comfortable yet creative groove , not a rut " . In February 2007 , Rather Ripped was ranked at No. 12 in The Village Voice 's 2006 Pazz & Jop critics ' poll . Additionally , Rolling Stone editors ranked the album third on their Top 50 Albums of 2006 list , while Pitchfork ranked it 43rd on a similar list .

 = Italian cruiser Coatit = 
 Coatit was a torpedo cruiser of the Italian Regia Marina built in the late 1890s . She was the second and final member of the Agordat class . The ship , which was armed with twelve 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns and two 450 mm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , was too slow and short @-@ ranged to be able to scout effectively for the fleet , so her career was limited . She saw action during the Italo @-@ Turkish War in 1911 – 12 , where she provided gunfire support to Italian troops in North Africa . She also caused a minor diplomatic incident from an attack on retreating Ottoman soldiers in Anatolia . Coatit was part of an international fleet sent to Constantinople when the city appeared to be at risk of falling to the Bulgarian Army during the First Balkan War . In 1919 , she was converted into a minelayer and was sold for scrap in 1920 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Coatit was 91 @.@ 6 meters ( 301 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 9 @.@ 32 m ( 30 @.@ 6 ft ) and a draft of 3 @.@ 54 m ( 11 @.@ 6 ft ) . She displaced up to 1 @,@ 292 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 272 long tons ; 1 @,@ 424 short tons ) at full load . Her propulsion system consisted of a pair of horizontal triple @-@ expansion steam engines each driving a single screw propeller , with steam supplied by eight Blechynden water @-@ tube boilers . Her engines were rated at 8 @,@ 215 indicated horsepower ( 6 @,@ 126 kW ) and produced a top speed of 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . The ship had a cruising radius of about 300 nautical miles ( 560 km ; 350 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a crew of between 153 – 185 . 
 Coatit was armed with a main battery of twelve 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) L / 40 guns mounted singly . She was also equipped with two 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . The ship was only lightly armored , with a 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) thick deck . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The keel for Coatit was laid down at the Castellammare shipyard on 8 April 1897 and her completed hull was launched on 15 November 1899 . After completing fitting @-@ out work , the new cruiser was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 1 October 1900 . She proved to be too slow and short @-@ legged to be useful as a fleet scout , which limited her active duty career . She served in the main fleet in 1903 – 1904 , during which time the fleet was kept in a state of readiness for seven months . For the remaining five months , the ships had reduced crews . In 1904 , the ship was transferred to the Red Sea and stationed in Italy 's colony in Eritrea along with three other small vessels . Coatit was assigned to the hostile force that was tasked with simulating an attempt to land troops on Sicily during the 1908 fleet maneuvers . 
 At the outbreak of the Italo @-@ Turkish War against the Ottoman Empire in September 1911 , Coatit was stationed in the 4th Division of the 2nd Squadron , under Rear Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel , the commander of the division . Coatit protected several battleships and armored cruisers while they bombarded the defenses of Tripoli on 3 – 4 October . Coatit , the armored cruiser Varese , and sixteen destroyers were tasked with patrolling the flanks of the bombardment force to prevent a surprise attack by the Ottoman Navy , which did not materialize . On 15 October , Coatit and her sister joined the battleship Napoli , the armored cruisers Pisa , Amalfi , and San Marco , three destroyers , and several troop transports for an attack on the port of Derna . Negotiators were sent ashore to attempt to secure the surrender of the garrison , which was refused . Napoli and the armored cruisers bombarded the Ottoman positions throughout the day , and on 18 October the Ottomans withdrew , allowing the Italian troops to come ashore and take possession of the port . The fleet remained offshore and helped to repel Ottoman counterattacks over the following two weeks . On 3 October 1912 , Coatit bombarded the port of <unk> . She thereafter shelled an Ottoman infantry battalion in the area , which fled ; she nevertheless continued to fire on the retreating troops , expending around 200 rounds during the attack . The French cruiser Bruix was nearby and witnessed the attack , which her commander protested as a breach of international law . 
 Coatit was among an international force that entered the Ottoman capital city , Constantinople , during the First Balkan War in November 1912 , less than a month after the end of the Italo @-@ Turkish War . She and the battleship Emanuele Filiberto entered the straits on 11 November , along with the French armored cruisers Victor Hugo and Léon Gambetta , where they joined a pair of British cruisers . Warships from Germany , including the battlecruiser Goeben , Russia — the battleship Rostislav — and Spain arrived thereafter . The ships put a force of about 3 @,@ 000 men ashore to protect their nationals , though by the end of the month , the Bulgarian advance on the city had been halted . The international fleet nevertheless remained in the Sea of Marmara for a time until it was withdrawn to the island of Crete and subsequently dispersed . Coatit was converted into a minelayer in 1919 . Eight of the 76 mm guns and her torpedo tubes were removed and a pair of 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) L / 40 guns were installed . She served only briefly in this role and she was sold to ship breakers on 11 June 1920 .

Three days later on SmackDown , Fox assisted Brie Bella in her match against Paige , and thus aligning herself with The Bella Twins and formed " Team Bella " . After weeks of Team Bella outnumbering Paige , Naomi , and Tamina , Stephanie McMahon called for a " revolution " in the WWE Divas Division by introducing the debuting Charlotte and Becky Lynch as Paige 's allies , and NXT Women 's Champion Sasha Banks aligning with Naomi and Tamina , leading to a brawl between the three teams .

Post @-@ match , she along her allies were attacked by Emma , Summer , Lana , Tamina and Naomi , before they were saved by a returning Eva Marie .

 = USS Conyngham ( DD @-@ 58 ) = 
 USS Conyngham ( Destroyer No. 58 / DD @-@ 58 ) was a Tucker @-@ class destroyer built for the United States Navy prior to the American entry into World War I. The ship was the first U.S. Navy vessel named for Gustavus Conyngham . 
 Conyngham was laid down by the William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia , in July 1914 and launched in July of the following year . The ship was a little more than 315 feet ( 96 m ) in length , just over 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) abeam , and had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 090 long tons ( 1 @,@ 110 t ) . She was armed with four 4 @-@ inch ( 10 cm ) guns and had eight 21 @-@ inch ( 530 mm ) torpedo tubes . Conyngham was powered by a pair of steam turbines that propelled her at up to 29 @.@ 5 knots ( 54 @.@ 6 km / h ) . 
 After her January 1916 commissioning , Conyngham sailed in the Atlantic and the Caribbean . After the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , Conyngham was part of the first U.S. destroyer squadron sent overseas . Patrolling the Irish Sea out of Queenstown , Ireland , Conyngham made several rescues of passengers and crew from ships sunk by U @-@ boats . Conyngham 's commander was commended for actions related to what was thought at the time to be a " probable " kill of a German submarine . 
 Upon returning to the United State in December 1918 , Conyngham underwent repairs at the Boston Navy Yard . She remained there in reduced commission through 1921 , with only brief episodes of activity . After returning to active service for about a year , she was decommissioned in June 1922 . In June 1924 , Conyngham was transferred to the United States Coast Guard to help enforce Prohibition as a part of the " Rum Patrol " . She operated under the name USCGC Conyngham ( CG @-@ 2 ) until 1933 , when she was returned to the Navy . Later that year , the ship was renamed DD @-@ 58 to free the name Conyngham for another destroyer . She was sold for scrap in August 1934 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Conyngham was authorized in 1913 as the second ship of the Tucker class which , like the related O 'Brien class , was an improved version of the Cassin @-@ class destroyers authorized in 1911 . Construction of the vessel was awarded to William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia , which laid down her keel on 27 July 1914 . Twelve months later , on 8 July 1915 , Conyngham was launched by sponsor Miss A. C. Stevens , a great @-@ great @-@ granddaughter of the ship 's namesake , Gustavus Conyngham ( 1744 – 1819 ) , a Continental Navy officer . As built , Conyngham was 315 feet 3 inches ( 96 @.@ 09 m ) in length and 30 feet 6 inches ( 9 @.@ 30 m ) abeam and drew 9 feet 4 inches ( 2 @.@ 84 m ) . The ship had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 090 long tons ( 1 @,@ 110 t ) and displaced 1 @,@ 205 long tons ( 1 @,@ 224 t ) when fully loaded . 
 Conyngham had two Curtis steam turbines that drove her two screw propellers , and an additional steam turbine geared to one of the propeller shafts for cruising purposes . The power plant could generate 18 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 13 @,@ 000 kW ) and move the ship at speeds up to 29 @.@ 5 knots ( 54 @.@ 6 km / h ) . 
 Conyngham 's main battery consisted of four 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) / 50 Mark 9 guns , with each gun weighing in excess of 6 @,@ 100 pounds ( 2 @,@ 800 kg ) . The guns fired 33 @-@ pound ( 15 kg ) armor @-@ piercing projectiles at 2 @,@ 900 feet per second ( 880 m / s ) . At an elevation of 20 ° , the guns had a range of 15 @,@ 920 yards ( 14 @,@ 560 m ) . 
 Conyngham was also equipped with eight 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes . The General Board of the United States Navy had called for two anti @-@ aircraft guns for the Tucker @-@ class ships , as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines . From sources , it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for Conyngham or any of the other ships of the class . 
 = = Early career = = 
 USS Conyngham was commissioned into the United States Navy on 21 January 1916 under the command of Lieutenant Commander A. W. Johnson . Following her commissioning , Conyngham joined in tactics and war maneuvers off the east coast in 1916 and in the beginning of 1917 sailed to the Caribbean for war games and fleet maneuvers . Returning to Norfolk , Virginia on 23 March , she joined 5th Naval District Patrol Force and with Wadsworth and Sampson patrolled the approaches to Chesapeake Bay . 
 = = World War I = = 
 On 24 April 1917 Conyngham sailed from Boston , Massachusetts with her division for Queenstown , Ireland , the first destroyers to join English forces for duty after the entry of the United States into World War I earlier that month . This force patrolled off the Irish coast and escorted convoys through the danger zone where German submarine operated . 
 The destroyers also providing rescue services for stricken ships . When the British ship Karina was torpedoed and sunk by German submarine UC @-@ 75 on 17 August 1917 , Conyngham sped to her assistance and rescued 39 survivors . A similar distress call from the British ship Hartland on 22 November — torpedoed by German submarine U @-@ 97 — resulted in the rescue of her 30 @-@ man crew by Conyngham . 
 The British Armed merchant cruiser Orama and ten destroyers , including Conyngham , were escorting an eastbound convoy of twenty steamers on 19 October , when German submarine U @-@ 62 surfaced in the midst of the group . The submarine launched its only remaining torpedo at Orama , sinking that vessel . Lookouts on Conyngham saw U @-@ 62 's periscope and quickly launched a depth charge attack on the spot where the U @-@ boat had submerged , bringing oil and debris to the surface . Conyngham 's commanding officer was commended for his prompt and effective action , and the British Admiralty awarded Conyngham a " probable " kill on the submarine . Unfortunately for Conyngham 's record , though , U @-@ 62 had survived the encounter .

 After the hostilities had ended on 11 November 1918 with Germany signing the Armistice , Conyngham sailed from Queenstown on 14 December 1918 for Boston to have an overhaul . From February to April 1919 , the destroyer participated in fleet exercises and division maneuvers in the Caribbean . Returning to Boston , she was placed in reduced commission until 1921 . 
 In June 1921 , Conyngham accompanied a Cuban warship that was repatriating the remains of former Cuban President Jose Miguel Gómez to Havana . She returned to Newport , Rhode Island , for summer exercises with her squadron and , after wintering at Charleston , South Carolina , reported to Philadelphia Navy Yard in March 1922 for inactivation . She was decommissioned there on 23 June 1922 .

 On 17 January 1920 , Prohibition was instituted by law in the United States . Soon , the smuggling of alcoholic beverages along the coastlines of the United States became widespread and blatant . The Treasury Department eventually determined that the United States Coast Guard simply did not have the ships to constitute a successful patrol . To cope with the problem , President Calvin Coolidge in 1924 authorized the transfer from the Navy to the Coast Guard of twenty old destroyers that were in reserve and out of commission . Conyngham was reactivated and transferred to the Treasury Department on 7 June 1924 for use by the Coast Guard . Designated CG @-@ 2 , Conyngham was commissioned on 8 March 1925 , and joined the " Rum Patrol " to aid in the attempt to enforce prohibition laws . 
 After the United States Congress proposed the Twenty @-@ first Amendment to end prohibition in February 1933 , plans were made for Conyngham to be returned to the Navy . On 27 May 1933 , Conyngham arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard , and was decommissioned nine days later , on 5 June . Conyngham was transferred back to the Navy on 30 June . Later in 1933 , the ship was renamed DD @-@ 58 in order to free the name Conyngham for a new destroyer of the same name . DD @-@ 58 remained in noncommissioned status until struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 July 1934 . She was sold for scrap on 22 August in accordance with the London Naval Treaty .

 = = Plot = = 
 Michael ( Steve Carell ) is depressed because it is the first Valentine 's Day since he and Holly broke up . Michael donates blood at a mobile blood drive being held in the business park 's parking lot and has a nice conversation with a female donor ( Kathryn <unk> ) sitting next to him . When they both finish at the same time , Michael passes out because he did not eat much before giving blood , and when he wakes up she is gone . A disappointed Michael finds a glove he assumes she left behind and takes it , hoping she will come back for it . When Michael goes back into the office , he decides to gather all the single employees into the conference room to discuss their own personal romantic dilemmas . After becoming further depressed by their sad dating stories , Michael decides to try lifting their spirits by holding a singles mixer . He puts up flyers which also advertise the finding of a missing glove , and Michael hopes his mystery woman will come to the party as a result . 
 When Jim ( John Krasinski ) and Pam ( Jenna Fischer ) are threatened with banishment by Michael after they constantly gaze happily on each other , Phyllis ( Phyllis Smith ) invites them to have lunch with her and her husband Bob Vance ( Robert R. Shafer ) . Their meal initially goes well , but Phyllis and Bob disappear for a while after their food arrives . Hungry and not wanting to be rude by eating before they get back , Jim and Pam check the bathrooms and hear Phyllis and Bob having sex in the disabled bathroom . Phyllis and Bob finally come back to their table and Jim and Pam lose their appetites and look on in disgust as Phyllis and Bob seductively put food in each other 's mouths .

 " Blood Drive " was written by Brent Forrester and directed by Randall Einhorn . It featured the first appearance of actress Lisa K. Wyatt as Lynne , who would continue to make frequent appearances as a romantic interest for Kevin . During the episode , the Ed Helms character Andy is described as attending solo honeymoons in Napa Valley , The Bahamas and Walt Disney World Resort , which he previously booked before breaking off his engagement with Angela . Following the episode , NBC posted fake photos of Ed Helms visiting those locations on the show 's official Angela Martin and Andrew Bernard wedding website . The photos included Helms scuba @-@ diving , standing in front of a hot air balloon and visiting Disney 's Epcot Center , and includes an assurance by Andy that he " wanted all my bros and bras in cyberspace to know that the Ol ' Nard Dog is doing just fine . ” 
 The official website for The Office included three cut scenes from " Blood Drive " within a week of its original release . In the first 85 @-@ second clip , Dwight assures his office @-@ mates that the blood taken in the <unk> will not be used in any " ritualistic ways " . Later , while giving blood himself , he asks the hospital employee , " How do I know it 's not going to go into a person who will later come back to kill me ? " The second clip was two minutes of extended footage from the singles party . Meredith talks about her husband leaving her for a garbage @-@ woman whom her kids now consider their real mother instead of herself , and Dwight said he believes his soulmate , " probably died 700 years ago in feudal Japan after having impersonated a samurai , or at the very least she lives somewhere outside the Scranton Wilkes @-@ Barre corridor . " In the final 90 @-@ second clip , Dwight shows off his bobblehead doll collection to a woman , Creed tries unsuccessfully to pick up Lynne , and Dwight gets rid of an attractive male visitor who Michael fears could be competition . Dwight tells him the party is cancelled " due to a death in the elevator " .

 During the singles party , Angela mentions that two men previously had a duel over her in Ohio , which is the second duel fought over her . This is a reference to " The Duel " , an Office episode from earlier in the fifth season , in which Andy and Dwight duel for her affections in the Dunder Mifflin parking lot . In the beginning of the " Blood Drive " episode , Jim , Michael and Dwight drive a phone salesman away by repeatedly saying " <unk> ! " in the style of Fonzie , the popular character from the sitcom Happy Days . The mysterious woman leaves a single pink glove behind after meeting Michael , in a similar fashion to the classic folk tale Cinderella . Kelly refers to the encounter as " like a modern @-@ day Enchanted " . Michael says he was hit by " Cupid 's sparrow " , a mistaken reference to the Roman mythological god who would inspire love by shooting people with arrows . 
 Michael makes jokes about feeling like a human juice box , describing himself as " Type O @-@ <unk> Spray " , a combination of type O blood and the Ocean Spray juice company , and as " Hawaiian Blood Punch " , a reference to the fruit punch drink Hawaiian Punch . Jim says , " I have a lot of work to do this afternoon . Those mines aren 't going to sweep themselves , " a reference to the computer game Minesweeper . Ryan is said to be " sleeping with random prostitutes " in Thailand ; prostitution in the Southeast Asian nation is technically illegal , but is in practice tolerated and regulated . Kevin said his previous engagement ended immediately after he remarked that the Philadelphia Eagles , a National Football League football team , might have a chance at winning the NFC East division championship .

 In its original American broadcast on March 5 , 2009 , " Blood Drive " was watched by 8 @.@ 63 million overall viewers , which was about average for the series at the time . The episode received a 5 @.@ 1 rating / 14 share among viewers aged between 18 and 34 , and a 4 @.@ 5 rating / 11 share among viewers between 18 and 49 . The episode of 30 Rock , which aired at 9 : 30 p.m. directly after The Office , was seen by 7 @.@ 35 million viewers , an increase of 30 percent in viewership from the previous week 's 6 @.@ 3 million . Commentators said " Blood Drive " was directly responsible for this ratings increase for 30 Rock because the lead @-@ in Office episode was new , whereas the previous week 's episode was a repeat . 
 The episode received generally mixed reviews . Brian Howard of The Journal News described it as " classic Office " and praised the camaraderie the staff showed for each other and the " bizarre discomfort " of the double date with Jim , Pam , Phyllis and Bob . Howard described Dwight and Kevin as the episode 's stand @-@ outs . Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger said the episode lacked many laugh @-@ out @-@ loud moments , but was effective because the characters are so well developed : " The Office has , over the years , become as much of a kitchen sink drama as it is a comedy . ... The characters are so well @-@ drawn by now , and for the most part so likable , that a sweet , low @-@ key episode about Michael and the staff bonding over their <unk> worked even without a lot of memorable jokes . " Travis Fickett of IGN described the episode as " familiar territory , but it has plenty of fun moments . " Fickett praised the scene with Carell and the mystery woman , and Jim and Pam 's lunch . But Fickett said the series needed to address why Pam was staying with the company : " Jim and Pam still work there because , well , that 's part of the show - but there really isn 't a very good reason as to why these two would still be at this dead end job . " 
 Will Leitch of New York magazine described " Blood Drive " as " mostly a placeholder episode " , although he said it was " legitimately touching " when the cast stays late with Michael during the party . Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club , who gave the episode a B + grade , said the episode included both pathos and " big laughs " . He particularly liked the joke of Andy attending all his honeymoons : " The thought of Andy forlornly embarking on a couple ’ s massage solo or sharing a romantic hot air balloon ride with himself was funny and sad in the best Office tradition . " Entertainment Weekly writer Jeff Labrecque said the episode was " unusually sweet " , but said the double date with Pam , Jim , Phyllis and Bob " felt slightly undercooked " . Josh McAuliffe of The Times @-@ Tribune of Scranton , Pennsylvania , said the episode was " a highly amusing , if not fantastic , half @-@ hour " and particularly praised the opening scene involving the phone system salesman . 
 Several reviewers described Dwight 's quote , " I can retract my penis up into itself , " as the most memorable line of the episode . Phyllis and Bob Vance 's sexual rendezvous in the handicapped restroom during the double date ranked number 8 in phillyBurbs.com 's top ten moments from the fifth season of The Office . " Blood Drive " was voted the seventeenth highest @-@ rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season , according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally ; the episode was rated 7 @.@ 86 out of 10 . 
 = Robert and Thomas Wintour = 
 Robert Wintour ( 1568 – 30 January 1606 ) and Thomas Wintour ( 1571 or 1572 – 31 January 1606 ) , also spelt Winter , were members of the Gunpowder Plot , a failed conspiracy to assassinate King James I. Both were related to other conspirators , such as their cousin , Robert Catesby , and a half @-@ brother , John Wintour , also joined them following the plot 's failure . Thomas was an intelligent and educated man , fluent in several languages and trained as a lawyer , but chose instead to become a soldier , fighting for England in the Low Countries , France , and possibly in Central Europe . By 1600 , however , he changed his mind and became a fervent Catholic . On several occasions he travelled to the continent and entreated Spain on behalf of England 's oppressed Catholics , and suggested that with Spanish support a Catholic rebellion was likely . 
 As a momentum was building behind a peace settlement between the two countries , Thomas 's pleas fell on deaf ears . Instead , in 1604 he decided to join with Catesby , who planned to restore England to Catholicism by killing the king , and inciting a popular revolt in the Midlands , during which James 's daughter , Princess Elizabeth , would be installed as titular queen . Thomas returned to the continent and again failed to elicit Spanish support , but instead met Guy Fawkes , with whom he returned to England . Robert , a devout Catholic who inherited Huddington Court near Worcester , joined the conspiracy the following year . 
 The plot began to unravel following the delivery of an anonymous letter to William Parker , 4th Baron Monteagle , warning him to stay away from Parliament . Thomas and Catesby confronted Monteagle 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , the recently recruited Francis Tresham , threatening to kill him , but Tresham managed to convince them of his innocence . At that stage Thomas reportedly asked Catesby to abandon the scheme , to no avail . When Fawkes was captured at about midnight on 4 November 1605 , Thomas fled to Robert 's house at Huddington . Catesby and most of the others spent two days travelling across the Midlands attempting to incite a rebellion , but with an ever @-@ diminishing group of supporters they eventually settled at Holbeche House in Staffordshire , and waited for government forces to arrive . Thomas , by then reintegrated into the group , chose to remain with them , and in the ensuing firefight was shot in the shoulder , and captured . Robert , who had left before the battle , evaded capture until January 1606 . 
 Much of what is written about the plot is based on Thomas 's confessions , given in the Tower of London in November 1605 . The brothers were tried on 27 January 1606 , and hanged , drawn and quartered several days later in London . 
 = = Family and life before 1604 = = 
 Robert ( b . 1568 ) and Thomas Wintour ( b . 1571 – 72 ) were sons of George Wintour of Huddington Court in Worcestershire , and his wife Jane ( née Ingleby ) , daughter of Sir William Ingleby of Ripley Castle near Knaresborough . A sister , Dorothy , married another conspirator , John Grant . Two <unk> half @-@ siblings , John and Elizabeth , resulted from their father 's marriage to Elizabeth Bourn , following Jane 's death . Their paternal grandparents were Robert Wintour of <unk> in Gloucestershire , and his wife Catherine , daughter of Sir George Throckmorton of Coughton in Warwickshire . As scions of the Throckmortons , they could therefore claim a kinship with plotters like Robert Catesby and Francis Tresham . Their maternal uncle Francis Ingleby , a Catholic priest , was hanged , drawn and quartered at York in 1586 , a fact which in the opinion of historian and author Antonia Fraser , " could hardly have failed to leave a stark impression upon the Wintour family . " The <unk> took their name from the Welsh Gwyn Tour ( White Tower ) . ' <unk> ' was sometimes used in signatures , but not ' Winter ' ( as the brothers are commonly named ) . 
 A faithful Catholic , Robert was married to Gertrude Talbot , daughter of the recusant John Talbot of Grafton . He inherited the Tudor Huddington Court near Worcester , along with a significant fortune with which he was known to be generous . Under Robert , Huddington Court became a known refuge for priests . The proclamation for his capture , issued following the plot 's failure , described him as " a man of mean stature , and rather low than otherwise ; square made , somewhat stooping ; near 40 years of age ; his hair and beard brown ; his beard not much , and his hair short . " The Jesuit John Gerard wrote that he was " esteemed in his life to be one of the wisest and most resolute and sufficient gentlemen in Worcestershire " . Gerard 's appraisal of Thomas was just as complimentary . He was apparently an intelligent , witty and educated man , who could speak Latin , Italian , Spanish and French . " He was of mean stature , but strong and comely and very <unk> , about 33 years old or somewhat more . " Thomas worked as a servant to William Parker , 4th Baron Monteagle . He was educated as a lawyer , but following several years of dissipation travelled to Flanders and enrolled in the English army . He fought against Catholic Spain in the Low Countries , France and possibly against the Turks in Central Europe . However , by 1600 his views had changed ; citing his belief in the injustice of fighting against the power of Catholic Spain , like his elder brother he became a passionate Catholic . Travelling as ' Mr Winter of Worcestershire ' , from 24 February 1601 he spent 13 days in Rome for the jubilee , and later that year and into 1602 travelled to Spain , to petition the Council on behalf of the Catholic rebels left leaderless by the execution of Robert Devereux , 2nd Earl of Essex . Father Henry Garnet , perhaps thinking that the purpose behind Thomas 's visit was to gain financial support for impoverished English Catholics , sent him to Superior Father Joseph Creswell , who made the introductions to the Spanish . This trip to Spain later became the first of two visits to be dubbed by the English government as the Spanish Treason , but Thomas 's timing was unfortunate , coming as it did so soon after Spain 's failed attack in Ireland , and he received only vague assurances of their support . In England he met with the Spanish embassy Don Juan de Tassis , who in August 1603 landed at Dover to help negotiate an Anglo @-@ Spanish treaty . Tassis quickly realised that any chance of a successful Catholic rebellion was unlikely , and discounted Thomas 's claim that , with funding , " 3 @,@ 000 Catholics " would be available for the cause . After meeting with King James he wrote to Spain emphasising the need to prioritise peace with England over the freedom of her Catholics . 
 = = Thomas meets with Robert Catesby and John Wright = = 
 According to contemporary accounts late in February 1604 Thomas 's cousin , Robert Catesby , invited him to his house in Lambeth , but Thomas was indisposed and could not attend . Catesby sent a second letter that Thomas did respond to , and when he arrived he found his cousin with John Wright , a devout Catholic and a renowned swordsman . Catesby planned to re @-@ establish Catholicism in England by blowing up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament , killing the king . Thomas did not immediately recoil from the idea . As a former soldier he was a practical man , and he agreed with Catesby that should the plot succeed , it would " breed a confusion fit to beget new alterations " . He also offered a warning of the price of failure : " the scandal would be so great which the Catholic religion might hereby sustain , as not only our enemies , but our friends also would with good reason condemn us . " He nevertheless agreed to join the conspiracy , and as Catesby had not entirely given up hope of foreign support — " because we will leave no peaceable and quiet way untried " — Thomas returned to the continent . 
 In Flanders he met Juan Fernández de Velasco , 5th Duke of Frías and Constable of Castile , who was holding court there before his journey to England to conclude the Treaty of London . Thomas again stressed the plight of English Catholics , hoping to influence the forthcoming treaty negotiations due to take place at Somerset House in London . The Constable was " friendly rather than forthcoming " . Thomas also met the Welsh spy Hugh Owen , and Sir William Stanley , who were both disparaging of Catesby 's hopes of Spanish assistance . Owen did , however , introduce Thomas to Guy Fawkes , a committed Catholic who had served under Stanley as a soldier in the Southern Netherlands . Although at that time the plotters had no detailed plans , Thomas told Fawkes of their ambition to " do somewhat in England " , should Spanish support be lacking . In late April therefore the two men returned together to Catesby 's lodgings at Lambeth , and told him that despite positive noises from the Spanish , " the deeds would nott answere " . 
 = = Robert joins = = 
 With the addition to the conspiracy of Thomas Percy ( John Wright 's brother @-@ in @-@ law ) , the five plotters met at the Duck and Drake inn , in the fashionable Strand district of London , on 20 May 1604 . From hereon Thomas Wintour remained at the heart of the conspiracy . The group leased properties in London , one in Lambeth for storing the gunpowder that was rowed across the Thames to its destination . His confession has the plotters digging a tunnel toward their target during one of the several <unk> of Parliament , abandoned when the chamber directly beneath the House of Lords became available . 
 Following the meeting in May Catesby enlisted the aid of several more Catholic men , including Robert Wintour . On the same day he was admitted to the plot , 25 March 1605 , the conspirators also purchased the lease to the undercroft they had supposedly tunnelled near . It was into this room that 36 barrels of gunpowder were brought , but when in late August Thomas and Fawkes made an inspection of the gunpowder , they found that it had decayed ( separated ) . Thus , more gunpowder was brought in . 
 Shortly after this , Catesby recruited the last three conspirators , Sir Ambrose Rookwood , Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham . The latter 's involvement in the plot has long been the subject of controversy , as on 26 October his brother @-@ in @-@ law William Parker , 4th Baron Monteagle , received an anonymous letter while at home , warning him to stay away from Parliament . Thomas went with Catesby to confront Tresham on the matter , threatening to " hang him " if he did not exonerate himself . Tresham managed to convince the pair that he was innocent , but Thomas then tried unsuccessfully to persuade Catesby to abandon the plot . His pleas were in vain ; Catesby 's position was echoed by Percy , who at a meeting of the three in London on Sunday 3 November , said that he was ready to " abide the uttermost trial " . On the same day , Robert and three others stayed at the home of John Talbot of Grafton , his father @-@ in @-@ law . His friends were Robert Acton and his two sons , plus servants . The group left the following morning with extra horses supplied by Everard Digby , and travelled to Coventry . 
 = = Failure and capture = = 
 Monteagle had delivered the letter to the English Secretary of State , Robert Cecil , 1st Earl of Salisbury , and on Saturday 2 November ( about a week later ) the Privy Council decided to undertake a search of Parliament . The following Monday , during the first search , Thomas Howard , 1st Earl of Suffolk , noticed the huge pile of faggots in the corner of the cellar beneath the House of Lords . The king insisted that another search be made , and about midnight another party , this time led by Thomas Knyvet , 1st Baron Knyvet , discovered Fawkes and arrested him . 
 News of Fawkes 's capture soon spread throughout London , including the Strand , where Christopher Wright , John Wright 's brother , overheard the commotion . He immediately went to Thomas , who was staying at the Duck and Drake inn . As Fawkes had given his name as " John Johnson " , servant of Percy , it was for the latter that the government 's first arrest warrant was issued . Thomas guessed as much , and told Wright to go to Percy and " bid him <unk> " . As the rest of those conspirators still in London fled the city , undaunted , he went over to Westminster to try and discern what he could . In author Alan Haynes 's opinion , this demonstrated an impressive degree of trust in Fawkes 's ability to confound his interrogators , but when Thomas heard for himself that the treason had been uncovered , he left for Huddington , stopping at his sister 's house in Norbrook along the way . 
 The fugitives reached Catesby 's family home of Ashby St Ledgers at about 6 : 00 pm . Not wanting to implicate his mother , Catesby sent a message to Robert , who had just recently arrived there , asking to meet just outside the town . There he told him that Fawkes had been captured . At Dunchurch they collected Everard Digby and his ' hunting party ' , which included Robert and Thomas 's half @-@ brother , John Wintour . He had been invited to join them on 4 November . The next day the group raided Warwick Castle for supplies , something that Robert strongly objected to as it would create " a great uproar " in the country , and later arrived at Huddington Court , where they met Thomas . Early the next morning Huddington 's occupants went to confession and took the Sacrament at Mass — in Fraser 's opinion , a sign that none of them thought they had long to live . They collected further arms and munitions from Hewell Grange , but trying to recruit more people to their cause they were met with disdain ; while the conspirators considered themselves to stand for " God and country " , the men of Hewell Grange replied that they were for " King James as well as God and Country " . Late that night , pulling a sodden cart full of weapons and armour behind them , they arrived at Holbeche House , near <unk> in Staffordshire . Robert was asked if he would go and see if he could elicit any help from his father @-@ in @-@ law , John Talbot . He refused , and Thomas went instead , with Stephen Littleton . Talbot was , however , loyal to James , and sent them away , claiming that their visit was " as much as his life was worth " . While returning to Holbeche , they received a message that Catesby , Rookwood , John Grant and another man were dead , and the rest apparently fled . Tired and desperate , the plotters had attempted to dry their soaked gunpowder in front of the fire , only for a stray spark to ignite it . While Littleton chose to leave , begging his companion to follow his example , Thomas continued on to Holbeche , where he found the remaining plotters alive , but injured . 
 While several including Robert and his half @-@ brother John chose to vanish into the night , Catesby , Percy , the Wright brothers , Grant , Rookwood and Thomas remained . Thomas asked them what they intended to do – " We mean here to die " . Thomas replied " I will take such part as you do " . Richard Walsh , Sheriff of Worcester , arrived with a vigilante force of about 200 men early on 8 November . Thomas was the first to be hit , in the shoulder , while crossing the courtyard . The Wright brothers were next , followed by Rookwood , still injured from the explosion the night before . Catesby and Percy were dropped by a single lucky shot . The sheriff 's men then proceeded to strip the defenders of their valuables , but Thomas was saved by the sheriff 's assistant . His fine sword , ordered and paid for four months previously , apparently proved too great a temptation for the Sheriff 's men , as it was never seen again . He and the others were taken first to Worcester , and then to the Tower of London . Despite a proclamation of 18 November naming them as wanted men , Robert Wintour and Stephen <unk> managed to evade capture until 9 January 1606 . They spent about two months hiding out in barns and houses ; at one point they were forced to restrain a drunken poacher who happened upon their hiding place . They were eventually discovered at the house of Humphrey Littleton in Hagley , after a cook , John <unk> , informed on them . Humphrey managed to escape , but was captured at Prestwood , in Staffordshire . 
 = = Thomas 's confession = = 
 Historically , much of what is written about the Gunpowder Plot is derived from Thomas 's confession , signed on 23 November 1605 ; details of the so @-@ called Spanish Treason were added three days later . One of only two confessions printed in the King 's Book ( a highly partial contemporary account of the affair ) , Thomas Wintour 's was the only account the government had of a plotter who had been involved from the beginning ; Guy Fawkes , weakened by days of torture , may have been at the heart of the group , but he was not at its first meetings . However , Antonia Fraser views the document with suspicion , not least because Thomas 's signature , ' Thomas Winter ' , differs from his normal signature , ' Thomas Wintour ' ( it was the former that was invariably used by the government ) . The signature , possibly forged by lieutenant of the Tower of London William Waad , was made only weeks after Thomas had been shot in the shoulder during the siege at Holbeche House . Biographer Mark Nicholls views the difference in signatures as a significant and puzzling lapse , if a " master forger " is presumed to be responsible for the document . He views the handwriting on the confession as " convincingly that of Winter [ Wintour ] " , pointing out that it appears to be the work of an author , not an editor , and written as a draft for the King 's Book . This is a view that generally , Alan Haynes agrees with : " no one has ever made a solid and sensible suggestion about why a government @-@ employed forger ( say Thomas <unk> ) would deliberately make such an error in a crucial state document " . 
 Another of Fraser 's concerns is Waad 's report to Salisbury on 21 November : " Thomas Winter doth find his hand so strong as after dinner he will settle himself to write that he hath verbally declared to your Lordship adding what he shall remember " — or rather , what he was told to remember . A draft of Thomas 's confession , in Coke 's handwriting , places extra weight on the involvement of the Jesuits . Thomas 's confession also details his account of the mine supposedly dug toward Parliament , not mentioned in Fawkes 's first confession . 
 = = Trial and death = = 
 The trial of the eight surviving conspirators began on Monday 27 January . The two brothers were brought with the other plotters by barge from the Tower ( <unk> 's servant , Thomas Bates , arrived from the Gatehouse Prison ) , to Whitehall . They were kept in Star Chamber , before being led into Westminster Hall . Charged with high treason , and with no defence counsel , the outcome was never in doubt . The Spanish Treason was a feature of Attorney General Edward Coke 's rhetoric , although the Spanish king was " reverently and respectfully spoken of " . The Jesuits , such as Henry Garnet , were condemned . Each of the brothers ' confessions were also read aloud . While in the Tower , Robert and Fawkes had shared adjacent cells , and were able to speak to each other . However , their private conversation was secretly recorded , and read aloud during the trial . 
 When asked if he had anything to say , " wherefore judgement of death should not be pronounced " , Thomas spoke of his regret at having introduced Robert to the plot , and asked to be hanged on his behalf as well as his own . Robert merely begged for mercy . At the end of the trial , the jury pronounced them all guilty of high treason . 
 Everard Digby , Robert Wintour , John Grant and Thomas Bates were executed on Thursday 30 January 1606 . Dragged by horse to Old St Paul 's Cathedral , Robert was the second to be executed , praying quietly to himself before he was hanged , drawn and quartered . The following morning , the remaining four were dragged to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster , opposite the building they had planned to destroy . Thomas was the first to mount the scaffold . It was customary to grant the condemned a speech , but Thomas , " a very pale and dead colour " , said it was " no time to discourse : he was come to die " . He absolved the Jesuits of any involvement in the plot , asked for Catholics to pray for him , and declared his adherence to the Roman religion . He was hanged for only a few seconds , and then taken to the block for the remainder of his grim sentence . Their half @-@ brother John was executed at Red Hill near Worcester , on 7 April . 
 = Minoan eruption = 
 The Minoan eruption of Thera , also referred to as the Thera eruption or Santorini eruption , was a major catastrophic volcanic eruption with a Volcanic Explosivity Index ( VEI ) of 6 or 7 and a dense @-@ rock equivalent ( DRE ) of 60 km3 ( 14 cu mi ) , Dated to the mid @-@ second millennium BCE , the eruption was one of the largest volcanic events on Earth in recorded history . It devastated the island of Thera ( now called Santorini ) , including the Minoan settlement at Akrotiri and communities and agricultural areas on nearby islands and the coast of Crete with a related earthquake or tsunami . 
 There are no clear ancient records of the eruption , which may have inspired certain Greek myths , caused turmoil in Egypt and be alluded to in a Chinese chronicle . 
 = = Eruption = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Geological evidence shows the Thera volcano erupted numerous times over several hundred thousand years before the Minoan eruption . In a repeating process , the volcano would violently erupt , then eventually collapse into a roughly circular seawater @-@ filled caldera , with numerous small islands forming the circle . The caldera would slowly refill with magma , building a new volcano , which erupted and then collapsed in an ongoing cyclical process . 
 Immediately prior to the Minoan eruption , the walls of the caldera formed a nearly continuous ring of islands with the only entrance lying between Thera and the tiny island of <unk> . This cataclysmic eruption was centered on a small island just north of the existing island of Nea <unk> in the centre of the then @-@ existing caldera . The northern part of the caldera was refilled by the volcanic ash and lava , then collapsed again . 
 = = = Magnitude = = = 
 Research by a team of international scientists in 2006 revealed that the Santorini event was much larger than the original estimate of 39 km3 ( 9 @.@ 4 cu mi ) of Dense @-@ Rock Equivalent ( DRE ) , or total volume of material erupted from the volcano , that was published in 1991 . With an estimated DRE in excess of 60 km3 ( 14 cu mi ) , the volume of ejecta was approximately 100 km3 ( 24 cu mi ) . If so , the eruption 's Volcanic Explosivity Index was 7 . The volcano ejected up to four times as much as the well @-@ recorded eruption by Krakatoa in 1883 . The Thera volcanic events and subsequent ashfall probably sterilized the island , as occurred on Krakatoa . Only the Mount Tambora volcanic eruption of 1815 , Lake Taupo 's <unk> eruption around 180 CE , and perhaps the Baekdu Mountain eruption around 970 CE released more material into the atmosphere during historic times . 
 = = = Sequence = = = 
 On Santorini , there is a 60 m ( 200 ft ) thick layer of white tephra that overlies the soil clearly delineating the ground level prior to the eruption . This layer has three distinct bands that indicate the different phases of the eruption . Studies have identified four major eruption phases , and one minor precursory tephra fall . The thinness of the first ash layer , along with the lack of noticeable erosion of that layer by winter rains before the next layer was deposited , indicate that the volcano gave the local population a few months ' warning . Since no human remains have been found at the Akrotiri site , this preliminary volcanic activity probably caused the island 's population to flee . It is also suggested that several months before the eruption , Santorini experienced one or more earthquakes , which damaged the local settlements . 
 Intense magmatic activity of the first major phase ( B01 / Minoan A ) of the eruption deposited up to 7 m ( 23 ft ) of pumice and ash , with a minor lithic component , southeast and east . Archaeological evidence indicated burial of man @-@ made structures with limited damage . The second ( <unk> / Minoan B ) and third ( <unk> / Minoan C ) eruption phases involved pyroclastic flow and lava fountain activity and the possible generation of tsunamis . Man @-@ made structures not buried during Minoan A were completely destroyed . The third phase was also characterized by the initiation of caldera collapse . The fourth , and last , major phase ( B04 / Minoan D ) was marked by varied activity : lithic @-@ rich base surge deposits , lahars , debris flows , and co @-@ ignimbrite ash @-@ fall deposits . This phase was characterized by the completion of caldera collapse , which produced megatsunamis . 
 = = Geomorphology = = 
 Although the fracturing process is not yet known , the altitudinal statistical analysis indicates that the caldera had formed just before the eruption . The area of the island was smaller , and the southern and eastern coastlines appeared regressed . During the eruption , the landscape was covered by the pumice sediments . In some places , the coastline vanished under thick tuff depositions . In others , recent coastlines were extended towards the sea . After the eruption , the geomorphology of the island was characterized by an intense erosional phase during which the pumice was progressively removed from the higher altitudes to the lower ones . 
 = = Volcanology = = 
 The Plinian eruption resulted in an estimated 30 to 35 km ( 19 to 22 mi ) high ash plume which extended into the stratosphere . In addition , the magma underlying the volcano came into contact with the shallow marine embayment , resulting in a violent steam eruption . 
 The eruption also generated a 35 to 150 m ( 115 to 492 ft ) high tsunami that devastated the north coast of Crete , 110 km ( 68 mi ) away . The tsunami affected coastal towns such as <unk> , where building walls were knocked out of alignment . On the island of Anafi , 27 km ( 17 mi ) to the east , ash layers 3 m ( 10 ft ) deep have been found , as well as pumice layers on slopes 250 m ( 820 ft ) above sea level . 
 Elsewhere in the Mediterranean are pumice deposits that could have been caused by the Thera eruption . Ash layers in cores drilled from the seabed and from lakes in Turkey , however , show that the heaviest ashfall was towards the east and northeast of Santorini . The ash found on Crete is now known to have been from a precursory phase of the eruption , some weeks or months before the main eruptive phases , and it would have had little impact on the island . Santorini ash deposits were at one time claimed to have been found in the Nile delta , but this is now known to be a misidentification . 
 = = Eruption dating = = 
 The Minoan eruption is a key marker for the Bronze Age chronology of the Eastern Mediterranean world . It provides a fixed point for aligning the entire chronology of the second millennium BCE in the Aegean , as evidence of the eruption is found throughout the region . Despite the evidence , the exact date of the eruption has been difficult to determine . Archaeologists have traditionally placed it at approximately 1500 BCE . Radiocarbon dates , including analysis of an olive branch buried beneath a lava flow from the volcano that gave a date between 1627 BCE and 1600 BCE ( 95 % confidence interval ) , suggest an eruption date more than a century earlier than suggested by archaeologists . Thus , the radiocarbon dates and the archaeological dates are in substantial disagreement . 
 In 2012 , one of the proponents of an archaeological date , Felix <unk> , argued that archaeological evidence could be consistent with a date as early as 1590 BCE , reducing the discrepancy to around 50 years . 
 Conversely , the radiocarbon dates have been argued to be inaccurate on scientific grounds . That argument has been made , in particular , by Malcolm H. Wiener . The primary problem is that 14C @-@ deficient carbon , sourced from the environment , might easily have affected the radiocarbon dates . 
 = = = Relative chronology = = = 
 Archaeologists developed the Late Bronze Age chronologies of eastern Mediterranean cultures by analysing the origin of artifacts ( for example , items from Crete , mainland Greece , Cyprus or Canaan ) found in each archaeological layer . If an artifact 's origin can be accurately dated , it gives a reference date for the layer in which it is found . If the Thera eruption could be associated with a given layer of Cretan ( or other ) culture , <unk> could use the date of that layer to date the eruption itself . Since Thera 's culture at the time of destruction was similar to the Late Minoan IA ( <unk> ) culture on Crete , <unk> is the baseline to establish chronology elsewhere . The eruption also aligns with Late Cycladic I ( LCI ) and Late Helladic I ( LHI ) cultures , but predates Peloponnesian LHI . Archeological digs on Akrotiri have also yielded fragments of nine Syro @-@ Palestinian Middle Bronze II ( <unk> ) gypsum vessels . 
 The Aegean prehistorians felt so confident about their calculations that they rejected early radiocarbon dates in the 1970s for <unk> / LCI Thera , as radiocarbon suggested a date about a century earlier than the traditional dates . 
 At Tell el <unk> 'a in Egypt , pumice found at this location has been dated to 1540 BCE , closer to the traditionally @-@ accepted date of Thera 's eruption . That matches the composition of the Thera eruption . This pumice has been contentious since the 1990s , as it represents the most prominent supported date to differ from the old chronology . 
 = = = Ice cores and tree rings = = = 
 Greenland ice cores show evidence of a large volcanic eruption in 1642 ± 5 BCE , which was suggested as being associated with Santorini . However , volcanic ash retrieved from an ice core does not match the expected Santorini fingerprint . The late Holocene eruption of the Mount <unk> , a volcano in Alaska , is now believed to be the source of the minute shards of volcanic glass in the Greenland ice core . 
 Another method that has been used to establish the date of eruption is tree @-@ ring dating . Tree @-@ ring data has shown that a large event interfering with normal tree growth in North America occurred during 1629 – 1628 ( ± 65 years ) BCE . Evidence of a climatic event around 1628 BCE has been found in studies of growth depression of European oaks in Ireland and of Scotch pines in Sweden . Bristlecone pine frost rings also indicate a date of 1627 BCE , supporting the late 1600s BCE dating . Procedural changes in how ice cores are interpreted would bring that data more in line with the dendrochronological numbers . 
 = = = Climatic effects = = = 
 <unk> Philip LaMoreaux asserted in 1995 that the eruption caused significant climatic changes in the eastern Mediterranean region , Aegean Sea and much of the Northern Hemisphere , but that was forcefully rebutted by volcanologist David Pyle a year later . 
 Around the time of the radiocarbon @-@ indicated date of the eruption , there is evidence for a significant climatic event in the Northern Hemisphere like failure of crops in China ( see below ) and evidence from tree rings , cited above : bristlecone pines of California ; bog oaks of Ireland , England , and Germany ; and other trees in Sweden . The tree rings precisely date the event to 1628 BCE . 
 = = Historical impact = = 
 = = = Minoan civilization = = = 
 The eruption devastated the nearby Minoan settlement at Akrotiri on Santorini , which was entombed in a layer of pumice . It is believed that the eruption also severely affected the Minoan population on Crete , but the extent of the impact is debated . Early theories proposed that ashfall from Thera on the eastern half of Crete choked off plant life , causing starvation of the local population . However , after more thorough field examinations , the theory has lost credibility , as it has been determined that no more than 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 20 in ) of ash fell anywhere on Crete . Other theories have been proposed based on archeological evidence found on Crete indicating that a tsunami , likely associated with the eruption , impacted the coastal areas of Crete and may have devastated the Minoan coastal settlements . Another theory is that much of the damage done to Minoan sites resulted from a large earthquake and the fires it caused , which preceded the Thera Eruption . 
 Significant Minoan remains have been found above the Late Minoan I era Thera ash layer and tsunami level , and it is unclear whether the effects were enough to trigger the downfall of the Minoan civilization . Some sites were abandoned or settlement systems significantly interrupted in the immediate aftermath of the eruption . As the Minoans were a sea power and depended on ships for their livelihood , the Thera eruption likely caused significant economic hardship to the Minoans . Whether the effects were enough to trigger the downfall of the civilization is intensely debated . The Mycenaean conquest of the Minoans occurred in Late Minoan II period . The Mycenaeans were a military civilization . Using their functional navy and a well @-@ equipped army , they were capable of an invasion . Mycenaean weaponry has been found in burials on Crete . That demonstrates Mycenaean military influence not many years after the eruption . Many archaeologists speculate that the eruption caused a crisis in Minoan civilization , making them vulnerable to conquest by the Mycenaeans . 
 = = = Chinese records = = = 
 A volcanic winter from an eruption in the late 17th century BCE has been claimed by some researchers to correlate with entries in Chinese records documenting the collapse of the Xia dynasty in China . According to the Bamboo Annals , the collapse of the dynasty and the rise of the Shang dynasty , approximately dated to 1618 BCE , were accompanied by " yellow fog , a dim sun , then three suns , frost in July , famine , and the withering of all five cereals " . 
 = = = Effect on Egyptian history = = = 
 Apocalyptic rainstorms , which devastated much of Egypt , and were described on the Tempest Stele of Ahmose I , have been attributed to short @-@ term climatic changes caused by the Theran eruption . The difficulty with this interpretation is that in the conventional but disputed Egyptian chronology Ahmose I ruled from c . 1539 – 1514 BC , whilst the eruption is thought to have occurred somewhere between 1642 @-@ 1540 BC . 
 Alternatively , if the eruption occurred in the Second Intermediate Period , the absence of Egyptian records of the eruption could be caused by the general disorder in Egypt around that time . 
 While it has been argued that the damage attributed to this storm may have been caused by an earthquake following the Thera Eruption , it has also been suggested that it was caused during a war with the Hyksos , and the storm reference is merely a metaphor for chaos upon which the Pharaoh was attempting to impose order . Documents such as Hatshepsut 's <unk> <unk> depict storms , but are clearly figurative not literal . Research indicates that the <unk> <unk> stele is a reference to her overcoming the powers of chaos and darkness .

 = SMS Bayern ( 1878 ) = 
 SMS Bayern was one of four Sachsen @-@ class armored frigates of the German Imperial Navy . Her sister ships were Sachsen , Baden , and Württemberg . Named for Bavaria , Bayern was built by the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel from 1874 to 1881 . The ship was commissioned into the Imperial Navy in August 1881 . She was armed with a main battery of six 26 cm ( 10 in ) guns in two open barbettes . 
 After her commissioning , Bayern served with the fleet on numerous training exercises and cruises . She participated in several cruises escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on state visits to Great Britain and to various cities in the Baltic Sea in the late 1880s and early 1890s . During 1895 – 1898 , the ship was modernized at the Schichau @-@ Werke dockyard in Danzig ; she served for another decade with the fleet before being withdrawn from active service in 1910 . She was used as a target ship after 1911 , until she was sold in 1919 and broken up for scrap . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Bayern was ordered by the Imperial Navy under the contract name " A , " which denoted that the vessel was a new addition to the fleet . She was built at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven ; her keel was laid in 1874 under construction number 3 . The ship was launched on 13 May 1878 and commissioned into the German fleet on 4 August 1881 . Along with her three sisters , Bayern was the first large , armored warship built for the German navy that relied entirely on engines for propulsion . 
 The ship was 98 @.@ 2 meters ( 322 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 18 @.@ 4 m ( 60 ft ) and a draft of 6 @.@ 32 m ( 20 @.@ 7 ft ) forward . Bayern was powered by two 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines , which were supplied with steam by eight coal @-@ fired Dürr boilers . The ship 's top speed was 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) , at 5 @,@ 600 indicated horsepower ( 4 @,@ 200 kW ) Her standard complement consisted of 32 officers and 285 enlisted men , though while serving as a squadron flagship this was augmented by another 7 officers and 34 men . 
 She was armed with six 26 cm ( 10 in ) guns , two of which were single @-@ mounted in an open barbette forward of the conning tower and the remaining four mounted amidships , also on single mounts in an open barbette . As built , the ship was also equipped with six 8 @.@ 7 cm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) L / 24 guns and eight 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss revolver cannons . Bayern 's armor was made of wrought iron , and was concentrated in an armored citadel amidships . The armor ranged from 203 to 254 mm ( 8 @.@ 0 to 10 @.@ 0 in ) on the armored citadel , and between 50 – 75 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 0 in ) on the deck . The barbette armor was 254 mm of wrought iron backed by 250 mm of teak . 
 = = Service history = = 
 After her commissioning in August 1881 , Bayern was placed in reserve . She was not activated for service with the fleet until 1884 ; this in part had to do with the poor performance of her sister Sachsen in the fleet maneuvers of 1880 . Among the problems associated with the Sachsen @-@ class ships was a tendency to roll dangerously due to their flat bottoms , which greatly reduced the accuracy of their guns . The ships were also poorly armored , compared to their contemporaries . In addition , they were slow and suffered from poor maneuverability . Nevertheless , Bayern and her three sisters served as the I Division in the 1884 fleet maneuvers , under the command of Rear Admiral Alexander von Monts . 
 Bayern remained with the fleet for the 1885 maneuvers , though she was joined only by the older ironclads Friedrich Carl and Hansa . The maneuvers were begun with a visit to Ålesund , Norway , after which the fleet went to the Baltic Sea for training exercises . Bayern was demobilized at the close of maneuvers . In October 1885 , August von Thomsen , who had been appointed chief gunner , set up the first long range gunnery experiments on Bayern . He went on to gain fame as " the father of German naval artillery . " Bayern 's three sisters and the new ironclad Oldenburg comprised the training squadron for 1886 . Bayern returned to active duty in 1888 , when she participated in a tour of the Baltic by the newly crowned Kaiser Wilhelm II . The fleet stopped in St. Petersburg , Stockholm , and Copenhagen on the seventeen @-@ day cruise . 
 Bayern participated in the ceremonial transfer of the island of Helgoland from British to German control in the summer of 1890 . She was present during the fleet maneuvers in September , where the entire eight @-@ ship armored squadron simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel . She remained with the I Division in 1891 ; the year 's maneuvers simulated a two @-@ front war against Russia and either France of Denmark . Bayern participated in the 1892 fleet maneuvers as well . Three separate simulations were conducted , which included French blockades of the German North Sea coast and a Russian attack on Kiel . Vice Admiral Wilhelm Schröder commanded the fleet maneuvers of 1893 , which simulated a protracted campaign against a superior French fleet . Bayern and her three sisters served as the Russian Baltic Fleet during the 1894 maneuvers . 
 The four Sachsen @-@ class ships were transferred to the II Division before the winter cruise of 1894 – 1895 , following the completion of the four Brandenburg @-@ class battleships . The German fleet now possessed two homogenous squadrons of four ships each . The two divisions steamed to Orkney and the Shetland Islands in the spring of 1895 . Bayern joined a massive fleet review on 21 July 1895 for the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal , which connected Kiel to the North Sea . The Autumn 1895 maneuvers simulated a high @-@ seas battle between the I and II Divisions in the North Sea , followed by combined maneuvers with the rest of the fleet in the Baltic . 
 After the conclusion of the 1895 maneuvers , Bayern was taken into drydock at the Schichau @-@ Werke in Danzig for reconstruction . The ship 's old wrought iron and teak armor was replaced with new Krupp nickel @-@ steel armor . The four funnels were trunked into a single large funnel and new engines were also installed , which increased the ship 's speed to 15 @.@ 4 kn ( 28 @.@ 5 km / h ; 17 @.@ 7 mph ) . The ship 's 8 @.@ 7 cm guns were replaced with quick @-@ firing 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) SK L / 30 guns and four 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) autocannons . Work was completed in 1898 . Bayern 's three sisters were similarly modified between 1896 and 1899 . Bayern remained with the fleet until 19 February 1910 , when the ship was stricken from the naval register . She was converted into a target ship for the fleet and served in this capacity off <unk> after 1911 . On 5 May 1919 , Bayern was sold for scrapping and broken up in Kiel .

 There has been a settlement at Faversham since pre @-@ Roman times , next to the ancient sea port on Faversham Creek , and archaeological evidence has shown a Roman theatre was based in the town . It was inhabited by the Saxons and mentioned in the Domesday book as <unk> . The town was favoured by King Stephen who established Faversham Abbey , which survived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538 . Subsequently , the town became an important seaport and established itself as a centre for brewing , and the Shepherd Neame Brewery , founded in 1698 , remains a significant major employer . 
 The town was also the centre of the explosives industry between the 17th and early 20th century , before a decline following an accident in 1916 which killed over 100 workers . This coincided with a revival of the shipping industry in the town . Faversham has a number of landmarks , with several historic churches including St Mary of Charity , Faversham Parish Church , the Maison Dieu and Faversham Recreation Ground . Faversham Market has been established for over 900 years and is still based in the town centre . There are good road and rail links , including a Southeastern service to the High Speed 1 line at Ebbsfleet International and London .

 Faversham was established as a settlement before the Roman conquest . The Romans established several towns in Kent including Faversham , with traffic through the Saxon Shore ports of Reculver , Richborough , Dover and Lympne converging on Canterbury before heading up Watling Street to London . The town was less than 10 miles from Canterbury , and consequently Faversham had become established on this road network by 50 AD following the initial conquest by Claudius in 43 AD . Numerous remains of Roman buildings have been discovered in and around Faversham , including under St Mary of Charity Church where coins and urns were discovered during reconstruction of the western tower in 1794 . In 2013 , the remains of a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old Roman theatre , able to accommodate some 12 @,@ 000 people , were discovered at a hillside near the town . The cockpit @-@ style outdoor auditorium , the first of its kind found in Britain , was a style the Romans used elsewhere in their empire on the Continent . 
 There is archaeological evidence to suggest that Faversham was a summer capital for the Saxon kings of Kent . It was held in royal demesne in 811 , and is further cited in a charter granted by Coenwulf , the King of Mercia . Coenwulf described the town as the King 's little town of <unk> , while it was recorded in the Domesday Book as <unk> . The name has been documented as meaning " the metal @-@ worker 's village " , which may derive from the Old English <unk> , which in turn comes from the Latin " <unk> " meaning " craftsman " or " forger " . The town had established itself as a seaport by the Middle Ages , and became part of the Confederation of the Cinque Ports in the 13th century , providing a vessel to Dover . The Gough Map of Britain , printed in 1360 , shows the Swale as an important shipping channel for trade . 
 = = = Middle Ages = = = 
 The manor was recorded as Terra Regis , meaning it was part of the ancient royal estates . King Stephen gave it to his chief lieutenant , William of Ypres , but soon made him swap it with <unk> ( now Higham ) so that the manor of Faversham could form part of the endowment of Faversham Abbey . Stephen established the abbey in 1148 , and is buried there with his consort Matilda of Boulogne , and his son , Eustace , the Earl of Boulogne . Stephen favoured the town because of the abbey , and so it was historically important during his reign . King John tried to give the church to Simon of Wells in 1201 , but it was owned by the monks of St Augustine 's Abbey at Canterbury , who appealed to Rome and denied the request . Abbey Street was constructed around this time in order to provide an appropriate approach to the abbey from the town . It still houses timber framed buildings and has been described as " the finest medieval street in southeast England " . 
 Sir Thomas Culpeper was granted Faversham Abbey by Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538 . Most of the abbey was demolished , and the remains of Stephen were rumoured to have been thrown into Faversham Creek . An excavation of the abbey in 1964 uncovered the empty graves . The entrance gates survived the demolition and lasted until the mid @-@ 18th century , but otherwise only a small section of outer wall survived . The abbey 's masonry was taken to Calais to reinforce defence of the town , then in British possession , against the French army . In 1539 , the ground upon which the abbey had stood , along with nearby land , passed to Sir Thomas Cheney , Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports . 
 Among the few surviving buildings of Faversham Abbey are the two barns at Abbey Farm . Minor Barn was built around 1425 ; Major Barn , the larger of the two , dates from 1476 . Next to the barns is the Abbey Farmhouse , part of which dates from the 14th century . The Abbey Guest house , on the east side of the Abbey 's Outer Gateway , has survived as Arden 's House . This house , now a private residence in Abbey Street , was the location of the murder of Thomas Arden in 1551 . The Faversham Almshouses were founded and endowed by Thomas Manfield in 1614 , with additional houses being built by Henry Wright in 1823 . 
 Due to the poor quality of roads in the Middle Ages , travel by sea was an important transport corridor . Richard <unk> ( or Tillman ) , mayor in 1581 , expanded the port at Faversham , building two wharfs . He became a key figure in exporting corn , wheat and malt to London from the town . 
 Several notable people in the Middle Ages had origins in Faversham . <unk> of Faversham was born in Faversham and later moved to Paris to join the Franciscans , becoming the " Aristotelian of <unk> " . Simon of Faversham was born in the town around the middle of the 13th century and later became Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 1304 . The notorious pirate Jack Ward is believed to have been born in Faversham around 1553 . John Wilson , lutenist and teacher was born in Faversham in 1595 who was the principal composer for the King 's Men and a professor of music at Oxford . There is now a plaque at the site of the house in Abbey Street where he was born . 
 = = = Explosives industry = = = 
 A gunpowder plant had been established around 1573 in Faversham . The town had a stream which could be dammed at intervals to provide power for watermills . It became known as the Home Works in the 18th century and was nationalised in 1759 . By the 19th century , the site stretched for around a mile along the waterfront . A second explosive works was established at Oare to the northwest of town in the late 17th century , with the Marsh Works following in 1786 . Towards the end of the 19th century , two new factories were built alongside the Swale to manage production of TNT and cordite . Faversham developed six explosive factories , and from 1874 to 1919 , the town was the centre of the explosives industry in the UK . 
 The first production of guncotton took place in the Marsh Works in 1847 . Due to a lack of experience with production methods , an explosion took place soon after work started , with several fatalities . On Sunday 2 April 1916 , an explosion occurred at one of the Swale factories in <unk> after sparks from a chimney ignited the works containing around 150 tonnes of high explosives . The incident killed over 100 people , which led to decline of the explosives industry in the town . Later accounts suggested that had the incident not happened on a Sunday , there would have been many more casualties . 
 All three gunpowder factories closed in 1934 due to the impending threat of World War II . Production was moved to <unk> in Ayrshire , Scotland , and the munition industry around Faversham is now extinct . The town is now a harbour and market community ; old sail @-@ powered Thames barges are repaired , rebuilt and moored along the creekside .

 Kent is the centre of hop @-@ growing in England , being centred on nearby Canterbury and Faversham has been the home of several breweries . The Shepherd Neame Brewery was officially founded in 1698 , though brewing activities in Faversham pre @-@ date this . The brewery claims to be the oldest in Britain and continues to be family @-@ owned . The Rigden brewery was founded in the early 18th century by Edward Rigden . It subsequently merged with the Canterbury @-@ based George Beer in 1922 to become George Beer & Rigden before being purchased by the Maidstone based <unk> . Whitbread bought out <unk> in 1967 , and closed the Faversham brewery in 1990 . The site is now a Tesco superstore . Shepherd Neame remains a significant regional brewer despite a decline in consumption of traditional bitter beer , producing around 230 @,@ 000 barrels a year . It now also makes India Pale Ale under licence . Lieutenant @-@ General Sir Philip Neame , recipient of the Victoria Cross , was born in Faversham and a memorial to him was placed in the town centre in 2014 . 
 A shipyard was established in Faversham by James Pollock & Sons ( Shipbuilders ) in 1916 at the request of Lord Fisher , the First Lord of The Admiralty , for manufacturing barges for landing craft . Faversham already had a tradition of shipbuilding , and it soon became a major contributor to markets throughout the world , producing vessels such as the <unk> and the Violette , both constructed of concrete . Over 1200 ships were built and launched from Faversham between 1916 and 1969 . 
 Faversham Market is still held in the town centre . It is now the oldest street market in Kent , dating back over 900 years . Monthly markets are also held in Preston Street and Court Street . 
 Having been an important thoroughfare since the 12th century , Abbey Street went into decline around the start of the 20th . Some buildings on the street adjoining Quay Lane were demolished in 1892 and much of the entire street was intended for demolition as recently as the 1950s , until intervention from the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . Local people began a determined fight to restore and preserve the area . Faversham has a highly active archaeological society and a series of community archaeology projects are run every year . In 2009 , evidence of the town 's medieval tannery was unearthed in back gardens of one street , and evidence from the Saxon period was uncovered during the Hunt the Saxons project between 2005 and 2007 .

 A charter was granted to the Mayor of Faversham , <unk> and Freemen of the Town of Faversham in 1546 , and regranted 1685 ; the town council was established under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 . The parliamentary constituency of Faversham was created for the 1885 general election and replaced by the new constituencies of Sittingbourne and Sheppey and Faversham and Mid Kent at the 1997 general election . The town has been represented by a Member of Parliament from the Conservative Party other than between 1945 and 1970 . Since 2015 , the constituency 's MP has been Conservative Helen Whately . 
 Faversham is within the Swale local government district . The town contains the four electoral wards of Abbey , Davington Priory , St Ann 's and Watling . The town has absorbed several former civil parishes such as Buckland @-@ by @-@ Faversham and Faversham Without , and created new parishes in the area including Graveney , <unk> , Oare and <unk> .

 = = Geography = = 
 Faversham is roughly equidistant between Sittingbourne and Canterbury . It lies 48 miles ( 77 km ) east of London , 18 miles ( 29 km ) east north east of Maidstone and 13 miles ( 21 km ) from Ashford . Nearby villages include Oare across Oare Creek to the north , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . 
 Geographically , Faversham sits at a boundary between marshland to the north and a mixture of brick earth , gravel and chalk to the south which leads into the North Downs . Faversham Creek connects the town to the Swale that separates mainland Kent from the Isle of Sheppey . The surrounding area is part of the South Swale Nature Reserve , popular with wildfowl and wading birds . The coastline around Faversham is a by @-@ product of the changes to sea level around Britain since the end of the last ice age . During Roman Britain and into the first millennium , the Faversham coast was a large estuary with Oare and Graveney being peninsulas . Land reclamation during the Middle Ages , which closed the River Wantsum and connected the Isle of Thanet to mainland Kent , resulted in less tidal waters reaching Faversham . This led to the gradual silting up of estuaries ; Faversham Creek and its tributaries have been reduced from 1 @,@ 378 acres ( 558 ha ) to 43 acres ( 17 ha ) . To stop the creek silting up completely and making navigation impossible , a number of sluices have been installed since the 16th century . 
 Faversham holds two UK weather records . The first was when the UK 's highest ever temperature was recorded on 10 August 2003 , at 38 @.@ 5 ° C ( 101 @.@ 3 ° F ) . This was the first time the temperature had ever exceeded 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) in the UK . The second was the highest UV index ever recorded , 16 ( Extreme ) on 6 June 2015 . 
 The absolute minimum temperature of − 17 @.@ 8 ° C ( 0 @.@ 0 ° F ) was set in January 1985 . 
 At the 2011 UK census , Faversham had a population of 19 @,@ 316 , an increase of 1 @,@ 606 from the 2001 census .

 Although Faversham Abbey was dissolved by Henry VIII the nearby St Mary of Charity , Faversham Parish Church remains , and has been a Grade I listed building since 1950 . The church was established in 1147 by King Stephen and Queen Matilda , with a distinctive spire added around 1794 – 97 that can be easily seen from many places around town . The interior was restored in the mid @-@ 19th century by the architect Sir George Gilbert Scott , who redesigned the nave and transepts and added a stone encasing to the spire .

 = = Transport = = 
 Faversham is close to the A2 road , a historically important route from London to Canterbury and the Channel ports . The route began as an ancient trackway which the Romans later paved and marked as Iter II ( Second Route ) on the Antonine Itinerary . The Anglo @-@ Saxons named it Wæcelinga Stræt ( Watling Street ) and it was marked as such by Matthew Paris ' Schema <unk> in 1250 . The road continued to be an important thoroughfare , and is shown next to Faversham on Philip <unk> 's map of Kent published in 1596 . 
 The A2 road still carries traffic between Sittingbourne and Canterbury , though London bound traffic now takes the M2 motorway . The A299 Thanet Way provides access to the Isle of Thanet and the <unk> Ashford Road is a local road to Ashford . The Mall is one of the main roads to the town centre from the A2 . It was built in the late 18th century as a dignified approach road , and attracted development of villas along its length . 
 Faversham railway station opened in 1858 . A former goods sheet built as part of the original railway works is now Grade I listed . Trains travel to London , terminating at either Victoria or St. Pancras International . In the other direction , trains travel either to Dover Priory ( via Canterbury East ) or to Ramsgate ( via Margate ) .

 = = Education = = 
 There has been a school in Faversham since the 12th century . Archival evidence has shown this had become a grammar school by 1420 . In 1526 , John Cole , chaplain to Henry VII and Henry VIII and Warden of All Souls College , Oxford , established a new grammar school on the estate of Ewell Farm . The property fell into disuse after the dissolution of the abbey , and a replacement grammar school was not established until 1587 . The <unk> School , a commercial school , was founded in 1856 , while a corresponding girls ' school , The Gibbs School was established in 1883 . The two boys ' schools were amalgamated in 1920 , forming Queen Elizabeth 's Grammar School . The current school dates from 1967 , when the boys and girls schools were merged , forming the first co @-@ educational grammar school in Kent . 
 The Abbey School is a Business and Enterprise Academy formed in September 1983 by the amalgamation of the Ethelbert Road Boys School and Lady Capel School for Girls . It has over 1000 pupils and is located in the south of the town , beside the A2 London Road .

 Ivan <unk> Bagramyan ( Armenian : Հովհաննես <unk> <unk> ; Russian : Ива ́ н <unk> ́ <unk> <unk> ́ н ) , also known as Hovhannes <unk> Baghramyan ( Armenian : Հովհաննես <unk> ( alternatively , <unk> , <unk> ) <unk> ; Russian : <unk> ́ с <unk> ́ <unk> <unk> ́ н ) ( 2 December [ O.S. 20 November ] 1897 – 21 September 1982 ) , was a Soviet military commander and Marshal of the Soviet Union of Armenian origin . During World War II , Bagramyan was the first non @-@ Slavic military officer to become a commander of a Front . He was among several Armenians in the Soviet Army who held the highest proportion of high @-@ ranking officers in the Soviet military during the war . 
 Bagramyan 's experience in military planning as a chief of staff allowed him to distinguish himself as a capable commander in the early stages of the Soviet counter @-@ offensives against Nazi Germany . He was given his first command of a unit in 1942 , and in November 1943 received his most prestigious command as the commander of the 1st Baltic Front . As commander of the Baltic Front , he participated in the offensives which pushed German forces out of the Baltic republics . 
 He did not immediately join the Communist Party after the consolidation of the October Revolution , becoming a member only in 1941 , a move atypical for a Soviet military officer . After the war , he served as a deputy member of the Supreme Soviets of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic and Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic and was a regular attendee of the Party Congresses . In 1952 , he became a candidate for entry into the Central Committee and , in 1961 , was inducted as a full member . For his contributions during the war , he was widely regarded as a national hero in the Soviet Union , and continues to hold such esteemed status among Armenians . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Ivan Bagramyan was born to Armenian parents in the village of <unk> , near Yelizavetpol ( modern Ganja , Azerbaijan ) , then a part of the Russian Empire . Hamazasp Babadzhanian , a fellow Armenian who was to become the chief marshal of the Soviet Armor corps , was born in the same village . While Bagramyan 's father , Khachatur , went to work all day at the railway station in Yelizavetpol , his mother , Mariam , stayed at home to take care of her seven children . Because his parents could not afford to send him to the local gymnasium , they decided to enroll him at a recently opened two @-@ year school in Yelizavetpol . 
 Graduating in 1912 , Bagramyan , whom everyone affectionately called Vanya , followed his father and his brothers in a path in rail work , attending the three @-@ year railway technical institute located in Tiflis . He graduated with honors and was slated to become a railway engineer within a few years when events in the First World War changed his life . 
 = = World War I = = 
 Bagramyan was well aware of the military situation at the Caucasus front during the first months of the world war . In the winter of 1914 @-@ 15 , the Imperial Russian Army was able to withstand and repel the Ottoman Empire 's offensive at <unk> , and to take the fight to its territory . Bagramyan also began reading harrowing reports in the Russian press of what was taking place against his fellow kinsmen across the border : the Ottomans had embarked on a campaign to annihilate systematically their Armenian subjects . He desperately attempted to join the military effort but because he was only seventeen and a railway mechanic , he was not liable to be drafted . This did not dissuade him from trying , as he later remarked , " My place was at the front . " 
 His opportunity came on 16 September 1915 , when he was accepted by the Russian Army as a volunteer . He was placed in the 116th Reserve Battalion and sent to <unk> for basic training . With his training complete in December , he joined the Second Caucasus Frontier Regiment of the Russian Expeditionary Corps , which was sent to dislodge the Ottoman Turks in Persia . Bagramyan participated in several battles in Asadabad , Hamedan and Kermanshah , the Russian victories here sending Ottoman forces reeling toward Anatolia . 
 Learning about the exploits of the men in the outfit , the chief of staff of the regiment , General Pavel Melik @-@ <unk> , advised Bagramyan to return to Tiflis to enroll in the <unk> Military Academy . But in order to attend the school , Bagramyan needed to satisfy the academy 's requirement of having completed school at a gymnasium . This did not deter him and , after preparing for the courses in Armavir , he passed his exams and began attending the academy on February 13 , 1917 . He graduated in June 1917 and was assigned to the Third Armenian Infantry regiment stationed near Lake Urmia . But with the overthrow of the Russian Provisional Government in the midst of the October Revolution of 1917 , his unit was demobilized . 
 However , with the creation of the newly established First Republic of Armenia in 1918 , Bagramyan enlisted in the Third Armenian Regiment of that country 's armed forces . From 1 April 1918 , that is , after the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk ( March 3 , 1918 ) with the Russian SFSR , he was in the First Armenian Cavalry Regiment , which put a halt to the Ottoman 3rd Army , which was bent on conquering the remains of the republic , in <unk> , <unk> and Kars . He most notably took part in the May 1918 Battle of Sardarapat , where the Armenian military scored a crucial victory against Turkish forces . He remained in the regiment until May 1920 . 
 = = Interwar years = = 
 Three years after the toppling of the Provisional Government by the Bolsheviks in October 1917 , the Red Army invaded the southern Caucasus republics of Azerbaijan , Georgia and Armenia . In May 1920 , Bagramyan , upset with the country 's social and political conditions , participated in a failed rebellion against the Dashnak @-@ led government of Armenia . He was jailed and sent to work in the fields for several months but was allowed to rejoin the military with the outbreak of the Turkish – Armenian War . But in December 1920 , Armenia was <unk> and the national army was subsequently disbanded . Bagramyan , however , chose to join the 11th Soviet Army and was appointed a cavalry regiment commander . 
 As life in Armenia grew relatively more stable under Soviet rule , Bagramyan sought to locate a woman he had met several years earlier , Tamara <unk> . Tamara , who was at this time living in Nakhichevan with her family , had been married to an Armenian officer who had been killed during the Turkish @-@ Armenian war , leaving her with their one @-@ year @-@ old son , Movses . Bagramyan visited her and the two decided to get married at the end of 1922 . In addition to their son Movses , who went on to become a painter , they had a daughter , <unk> , who later became a doctor . Tamara remained at Bagramyan 's side until her death in 1973 . 
 In 1923 , Bagramyan was appointed commander of the Alexandropol Cavalry Regiment , a position he held until 1931 . Two years later , Bagramyan graduated from the Leningrad Cavalry School and , in 1934 , from the Frunze Military Academy . In his memoirs , Pyotr Grigorenko , a Ukrainian commander who attended Frunze , recalled how Bagramyan was expelled from the academy by his superiors after they had learned that he had been a secret member of the banned Dashnak Armenian nationalist party for more than a decade . Pending his arrest , Grigorenko described Bagramyan " deeply depressed , saying he only wished they 'd arrest him soon so that he could get it over with . " Grigorenko advised that he appeal the arrest warrant which Bagramyan reluctantly did and , with the help of Armenian politburo member Anastas Mikoyan , the arrest warrant was revoked and he accepted to be " rehabilitated . " From 1934 to 1936 , he served as the chief of staff of the 5th Cavalry Division , and from 1938 , he worked as a senior instructor and lecturer at the Military Academy of the Soviet General Staff . Concurrently , Soviet leader Joseph Stalin had purged much of the Soviet officer corps of its veteran commanders . While fellow students from the military academy , Andrei <unk> and Georgy Zhukov , had seen their careers rise , Bagramyan 's had remained stagnant . 
 In 1940 , when General Zhukov was promoted to commander of the Kiev Military District in the Ukraine , Bagramyan wrote a letter asking to serve under his command . Zhukov agreed , and in December asked for his help writing a paper to be presented to the commanders of the Soviet Military Districts . Bagramyan 's paper , Conducting a Contemporary Offensive Operation , apparently impressed Zhukov , as he promoted Bagramyan to become the head of Operations for the Soviet 12th Army based in the Ukraine . Within three months however , Bagramyan , then a colonel , was appointed deputy chief of staff of the Southwestern Front , headquartered in Kiev .

 In June 1941 , Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union . Unlike many of the border troops who were caught off guard by the offensive , Bagramyan and his commander , General Mikhail Kirponos , believed an invasion by Germany was inevitable . However , Kirponos chose to ignore Bagramyan 's viewpoint that the German offensive would employ the lightning speed Blitzkrieg tactics like those seen in the campaigns in Poland in 1939 and Western Europe in 1940 . Since the winter of 1939 – 40 , Bagramyan had been busy devising a battle plan that would counter threats from the western Ukraine , which was approved after numerous revisions on 10 May 1940 . 
 On the morning of 22 June , he was tasked with the overseeing of a transfer of a military convoy to <unk> . While his column was passing the Soviet airfields near the city of Brody , German air strikes hit the aircraft on the ground . Several hours later , they arrived in <unk> , having been strafed twice by the planes . Three days after the invasion , the plans for the counter @-@ offensive were implemented , but disorder engulfed the troops , and the counter @-@ attack collapsed . Bagramyan took part in the great tank battles in western Ukraine and the defensive operation around Kiev , in which Kirponos was killed and the entire Front captured by the Germans . He was one of a handful of senior officers who escaped from the encircled Front . 
 Bagramyan was then appointed chief of staff to Marshal Semyon Timoshenko and along with future Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev , then a political officer , coordinated the fighting around Rostov . In his memoirs , Khrushchev described Bagramyan as a " very precise person who reported on everything just as it was . How many troops we had , their positions , and the general situation . " 
 Khrushchev went on to detail an account where Marshal Semyon Budyonny , sent by the chief of the operations department from Moscow as a representative of STAVKA , arrived in Kiev to <unk> Bagramyan , who vigorously protested and said that if he was an incapable staff officer , then he should instead be given a field unit to command . To Bagramyan 's astonishment , Budyonny went on to attempt to convince him to agree to his execution . Khrushchev remarked that the argument was sparked arbitrarily and had taken place after an " abundant feast with cognac " and that " in those days we didn 't take that kind of conversation seriously . " According to him , at the time however , the Soviet military was especially suspicious of the men in its ranks , itself judging that there were " enemies of the people ... everywhere , especially the Red Army . " 
 Bagramyan was instrumental in the planning of two Soviet counter @-@ offensives against the Germans , including the major push made by Soviet forces in December during the Battle of Moscow , and for this was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General . In the same month , he was made the chief of staff of a military operations group that would oversee three Army Groups : the Southern , the Southwestern and Bryansk Fronts . In March 1942 , he went along with Khrushchev and Timoshenko to Moscow to present the plans of a new counter @-@ offensive in the Ukrainian city of Kharkov to Stalin . Stalin , impressed with his plan , approved the operation and on April 8 , promoted Bagramyan as Chief of Staff of the Southwestern Front . On 12 May 1942 , armies of the Southwestern Front attacked Kharkov but the launch of the offensive came at an inopportune moment since they were attacking from the Barvenkovo Salient , a region that German forces were near closing . 
 While Soviet forces were initially successful in recapturing Kharkov , they found themselves trapped by the German army after the closing of Barvenkovo . On 18 May , Bagramyan asked Timoshenko to alter the plans but Timoshenko along with Stalin refused to approve his request . Soviet losses were heavy as the 6th , 9th and 57th armies ( approximately 18 – 20 divisions ) comprising a large portion of the Southwestern Front , were all destroyed and Bagramyan was removed from his post on 28 June by STAVKA . According to Khrushchev , Bagramyan was so devastated from the immense loss of men that after the operation was called off , " he burst into tears . His nerves cracked ... He was weeping for our army . " Held responsible for the failure of the operation and " poor staff work " , he was demoted to chief of staff of the Soviet 28th Army . Several days later , he wrote a letter to Stalin asking to " serve at the front at any capacity , however modest . " British military historian John Erickson contends that Bagramyan was unfairly scapegoated by Stalin in his attempts to " hunt for [ the ] culprits " of the mismanagement of operations . 
 = = = The 16th Army = = = 
 Though he had never led a fighting unit prior to the war , he was given his first command of an army in the Western Front as his superiors , and particularly Marshal Zhukov were impressed with his skills and capabilities as a staff officer . Zhukov , with the approval of STAVKA , appointed him commander of the 16th Army ( 2nd formation ) , ( July 1942 - April 1943 ) replacing its former commander , Konstantin Rokossovsky who had been sent to command the Bryansk Front . The 16th Army transferred its troops to the 5th Army , and its command and staff were moved to the second echelon of the Western Front were the Army took up command of part of the 10th Army 's troops , and its defensive positions . On 11 August , however , German forces mounted a surprise offensive on the southern flank of Western Front , splitting the 61st Army from the 16th Army which was not taking part in the Rzhev @-@ <unk> Offensive operation . The German forces threatened Bagramyan 's left flank as he quickly moved his forces to counter their movements and halted them from advancing further on 9 September . 
 With the rest of the Eastern Front battles almost entirely focused on Stalingrad and the Germans ' attempts to advance to the Caucasus , the 16th Army was not called up to action until February 1943 . By then , the German 6th Army besieged in Stalingrad had been encircled and surrendered . The 16th Army at the time was composed of four divisions and one infantry brigade and in light of the new offensive , Bagramyan 's force was given two extra divisions , an infantry brigade , four tank brigades and several artillery regiments . 
 = = = Kursk = = = 
 As the battle of Stalingrad marked the turning point of the war , German forces reorganized for a new offensive in the summer of 1943 to attack the Soviet held Kursk salient in Russia . The German High Command was to deploy veteran units to destroy the salient , including the Ninth Army and the II SS Panzer Corps . STAVKA , already informed of the impending offensive , called for an advance toward the German defenses positioned near the town of Kozelsk , which would drive south with the help of the armies of the Central Front . The forces would then proceed to cut off a 75 @-@ mile ( 121 km ) gap that would effectively surround the Germans and cut if off from reinforcements . This was similar to Operation Uranus , where the Soviet Army encircled and trapped the Sixth Army in Stalingrad . 
 Bagramyan 's 11th Guards Army ( the renamed 16th Army ) was tasked to take part in the offensive and was given an additional three infantry divisions and two tank corps , a force composed of fifteen divisions . Bagramyan , however , argued to STAVKA that its planning was too audacious in the hopes of repeating a successful encirclement like that in Uranus . He claimed that his forces would be overstretched and would have difficulty in attacking the entrenched German positions in <unk> . To avoid a repetition of the failure in Kharkov the previous year , he instead asked that the 61st Army from the Bryansk Front aid his 11th Guards in destroying the German forces in <unk> , thus eliminating the Ninth Army 's protection from the north . He appealed to his front commander Vasily Sokolovsky as well the Bryansk 's M. A. <unk> , both of whom rejected his proposal . In April , STAVKA recalled the main commanders of the Fronts and Armies to Moscow on a briefing of the preparations for the battle . Against the protestations of Sokolovsky and <unk> , Bagramyan proposed his alternative plan to Stalin , who agreed that it would be the more correct course to follow . Bagramyan was given twenty days to prepare the 11th Guards Army and on 24 May reported that his forces were ready . The 11th Guards now was composed of 135 @,@ 000 men , 280 armored fighting vehicles , 2 @,@ 700 artillery pieces and several hundred planes to lend air support for the ground forces . Stalin , however , felt it necessary to further wear thin the fighting abilities of the German forces and delayed the offensive . 
 Ultimately , it was the German forces on who took the initiative by launching Operation Citadel on 5 July in the area around Kursk . German losses were initially heavy due to Soviet defensive preparations . Taking advantage of this , on 12 July , Bagramyan 's forces commenced their offensive , codenamed Operation Kutuzov , and quickly breached the German defenses , advancing a distance of 45 miles ( 72 km ) by 18 July . By 28 July , the operation concluded successfully and he was promoted to the rank of Colonel @-@ General . In the following month , his forces took part in the large @-@ scale tank offensives which routed the German assaults and forced Germany to remain on the defensive for the remainder of the war . 
 = = = Belarus = = = 
 With the end of operations in Kursk , the Soviets began a series of offensives on various fronts to push the Germans out of the occupied Soviet republics . In October 1943 , Bagramyan 's 11th Guards Army was transferred to the Second Baltic Front which was concentrated on the retaking of Belarus and namely , the Baltic republics . In November , Stalin offered Bagramyan the position of head commander of the First Baltic Front which had the similar objectives of the Second but was making little headway in its attempts to advance northwards . 
 Stalin would allow him to retain the 11th Guards and suggested that Colonel @-@ General N. E. <unk> , an officer he had served under , assume his position . Bagramyan , however , commented that he had had a frictional relationship with <unk> and instead nominated Lieutenant @-@ General K. N. <unk> . Stalin , belatedly realizing that Bagramyan was implying that the two would be unable to coordinate harmoniously due to a conflict of holding the same rank , agreed to Bagramyan 's suggestion and promoted him to the rank Army General . He also agreed to have the Second Baltic Front return a tank corps and an infantry division that was taken from the 11th Guards , thus bolstering the forces under Bagramyan to a total of four armies : 11th Guards , 39th , 43rd and the 4th Shock . 
 In the winter of 1943 , his forces advanced forward towards the Belarusian city of Vitebsk . One of the key elements to Bagramyan 's success was that many of the soldiers were part of veteran units that had been trained in the Arctic regions of Siberia , enabling them to easily push through entrenched defenses the Germans had spent months preparing . Among the key locations imperative to reach Vitebsk was the small town of Gorodok , which served as a communications hub that the Germans had heavily fortified . Despite the heavy defense preparations , Bagramyan was able to utilize his heavy artillery and air support from the Red Air Force in late December to bombard the town and then launch a three @-@ pronged attack from the ground . The German garrison was overwhelmed , and by 24 December , two infantry divisions and one tank division had surrendered . In Moscow , the news of the victory at Gorodok prompted a 124 @-@ cannon salute in honor of Bagramyan and the First Baltic Front . 
 On 2 April 1944 Stalin granted Bagramyan 's request to relieve the troops of the Front of offensive duties . However , German forces took this to their advantage as they mounted a new offensive against Soviet partisan fighters in Belarus . Bagramyan 's senior staff diverted air support and other crucial supplies to aid the partisans , allowing most of them to escape the German encirclement . With the advance of Soviet forces in the Baltic and the Ukraine , German Army Group Center had largely been isolated as STAVKA prepared to eliminate the pocket ( consisting of Third Panzer , Second , Fourth , and Ninth Armies ) . STAVKA 's plan , codenamed Operation Bagration was kept secret from all of the involved Front commanders . Bagramyan himself was only informed in May 1944 of his role in the offensive . 
 Bagration called for the First , Second and Third Belorussian and the First Baltic Fronts to engulf Army Group Center . Bagramyan was tasked with attacking the forces in the pocket , cross the Daugava River and , along with Third Belorussian , clear the surrounding areas of Vitebsk of German forces . Although he felt the plans for the Bagration were sound , he worried about the possibility of a German incursion by Army Group North against his forces from the north . He appealed to his superiors once more , Zhukov and Alexander Vasilevsky , to have the First Baltic Front move westward to help eliminate the Third Panzer Army , thus splitting Army Group North in two . Zhukov and Vasilevsky accepted his argument , introducing it to Stalin in a meeting on 23 May who formally approved it in a directive on 31 May . 
 Although Bagramyan found it acceptable to sustain heavy casualties ( as did all the commanders of the Red Army ) , he was disturbed with the immense loss of life his forces were sustaining . He , however , attempted to reduce those levels primarily by maintaining the element of surprise in operations . In his preparations for Bagration , he planned for the 43rd Army to move through the more geographically difficult swamps and marshlands to Army Group North 's right flank . This maneuver would thus take North by surprise since it expected the Soviet offensive to move through more suitable terrain . He proved correct , as in early June 1944 , the 43rd achieved success in its attack . Commander of the 43rd Army , General Afanasy <unk> , wrote that during the offensive they apprehended a German general who stated that German forces had been blindsided by the attacking forces . 
 As Bagramyan pushed towards Vitebsk , his forces were aided by the same Belorussian guerrilla fighters who had escaped the German encirclement in April . They provided vital intelligence , including information on the location of bridges and troop movements , and launched attacks against German logistic lines . On 22 June 1944 , Bagration began as Bagramyan proceeded in moving westwards as previously planned . However , a widening gap on the Front 's northern flank grew as it advanced while the Second Baltic Front , tasked to help defend that area , took no action . Stalin agreed to send a tank corps to reinforce Bagramyan 's forces but ordered him to capture Polotsk , which would sever Army Group North 's communication lines and open up a route towards the central Baltic . By 3 July , his troops had accomplished the tasks set forth in the directive , destroyed the Third Panzer Army and captured Polotsk . For his achievements , on 7 July he was decorated with the title of Hero of the Soviet Union . 
 = = = The Baltics = = = 
 With the overall success of Soviet forces in Bagration , his Front was expanded by three armies ( although he ceded the 4th Shock Army to Second Baltic ) , the 39th Army ( previously under the command of Third Belorussian ) , the 51st and the 2nd Guards Armies . The First Baltic Front was ordered by STAVKA to move westward in order to stop Army Group North 's remaining forces from escaping to Germany . Despite this , Bagramyan understood that many of the general orders being given to the German Army were directed by Adolf Hitler , rather than the General Staff , and knew that while there was a possibility that they would confront them in the Lithuanian city of Kaunas , he felt the more likely location would be in Latvia 's capital , Riga . He spoke with Vasilevsky who agreed to change the plans if his theory and intuition proved correct . 
 As the First Baltic began moving towards Lithuania and into eastern Latvia , it became clear that Army Group North would attempt to outflank Bagramyan 's forces near Daugavpils , as he had previously predicted . Vasilevsky , keeping his promise , appealed to Stalin to allow Bagramyan to move to Daugavpils but he refused to do so . Vasilevsky in turn , took it upon his own initiative and gave Bagramyan the go ahead . However , with the loss of 4th Shock Army , Bagramyan was left shortchanged since his promised 39th Army had not only not arrived but was composed of only seven divisions ( in comparison to 4th Shock 's ten ) . Feeling that time was being lost , he pressed on with the units he had . 
 By 9 July , his ground forces had made significant gains in cutting off a vital road that connected Kaunas to Daugavpils . Taking advantage of this , Bagramyan worked with other Front commanders to attack the rear guard of Army Group Center but poor coordination between the units led a stall in the advance . At this time , Bagramyan realized that German forces were most probably not going to easily retreat from the Baltics and so further advances towards Kaunas would be pointless . He proposed to STAVKA to launch a full @-@ scale offensive towards Riga but the former rejected his plans , stating that the armies of Second and Third Baltic Fronts would have already pushed Army Group Center to Prussia by the time of the offensive . He attempted to convince them otherwise , citing the numerically deficient forces in the two Fronts , but was rebuffed and ordered to drive towards a road connecting the Lithuanian city of Šiauliai to Riga , resulting in its capture in late July . 
 With its capture , he persuaded Vasilevsky to allow his forces to move towards Riga , receiving a formal go @-@ ahead by STAVKA in a directive on 29 July . On 30 July , his forces finally reached the seaside city of Tukums , near the Bay of Riga , thereby cutting off a total of 38 German infantry and armored divisions in Latvia . For his achievements in this battle , he was given the title of Hero of the Soviet Union . During the month of August , Soviet forces stalled in the Riga offensive , concentrating on halting German attacks . Finally on 14 September 1944 , the First , Second and Third Baltic Fronts launched full @-@ scale offensives with the objective of Riga , encountering fierce resistance by its defenders . On 24 September , with his forces only 12 miles ( 19 km ) from Riga , STAVKA ordered Bagramyan 's forces to abandon it to the Second and Third Baltic Fronts , regroup , and instead advance against Memel . His forces attacked Memel on 5 October and on 10 October , reached the city , effectively preventing Army Group North from retreating to Prussia . 
 In early 1945 , Bagramyan 's army , under the overall command of <unk> , took part in the advance into East Prussia . In Operation Samland , Bagramyan 's First Baltic Front , now known as the Samland Group , captured Königsberg ( now Kaliningrad ) in April . On 9 May 1945 , he accepted the surrender of the German forces penned up in Latvia , capturing a total of 158 aircraft , 18 @,@ 000 vehicles , 500 tanks and assault guns among other weaponry . 
 = = Career after World War II = = 
 After the war , Bagramyan remained in command of the Baltic Military District , commanding operations against partisans in Lithuania and Latvia . In 1954 , he was appointed Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense . In 1955 , he was appointed Deputy Minister of Defense with the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union . He was also head of the Military Academy of General Staff and commander of the reserve forces of the Soviet Armed Forces . 
 He spent much of his time writing articles in military journals on Soviet strategic operations and most notably , co @-@ authored the six @-@ volume work on Soviet involvement during World War II , The Soviet Union 's Great Patriotic War ( 1941 – 1945 ) . In August 1967 , Bagramyan accompanied General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev and premier Alexei Kosygin to North Vietnam , where they met with Vietnamese leaders as he , serving in the role of a military expert , helped negotiate the transfer of logistics and arms to the country during the Vietnam War . 
 He retired in 1968 . In 1971 , Bagramyan completed his first volume of his memoirs in This is How the War Began in 1971 and in 1977 the second volume , Thus We Went to Victory , was published . Among the numerous points he noted in the second book was an analysis of the Red Army 's costly offensives in the early stages of the war : 
 There is no point in hiding that before the war we mostly learned to attack , and did not pay enough attention to such an important manoeuvre as retreat . Now we have paid for this . It turned out that the commanders and the staff were not sufficiently prepared to prepare and execute the retreat manoeuvre . Now , in the second week of war , we had in fact to learn from the beginning the most difficult art - the art of the execution of retreat . 
 In 1980 , another book of Bagramyan entitled My Memoirs was published and was based on the first and second volumes . A large portion of the book was dedicated to the Armenian issues including the territories of Western Armenia , massacres of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire and the Armenian Genocide , the Ottoman invasion of Armenia and the Battle of Sardarapat , as well as other topics . 
 Marshal Bagramyan was awarded with numerous Soviet and foreign orders and medals for his service , including two Orders of the Hero of the Soviet Union , seven Orders of Lenin , the Order of the October Revolution , three Orders of the Red Banner , two Orders of Suvorov and the Order of Kutuzov . Among the other commendations he received were the Polish Virtuti Militari , the Medal For the Victory Over Germany and the Medal " For the Victory over Japan " . 
 After the death of Marshal Vasily Chuikov on 18 March 1982 , he was the last surviving Soviet Marshal who held a high command in World War II . However , Bagramyan was ill and died a few months later , on 21 September 1982 , at the age of 84 . He was buried with full military honors at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Moscow . A town in Armenia ( 40 @.@ <unk> ° N 44 @.@ <unk> ° E ﻿ / 40 @.@ <unk> ; 44 @.@ <unk> ) , a military firing range , an Armenian Army training brigade , and a subway station and street in the capital of Armenia , Yerevan , are named in his honor . On 11 May 1997 , the government of Armenia established the commemorative 100th Anniversary of Marshal Bagramyan medal . It is awarded to service and civilian personnel who participated in the Second World War . 
 According to the Soviet laws , a monument made out of bronze had to be erected in the birthplace of a recipient of two orders of the Hero of the Soviet Union . The one that was erected in <unk> village for Bagramyan was destroyed by Azerbaijanis after the Karabakh movement broke out . His brother Aleksey <unk> Bagramyan 's grave was also desecrated in Fakhri <unk> ( The Alley of Honor ) cemetery , which is located in present @-@ day Baku , Azerbaijan .

 In 2009 , producer Chuck Harmony and singer @-@ songwriter Ne @-@ Yo convened together to conceptualize a song that would take Rihanna 's music to a further level . According to Harmony , they didn 't wanted to re @-@ work the previous efforts by Rihanna — something that according to him the fans expected . The producer told MTV News that they wanted to give Rihanna a film , not just a song with a length of three minutes , " I felt musically like everybody was gonna give like that ' Disturbia , ' ' SOS , ' kind of pop , uptempo stuff , and I really wanted the song that me and Ne @-@ Yo did to stand out . " 
 Following a domestic violence case between Rihanna and her boyfriend American entertainer Chris Brown , media speculated as to whether any song featured on her fourth upcoming album would be about him . In an interview with MTV News , Ne @-@ Yo clarified that he would not write a song for Rihanna about Brown , because he considered the idea unnecessary . Harmony said that no matter what song Rihanna released as a lead single from the album , it would be looked at as a song about Brown . 
 In an interview with the same publication , Ne @-@ Yo explained how he wrote the lyrics , " I 'm listening to the track , and all I can see is Rihanna and some random person sitting across from each other at the table with a gun sitting in the middle of the table and playing Russian roulette . " Ne @-@ Yo further stated that Rihanna is not afraid to trying new things and from the first moment she heard the song he knew she would like it , " I trust Rihanna to be Rihanna , and she trusts me to be me . That 's the coolest thing about our relationship . I must say this song is a step in somewhat of a different direction for both of us . " When Harmony heard the song , both he and Ne @-@ Yo were aware that they should change some elements and that it had to be darker and edgier . 
 " Russian Roulette " was recorded during the summer 2009 , at the Roc the Mic Studios in New York City by Marcos Tovar . <unk> Alexander was the assistant recorder while Makeba Riddick made the vocal production of the song .

 On October 14 , 2009 , a black metal " R " along with a message saying " The Wait is Over " was placed on Rihanna 's official website . Subsequently , Rihanna posted on her official Twitter profile " # The Wait Is Ova . Nov. 23 09 " . Speculation rose among fans that " The Wait Is Ova " , literally meaning " The wait is over " , would either be the name of a new single or the then @-@ upcoming album . According to Entertainment Weekly the date looked accurate for her album release and " The Wait Is Ova " would not be the title of the album . Two days later , a countdown timer appeared on her website and was scheduled to end on October 20 , 2009 . After the timer finished counting , " Russian Roulette " premiered on BBC Radio 1 , the singer 's official website and on American radio stations . The artwork for the single features Rihanna posing topless with a strip wire around her chest and wearing an eye patch " that completes the angry look " . 
 Def Jam Recordings serviced the song to contemporary , rhythmic and urban radio in the United States on October 27 , 2009 as the lead single from Rated R. In an interview with NME , Rihanna explained that she and her management didn 't have doubts if " Russian Roulette " should be the lead single as it was very personal and emotional track to her . On November 3 , the single was released for a digital download via iTunes Store worldwide .

 " Russian Roulette " is a mid @-@ tempo pop and R & B ballad that contains dark , haunting , morbid , and tense atmospheric elements . The song has an instrumentation consisted of guitars , piano and synths which play over a " heart beat " bass line and is accompanied with Rihanna 's " affecting " vocals . Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine wrote that the song 's production is also decorated with the sound of a rolling dice . According to Jon <unk> of The New York Times " Russian Roulette " " is paced by a heartbeat , a ticking clock and Rihanna 's fearful voice . " The single is written in the key of F ♯ minor , in common time , with a tempo of 83 beats per minute . Rihanna 's vocal range spans from F ♯ 3 to C5 . Chicago Tribune 's Greg Kot called the singer 's voice a " delicate instrument " that is often the least element in her song 's production , however , he noted that on the song " she 's squarely in the center of the action " . 
 Lyrically , " Russian Roulette " is about an abusive romantic relationship that ends abruptly , with some critics comparing them to the relationship that Rihanna had with Brown . Kot noted that the single 's lyrics compare a relationship to a fatal game of choice , while Andy Jill of The Independent wrote that the its title refers to a " state of relationships " . Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice described the song as a spare , suspenseful , violent torch song with a literal title . Los Angeles Times ' Todd Martens wrote that although the song 's lyrics are vague and find people speculating , they " hint at a situation one probably doesn 't want to be in the middle of " . Sasha Resende of The Michigan Daily wrote " the ballad , which employs reckless gunplay as a not @-@ so @-@ subtle metaphor for a troubled relationship , achieves its seemingly morbid intent . " 
 " Russian Roulette " begins with a " searing " guitar solo that later transitions into a " pulsing " beat which stays constant until the end of the song . The single opens with the lyrics , " Take a breath / Take it deep / Calm yourself / He says to me / If you play / You play for keeps / Take the gun / And count to three . " The metaphor about the game of Russian roulette is also present in the chorus in which Rihanna sings , " And you can see my heart beating / You can see it through my chest / I said I 'm terrified , but I 'm not leaving / I know that I must pass this test / So just pull the trigger . " In the upcoming verse , the character that the singer portrays in the song it 's scared that the man talking to her will always have a power over , " Say a prayer to yourself / He says close your eyes / Sometimes it helps / And then I get a scary thought / That he 's here means he 's never lost . " " Russian Roulette " ends with a sound of a gun shot , which according to Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club extends the drama accompanied by " harrowing scenarios and tremulous vocals " .

 Nick Levine of Digital Spy praised " Russian Roulette " and called it a " masterful return effort " . He additionally wrote that the single is " brave , brilliantly @-@ realized and bizarre enough to distance " the singer from the other pop or R & B performers like Lady Gaga . According to Levine , the song is her best vocal performances and shows Rihanna growing in front of the audience 's eyes .

In November 2009 , Rihanna appeared on " TV total " in Germany to talk about her new album and preview 30 seconds of the video for the song . Mandler spoke to MTV News , stating " I think that with this song and the meaning of this song and how loaded it all is , no pun intended , how much imagery and perhaps symbolism that is loaded in this song , the only way to do it was to do something that was visually challenging " . The music video for the song premiered on ABC 's 20 / 20 on November 13 , 2009 . 
 The music video opens with shots of Rihanna hooded , lying on the floor of a gas chamber .

 = Frank Fetter = 
 Frank Albert Fetter ( / <unk> / ; March 8 , 1863 – March 21 , 1949 ) was an American economist of the Austrian School . Fetter 's treatise , The Principles of Economics , contributed to an increased American interest in the Austrian School , including the theories of Eugen von Böhm @-@ <unk> , Friedrich von Wieser , Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek . 
 Fetter notably debated Alfred Marshall , presenting a theoretical reassessment of land as capital . Fetter 's arguments have been credited with prompting mainstream economists to abandon the Georgist idea " that land is a unique factor of production and hence that there is any special need for a special theory of ground rent .... " A proponent of the subjective theory of value , Fetter emphasized the importance of time preference and rebuffed Irving Fisher for abandoning the pure time preference theory of interest that Fisher had earlier espoused in his 1907 book , The Rate of Interest . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Frank Fetter was born in Peru , Indiana to a Quaker family during the height of the American Civil War . Fetter proved an able student as a youth , as demonstrated by his acceptance to Indiana University in 1879 when he was only sixteen years old . At Indiana , he joined the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity . Fetter was on track to graduate with the class of 1883 , but left college to run his family 's bookstore upon news of his father 's declining health . Working in the bookstore offered an opportunity for the young man to acquaint himself with some of the economic ideas that would later prove formative . Chief among the intellectual influences Fetter encountered at this time was Henry George 's Progress and Poverty ( 1879 ) . 
 After eight years , Fetter returned to academia and finally completed his B.A. in 1891 . In 1892 , Jeremiah W. Jenks — who had taught Fetter at Indiana University — acquired a teaching position at Cornell University at the new President White School of History and Political Science and subsequently secured a fellowship for Fetter at that institution . Fetter completed his Master of Philosophy degree the same year . Jenks then convinced Fetter to study , as Jenks himself had , under Johannes Conrad at the Sorbonne in Paris , France . Fetter earned his Ph.D. in 1894 from the University of Halle in Germany , where he wrote his doctoral dissertation , a critique of Malthusian population theory . 
 = = Professional life = = 
 After earning his doctoral degree , Fetter accepted an <unk> at Cornell , but quickly left after being offered a position as a professor at Indiana University . In 1898 , Stanford University lured him away from Indiana , but Fetter resigned from Stanford three years later over a dispute regarding academic freedom . After leaving Stanford in 1901 , Fetter went back to Cornell , where he remained for ten years . In 1911 , he again found himself in professional transition , accepting the position of chairman in an interdisciplinary department at Princeton University which incorporated history , politics , and economics . Fetter was the first chairman of Princeton University 's Department of Economics and Social institutions . 
 Despite his ideological proximity and personal rapport with eminent Austrian School economists such as Eugen von Böhm @-@ <unk> and Friedrich von Wieser , as well as his favorable reviews of works by Ludwig von Mises and F.A. Hayek , Fetter referred to himself , Thorstein Veblen , and Herbert J. Davenport more specifically as being members of the " American Psychological School . " The appellation " Psychological School " is now generally considered to be synonymous with " Austrian School . " 
 Fetter was a staunch opponent of Franklin D. Roosevelt 's plan to end the gold standard and worked with other economists in lobbying against the move to a fiat currency . As some indication of Fetter 's role in these efforts , 
 In January 1933 , a letter was sent to the president @-@ elect , urging him not only to lower tariff barriers to revive international trade , but to maintain the gold standard " unflinchingly . " The letter was signed by a number of prominent " traditional " economists , headed by the American " Austrian , " Frank A. Fetter , of Princeton .

 Fetter participated in a notable debate with English economist Alfred Marshall , both through his 1904 Principles of Economics and a number of journal articles in the American Economic Association 's journals and in the Quarterly Journal of Economics . He contested Marshall 's position that land is theoretically distinct from capital . Fetter argued that such a distinction was impractical , stating that , 
 The notion that it is a simple matter to distinguish between the yield of natural agents and that of improvements is fanciful and confusing .... The objective classification of land and capital as natural and artificial agents is a task that always must transcend the human power of discrimination . 
 Fetter 's stand on this issue further led him to oppose Georgist ideas like the land value tax . Mark Blaug , a specialist in the history of economic thought , credits Fetter and John Bates Clark with influencing mainstream economists to abandon the idea " that land is a unique factor of production and hence that there is any special need for a special theory of ground rent .... This is in fact the basis of all the attacks on Henry George by contemporary economists and certainly the fundamental reason why professional economists increasingly ignored him . " 
 = = = Applications of subjective value theory = = = 
 Fetter believed in the subjective theory of value , and thus supported a pure time preference theory of interest . Richard Ebeling wrote that Fetter " constructed a consistent theory of value , price , cost , and production in the context of emphasizing the time @-@ <unk> element in all consumption and production choices . " According to Jeffrey Herbener , Fetter asserted that " just as the price of each consumer good is determined solely by subjective value , the rate of interest is determined solely by time preference . " 
 Likewise , Herbener explains , this led Fetter to also conclude that " [ t ] he rental price of each producer good is imputed to it by entrepreneurial demand and is equal to its discounted marginal value product . The capital value of each durable good is equal to the discounted value of its future rents . " Fetter 's contribution to the Austrian subjectivist tradition , then , is that he " showed how this uniform , subjective theory of value implies the demise of socialist theories of labor exploitation , Ricardian theories of rent , and productivity theories of interest . "

 In " Interest Theories , Old and New " ( 1914 ) , Fetter criticized Irving Fisher for abandoning the pure time preference theory of interest that Fisher had earlier espoused in his 1907 book , The Rate of Interest , a tome which had heavily influenced Fetter . As Murray Rothbard recounts , upon further review of Fisher 's earlier work , 
 ... Fetter discovered that the seeds of error were in Fisher 's publication of 1907 . Fisher had stated that valuations of present and future goods imply a preexisting money rate of interest , thereby suggesting that a pure time @-@ preference explanation of interest involves circular reasoning . By way of contrast , and in the course of explaining his own pure time @-@ preference , or " capitalization , " theory of interest , Fetter showed that time valuation is prerequisite to the determination of the market rate of interest . 
 = = Reception in academia = = 
 In 1909 , at the age of forty @-@ six , Fetter was awarded an honorary LL.D. from Colgate University , and he was made president of the American Economic Association in 1913 . Additional honorary doctoral degrees were conferred on Fetter by Occidental College in 1930 and Indiana University in 1934 . He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the American Philosophical Society . In 1927 , he was awarded the Karl Menger Medal by the Austrian Economic Society . 
 Fetter 's treatise , Principles of Economics ( 1904 ) , has been described by Herbener as " unsurpassed until Ludwig von Mises 's treatise of 1940 , <unk> . " In Rothbard 's preface to the 1977 edition of Fetter 's Capital , Interest , and Rent , he notes that he was first introduced to Fetter 's work via a citation in Mises ' Human Action and describes Fetter 's views on interest and rent as being " Austrian " and influential on his own views . 
 ... while reading Fetter 's oeuvre in the course of writing my Man , Economy , and State ... I was struck by the brilliance and consistency of his integrated theory of distribution and by the neglect of Fetter in current histories of economic thought , even by those that are Austrian oriented . For Fetter 's systematic theory , while challenging and original ( particularly his theories of interest and rent ) , was emphatically in the Austrian school tradition . 
 Upon Fetter 's death in 1949 , J. Douglas Brown , who would later be named Provost of Princeton University , wrote a " Memorial " to Fetter for the American Economic Review . He opened the tribute with the announcement that " with the death of Frank Albert Fetter the great company of American economists has suffered an irreparable loss . "
