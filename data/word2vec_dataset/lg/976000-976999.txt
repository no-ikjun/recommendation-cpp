 = Hurricane Barry ( 1983 ) = 
 Hurricane Barry was the fourth tropical depression , second hurricane and named storm of the inactive 1983 Atlantic hurricane season . Developing out of a tropical wave on August 23 , Barry quickly strengthened off the coast of Florida , reaching an initial peak intensity with winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . However , increased wind shear caused the storm to weaken to a tropical depression before making landfall near Melbourne , Florida , the next morning . Traveling almost due west , the storm regenerated and became a hurricane on August 28 . The storm made landfall on the northern Mexican coastline later that day at peak intensity . Rapid weakening followed shortly after and the storm dissipated the next day . The storm had only minor effects in the United States but destroyed hundreds of homes and left over 400 homeless in northern Mexico . Despite the damage , there were no reports of fatalities or injuries . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Hurricane Barry can be traced to a tropical wave which moved off the western coast of Africa on August 13 , 1983 . Strong wind shear in the North Atlantic hurricane basin prevented significant development of the system as it traveled towards the west @-@ northwest . Little convection was associated with the disturbance as a result of the shear . While approaching the Bahamas on August 22 , an upper @-@ level trough moved away from the system , which led to a decrease in the wind shear . The disturbance then entered this environment and spawned an area of low pressure which intensified . On August 23 , the low had become sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Four . Later that day , the depression quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and was given the name Barry by the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) . About 12 hours after becoming a tropical storm , Barry reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . 
 Barry then began a westerly course towards central Florida . However , wind shear began to increase , causing the system to weaken . The NHC downgraded the storm back to a tropical depression on August 25 . Barry made landfall near Melbourne , Florida the same morning with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . After crossing Florida , the depression traveled towards the west @-@ southwest due to a strong upper @-@ level flow . On August 27 , Barry became sufficiently organized to be reclassified as a tropical storm while located in the central Gulf of Mexico . The re @-@ strengthening was the result of decreased wind shear and more favorable conditions over the Gulf . The storm continued to become better organized as it traveled nearly due west towards Mexico . At 1200 UTC the next day , Barry was upgraded to a hurricane while located about 75 mi ( 120 km ) southeast of Brownsville , Texas . The hurricane continued to intensify until it made landfall about 35 mi ( 55 km ) south @-@ southeast of Brownsville at peak intensity with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . The storm quickly weakened after landfall and dissipated the next day over northern Mexico .

 Several watches and warnings were issued along the Florida and Texas coastlines as a result of Barry . The first was a gale warning from Jupiter Inlet , Florida to Savannah , Georgia on August 24 at 1900 UTC . The warning was discontinued from St. Augustine to Savannah the next day . The next was a gale warning issued for Brownsville , Texas to Port O 'Connor , Texas on August 27 . This was upgraded into a hurricane warning as Barry strengthened a few hours later , and then extended to Mansfield . The warning was discontinued by late August 28 . Over 4 @,@ 000 people were evacuated from South Padre Island in preparation of Hurricane Barry . Several thousand people were evacuated from beaches in Port Aransas on August 27 as Barry approached . An estimated 700 people took refuge in shelters set up in Brownsville and 800 people fled to schools , which were being used as temporary shelters , in Harlingen . An additional 2 @,@ 000 residents evacuated from Harlingen . Shelters were also opened in San Benito , Santa Rosa , and Los <unk> . Offshore , several oil platforms were evacuated in the Gulf of Mexico .

Barry also affected the launch of the Space Shuttle Challenger , whose third mission was scheduled for August 30 . NASA ( National Aeronautics and Space Administration ) did not have time to return the shuttle to the hangar in time for the storm and had the shuttle ride out the storm on the launch pad . The only rainfall reported in Texas by Barry was 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) around San Antonio . Along the Texas coast , beach erosion was caused from waves that were 1 to 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 30 to 0 @.@ 61 m ) higher than normal . Winds were gusting in excess of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) off the South Padre Island coast .

At least ten people were left homeless in the town of El Mezquital . Homes in Santa Teresa sustained some damage but none were destroyed . Only one person was injured by the storm after shards from a broken window hit the child .

After assuming rule over the city and avenging his father 's death , the protagonist embarks on a quest to unify the land through conquest . <unk> this goal entails developing cities , recruiting armies , and directing the troops on the fields of battle to victory . First published on the DOS platform during the emergence of electronic wargaming , the game was also ported to Amiga machines . Reception towards Sword of Aragon tended to be more positive than negative ; reviewers called it an exciting game , but criticized its method of copy protection and cited problems with its documentation . There were also opinions that the game was more of a niche product , catering to hardcore strategists . 
 = = Background = = 
 Sword of Aragon is a " strategic fantasy role @-@ playing adventure " video game published in 1989 . The game 's setting is the fictional land of Aragon . A powerful human empire once held sway over the land , but infighting and raids by monsters such as orcs , goblins , and titans have broken it apart . The protagonist is the son of the Duke of <unk> , ruler of a city that used to be glorious under the old empire . The duke died during a raid by orcs and tasked his son through his will to fulfill his dream of reunifying the land . To achieve this goal , the young duke builds up his cities and expands his army , conquering or allying with other cities and races . Furthermore , he recovers three artifacts required to claim the throne , slays a dragon , and destroys the strongholds of monsters that plague the land . Eventually , he deposes the ruthless Emperor of the <unk> Empire , <unk> IV , and assumes the <unk> throne . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The player begins a game by choosing a character class for the protagonist . The choices are warrior , knight , mage , priest , and ranger . Each class has an affinity to a certain class of soldier — warriors are more apt in leading infantry , and knights , cavalry . During battles , mages , rangers , and priests can also cast spells that damage foes , alter terrain , and heal friendly forces . The player can hire commanders of these classes to accompany the protagonist in his quest . After winning a number of battles , the player 's character might receive offers of service from such commanders as well . 
 The game is principally split between city management and tactical combat . Gameplay is turn @-@ based , alternating between player and computer , and much of the game is played on the World Map , a representation of the land of Aragon . Each turn on this map represents a month in the game . The map shows cities and the player 's units ; unexplored areas are blanked out until they have been explored by the player 's units . By using the keyboard and mouse , the player moves a cursor to select units and cities , and issue orders via keystrokes . Cities under the player 's control provide monthly income , which is supplemented by tributes from vassals and loot from battles . Income from a city is improved by expending funds to develop the city 's economic sectors , such as agriculture and mining , or by increasing taxation . Tax rates , however , affect the loyalty of citizens ; high taxes in a city lead to a decreasing population . 
 Armies are recruited in the cities , and their maintenance contributes to the monthly expenditure . Troops consist of infantry , cavalry , and bowmen . The game enters the tactical battle phase when enemies attack one of the player 's cities that is garrisoned with troops , and when the player 's forces move onto a hostile city . Encounters might also take place as the player 's forces move on the World Map . On such occasions , the game switches the display to a large @-@ scale map of the encounter . The battle maps differ from the World Map in that each spot has a limit on its number of occupants — a stacking limit . The player and computer take turns to deploy and move their forces . Units move at their standard pace or at a forced march to cover greater distances per turn in battles . Certain terrain gives defensive bonuses to their occupants , reducing the damage they suffer when coming under attack . Offensives take the form of melee , charges , missiles , and magic . The player has the option of letting the computer take control of his or her army to fight the battle . The game switches back to the World Map after a battle has concluded . Units that survive a battle gain experience points , improving their combat abilities on attaining certain amounts of experience points . They , with the exception of commanders , can also train in cities to improve their experience . Video games designer Alan Emrich considered Sword of Aragon 's gameplay typical of the " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> " nature of the 4X genre . 
 = = Development = = 
 Sword of Aragon was developed and published by Strategic Simulations , Inc . , a video game company that dominated the 1980s market for digital wargames . Their products typically " copied the board game formula without adding revolutionary new elements . " Most strategy games at this time featured hexagon @-@ based maps and a sequence of turns among players . Sword of Aragon plainly exhibits the influence of traditional board games in its design . Its maps are laid out in hexes , and the concept of stacking limits plays a strong part in the game 's strategies . Written in Microsoft <unk> and other languages , Sword of Aragon features a copy protection system that uses the game manual . On starting the game , the icon of an <unk> city is displayed , along with a cue for a word in the manual 's description of that city ; a separate poster identifies the cities with their icons . The game proceeds only after the correct answer has been entered .

 Sword of Aragon was released when fantasy @-@ themed wargames were gaining popularity and computer wargames were starting to flourish as the rules of the board games grew in complexity . The digital versions were simpler in terms of their gameplay , as parts of the complex mechanics were handled by computers instead . Freed of dice rolling , complex calculations , and coordination of the sequence of play , casual gamers were more amenable to playing these games . According to Advanced Computer Entertainment 's John Minson , Sword of Aragon complied with part of this trend ; its huge complicated set of rules would have made it an unplayable board game , but by hiding its mechanics from the player , the digital version could be played by anyone . However , as Minson further explained , the scope of the game was too large for casual gamers to handle , overwhelming them with " the number of factors under their control " , and hardcore gamers are more likely to appreciate the game 's complexity . 
 The Lessers of Dragon magazine believed that while the game was exciting , it suffered several design flaws that made the game too difficult for them . The computer @-@ controlled enemies constantly outpaced their economy and military might , and the game gave them no immediate opportunity to retreat their army when ambushed by superior forces , forcing them to suffer heavy losses . Conversely , Compute ! ' s Adam Starkweather found it too easy in later stages of the game , as his character 's well @-@ developed armies " <unk> " their way through the opposition . The Lessers and Amiga Joker 's Werner <unk> felt the game ran slow on their computers , while Starkweather reflected that battles could take up to one and a half hours to complete . In 1990 and 1993 Computer Gaming World gave the game three @-@ plus stars out of five , stating that it had " high playability " . 
 Several video game observers doubted the classification of Sword of Aragon as a role @-@ playing game . Science fiction and fantasy novelist Orson Scott Card and Amiga Computing 's Lucinda Orr considered it more of a strategy than a role @-@ playing game . Minson was of like mind , and further elaborated that unlike the Dungeon and Dragon series of video games , Sword of Aragon failed to inspire players to identify themselves with the characters , giving a " coldly mechanical experience " instead . Datormagazin 's Hans Ekholm thought otherwise . He said the gameplay did not require any strategy , and considered Sword of Aragon " a fantasy role @-@ playing / adventure game and nothing else " . 
 Critics had minor criticisms with the game 's quality when comparing to its contemporaries . Minson called its interface " old @-@ fashioned " , and Computer Gaming World said it was " clunky " and " marginal " , a description it also gave the game 's graphics . Graphically , Orr and Zzap ! 64 's Phil King found the game " primitive " , though " adequate " . More troubling to several reviewers was the game 's copy protection system . Ekholm was not pleased that he had to unfold a flimsy poster to identify the requested city . His copy was falling apart after several identifications . The game further frustrated him when it failed to acknowledge the correct key . The provided hints were incorrect , a situation also experienced by the Lessers . The inaccuracies were not restricted to the copy protection . Starkweather pointed out discrepancies in the documentation — several features of the game were either not explained or wrongly documented . 
 Ekholm dismissed Sword of Aragon for its flawed copy protection and perceived lack of strategy . <unk> was more condemning ; rating the game poorly for its graphics and sound , and confused by its presented lists of military and economic data , he called the game a " cheap clone " . Regardless , such issues did not deter other reviewers from praising the game . Pleased with the large amount of options to manage their cities and to order their armies in combat , they felt the game was deep and offered many exciting moments ; <unk> judged the system " challenging and ultimately rewarding . " According to Retro Gamer magazine , " Sword of Aragon is considered by many to be the best fantasy wargame ever . " Starkweather was equally pronounced in his opinion . He called Sword of Aragon addictive and was willing to overlook issues with the game , finding pleasure in formulating strategies and tactics to overcome the enemy .

" He earned All @-@ Pac @-@ 10 honors for the third straight season . Reflecting on his college career , Fuld said : " I think one of the things you take away from playing under Coach Marquess is whatever you do , be it baseball or anything else , you do it well and you do it with passion . You do it with excitement because , really , that 's the way to go about things . Not only in sports , but beyond sports . " 
 Fuld was drafted in the 24th round ( 703rd overall ) of the 2003 draft by the Chicago Cubs , but did not sign . Marquess thought that Fuld was drafted relatively late because of his size . At 5 ft 10 in , he is not as tall as most major league outfielders . But Fuld said of the Cubs ' bid : " It was a generous offer . It was a tough choice . " He then batted .361 with 14 RBIs and 10 stolen bases in the summer of 2003 for the Hyannis Mets in the Cape Cod League , and was voted a Cape Cod League All Star .

 When he became Stanford 's and the Pac @-@ 10 's all @-@ time leader in runs scored ( 268 ) , Fuld said : " It means a lot to break the record .

" When he graduated Stanford , in addition he ranked among the school 's all @-@ time top 10 in hits ( 353 ; # 2 ) , triples ( 16 ; # 3T ) , and doubles ( 58 ; # <unk> ) . 
 Fuld said : " I want to try my hand . It 's been a lifelong dream , really , to play professional baseball . I just love it too much not to give it a shot . " The Cubs drafted him for a second time , in the 10th round ( 306th overall ) of the 2004 draft , and this time Fuld signed , for a $ 25 @,@ 000 signing bonus . When he made it to the major leagues , he became the 78th former Stanford Cardinal to do so .

 The torn labrum injury he incurred in 2004 required surgery and a year of physiotherapy . During that time he read Michael Lewis 's book Moneyball and got an internship position with <unk> , Inc. of Chicago . " I was one of their reporters , which meant that I looked at game video and plotted the ' <unk> ' – type , velocity , and location – of every pitch " , Fuld said . " They have this grid where you click on exactly where the ball crosses the plate . Play the tape , pause , and repeat . " Fuld observed later : " The beauty of numbers is that our minds don 't necessarily capture the whole picture accurately . Our emotions remember certain things for whatever reason , and there are certain things you don 't remember .... that 's the beauty of numbers . It 's fact . There 's no way around it . " He also began seeking out stats that were not already kept . " There 's so many statistics out there that I thought ' There 's no stats on foul balls , ' so I picked a few players and started tracking them , thinking I 'd find something " , Fuld said . But his bag that contained the notebook with all his stats was stolen . 
 Fuld had an impressive minor league career that began in 2005 , when he hit .300 with a .377 OBP and 18 stolen bases in 443 at @-@ bats for the Single @-@ A Peoria Chiefs of the Midwest League . He also had a 17 @-@ game hit streak , and turned in 7 outfield assists from center field .

 In 2007 , Fuld batted .291 with a .371 on @-@ base percentage , in 282 at @-@ bats , as he began the season with the Tennessee Smokies in the Double @-@ A Southern League . " He knows how to play the game , when to take a pitch , when to work the count , and when to go ahead and swing away and juice the ball " , said his Tennessee manager , Listach . " He 's strong enough that he can hit the ball out of the yard occasionally . He 's a gap , line drive type hitter . He knows what type of hitter he is , and he doesn ’ t hit a lot of fly balls . " He was an efficient leadoff batter for Tennessee , with more walks ( 41 ) than strikeouts ( 38 ) . He was touted by Baseball America as having the best strike zone judgment in the organization . " He 's a very intelligent player " , added Listach . He continued : 
 He plays the game the right way . He plays the game hard . He plays the game smart . He steals a base when you need a base stolen , not necessarily when it 's 5 – 0 or a lopsided score . He does it when the team needs it . He makes the plays . He throws to the right bases . He 's a left @-@ handed hitter . He can run . He 's a prototypical leadoff hitter in the big leagues ..... His work ethic is off the charts . 
 Fuld was also touted by Listach as having the best outfield skills on the team , as he led the Southern League with 13 assists from the outfield .

 In 2008 , Fuld started the season with the Triple @-@ A Iowa Cubs . There , due to his fearless defense , he was referred to as " a crash test dummy with a death wish " , a " human wrecking ball act " , a " wall magnet " , and a " manager 's dream and a trainer 's worst nightmare . " 
 Fuld began the 2008 season at Triple @-@ A Iowa , but was demoted to the Double @-@ A Tennessee Smokies in May after struggling at the plate due to a right thumb injury . After hitting no higher than .245 in May , June , and July , he had a torrid August , batting .345 / .424 / .445 .

 In September 2007 , the Chicago Cubs called Fuld up to the major league team . He is one of 37 ballplayers from New Hampshire who have made it to the major leagues . He made his debut September 5 against the Los Angeles Dodgers , as a defensive replacement . " I have so much respect for players like ( Cubs first baseman ) Derrek Lee " , Fuld said . " They 're great players . But to meet them and actually play with them and contribute and help them win is kind of a surreal experience . It doesn 't seem too long ago that I was going to Fenway ( Park in Boston ) and idolizing these guys . I feel like a fan at times . I have to remind myself I 'm a player . " 
 That month he was " forced " to sing Stanford 's fight song on the team bus , as part of his rookie treatment . Later in the month , he was hazed after a game — made to walk from the park in Cincinnati to the team 's downtown hotel in a Batgirl getup , accompanied by Félix Pie in pink baby pajamas , Carmen <unk> ( as Supergirl ) , and Kevin Hart ( as Wonder Woman ) . After peeking at his outfit , before he had to don it , Fuld said : " I think it was Batgirl . I was actually looking forward to it , believe it or not . [ I didn 't try it on ] I 'm pretty sure I would 've looked good in it . Black 's my color . I never did the frat thing in college , so this would kind of be like that . " In mid @-@ September , as Manager Lou Piniella had still not given Fuld an at bat , someone on the team hung a " Moonlight Graham " sign in Fuld 's locker . 
 Against the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 22 , 2007 , playing right field as a defensive replacement , Fuld raced back and made a " spectacular " , " daredevil " , jarring catch just left of the 368 @-@ foot @-@ marker in right @-@ center field at Wrigley Field , slamming at full speed into the ivy @-@ covered brick wall , and robbing the Pirates ' <unk> Morgan of extra bases . In his next motion , Fuld then bounced off the bricks and wheeled , firing a one @-@ hop strike to double off a Pirates baserunner at first base ( see video of Fuld catch and throw to first ) . The home crowd of 47 @,@ 271 erupted , giving him a deafening standing ovation , and the Cubs who were on the field waited in front of his dugout to congratulate him . Thousands of fans chanted " Sam @-@ my ! Sam @-@ my ! " when he next came to bat . " That was amazing " , said Fuld . " They were going crazy . " General Manager Jim Hendry said : " That 's as good a play as I 've seen by a Cubs player at Wrigley Field since I 've been here . " The play later made ESPN on Baseball Tonight as the # 1 web gem of the day . After the season , Paul Sullivan of the Chicago Tribune cited it as the Cubs ' " Play of the Year . " Many Cub fans refer to it as : " The Catch . "

 In 2008 , Fuld pushed Pie for the center field spot during spring training . Piniella said that Pie was only " a head or nose in front " of Fuld , and commented : 
 [ Fuld ] ' s the type of kid who can catch your eye in one day . But the more you watch him , the more you look at his particular skills , he impresses you . He 's an athlete and has really good actions in the outfield , and then he plays a small man 's game with the bat , which is what he should do — hits the ball all over , puts it in play , keeps it on the ground . 
 Hendry observed : " [ Fuld ] can run . He 's a tremendous defensive player . " Hendry also indicated that Fuld was among the club 's untouchables , saying : " We 're not going to trade [ Fuld ] . It 's pretty simple . " In late March , however , Piniella chose Pie to open the season as the starting center fielder over Fuld , and sent Fuld down to the minor leagues . 
 = = = = = 2009 = = = = = 
 Fuld played for the Cubs in spring training in 2009 , but was sent down to their AAA team in late March to work on stealing bases . He was called back up on June 30 . Hendry said : " Sammy has been really hot . This will let Lou ( manager Piniella ) mix and match with outfield defense until Reed ( Johnson ) comes back . " 
 On July 1 , 2009 , Fuld recorded his first major league hit in his first major league start of the season , and second start of his career . Leading off the game Fuld hit a double against Virgil Vasquez of the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park . " It felt great to get the first one out of the way in the first inning " , Fuld said . " It kind of took the edge off the rest of the night . I felt comfortable all night long — I really couldn 't have asked for a better night . " In the fourth inning Fuld made a sliding catch of a sinking liner ( see video of Fuld 's sliding catch robbing Vazquez of a hit ) , and in the fifth inning he fielded a single and threw out Jack Wilson at home ( see video ) . " It was huge " , said Cubs starter Randy Wells . " Sam Fuld , man , he gets to so many balls . He made a [ heck ] of a play throwing that guy out — the perfect throw . " The following month , he crashed into the left field wall while making a sliding catch in a game against the Dodgers ( see video of Fuld making wall @-@ crashing catch ) . 
 Asked which player he would most like to switch positions with , <unk> Soto said : 
 " I would like to change with Sam Fuld for a play in the outfield . He 's running in the outfield , and all of a sudden he makes that catch , two inches before he hits the ground . Oh , my God , he lays out and then hits the ground — that 's amazing . I 'd like to know what it 's like to dive and catch the ball like that . " 
 Fuld hit the first home run of his major league career in the final game of the Cubs ' 2009 season , on October 4 at Wrigley Field . He finished the season batting .299 , and with the highest on @-@ base percentage ( .409 ) of any Cubs player with 100 or more plate appearances . 
 = = = = = 2010 = = = = = 
 Carrie Muskat , the Cubs ' MLB.com beat reporter , wrote on March 1 , 2010 , that : " I can see Fuld making the Cubs ' Opening Day roster ... Fuld has shown he can handle the part @-@ time workload , can play all three positions , and can be used as a defensive sub or pinch @-@ runner . " On March 30 , however , the Cubs sent him down to AAA Iowa . Piniella remarked : " The decisions weren 't easy . " He was called up to Chicago for the first time in the 2010 season on August 19 , and ended the season with only a handful of at bats . 
 Baseball writer Rob Neyer , noting that this followed Fuld batting .299 with a .409 on @-@ base percentage for the Cubs , wrote : 
 don 't you think you could find a place for a fast guy who gets on base and plays great defense ? The Cubs did find a place for him . No , not Wrigley Field . Not Heaven , either . Iowa . Again . Where Fuld posted a .383 on @-@ base percentage .... I 'm telling you , there are worse fourth outfielders on half the teams in the majors right now . 
 A writer for the American Spectator later mused : " what were the Cubs thinking ... ? ... perhaps decision makers ... didn 't ... pencil him into lineup cards because they were prejudiced against players of Fuld 's stature . But those who don 't believe guys of Fuld 's size can be solid major league players should be sentenced to sit in the corner under the dunce hat , and read Joe Morgan 's statistics over and over . "

 The Cubs had never given Fuld an extended chance . They instead limited his play to late @-@ season call @-@ ups over three years , including just 40 starts . After the 2010 season , they traded him to the Tampa Bay Rays , who had wanted him for a long time . He was traded with minor leaguers Hak @-@ Ju Lee , Brandon <unk> , Robinson Chirinos , and Chris Archer for starting pitcher Matt Garza , outfielder Fernando Perez , and Zac <unk> . 
 Manager Joe Maddon noted Fuld 's outstanding walks @-@ to @-@ strikeouts ratio , which Maddon referred to as " freaky @-@ weird " : 325 walks vs. 272 strikeouts in his professional career . Maddon said : " He 's a major @-@ league baseball player right now .... He 's been needing opportunity ; he 's probably going to get the opportunity here right now . " He also observed that Fuld is a : 
 very , very good defender . He has really great instincts out there , and a fine arm . He works excellent at @-@ bats .... If somebody were to get hurt , this guy could fill in on a regular basis for a while . He 's not going to be overwhelmed by anything . Great makeup .... He 's a pretty tough kid . 
 Rays hitting coach Derek Shelton observed that : " [ Fuld 's ] contact ratio is off the charts . He has probably one of the shortest swings I 've ever seen . " General manager Andrew Friedman said : " He 's a guy with a very interesting profile . He 's a plus defender in all three ( outfield ) spots , with superior contact skills , and a really good ability to discern balls and strikes ... and an ability to hit line drives with ... high frequency . " 
 Fuld made the team 's Opening Day roster , his first in the majors , as its fourth outfielder , and a late @-@ inning weapon off the bench , speedster pinch runner , and defensive replacement . Tommy <unk> of ESPN described him as : " Tampa Bay 's version of Brett Gardner ; albeit in a reduced role " . However , with Manny Ramirez sudden retirement , left fielder Johnny Damon became the team 's DH expanding Fuld 's role . On April 7 , he stole a career @-@ high 3 bases in one game , and Maddon began penciling him into the lineup as the team 's everyday leadoff hitter . 
 On April 9 , playing right field against the Chicago White Sox who had the bases loaded with two out in a very close game , Fuld made a spectacular catch . The Tampa Tribune called it " one of the best catches in team history " , and the St. Petersburg Times called it " Superman @-@ esque " . Fuld ran full speed from shallow right @-@ center after a ball hit into the right field corner by Juan Pierre , left the ground at the last instant in a full @-@ out , full @-@ extension dive , made a back @-@ handed catch with his body parallel to the ground , and then slid chest @-@ down across the warning track , bloodying his arms and legs ( see video ) . Rays center fielder B.J. Upton said : " Oh my god , oh my . I thought he was going to dive into the [ wall ] .... I was screaming from center field when he caught it . ' Great catch ! ' Should be play of the year so far . " Pitcher Wade Davis said : " I 've never seen a catch that good in person . " White Sox catcher A. J. Pierzynski observed : " that catch ... is one of the best catches I 've ever seen . Honestly , he ran like 50 yards to get to that ball . It was an incredible catch ... an amazing play . " ESPN 's Baseball Tonight program featured it as a web gem , it was # 1 on ESPN 's top plays of the weekend , SportsCenter named it as the best of its top @-@ 10 plays , and MLB Network named it a Play of the Week . His superhero status spread on the internet by late April , with the Toronto Sun writing : " Fuld ranks in the Top 10 in batting average , runs , and triples , and also leads the AL in stolen bases and YouTube hits , especially video hits for a catch in Chicago diving towards the right field corner onto the warning track that has been set to a Superman theme . " 
 Maddon noted : " His defense has been spectacular — tremendous defense . He 's ... a clinician out there . He pretty much does everything right . " Later in the month Maddon compared Fuld 's play favorably to that of Gold Glove left fielder Carl Crawford , saying that Fuld had a better arm , and compared his style of play to that of former perennial Gold Glove center fielder Jim Edmonds . 
 On April 11 , as a reporter for major league baseball described it , Fuld " turned Fenway Park into his personal playground . " Fuld missed hitting for the cycle only because he opted to stretch a single into a double . He had already hit a double , triple , and home run in a game against the Boston Red Sox when he came up in the 9th inning , in a runaway game which the Rays won 16 – 5 . Had he stopped at first base , he would have been just the second player in Tampa Bay Rays history to hit for the cycle , joining B.J. Upton . Maddon observed that Fuld 's refusal to stay at first " speaks to Sam 's integrity , right there . He plays with such zeal and intelligence , he 's just fun to watch ... I know a lot of guys who would have stopped . Some guys in the dugout said they would have slid into first base . " He became the fifth player in Tampa Bay history to have four extra @-@ base hits in a game , and the first since Tomás Pérez in 2006 . His four extra @-@ base hits and 11 total bases were also records for a Fenway Park debut . 
 His " Superman " YouTube video was joked about on Twitter with tweets at the # <unk> hash tag , such as " Sam Fuld was once intentionally walked while in the on deck circle " , " The Red Sox check under their bed for Sam Fuld " , and Maddon 's favorite : " Superman wears a Sam Fuld T @-@ shirt to bed . " Though not a Twitter user , Fuld caught on quickly : When reporters asked him the next day why he could not stop the rain that was causing a rainout , Fuld quipped : " This is me , washing my planet " . By mid @-@ April , he had won the starting left fielder position and leadoff hitter slot with the Rays . 
 On April 18 , a week after his 4 @-@ hit Fenway Park debut , Fuld had 4 hits in 4 at @-@ bats against the White Sox . That raised his batting average to an AL @-@ leading .396 , to go along with his league @-@ lead in stolen bases . His batting average was the second @-@ highest in team history through April 18 in a season , behind only Fred McGriff ( 1998 ) . He also became the first Tampa Bay player with two four @-@ hit games in a season while batting leadoff since Carl Crawford , who did it twice in 2005 , and the first major leaguer to have two four @-@ hit games in the 2011 season . He was fourth in the league in hits ( 21 ) , fifth in on @-@ base percentage ( .431 ) and OPS ( 1 @.@ 035 ) , tied for fifth in doubles ( 6 ) , sixth in slugging percentage ( <unk> ) , and was third @-@ toughest player to strike out ( one strikeout per 14 @.@ 5 plate appearances ) . As of April 25 , he was leading the AL with 10 stolen bases . A reporter for major league baseball , in explaining his rise to fame , wrote : " you won 't find any other 5 @-@ foot @-@ 9 ... New Hampshire @-@ born , Jewish , diabetic outfielders in the Baseball Encyclopedia . His agent Jim Munsey , observing that given what Fuld has overcome and how he plays the game : " He 's hard not to like " , suddenly received a number of calls asking for Fuld for marketing opportunities . 
 He made another diving , face @-@ planting catch of a sinking line drive , leading Rays pitcher David Price to say : " I heard that the world is covered by 75 percent water , and the other 25 percent is covered by Sam Fuld . " As of April 20 , Fuld led Baseball Tonight 's Web Gem standings with 18 points , which included Web Gems at each outfield position . A writer for The American Spectator observed : " he owns the 11 o @-@ clock highlight reel . ( My sources inform me that ESPN executives are considering changing the name of " Baseball Tonight " to " The Sam Fuld Show . " ) " In late April , he was placed on the American League ballot for the 2011 All Star Game . 
 The press and the Rays began to refer to him by the nicknames " Superman " , " Super Sam " , and " The Legendary Sam Fuld " . The Rays gave away Super Sam Fuld Superhero Capes to children at the team 's May 29 game . The cape showed a diving Super Sam Fuld in mid @-@ flight , behind a shield bearing his nickname . 
 In a game against the Brewers on June 20 , 2011 , he reported to the pitcher 's mound in the 8th inning and warmed up in order to give a relief pitcher time to warm up in the bull pen . He did not throw a recorded pitch , or appear as a pitcher in the box score . 
 Fuld finished the season with a .240 batting average , and tied for second on the team in stolen bases , with 20 .

 On September 2 , 2013 , against the Los Angeles Angels , Fuld pitched a third of an inning , not giving up any runs , and got J. B. <unk> to fly out to end a threat in the eighth inning . He pitched at speeds topping out at 88 MPH . He was the third position player to pitch in Rays history , joining Wade Boggs in 1999 and Josh Wilson in 2007 . 
 On September 30 , during the 163rd game of the season and tiebreaker to determine the last American League wildcard playoff spot against the Texas Rangers , Fuld scored the fifth run of the game , stealing third base and coming home on an error by Rangers pitcher Tanner Scheppers . 
 For the season , he played in 70 games as a substitute , which were the most by any AL player since Brian Anderson played in 70 with the White Sox in 2008 , and was one of six AL outfielders to start at least 10 games at all three outfield positions . 
 After the season , Fuld was non @-@ tendered by the Rays , making him a free agent . He was among the most popular players in recent Rays history .

 Fuld signed a minor league deal with the Oakland Athletics on January 4 , 2014 .

He stole third six times , tying for seventh in the AL . His five assists from center field , where he started 58 games , tied him for fifth among AL center fielders . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Fuld is Jewish , his father is Jewish and his mother is Catholic , and has said that he was " kind of raised celebrating both " religions ' holidays . 
 He was ten pounds at birth , so big he was nicknamed " Sumo Sam " . He is the son of Kenneth Fuld , Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Professor of Psychology at the University of New Hampshire , and Amanda Merrill , a New Hampshire State Senator . He is also a second cousin , once removed , of former Lehman Brothers CEO Dick Fuld . 
 He got his start playing baseball hitting plastic wiffle balls pitched by his grandmother when he was three years old . As a young child , he carried around a copy of the The Complete Baseball Handbook instead of a security blanket . " He was only 5 or 6 and he was already computing batting averages and ERAs " , his father said . " He 'd sit in the bathtub , and I 'd say ' If a guy goes 17 @-@ for @-@ 37 , what 's his batting average ? ' What struck me is that he 'd perform these operations in very creative ways – not just that he got the right answer , but his methodology , adding in a factor and then dividing by 10 , etc . I 'd watch him and say ' wow , ' just like I said ' wow ' when he used to hit . " 
 Fuld admits his height is 5 ' 8 " to 5 ' 9 " , but " claims the right to round up " . Shorter than most major leaguers , he chokes up three inches on the bat , and says : " When I realized I was going to be limited physically , I looked for guys in the big leagues who were little . I 'd buy baseball cards and find anyone under 5 – 10 who played in the outfield , and say , ' That 's my guy ; there 's hope . ' " While he is listed at 180 pounds , a reporter observed : " if Fuld weighs 180 , it would have to be carrying all of his bats , plus the baseball donut . Despite his size , Fuld was playing in a 16 and under league by the time he was 12 years old . 
 In June 2009 , Fuld married Sarah ( Kolodner ) . The two met in high school . He had met her while they were fellow students at Phillips Exeter Academy . She is an athlete as well and , like Sam , she was voted the Outstanding Female Athlete of her graduating class at Exeter , having played varsity soccer , ice hockey and lacrosse during her four years there . She was recruited by Princeton University for their lacrosse team , became the starting goalie as a freshman and won two national lacrosse championships , was twice # 1 Goalie in NCAA Div . 1 Goals Against Average , runner up a third time , is # 4 in Career GAA and holds the all time winning record for a Princeton University lacrosse goalie ( men 's or women 's programs ) . They have four children , Charles , Jane , William and Spencer . 
 = = Diabetes = = 
 Fuld was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when he was 10 years old . He recalled , " I was losing weight , I was thirsty all the time , just classic symptoms , so my parents knew something was wrong and the doctor diagnosed it right away . It was tough , but when I realized there was no other alternative , I just looked at it as a challenge . " 
 At the age of 12 , he met pitcher Bill <unk> , who also had diabetes , and talked to him for 10 minutes . " That was enough to inspire me " , Fuld said . " Any time I can talk to young diabetic kids , I look forward to that opportunity " , said <unk> . 
 Former Cub All Star third baseman and Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Ron Santo was also afflicted with Type 1 diabetes . Santo hid his ailment from others during his playing days , because he was afraid they would consider him weak . Santo later had both his legs amputated , because of complications caused by his diabetes . 
 Now , at least six times a day Fuld opens a small black case , withdraws a <unk> , pricks a finger ( " It 's pretty painless ; I 've got <unk> fingers " ) , and checks his blood sugar ( a 30 @-@ second process ) . He does it whenever he feels he should check his blood sugar level , even if he is in the clubhouse or the dugout during a game . He gives himself shots of insulin in his stomach every time he eats , which can be as many as five times a day . 
 Fuld is also comfortable handling the kidding in the clubhouse regarding his treatments . " We dish it out pretty good about his insulin shots " , said his AA manager Pat Listach . " We always give him stuff about putting needles in the refrigerator , and shooting up in the clubhouse . He takes it all in stride . He 's a good guy . " 
 Asked whether he thinks about his blood sugar level when he is chasing fly balls , he answered : " For those brief moments , it 's out of my mind . I get back to the dugout , and it definitely crosses my mind . ' OK , my face is intact – what about my sugar ? ' "

 = Prototype filter = 
 Prototype filters are electronic filter designs that are used as a template to produce a modified filter design for a particular application . They are an example of a <unk> design from which the desired filter can be scaled or transformed . They are most often seen in regard to electronic filters and especially linear analogue passive filters . However , in principle , the method can be applied to any kind of linear filter or signal processing , including mechanical , acoustic and optical filters . 
 Filters are required to operate at many different frequencies , impedances and bandwidths . The utility of a prototype filter comes from the property that all these other filters can be derived from it by applying a scaling factor to the components of the prototype . The filter design need thus only be carried out once in full , with other filters being obtained by simply applying a scaling factor . 
 Especially useful is the ability to transform from one bandform to another . In this case , the transform is more than a simple scale factor . <unk> here is meant to indicate the category of passband that the filter possesses . The usual <unk> are lowpass , highpass , bandpass and bandstop , but others are possible . In particular , it is possible for a filter to have multiple passbands . In fact , in some treatments , the bandstop filter is considered to be a type of multiple passband filter having two passbands . Most commonly , the prototype filter is expressed as a lowpass filter , but other techniques are possible . 
 Parts of this article or section rely on the reader 's knowledge of the complex impedance representation of capacitors and inductors and on knowledge of the frequency domain representation of signals . 
 = = Low @-@ pass prototype = = 
 The prototype is most often a low @-@ pass filter with a 3 dB corner frequency of angular frequency <unk> 
 = 1 rad / s . Occasionally , frequency f ' ' = 
 1 Hz is used instead of <unk> 
 = 1 . Likewise , the nominal or characteristic impedance of the filter is set to R ' = 
 1 Ω . 
 In principle , any non @-@ zero frequency point on the filter response could be used as a reference for the prototype design . For example , for filters with ripple in the passband , the corner frequency is usually defined as the highest frequency at maximum ripple rather than 3 dB . Another case is in image parameter filters ( an older design method than the more modern network synthesis filters ) which use the cut @-@ off frequency rather than the 3 dB point since cut @-@ off is a well @-@ defined point in this type of filter . 
 The prototype filter can only be used to produce other filters of the same class and order . For instance , a fifth @-@ order Bessel filter prototype can be converted into any other fifth @-@ order Bessel filter , but it cannot be transformed into a third @-@ order Bessel filter or a fifth @-@ order Tchebyscheff filter . 
 = = Frequency scaling = = 
 The prototype filter is scaled to the frequency required with the following transformation : 
 <formula> 
 where ωc ' is the value of the frequency parameter ( e.g. cut @-@ off frequency ) for the prototype and ωc is the desired value . So if ωc ' = 1 then the transfer function of the filter is transformed as : 
 <formula> 
 It can readily be seen that to achieve this , the non @-@ resistive components of the filter must be transformed by : 
 <formula> and , <formula> 
 = = Impedance scaling = = 
 Impedance scaling is invariably a scaling to a fixed resistance . This is because the terminations of the filter , at least nominally , are taken to be a fixed resistance . To carry out this scaling to a nominal impedance R , each impedance element of the filter is transformed by : 
 <formula> 
 It may be more convenient on some elements to scale the admittance instead : 
 <formula> 
 It can readily be seen that to achieve this , the non @-@ resistive components of the filter must be scaled as : 
 <formula> and , <formula> 
 Impedance scaling by itself has no effect on the transfer function of the filter ( providing that the terminating impedances have the same scaling applied to them ) . However , it is usual to combine the frequency and impedance scaling into a single step : 
 <formula> and , <formula> 
 = = <unk> transformation = = 
 In general , the bandform of a filter is transformed by replacing iω where it occurs in the transfer function with a function of iω . This in turn leads to the transformation of the impedance components of the filter into some other component ( s ) . The frequency scaling above is a trivial case of bandform transformation corresponding to a lowpass to lowpass transformation . 
 = = = Lowpass to highpass = = = 
 The frequency transformation required in this case is : 
 <formula> 
 where ωc is the point on the highpass filter corresponding to ωc ' on the prototype . The transfer function then transforms as : 
 <formula> 
 Inductors are transformed into capacitors according to , 
 <formula> 
 and capacitors are transformed into inductors , 
 <formula> 
 the primed quantities being the component value in the prototype . 
 = = = Lowpass to bandpass = = = 
 In this case , the required frequency transformation is : 
 <formula> 
 where Q is the Q @-@ factor and is equal to the inverse of the fractional bandwidth : 
 <formula> 
 If ω1 and ω2 are the lower and upper frequency points ( respectively ) of the bandpass response corresponding to ωc ' of the prototype , then , 
 <formula> and <formula> 
 <unk> is the absolute bandwidth , and ω0 is the resonant frequency of the resonators in the filter . Note that frequency scaling the prototype prior to lowpass to bandpass transformation does not affect the resonant frequency , but instead affects the final bandwidth of the filter . 
 The transfer function of the filter is transformed according to : 
 <formula> 
 Inductors are transformed into series resonators , 
 <formula> 
 and capacitors are transformed into parallel resonators , 
 <formula> 
 = = = Lowpass to bandstop = = = 
 The required frequency transformation for lowpass to bandstop is : 
 <formula> 
 Inductors are transformed into parallel resonators , 
 <formula> 
 and capacitors are transformed into series resonators , 
 <formula> 
 = = = Lowpass to multi @-@ band = = = 
 Filters with multiple passbands may be obtained by applying the general transformation : 
 <formula> 
 The number of resonators in the expression corresponds to the number of passbands required . Lowpass and highpass filters can be viewed as special cases of the resonator expression with one or the other of the terms becoming zero as appropriate . <unk> filters can be regarded as a combination of a lowpass and a highpass filter . Multiple bandstop filters can always be expressed in terms of a multiple bandpass filter . In this way it , can be seen that this transformation represents the general case for any bandform , and all the other transformations are to be viewed as special cases of it . 
 The same response can equivalently be obtained , sometimes with a more convenient component topology , by transforming to multiple stopbands instead of multiple passbands . The required transformation in those cases is : 
 <formula> 
 = = Alternative prototype = = 
 In his treatment of image filters , Zobel provided an alternative basis for constructing a prototype which is not based in the frequency domain . The Zobel prototypes do not , therefore , correspond to any particular bandform , but they can be transformed into any of them . Not giving special significance to any one bandform makes the method more mathematically pleasing ; however , it is not in common use . 
 The Zobel prototype considers filter sections , rather than components . That is , the transformation is carried out on a two @-@ port network rather than a two @-@ terminal inductor or capacitor . The transfer function is expressed in terms of the product of the series impedance , Z , and the shunt admittance Y of a filter half @-@ section . See the article Image impedance for a description of half @-@ sections . This quantity is <unk> , adding to the prototype 's generality . Generally , <unk> is a complex quantity , 
 <formula> and as U and V are both , in general , functions of ω we should properly write , 
 <formula> 
 With image filters , it is possible to obtain filters of different classes from the constant k filter prototype by means of a different kind of transformation ( see composite image filter ) , constant k being those filters for which Z / Y is a constant . For this reason , filters of all classes are given in terms of U ( ω ) for a constant k , which is notated as , 
 <formula> 
 In the case of <unk> networks , i.e. no resistors , the quantity V ( ω ) is zero and only U ( ω ) need be considered . Uk ( ω ) ranges from 0 at the centre of the passband to -1 at the cut @-@ off frequency and then continues to increase negatively into the stopband regardless of the bandform of the filter being designed . To obtain the required bandform , the following transforms are used : 
 For a lowpass constant k prototype that is scaled : 
 <formula> 
 the independent variable of the response plot is , 
 <formula>

 = University of Virginia Greek life = 
 University of Virginia Greek life encompasses the collegiate Greek organizations on the grounds of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville , Virginia . Greek life at the university began in the 1850s with the establishment of a number of fraternities , and the system has since expanded to include sororities , professional organizations , service fraternities , honor fraternities , and cultural organizations . The Greek system has been significant to the history of the University of Virginia , and the history of the university 's Greek system includes the founding of Kappa Sigma and Pi Kappa Alpha , two national fraternities . 
 Roughly 30 % of the student body belongs to a social fraternity or sorority , with additional students involved in professional , service , and honor fraternities . Many of the university 's fraternities and sororities are residential , meaning they own or rent a house for their members to use ; many of these houses are located on Rugby Road and the surrounding streets , just north of the university . Additionally , three social fraternities hold reserved rooms on the Lawn and the Range : Kappa Sigma in Room 46 East Lawn , Trigon Engineering Society in Room 17 West Lawn , and Pi Kappa Alpha in Room 47 West Range . Reflecting UVA 's tradition of student self @-@ governance , the system is currently governed by four Greek Councils consisting of student leaders ; however , it is also overseen by the Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life in the university 's Office of the Dean of Students . 
 = = History = = 
 Greek life at UVA began a few decades after the school 's establishment in 1819 . Before this time social life at the university was fixed around debating societies ; the now @-@ defunct Patrick Henry Society , for instance , initially had a membership nearly equal to the size of the student body . In the 1850s the first fraternities began to appear and assumed a significant role in the student body 's social landscape . In the following decades , the university became the birthplace of two national fraternities and saw many more fraternity chapters chartered . The twentieth century saw the system expand even more to include professional fraternities , social sororities , local fraternities , and black fraternities and sororities . Moving into the 2000s , several new social Greek organizations were founded , and multicultural organizations began to rise to prominence . 
 = = = 1800s : Debating societies , secret societies , and the creation of fraternities = = = 
 For several decades following the founding of the university , the major student societies on grounds were the debating societies . Several of these societies , notably the Jefferson Literary and Debating Society and the Washington Literary Society and Debating Union , are still active today . These and other debating societies that are no longer in existence , such as the Philomathean Society and the Parthenon Society , served as the primary means of student societal activity in the early days of the University . 
 In the decade before the Civil War , eleven fraternities established chapters at the university . The first was Delta Kappa Epsilon , or <unk> , which was founded in 1852 as a " secret " colony and remains active to this day . Faculty were originally against the creation of fraternities due to years of riotous behavior among the students and attacks upon faculty . According to University historian Philip Alexander Bruce , the faculty feared the " orderly spirit of the student body acting as a whole or in segments , whether organized into secret fraternities or into <unk> bands . " Despite these objections , however , a chapter of <unk> was founded , and other Greek fraternities followed . It can be said generally about the early UVA fraternities that the only " secret " aspect of them was their operation and meeting location ; the membership was not kept secret . As is the case with most modern fraternities , the original fraternities on grounds were meant to provide social engagement and promote close ties between members . 
 Fraternity growth was interrupted by the Civil War , as men from many Southern colleges halted their studies to join the Confederate army . Many fraternity chapters ceased to exist during this time , but some students made efforts to preserve their fraternities as the war continued . Harry St. John Dixon , a member of Sigma Chi from the University of Virginia , joined with four other Sigma Chi brothers from other universities to form the Constantine Chapter of the fraternity . Created in 1864 , this chapter was meant to preserve the bonds of the fraternity during the war , promote ties between the North and South , and ensure the fraternity 's continued existence . 
 The expansion of fraternity life resumed after the war ; by 1892 there were eighteen fraternities on grounds . Fraternities began to share the social spotlight with ribbon societies at the university , which were founded in reaction to the fraternities ' social exclusivity . The ribbon societies , such as Eli Banana and <unk> , were originally meant to increase social involvement among students , but eventually took on a political role in the university as well . They became particularly prestigious , mainly pulling their membership from fraternities , and election to their societies was considered a high honor . Despite this social competition , fraternities continued to grow at the university . 
 = = = 1868 : Founding of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity = = = 
 Pi Kappa Alpha was founded on Sunday evening March 1 , 1868 , at 47 West Range at the University of Virginia , by Robertson Howard , Julian Edward Wood , James Benjamin Sclater Jr . , Frederick Southgate Taylor , Littleton Waller Tazewell Bradford and William Alexander . On March 1 , 1869 , exactly one year after the Alpha Chapter at the University of Virginia was formed , the Beta Chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha was founded at Davidson College . Expanding the fraternity proved difficult because the Civil War disorganized many Southern colleges , and many colleges banned the formation of secret societies . After almost a decade of decline , Pi Kappa Alpha was " re @-@ founded " as part of the Hampden @-@ Sydney Convention , held in a dorm room at Hampden – Sydney College . Pi Kappa Alpha was not originally organized as a sectional fraternity ; however , by constitutional provision it became so in 1889 . It remained a Southern fraternity until the New Orleans Convention in 1909 when Pi Kappa Alpha officially declared itself a national organization . Originally , Pi Kappa Alpha 's membership was restricted to white men , but the race restriction was removed in 1964 . 
 = = = 1869 : Founding of Kappa Sigma fraternity = = = 
 On December 10 , 1869 , five students at the University of Virginia met in 46 East Lawn and founded the Kappa Sigma Fraternity . William Grigsby McCormick , George Miles Arnold , John Covert Boyd , Edmund Law Rogers , Jr . , and Frank Courtney Nicodemus established the fraternity based on the traditions of the <unk> Sepher , an ancient order at the University of Bologna in the Middle Ages . These five founders became collectively known as the " Five Friends and Brothers . " In 1872 , Kappa Sigma initiated Stephen Alonzo Jackson , who would go on to transform the struggling local fraternity into a strong international Brotherhood . In 1873 , thanks to Jackson 's work , Kappa Sigma expanded to Trinity College ( now Duke University ) , the University of Maryland , and Washington and Lee University . Since then , Kappa Sigma has become a large international fraternity with over 300 active chapters and colonies in North America . 
 = = = Early 1900s : Residences , professional fraternities , and the first women 's fraternities = = = 
 In the beginning of the twentieth century the fraternity system continued to expand at such a rapid pace that university newspapers questioned if the increase in the number of fraternities would ever end . Many fraternity chapters were founded during this time that no longer exist at the university , such Alpha Chi Rho , Theta Nu Epsilon , and Delta Chi . Other chapters that are still active were founded at this time as well , such as Theta Chi and Phi Sigma Kappa . 
 Also during this time fraternities began to purchase and construct houses . During the late 1800s fraternities did not have dedicated houses ; instead , they inhabited residential areas scattered around grounds , such as Dawson 's Row near the Lawn and boarding houses north of the university . In 1908 , the university 's Board of Visitors first offered a land lease and a $ 12 @,@ 000 loan to Kappa Sigma to construct a fraternity house , and many other fraternities followed . Most of these were located just north of the Rotunda , on Rugby Road , Madison Lane , University Place , and the surrounding streets . Some of these houses cost up to $ 20 @,@ 000 to build , and many drew inspiration from historic UVA buildings or residences of the Old South , using elements of Jeffersonian architecture . Two houses were even styled to closely resemble famous buildings in the area , with Zeta Psi 's house modeled after Monticello and Farmington , and Phi Kappa Psi 's house modeled after Carr 's Hill . By 1916 most fraternities had built , purchased , or rented a house for their members . 
 Around the turn of the century , scholastic Greek organizations appeared on grounds . The university chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was founded in 1908 , promoting scholarship in all fields of study . Different schools had specific honor and professional societies as well : Phi Delta Phi for the law department , Phi Rho Sigma for medicine , Kappa Delta Mu for chemistry , and many others . A chapter of Theta Tau , an engineering society , was founded in 1923 , and Trigon Engineering Society was founded in 1924 as a local fraternity for engineering students . Trigon and Theta Tau dominated student government in the Engineering School during this time , often fielding competing candidates for student office . Likewise in the College , the University Party and the Cavalier Party were dominated by Lambda Pi and Skull & Keys , two Greek organizations . 
 It was during the first half of the twentieth century that the first women 's fraternities were established . The university first admitted women to graduate programs in 1920 , although undergraduate women were not allowed at the university until much later . With these graduate women came several female Greek organizations , referred to alternately as sororities or women 's fraternities . The first sorority to establish a chapter at the university was Chi Omega , whose chapter was founded in 1927 . A Kappa Delta chapter followed in 1932 , and a chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha was established twenty years later in 1952 . 
 In 1947 , with the inauguration of Colgate Darden as president of the university , first @-@ year students were prohibited from joining fraternities and sororities . This restriction was later eased to a one @-@ semester prohibition , which is still in place today . During this time only 20 percent of students were members of the 24 fraternities on grounds . Darden was critical of the fraternities ' behavior , arguing in a 1949 report to the Board of Visitors that the groups had failed to uphold the interests of the university community and to provide the leadership expected of them . Additionally , university leaders condemned the fraternities ' treatment of their houses , which were extremely run down . Members would often solicit tens of thousands of dollars of donations from alumni to refurbish houses , only to see the improvements disappear within a few years . Despite the administrators ' concerns , this problem was not addressed until 1983 , when the university created the Historic Renovation Corporation , or HRC . The HRC , which later became a subsidiary of the UVA Foundation , renovates and manages the properties of a number of fraternity and sorority houses . 
 = = = Late 1900s : Easters , African @-@ American fraternities , and sororities = = = 
 The 1970s saw great upheaval in the Greek system and the university as a whole . Fraternities , whose membership was waning earlier , began to increase in size . In 1973 nearly 45 percent of first @-@ years joined fraternities , the highest percentage in school history , and with this increased membership came more rowdy behavior . In the 1970s the annual Easters parties , which had originated in the 1800s as formal dances sponsored by the ribbon societies , began to be particularly wild . The annual affair had evolved into a weekend @-@ long celebration ; the fraternities would flood Mad Bowl and the surrounding areas , creating huge mud pits for the event . By 1976 , it was estimated that 15 @,@ 000 people had come from up and down the East Coast to pack Mad Bowl . Students washing mud off of themselves led to clogged drainage systems in the university , and entire dorms were flooded . Eventually the tradition became so belligerent and unmanageable that , in 1982 , the university terminated Easters . 
 African Americans were originally admitted to the university in the mid @-@ 1950s , but few attended until the 1970s ; fraternities at this time were generally racially and religiously segregated . Although a student fraternity committee emphasized the fraternities ' rejection of racial discrimination , in 1969 only 5 of 578 fraternity pledges were black . African @-@ American fraternities and sororities soon established chapters at the university , although they presented themselves as service organizations rather than traditional social organizations . In the mid @-@ 1970s , although some black students were invited to join the heavily white fraternities , many preferred to join their own organizations . By the fall of 1973 , four black fraternities and one black sorority had established chapters on grounds . 
 In 1970 the College of Arts and Sciences allowed the first women to enroll in its undergraduate programs , which effectively made the university coeducational . This led to the rapid establishment of many social sororities at the university , and by the end of 1970s there were eleven sorority chapters at the university , with still more chartered in the 1980s . 
 In 1975 the sororities established the Inter @-@ Sorority Council , or ISC , to govern the increasing number of sororities on grounds . The ISC was founded to continue the tradition of student self @-@ governance , and was similar to the university 's Inter @-@ Fraternity Council ( IFC ) in its function . The organization was named the Inter @-@ Sorority Council to mimic the name of the Inter @-@ Fraternity Council , which fraternities had established in 1934 ; this was meant to emphasize sorority women 's equality with fraternity men . Later , in 2005 , the ISC voted to formally associate with the National Panhellenic Conference , the national governing body of social sororities . Despite this change , the ISC at the university retained its name due to its historical heritage . 
 = = = 2000 onward : The rise of multicultural fraternities = = = 
 The first decade of the 2000s saw a quick rise in the number of multicultural organizations at UVA . In 1999 , the first Latina and Asian @-@ interest sorority chapters were founded at UVA , Omega Phi Beta and alpha Kappa Delta Phi , respectively . The university 's first Latino fraternity , a chapter of Lambda Upsilon Lambda , was founded later that same year . These three organizations founded the Fraternity @-@ Sorority Council , which was meant to organize the newly created multicultural organizations ; in 2000 , this group was renamed the Multicultural Greek Council , or MGC , and the council exists to this day . With the creation of additional cultural fraternities and sororities , the MGC has grown to a total of eight organizations . 
 In 2002 the IFC decided to admit local fraternities , fraternities that are not affiliated with a national organization , for the first time ( although local fraternities had existed at UVA prior to this time , they had not been permitted to join the IFC ) . Two years prior , when the Phi Delta Theta national organization decided to ban alcohol consumption in its chapter houses , the UVA chapter broke away from its national organization and created local organization Phi Delta Alpha , which was later renamed Phi Society . After debate within the IFC , Phi Society was admitted and recognized by the University as a local fraternity . Phi Society is viewed as the continuation of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity that existed prior to 2000 and maintains the same house . In 2001 , Phi Delta Theta established another chapter at the university that adheres to its directives concerning alcohol consumption . The Greek system 's expansion to new groups continued in 2015 , as local fraternity Sigma Omicron Rho became the first gender @-@ inclusive and LGBTQ fraternity to be recognized by the university . 
 = = Governance of Greek organizations = = 
 = = = University recognition = = = 
 University policy prevents national fraternities and sororities from directly establishing a chapter at the university ; instead , an interested group of students must establish an interest group , petition for establishment , and obtain sponsorship from one of the Greek councils . Once sponsorship is obtained , a group enters the provisional phase of the process ; at this point the interest group may contact a national fraternity or sorority to begin the process of establishing themselves as a colony or chapter . Upon successful completion of the provisional phase , the organization is granted full membership in its chosen Greek council . 
 In order to maintain a formal relationship with the university , each Greek organization must annually complete a Fraternal Organization Agreement ( FOA ) . The university does not " recognize " Greek organizations ; it permits fraternal organizations to exist without signing an FOA . However , signing an FOA grants additional benefits to organizations , including the ability to use certain university spaces and to join a Greek council . 
 = = = Greek councils = = = 
 There are several councils at UVA that oversee the functions of their member organizations . While most Greek organizations are members of a Greek council , there are several organizations that are independent of these councils , mainly coeducational organizations , professional fraternities , and honor societies . Traditionally , a student is not allowed to join more than one social fraternity or sorority ; however , students are normally allowed to join independent fraternities or sororities ( mainly professional or honor organizations ) in addition to a social fraternity or sorority . The four Greek councils at the University of Virginia are as follows : 
 The Inter @-@ Fraternity Council , or IFC , is the oldest of the Greek councils . Founded in 1934 , the IFC oversees 32 social fraternities and is led by a governing board that is elected by the brothers of the member fraternities . The IFC works with the Presidents ' Council , which consists of fraternity chapter presidents , to govern the fraternity community . 
 The Inter @-@ Sorority Council , or ISC , is the governing body of the majority of UVA 's social sororities . The ISC was founded in 1975 , is entirely student @-@ run , and consists of 16 member sororities . 
 The National Pan @-@ Hellenic Council , or NPHC , was formed to unite the traditionally black organizations on grounds . The NPHC was originally known as the Black Fraternal Council , which was established in 1973 by the charter of Omega Psi Phi fraternity . In 2005 , the BFC was renamed the National Pan @-@ Hellenic Council . These member organizations include 7 total all @-@ male fraternities and all @-@ female sororities . UVA 's NPHC is not to be confused with the National Panhellenic Conference , which is the national governing body of social sororities . 
 The Multicultural Greek Council , or MGC , is the youngest of the Greek councils and comprises the multicultural Greek organizations on grounds . Founded in 1999 , the MGC is composed of 9 total single @-@ sex and coeducational organizations . Each of these organizations emphasizes a particular race or culture , particularly Asian or Latino culture ; however , while these organizations may have a certain cultural emphasis , membership is generally open to students of any race .

 = = = Rolling Stone article = = = 
 In 2014 the University of Virginia fraternity and sorority system became the focus of significant national scrutiny due to the publication of an article in the December 2014 issue of Rolling Stone magazine , entitled " A Rape on Campus " and authored by Sabrina Erdely . The article alleged that in September 2012 , a group of male fraternity members at the university had attacked and raped a female student as part of an initiation rite at a party at the university 's chapter of Phi Kappa Psi . The article further asserted that the university 's sexual assault policies were severely lacking and that the university administration did not handle sexual assault cases appropriately . The article attracted significant media attention and made national headlines , leading to the suspension of the university 's Greek system and further investigation into the article 's claims ; these investigations quickly revealed numerous inconsistencies and raised serious questions about the article 's veracity . On January 12 , 2015 , Charlottesville Police Department officials told the University that " their investigation has not revealed any substantive basis to confirm that the allegations raised in the Rolling Stone article occurred at Phi Kappa Psi ... so there 's no reason to keep them suspended " . On January 30 , 2015 , UVA President Teresa Sullivan acknowledged that the Rolling Stone story was discredited . Charlottesville Police officially suspended their four @-@ month investigation on March 23 , 2015 , stating that they had no evidence of a gang rape taking place , and that " there is no substantive basis to support the account alleged in the Rolling Stone article . " On April 5 , 2015 , Columbia Journalism Review published a report calling the Rolling Stone article " a failure " and criticizing the magazine 's actions . That same day , Rolling Stone officially retracted the article and has since issued multiple apologies for the story .

 " Already Gone " is a song performed by American pop singer @-@ songwriter Kelly Clarkson from her fourth studio album , All I Ever Wanted . It is co @-@ written by Clarkson and Ryan Tedder , who also produced it . The song was released as the album 's third single in August 2009 . Lyrically , " Already Gone " is about the breakup of a relationship ; the music consists of an arrangement using a piano , drums , and string instruments . 
 The production and release of " Already Gone " have been surrounded in controversy . Clarkson claimed that Tedder re @-@ used the musical arrangement on the 2008 Beyoncé Knowles song " Halo " , and stated that the public would incorrectly assume that she had stolen it ; Tedder declared the accusations hurtful and false . After failing to prevent the song from being included on All I Ever Wanted because the track listing had already been finalized and the album was already being pressed , Clarkson then voiced her anger towards her record company bosses for subsequently deciding to release it as a single . The accompanying music video was directed by Joseph Kahn , who complained that he was not allowed to fully realize his vision , and stated he was unhappy with the final result . It features scenes of Clarkson dressed in a gold gown and expensive jewelry while lying on a chaise longue in an apartment . Shots of floating objects intersperse a second scene in which Clarkson , wearing a black dress , sings in a rehearsal room while surrounded by the instruments of an invisible orchestra . 
 Despite her dissatisfaction with the song 's release as a single , Clarkson began promoting it in July 2009 , performing it live on the Late Show with David Letterman and other talk shows . In the fall , she performed the song on VH1 Divas and at the American Music Awards . She included " Already Gone " in the encore set of her 2009 All I Ever Wanted Tour . Clarkson has also performed the song in tours after . The song has received much praise from music critics , and is regarded as one of the highlights of All I Ever Wanted . Critics have praised the song for its expressions of vulnerability , its emotional impact , and its successful use of the ballad form . It peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 , and was certified Platinum in Canada and Gold in Australia . 
 = = Writing and composition = = 
 " Already Gone " was co @-@ written by Clarkson and OneRepublic lead singer Ryan Tedder . Tedder describes it as " an emotional , heartbreaking breakup song . " Tedder and Clarkson wrote six songs together for inclusion on Clarkson 's fourth studio album All I Ever Wanted , and " Already Gone " is one of three of those that appear on the track list . 
 " Already Gone " is a ballad . The music is described by Sarah Liss of CBC News as having " a pounding heartbeat , twinkly piano and swooping strings " , and by James Montgomery of MTV as having " somber piano , crashing drums and hand @-@ claps " . Eric R. Danton from The Hartford Courant explains that the piano and string arrangements " roll mournfully " over the percussion . The sheet music indicates that the song is set in common time and has a moderately slow tempo with a metronome of 74 beats per minute . It is written in the key of A major arranged in the chord progression of A – Esus4 – E – F ♯ m – D – A – Esus4 @-@ E – F ♯ m – D – Bm – D in the verses , and A – Esus4 – E – F ♯ m – E – D – E in the chorus . The vocal range spans from B3 to E5 . 
 The song 's narrative is in first person , and depicts Clarkson telling her lover that although he has done nothing wrong in their relationship , it was never meant to be and is destined for failure . She tells her partner that he " couldn 't have loved [ her ] better " , but to avoid hurting him in the future , he should move on , as she " is already gone " . Clarkson sings with what Danton describes as " layered vocals " . 
 = = Beyoncé similarities and Ryan Tedder feud = = 
 Before teaming with Clarkson to write " Already Gone " , Ryan Tedder had co @-@ written Beyoncé 's song " Halo " for her album I Am ... Sasha Fierce . Clarkson later heard " Halo " and noticed distinct similarities between the two songs , most notably in the melancholy piano , loud drums , and handclaps in their backing tracks . She confronted Tedder about using the same arrangement , claiming that people would assume she had stolen it from Knowles . Clarkson tried to have the song removed from All I Ever Wanted , but it was too late to make any changes ; the album was already being pressed and it was not possible to make any changes to the track listing . 
 Tedder responded to the allegations with a statement posted on his MySpace account , arguing that the two songs are " entirely different " and that the criticism was " hurtful and absurd " . He told website Idolator that he was " absolutely livid " , and added , " If I was going around and selling the same track to the biggest artists in the world , how long would my career last ? It ’ s ludicrous . [ ... ] I ’ m not an idiot . I ’ m not the kinda guy who ’ s gonna bust my ass for ten years to try and pull a fast one on Beyoncé or Kelly . " 
 Clarkson fought with her bosses to prevent " Already Gone " from being released as a single , out of respect for Knowles . She wanted " Cry " to be released instead , but conceded that , " in the end , they ’ re releasing it without my consent . It sucks , but it 's one of those things I have no control over ... At this point , the record company can do whatever they want with it . " Tedder , however , was pleased that the song was released , saying that he likes it more than " Halo " . The song was sent to radio airplay on August 11 , 2009 . In September 2009 , Clarkson told MTV that it was unfortunate the two songs sound exactly the same , but noted that they have different vocal melodies . 
 Clarkson continued feuding with Tedder in 2010 . In December 2009 , Tedder said that he was no longer angry over the accusations Clarkson made , but warned , " fool me once , shame on you ; fool me twice , shame on me . [ ... ] I don 't wanna get some crazy @-@ ass backlash or get my head snapped off for writing a hit song . " He later told The Denver Post that he had gotten over the situation and is working on new material for Clarkson 's fifth album . Clarkson , however , told the Daily Star that she is writing and recording new songs with new , low @-@ profile producers . " I don ’ t like working with people who have worked with everyone . Sometimes I get blackmailed into doing so by my label , " she said , " but I prefer collaborating with people who aren 't on the grid . I don ’ t want to sound exactly like other people 's records . " In May , an unreleased electro @-@ pop song by Clarkson called " Wash , Rinse , Repeat " was leaked on the Internet . The song contains auto tuned lyrics that Idolator say are likely written about Tedder : " I can 't take the pressure of new . Give me old , rip it off . / Let 's see if it sticks to the wall again . / Does it sound familiar ? Does it linger in your ear ? / Like something you remember from just last year ? " and " Music from the past , from the present , well , just last week / We will change a note and get away with it , wait and see . " Tedder said that he thinks the song was written about him , too , but admitted he likes the song . " I think Kelly speaks her mind regardless of anything . She 's great with lyrics , and I love that she is her own person . She 's no puppet . " 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " Already Gone " received universal critical acclaim and is regarded as one of the musical and lyrical highlights of All I Ever Wanted . Ryan Brockington from The New York Post called the song a " mixture of old school Stevie Nicks and some Julia Roberts romantic comedy theme song , delivered together in true Clarkson fashion . " He continues , " she spits emotion and heart into a song that makes me want to curl up in a blanket and long for someone " . Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly said Clarkson " knows that the anguish she likes to sing about is enjoyed by millions of people as grandiose admissions of vulnerability . Yet the music that delivers that message is anything but vulnerable . There 's a reason they call them power ballads : a sad song blasted at full volume is a metaphor for finding strength in pain . " His point was echoed by Danton of The Hartford Courant , who stated that Clarkson " pours on the heartache " , and by Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune , who called the song an " extravagant ballad " . 
 Mike Ragogna added that it " already sounds timeless " in The Huffington Post . In the Houston Chronicle , Joey Guerra wrote that " ' Already Gone ' ... is a striking change of pace [ from the other songs on All I Ever Wanted ] . The tempo slows , and Tedder gives Clarkson ’ s vocals a gauzy quality that synchs perfectly with the mournful lyrics . It ’ s an emotive , emotional shot of electricity . " Billboard likened Clarkson 's " ghostly delivery " to that of Sinéad O 'Connor . Jonathan Keefe from Slant Magazine said that " Ryan Tedder 's production on ' Already Gone ' is identical to Beyoncé 's ' Halo ' to the point of distraction , but [ Already Gone ] has a far stronger melody and Clarkson turns in one of her most evocative performances " . On March 5 , 2013 , Billboard ranked the song # 19 in its list of Top 100 American Idol Hits of All Time . 
 Not all reviews were positive , however . Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel wrote that the lyrics are not unique or enlightening , and Tedder 's production on the track was disliked . Jon Caramanica from The New York Times thought that Tedder " drowns [ Clarkson ] under murky piano on ' Already Gone ' . "

" The video begins with Clarkson alone in an apartment wearing a gold gown , sequined elbow gloves , and a large pearl necklace , while lying on a chaise longue . This scene alternates with a second location , where Clarkson wears a black dress , singing in a rehearsal room , surrounded by invisible members of an orchestra playing their instruments . As the video alternates back and forth between the two locations , the scenes are interspersed with slow @-@ motion shots of falling champagne glasses , floating pearls , and flying violins . It uses a shortened version of the song , cutting out the final chorus . 
 The video was uploaded to Clarkson 's official website on July 27 . Following its release , Kahn posted statements to his Twitter account that his vision of the video was not realized , and complained , " I don ’ t think I won a single battle " . A review in Rolling Stone described the video as " boring stuff " , and Leah Collins of Dose said the video was uncontroversial , " unless there 's more meaning to those lingering shots on pearl necklaces than we thought " .

 Due to the controversy surrounding the album version 's similarity with " Halo " , and because Clarkson wanted to perform what she later called a " diva @-@ esque " version of " Already Gone " , she composed a new arrangement with her musical director Jason Halbert for performances during her 2009 All I Ever Wanted Tour . She sings it as part of the concert 's encore . Danton was impressed by the acoustic arrangement when she performed on the first night of her tour in Uncasville , Connecticut , and Keith O 'Connor wrote in The Republican that it was one of the night 's highlights . Lori Hoffman of Atlantic City Weekly described Clarkson 's performance of the song as an " emotional wallop " and a stand @-@ out moment at Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City , New Jersey . Jocelyn Vena from MTV reported that Clarkson 's performance of the song was one of the fans ' favorite moments , and Rolling Stone noted that during her performance at Hammerstein Ballroom , New York , the audience sang " Already Gone " , and Clarkson " was happy to play cheerful conductor , holding up her mic stand to the crowd . " On October 31 , in St. Charles , Missouri , Clarkson mashed " Already Gone " with " Halo " . 
 Clarkson began promoting " Already Gone " on television by debuting it on the Late Show with David Letterman on July 13 , in a live performance in which she " belted out " the lyrics to the reworked arrangement . The same arrangement was used when she sang on VH1 Divas later in the year . Her performance of the song at the 37th Annual American Music Awards was graded as " B + " in the Los Angeles Times , which noted that she was " solid " and " sound [ ed ] terrific " . Jeremy Blacklow from Access Hollywood described it as " pitch @-@ perfect " .

 = Bionic Commando Rearmed = 
 Bionic Commando Rearmed ( <unk> <unk> <unk> , Bionic Commando : Master D Resurrection Project in Japan ) is an enhanced remake of the 1988 Nintendo Entertainment System version of Bionic Commando . It was developed by Grin and published by Capcom for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation Network , and Xbox Live Arcade and was released on August 13 , 2008 . The remake serves as a prelude to the 2009 video game Bionic Commando . A sequel , Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 , was released in February 2011 . 
 Rearmed follows Nathan Spencer , a commando with a bionic left arm that can extend and be used as a weapon , or to swing from various objects . Spencer is sent to destroy a weapon known as the Albatros project under construction by the <unk> . The game was developed using Grin 's Diesel engine and features in @-@ game art by Shinkiro . Music for the game was composed by Simon Viklund and consists largely of remixed versions of the original music . The soundtrack was released on May 27 , 2008 by Sumthing Else Music Works . 
 Rearmed was well received with scores in the 80 % range across all three platforms at aggregate website Metacritic . Reviewers praised the fact that the game was true to the original , and lauded the updated gameplay and graphics . It was described by Hilary Goldstein of IGN as " the best downloadable game to date on [ Xbox Live Arcade ] and [ PlayStation Network ] . " Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com stated Rearmed " should go down in history as one of gaming 's best deals . " 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Bionic Commando Rearmed borrows its plot largely from the NES version of the game . In keeping with the North American release of that version , the references to the Nazi party found in the original Japanese title are not featured in Rearmed . However , as is the case in the original , the final boss of the game still clearly resembles Adolf Hitler , and is referred to as " The Leader " . 
 Rearmed centers around two warring factions : the Federation and the Empire . It begins with the Imperial forces discovering classified documents regarding the development of a secret weapon known as the Albatros project , originally started by an organization known as the <unk> , but never completed . <unk> , Generalissimo of the Empire 's forces , decides to complete the project himself . When the Federation learns of the Empire 's plot , they send in their national hero , Super Joe to infiltrate the Empire . During his mission , Joe is captured by Imperial forces . The Federation sends in a second operative named Nathan Spencer to rescue Super Joe and assist him in completing his mission . 
 Spencer traverses several areas , eliminating many Imperial leaders along his way . As he progresses , he finds new technology and travels deeper behind enemy lines . The plot culminates as Super Joe is rescued from the bionic Imperial soldier Gottfried <unk> , and both Spencer and Joe set out to destroy the Albatros project . During the mission , Spencer encounters " The Leader " , the resurrected head of the Imperial forces . Spencer defeats The Leader , and together with Super Joe destroys the Albatros . The game ends with both heroes hanging onto a helicopter , flying off as the Albatros explodes . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In Bionic Commando Rearmed , the player controls Nathan Spencer , a soldier who has been given a bionic arm . The arm is equipped with several features including a grappling hook which can be used to reach distant objects . The player uses Spencer 's bionic arm to swing across gaps or climb to higher ledges . Often , the player must make a series of grappling actions in a row to successfully traverse hazards such as a wide gap or an electrified floor . 
 Spencer earns a variety of weaponry and items by defeating level bosses . Some items and weapons must be acquired before certain areas can be entered : for example , the player must locate flares that can then be used to illuminate dark areas . Levels are presented to the player as an overworld @-@ style tactical map showing friendly and enemy areas . The player controls a helicopter to move between areas , and can then select to infiltrate that area on foot . While in the overworld view , enemy convoys will also move between areas . If the player 's helicopter encounters a convoy , the player must fight through it on foot before the helicopter can proceed . Such levels are presented from a top @-@ down perspective . 
 While Bionic Commando Rearmed remains mostly true to its NES counterpart , a number of gameplay enhancements were made . A health bar replaces the game 's original health system . Players collect health items from enemies to restore health , as opposed to the original system which involved earning more hit points . Defeating enemies with full health now awards players extra points , encouraging players to avoid being hit in order to obtain high scores . Players can extend Spencer 's bionic arm to grab oil barrels and throw them at enemies , or use them as temporary shields . Weapons can now be changed instantly during gameplay , as opposed to being limited to one weapon per mission . Boss battles have also been redesigned . Each battle now makes unique use of Spencer 's weaponry and bionic arm . In one example , the player must latch the arm to a screw on the boss character 's vehicle , then pull back to expose a weak point in the armor . Additionally , the final boss battle has been extended to a complete level as opposed to the ending sequence of one . Hacking into enemy communications now involves navigating a three @-@ dimensional puzzle as opposed to simply choosing to hack . New to the remake are Challenge rooms which involve using the bionic arm to traverse a course as quickly as possible . Force feedback has been implemented when using the bionic arm , firing weapons , and other events . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 Rearmed 's campaign can be played locally with another player . Although the overall gameplay is identical , enemy AI adapts difficulty to accommodate the extra player . Character lives are shared between players , meaning that each player life lost hurts both players . Once all extra lives are depleted and a player dies , the AI reverts to its single player configuration for the remaining player until that player completes the level or an extra life is found . Additionally the cooperative campaign is saved separately from the solo campaign , meaning that weapons , equipment , and powerups do not carry over from one campaign into the other . During play , the game 's camera will zoom in and out to accommodate both players , and will split the screen dynamically should the camera not be able to zoom any further . Competitive multiplayer modes have also been added , and can be played locally or over a network . Game modes include the standard versus and last man standing modes , and Don 't Touch the Floor , in which characters attempt to knock other players to a hazard at the bottom of the level for points . 
 = = Development and marketing = = 
 Bionic Commando Rearmed developer Grin made it a priority to preserve as much of the original gameplay and visual stylings as possible . Screenshots were taken as a reference , with designers keeping the same color schemes when creating the 3D worlds . Programmers had to reverse engineer the original gameplay to accurately reproduce it . They had to " measure how fast the arm goes out , how fast you swing back and forth , how fast you run across the ground , at what speed you fall down and everything " said Simon Viklund , Creative Director for the game . The level editor was integrated in the engine , which allowed developers to view creations in real time . Lead Gameplay Programmer Håkan Rasmussen expanded on this concept , stating " Since BCR is built on the same engine as the next @-@ gen BC we can also reuse the editor [ which ] lowers the time before we can start using levels . " 
 Developers found that adjusting the original gameplay to a 3D engine required dismissal of conventional physics . For example , the player cannot walk past a barrel placed in their way , however they are able to swing through the object . " The swing mechanic [ is ] based on the original [ and so is ] totally physically incorrect " noted Gameplay Programmer Bertil <unk> . <unk> stated that the character always swings at the same speed and releases at the same angle regardless of player input . Weapons were also redesigned , with each weapon being rebalanced . " In the original [ players get ] the rocket launcher and [ use it ] for the rest of the game " stated Viklund . All of the weapons were redesigned to be useful in some form , and can now all be taken into combat , whereas previously only one weapon could be selected per area . Boss characters received not only a visual redesign , but the fights were redesigned as well to make use of Spencer 's bionic abilities and weaponry . Viklund noted players " need to use the arm to beat the boss " . 
 Challenge rooms were born of a desire to enhance the game 's neutral zones . " The neutral zones in the original game weren 't that interesting , so I starting thinking we could add an obstacle course in each one " , Viklund said . " The bionic arm is such an unconventional mechanic that we really wanted to explore everything that it could offer " , added Level Designer Victor Viklund . Victor Viklund cited inspiration from several NES games , including Solomon 's Key , Wrecking Crew , and Ice Climber , adding that the concept was " very basic , very short stages . " The game 's soundtrack consists of remix versions of the original NES tracks , arranged by Simon Viklund . He described the arrangements as " the same melodies and harmonies but with a more modern sound . " 
 In redesigning the game 's protagonist , Nathan Spencer , Grin cited the characters Iceman from the movie Top Gun and Marty McFly from the Back to the Future series as visual influences in the update . For the character Super Joe , designers looked to the cowboys of the American Old West , citing actor Sam Elliot as an additional source of inspiration . 3D artists noticed early in development that due to the far distance of the camera , certain details in textures would not be noticeable . " We had to think ' less detail and more color [ and ] bigger shapes ' " stated 3D Artists Wendy Young and Peter <unk> . All of the 2D character art was designed by Shinkiro , an illustrator and conceptual artist , famous for his work with the Art of Fighting and The King of Fighters series . 
 Bionic Commando Rearmed - The Soundtrack is the soundtrack of video game music from Bionic Commando Rearmed . It was released on May 27 , 2008 by Sumthing Else Music Works . The music was composed by Simon Viklund , who later provided the arranged soundtrack for Final Fight : Double Impact . The music is largely remixed from the original game . Viklund took the original tracks written by Junko Tamiya and rearranged them in Buzz , a freeware virtual studio program . A Japanese trailer for the game was revealed at San Diego Comic @-@ con 2008 , done in the style of an anime opening with a theme song sung by <unk> Mizuki , titled " Go Go Bionic " . 
 On February 19 , 2008 the official Bionic Commando website ran a poll asking gamers to decide between two possible prices for Rearmed — ten or fifteen dollars . Producer Ben Judd stated , " Personally , since the goal is to make this game for the fans and to get the world to see what makes Bionic Commando so special , I want to sell it for about US $ 10 . " However , more senior Capcom employees believed that the game has enough features and polish to sell well enough at <unk> to warrant that price . Final pricing was settled on <unk> for the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network versions , and <unk> for the Windows version . The PlayStation 3 version supports Remote Play on PlayStation Portable and trophies .

 Bionic Commando Rearmed has been very well received by game critics . It averages 86 / 100 across all three release platforms at aggregate website Metacritic and average 87 % across platforms at GameRankings . Rearmed sold over 130 @,@ 000 copies across all three platforms during the first week of its release . As of year @-@ end 2010 , Bionic Commando Rearmed has sold over 113 @,@ 000 copies on Xbox Live alone . That number rose to over 119 @,@ 000 at year @-@ end 2011 . In a September 2010 ranking , IGN listed Bionic Commando Rearmed fourth in their top twenty @-@ five Xbox Live Arcade titles of all time . Overall impressions of the game gleaned comments of praise . IGN 's Hilary Goldstein called Rearmed " the best downloadable game to date on XBLA and PSN " and ranked it second on her top 10 list of Xbox Live Arcade games . Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb called it " terrific in almost every way " and the reviewer from GameTrailers stated it was " one of those games that feels organic to play . " Reviewers praised the title 's ability to remain true to the NES version but provide enhancements to update the title . 
 The game 's graphics received high marks from reviews . Hilary <unk> of IGN described as " gorgeous " and added that Rearmed is " one of the prettiest downloadable games ever made . " Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb also lauded the visuals and praised the color palette , backgrounds and lighting . He further noted the game 's ability to remain loyal to the original visual presentation . " [ It ] makes enough visual references to the old game to trigger that feeling of nostalgia , but it never uses the old stuff as a crutch " stated Gerstmann . Similar praise was given in respect to the game 's soundtrack , with 1UP.com 's Jeremy Parish calling it " exceptional " and " a mix good enough to enjoy outside the context of the game " . The reviewer from GameZone also gave praise for the remixed music . They called it " simultaneously retro and hip . " 
 Reviewers were split on opinions of the game 's AI , with IGN 's Hilary <unk> describing it as " the best seen in a side @-@ scrolling game " , but Tom McShea of GameSpot saying the enemies were " simply too limited to pose much of a threat " . Multiple reviewers were disappointed in the game controls , citing the lack of updating to analog features and remaining too true to the original . Rearmed 's multiplayer received generally high acclaim , with GameSpot 's Tom McShea calling it " an unexpected treat " . Both the game 's cooperative and competitive modes were lauded , however some critics cited a lack of online functionality . Reviewer Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com also praised the game 's challenge maps and in @-@ game database , stating " Rearmed is a game that could easily sell for full retail price and seem like a good deal .

 Bionic Commando Rearmed 2 was revealed at Capcom 's Captivate 2010 event . It was developed by <unk> and released on the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network and the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade on February 1 , 2011 and February 2 , 2011 , respectively . The game adds new weapons and abilities , including the optional ability to jump , a maneuver absent in previous 2D titles . The sequel 's plot revolves around a dictator named General <unk> and a missing commander from Spencer 's organization , Colonel Brubaker . Spencer and a team of four other <unk> are sent to locate Brubaker and his platoon and help them complete their mission of disarming <unk> 's missiles . Rearmed 2 was not as well received as the original game . Aggregate website GameRankings reports scores in the 60 % range for both platforms . The PlayStation 3 version of the game was criticized for its DRM requirement to be signed into the PlayStation Network in order to play the game . 
 = Tropical Storm Carrie ( 1972 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Carrie was a strong tropical storm that affected the East Coast of the United States in early September 1972 . The third tropical cyclone of the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season , Carrie formed on August 29 from a complex sequence of meteorological events starting with the emergence of a tropical wave into the Atlantic in the middle of August . Tracking generally northward throughout its life , Carrie reached an initial peak intensity as a moderate tropical storm before nearly weakening back into tropical depression status . The storm began to reintensify in a baroclinic environment after turning toward the northwest ; its winds of 70 miles per hour ( 110 km / h ) as it was transitioning into an extratropical system eclipsed the cyclone 's previous maximum strength . The extratropical remnants of Carrie skirted eastern New England before making landfall in Maine on September 4 and dissipating over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence during the next two days . 
 Carrie had a minimal impact on the East Coast south of New England , limited to increased swells , gusty winds , and light rainfall . The worst conditions occurred over southeastern New England , where wind gusts reached 84 mph ( 135 km / h ) and rainfall exceeded 1 ft ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) . Damage was most severe along and slightly inland from the coast . Thousands of people became stranded on offshore islands of Massachusetts after dangerous conditions created by the storm prompted the suspension of steamship service . Overall damage was generally light , with total monetary losses valued at $ 1 @,@ 780 @,@ 000 , and four deaths are blamed on the storm . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Tropical Storm Carrie are traced back to a tropical wave — an elongated area of low atmospheric air pressure — that emerged from the western coast of Africa on August 15 , 1972 . A relatively strong weather system , the wave progressed westward , but by the time it had reached the Leeward Islands ten days later , it had degenerated substantially . The influence of a nearby upper @-@ level low pressure system caused the disturbance to further deteriorate , and the resultant remnant circulation drifted toward the northwest ; by August 28 , it was situated at a position just offshore southeastern Florida . The low pressure system maintained a cold core and had not yet established itself at the surface . On August 29 , the low began moving northward in response to an approaching trough . For the first time , a low @-@ level circulation center had been identified in association with the system , and the storm became a tropical depression at 1200 UTC while located east of the central Florida peninsula . The depression tracked steadily northeastward as it gradually intensified . 
 On August 31 , reconnaissance aircraft flying into the cyclone reported maximum sustained winds of up to around 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) . Post @-@ storm reanalysis estimated the depression had strengthened into a tropical storm at around 0000 UTC on August 31 . Operationally , however , it was not recognized as such until 2200 UTC that day , when it was assigned the name Carrie . At the time , the system was located approximately 350 miles ( 560 km ) east of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina . A small storm , Carrie slowed drastically in forward movement as it curved northward . By the time it was identified as a tropical storm in real @-@ time , Carrie had already reached its initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) and a minimum central pressure of 1 @,@ 002 millibars ( 29 @.@ 6 inHg ) , and strong wind shear inhibited immediate strengthening as it continue to slow to a drift . On September 1 , Carrie began to weaken , and by early on September 2 , it had dwindled to a minimal tropical storm with winds of only 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) . Satellite imagery indicated that the storm 's center of circulation had become distorted with little or no associated convection . At its weakest , the storm 's highest winds were found far from the center , likely generated more by the increasing pressure gradient in relation to an anticyclone to the north than by the low pressure center itself . 
 A low pressure system moving through the Mid @-@ Atlantic states pulled Carrie northwest , back toward the United States East Coast , at an accelerated forward speed . Later on September 2 , the storm had begun to show signs of reorganization , including an improved appearance on satellite imagery and the development of some thunderstorm activity , although significant reintensification was considered unlikely . However , with the advance of a trough embedded in the westerlies , Carrie quickly deepened under the influence of baroclinic processes . While the storm 's maximum sustained winds increased , it also began to shed its tropical characteristics and resemble an extratropical cyclone . Moving once again toward the north @-@ northeast , Carrie was declared extratropical by the National Hurricane Center during the late afternoon on September 2 . In the official Atlantic Hurricane Database , however , Carrie is listed as a tropical cyclone until 1800 UTC on September 3 , at which point it possessed winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) and a central barometric pressure of 993 mb ( 29 @.@ 3 inHg ) . As a result , these data are considered representative of the storm 's peak intensity . Regardless of its status , the storm was a large and intense system as it progressed north and neared New England , generating strong winds and rough surf along the coast . Having fully transitioned into an extratropical system , the storm made landfall near Eastport , Maine on September 4 and slowly weakened as it continued north up the Gulf of Saint Lawrence . The cyclone fully dissipated on September 6 in the Gulf . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 The pressure gradient between Carrie and the high pressure area to its north produced gusty northeasterly winds , and by extension high seas . In response , the National Weather Service issued small craft warnings starting on September 1 and extending from Massachusetts to the Carolinas . Gale warnings were posted the next day from southern New Jersey to the coast of central New England , and the small craft warnings were brought north to Maine . Ongoing , as well as the threat of continued heavy rainfall necessitated the issuance of flash flood watches throughout eastern Massachusetts , southeastern New Hampshire , and southern and central Maine on September 3 . Due to rough surf , the beach at Virginia Beach , Virginia was closed to swimmers on August 31 . 
 = = = Mid @-@ Atlantic = = = 
 Carrie had minimal effects on the East Coast south of the Mid @-@ Atlantic states , limited to moderate winds and generally light rainfall . Precipitation at Norfolk , Virginia reached 1 @.@ 12 inches ( 28 mm ) between September 1 and 3 , and pressure fell to a modest 1 @,@ 012 mb ( 29 @.@ 9 inHg ) . Sustained winds were recorded at 28 mph ( 45 km / h ) , with only slightly higher gusts , although the Chesapeake Light unofficially reported gusts to near 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . Damage in the area was minimal with the exception of beach erosion , and tides 2 @.@ 5 feet ( 0 @.@ 76 m ) above normal triggered minor flooding . Moderate rainfall , approaching or reaching 5 in ( 130 mm ) , fell across the southern Delmarva Peninsula . Equally minor effects were felt in the Atlantic City , New Jersey , area , with comparable or even less significant reports of winds and rainfall and damages limited to coastal flooding and beach erosion . Since the adverse weather conditions fell on a portion of the Labor Day weekend , the local resort industry suffered economical losses . 
 = = = New England and Canada = = = 
 The brunt of the storm occurred in southeastern New England , particularly coastal Massachusetts , where strong gusts battered the shore . The distribution of winds resulting from the storm more closely resembled that of a nor 'easter than a cyclone of tropical origin , in which the wind field would typically be concentrated closer to its center . Instead , the strongest winds remained well removed from the center of circulation , but were nonetheless severe ; gusts reached 84 mph ( 135 km / h ) at Point Judith , Rhode Island , and 69 mph ( 111 km / h ) on Cape Cod , Massachusetts . Sustained winds throughout the region were generally below 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . In Boston , Massachusetts , winds gusted to 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) . The storm brought down trees and powerlines , blocking roads and damaging property . Structural damage was also evident , especially to buildings under construction , and an entire cottage in Rockland , Maine was blown off its foundation . 
 Rainfall in southeastern New England was heavy , locally exceeding 10 in ( 250 mm ) . On the island of Martha 's Vineyard , a storm total of 12 @.@ 5 in ( 320 mm ) was reported , the highest known precipitation sum resulting from Carrie . The most torrential rains were usually confined to within 70 mi ( 110 km ) of the coast . The deluge swelled streams , inundated cellars , and washed out a railroad near Eagle Lake , Maine , derailing a train . Along the coast , rough surf caused beach erosion and swamped hundreds of small craft . On September 3 , choppy conditions forced the suspension of steamship services to and from the mainland and the islands of Martha 's Vineyard and Nantucket . Thousands of tourists and seasonal residents became stranded on the islands , creating what officials described as a " logistical problem " . During the height of the storm , around 20 @,@ 000 Narragansett Electric Company customers lost power , with scattered power outages reported elsewhere throughout New England . 
 In general , damage from Tropical Storm Carrie and its extratropical remnants was light . Total monetary damage was estimated at $ 1 @,@ 780 @,@ 000 in 1972 terms , of which $ 1 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 in losses was inflicted on Massachusetts . Losses totaled $ 350 @,@ 000 in Rhode Island , $ 200 @,@ 000 in Maine , and $ 30 @,@ 000 in New Hampshire . Four fatalities were attributed to the storm : two in the aftermath of boating accidents in Massachusetts , and two due to rough surf along the coast of Maine . In the aftermath , a local disaster area was declared for the town of Plymouth . The weakening remnants of Carrie produced strong winds throughout New Brunswick on September 5 and 6 , peaking at 69 mph ( 111 km / h ) . In Saint John , where wind gusts reached 49 mph ( 79 km / h ) , there were reports of downed telephone wires and trees . Widespread power outages occurred throughout communities in the province . Only light rain fell in Saint John , and no flooding was evident . The storm damaged or destroyed numerous boats in <unk> , New Brunswick . 
 Oceanic currents produced by the storm washed cells of the harmful alga <unk> <unk> south and west into the coastal waters of New England . The alga releases toxins that cause shellfish poisoning and is native to the Bay of Fundy . Several weeks after the storm , a massive bloom of the alga occurred offshore the northeastern United States for the first time , and the species bloomed every year post @-@ Carrie . 
 = Washington Redskins name controversy = 
 The Washington Redskins name controversy involves the name and logo of the National Football League ( NFL ) franchise located in the Washington , D.C. , metropolitan area . Native American individuals , tribes and organizations have been questioning the use of the name and image for decades . Over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights , educational , athletic , and scientific experts have published resolutions or policies that state that the use of Native American names and / or symbols by non @-@ native sports teams is a harmful form of ethnic stereotyping that promotes misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans . The Washington , D.C. team is only one example of the larger controversy , but it receives the most public attention due to the name itself being defined as derogatory or insulting in modern dictionaries , and the prominence of the team representing the nation 's capital . 
 Native Americans officially demanding change include hundreds of tribal nations , national tribal organizations , civil rights organizations , school boards , sports teams , and individuals . The largest of these organizations , the National Congress of American Indians , count the total enrollment of its membership as 1 @.@ 2 million individuals . There is also a growing number of public officials , sports commentators and other journalists advocating a change . In addition to picketing and other forms of direct protest , opponents took legal action to cancel the trademarks held by the team . On June 18 , 2014 , the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ( TTAB ) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) again voted to cancel the Redskins federal trademark registrations , considering them " disparaging to Native Americans " . On July 8 , 2015 the U.S. District Court in Alexandria , Virginia upheld the TTAB decision . 
 Support for continued use of the name has come from the team 's owners and a majority of fans , which include some Native Americans . Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans , and that it is not intended in a negative manner . Some , such as team president Bruce Allen , also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams , two on reservations , that have a majority of Native American students . Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll done by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004 , In a commentary published soon after that poll , fifteen Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion , it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism . In May , 2016 the Washington Post published a poll which duplicated the central question posed in 2004 , yielding an identical result . Critics immediately questioned the methodology , which addressed some but not all of the flaws they found in the Annenberg poll ; but also questioned reducing a complex civil rights issue to a matter of personal opinion . National public opinion polls consistently find that a majority of the general public support the team 's continued use of the name , ranging from 60 to 83 percent in recent years . However , three separate DC metropolitan area polls have found that a small majority of fans think the term " redskin " is offensive to Native Americans in some contexts . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1933 the football team that shared both the name and playing field with the Boston Braves baseball team moved to Fenway Park , already home to the Boston Red Sox . Co @-@ owner George Preston Marshall changed the name to the Redskins , more likely to avoid confusion while retaining the " Indian " imagery of the team than to honor coach William Henry " Lone Star " Dietz . The logo for the NFL Braves was similar to the current logo , a Native American head in profile with braids and trailing feathers . The current logo , proposed by Walter Wetzel , a former Blackfeet tribal chairman and president of the National Congress of American Indians , was introduced in 1972 and is modeled after the likeness on the Buffalo nickel . Members of the Blackfeet tribe today express a range of opinions , from support to indifference to strong opposition to the Redskins name based upon their personal experiences . 
 = = = Origin and meaning = = = 
 Much of the public debate is over the meaning of the word " redskin " , with team supporters frequently citing a paper by Ives Goddard , a Smithsonian Institution senior linguist and curator emeritus , who asserts that the term was originally benign in meaning . However , in an interview Goddard admits that it is impossible to verify if the native words were accurately translated . But then " nigger " also began as a benign reference to skin color , only to become a racial slur through disparaging usage . Dr. Darren R. Reid , a history lecturer at Coventry University also states that Native American usage was generally attributed to them by European writers . Reid states that the team logo works together with the name to reinforce an unrealistic stereotype : " It is not up to non @-@ Indians to define an idealized image of what it is to a Native American . " The " positive " stereotypes allow fans and supporters to honestly state that they are honoring Native Americans , but this is " ... forcing your idea of what it is to honour those people onto them and that , fundamentally , is disrespectful . " 
 Advocates of changing the name emphasize current meanings in dictionaries of American English , which include " usually offensive " , " disparaging " , " insulting " , and " taboo " . Such meanings are consistent with the usage found in books in the period between 1875 and 1930 , which is after that studied by Goddard . In the Washington Redskins trademark litigation , the linguistic expert for the petitioners , Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg , successfully argued that whatever its origins , " redskins " was a slur at the time of the trademarks , based upon the passages from books and newspapers and the movie clips in which the word is inevitably associated with contempt , derision , condescension , or sentimental paeans to the noble savage . John McWhorter , an associate professor of linguistics at Columbia University compares the name 's becoming a slur to the other racial terms , such as " Oriental " which acquired implied meanings associated with contempt . 
 Some defenders of the name point to Native American use of the term , including three predominantly Native American high schools with the Redskins mascot . Native American writer and attorney <unk> Ross compares Native American use of variations of the r @-@ word with African @-@ American use of variations of the n @-@ word . The use of these terms by some members of minority communities does not mean that these words may be used by outsiders . Ross also notes that while activism on the issue may be from a minority of Native Americans , this is due to most being concerned with more immediate issues , but also says " The presentation of the name ' Redskins ' is problematic for many Native Americans because it identifies Natives in a way that the vast majority of Natives simply don 't identity ourselves . " 
 A controversial etymological claim is that the term emerged from the practice of paying a bounty for Indians , and that " redskin " refers to the bloody scalp of Native Americans . Although official documents do not use the word in this way , an historical association between the use of " redskin " and the paying of bounties can be made . In 1863 , a Winona , MN newspaper , the Daily Republican , printed an announcement : " The state reward for dead Indians has been increased to $ 200 for every red @-@ skin sent to Purgatory . This sum is more than the dead bodies of all the Indians east of the Red River are worth . " A news story published by the Atchison Daily Champion in Atchison , Kansas on October 9 , 1885 , tells of the settlers " hunt for redskins , with a view of obtaining their scalps " valued at $ 250 . This association can evoke strongly negative sentiments . In a 2014 interview after the Trademark decision , Amanda Blackhorse the lead petitioner expressed her opinion : " The name itself actually dates back [ to ] the time when the Native American population was being exterminated , and bounty hunters were hired to kill Native American people ... So , in order to show that they made their kill , they had to bring back a scalp or their skin . "

 The issue is often discussed in the media in terms of offensiveness , which reduced it to feelings and opinions , and prevents full understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated . Social science research says that sports mascots and images , rather than being mere entertainment , are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects . <unk> may directly affect academic performance and self @-@ esteem of Native American youth , whose people face high rates of suicide , unemployment , and poverty . Euro @-@ Americans exposed to mascots may be more likely to believe not only that such stereotypes are true , but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes . Research demonstrates the harm of stereotyping , with studies showing that exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking among citizens with regard to other groups . 
 Advocates of changing the team 's name say that use of stereotypes of Native Americans must be understood in the context of a history that includes conquest , forced relocation , and organized efforts by federal and state governments to eradicate native cultures , such as the boarding schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries . " Since the first Europeans made landfall in North America , native peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes , misconceptions and caricatures . Whether portrayed as noble savages , ignoble savages , teary @-@ eyed environmentalists or , most recently , simply as casino @-@ rich , native peoples find their efforts to be treated with a measure of respect and integrity undermined by images that flatten complex tribal , historical and personal experience into one @-@ dimensional representations that tells us more about the <unk> than about the depicted . " 
 In addition to the names and images , Native Americans opposed to mascots point to the oversimplification of their culture by fans " playing Indian " with no understanding of the deeper meaning of feathers , face paint , chants , and dancing . Dr. Richard Lapchick , director emeritus of Northeastern University 's Center for the Study of Sport in Society , in an article : " Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in black face at a game ? Yet go to a game where there is a team with an Indian name and you will see fans with war paint on their faces . Is this not the equivalent to black face ? " The unofficial mascot of the Redskins team was <unk> Williams ( aka Chief Zee ) , an African American man who attended games beginning in 1978 dressed in a red , faux " Indian " costume , complete with feathered war bonnet and tomahawk . Other fans often dress in similar costume for the games . 
 The Redskins controversy began receiving more attention in 2013 , starting with a symposium in February on the topic at the Smithsonian 's National Museum of the American Indian in Washington , D.C. Subsequently the Oneida Indian Nation of New York sponsored a series of radio ads in each city to coincide with games of the 2013 season , each featuring a targeted message . A broader range of persons spoke out in favor of change or open discussion , including local government leaders , members of Congress , and President Barack Obama . Statements in support of a name change by civil rights and religious organizations were added to those that Native American groups have been making for decades . Direct action in the form of rallies and marches have become more frequent , with a larger number of participants . 
 The owner and the NFL Commissioner , supporters of keeping the name and logo , say they believe that it refers positively to Native Americans , invoking qualities of strength and courage . The majority of scholars argue that the use of any stereotype , whether positive or negative , is a hindrance to the advancement of the targeted group . Scott B. Vickers wrote , " the use of any stereotype in the portrayal of Indians is considered ... to be contributory to their dehumanization and <unk> . " The national organizations representing several academic disciplines , after reviewing the research done on the issue , have passed resolutions calling for the end of all Native American mascots and images in sports . These include the Society of Indian Psychologists ( 1999 ) , the American Counseling Association ( 2001 ) , the American Psychological Association ( 2005 ) , the American Sociological Association ( 2007 ) . and the American Anthropological Association ( 2015 ) . The executive board of the nation 's leading organization of scholars of U.S. history approved a resolution in April 2015 : " The Organization of American Historians hereby adds its voice to the growing demands by Native American organizations , our sister disciplines , and conscientious people of all ethnic backgrounds , to change the name and logo of the Washington " Redskins . " 
 In a report published by the Center for American Progress summarizing the research on " The Real Impact of Native Mascots and Team Names on American Indian and Alaska Native Youth " , a case is made that the public debate misses the point , since individual opinions on either side do not matter given the measurable effects on the mental health of Native American young people exposed to such misrepresentations of their ethnic identity , and the often hostile or insulting behavior of non @-@ natives that occur when teams with such names and mascots play . Clinical Psychologist Michael Friedman writes that the use of Native imagery , in particular the use of a dictionary defined slur , is a form of bullying , the negative impact of which is magnified by its being officially sanctioned . 
 The controversy has crossed the Atlantic in response to the scheduling of a game between the Redskins and the Cincinnati Bengals at Wembley Stadium in London for October 30 , 2016 . In a letter to the NFL from two members of parliament , Ruth <unk> and Ian Austin said that the Redskins name goes " directly " against the values of British citizens . In addition , the stadium and the BBC have policies that would not allow for the use of a racial slur . The solution would be either to change the name or send another team .

 In the 1940s the National Congress of American Indians ( NCAI ) created a campaign to eliminate negative stereotyping of Native American people in the media . Over time , the campaign began to focus on Indian names and mascots in sports . The NCAI maintains that teams with mascots such as the Braves and the Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native American people , and demean their native traditions and rituals . The NCAI issued a new report in 2013 summarizing opposition to Indian mascots and team names generally , and the Washington Redskins in particular . In the trademark case , the TTAB placed significance on the NCAI opposition , estimating that the organization represented about 30 % of the Native American population at the time the trademarks were granted , which met their criteria for a " substantial composite " of Native Americans finding the name disparaging . In its amicus brief filed in the case , the NCAI states that the combined enrollment of its member tribes in 2013 as 1 @.@ 2 million individuals . 
 In addition , many tribal councils have passed resolutions or issued statements regarding their opposition to the name of the Washington Redskins , including the Cherokee and Comanche Nations of Oklahoma , the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona , the Inter @-@ Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes , the Oneida Indian Nation ( New York ) , the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe ( North Dakota ) and the United South and Eastern Tribes ( USET ) . In April 2014 , Navajo Nation Council voted in favor of a statement opposing the name of the Washington team , as well as other disparaging references to American Indians by other professional sports franchises . 
 Other Native American groups advocating change include : the American Indian College Fund , National Indian Child Welfare Association , National Indian Education Association , National Indian Youth Council , National Native American Law Student Association , Native American Journalists Association , and Native American Rights Fund ( NARF ) . 
 Individuals Native Americans who are or have been actively opposed to the Redskins ' name include author and recent Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Suzan Shown <unk> ( Cheyenne / <unk> Muscogee ) , Former U.S. Senator Ben <unk> Campbell ( Northern Cheyenne ) , director of The Smithsonian Institution 's National Museum of the American Indian Kevin Gover ( Pawnee ) , author Sherman <unk> ( Spokane ) , historian and author Vine <unk> , Jr .

 At its annual conference the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights ( <unk> ) , which includes the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union as members , passed a unanimous resolution of the 85 representatives present that , while recognizing that a business has the First Amendment right to use any name that it chooses , others need not be complicit in the use of a pejorative and insulting name ; and calling upon all Federal , state and local government entities " to end any preferential tax , zoning , or policy treatment that could be viewed as supporting the franchise as long as it retains its current team name " . The resolution also commended the " current and former government officials , media outlets , and other entities that have encouraged the Washington Redskins franchise to change its team name or that have refused to be complicit in promoting the current team name " . In response , the team released a brief statement reiterated their previous position , and quoting two individuals as being both Native American and Redskins fans who do not want the name to change . The <unk> issued a press release in 2014 applauding the decision to cancel the trademark protection for the team 's name . The NAACP issued their own press release supporting the TTAB decision stating " The NAACP has called specifically for this name change since 1992 , and will continue to stand with the Native Indian community until the derogatory moniker has been changed . " 
 The Fritz Pollard Alliance , a non @-@ profit organization closely allied with the NFL on civil rights issues , has decided to announce its support of a name change after repeated attempts to discuss the issue with the team owner and representatives . An attorney for the Alliance , N. Jeremi <unk> , an American University law professor , made a study of the controversy in which he concluded that Native Americans are justified in finding the name offensive . 
 In 1992 , the Central Conference of American Rabbis issued a resolution calling for the end of sports teams names that promote racism , in particular the Atlanta Braves and the Washington Redskins . The Anti @-@ Defamation League was one of the organizations signing a letter to broadcasters urging them to avoid using the name . The Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism also advocates a name change . 
 In 2013 a group of sixty @-@ one religious leaders in Washington , D.C. sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and team owner Dan Snyder stating their moral obligation to join the Change the Mascot movement due to the offensive and inappropriate nature of the name which causes pain whether or not that is intended . 
 In June , 2015 the United Church of Christ General Synod passed a resolution calling for a stop to using images or mascots that could be demeaning to the Native American community . 
 In June , 2016 Sidwell Friends School , affiliated with the Quakers , amended it dress code to ban apparel with the Redskins name or logo as " offensive and antithetical to the values of the community " .

 Although often assumed to be a debate of recent origins , the local Washington , DC newspapers have published news items on the controversy many times since at least 1971 , all in response to Native American individuals or organizations asking for the name to be changed . National protests began in 1988 , after the team 's Super Bowl XXII victory , prompting numerous Native Americans wrote letters to Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke while others boycotted Redskins products and protested , but Cooke rejected the possibility of change . There was a protest of about 2 @,@ 000 people at the 1992 Super Bowl between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills . The American Indian Movement 's ( AIM ) Vernon Bellecourt was one of the main organizers of the protest . 
 Since 2013 picketing at the stadiums has occurred occasionally when the Redskins have played , particularly in cities with a significant population of Native Americans ; such as Dallas , Denver and Minneapolis . The latter protest was supported by several Minnesota politicians . <unk> resumed for the 2014 season in Glendale , AZ when the team played the Arizona Cardinals , and again the largest rally was in <unk> where estimates of the number of protestors was between 3 @,@ 500 and 5 @,@ 000 . 
 FedEx owns the naming rights to the team 's stadium , FedEx Field through 2026 , and has been the only corporate sponsor officially subject to boycotts by Native Americans : the Osage Nation , the Native American Rights Fund ( NARF ) and the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes , the largest tribe of Native Alaskan peoples .

 Following the February 2013 symposium " Racist Stereotypes and Cultural Appropriation in American Sports " at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian , ten members of Congress sent a letter to the team owner and the NFL Commissioner requesting that the name be changed since it is offensive to Native Americans . In response , team owner Daniel Snyder famously told USA Today : " We 'll never change the name . ... It 's that simple . NEVER — you can use caps . " Snyder sent an open letter to fans that was published in The Washington Post on October 9 , 2013 in which he stated that the most important meaning of the name Redskins is the association that fans have to memories of their personal history with the team . Snyder also states that the name was chosen in 1933 to honor Native Americans in general and the coach and four players at that time who were Native American ; and that in 1971 the then coach George Allen consulted with the Red Cloud Indian Fund on the Pine Ridge reservation when designing the logo . In 2013 the Red Cloud Athletic Fund sent a letter to the Washington Post stating that " As an organization , Red Cloud Indian School has never — and will never — endorse the use of the name " Redskins . " Like many Native American organizations across the country , members of our staff and extended community find the name offensive . " 
 In June 2013 Roger Goodell defended the name by citing its origins , traditions and polls that support its popularity . 
 On their website the team states that the 2014 annual NFL poll showing 71 percent support for the name , " along with the poll taken among Native Americans by the Annenberg Institute , demonstrates continued , widespread and deep opposition to the Redskins changing our name ... We respect the point of view of the small number of people who seek a name change , but it is important to recognize very few people agree with the case they are making . " 
 The team 's president , Bruce Allen addressed a letter dated May 23 , 2014 to Senator Reid repeating the position that the name was originated by Native Americans to refer to themselves , that the logo was also designed and approved by Native American leaders , that the vast majority of both Native Americans and the public do not find the name offensive . 
 Defense of the Redskins name has come mainly from conservatives , such as George Will , Pat Buchanan , W. James <unk> III , Rich Lowry , Dennis Prager , Rush Limbaugh , and Glenn Beck .

 In May 2013 , the Redskins ' website reported the opinions of a local fan , Stephen D.

" He said that not only was " Redskins " not offensive to him and his " whole family " , but it was a " term of endearment " that Indians " on the reservation ... would call each other " . NFL commissioner Roger Goodell wrote a letter to Congress , which in part pointed to " recent remarks from Chief Steven Dodson , an American Inuit chief " to indicate support for the nickname among Native Americans . Soon it was reported that the Redskins ' " full @-@ blooded American Inuit chief " was " neither , and " Chief " was only a nickname , including being on a list of <unk> from court records related to " theft , paternity , and domestic violence matters . " The executive director of the Inuit Circumpolar Council @-@ Alaska , said that neither " Chief " nor " Indian " are terms used by Alaska 's native peoples 
 A brother and sister in Oneida , New York , state they are both Native American ( Mohawk ) and ardent Redskins fans . Three Virginia Indian leaders say they are not offended by the name Redskins , but are more concerned about other issues such as the lack of Federal recognition for any Virginia tribe . Robert " Two Eagles " Green , retired chief of the Fredericksburg area <unk> Tribe , stated on a radio talk show he 'd be offended if the team does change its name . In an article in The American Spectator , the current chief of the <unk> Tribe , John <unk> , states that while he is not offended by the current name , he would support changing the team to the Washington <unk> . 
 On November 25 , 2013 as part of the NFL 's " Salute to Service " month and Native American Heritage month , the Washington Redskins recognized four members of the Navajo Code Talkers Association briefly during a commercial break . One of them , Roy Hawthorne , has stated , " My opinion is that 's a name that not only the team should keep , but that 's a name that 's American . " This action was criticized by Amanda Blackhorse , also Navajo , and described as a publicity stunt . In April 2014 , Navajo Nation Council voted in favor of a statement opposing the name of the Washington team , as well as other disparaging references to American Indians by other professional sports franchises . Later that year , members of the Navajo and Zuni Tribes and students from the Red Mesa Redskins High School attended a game in support of the Redskins . 
 The Redskins released a two @-@ minute video on YouTube entitled " Redskins is a Powerful Name " in which a number of Native Americans express their support for the team .

 Supporters note that three predominantly Native American high schools use the name Redskins for their sports teams , suggesting that it can be acceptable . However , the principal of one of these , Red Mesa High School in Teec Nos Pos , Arizona , said that use of the word outside American Indian communities should be avoided because it could perpetuate " the legacy of negativity that the term has created . " In 2014 , <unk> High School , located on the Spokane Indian Reservation voted to keep the Redskins name . 
 The number of high schools using the Redskins name has been in steady decline , forty percent having had local efforts to change the name . From 1988 until April 2013 , 28 high schools in 18 states had done so . Subsequently , 11 additional high schools changed , with two additional schools in California also required to do so by January 1 , 2017 .

 Two professors at the <unk> Business School at Emory University summarized their research in a New York Times editorial . Studies of college teams that have changed their names and mascots indicate that doing so has a long @-@ term financial benefit . While vocal opponents of change often threatened withdrawal of support , these never materialized . There have been no name changes by professional teams ; however , a comparison of NFL teams shows the highest negative trend in brand equity being the Washington Redskins and the Kansas City Chiefs , calling into question the business logic of retaining Native American names or logos that are offensive to even a minority . In a commentary for Forbes , Tom Van Riper states that research specifically considering the fan loyalty and traditions of the team indicates that the value of the name as a brand is significant , and unlikely to change for business reasons . However , an alternative opinion is that the team would benefit from a re @-@ branding , but any new name would need to be carefully selected . 2014 sales of Redskins merchandise declined 35 % from the prior year . " People are having a second thoughts about wearing a T @-@ shirt with the logo or name that it has now been called racist , " said Matt Powell , senior analyst for <unk> . A team spokesman attributed the decline to dismal performance in the 2013 season , but other teams with bad records have not seen such a steep decline in sales . Corporate sponsors have either made no public response to media inquiries regarding the name or stated that they play no role in the decision , and defer to the team and the NFL . Despite the name controversy , the value of the team has risen $ 700 million to $ 2 @.@ 4 billion ( 40 % ) , making them the third most valuable franchise in the NFL , based upon the valuations published by Forbes magazine in 2014 and 2015 .

 Although the majority of those advocating a name change are Democrats , there is no indication that the issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans are such a small percentage of the electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election . There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population : Alaska , Arizona , Montana , New Mexico , North Dakota , Oklahoma , South Dakota and Wyoming . However , polls show a definite political difference in the opinion of the general public , with only 58 % of Democrats opposing a name change versus 89 % of Republicans . Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action . There have also been non @-@ binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in New Jersey and passed in Minneapolis , New York State and California . 
 The topic came up in a 2013 interview of President Barack Obama , who stated that if he were the owner of the Redskins , he would consider changing the name because it offends many Native Americans , but that he didn 't " have a stake " in the issue as he is not an owner of a professional sports team . However , in November , 2015 Obama , speaking at the White House Tribal Nations Conference , stated " Names and mascots of sports teams like the Washington Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native Americans " and praised Adidas for a new initiative to help schools change names and mascots by designing new logos and paying for part of the cost of new uniforms . On May 22 , 2014 , fifty U.S. Senators , forty @-@ eight Democrats and two Independents , sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Goodell asking the league , referencing the Donald Sterling case , " send the same clear message as the NBA did : that racism and bigotry have no place in professional sports .

 Much of the local political discussion has been about building a stadium , beginning in the 1990s when a Maryland location was chosen for the what is now FedEx Field . With the possibility of building a new stadium in the near future , both the previous and current mayors of the District of Columbia have stated that a name change must be part of the discussion , however the team rejects that <unk> . Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has met with the owner to discuss the building of a new stadium in Virginia . For many years , beginning with the departure of the Baltimore Colts , the Redskins were the only NFL team in a large area from Maryland into the southern states . This is slowly changing as Maryland NFL fans move to the Baltimore Ravens . Several Maryland politicians have stated that the name should change , but the current governor opposes any change , also citing the desire to keep the stadium in Maryland . Virginia fans are now the more numerous and dedicated supporters of the Redskins , and the state and local governments have used economic incentives to encourage the team 's relocation of its facilities there , and maintain that the name is entirely a business decision for the team to make . An agency of the commonwealth , the Virginia Lottery , is a sponsor of the team , and says it has never had any complaints . 
 = = = Trademark cases = = = 
 In 1992 , Suzan Shown <unk> , with six other prominent Native Americans petitioned the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) to cancel the trademark registrations owned by Pro @-@ Football , Inc . In 1999 the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ( TTAB ) judges canceled the federal registration of the mark <unk> . In 2005 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia reversed the TTAB 's decision on the grounds of insufficient evidence of disparagement . Subsequent appeals were rejected on the basis of laches , that the Native Americans had pursued their rights in an untimely manner , in other words they were too old . A second case was filed with younger plaintiffs led by Amanda Blackhorse . On June 18 , 2014 , the TTAB again voted to cancel the six trademarks held by the team in a two to one decision that held that the term " redskins " is disparaging to a " substantial composite of Native Americans " , and this is demonstrated " by the near complete drop @-@ off in usage of ' redskins ' as a reference to Native Americans beginning in the 1960s . " The TTAB majority held that the NCAI represented about 30 percent of Native Americans during the time in question , which the Board found satisfied the substantial composite test . The TTAB also found that the term " redskin " refers to Native Americans ( rather than having an " independent meaning " as the team sometimes claims ) as shown by the costumes worn by both the cheerleaders and marching band from the 1960s until the 1980s , and the native imagery used on the press guides for many years . 
 Evidence of disparagement include the frequent references to " scalping " made by sportswriters for sixty years when reporting the Redskins loss of a game , and passages from movies made from the 1940s to the 1960s using " redskin " to refer to Native Americans as a savage enemy . A linguistics expert for the team unsuccessfully argued that the name is merely a descriptive term no different than other uses of color to differentiate people by race . 
 Reaction to the TTAB decision has often characterized it as government interference in a private business , or as an improper limitation on freedom of expression , but in fact withdraws the government from the responsibility to regulate the use of the name by anyone . The team retains other rights under common law , but must enforce them without Federal government assistance . 
 On July 8 , 2015 , District Court Judge Lee affirmed the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board , denying the team 's summary judgment motions challenging the constitutionality of the Lanham Act and granted the Blackhorse Defendants ' summary judgment motions , finding that " the evidence before the Court supports the legal conclusion that ... the Redskin Marks consisted of matter that ' may disparage ' a substantial composite of Native Americans . " The decision does not bar the team from using the marks and taking other steps to protect other rights to their brand . On October 30 , 2015 Pro @-@ Football , Inc. filed its appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit . In addition to maintaining the validity of all the arguments rejected by both the TTAB and the first appeal , the team has added a list of names they claim are offensive and racist that have been given trademarks , thus making the cancellation of their marks unequal treatment . 
 In December 2015 , the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the prohibition of " disparaging " trademarks in a separate case involving a similar denial of trademark registration to the Asian @-@ American band The <unk> . The majority opinion stated , in part , that " [ w ] hatever our personal feelings about the mark at issue here , or other disparaging marks , the First Amendment forbids government regulators to deny registration because they find speech likely to offend others . " In April 2016 the USPTO asked the U. S. Supreme Court to review the case .

 While varying somewhat , national opinion polls consistently indicate that a majority of the general public do not advocate a name change : 79 percent ( April 2013 ) , 60 percent ( June 2014 ) , and 71 percent ( September 2014 ) . While yielding overall results similar to national polls , with a majority supporting the team keeping the name , local surveys often ask additional questions . In three polls , although they supported the team name , 59 percent , 56 percent , and 53 percent of DC , Maryland , and Virginia fans also said that the word " redskin " is offensive to Native Americans in at least some contexts . The September 2014 national poll found that 68 percent think the name is not disrespectful of Native Americans , 19 percent say it shows " some " disrespect , and 9 percent say it is " a lot " disrespectful . The 2016 annual NFL poll found significant difference of opinion based upon age and race . Older respondents are opposed to a name change , but those between 18 and 29 are strongly ( 70 % ) in favor of a change . While 77 % of all white fans believe the name should not be changed , only 38 % of African @-@ American and 33 % of Latino fans agree , which is a change since the 2014 poll in which there was little difference between white and non @-@ white opinion .

 However , there are those that question the appropriateness of submitting minority rights to a majority decision . Louis Gray , president of the Tulsa Indian Coalition Against Racism and an Osage Indian : " You wouldn 't [ take a poll ] with any other race . You wouldn 't have African @-@ Americans vote to decide whether or not any sort of racial epithet would be offensive . " 
 The survey most frequently cited by opponents of change as definitive of Native American opinion was performed in 2004 as part of the National Annenberg Election Survey . Among other questions regarding election year issues , respondents who identified themselves as being Native American were asked : " The professional football team in Washington calls itself the Washington Redskins . As a Native American , do you find that name offensive or doesn 't it bother you ? " In response , ninety percent replied that the name did not bother them , while nine percent said that it was offensive , and one percent would not answer . The methods used in this survey and the conclusions that can be drawn from it has been criticized by social scientists , Native American scholars and legal experts for years . In August , 2015 , a memo written by senior researchers at the organization responsible for collecting the data for the survey which made it clear that it should not be taken as an accurate reflection of Native American attitudes at the time . 
 An alternative method to standard opinion polls was used by the Center for Indigenous Peoples Studies at California State University , San Bernardino . A survey was conducted of 400 individuals , with 98 individuals positively identified as Native Americans , finding that 67 % agreed with the statement that " Redskins " is offensive and racist . The response from non @-@ natives was almost the opposite , with 68 % responding that the name is not offensive .

 The Annenberg poll was criticized for only using land lines at a time when they were rare on reservations , so 60 % of the respondents in the new poll were contacted on cell phones , based upon other surveys indicating that 95 % of Native Americans have at least one cell phone per household . When a land @-@ line was answered , there was a request that the youngest adult present respond to the questions ; for cell phones the individual answering the phone completed the survey . 
 The new survey included Alaska and Hawaii , which have large populations of indigenous people ; while the 2004 survey only included the contiguous 48 states . 
 Sample selection : The new survey was part of the routine WaPo opinion survey , in which all are asked “ Do you consider yourself white , black or African American , Asian , Native American , Pacific Islander , mixed race or some other race ? ” Only those that responded that they are 100 % Native American / Alaskan Native were then asked the questions about the Redskins . ( However , 16 % of the sample identified themselves as Hispanic . ) They were also asked if they are enrolled members of a tribe , and if so which one ; 44 % of the respondents said they were tribal members . In addition , zip codes containing a high proportion of tribal or reservation land was targeted . Due to the low percentage of Native Americans in the general population , responses were collected over a five month period , December 16 , 2015 to April 12 , 2016 . 
 New questions included : 
 Participants were asked if they had heard about the debate ; 56 % responded that they had heard " not to much " or " not at all " . 78 % said the debate was either " not too " or " not at all " important . 
 80 % responded that they would not be personally offended if a Non @-@ Native American called them as a " Redskin " . 
 A smaller sample of 340 respondents was asked if the term " redskin " is disrespectful to Native Americans , with 73 % responding " No " . 
 51 % said they are pro football fans , while 48 % were not , a split similar to national polls of all adults . 
 = = = = Methodology = = = = 
 Due to variations between the characteristics of the sample and the population of Native Americans based upon Census data from 2010 , the reported results were based upon statistical weighting of the raw data . The respondents were older ( 274 of the 504 being over 50 ) , more highly educated ( at least some college ) , and more likely to live in the Northeast and North Central regions , compared to Native Americans in the Census . Criticism of the wording of the question " As a Native American , do you find that name offensive or doesn 't it bother you ? " as being confusing was addressed by asking the question again to 43 respondents to check that the same answer was given , which it was by 41 of the 43 . However , the problem critics have with the question is that it is unclear what is being asked given that " do you find the name offensive " is distinct from " or doesn 't it bother you " , the later also being awkwardly worded . Reports of the results by others , such as the Associated Press say Native Americans are " not offended " rather than " not bothered " . 
 = = = = Response to WaPo poll = = = = 
 Dr. Adrienne Keene responded that the poll uses faulty data and methods , such as the continuing problem of self @-@ identification , and the reporting of the results misses the point regarding objections to the name established by social science research and the authentic voices of Native Americans as being about real harms , not individual feelings . The Native American Journalists Association ( <unk> ) issued a statement calling the publication of the poll , and the reporting of its significance , as not only inaccurate and misleading but unethical . " The reporters and editors behind this story must have known that it would be used as justification for the continued use of these harmful , racist mascots . They were either willfully malicious or dangerously naïve in the process and reporting used in this story , and neither is acceptable from any journalistic institution . " While not addressing the <unk> criticism , the WaPo editorial board continues to maintained its prior position that the name is a slur and that they will avoid its use as much as possible . However , one WaPo editor and advocate for change , Robert McCartney , has decide to drop any further protest in light of the poll results . A Los Angeles Times editorial cites the evidence that the name is offensive to many , which the poll does not change given its questionable representation of Native American opinion . 
 = Tropical Storm Bret ( 2011 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Bret was the second named storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season . Bret formed along the southwestern periphery of a weather front north of the Bahamas on July 17 . At first , the storm moved little and gradually strengthened in response to favorable upper @-@ level conditions , reaching peak sustained winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . Steering currents in the area subsequently became better established , and Bret turned toward the northeast only to encounter a substantial increase in vertical wind shear . Despite the shear , the storm maintained a well @-@ defined wind circulation for several days , with intermittent bursts of thunderstorms near its center . By July 22 , Bret had been devoid of strong thunderstorm activity for several hours , prompting the National Hurricane Center to discontinue public advisories when it was located about 375 miles ( 605 km ) north of Bermuda . 
 Since Bret remained over the open Atlantic for most of its existence , its effects on land were limited . While moving little , the storm produced inclement weather and widespread cloudiness over much of the north @-@ central Bahamas . Squalls off the eastern coast of Florida generated rough seas along coastlines , injuring a number of people . Although it stayed well offshore , the storm enhanced tropical moisture over Bermuda , causing beneficial rainfall in dry areas . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In mid @-@ July , 2011 , a broad upper trough dropped southward over the northwest Atlantic , supporting a cold front that extended westward across Bermuda to inland over Georgia . The front produced a large area of light showers to its north , with its westernmost component remaining quasi @-@ stationary over northeastern Florida . On July 16 , a surface low developed along the decaying boundary , just off the coast , generating an area of sporadic convection north of the Bahamas . Although a wind circulation was initially absent and surface pressures were relatively high , the low later became better organized under abating shear conditions . At 2100 UTC on July 17 , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) declared it a tropical depression , after reconnaissance confirmed the presence of a closed circulation center about 100 mi ( 160 km ) northwest of Great Abaco Island . It strengthened into Tropical Storm Bret just three hours later , owing to a quick increase in winds and deep central convection . 
 Situated along a weakness in the subtropical ridge , Bret drifted very slowly southward during the initial stages of its existence . Though traces of dry air approached it from the west , the cyclone continued to strengthen , as prominent bands of deep thunderstorms tightened around it eastern semicircle . Satellite images displayed a disorganized eye @-@ like feature on July 18 , suggesting a rather sharp increase in strength . Indeed , an additional reconnaissance flight into the cyclone found peak surface winds of around 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) , just below hurricane strength . Following its peak , Bret began to accelerate toward the northeast in response to building high pressure in the area . It fluctuated little in intensity for several hours , although a combination of high wind shear and a lack of tropical moisture inhibited further development . By July 19 , the circulation center had become exposed and devoid of deep convection , and the storm weakened to 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) winds upon moving through the increasingly hostile environment . Despite the unfavorable conditions , Bret retained this intensity for the next couple of days as it briefly slowed , with a distinct low @-@ level circulation and a few patches of persistent thunderstorms over its southwestern quadrant . 
 Early on July 20 , the heavily sheared cyclone began to <unk> within the deepening southwesterly wind flow . Over the next day , Bret continued to deteriorate in organization ; however , a brief decline in the upper winds allowed intermittent bursts of convection to redevelop south of the exposed center . Bret eventually weakened to a tropical depression over cool ocean temperatures early on July 22 , once again lacking significant convection while increasing in forward speed . Forecasters at the NHC noted that Bret remained " a maverick tropical cyclone by refusing to dissipate despite experiencing very hostile wind shear conditions , " with ship data indications of prevailing strong winds . By 1500 UTC , however , the circulation had become ill defined , prompting the NHC to declassify Bret as a tropical system about 375 mi ( 605 km ) north of Bermuda . During the next several hours , the remnant low of Bret continued to move northeastward out into the Atlantic , until it dissipated on June 23 .

 = = = Bahamas = = = 
 Upon the formation of a depression , the government of the Bahamas issued a tropical storm watch for northwestern islands of the nation . It was upgraded to a tropical storm warning on July 18 , when the storm showed signs of intensification . Further south , a severe weather warning was in effect for New Providence and Andros Island , and authorities urged small craft operators to secure their vessels . The warnings were discontinued later that day as Bret turned away from the territory . 
 Since it initially moved little , Bret brought prolonged overcast conditions to much of the northern Bahamas , with most of the activity over the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama . An estimated 3 in ( 75 mm ) of precipitation fell in Abaco over the weekend of July 16 – 17 . In addition , a weather station on the island reported gale @-@ force gusting of up to 48 mph ( 77 km / h ) at the height of the storm . The rain led to the cancellation of a local Little League baseball match . Outer rainbands spawned a waterspout that touched down on eastern Paradise Island , accompanied by lightning strikes and torrents . Nevertheless , locals considered the storm 's impact to be generally positive , as its rains aided in alleviating mild drought conditions across the nation . 
 = = = United States and Bermuda = = = 
 Off the coast of Florida , the storm generated rough sea conditions with waves of up to 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 9 m ) ; high surf lightly injured several swimmers and surfers in Brevard County . Strong rip currents swept dozens of people out to sea , but all remained unharmed and were quickly rescued . Additionally , the waves washed ashore venomous jellyfish that stung more than 200 people near coastal beaches . Scattered funnel clouds and waterspouts were reported overseas , though the phenomena dissipated soon thereafter without affecting land . Onshore , Bret 's effects were minimal ; weak morning showers and breezy winds briefly brushed Brevard and Volusia Counties . As the storm lifted out of the area , it drew in a large mass of dry air , limiting chances of much @-@ needed rain to subdue a large wildfire in the Okefenokee Swamp . 
 Light showers from the precursor front skirted Bermuda prior to tropical development , with 24 @-@ hour precipitation totals of no more than 0 @.@ 87 in ( 22 mm ) recorded on the territory . Moisture brought on by the storm from afar enhanced rainfall that ended months of dry conditions in Bermuda ; 1 @.@ 75 in ( 45 mm ) of precipitation fell at L.F. Wade International Airport on July 18 , with an additional 1 @.@ 6 in ( 40 mm ) recorded the next day . Although the rains proved to be mostly beneficial , minor flooding affected some local businesses in poor @-@ drainage areas . 
 = Russian ironclad Petr Veliky = 
 Petr Velikiy ( Russian : <unk> <unk> – Peter the Great ) was an ironclad turret ship built for the Imperial Russian Navy during the 1870s . Her engines and boilers were defective , but were not replaced until 1881 . The ship made a cruise to the Mediterranean after they were installed , and before returning to the Baltic Fleet , where she remained for the rest of her career . She did not , like the rest of the Baltic Fleet , participate in the Russo @-@ Turkish War of 1877 – 1878 . Petr Veliky was deemed obsolete by the late 1890s , but she was not ordered to be converted into a gunnery training ship until 1903 . 
 The Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 slowed her reconstruction , and the ship was not completed until 1908 . She spent most of World War I as a training ship , although she became a depot ship for submarines in 1917 . Petr Veliky was in Helsinki in March 1918 when the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their naval base at Helsinki or have their ships interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over . The ship reached Kronstadt in April 1918 and was hulked on 21 May 1921 . She remained in service with the Soviets , in various secondary roles , until she was finally stricken from the Navy List in 1959 and subsequently scrapped . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Petr Veliky had its genesis in the visit of the American twin @-@ turret monitor USS Miantonomoh to Kronstadt in August 1866 , that inspired Rear Admiral A. A. Popov to submit a preliminary design for a low @-@ freeboard , breastwork monitor with a full suite of sails and masts . He intended the ship to act as a hybrid monitor @-@ cruiser , able to attack enemy shipping and threaten his ports . The design was approved by the Naval Technical Committee ( Russian : <unk> <unk> komitet ) , and a detailed design was prepared by September 1867 . This was reviewed on 20 February 1868 , and the coal supply was ordered to be raised from four to five days ' steaming , which forced the design to be revised to accommodate the extra coal . This modified design was approved on 26 January 1869 by the Committee , but more changes were made even after that . In May Popov proposed to add a small superstructure forward of the breastwork to improve seakeeping and overhanging side armor as used on the monitors during the American Civil War . Both changes were approved on 19 June 1869 although the displacement of the ship had constantly increased from the 7 @,@ 496 long tons ( 7 @,@ 616 t ) of the 1867 design to the 9 @,@ 462 long tons ( 9 @,@ 614 t ) of the June 1869 design . 
 Construction of the ship , now named <unk> ( Cruiser ) , began even before the design was approved , but changes to the design continued to be made . The masts and rigging were deleted , presumably shortly after the loss of the British masted turret ship HMS Captain in a storm on 7 September 1870 , although the exact date is not known . The decision between a ram and telescoping spar torpedoes in the ship 's bow was not made until November 1870 . The visit of the British naval architect Edward Reed in June 1871 prompted changes in the design of the breastwork . It was increased in thickness from 12 inches ( 305 mm ) to 14 inches ( 356 mm ) and extended to the sides of the ship in accordance with suggestions by Reed . <unk> was renamed Petr Veliky on 11 June 1872 , in honor of the bicentennial of Peter the Great 's birth . 
 Petr Veliky was 329 feet 8 inches ( 100 @.@ 5 m ) long at the waterline and 333 feet 8 inches ( 101 @.@ 7 m ) long overall , with a beam of 63 feet 1 inch ( 19 @.@ 2 m ) and a designed draft of 24 feet 9 inches ( 7 @.@ 5 m ) . Her displacement as completed was 10 @,@ 406 long tons ( 10 @,@ 573 t ) , almost 500 long tons ( 508 t ) more than her designed displacement of 9 @,@ 665 long tons ( 9 @,@ 820 t ) . 
 The ship 's hull was subdivided by one centerline longitudinal , nine transverse and two wing watertight bulkheads , and it had a complete double bottom . Petr Veliky had a high metacentric height of 8 feet 8 inches ( 2 @.@ 64 m ) . Although a lively roller , she was considered a passable sea @-@ boat even though water flooded in between the gap between the gun turrets and the deck whenever the sea swept over her forecastle . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Petr Veliky had two three @-@ cylinder horizontal return connecting rod @-@ steam engines , each driving a single propeller . Steam was provided by 12 rectangular boilers with a working pressure of 2 @.@ 45 atm ( 248 kPa ; 36 psi ) . The engines were designed to produce a total of 9 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 6 @,@ 700 kW ) to give the ship a maximum speed of around 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) . The ship carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 213 long tons ( 1 @,@ 232 t ) of coal , which gave her an economical range of 2 @,@ 900 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 400 km ; 3 @,@ 300 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The machinery was built by the Baird Works for the price of 1 @,@ 019 @,@ 000 rubles , but proved to be defective . Inferior metal was used in the boilers and multiple cracks and breaks were found in the piping . Cracks were also found in the engine cylinders that Baird had attempted to patch and then <unk> over . Baird was forced to replace almost all of the piping by May 1877 , but during a new series of sea trials in the following month , the ship only reached 11 @.@ 8 knots ( 21 @.@ 9 km / h ; 13 @.@ 6 mph ) . The funnel was raised by about 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) in an attempt to improve the draft to the boiler and 24 stokers were also added to the ship 's crew during the winter of 1877 – 78 , but neither had much effect . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Four muzzle @-@ loading smoothbore 20 @-@ inch ( 508 mm ) guns , based on the American Rodman design , were originally intended as Petr Veliky 's main armament , but the Russians were impressed by a demonstration of a new Krupp 28 @-@ centimeter ( 11 in ) rifled gun . They bought a few guns directly as well as a production license and an enlarged 12 @-@ inch , 20 @-@ caliber , gun was selected to replace the 20 @-@ inch guns . In order to keep the gun ports as small as possible the hydraulic turret machinery raised and lowered the guns ' trunnions rather than their muzzles . They had a maximum elevation of + 12 @.@ 5 ° and a maximum depression of − 2 @.@ 5 ° . This gave the guns a range of about 5 @,@ 800 yards ( 5 @,@ 300 m ) at maximum elevation . The gun turrets were of the Coles type and weighed 360 long tons ( 370 t ) each . Powered by steam engines they could make a complete 360 ° rotation in one minute , although they had a firing arc of only 310 ° . The guns recoiled into the turrets after firing , which meant that a great deal of powder smoke was released into the turret . To counter this problem , ventilation fans were mounted in the turret roofs . The ship 's machinery filled almost the entire breastwork , which forced the main gun magazines away from the turrets towards the ends of the ship , and that complicated the ammunition resupply arrangements for those guns . While some shells were stored in the breastwork , most were not , and likely would have slowed the ship 's sustained rate of fire in a lengthy engagement . 
 A number of sources , including Gardiner , claim that the ship suffered a number of cracks while firing the guns while ice @-@ bound during the winter of 1877 – 78 , but this incident cannot be confirmed by Russian @-@ language sources . McLaughlin believes that any such incident would have been mentioned if it occurred , as such sources are otherwise quite candid about the ship 's drawbacks . 
 The anti @-@ torpedo boat armament of the Petr Veliky consisted of six four @-@ pounder ( 3 @.@ 4 @-@ inch ( 86 mm ) ) guns , four mounted on the bridge , and two at the stern , and two Palmcrantz one @-@ pounder ( 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) ) Gatling @-@ type machine guns . Two telescoping spar torpedoes were mounted in the bow ; one set at 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) below the waterline and the other at 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) . They did not retract all the way into the hull , the excess length was hinged upwards and fastened to the bow . One spar torpedo was hinged on each side of the ship on a 70 feet ( 21 m ) boom that was extended until it was angled at 90 ° to the ship 's side . Furthermore , two towed Harvey torpedoes were mounted at the rear of the ship . While Petr Veliky was not really maneuverable enough to make full use of these weapons , they were a formidable deterrent to other ships trying to ram . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 Petr Veliky had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron , imported from Charles Cammell & Co. of Sheffield , England , that was intended to extend 3 – 5 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 – 1 @.@ 5 m ) below the waterline at the designed displacement . The belt was 14 inches thick for the middle 160 feet ( 49 m ) of the ship , but reduced , in steps , to 8 inches ( 203 mm ) at the bow and 9 inches ( 229 mm ) at the stern . It was backed by multiple layers of teak and iron , thought to be equivalent of another 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of armor . The breastwork was also 14 inches thick , although the curved portions at the end of the breastwork were Hughes compound armor because very thick plates could not be bent easily . The compound armor consisted of two 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) plates separated by a layer of teak . This type of armor was also used to protect the gun turrets . Outside the breastwork , the ship 's deck was armored with three 1 @-@ inch mild steel plates . The deck protection over the redoubt was either 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) or three inches thick : sources vary . 
 = = Service = = 
 Petr Veliky was built by the state @-@ owned Galernii Island Shipyard in Saint Petersburg . Construction began on 1 June 1869 , although her keel was not laid down until 23 July 1870 . The ship was launched on 27 August 1872 , and entered service with the Baltic Fleet on 14 October 1876 . She cost a then @-@ staggering sum of over five and a half million rubles . Two 9 @-@ inch mortars were fitted on her quarterdeck during the war scare with Britain during the Russo @-@ Turkish War of 1877 – 78 , but they were removed in 1880 without ever having been used in combat . Two frames for launching Whitehead torpedoes were added to the ship 's sides in that same year , but they proved ineffective . 
 Her original machinery proved unsatisfactory and the Baird Works forfeited a payment of 254 @,@ 000 rubles as penalty . The navy began to investigate replacing the ship 's machinery in 1878 , and a contract was finally signed with John Elder & Co . , in Glasgow , Scotland , in October 1880 , based on the Navy 's favorable experience with the company 's construction of the Imperial yacht Livadia . The ship did not reach the Scottish shipyard until 14 July 1881 , and was refitting until February 1882 . New vertical compound steam engines and twelve cylindrical boilers with a working pressure of 70 psi ( 483 kPa ; 5 kgf / cm2 ) replaced the original defective machinery . The spar torpedoes in the bow were replaced by underwater torpedo tubes for Whitehead torpedoes and the ship 's propellers and rudder were also replaced . Her funnel was also reduced back to its original height . On 4 February 1882 Petr Veliky ran her sea trials with her new machinery and reached a speed of 14 @.@ 36 knots ( 26 @.@ 59 km / h ; 16 @.@ 53 mph ) with an engine output of 8 @,@ 296 indicated horsepower ( 6 @,@ 186 kW ) . The new engine and boilers were slightly lighter than their predecessors and the ship now displaced 10 @,@ 105 long tons ( 10 @,@ 267 t ) . 
 Immediately after her sea trials the ship departed Scotland for a Mediterranean cruise . Petr Veliky made port visits at Algiers , Athens , Corfu , Naples , La Spezia and Toulon on her before being recalled . She visited Cadiz , Lisbon , Brest , and Cherbourg before reaching Kronstadt on 12 September . The ship remained in the Baltic Sea for the rest of her career and had her light armament modified several times . During the 1880s her rear 4 @-@ pounder guns were replaced by two 44 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 7 in ) Engstrem guns and two other on her bridge were moved to the roof of the forward turret . Petr Veliky 's boilers replaced in 1892 and by the mid @-@ 1890s the ship mounted two 4 @-@ pounder guns on each turret , six 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) 5 @-@ barrel revolving Hotchkiss guns on the bridge and four 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss guns . 
 Petr Veliky was considered obsolete by the late 1890s and a number of proposals were made to reconstruct her . The most elaborate scheme to raise the turrets 7 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 3 m ) and build a new armored casemate between the turrets and deck with six 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns . The existing 14 and 12 @-@ inch wrought iron armor plates would be replaced by Krupp steel plates 8 inches ( 203 mm ) and 7 inches ( 178 mm ) thick respectively . Despite saving 1 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ 000 t ) by substituting the lighter steel armor for the wrought iron , the ship would have gained 674 long tons ( 685 t ) in displacement and her draft would have increased by about 12 inches . This plan was approved , albeit with a very low priority , and her turrets were removed in October 1898 , but nothing more was done . On 11 June 1903 Admiral F. K. <unk> , director of the Naval Ministry , ordered that she be converted into a gunnery training ship . 
 A new design was approved on 2 February 1904 , although the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg had already begun cutting the ship down to the berth deck . The side armor was removed and an entirely new superstructure was built . The boilers were replaced by twelve fire @-@ tube boilers , ten refurbished ones from the Imperial yacht <unk> Zvezda and two new ones . The new boilers only supplied enough steam to give the engines 5 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 4 @,@ 100 kW ) , although a second funnel had to be added to accommodate their exhaust . Two masts were added with fighting tops . Only the ship 's conning tower was now protected , with 4 inches ( 102 mm ) of armor plate . The armament was almost entirely replaced with four 50 @-@ caliber 8 @-@ inch guns mounted in barbettes on the upper deck , sponsoned out over the sides of the ship , and six 45 @-@ caliber 6 @-@ inch guns were fitted in unarmored casemates on each side of the ship . The ship 's anti @-@ torpedo boat armament now consisted of twelve 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) , four 57 @-@ millimeter ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) , eight 47 @-@ millimeter and two 37 @-@ millimeter guns . 
 The outbreak of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , almost as soon as her design was approved , meant that work on her slowed to a crawl , and did not resume until early 1907 . The ship was completed the following year . As a result of the reconstruction Petr Veliky was now 321 feet 10 inches ( 98 @.@ 09 m ) long overall , with a beam of 62 feet 4 inches ( 19 @.@ 0 m ) and a maximum draft of 26 feet 7 inches ( 8 @.@ 1 m ) . Her displacement was now 9 @,@ 790 long tons ( 9 @,@ 950 t ) , almost 400 long tons ( 406 t ) lighter than her modified displacement of 10 @,@ 105 long tons . Her maximum speed was now 12 @.@ 9 knots ( 23 @.@ 9 km / h ; 14 @.@ 8 mph ) , and she carried 714 long tons ( 725 t ) of coal . This gave a range of 1 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 800 km ; 1 @,@ 700 mi ) . 
 After her completion Petr Veliky was assigned to the Gunnery Training Detachment through 1917 . A number of sources report that she was renamed by the Soviets as <unk> ( Republican ) or Barrikada ( Barricade ) , but this is not confirmed by the post @-@ Cold War sources used by McLaughlin . That year she was assigned as a depot ship for submarines at Kronstadt and later Helsinki . The Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their naval base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have their ships interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over . Petr Veliky reached Kronstadt in April in what became known as the ' Ice Voyage ' . The ship was hulked on 21 May 1921 and used to store mines . She was renamed Blokshiv Nr. 1 on 4 December 1923 and forced aground in shallow water by autumn floods in September 1923 . She was not refloated and repaired until 5 October 1927 . On 1 January 1932 she was renamed to Blokshiv Nr. 4 , and to BSh @-@ 3 on 16 May 1949 , by which time she was being used as a barracks ship at Kronstadt . The ship was stricken on 18 April 1959 and subsequently scrapped . 
 = Action of 22 January 1809 = 
 The Action of 22 January 1809 was a minor naval engagement fought off the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe during the Napoleonic Wars . The action was fought as part of the blockade of Guadeloupe and neighbouring Martinique by a large British Royal Navy squadron , which was seeking to cut the islands off from contact and supplies from France by preventing the passage of shipping from Europe to the islands . The British blockade was part of their preparation for planned invasions during the next year . 
 The French made numerous efforts to supply their colonies during this period , attempting to use fast frigates to bring food and military stores to the Caribbean past the British blockades , but often losing the vessels in the process . One such attempt was made by the French frigate Topaze , despatched from Brest to Cayenne with a large cargo of flour . Driven away from Cayenne by a British expeditionary force that had recently captured the colony , Topaze took refuge under the gun batteries of Guadeloupe . 
 Discovered at anchor off Pointe @-@ Noire on 22 January by the British brig HMS Hazard , Topaze was isolated and attacked by two British frigates , led by Captain Samuel Pechell in HMS Cleopatra . In the ensuing engagement , the British ships outnumbered and overwhelmed their opponent , capturing the ship and her cargo , despite heavy fire from a French gun battery that overlooked the anchorage . The British ships were drawn from a force gathered for the impending invasion of Martinique , which was launched six days after Topaze had been captured and successfully completed in a campaign lasting just over three weeks . 
 = = Background = = 
 By the summer of 1808 , the Napoleonic Wars were five years old and the British Royal Navy — whose success during the 1793 – 1801 French Revolutionary Wars had continued into the new conflict — was dominant at sea . In an effort to restrict French movement and trade , the British fleet actively blockaded French ports , maintaining squadrons of fast frigates and large ships of the line off every important French harbour and smaller warships off less significant anchorages to intercept any vessel that attempted to enter or leave . This strategy was practised across the French Empire , particularly in the West Indies , where lucrative British trade routes were at constant risk from raiding French warships and privateers . As a result , the economies of the French colonies , especially the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe , collapsed and their food stocks , military supplies and morale all began to run low . Messages requesting assistance from France were despatched but many were intercepted by British ships , convincing the Admiralty to order invasions of the French colonies . During late 1808 and early 1809 therefore , expeditionary forces were sent to occupy the smaller colonies while a major army and naval fleet were assembled on Barbados under Sir Alexander Cochrane in readiness for an attack on Martinique . 
 In France , news of the situation in the West Indies forced the authorities to take action . During the autumn of 1808 , a number of ships were despatched carrying much needed food and military supplies , but several were intercepted , including the frigate Thétis , captured during the Action of 10 November 1808 in the Bay of Biscay . Despite the losses , some ships did reach their destination intact and further supply ships were prepared , including the frigate Topaze , ordered to transport 1 @,@ 100 barrels of flour to Cayenne . The cargo was loaded during late November and early December , the frigate also carrying military supplies and 100 soldiers to augment the Cayenne garrison . The ship , under the command of Captain Pierre @-@ Nicolas Lahalle , was only three years old and carried 40 heavy guns . 
 In early December 1808 , Topaze departed Brest and travelled across the Atlantic , encountering the British frigate HMS Loire in the Bay of Biscay . Loire fired on Topaze , but was unable to catch her and , despite minor damage , the French ship was able to reach the Caribbean without further incident . Nearing Cayenne on 13 January 1809 , Lahalle was surprised to see the small British ship HMS Confiance emerge from the harbour and manoeuvre threateningly towards his ship . Realising that Cayenne was in British hands , he turned and sailed northwards , concerned that stronger British forces might be nearby . In fact Confiance was the only British ship in the vicinity and she was severely <unk> , with a crew of just 47 men , including 20 local inhabitants recruited on the spot . The colony had been captured just three days earlier by a combined British and Portuguese expeditionary force under Captain James Lucas Yeo . 
 = = Battle = = 
 With Cayenne under British control , Topaze made all speed for Guadeloupe , Lahalle intending to land his food supplies and reinforcements on French held territory before attempting the return journey to Europe . For nine days Topaze crossed the Caribbean without encountering any British warships , but at 07 : 00 on 22 January she was spotted approaching Guadeloupe from the southwest by the brig HMS Hazard under Captain Hugh Cameron , which was part of a squadron detached from Cochrane 's invasion fleet on Barbados to watch the French islands . Although his lookouts had also sighted a French schooner close inshore , Cameron gave orders for his brig to close with the much larger French frigate instead . Within two hours , Hazard was joined by the frigates HMS Cleopatra under Captain Samuel Pechell and HMS Jason under Captain William Maude . Although both ships were smaller than Topaze , together they held a considerable advantage over the overladen French ship . 
 With Hazard approaching from the northeast , Cleopatra from the southeast and Jason from the south , Lahalle had only one clear route available , eastwards directly towards Guadeloupe . By 11 : 00 , Topaze was 200 yards ( 180 m ) offshore , sheltering in the anchorage off Pointe @-@ Noire , which was protected by a small gun battery manned by soldiers from the island 's garrison . Over the next three and a half hours , the British ships steadily approached the bay , hampered by light winds . The breeze strengthened at 14 : 30 and by 16 : 30 Cleopatra was close enough for Topaze to open fire on her from 25 yards ( 23 m ) . Under fire , Pechell manoeuvered into an advantageous position off Topaze 's bow and began to fire on his opponent , shooting away one of the French ship 's anchors . This caused her to swing with her bow towards the shore and Cleopatra was able to repeatedly rake Lahalle 's ship from close range . 
 Severely damaged , Topaze was unable to effectively respond , the only serious danger to the British ships coming from the battery onshore . By 17 : 10 Jason and Hazard had joined Cleopatra , the brig bombarding the battery while Jason opened fire on the other side of the French ship , causing further damage . Recognising that his situation was hopeless , Lahalle surrendered at 17 : 20 . As the French colours fell , approximately a third of the 430 soldiers and sailors on board Topaze attempted to escape captivity by diving overboard and swimming for the shore . Many drowned , and more were killed when Jason opened fire on the swimmers , although exact losses in the water are unknown . The remainder of the survivors , including Lahalle , totalled almost 300 men and were all made prisoners of war . The badly damaged Topaze was towed out of the bay and taken to a British port for repairs . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Casualties were minimal : none were recorded on Jason and Hazard and none in the French battery on shore . Cleopatra , due to the poor position and accuracy of her opponent , lost only two men killed and one wounded , the most serious damage being to her masts and rigging , which were badly cut up . Losses among the French crew in the engagement were also relatively light , with 12 dead and 14 wounded , although a number of men were killed in their attempt to reach the shore after Topaze had surrendered . The French frigate was badly damaged , particularly in her hull , and required extensive repairs before she was fit for service in the Royal Navy , commissioned under the new name of HMS Alcmene . 
 On 28 January , Cochrane 's fleet at Barbados , including Jason , Cleopatra and Hazard , sailed for Martinique , arriving two days later and conducting successful landings at three points on the island . Within a week , all of the French colony was in British hands except for Fort Desaix , which held out for a further three weeks before surrendering after a heavy bombardment . The following month , a major reinforcement fleet arrived from France but was unable to affect the situation on Martinique and anchored in Îles des Saintes , a small archipelago to the south of Guadeloupe . There they were blockaded and attacked by Cochrane 's squadron and in the ensuing Action of 14 – 17 April 1809 were defeated , with the ship of the line <unk> captured and the remainder driven back to Europe . Two frigates reached Guadeloupe , but both were later captured . Subsequent attempts to resupply Guadeloupe , the only remaining French position in the West Indies , were made during 1809 , and a squadron under Commodore Francois Roquebert managed to capture a British frigate at the Action of 13 December 1809 . However , this force was intercepted by a British blockade squadron near Guadeloupe at the Action of 18 December 1809 and defeated , with two frigates destroyed and two others forced to return to Europe without reaching their destination . Guadeloupe was subsequently invaded in January 1810 and captured , ending direct French interest in the Americas during the Napoleonic Wars . 
 = Samut Prakan radiation accident = 
 A radiation accident occurred in Samut Prakan Province , Thailand in January – February 2000 . The accident happened when an <unk> stored unlicensed cobalt @-@ 60 radiation source was recovered by scrap metal collectors who , together with a scrapyard worker , subsequently dismantled the container , unknowingly exposing themselves and others nearby to ionizing radiation . Over the following weeks , those exposed developed symptoms of radiation sickness and eventually sought medical attention . The Office of Atomic Energy for Peace ( OAEP ) , Thailand 's nuclear regulatory agency , was notified when doctors came to suspect radiation injury , some seventeen days after the initial exposure . The OAEP sent an emergency response team to locate and contain the radiation source , which was estimated to have an activity of 15 @.@ 7 terabecquerels ( 420 Ci ) , and was eventually traced to its owner . Investigations found failure to ensure secure storage of the radiation source to be the root cause of the accident , which resulted in ten people being hospitalized for radiation injury , three of whom died , as well as the potentially significant exposure of 1 @,@ 872 people . 
 = = Background = = 
 Cobalt @-@ 60 ( 60Co ) is a synthetic radioactive isotope of cobalt , with a half @-@ life of 5 @.@ 27 years , and emits highly penetrating gamma rays . It is commonly used as a radiation source for radiotherapy and equipment sterilization in the hospital setting , and has several other industrial uses as well . The device involved in the Samut Prakan accident was a rotational <unk> @-@ 3 teletherapy unit , manufactured by Siemens and imported to Thailand in 1969 . It was licensed for and installed at <unk> Hospital in Bangkok ; the radiation source involved was a replacement installed in 1981 , with an initial radioactive activity of 196 TBq ( 5 @,@ 300 Ci ) . At the time of the accident in 2000 , its activity was estimated to have decayed to 15 @.@ 7 TBq ( 420 Ci ) . 
 The licensing of radioisotopes and nuclear material for import , export , possession and use in Thailand is regulated by the Thai Atomic Energy Commission for Peace and its working body , the Office of Atoms for Peace ( OAP ) , formerly known as the Office of Atomic Energy for Peace ( OAEP ) . In principle , the licensing process would involve annual safety inspections , but due to lack of personnel and resources , such inspections were not always properly done , nor were regulatory and control protocols strictly enforced . 
 The hospital retired the radiotherapy unit in 1994 and acquired a new one from <unk> via its Thai agent <unk> <unk> Electric Company ( KSE ) . The old unit and its 60Co source could not be returned either to its original German manufacturer Siemens , which had stopped producing or servicing them , or to the Canadian supplier <unk> , which was not the original manufacturer . Consequently , the hospital sold the old unit to KSE , which already had another licensed unit in storage . However , neither the hospital nor KSE informed the OAEP of the transfer . In 1996 an OAEP inspection found that KSE had three unlicensed units in its warehouse , which had been licensed for the storage of a single unit in 1988 . 
 KSE 's lease of the warehouse was terminated in 1999 . KSE subsequently returned the licensed unit , while moving the three unregistered units to an unused car park in Bangkok 's <unk> District , which was owned by its parent company . The car park was fenced , but the fence had been breached and nearby residents regularly entered to play football in its empty areas . KSE notified the OAEP of its transfer of the licensed unit , but did not mention the other three , which remained orphan sources . 
 = = Accident = = 
 On 24 January 2000 , the part of the radiation therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors , who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale . They took it home , planning to dismantle it later . On 1 February , the two , together with another two associates , attempted to dismantle the metal part ( a 97 @-@ kilogram , 42 @-@ by @-@ 20 @-@ centimetre lead cylinder held in a stainless steel casing ) , which was the unit 's source drawer . Using a hammer and chisel , they only managed to crack the welded seam . Two of the men then took the metal piece , along with other scrap metal , to a scrapyard on Soi Wat <unk> in Phra <unk> District , Samut Prakan Province . There they asked a worker at the scrapyard to cut open the cylinder using an oxyacetylene torch . As the cylinder was cut open , two smaller cylindrical metal pieces , which had held the source capsule , fell out . The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the scrapyard , but was unaware of the source capsule itself . The lead cylinder was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the disassembly . 
 That same day , the four men present when the cylinder was opened ( two of the scrap collectors and two scrapyard employees ) began to feel ill , experiencing headaches , nausea and vomiting . The scrap collectors succeeded in taking the lead cylinder apart , and took the parts to sell at the scrapyard the next day . The scrapyard employees continued to feel sick during the following week , and on 12 February the scrapyard owner , believing the metal to be causing the illness , asked the scrap collector to take it elsewhere , and had the two smaller metal pieces thrown away . 
 By mid @-@ February the symptoms of those involved were deteriorating ; their symptoms included burn wounds , swollen hands , diarrhoea , fever , and hair loss . One of the scrap collectors went to Samut Prakan Hospital on 15 February and was admitted the next day , while the two scrapyard employees were also admitted , on 16 and 17 February . The scrapyard owner 's husband was admitted to Bangkok General Hospital on 17 February due to epistaxis ( nosebleed ) , while the scrapyard owner , her mother , and her maid ( all of whom lived across the street from the scrapyard and sometimes entered ) also began to feel ill . A stray dog that was often seen in the scrapyard also died . 
 Two of the patients at Samut Prakan Hospital were admitted to the surgical ward , while the other was admitted to the medical ward . All were nauseated and vomiting , and two of them were showing leukopenia ( low white blood cell count ) . Reviewing the cases on 18 February , the doctors realized their symptoms were likely caused by radiation exposure , and notified the OAEP . 
 = = Response = = 
 Upon receiving notification , the OAEP sent two officers to investigate , who met the doctors and patients at the hospital shortly after noon on 18 February . After questioning the scrapyard owner , they searched for the cylindrical metal pieces initially suspected to be the radiation source , but found that they were not radioactive . They then headed to the scrapyard , and noted abnormally high levels of radiation as they approached , late in the evening . At the scrapyard entrance they measured radiation at an equivalent dose of 1 millisievert per hour ( mSv / h ) and decided to request additional assistance . 
 Recognizing the event as a serious radiological accident , the OAEP organized an emergency response team to manage the situation , in conjunction with the local public health and civil defense authorities . They conducted contamination and radiation level surveys and found that there was no contamination , but the radiation dose rate was as high as 10 mSv / h near the source , which kept them from getting close enough to determine what the source was . Surveys to locate the source continued throughout the night . The scrapyard and immediate vicinity were cordoned off , but evacuation was deemed unnecessary . 
 Retrieval operations began in the afternoon of the following day ( 19 February 2000 ) , after planning and rehearsing . An excavator was used to clear the way into the scrapyard , and a lead wall was placed to help shield operators from radiation . Scrap metal pieces near the source were removed one by one , using a grasping tool for large pieces , and an improvised electromagnet attached to a 5 @-@ metre ( 16 ft ) bamboo rod for smaller ones . A high range radiation dose rate probe was used to screen these metal pieces for radioactivity . A fluorescent screen was used to ultimately determine the exact location of the source , but the team had to wait for cloud cover to reduce moonlight enough to see properly . The source capsule was finally retrieved shortly after midnight and placed in a shielded container . It was identified by in situ gamma spectroscopy as 60Co , and had an estimated activity of 15 @.@ 7 terabecquerels ( 420 Ci ) . 
 The 60Co source was transferred for storage at the OAEP headquarters . Subsequent surveys found radiation in the scrapyard to have returned to normal background levels . During the same time , the OAEP was informed of the three teletherapy units in the car park , and a separate investigating team found one of the units to have had its drawer assembly missing . This was confirmed to be the origin of the source , and the three units were removed for temporary storage on 21 February . 
 The OAEP reported the incident to the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , which sent a team of experts on 26 February to assist in the management of the situation and the treatment of those injured . 
 = = Casualties = = 
 In total , ten people were admitted to hospital with radiation sickness : the four scrap collectors , the two scrapyard employees , the scrapyard owner , her husband , her mother , and her maid . Of these , four people ( those working at the scrapyard ) were estimated to have received radiation doses of over 6 gray ( Gy ) . All patients were ultimately referred to <unk> Hospital , where they received inpatient care . All but one of the patients developed <unk> or <unk> ( depletion of white blood cells and / or platelets ) . Several also developed burns , and one ( the first scrap collector ) had to have his finger amputated . Three patients ( the two scrapyard workers and the owner 's husband ) ultimately died of uncontrolled infection and sepsis , all within two months of exposure . 
 In addition to these casualties , 1 @,@ 872 people living within 100 metres ( 330 ft ) of the scrapyard were potentially exposed to different levels of ionizing radiation . Physical exams and blood tests were provided to nearly half these people , who sought medical attention . Radiation doses received by OAEP personnel working to recover the radiation source did not exceed 32 mSv , as measured by individual thermoluminescent dosimeters . 
 = = Public reaction and aftermath = = 
 The accident became a subject of intense news coverage . The origin of the poorly stored radioactive source was traced to KSE , which was charged with possessing radioactive substances without permission and was fined 15 @,@ 000 baht ( approx $ 450 ) . Environmental Litigation and Advocacy for the Wants ( <unk> ) , a non @-@ governmental advocacy group , later filed a class action lawsuit against KSE on behalf of the victims , and also against the OAEP in the Administrative Court . The Administrative Court later ruled in 2003 in favour of the plaintiffs , ordering the OAEP to pay 5 @,@ 222 @,@ 301 baht ( approx $ 155 @,@ 000 ) as restitution . KSE was ordered by the Civil Court to pay a total of 640 @,@ 246 baht ( approx $ 19 @,@ 000 ) . 
 In media reports of the accident , several reporters commented negatively on the emergency response team 's operation , perceiving them as " not taking the matter [ of radiation hazard ] seriously " and being unprofessional and lacking training . The BBC told of " officials searching through scrap metal heaps for radioactive waste using sticks and wearing cotton gardening gloves and cloth face @-@ masks . " The IAEA defended the team in its report , noting that it included " experienced personnel with expertise in dealing with high radiation fields and control of known contamination , " and that they " used innovative means to achieve rapid recovery of the source . " It also commented that the lead aprons worn by some members of the response team were not appropriate for use in the situation , as they would not offer adequate protection against ionizing radiation . 
 As public concern over the accident grew while information and education was limited , misconceptions arose about the nature of radiation hazards . Residents near a Buddhist temple protested and prevented the cremation of one of the victims , believing that the body could spread radiation , despite assurances by the OAEP to the contrary . 
 The IAEA report noted that the main contributing factors to the accident were : difficulties in the disposal of radiation sources , the OAEP 's limited oversight capacity , transfer of the disused source without the OAEP 's approval , moving the sources to an unsecured location , lack of understandable warnings , and the dismantling of the device . An article published in Australasian Physical & Engineering Sciences in Medicine commented that " the most serious omission occurred when the medical users ... returned the obsolete units to the Medical Dealer without notifying the OAEP " and that their insecure storage " invited theft . " It called for provisions for the safe return and verified disposal of all significant radioactive sources , and stated : " National action is needed to cope with the regulatory problem of orphan sources by maintaining accountability of sources through national registers and the legal enforcement of compliance with the regulations . " 
 The accident , along with other similar events , prompted the IAEA to re @-@ evaluate the effectiveness of the radioactive hazard trefoil as a warning symbol . Although the symbol was displayed on the teletherapy head , none of those handling the device were aware of its meaning , nor were there written warnings in Thai . Together with the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) , the IAEA developed a new symbol that would serve as an intuitive warning for large sources of ionizing radiation . The new symbol was published in 2007 as ISO <unk> , and is intended to accompany the trefoil on internal components of devices containing dangerous sources to prevent persons from unknowingly disassembling them . 
 In Thailand , however , substantial efforts to prevent further such occurrences had not materialized in the months following the accident . Labour activists , trade unions and workers were lobbying for the creation of an independent occupational health and safety institute . Social critics pointed out that the accident , along with several prior disasters such as the Kader toy factory fire , was part of a trend in which the country 's rapid industrialization resulted in increasing health and environmental hazards due to poor regulations and lack of official willingness to tackle the issue . 
 Similar incidents occurred in Thailand in 2008 , without injuries . In June 2008 , a cesium @-@ 137 sealed radioactive source was found among scrap metal sold to a scrap dealer in Ayutthaya Province . The dealer recognized the trefoil symbol , and notified the OAP , which responded and found no leak of radiation or contamination . It could not , however , determine the origins of the equipment . In August , a recycling factory in <unk> Province notified the OAP after a piece of scrap metal set off its gate detector alarm . The OAP found that the piece of metal contained radium @-@ 226 sources , and concluded that it originated from unlicensed use in a lightning preventer . 
 = Bengal slow loris = 
 The Bengal slow loris ( Nycticebus bengalensis ) or northern slow loris is a strepsirrhine primate and a species of slow loris native to the Indian subcontinent and Indochina . Its geographic range is larger than that of any other slow loris species . Considered a subspecies of the Sunda slow loris ( N. coucang ) until 2001 , phylogenetic analysis suggests that the Bengal slow loris is most closely related to the Sunda slow loris . However , some individuals in both species have mitochondrial DNA sequences that resemble those of the other species , due to introgressive hybridization . It is the largest species of slow loris , measuring 26 to 38 cm ( 10 to 15 in ) from head to tail and weighing between 1 and 2 @.@ 1 kg ( 2 @.@ 2 and 4 @.@ 6 lb ) . Like other slow lorises , it has a wet nose ( rhinarium ) , a round head , flat face , large eyes , small ears , a vestigial tail , and dense , woolly fur . The toxin it secretes from its brachial gland ( a scent gland in its arm ) differs chemically from that of other slow loris species and may be used to communicate information about sex , age , health , and social status . 
 The Bengal slow loris is nocturnal and arboreal , occurring in both evergreen and deciduous forests . It prefers rainforests with dense canopies , and its presence in its native habitat indicates a healthy ecosystem . It is a seed disperser and pollinator , as well as a prey item for carnivores . Its diet primarily consists of fruit , but also includes insects , tree gum , snails , and small vertebrates . In winter , it relies on plant exudates , such as sap and tree gum . The species lives in small family groups , marks its territory with urine , and sleeps during the day by curling up in dense vegetation or in tree holes . It is a seasonal breeder , reproducing once every 12 – 18 months and usually giving birth to a single offspring . For the first three months , mothers carry their offspring , which reach sexual maturity at around 20 months . The Bengal slow loris can live up to 20 years . 
 The species is listed as " Vulnerable " on the IUCN Red List , and is threatened with extinction due to a growing demand in the exotic pet trade and traditional medicine . It is one of the most common animals sold in local animal markets . In traditional medicine , it is primarily used by wealthy to middle @-@ class , urban women following childbirth , but also to treat stomach problems , broken bones , and sexually transmitted diseases . It is also hunted for food and suffers from habitat loss . Wild populations have declined severely , and it is locally extinct in several regions . It is found within many protected areas throughout its range , but this does not protect them from rampant poaching and illegal logging . Critical conservation issues for this species include enhancing protection measures , stricter enforcement of wildlife protection laws , and increased connectivity between fragmented protected areas . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 Nycticebus bengalensis , commonly known as the Bengal slow loris or northern slow loris , is a strepsirrhine primate in the slow loris genus , Nycticebus . Formerly considered a subspecies of the Sunda slow loris ( N. coucang ) , it was recognized as a distinct species in 2001 by taxonomist and primatologist Colin Groves . It is difficult to distinguish from the other species in its genus . 
 To help clarify species and subspecies boundaries , and to establish whether morphology @-@ based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships , the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Nycticebus have been investigated using DNA sequences derived from the mitochondrial markers D loop and cytochrome b . Although most of the recognized lineages of Nycticebus ( including N. pygmaeus , N. menagensis and N. javanicus ) were shown to be genetically distinct — the analysis suggested that DNA sequences from some individuals of N. coucang and N. bengalensis apparently share a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than with members of their own species . The authors suggest that this result may be explained by introgressive hybridization , as the tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of sympatry in southern Thailand ; the precise origin of one of the N. coucang individuals was not known . This hypothesis was corroborated by a 2007 study that compared the variations in mitochondrial DNA sequences between N. bengalensis and N. coucang , and suggested that there has been gene flow between the two species . 
 = = Anatomy and physiology = = 
 The Bengal slow loris is the largest species of slow loris , weighing 1 to 2 @.@ 1 kg ( 2 @.@ 2 to 4 @.@ 6 lb ) , and measuring between 26 and 38 cm ( 10 and 15 in ) from head to tail . It has a skull length of more than 62 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) . It has dense , woolly , brown @-@ gray fur on its back and white fur on its underside . It also has a clear dark stripe that runs up to the top of its head , but does not extend laterally towards the ears . Its forearm and hand are almost white . The limbs of the pelvis vary in color from brown to nearly white , and the feet are always pale . Moulting may cause seasonal variations in the color of the dorsal surface . Like other slow lorises , its tail is vestigial and it has a round head and short ears . It has a rhinarium ( the moist , naked surface around the nostrils of the nose ) and a broad , flat face with large eyes . Its eyes reflect a bright orange eye shine . On its front feet , the second digit is smaller than the rest ; the big toe on its hind foot opposes the other toes , which enhances its gripping power . Its second toe on the hind foot has a curved " toilet @-@ claw " that the animal uses for scratching and grooming , while the other nails are straight . 
 In addition to being smaller than the Bengal slow loris , the sympatric Sunda slow loris also differs in its coloring : it does not have the pale areas of the head , nape and shoulders , and its overall color is a <unk> or golden @-@ brown . The pygmy slow loris ( N. pygmaeus ) is much smaller , with a skull length less than 55 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) . It also lacks the dark dorsal stripe of the Bengal slow loris , has dark brown fur , and longer ears . 
 The Bengal slow loris has a small swelling on the ventral side of its elbow called the brachial gland , which secretes a pungent , clear oily toxin that the animal uses defensively by wiping it on its toothcomb . The oil has been analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry , and it has been shown that almost half of the several dozen volatile or semi @-@ volatile chemicals present do not occur in the closely related pygmy slow loris . The most predominant component was the phenolic compound m @-@ <unk> . The authors of the study suggest that the chemically complex oils may help the lorises communicate with each other , allowing them to transmit by scent information about sex , age , health and nutritional status , and dominance . 
 = = Behavior and ecology = = 
 The preferred habitats of the Bengal slow loris range across tropical and subtropical regions , and include evergreen and semi @-@ evergreen rainforests with forest edges and continuous , dense canopies . It can also be found in bamboo groves . It prefers habitats with larger diameter , tall trees with a large crown depth ( defined as the length along the main axis from the tree tip to the base of the crown ) ; these areas are typically associated with greater food abundance , and decreased risk of predation . Because of its preference for dense forests , it acts as a good indicator of the ecosystem 's health . 
 The species acts as an important seed disperser and pollinator , as well as a prey item for several carnivores . The Bengal slow loris feeds on plant exudates such as sap , gums , resins , and <unk> , particularly those from the family Fabaceae . Even though the species does not have keeled nails , it will scrape the plant , actively breaking its surface ; this behavior resembles that of marmosets and the fork @-@ marked lemurs . <unk> are also obtained by gouging holes in the bark . The winter food supply consists almost entirely of plant exudates . The bastard <unk> ( Terminalia <unk> ) , a deciduous tree common in Southeast Asia , is a preferred source for exudates , but it has also been observed taking plant exudates from a number of families : Moraceae ( Artocarpus ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , Fabaceae ( Acacia , Bauhinia ) , <unk> ( <unk> arborea ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) . Although it will feed on large insects ( such as katydids and crickets ) , gum , snails , small birds , and reptiles , it is primarily frugivorous . Lianas of the flowering plant genus Bauhinia are a commonly used food source . 
 A nocturnal animal , the Bengal slow loris has excellent night vision , enhanced by a tapetum lucidum — a layer of tissue in the eye that reflects visible light back through the retina . It sleeps during the day curled up in a ball in dense vegetation or in tree holes . Males and females mark their territory with urine . The species is known to live in small family groups . Animals may practice social grooming . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 The Bengal slow loris is not a seasonal breeder , unlike the pygmy slow loris . Females in an estrous cycle attract males with a loud whistle . Females reproduce every 12 – 18 months and have a six @-@ month gestation . Because they are not seasonal breeders , females could become pregnant when their offspring are approximately 6 months old , making possible for females to produce two offspring per year . Females typically give birth to a single offspring , although twins rarely occur . This differs from the sympatric pygmy slow loris , which commonly has twins . The mother carries her young about three months before they become independent , although they may be temporarily left on branches while the mother searches for food . Sexual maturity is reached at approximately 20 months of age . The species is known to live up to 20 years . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 The species has the largest geographic range of all slow loris species and is native to Northeast India , Bangladesh and Indochina ( Cambodia , Laos , Burma , Vietnam , southern China and Thailand ) . It is the only nocturnal primate found in the northeast Indian states , which include Assam , Arunachal Pradesh , Mizoram , Nagaland , Meghalaya , Manipur and Tripura . It is found in parts of Yunnan and in southwest Guangxi in China , and has been recorded in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh . It is known from 24 protected areas in Vietnam , and is distributed across most of Thailand . In Burma , it has been reported from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Chin Hills , <unk> , <unk> and Pegu ; populations in Laos have been recorded in the north , central , and southern portions of the country . 
 The Bengal slow loris is sympatric ( shares its range ) with the pygmy slow loris in southeast of China , Vietnam , and Laos . The Bengal slow loris is also sympatric with the Sunda slow loris on the southern peninsula of Thailand . In 2001 , Groves reported the existence of hybrids between these two species in this region . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 Listed as " Data Deficient " as recently as 2006 on the IUCN Red List , The Bengal slow loris was evaluated in 2008 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) as " Vulnerable " — a decision based solely on habitat loss due to lack of sufficient field data . It is found within numerous protected areas within its range ; however , poaching and illegal logging are rampant while conservation measures are not species @-@ specific . The species can be found in at least 43 protected areas in Northeast India , 14 conservation areas in Laos , and 24 protected areas in Vietnam . It can be found at <unk> National Park in Bangladesh , and 80 % of its range in China is protected . The species has been listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 , and in June 2007 , it was transferred along with all other slow loris species to CITES Appendix I , which forbids international commercial trade . 
 The most severe threats facing the species are the wildlife trade ( trapping for exotic pets and use in traditional medicine ) and deforestation . Slash and burn agriculture has also resulted in the destruction of its habitat , and road construction is another factor in its decline . Hunting has been found to be most severe when nearby urban human populations increase . Enhancing protection measures , enforcing current wildlife protection laws , and improving the connectivity between protected areas are factors considered critical to ensure the survival of this species . 
 The species is commonly sold as a pet and to zoos throughout Southeast Asia . In Cambodia , it was reported in 2006 as one of the most common mammals found in shops and stalls , found in the hundreds and selling for US $ 0 @.@ 85 to US $ 6 @.@ 25 . In the same year , it was found selling for US $ 2 @.@ 50 to US $ 6 @.@ 30 at bazaars in China ( <unk> County in Yunnan Province ) and US $ 70 in Thailand . The Bengal slow loris is used in traditional medicine in all of these countries , selling for US $ 15 in Vietnam , and is also eaten in Vietnam . The animal is predominantly used to prepare treatments for women after childbirth , stomach problems , healing wounds and broken bones , and in the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases . Primary users are wealthy to middle @-@ class women in urban areas . 
 = = = Habitat and population trends = = = 
 Throughout its geographic range , slow lorises are in serious decline . Their habitat has been seriously degraded , and growing human populations will add increasing pressure . In countries like Bangladesh , only 9 % of the original forest cover was still present in 2000 . In northeastern Cambodia , forests are being cleared at an increasing rate , with a loss of 6 % of the natural forest between 1999 and 2000 . Within those same years , Myanmar and Thailand lost 14 % and 26 % of their natural forest , respectively . In Vietnam , only 30 % of the original forest cover remains due to the deforestation caused by the Vietnam War , and only 10 % of that includes closed @-@ canopy forests . Habitat destruction remains rampant , and all slow loris populations within its borders are significantly depleted . Populations have been declared locally extinct in southern Quảng Nam Province and parts of the highlands , and the same is expected in Song Thanh and Kon Cha Rang nature reserves . 
 In India , dense forest canopy has been depleted by as much as 55 % in some areas and is rapidly disappearing . As early as 1987 , the Indo @-@ China region had reportedly lost 75 % of the natural habitat for slow lorises . In 1992 , the population size was estimated between 16 @,@ 000 and 17 @,@ 000 individuals , based on available habitat ; however , recent publications report that few individuals remain due a reduced geographic range . The Bengal slow loris may be restricted to a few isolated populations and is in serious threat of becoming locally extinct in parts of Assam and Meghalaya . In Arunachal Pradesh , its population is declining and under threat . 
 Population density has been estimated between 0 @.@ 03 and 0 @.@ 33 individuals per km2 in Assam , India according to a study published in 2006 .

 Since the 1990s , China 's forests have declined significantly . In Yunnan and Guangxi provinces , primary forests are few and isolated , and secondary forests have been severely degraded . Yunnan has lost 42 % of its forests and 2 @,@ 000 or less slow lorises remain . In Guangxi , the Bengal slow loris is nearly extinct ; it has been extirpated in <unk> County and only a few individuals are left in Jingxi , <unk> and <unk> . 
 = SMS Hagen = 
 SMS Hagen was the final vessel of the six @-@ member Siegfried class of coastal defense ships ( Küstenpanzerschiffe ) built for the German Imperial Navy . Her sister ships were Siegfried , Beowulf , Frithjof , Heimdall , and Hildebrand . Hagen was built by the Kaiserliche Werft Kiel shipyard between 1891 and 1893 , and was armed with a main battery of three 24 @-@ centimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns . She served in the German fleet throughout the 1890s and was rebuilt in 1900 - 1902 . She served in the VI Battle Squadron after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , but saw no action . Hagen was demobilized in 1915 and used as a barracks ship thereafter . She was ultimately sold for scrap in 1919 and subsequently dismantled . 
 = = Design = = 
 Hagen was 79 meters ( 259 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 14 @.@ 90 m ( 48 @.@ 9 ft ) and a maximum draft of 5 @.@ 74 m ( 18 @.@ 8 ft ) . She displaced 3 @,@ 741 long tons ( 3 @,@ 801 t ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two vertical 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines . Steam for the engines was provided by four coal @-@ fired boilers . The ship 's propulsion system provided a top speed of 14 @.@ 8 knots ( 27 @.@ 4 km / h ; 17 @.@ 0 mph ) and a range of approximately 1 @,@ 490 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 760 km ; 1 @,@ 710 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Hagen had a crew of 20 officers and 256 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with three 24 cm K L / 35 guns mounted in three single gun turrets . Two were placed side by side forward , and the third was located aft of the main superstructure . They were supplied with a total of 204 rounds of ammunition . The ship was also equipped with eight 8 @.@ 8 cm SK L / 30 guns in single mounts . Hagen also carried four 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes , all in swivel mounts on the deck . One was at the bow , another at the stern , and two amidships . The ship was protected by an armored belt that was 240 mm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) amidships , and an armored deck that was 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick . The conning tower had 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick sides . Hagen 's armor consisted of new Krupp steel , a more effective type of armor than the compound steel the other members of the class received . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Hagen was laid down in 1891 at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel . She was launched on 23 October 1893 , and completed on 2 October 1894 . In July 1895 , Hagen , the protected cruiser Kaiserin Augusta , and the old corvettes Marie and Stosch were sent to Morocco in a naval demonstration following the murder of two German nationals in the country . The German government had demanded 250 @,@ 000 marks as an indemnity , and the naval squadron was sent to secure it . 
 After returning to Germany , Hagen served on active duty with the fleet . In 1897 , Hagen participated in the annual summer maneuvers in the IV Division , along with Heimdall and Frithjof . Her other three sisters were assigned to the III Division . The following year , she was taken into drydock at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Danzig for an extensive reconstruction . The ship was lengthened to 86 @.@ 13 m ( 282 @.@ 6 ft ) , which increased displacement to 4 @,@ 247 t ( 4 @,@ 180 long tons ; 4 @,@ 682 short tons ) . Her old boilers were replaced with eight new Thornycroft boilers , and a second funnel was added . Her secondary battery was increased to ten 8 @.@ 8 cm guns , and the 35 cm torpedo tubes were replaced with three 45 cm ( 18 in ) tubes . Work was completed by 1900 . 
 She then returned to service with the fleet , where in 1903 she was in the II Squadron , alongside Beowulf , Heimdall , and Hildebrand . She remained on active service until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , when she was mobilized into the VI Battle Squadron for coastal defense , along with her sister ships . On 31 August 1915 , the VI Battle Squadron was demobilized , and Hagen 's crew was transferred to other warships . She was then used as a barracks ship in Libau , Danzig , and Warnemünde . On 17 June 1919 , she was stricken from the naval register . She was sold for scrapping to Norddeutsche Tiefbaugesellschaft of Berlin and broken for scrap . 
 = Mother Simpson = 
 " Mother Simpson " is the eighth episode of The Simpsons ' seventh season . It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 19 , 1995 . After faking his own death to get a day off of work , Homer reunites with his mother Mona , whom he thought had died 27 years ago . It was directed by David Silverman and was the first episode to be written by Richard Appel . Glenn Close makes her first of six guest spots as Homer 's mother . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Mr. Burns has all of his employees clean up a highway maintained by his company . Not wishing to waste his Saturday , Homer fakes his death so that he does not have to take part . He uses a replica of himself and throws it into a waterfall which gets severely broken and eventually goes into the turbines to which everyone thinks Homer killed himself . The next day , news of Homer 's " death " spreads , and after getting many flowers and sympathy cards , as well as a tombstone , Marge finds out and orders Homer to go to the Springfield Hall of Records to get the " misunderstanding " sorted out . While sorting out the problem , Homer gets into an argument with a clerk who claims that Homer 's mother is still alive , in spite of Homer 's belief that she died while he was young . Homer visits what he believes is her grave , only to discover that it belongs to Walt Whitman . Nearby , he sees his own grave and falls into it . A woman approaches and chastises Homer for falling into her son 's grave . Homer realizes that the woman is his mother , Mona , and the two have an emotional reunion after 27 years apart . 
 Homer takes Mona home to meet the family and she bonds with Lisa , being on the same intellectual level . While the two are sitting on the front steps , a police car drives by and Mona runs inside the house , making Lisa suspicious . She shares her suspicions with Bart , who had raided Mona 's purse and found several driver 's licenses with different names ; Lisa suspects that Mona is a con artist . Meanwhile , Homer and Marge are wondering why his mother left him for 27 years and the two decide to confront Mona , who decides to tell them the truth . 
 In a flashback to 1969 , Mona is a housewife who still lives with Homer 's father Abe . While Abe is watching the 1969 Super Bowl , Mona becomes inspired by Joe Namath 's long hair . She joins a group of hippies who protest Mr. Burns ' germ warfare laboratory , who is deliberately trying to poison everyone in Springfield . They detonate an " antibiotic bomb " inside the lab , killing all the germs and curing lab security guard Clancy Wiggum 's asthma . Angry about the destruction of his " precious germs " , Burns runs to the lab , but is trampled by the fleeing hippies . Mona goes back to help him , and Burns manages to identify her as one of the perpetrators , forcing Mona to leave her family and go into hiding . 
 Mona reveals that she sent Homer a care package every week , although he never received them , and they go to the post office to claim them . There , Burns recognizes her and calls the FBI . The FBI and Burns manage to track Mona down and invade the Simpson home . However , Homer and Mona manage to escape thanks to a tip @-@ off from Wiggum , who is grateful to Mona for curing his asthma , and thereby allowing him to join the police force . Mona is once again forced to go into hiding and she and Homer say goodbye . After Mona leaves , Homer remains well into the night , sitting on his car and watching the stars . 
 = = Production = = 
 The idea for " Mother Simpson " was pitched by Richard Appel , who decided to do something about Homer 's mother , who previously had only been mentioned once . Many of the writers could not believe that an episode about Homer 's mother had not previously been produced . Part of the fun of an episode about Homer 's mother for the writers was that they were able to solve several little puzzles , such as where Lisa 's intelligence came from . The ending shot with Homer gazing at the sky was decided at the table read , but the drawing at the end was inserted by David Silverman because it was felt that the scene was so touching that no other lines were needed . As a result , no promos were aired over the credits during the original airing of the episode . Bill Oakley has admitted that he always gets teary @-@ eyed when he watches the ending . 
 Glenn Close , who was directed by Josh Weinstein , was convinced to do the episode partially because of James L. Brooks . Mona Simpson was designed in a way so that she would somewhat resemble Homer in her face , such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose . There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman , but still be Simpson @-@ esque . The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground , although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description . Mona Simpson 's crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could think of , as she did not harm anyone and was only caught because she came back to help Mr. Burns . The character was named after Richard Appel 's wife at the time , the novelist Mona Simpson . When Mona gets in the van , her voice is done by Pamela Hayden because Glenn Close could not say " d 'oh ! " properly and thus they used the original temp track recorded by Hayden . 
 The design of Joe Friday is based on his design in " Dragged Net ! " , a parody of Dragnet that was done in Mad Magazine in the 1950s . Mona becoming a radical after seeing Joe Namath 's sideburns is a parody of how many 1960s films have a sudden transformational moment and play music such as " Turn ! Turn ! Turn ! " and there was much discussion among the writers as to what that moment should be . The song originally intended to be taped over Mr. Burns ' cassette of " Ride of the Valkyries " was " Wake Me Up Before You Go @-@ Go " , but it was too expensive to clear , so ABBA ’ s " Waterloo " was selected instead . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 " Mother Simpson " draws upon a number of references to 1960s popular culture . Three songs from the 1960s appear in this episode : " Sunshine of Your Love " by Cream , " Blowin ' in the Wind " by Bob Dylan and the Jimi Hendrix cover of " All Along the Watchtower " . Mona Simpson is seen reading Steal This Book by Abbie Hoffman . Mona mentions that she worked a number of jobs while on the run , including " marketing Jerry Rubin ’ s line of diet shakes , proofreading Bobby Seale ’ s cookbook , and running credit checks at Tom Hayden ’ s Porsche dealership . " Rubin , Seale and Hayden were three liberal radicals from the 1960s . Rubin did indeed have a line of diet shakes , and Bobby Seale did write some cookbooks . However , Tom Hayden never owned a Porsche dealership . 
 The radicals use a Spiro Agnew alarm clock , which is based on a real item . When Mr. Burns drives a tank towards the Simpson house , he is wearing oversized headgear . This is a reference to a public relations stunt by Michael Dukakis in 1988 . When Mr. Burns plays a tape of " Ride of the Valkyries " , it has been recorded over by Smithers with " Waterloo " by ABBA , a reference to Smithers ' implied homosexuality ( ABBA are gay icons ) and to the helicopter beach attack scene in Apocalypse Now , in which " Ride of the Valkyries " is famously played . Maggie is shown dancing in her diaper and covered in slogans in a parody of the filler scenes of Laugh @-@ In in which Goldie Hawn and other female cast members like Ruth <unk> and Jo Anne Worley danced in a bikini with slogans and drawings painted on their bodies . The two FBI agents are Joe Friday and Bill Gannon from Dragnet . Bill Gannon is voiced by Harry Morgan , the man who played Gannon in the original series .

 In its original broadcast , " Mother Simpson " finished 45th in ratings for the week of October 30 - November 5 , 1995 , with a Nielsen rating of 10 @.@ 0 , equivalent to approximately 9 @.@ 6 million viewing households . It was the fourth highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , following Beverly Hills , 90210 , The X @-@ Files and Melrose Place . 
 " Mother Simpson " is one of Oakley and Weinstein 's favorite episodes ; they have called it a perfect combination of real emotion , good jokes and an interesting story . In 1996 , " Treehouse of Horror VI " was submitted for the Emmy Award in the " Outstanding Animated Program ( For Programming less than One Hour ) " category because it had a 3D animation sequence , which they felt would have given it the edge . Pinky and the Brain eventually went on to win . Bill Oakley feels that had this episode been submitted , it would have easily won . The joke about Homer apparently being familiar with Walt Whitman is one of David Silverman 's favorite jokes . 
 Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide praised the episode , calling it " Gag @-@ packed , and very touching " . The Quindecim , a college newspaper , published a top 25 The Simpsons episodes list and placed " Mother Simpson " in 19th place . IGN.com ranked Glenn Close 's performance as the 25th best guest appearance in the show 's history . In 2008 , Entertainment Weekly named Close one of the 16 best Simpsons guest stars . 
 = Who Can See It = 
 " Who Can See It " is a song by English musician George Harrison , released on his 1973 album Living in the Material World . The lyrics reflect Harrison 's uneasy feelings towards the Beatles ' legacy , three years after the group 's break @-@ up , and serve as his statement of independence from expectations raised by the band 's unprecedented popularity . Some music critics and biographers suggest that he wrote the song during a period of personal anguish , following the acclaim he had received as a solo artist with the 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass and his 1971 – 72 Bangladesh aid project . The revelatory nature of the lyrics has encouraged comparisons between Living in the Material World and John Lennon 's primal therapy @-@ inspired 1970 release , Plastic Ono Band . 
 A dramatic ballad in the Roy Orbison vein , the composition features unusual changes in time signature and a melody that incorporates musical tension . Harrison self @-@ produced the recording , which includes heavy orchestration and a choir , both arranged by John Barham . Several commentators consider Harrison 's vocal performance on " Who Can See It " to be among the finest of his career , while his production style has been likened to that of Beatles producer George Martin . The other musicians on the track are Nicky Hopkins , Klaus Voormann , Jim Keltner and Gary Wright . 
 Among reviews of the song , " Who Can See It " has been described variously as an " aching , yearning masterpiece " , a " song which goes on far too long to make its simple point " , and an " unequivocal statement " on Harrison 's identity . In line with his self @-@ image as a musician , regardless of his past as a Beatle , Harrison included " Who Can See It " in the setlist for his 1974 North American tour with Ravi Shankar , the first tour there by a former Beatle since the band 's break @-@ up . 
 = = Background and inspiration = = 
 As with the majority of the songs on his Living in the Material World album , George Harrison wrote " Who Can See It " over 1971 – 72 . In his autobiography , I , Me , Mine , he makes light of the emotion behind the song , describing it as simply " a true story meaning ' Give us a break , squire ' " . Simon Leng , Harrison 's musical biographer , recognises the song as a statement of considerable personal anguish , however . He writes of Harrison having been " deeply traumatized " by the effects of the Beatles ' unprecedented popularity , and equally disoriented by his success as a solo artist following their break @-@ up in April 1970 . According to Leng , Harrison was in the same state of internal conflict over 1972 – 73 as John Lennon had been when writing the song " Help ! " in 1965 , during his self @-@ styled " fat Elvis period " . Music critic Stephen Holden highlighted a similar comparison between the two ex @-@ Beatles in July 1973 , when he deemed Living in the Material World to be " as personal and confessional " as Lennon 's primal therapy @-@ inspired Plastic Ono Band album ( 1970 ) . 
 During the Beatles ' career , Harrison had been the first to tire of Beatlemania and the group 's celebrity status , and he had written songs rejecting what Leng terms the " artifice " surrounding the band . Lennon himself described the Beatles ' predicament as " four individuals who eventually recovered their <unk> after being submerged in a myth " . In addition , for Harrison , while he began to match Lennon and Paul McCartney as a songwriter towards the end of the group 's career , his relatively junior position in the Beatles was a source of frustration to him , which , according to music journalist Mikal Gilmore , left " deep and lasting wounds " . 
 Aside from being released from the psychological pressure of being a Beatle in 1970 , Harrison was the one who potentially benefited the most from the group 's break @-@ up . His 1970 triple album , All Things Must Pass , was a major commercial and critical success , eclipsing releases by both Lennon and McCartney . According to author Ian Inglis , Harrison became " popular music 's first statesman " as a result of both All Things Must Pass and his 1971 – 72 Bangladesh aid project . The last of these established humanitarianism as a new direction for rock music , in addition to focusing on Harrison the level of attention previously afforded the Beatles . While Leng describes " Who Can See It " as a " plea for understanding from a private man living his life in public " , Inglis writes that , after the " euphoria " of his recent achievements as a solo artist , Harrison was forced to confront " some of the more unpleasant realities of his everyday life " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Who Can See It " is in the musical key of E. The melody incorporates various augmented and diminished chords , which Harrison describes in I , Me , Mine as " all kinds of suspended chords " , since he played them in an open tuning on the guitar . The song starts with a solitary guitar figure and then builds in intensity through the verse and into the chorus , as musical tension matches the emotion of the lyrics . 
 Leng views " Who Can See It " as a " new type of ballad " from Harrison , one that combines a " dramatic edge " with rhythmic sophistication . The time signature shifts throughout the composition , from 4 / 4 to 6 / 4 and 5 / 8 , with brief portions in 5 / 4 and 3 / 4 . In Leng 's description , the melody features " sweepingly large chromatic intervals " , beginning with the verse 's third line – a four @-@ semitone swoop that recalls the ascending melismas commonly used in Indian music . Harrison later remarked , with reference to the boldness of the tune : " [ ' Who Can See It ' ] reminds me of Roy Orbison for some reason . He could do this good . " 
 Among the material Harrison wrote or finished for Living in the Material World , several songs reflect on his years with the Beatles , and in the case of " Who Can See It " , with bitterness . In the opening verse , he states : 
 I 've been held up 
 I 've been run down 
 I can see quite clearly now through those past years 
 When I played towing the line . 
 Inglis views these lines as a reference to Harrison 's working @-@ class upbringing as well as his years as a member of the Beatles . In the chorus that follows , Harrison contends that , having personally lived through these experiences , his sole wish is that his feelings " Should not be denied me now " , and he concludes : " I can see my life belongs to me / My love belongs to who can see it . " Inglis offers a simple <unk> of this statement : " he has paid his dues . Now he is his own man ... " 
 In the song 's second verse , Harrison sings of having " lived in fear " and witnessed the hatred created by " this sad world " . While later discussing his aversion to performing live after 1966 , Harrison presented a similar imagery , citing the Beatles ' concerns regarding the threat of assassination . He also referred to the band 's fame as " very one @-@ sided " , since the Beatles " gave their nervous systems " while receiving the adulation of their fans . 
 Leng finds the words to verse two typical of Harrison 's tendency towards " internalization of world events " in some of his songs from this period , whereby " hate , conflict and strife " are projected onto the " wider world " in the likes of " Who Can See It " and " The Light That Has Lighted the World " . Theologian Dale Allison views the mention of " this sad world " as a further reference to the essentially " tragic " nature of human existence , after " All Things Must Pass " and in anticipation of later Harrison songs such as " Stuck Inside a Cloud " , in that " notwithstanding all the success and adulation " , ultimately , " we are all alone " . Allison writes of the message behind " Who Can See It " : " Here he declares his freedom from his Beatle past , his freedom to be himself . " 
 = = Recording = = 
 Harrison had intended to co @-@ produce his long @-@ awaited follow @-@ up to All Things Must Pass with Phil Spector , a mainstay of his career since 1970 . Spector 's unreliability meant that Harrison was forced to produce Living in the Material World alone – an outcome that music critics Greg Kot and Zeth Lundy find regrettable , in light of how Spector 's signature Wall of Sound treatment might have suited ballads such as " Who Can See It " and " The Day the World Gets ' Round " . Another regular Harrison collaborator , John Barham , provided orchestral arrangements as before , and noted an " austere quality " in some of the new songs . " George was under stress during Living in the Material World , " Barham said later . " I felt that he was going through some kind of a crisis . I think it may have been spiritual , but I cannot be sure . " 
 Harrison taped the basic track for " Who Can See It " between October and December 1972 , either at the Beatles ' Apple Studio in London or at FPSHOT , his home studio in Henley , Oxfordshire . He recorded his vocals during the first two months of the new year , and Barham 's orchestration and choir were added in late February . 
 Harrison 's twin electric @-@ guitar parts recall the sound of the Beatles ' Abbey Road album , through his use of a Leslie rotary effect – a detail that Leng finds significant , given the song 's subject matter . In another Beatles comparison , music journalists Alan Clayson and John Metzger consider Harrison 's production on Material World to be similar to George Martin 's work with the band . Leng writes of " Who Can See It " having been " conceived with an Orbison vocal " , and the singing duly reflects Orbison 's more dramatic style . Harrison 's vocal reaches falsetto in places , while , in Clayson 's description , " swerving from muttered trepidation to strident intensity " during the course of the song . 
 Aside from Harrison , the musicians on the recording include Nicky Hopkins ( piano ) , Klaus Voormann ( bass ) and Jim Keltner ( drums ) . As can be heard in the outtake of " Who Can See It " available unofficially on the Living in the Alternate World bootleg , Gary Wright 's original contribution was a prominent harmonium part , superseded by Barham 's strings and brass on the released version . Leng nevertheless credits Wright with playing organ on the song . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Apple Records released Living in the Material World at the end of May 1973 in the United States and a month later in Britain . " Who Can See It " appeared as track 4 on side one of the LP format , in between what Leng terms the " perfect pop confection " " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " and another song that referenced Harrison 's Beatle past , " Living in the Material World " . Reflecting the album 's lyrical themes , Tom Wilkes 's art design contrasted a devout spiritual existence with life in the material world , by featuring Hindu religious images such as a painting of Krishna and his warrior prince Arjuna , and a photograph of Harrison and his fellow musicians at a banquet , surrounded by symbols of material wealth and success . 
 The album confirmed Harrison 's status as the most commercially successful ex @-@ Beatle , but it drew criticism from some reviewers for the number of slow songs among its eleven tracks , as well as the perceived preachy tone of Harrison 's lyrics . According to author Michael Frontani , lines such as " My life belongs to me " in " Who Can See It " " betrayed sentiments of a man increasingly at odds … with fans and critics who wanted him to be ' Beatle George , ' or at least to be less fixated on his spirituality " . 
 In his review for Rolling Stone , Stephen Holden wrote that , amid Material World 's " miraculous ... radiance " , the song represented " passionate testament " and " a beautiful ballad whose ascendant long @-@ line melody is the most distinguished of the album " . In Melody Maker , Michael Watts described Living in the Material World as " far , far removed from the Beatles " and " more interesting " lyrically than All Things Must Pass . Watts noted the " large autobiographical insights " provided in Harrison 's songwriting , of which " Who Can See It " showed " he 's found the way at last " . Writing of Harrison 's standing on an album he considered " as personal , in its own way , as anything that Lennon has done " : Watts said : " Harrison has always struck me before as simply a writer of very classy pop songs ; now he stands as something more than an entertainer . Now he 's being honest . " NME critic Bob Woffinden praised the song also , but suggested it was " ideal material " for someone with a wider vocal range than Harrison . 
 = = Retrospective reviews = = 
 Some recent reviewers have been less enthusiastic , with PopMatters ' Zeth Lundy opining that , rather than Harrison 's more " stripped @-@ down " production aesthetic , " Who Can See It " would have benefited from " the hyper @-@ drama of All Things Must Pass ' resonant abyss " . Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002 , Greg Kot similarly bemoaned the " hymn @-@ like calm " of the performance and its falling short of the " transcendent heights " of Harrison 's 1970 triple set . In their Solo Beatles Compendium , Chip Madinger and Mark Easter dismiss the track as a " song which goes on far too long to make its simple point " , a situation not helped by a " histrionic " vocal from Harrison . 
 Reviewing the 2006 reissue of Living in the Material World for Q magazine , Tom Doyle included it among the album 's best three tracks and wrote : " the introspective moods of The Light That Has Lighted The World and Who Can See It , with their ornate instrumentation and weepy vocals , are lovely things . " Former Mojo editor Mat Snow describes Material World as " a treat for the ears " and , while conceding Harrison 's limitations as a singer compared with Lennon and McCartney , he writes that Harrison " worked hard to ensure the choruses of ... ' Who Can See It ' caught the ear with their deep and delicious emotion " . In his review of the 2014 reissue of Harrison 's Apple catalogue , for Classic Rock , Paul Trynka refers to Material Word as an album that " sparkles with many gems " ; of these , he adds , " it 's the more restrained tracks – Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long , Who Can See It – that entrance : gorgeous pop songs , all the more forceful for their restraint . " New Zealand Herald journalist Graham Reid writes of Harrison " sound [ ing ] battered by recent events and the Beatle legacy " on " Who Can See It " , yet he cites the song as a " standout " on an album that " can be very moving " . 
 Among Beatles biographers , the Roy Orbison influence in " Who Can See It " is frequently noted , as is the fact that Harrison 's lead vocal is one of the best of his career . In addition to admiring the album 's disciplined , George Martin @-@ like production , Alan Clayson has written of the " hitherto unprecedented audacity " of the vocals found throughout Material World , adding : " He may have lacked the Big O 's operatic pitch , but ' Who Can See It ' was among George 's most magnificent performances on record . Veering cleanly into falsetto on other tracks , too , never had his pipes been so adept . " Elliot Huntley describes " Who Can See It " as a " beautiful ballad " and an " aching , yearning masterpiece " . In his chapter on George Harrison in the book The Dawn of Indian Music in the West , Peter Lavezzoli is another who highlights Harrison 's singing on this " gorgeous Roy Orbison @-@ esque ballad " . 
 While praising a vocal that " positively bursts with passion " , Leng identifies the song 's " prevailing emotions " as " bitterness and anger " and notes : " If any Beatles fan was laboring under the misapprehension that George had enjoyed the [ Beatles ] episode as much as they had , this song tells the exact opposite story . " Ian Inglis writes that the " rather ponderous " arrangement on " Who Can See It " limits its " entertainment " value but , like " The Light That Has Lighted the World " , the song is an " unequivocal statement of who he is " . 
 = = Live performance = = 
 In line with his stated refusal to play the role of " Beatle George " at the time , " Who Can See It " was among the songs rehearsed and played on Harrison 's North American tour with Ravi Shankar in November – December 1974 . Given the composition 's " intensity of sentiment " , Leng views it as a notable inclusion in the concert setlist . Harrison dropped the song in a program reshuffle following the opening show , however , due to his laryngitis @-@ ravaged vocals cords being unable to carry such a demanding tune . 
 The tour was the first North American tour by an ex @-@ Beatle , a fact that encouraged expectations from many critics and concert @-@ goers that were at odds with Harrison 's aim – which was to present a musically diverse show featuring a minimum of his Beatles @-@ era songs . In an attempt to justify himself , Harrison took to quoting from the chorus of " Who Can See It " during interviews , as an example of Gandhi 's advice to " create and preserve the image of your choice " .

 = HMS Nairana ( 1917 ) = 
 HMS Nairana ( / <unk> / ) was a passenger ferry that was requisitioned by the Royal Navy ( RN ) as a seaplane carrier in 1917 . She was laid down in Scotland in 1914 as TSS Nairana for the Australian shipping line Huddart Parker , but construction was suspended after the outbreak of the First World War . Following resumption of work , the ship was launched in 1915 , and converted to operate wheeled aircraft from her forward flying @-@ off deck , as well as floatplanes that were lowered into the water . She saw service during the war with the Grand Fleet , and in 1918 – 19 supported the British intervention in the Russian Civil War . 
 Nairana was returned to her former owners in 1921 and refitted in her original planned configuration , and spent the next 27 years ferrying passengers and cargo between Tasmania and Melbourne . She was twice struck by rogue waves in Bass Strait , and nearly capsized on both occasions . Nairana was the only Bass Strait ferry not requisitioned for military service in the Second World War , and so became the sole passenger ship with service to Tasmania during the conflict . She was laid up in 1948 , wrecked in a storm three years later and scrapped in situ in 1953 – 54 .

 In December 1913 , negotiations between the Australian shipping line Huddart Parker and the British shipbuilders William Denny and Brothers began for a passenger ship with some cargo capacity to serve in the Australian coastal trade . The shipping line wanted a vessel that would improve on their earlier ferry <unk> , which had also been built by Denny 's . Huddart Parker decided on a design that could carry 800 long tons deadweight ( DWT ) of cargo on a draught of 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) and could maintain 19 @.@ 5 knots ( 36 @.@ 1 km / h ; 22 @.@ 4 mph ) for 12 hours . The ship was ordered on 22 January 1914 , at a cost of £ 129 @,@ 830 , for delivery in May 1915 . She was named Nairana ( an Aboriginal Australian name for the " golden eagle " or " eagle of the sun " ) . 
 Nairana was designed to accommodate 280 first @-@ class and 112 second @-@ class passengers , and had a crew of 26 officers , 42 crewmen and 25 stokers . She had an overall length of 328 feet ( 100 @.@ 0 m ) , a beam of 45 feet 6 inches ( 13 @.@ 9 m ) , and a draught of 14 feet 7 inches ( 4 @.@ 4 m ) . Designed to displace 3 @,@ 479 long tons ( 3 @,@ 535 t ) Nairana had tonnages of 3 @,@ 547 gross register tons ( GRT ) , 1 @,@ 118 long tons DWT , 2 @,@ 014 net register tons ( NRT ) and 3 @,@ 311 tons Builder 's Old Measurement . 
 The ship was launched 21 June 1915 at the Denny shipyard in Dumbarton , Scotland . The launch had been delayed nine months , after the British Government ordered that all construction workers be pulled from non @-@ military vessels after the start of World War I , and work had been resumed only to make her slipway available for warships . She remained at anchor for the next year and a half . The Royal Navy purchased her on 27 February 1917 for completion as a combined landplane and seaplane carrier . The price of £ 138 @,@ 118 included the cost of conversion to her new role . The ship was nearly complete when requisitioned , although her propelling machinery was not yet installed . Consequently , only limited internal modifications , notably the addition of three large workshops , could be made .

 HMS Nairana displaced 3 @,@ 070 long tons ( 3 @,@ 120 t ) in RN service . She was 352 feet ( 107 @.@ 3 m ) long overall , had a beam of 45 @.@ 6 feet ( 547 @.@ 2 in ) , and a mean draught of 13 feet 2 inches ( 4 @.@ 01 m ) . The ship was powered by two sets of Parsons geared steam turbines designed to produce a total of 6 @,@ 700 shaft horsepower ( 5 @,@ 000 kW ) , each driving one three @-@ bladed propeller . The turbines were powered by steam provided by six Babcock & Wilcox water @-@ tube boilers at a working pressure of 202 psi ( 1 @,@ 393 kPa ; 14 kgf / cm2 ) . On her sea trials , Nairana made 7 @,@ 003 shp ( 5 @,@ 222 kW ) and reached 20 @.@ 32 knots ( 37 @.@ 63 km / h ; 23 @.@ 38 mph ) . She carried 448 long tons ( 455 t ) of coal which gave her a range of 1 @,@ 060 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 960 km ; 1 @,@ 220 mi ) at a speed of 19 @.@ 5 knots ( 36 @.@ 1 km / h ; 22 @.@ 4 mph ) . Her crew numbered 278 , including 90 aviation personnel . 
 The ship was armed with four 40 @-@ calibre , 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) 12 @-@ pounder 12 cwt quick @-@ firing guns on single mounts . Two of these were mounted on the forecastle as low @-@ angle guns , and the other two were mounted on the rear hangar roof as anti @-@ aircraft guns . They fired 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 359 ft / s ( 719 m / s ) ; this gave a maximum range of 9 @,@ 720 yd ( 8 @,@ 890 m ) . 
 Nairana was fitted with a 95 @-@ foot ( 29 @.@ 0 m ) flying @-@ off deck forward , intended for aircraft with wheeled undercarriages , and a prominent hangar aft . A massive latticework gantry crane protruded aft from the hangar roof and a twin @-@ boom derrick forward were fitted to handle her aircraft . The smaller forward hangar was built under the ship 's bridge and the aircraft were raised to the flight deck overhead by a 22 @-@ by @-@ 14 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 7 m × 4 @.@ 3 m ) lift , one of the first in the RN . The forward hangar could fit four single @-@ seat fighters and the rear hangar had a capacity of four floatplanes . The ship could lower them into the water while steaming at 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) and recover the floatplanes at 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6 @.@ 9 mph ) . She carried 1 @,@ 200 imperial gallons ( 5 @,@ 500 l ; 1 @,@ 400 US gal ) of petrol for her aircraft . 
 During her service , Nairana carried Beardmore W.B.III , Fairey Campania , Short Type 184 , and Sopwith Baby , Pup , and <unk> Camel aircraft .

 Upon commissioning on 25 August 1917 , Nairana was assigned to the Battle Cruiser Force of the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow , carrying four Short Type 184 floatplanes and four Beardmore W.B.III aircraft . She saw little operational use as she was employed for pilot training and ferrying aircraft to ships equipped with flying @-@ off decks . 
 In 1918 , Nairana participated in the North Russia Campaign in support of the British intervention in the Russian Civil War . On 1 August she took part in what was probably the first fully combined air , sea and land military operation in history , when she and her Campania seaplanes joined Allied ground forces and other ships in driving the Bolsheviks out of their fortifications on <unk> Island at the mouth of the Northern Dvina River . Nairana used her own guns on the Bolshevik batteries . She and her aircraft then scouted ahead of the Allied force as it proceeded up the channel to Arkhangelsk . The appearance of one of her <unk> over Arkhangelsk caused the Bolshevik troops there to panic and abandon the city . Nairana sustained no damage during the assault . As of October , the ship was carrying five <unk> and two Sopwith Babys , although these last two aircraft were replaced by Sopwith Camels in 1919 . 
 By May 1919 , Nairana was refitting in Rosyth . She then ferried a flight of Fairey IIIC floatplanes to North Russia for use by the Royal Air Force later in the month . She remained at Murmansk for several weeks before proceeding on to Kem . There the ship was inspected by Rear @-@ Admiral John Green , Rear @-@ Admiral Commanding in the White Sea , on 29 July . At the end of August , Nairana proceeded to Onega where her aircraft observed for the monitor HMS Erebus as the latter bombarded the town for several days before returning to Kem . She departed Russia on 8 October and arrived back at Rosyth four days later . Later that month the ship was transferred to Devonport to begin the process of decommissioning from naval service .

 The British Government sold Nairana to William Denny and Brothers after her service in Russia to be rebuilt to her original plans , and the ship was handed over to Huddart Parker in January 1921 . Nairana arrived in Melbourne in March , after a two @-@ month voyage from Plymouth , and commenced her first Bass Strait crossing on 18 April 1921 . She was registered in Melbourne under the British flag and was allocated the United Kingdom official number <unk> , and the code letters <unk> . Transferred to Tasmanian Steamers in January 1922 , she operated the Bass Strait run from Launceston , Devonport , and Burnie to Melbourne for the next 26 years . She accommodated 250 passengers in first class and 140 in second , and generally cruised at 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . She was withdrawn from service for overhaul at Sydney 's Cockatoo Island in October 1922 , and again in September – October 1923 . In January 1925 Nairana was chartered by the Federal Government and crewed by non @-@ union labour , following a strike by shipping workers . She was taken out of service for a major overhaul at Cockatoo Island from May to October 1927 . On the night of 24 January 1928 , she was struck by a rogue wave in heavy seas , and almost capsized ; one woman , already ill when she boarded in Launceston , died . 
 As well as passengers , Nairana regularly carried cargo , including gold bullion , and live animals such as horses and cattle between Tasmania and the mainland . A Tasmanian devil being transported to Melbourne Zoo in a wooden crate placed in one of the ship 's four horse stalls escaped by chewing a hole through its box , and was never seen again . In 1934 , her code letters were changed to <unk> . Nairana was withdrawn from service in December 1935 as a result of a ship workers ' strike , returning to the Bass Strait run in the new year . As she neared Port Phillip Bay on 12 April 1936 , on a clear day with apparently calm seas , she was again struck by a rogue wave and rolled onto her port side before swinging back over to starboard and eventually righting . The impact injured most of her 88 passengers and killed four , including a family of three who disappeared after being swept overboard . Despite this , she proceeded to her berth in the Yarra River , having sustained only minor damage . 
 After war was declared in September 1939 , Nairana began carrying military personnel as well as commercial passengers . Her hull , previously black , was painted grey , and she was fitted with paravanes to defend against mines , a BL ( breech @-@ loading ) 4 @-@ inch Mk VIII anti @-@ submarine gun on the aft promenade deck , and a 20 mm Oerlikon anti @-@ aircraft gun on her deckhouse . She also carried some .303 rifles for shooting at mines . As a coal burner that emitted tell @-@ tale black smoke visible for miles , Nairana was not considered for war service , the only Bass Strait ferry not to be requisitioned . She thus became the sole commercial passenger vessel to operate between Tasmania and the mainland through the war years , maintaining a heavy schedule . The ship underwent repairs for 13 days at Williamstown , Victoria , after running aground in the Tamar River in 1943 . 
 Nairana had her final overhaul at Cockatoo Island between February and April 1944 . By mid @-@ 1947 , airlines had captured a significant portion of the passenger trade across Bass Strait , and Nairana 's schedule was reduced . On 31 December , her captain collapsed and died as he was speaking to two of his officers while the ship was alongside in Burnie ; a post @-@ mortem examination attributed the death to heart disease . Nairana made her last crossing from Tasmania to the mainland on 13 – 14 February 1948 , after which she was retired and laid up in Melbourne . Sold for scrap to William Mussell Pty Ltd , Williamstown , Nairana broke her moorings during a gale on 18 February 1951 and was driven ashore off Port Melbourne . <unk> , she was broken up in place in 1953 – 54 .

 Throughout her career as a Bass Strait ferry , Nairana had displayed a commemorative plaque and a photograph from her days as a carrier , presented by the British Admiralty in recognition of her service in World War I , and especially her part in the fall of Arkhangelsk . After she was retired , the plaque went on display at the Museum of Wellington City & Sea , New Zealand , and the photograph at the Launceston Maritime Museum , Tasmania .

 Street Gang : The Complete History of Sesame Street is a non @-@ fiction book chronicling the history of the children 's television program , Sesame Street . Street Gang is journalist and writer Michael Davis 's first book , published by Viking Press in 2008 . On bookshelves in time for the show 's 40th anniversary in 2009 , the book developed out of a TV Guide article Davis wrote to commemorate the show 's 35th anniversary in 2004 . Davis spent five years researching and writing the book , and conducted hundreds of interviews with the show 's creators , cast , and crew . 
 Street Gang begins with a description of Muppet creator Jim Henson 's 1990 funeral , from the perspective of co @-@ creator Joan Ganz Cooney . Its first twelve chapters describe the origin , development , and early years of Sesame Street and the Children 's Television Workshop , the organization created to oversee the production of the show and other projects . Davis includes the biographies of many of the key people involved with the creation and production of Sesame Street . Subsequent chapters chronicle the rest of the show 's history , up to its 40th anniversary in 2009 . 
 Reviews of Street Gang were mostly positive . Most reviewers were impressed by Davis ' research and attention to detail , but some felt that it was too episodic and was more of an oral history than a dispassionate history of the show 's history . One reviewer predicted that the book would become the definitive source of Sesame Street . Street Gang was made into an audio book , narrated by Caroll Spinney , the same day it was published . A second edition was published later that year .
