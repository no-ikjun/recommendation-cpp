 Most of the commercial visitor activity in the gorge is on the Longleat @-@ owned south side , including access to the two main commercial show caves and the visitor centre , which is operated by Longleat @-@ owned company Cheddar Gorge and Caves Ltd under director Hugh Cornwell . Due to the fact that tourist numbers have dropped through the show caves from 400 @,@ 000 a year in the 1980s to 150 @,@ 000 , in 2013 Ceawlin <unk> , Viscount Weymouth who runs the Longleat estate on behalf of the family trust , proposed installation of a 600 metres ( 2 @,@ 000 ft ) 18 @-@ gondola cable car estimated to cost £ 10M , taking visitors from the entrance area to the caves directly to the top of the southside cliffs . The National Trust have opposed the proposed development , stating that it will spoil the view and cheapen the experience , creating a " fairground ride " that will make the area feel more like an amusement park . If planning permission is gained in Spring 2014 , then operations would start in Spring 2016 . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Notable species at the gorge include dormice , yellow @-@ necked mice , slow worms and adders and the rare large blue butterfly ( Maculinea arion ) , and small pearl @-@ bordered fritillary ( Boloria selene ) . 
 A wide variety of wild birds may be seen in Cheddar Gorge including peregrine falcons , buzzards , kestrels , ravens and the grasshopper warbler ( Locustella naevia ) . 
 The flora include chalk grassland @-@ loving species such as marjoram and wild thyme . The Cheddar pink , Dianthus gratianopolitanus , also known as <unk> , only grows in the wild in the gorge . It was once common in the gorge but declined after being picked by collectors . It is also home to unique species of whitebeam . The nationally rare little robin geranium ( Geranium purpureum ) , and Cheddar bedstraw ( Galium <unk> ) and the nationally scarce species include slender tare ( Vicia <unk> ) , dwarf mouse @-@ ear ( Cerastium <unk> ) and rock stonecrop ( Sedum <unk> ) also occur in the gorge . It is one of the very few areas in southern Britain where the lichens <unk> saccata , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> can be found . 
 The gorge is also an important site for whitebeams and in 2009 a survey was carried out by botanists from the Welsh National Herbarium as part of a nationwide survey of whitebeams . Among the eight species identified were three new species previously unknown to science . Nineteen specimens with oval @-@ shaped leaves , were named the " Cheddar whitebeam " , Sorbus <unk> , fifteen specimens with roundish leaves and greyish brown bark were named the " Twin Cliffs whitebeam " , Sorbus <unk> , and thirteen with long , narrow leaves were named " Gough ’ s Rock whitebeam " , Sorbus <unk> . The Cheddar whitebeam , which has evolved as a cross between the common whitebeam and the grey @-@ leaved whitebeam , is unique to the gorge , but its survival is threatened by the goats that were introduced specifically to keep down the growth of new trees and encourage the proliferation of rare plant species such as the Cheddar pink . Cuttings have been taken from the trees to be grafted and grown on at the Welsh National Herbarium . 
 Longleat Estate has fenced off a large part of its land and has introduced goats , as part of a programme to encourage the biodiversity of the area ; the goats were intended to replace the sheep that grazed in the gorge until the 1970s . The National Trust announced in March 2007 that it plans to release a flock of sheep on its side of the gorge for the same purpose , but will first consult local residents and interested parties on whether to fence off the gorge or introduce cattle grids to prevent the sheep from straying . There is already a small flock of feral Soay sheep in the gorge .

 The two main caves open to the public are on the southside of the Gorge , owned by Longleat Estate . The extensive Gough 's Cave and the smaller Cox 's Cave are both named after their respective discoverers . Both are known for their geology , and it has been suggested that the caves were the site of prehistoric cheese @-@ making . Gough 's cave , which was discovered in 1903 , leads around 400 m ( 437 yd ) into the rock @-@ face , and contains a variety of large rock chambers and formations . Cox 's Cave , discovered in 1837 , is smaller but contains many intricate formations . In 2016 Cox 's cave was turned into " <unk> " , a multimedia walk @-@ through experience with theatrical lighting and video projection . 
 The Gorge 's many caves are home to colonies of Greater and Lesser horseshoe bats . 
 In 1999 the Channel 4 television programme Time Team investigated Cooper 's Hole in an attempt to find evidence of Palaeolithic human activity . 
 These caves are the inspirations for the caves behind Helm 's Deep in J.R.R. Tolkien 's The Two Towers . 
 Several of the caves have been scheduled as ancient monuments as nationally important archaeological sites including : Gough 's Old Cave , Great <unk> 's Hole , Saye 's Hole , Soldier 's Hole and Sun Hole .

 Cliff Road ( B3135 ) , which runs through the Gorge , offers a popular climb for bicyclists and has a maximum gradient of 16 % . The ascent featured in stage 6 of the 2011 Tour of Britain . 
 There are about 350 officially graded rock climbing routes on the 27 cliffs that make up Cheddar Gorge , which are generally open to climbers between 1 October and 15 March each year . Each of the routes is named and included in the British Mountaineering Council guidebook . Although the majority of the climbs are " trad " or " traditional " , which means that the leader places protection as they go up , there are also some " sport " routes where bolts are left in place . Climber Chris Bonington was the first to scale the Coronation Street route in 1965 . 
 Visitors to the gorge have experienced a number of accidents . Rescue services , including local mountain rescue and cave rescue groups , frequently use the gorge to stage exercises . It is also used as a training location for military rescue helicopter pilots . 
 The Cheddar Man Museum of Prehistory inspired by the discovery of ancient hominids such as Cheddar Man contains information about the caves and their palaeontological development . Exhibits include original flint tools and human remains excavated from the caves . 
 There is a clifftop walk from Jacob 's Ladder along the crest of the gorge and back to the road , with views of the gorge . A caving experience is offered within Gough 's Cave . There is a path of 275 steps , built up the side of the gorge , known as Jacob 's Ladder after the Biblical description of a ladder to the heavens . A watchtower at the top provides a 360 – degree view of the entire area and village . An open @-@ top bus tour operates during the summer . Cheddar cheese is made in the lower part of the gorge .

 = Operation Leader = 
 Operation Leader was a successful attack conducted by United States Navy aircraft against German shipping in the vicinity of Bodø , Norway , on 4 October 1943 , during World War II . It was carried out by aircraft flying from the aircraft carrier USS Ranger , which at the time was attached to the British Home Fleet . The American airmen located many German and Norwegian ships in this area , destroying five and damaging another seven . Two German aircraft searching for the Allied fleet were shot down as well . Three American aircraft were destroyed in combat during the operation , and another crashed while landing . 
 = = Background = = 
 During mid to late 1943 the Home Fleet , the Royal Navy 's main striking force stationed in the United Kingdom , was augmented by two forces of United States Navy warships to replace British ships which had been dispatched to the Mediterranean and Pacific . These reinforcements were considered necessary to ensure that the fleet remained able to counter the German battle group based in Norway which was built around the battleships Tirpitz and Scharnhorst and the heavy cruiser Lützow . 
 The initial US Navy task force arrived in May , and comprised the battleships USS Alabama and South Dakota , the heavy cruiser USS Tuscaloosa and five destroyers . This force came under the command of Rear Admiral Olaf M. Hustvedt and conducted a number of patrols into the Norwegian Sea with British Home Fleet warships , but did not make contact with German forces . The two battleships and the destroyers were withdrawn in August , and proceeded to the Pacific . 
 A second task force built around the aircraft carrier USS Ranger replaced the two battleships in September . The other elements of this force were the heavy cruisers USS Augusta and Tuscaloosa as well as five destroyers , with Rear Admiral Hustvedt remaining in command . Ranger 's air wing was made up of three squadrons : VF @-@ 41 which was equipped with 27 Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters , VB @-@ 41 with 27 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers and VT @-@ 41 which operated 18 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers . Prior to Ranger 's arrival the Home Fleet had only a single aircraft carrier , the elderly HMS Furious , which was unavailable for operations as she was undergoing a refit . Ranger had last seen combat against Vichy French forces while supporting the Operation Torch landings in Morocco during November 1942 , and had subsequently been used to ferry aircraft to North Africa and train aircrews off the United States east coast . On 8 September the main body of the Home Fleet , including the American task force , sortied in response to reports that Tirpitz , Scharnhorst and nine destroyers had put to sea . However , the Allied force returned to the Home Fleet 's main base at Scapa Flow the next day after it was learned that the German ships had returned to port after briefly attacking Allied positions on Spitsbergen . 
 On 22 September the German battle group in Norway was attacked by several British midget submarines . This attack inflicted significant damage on Tirpitz , leaving the battleship unable to proceed to sea until repairs were complete . Once this was known to the Allies , the commander of the Home Fleet , Admiral Bruce Fraser , judged that the changed balance of forces would allow his force to take on a more offensive role by attacking German shipping off Norway and restarting the Arctic Convoys to the Soviet Union . 
 = = Attack = = 
 Fraser followed up on the midget submarine attack by deciding to dispatch the main body of the Home Fleet to conduct an air attack against ports and German shipping in northern Norway . Ranger was assigned responsibility for attacking the port of Bodø , which was an important rendezvous point for German and German @-@ controlled Norwegian shipping . Fraser also initially planned to use the aircraft carrier HMS Formidable to attack shipping in a port to the south of Bodø , but this element of the operation was cancelled due to unfavourable weather . While several Luftwaffe ( German Air Force ) bases were located near Bodø , most of the aircraft previously stationed in northern Norway had been transferred elsewhere and those that remained posed little threat to the Allied fleet . 
 The Home Fleet 's plans were informed by considerable intelligence on German shipping movements and forces in northern Norway . The Royal Navy 's Operational Intelligence Centre collated information on these topics , and regularly provided assessments to the Home Fleet and other commands . The choice of the Bodø area as the target for the attack was made on the basis of Ultra intelligence obtained by decoding German radio signals , from which the Allies learned that the ships in the region included the large oil tanker Schleswig which was carrying fuel for the German battle group at Altafjord . In addition , at the time of Operation Leader two groups of Norwegian Secret Intelligence Service ( SIS ) agents operated radio transmitters on the coast of Helgeland ; " Crux III " on the island of Renga and " Pisces " on <unk> . Both groups provided reports to the Allies on the weather and shipping movements in the target area in the lead @-@ up to the attack . From 3 October onwards , " Crux III " radioed weather reports every half hour . 
 The Home Fleet sailed from Scapa Flow on 2 October . The British elements of the force were the battleships HMS Duke of York ( Fraser 's flagship ) and Anson , the light cruiser HMS Belfast and seven destroyers . The US Navy component comprised Ranger , Tuscaloosa and four destroyers . The Allied ships were not detected by German forces during their voyage north , and arrived at the flying @-@ off position for Ranger 's air wing approximately 140 miles ( 230 km ) off Bodø shortly before dawn on 4 October . 
 The US Navy attack force was organised into two groups of aircraft : the Northern Attack Group , which was to strike shipping at Bodø , and the Southern Attack Group which was to target ships near the town of Sandnessjøen nearly 100 miles ( 160 km ) to the south . Each of the two groups had one Norwegian navigator from No. 333 Squadron RAF in the lead aircraft , providing knowledge of the local geography . 
 The Northern Attack Group , which comprised 20 Dauntless dive bombers escorted by 8 Wildcat fighters , began to take off at 6 : 18 am . These aircraft flew at low altitude towards Bodø until their crews sighted <unk> Lighthouse , and then turned to the north and climbed as they neared the target area . Weather conditions were clear , with the air crews having good visibility . Four Dauntlesses and a pair of Wildcats were detached from the force shortly after it passed <unk> Lighthouse to search for German shipping near <unk> island . They soon sighted the 8 @,@ 000 GRT German freighter La Plata , and two of the dive bombers attacked the ship . The Americans believed that La Plata was badly damaged , and the six aircraft rejoined the main body of the Northern Attack Group . 
 In the meantime the other American aircraft continued north , sighting but not attacking many small cargo ships and fishing boats . At 7 : 30 am they located a German convoy comprising the steamer <unk> and the tanker Schleswig under the escort of the minesweeper M 365 . Eight of the Dauntlesses attacked Schleswig and another pair targeted <unk> , inflicting significant damage on both ships . One of the escorting Wildcats was damaged by gunfire during the attack and returned to Ranger . Schleswig was beached to avoid sinking , and later salvaged and brought to Bodø for repairs . Following this engagement , the eight Dauntlesses which had yet to drop their bombs continued on to Bodø where they attacked four small German cargo ships . All of these vessels were hit : the 2 @,@ 719 GRT ore carrier Rabat was sunk , Cap Guir badly damaged , a bomb which nearly struck Malaga inflicted minor damage and the small steamer Ibis was machine gunned . Two of the dive bombers were shot down by anti @-@ aircraft guns located on the shore and ships . The crew of one of the aircraft survived and were taken prisoner after ditching into the sea , but both men on the other Dauntless were killed . 
 The Southern Attack Group began launching from Ranger at 7 : 08 am . It was made up of ten Avenger torpedo bombers and six Wildcats . Two of the Avengers attacked the 4 @,@ 991 GRT Norwegian cargo ship Topeka off the island of <unk> south of Sandnessjøen , resulting in the ship being set on fire and beached to avoid sinking . Three of the Norwegian crew members on Topeka were killed in the attack , along with several German soldiers manning anti @-@ aircraft guns on board the ship . One of the attacking aircraft was shot down by anti @-@ aircraft fire from the shore with only its pilot surviving . Topeka was carrying a cargo of cement and timber , and had until the previous evening been sailing in an escorted German convoy . Local fishermen made their way to the burning vessel to help rescue those on board . 
 Following the attack on Topeka the American aircraft continued north , and bombed and sank the 687 GRT Norwegian cargo liner Vaagan off <unk> without loss of life . The crew of Vaagan had observed the bombing of Topeka and brought their unarmed ship close to shore and lowered the lifeboats in preparation for a possible attack . Vaagan was carrying a cargo mostly of food for civilian consumption , and the sinking led to a margarine shortage in parts of northern Norway . The force subsequently bombed La Plata , causing her to be beached on the island <unk> where the ammunition on board exploded and she burned for several days . The aircraft also bombed the 4 @,@ 300 GRT Kriegsmarine troop ship Skramstad ( a Norwegian cargo ship requisitioned with her crew by the German occupying authorities ) , which had some 850 German soldiers embarked and was protected by two escorts . Skramstad was severely damaged and beached , burning for days . According to some sources 200 of the troops were killed , while Norwegian sources state that only one Norwegian sailor and a small number of German soldiers were killed . According to further Norwegian sources , the Norwegian resistance movement claimed in a report after the attack that around 360 Germans had been killed in the bombing of Skramstad while the Germans admitted in their reports to the deaths of 37 soldiers . The American aircraft also strafed the German cargo ship <unk> and attacked the ammunition barge <unk> , which was hit by a bomb and beached . After all the aircraft had completed their attacks , the force returned to Ranger shortly before 9 : 00 am . In addition to the four aircraft lost , six had suffered damage from anti @-@ aircraft artillery . 
 The German response to the attack was hampered by capacity problems in the military lines of communication . Following the attacks , a German report described their channels of communications as " ... constantly noisy with interruptions . " during the attack . This prevented the Germans from sending warnings once the attack had begun . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 At about 2 pm on 4 October , as the Home Fleet was sailing westwards , three German reconnaissance aircraft approached Ranger . At this time four Wildcats were providing a combat air patrol over the fleet , and were guided to intercept the German aircraft by Ranger 's fighter director . Two of the fighters shot down a Junkers Ju 88 bomber 22 miles ( 35 km ) from the carrier , and the other pair downed a Heinkel He 115 float plane 13 miles ( 21 km ) from Ranger . The remaining aircraft , a Ju 88 , was not sighted by the fighter pilots and managed to escape . These were the first German aircraft to have been shot down by US Navy aircraft . One of the Wildcats involved in this engagement crashed during landing , but its pilot survived . All of the elements of the Home Fleet dispatched for Operation Leader returned to Scapa Flow by 6 October . 
 Wartime Allied military commanders and post @-@ war historians deemed Operation Leader a success . Rear Admiral Hustvedt believed that the best result of the attack was that it demonstrated that American and British ships could work together with " effectiveness , mutual understanding and complete cooperation " . Admiral Patrick N. L. Bellinger , the air commander of the US Navy 's Atlantic Fleet was also pleased with the performance of the aircrews involved in the operation . Following the operation the commander of the Southern Attack Group , Commander J. A. Ruddy , was decorated with the Distinguished Flying Cross , while other servicemen taking part in the operation were awarded the Air Medal and the Purple Heart . The British official historian Stephen Roskill judged that the attack was an " outstanding success " , especially as it was the first combat mission for sixty percent of the aircrews involved . 
 Writing in 2012 , historian Robert C. Stern claimed that it is difficult to determine how many ships were sunk during Operation Leader as some of the vessels which were run ashore were possibly refloated and repaired . He assessed that five ships ( Cap Guir , La Plata , Rabat , Skramstad and Vaagan ) were probably destroyed , with these vessels having a total of approximately 19 @,@ 000 gross register tonnage of carrying capacity . In contrast , Norwegian sources pre @-@ dating Stern 's claims by decades , state that two ships ( Rabat and Vaagan ) were sunk , and three ships ( La Plata , Skramstad and Topeka ) were damaged beyond repair . Cap Guir , assessed by Stern as probably destroyed , survived the damage inflicted by the American aircraft at Bodø , but was sunk by Soviet torpedo bombers in the Baltic in April 1945 . 
 Stern has also written that the disruption to the convoys off Norway caused by Operation Leader would have caused even greater damage to the German war effort than the shipping losses . This is in line with a wartime assessment by the British Ministry of Economic Warfare , which estimated that the raid was the main factor responsible for a 58 percent decrease in the amount of iron ore shipped from the northern Norwegian port of Narvik during October 1943 . 
 Operation Leader was both the only offensive operation undertaken by the US Navy in northern European waters during World War II , and the last major American operation in this theatre of the war . Ranger remained with the Home Fleet until being replaced by British aircraft carriers in late November 1943 , during which time she took part in a patrol of the Norwegian Sea . The carrier departed Scapa Flow on 26 November , and arrived in Boston on 6 December . Ranger was used to train aircrews and transport aircraft for the remainder of the war , and did not see combat again . 
 The German forces in Norway were taken by surprise during Operation Leader . The area had not been raided by carrier @-@ borne aircraft for two years , leading to inadequate preparations for such an attack . Precautions against further raids were subsequently put in place , and the British carrier forces which repeatedly attacked Norway until the end of the war did not encounter any concentrations of shipping like that which Ranger 's airmen located off Bodø . Following the attack , the Germans launched a search in the area for radio transmitters , arresting several local Norwegians and narrowly missing the agents of the " Pisces " group . The two members of the " Pisces " team were evacuated to the United Kingdom by Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat on 24 November 1943 . The last SIS agents of the " Crux " group were evacuated from Renga by a No. 330 Squadron RAF Catalina on 6 June 1944 , but the transmitter on the island continued sending reports to the United Kingdom for the duration of the war , manned by a local volunteer who had been trained by the agents .

 = French battleship Henri IV = 
 Henri IV was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship of the French Navy built to test some of the ideas of the prominent naval architect Louis @-@ Émile Bertin . She began World War I as guardship at Bizerte . She was sent to reinforce the Allied naval force in the Dardanelles campaign of 1915 , although some of her secondary armament had been removed for transfer to Serbia in 1914 . Afterwards , she was relegated to second @-@ line roles before being sent to Taranto as a depot ship in 1918 . She was struck from the navy list in 1920 and scrapped the following year . 
 = = Design = = 
 Henri IV was designed by the famous French naval architect Louis @-@ Émile Bertin to evaluate some of his ideas . She was designed to make her a small target and lacked most of the normal rear superstructure common to ships of her period , other than that needed to keep her rear turret from being washed out . Her rear hull had only 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) of freeboard , although she was built up to the normal upper deck height amidships and at the bow for better sea @-@ keeping and to provide for her crew . Her superstructure was narrow and recessed from the hull above the main deck . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Henri IV was smaller than her predecessors , at 108 metres ( 354 ft 4 in ) overall . She had a beam of 22 @.@ 2 metres ( 72 ft 10 in ) and a maximum draft of 7 @.@ 5 metres ( 24 ft 7 in ) . She was significantly lighter than the Charlemagne @-@ class battleships and displaced only 8 @,@ 948 metric tons ( 8 @,@ 807 long tons ) normally , some 2 @,@ 300 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 260 long tons ) less than the earlier ships . Her crew consisted of 26 officers and 438 enlisted men . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Henri IV had three vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one propeller shaft . The engines were rated at 11 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 8 @,@ 600 kW ) using steam provided by 24 Niclausse boilers and gave a top speed of 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) . She carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 100 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 080 long tons ; 1 @,@ 210 short tons ) of coal that gave her a range of 7 @,@ 750 nautical miles ( 14 @,@ 350 km ; 8 @,@ 920 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Henri IV carried her main armament of two 40 @-@ caliber 274 mm ( 10 @.@ 8 in ) Canon de 274 mm Modèle 1893 / <unk> in two single @-@ gun turrets , one forward on the upper deck and the other on the main deck at the rear . The guns fired 255 kg ( 562 lb ) armor @-@ piercing projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 865 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 840 ft / s ) . 
 The ship 's secondary armament consisted of seven 45 @-@ caliber 138 @.@ 6 mm ( 5 @.@ 46 in ) Canon de 164 mm Modèle 1893 guns . Four were mounted in individual casemates on the main deck ; two more were mounted on the shelter deck with gun shields and the last gun was mounted in a shelter deck turret superfiring over the rear main gun turret . This was the first superfiring turret in naval history and , in this case , was not very successful because the barrel of the 138 mm gun was too short to clear the sighting hood of the turret below . These guns fired 35 – 30 kg ( 77 – 66 lb ) shells at muzzle velocities of 730 – 770 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 400 – 2 @,@ 500 ft / s ) . 
 Twelve 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) 40 @-@ caliber Canon de 47 mm Modèle 1885 Hotchkiss guns were mounted as anti @-@ torpedo boat guns . They were mounted in platforms in the foremast and mainmast and on the superstructure . They fired a 1 @.@ 49 @-@ kilogram ( 3 @.@ 3 lb ) projectile at 610 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ) to a maximum range of 4 @,@ 000 metres ( 4 @,@ 400 yd ) . Their theoretical maximum rate of fire was fifteen rounds per minute , but only seven rounds per minute sustained . Two submerged 450 mm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes were also carried . Exactly which types of torpedoes carried is unknown , but most of the torpedoes in service during the war had warheads of 110 kilograms ( 240 lb ) , maximum speeds of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) and maximum ranges of 6 @,@ 000 meters ( 6 @,@ 600 yd ) . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 Henri IV had a waterline armor belt of Harvey armor that was 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) high and tapered from the maximum thickness of 280 mm ( 11 in ) that to 180 mm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) at the ship 's ends . The belt ended short of the stern in a 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) traverse bulkhead . The lower edge of this belt tapered as well from 180 to 75 mm ( 7 @.@ 1 to 3 @.@ 0 in ) in thickness . The upper armor belt was mostly 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick and ran from the bow to 9 @.@ 1 m ( 360 in ) aft of the midsection . It was generally 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) high , but increased to 4 m ( 13 ft ) forward and ended in a 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) traverse bulkhead . The maximum thickness of the armored deck was 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) , but tapered to 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) at the ship 's ends . Below this was a thinner armored deck that tapered from 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) on the centerline to 35 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) at the edges . It curved down about 91 cm ( 36 in ) to form a torpedo bulkhead before it met up with the inner bottom . This system was based on experiments conducted in 1894 and was more modern than that used in the Russian battleship Tsesarevich although it was still too close to the side of the ship . The main turret armor was 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) in thickness and the ammunition shafts were protected by 240 mm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) of armor . The casemates for the 138 mm guns ranged from 75 – 115 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 – 4 @.@ 5 in ) in thickness and their ammunition tubes had 164 @.@ 7 mm ( 6 @.@ 48 in ) of armor . 
 = = Construction and service = = 
 Henri IV was laid down at Cherbourg on 15 July 1897 and launched on 23 August 1899 , but did not enter service until September 1903 , at a cost of ₣ 15 @,@ 660 @,@ 000 francs . The ship spent the early part of World War I as the guardship at Bizerte , until February 1915 when she was assigned to the newly formed Syrian Squadron ( escadre de Syrie ) . This squadron was intended to attack Turkish positions and lines of communication in Syria , Lebanon , Palestine and the Sinai Peninsula . Henri IV was transferred to the French squadron in the Dardanelles campaign to replace the sunk battleship Bouvet and the damaged Gaulois after the Allies suffered heavily during their first attempt to sail through the Dardanelles and past the fortifications them on 18 March 1915 . The ship bombarded Kum Kale , on the Asiatic side of the Dardanelles in support of the French diversionary landing on 25 April 1915 , and provided fire support for the troops ashore for the rest of the month . She was hit eight times while providing support during this time . 
 Three of her 138 @.@ 6 mm guns had been dismounted by November 1914 and sent to reinforce the French naval mission to Serbia , known as " Mission D " , by rail from Salonica . In 1916 , she was assigned to the Complementary ( Reserve ) Division of the 3rd Battle Squadron . Subsequently she served with the French Eastern Division in Egypt and then she was sent to Taranto in 1918 as a depot ship . Henri IV was stricken from the Navy List in 1920 and scrapped the following year . 
 = 2002 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 2002 Atlantic hurricane season was a slightly below average Atlantic hurricane season , officially starting on June 1 , 2002 and ending on November 30 , dates which conventionally limit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic Ocean . The season produced 14 tropical cyclones , of which 12 developed into named storms ; four became hurricanes , and two attained major hurricane status . The season officially began on June 1 , although the season 's first cyclone did not develop until July 14 . Despite the late start , the 2002 season tied with 2004 , 2007 , and 2010 in which a record number of tropical storms , eight , developed in the month of September . It ended early however , with no tropical storms forming after October 6 — a rare occurrence caused partly by El Niño conditions . The most intense hurricane of the season was Hurricane Isidore with a minimum central pressure of 934 mbar , although Hurricane Lili attained higher winds and peaked at Category 4 . The season 's low activity is reflected in the low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 67 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so low number reflects the small number of strong storms and preponderance of tropical storms . 
 The season was less destructive than average , causing an estimated $ 2 @.@ 6 billion ( 2002 USD ) in property damage and 23 fatalities . Most destruction was due to Isidore , which caused about $ 970 million ( 2002 USD , $ 1 @.@ 28 billion 2016 USD ) in damage and killed seven people in the Yucatán Peninsula and later the United States , and Hurricane Lili , which caused $ 860 million ( 2002 USD ) in damage and 15 deaths when it made landfall in Louisiana .

 Noted hurricane expert William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University issue forecasts of hurricane activity each year , separately from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) . Gray 's team determined the average number of storms per season between 1950 and 2000 to be 9 @.@ 6 tropical storms , 5 @.@ 9 hurricanes , and 2 @.@ 3 major hurricanes ( storms exceeding Category 3 ) . A normal season , as defined by NOAA , has 9 to 12 named storms , of which 5 to 7 reach hurricane strength and 1 to 3 become major hurricanes .

 On December 7 , 2001 , Gray 's team issued its first extended @-@ range forecast for the 2002 season , predicting above @-@ average activity ( 13 named storms , 8 hurricanes , and about 2 of Category 3 or higher ) . It listed an 86 percent chance of at least one major hurricane striking the U.S. mainland . This included a 58 percent chance of at least one major hurricane strike on the East Coast , including the Florida peninsula , and a 43 percent chance of at least one such strike on the Gulf Coast from the Florida Panhandle westward . The potential for major hurricane activity in the Caribbean was forecast to be above average . 
 On April 5 a new forecast was issued , calling for 12 named storms , 7 hurricanes and 3 intense hurricanes . The decrease in the forecast was attributed to the further intensification of El Niño conditions . The estimated potential for at least one major hurricane to affect the U.S. was decreased to 75 percent ; the East Coast potential decreased slightly to 57 percent , and from the Florida Panhandle westward to Brownsville , Texas , the probability remained the same . 
 = = = Mid @-@ season forecasts = = = 
 On August 7 , 2002 , Gray 's team lowered its season estimate to 9 named storms , with 4 becoming hurricanes and 1 becoming a major hurricane , noting that conditions had become less favorable for storms than they had been earlier in the year . The sea @-@ level pressure and trade wind strength in the tropical Atlantic were reported to be above normal , while sea surface temperature anomalies were on a decreasing trend . 
 On August 8 , 2002 , NOAA revised its season estimate to 7 – 10 named storms , with 4 – 6 becoming hurricanes and 1 – 3 becoming major hurricanes . The reduction was attributed to less favorable environmental conditions and building El Niño conditions .

 = = = Tropical Storm Arthur = = = 
 Arthur formed out of a tropical depression off the coast of North Carolina on July 14 from a decaying frontal zone . It then moved out to sea , strengthening slightly into a tropical storm on July 15 . Arthur gradually strengthened and peaked as a 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) tropical storm on the following day . However , cooler waters and upper level shear caused it to weaken . By July 17 , Arthur had become extratropical , and moved north over Newfoundland . It proceeded to weaken below gale strength . The precursor system produced up to 4 @.@ 49 in ( 114 mm ) of rainfall in Weston , Florida . Later , one person drowned in the <unk> River in Newfoundland due to Arthur . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Bertha = = = 
 A surface trough of low pressure that would later spawn Tropical Storm Cristobal developed a tropical depression in the northern Gulf of Mexico on August 4 . It quickly strengthened into a minimal tropical storm early on August 5 , and made landfall near Boothville , Louisiana just two hours later . Bertha weakened to a tropical depression , but retained its circulation over Louisiana . A high pressure system built southward , unexpectedly forcing the depression to the southwest . It emerged back over the Gulf of Mexico on August 7 , where proximity to land and dry air prevented further strengthening . Bertha moved westward , and made a second landfall near Kingsville , Texas on August 9 , having made no significant gain in strength . 
 Across the Gulf Coast of the United States , Bertha dropped light to moderate rainfall ; most areas received less than 3 inches ( 76 mm ) . Precipitation from the storm peaked at 10 @.@ 25 inches ( 260 mm ) in Norwood , Louisiana . Minor flooding was reported , which caused light damage to a few businesses , 15 to 25 houses , and some roadways . Overall , damage was very minor , totaling to $ 200 @,@ 000 ( 2002 USD , $ 263 thousand 2016 USD ) in damage . In addition , one death was reported due to Bertha , a drowning due to heavy surf in Florida . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Cristobal = = = 
 On August 5 , Tropical Depression Three formed off the coast of South Carolina from a surface trough of low pressure – the same trough that spawned Tropical Storm Bertha in the Gulf of Mexico . Under a southerly flow , the depression drifted southward , where dry air and wind shear inhibited significant development . On August 7 , it became Tropical Storm Cristobal , and reached a peak of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) on August 8 . The storm meandered eastward and was absorbed by a front on August 9 . 
 The interaction between the extratropical remnant and a high pressure system produced strong rip currents along the coastline of Long Island . The storm also caused waves of three to four ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) in height . Three people drowned from the rip currents and waves in New York . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Dolly = = = 
 A tropical wave exited the African coast on August 27 , and with low favorable conditions the system organized into Tropical Depression Four on August 29 about 630 mi ( 1 @,@ 020 km ) southwest of Cape Verde . Six hours later , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dolly after developing sufficient outflow and curved banding features . The storm continued to intensify as more convection developed , and Dolly reached peaked winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) on August 30 . After peaking in intensity , the storm suddenly lost organization , and the winds decreased to minimal tropical storm force . After a brief re @-@ intensification trend , Dolly again weakened due to wind shear . On September 4 Dolly weakened to a tropical depression , and later that day was absorbed by the trough ; it never affected land . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Edouard = = = 
 Edouard formed out of an area of disturbed weather north of the Bahamas on September 2 . It drifted northward , then executed a clockwise loop off the coast of Florida . Despite dry air and moderate upper level shear , Edouard strengthened to a peak of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) winds , but the unfavorable conditions caught up with it . The storm weakened as it turned west @-@ southwestward , and made landfall near Ormond Beach , Florida on September 5 as a minimal tropical storm . Edouard crossed Florida , and emerged over the Gulf of Mexico as a minimal depression . Outflow from the stronger Tropical Storm Fay caused Tropical Depression Edouard to weaken further , and Edouard was eventually absorbed by Fay . 
 Tropical Storm Edouard dropped moderate rainfall across Florida , peaking at 7 @.@ 64 inches ( 194 mm ) in DeSoto County . Though it was a tropical storm at landfall , winds were light across the path of the storm over land . Several roads were flooded from moderate precipitation . No casualties were reported , and damage was minimal . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Fay = = = 
 In early September , a low pressure center developed along a trough of low pressure , and on September 5 , the system had gained sufficient organization to be a tropical depression , to the southeast of Galveston . The depression drifted south @-@ southwest while strengthening into Tropical Storm Fay , reaching its peak strength of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) on the morning of September 6 . The system then abruptly turned to the west @-@ northwest , and remained steady in strength and course until landfall the next day , near Matagorda . It quickly degenerated into a remnant low , which itself moved slowly southwestward over Texas . The low eventually dissipated on September 11 over northeastern Mexico . 
 The storm brought heavy rainfall in Mexico and Texas . The storm also caused six tornadoes , up to 20 in ( 510 mm ) of rain , and extended periods of tropical storm force winds . The storm caused moderate flooding in some areas due to high rainfall amounts , which left about 400 homes with some form of damage . In total , 400 houses sustained damage from flooding . 1 @,@ 575 houses were damaged from the flooding or tornadic damage , 23 severely , amounting to $ 4 @.@ 5 million ( 2002 USD , $ 5 @.@ 92 million 2016 USD ) in damage . No deaths are attributed to Fay . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Seven = = = 
 A tropical wave exited Africa on September 1 , and after initial development became disorganized . It moved west @-@ northwestward for a week , reorganizing enough by September 7 to be declared Tropical Depression Seven about 1155 mi ( 1855 km ) east @-@ southeast of Bermuda . At the time , the depression had persistent convection around a small circulation , and it moved steadily westward due to a ridge to its north . Shortly after forming , strong wind shear diminished the convection and left the center partially exposed . By September 8 , there was no remaining thunderstorm activity , and the depression degenerated into a remnant low @-@ pressure area . The storm dissipated shortly after as strong wind shear continued to cause the storm to deteriorate while located 980 mi ( 1580 mi ) southeast of Bermuda . The depression never affected land . 
 = = = Hurricane Gustav = = = 
 An area of unsettled weather developed between the Bahamas and Bermuda on September 6 , and over the next few days convection increased in intensity and coverage . On September 8 , the system gained sufficient organization to be declared a subtropical depression off the Southeast United States coast ; later that day , the system was named Subtropical Storm Gustav . After attaining tropical characteristics on September 10 , Gustav passed slightly to the east of the Outer Banks of North Carolina as a tropical storm before moving northeastward and making two landfalls in Atlantic Canada as a Category 1 hurricane on September 12 . 
 The storm was responsible for one death and $ 100 @,@ 000 ( 2002 USD ) in damage , mostly in North Carolina . The interaction between Gustav and a non @-@ tropical system produced strong winds that caused an additional $ 240 @,@ 000 ( 2002 USD ) in damage in New England , but this damage was not directly attributed to the hurricane . In Atlantic Canada , the hurricane and its remnants brought heavy rain , tropical storm and hurricane @-@ force winds , as well as storm surges for several days . Localized flooding was reported in areas of Prince Edward Island , and 4 @,@ 000 people in Halifax , Nova Scotia and Charlottetown , Prince Edward Island were left without power . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Hanna = = = 
 In early September , a tropical wave merged with a trough of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico and spawned a low pressure system . Convection steadily deepened on September 11 east of the upper level low and the surface low ; it was classified as Tropical Depression Nine the next day . The disorganized storm moved westward , then northward , where it strengthened into Tropical Storm Hanna later that day . After reaching a peak with winds of 55 mph ( 90 km / h ) , it made two landfalls on the Gulf Coast , eventually dissipating on September 15 over Georgia . 
 Because most of the associated convective activity was east of the center of circulation , minimal damage was reported in Louisiana and Mississippi . To the east on Dauphin Island , Alabama , the storm caused coastal flooding which closed roads and forced the evacuation of residents . Florida received high wind gusts , heavy rainfall , and strong surf that resulted in the deaths of three swimmers . Throughout the state , 20 @,@ 000 homes lost electricity . The heavy rainfall progressed into Georgia , where significant flooding occurred . Crop damage was extensive , and over 300 structures were damaged by the flooding . The storm caused a total of about $ 20 million ( 2002 USD ) in damage and three fatalities . 
 = = = Hurricane Isidore = = = 
 On September 9 , a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa , and by September 14 it was classified as a tropical depression . The next day the storm was located just south of Jamaica , and it developed into Tropical Storm Isidore . On September 19 , it intensified into a hurricane , and Isidore made landfall in western Cuba as a Category 1 storm . Just before landfall near Puerto Telchac on September 22 , Isidore reached its peak intensity , with wind speeds of 125 miles per hour ( 201 km / h ) , making it a strong Category 3 storm . After returning to the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm , Isidore 's final landfall was near Grand Isle , Louisiana on September 26 , where the storm weakened to a depression . 
 Isidore made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula of southern Mexico as a Category 3 hurricane , leaving $ 640 million ( 2002 USD , $ 842 million 2016 USD ) in damage in the country . Despite dropping over 30 inches ( 760 mm ) of rainfall among other effects , only two indirect deaths were reported there . As a tropical storm , Isidore produced a maximum of 15 @.@ 97 inches ( 406 mm ) of rainfall in the United States at Metairie , Louisiana . The rainfall was responsible for flooding that caused moderate crop damage , with a total of $ 330 million in damage ( 2002 USD , $ 434 million 2016 USD ) . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Josephine = = = 
 A non @-@ tropical low developed along a dissipating stationary front on September 16 in the central Atlantic and drifted north @-@ northeastward . The National Hurricane Center classified it as Tropical Depression Eleven on September 17 about 710 mi ( 1 @,@ 150 km ) east of Bermuda , and initially the depression did not have significant deep convection . A wind report early on September 18 indicated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Josephine . The storm continued generally northeastward , steered between a subtropical high to the northeast and a frontal system approaching from the west . Josephine maintained a well @-@ defined circulation , but its deep convection remained intermittent . Early on September 19 the storm began being absorbed by the cold front , and as a tropical cyclone its winds never surpassed 40 mph ( 75 km / h ) . Later that day Josephine transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and suddenly intensified to winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . The extratropical low was quickly absorbed by another larger extratropical system on the afternoon of September 19 . 
 = = = Hurricane Kyle = = = 
 A non @-@ tropical low formed into Subtropical Depression Twelve , well east @-@ southeast of Bermuda on September 20 . It became Subtropical Storm Kyle the next day , and Tropical Storm Kyle on September 22 . Kyle drifted slowly westward , slowly strengthening , and reached hurricane strength on September 25 ; it weakened back into a tropical storm on September 28 . The cyclone 's strength continued to fluctuate between tropical depression and tropical storm several times . Its movement was also extremely irregular , as it shifted sharply north and south along its generally westward path . On October 11 , Kyle reached land and made its first landfall near McClellanville , South Carolina . While skirting the coastline of the Carolinas , it moved back over water , and made a second landfall near Long Beach , North Carolina later the same day . Kyle continued out to sea where it merged with a cold front on October 12 , becoming the fourth longest @-@ lived Atlantic hurricane . 
 Kyle brought light precipitation to Bermuda , but no significant damage was reported there . Moderate rainfall accompanied its two landfalls in the United States , causing localized flash flooding and road closures . Floodwaters forced the evacuation of a nursing home and several mobile homes in South Carolina . Kyle spawned at least four tornadoes , the costliest of which struck Georgetown , South Carolina ; it damaged 106 buildings and destroyed seven others , causing eight injuries . Overall damage totaled about $ 5 million ( 2002 USD , $ 6 @.@ 58 million 2016 USD ) , and no direct deaths were reported . However , the remnants of Kyle contributed to one indirect death in the British Isles . 
 = = = Hurricane Lili = = = 
 On September 16 , a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and across the Atlantic . It developed a low level cloud circulation midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles on September 20 . The next day , the system had become sufficiently organized to classify the system as a tropical depression about 900 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 700 km ) east of the Windward Islands . On September 30 Lili became a hurricane while passing over the Cayman Islands . The storm attained Category 4 status in the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall on the Louisiana coast on October 2 . The next day , it was absorbed by an extratropical low near the Tennessee – Arkansas border . 
 In Louisiana , wind gusts reaching 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) , coupled with over 6 inches ( 150 mm ) of rainfall and a storm surge of 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) , caused over $ 860 million ( 2002 USD , $ 1 @.@ 13 billion 2016 USD ) in damage . A total of 237 @,@ 000 people lost power , and oil rigs offshore were shut down for up to a week .

 A weak tropical wave moved through the Lesser Antilles on October 9 . As the system reached the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 12 , convection increased , and a broad low pressure area formed later that day . Over the next two days , the low significantly organized , and became Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200 UTC on October 14 . The depression initially tracked west @-@ northwestward , but then curved to the north @-@ northeast . Due to vertical wind shear , the depression was unable to intensify , and remained below tropical storm status during its duration . By 1600 UTC on October 16 , the depression made landfall near Cienfuegos , Cuba with winds of 30 mph ( 45 km / h ) . While crossing the island , the depression was absorbed by a cold front early on October 17 . Minimal impact was reported , which was limited to locally heavy rains over portions of Jamaica , Cuba , and the Cayman Islands .

 = Like a Virgin ( song ) = 
 " Like a Virgin " is a song by American singer Madonna . It is the title track from her second studio album Like a Virgin ( 1984 ) , and was released on November 6 , 1984 , by Sire Records as the first single from the album . The song appears on the greatest hits compilation albums The Immaculate Collection ( 1990 ) and Celebration ( 2009 ) . It was written by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly and produced by Nile Rodgers ; Steinberg said that the song was inspired by his personal experiences of romance . " Like a Virgin " was chosen for Madonna by Michael Ostin of Warner Bros. Records after listening to a demo sung by Kelly . However , Rodgers initially felt that the song did not have a sufficient hook and was not suitable for Madonna , but subsequently changed his opinion after the hook was stuck in his mind . 
 Musically " Like a Virgin " is a dance @-@ oriented song , composed of two hooks . Madonna 's voice is heard in a high register while a continuous arrangement of drums are heard along the bassline . The lyrics of the song are ambiguous and consist of hidden innuendo . In sexual terms , the lyrics can be interpreted in different ways for different people . " Like a Virgin " received positive reviews from contemporary as well as old critics , who frequently called it as one of the defining songs for Madonna . It became her first number @-@ one single on the Billboard Hot 100 , while reaching the top of the charts in Australia , Canada , and Japan , and the top @-@ ten of the other countries . 
 The music video portrayed Madonna sailing down the canals of Venice in a gondola , as well as roaming around a palace wearing a white wedding dress . With the video , scholars noted Madonna 's portrayal of a sexually independent woman , the symbolism of the appearance of a man with lion 's mask to that of Saint Mark , and the link between the eroticism of the video and the vitality of the city of Venice . Madonna has performed the song in six of her concert tours , most recent being the Rebel Heart Tour in 2015 . Most of the time , her performances of " Like a Virgin " were associated with strong reaction and uproar from the media . 
 " Like a Virgin " has been covered by a number of artists and has appeared in or been referenced in feature films such as Reservoir Dogs , Moulin Rouge ! and Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason . Family groups sought to ban it as they believed the song promoted sex without marriage . On the other hand , Madonna 's public persona of an indomitable , sexually unashamed , supremely confident woman was widely accepted by the younger generation who emulated her style and fashion . Scholars have credited " Like a Virgin " as the song which cemented her position as a pop culture icon . 
 = = Background = = 
 " Like a Virgin " was written by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly . In an interview with the Los Angeles Times , Steinberg explained that the song was not only not written for Madonna , it was not even written for a female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences . He elaborated : " I wasn 't just trying to get that racy word virgin in a lyric . I was saying ... that I may not really be a virgin — I 've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people — but I 'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good , it 's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I 've never done this before , because it 's so much deeper and more profound than anything I 've ever felt . " 
 Kelly recorded the demo , and invited Michael Ostin of Warner Bros. Records ' A & R department to his house to listen to it . Steinberg and Kelly played four or five tunes for Ostin , and further discussed " Like a Virgin " – they were not sure for which artist the song would be suitable . Due to meet with Madonna the next day to discuss her second album , Ostin intended on playing the demo to her , believing the lyrics and the groove of the song were perfect for Madonna . " When I played it for Madonna she went crazy , and knew instantly it was a song for her and that she could make a great record out of it , " Ostin recalled . In 2009 , Rolling Stone interviewer Austin Scaggs asked Madonna what her first impressions were after listening to the demos of " Like a Virgin " and " Material Girl " . Madonna replied : 
 I liked them both because they were ironic and provocative at the same time but also unlike me . I am not a materialistic person , and I certainly wasn 't a virgin , and , by the way , how can you be like a virgin ? I liked the play on words ; I thought they were clever . They 're so geeky , they 're cool . I never realised they would become my signature songs , especially the second one . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 In mid @-@ 1984 , Madonna met producer Nile Rodgers at the Power Station studios ( now Avatar Studios ) in New York . Rodgers initially did not want Madonna to record " Like a Virgin " , as he felt that the lyric ' like a virgin ' was not a terrific hook ; according to him it was not an all @-@ time catch phrase . Rogers dismissed the song after hearing the demo , which he thought sounded " really stupid and retarded " . Later , Rogers had second thoughts : " It 's weird because I couldn 't get it out of my head after I played it , even though I didn 't really like it . It sounded really bubble @-@ gummy to me , but it grew on me . I really started to like it . [ ... ] But , my first reaction to it was , ' This is really queer . ' " Rodgers credits Madonna with recognizing the song 's potential . He later said : " I handed my apology to Madonna and said , ' you know ... if it 's so catchy that it stayed in my head for four days , it must be something . So let 's do it . ' " Hence the song was finally recorded . Steinberg reflected on the recording process and commented that : 
 When Madonna recorded it , even as our demo faded out , on the fade you could hear Tom saying , " When your heart beats , and you hold me , and you love me ... " That was the last thing you heard as our demo faded . Madonna must have listened to it very , very carefully because her record ends with the exact same little ad @-@ libs that our demo did . That rarely happens that someone studies your demo so carefully that they use all that stuff . We were sort of flattered how carefully she followed our demo on that . 
 Jason Corsaro , the record 's audio engineer , persuaded Rodgers to use digital recording , a new technique at the time which Corsaro believed was going to be the future of recording because test pressings always sounded consistent . To ensure this , Corsaro used a Sony 3324 24 @-@ track digital tape recorder and a Sony F1 two @-@ track for the 12 @-@ bit mix . Madonna recorded the lead parts in a small , wooden , high @-@ ceilinged piano room at the back of Studio C , also known as Power Station 's " R & B room " . Corsaro then placed <unk> around her while using the top capsule of a stereo AKG <unk> tube microphone , with a Schoeps microphone preamplifier and a Pultec equalizer . Once the track met with everybody 's approval , Robert Sabino added the keyboard parts , playing mostly a Sequential Circuits Prophet @-@ 5 , as well as some Rhodes piano and acoustic piano , while Rodgers also played a Synclavier . Madonna , although not required , was present every minute of the recording sessions and the mixing process , Corsaro commented : " Nile was there most of the time , but she was there all of the time . She never left " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Composed as a dance @-@ oriented song , the intro of " Like a Virgin " consists of two hooks . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing , the song is set in common time , with a moderately dance @-@ groove tempo of 118 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of F major with Madonna 's voice ranging from the tonal nodes of low @-@ tone G3 to high @-@ tone C5 . According to Rikky Rooksby , the bassline on the intro is a re @-@ working of the three @-@ note bass motif present in the Four Tops ' 1965 song " I Can 't Help Myself ( Sugar Pie Honey Bunch ) " , where Chuck Berry provided the chord arrangement . The bassline also has some similarity with Michael Jackson 's " Billie Jean " especially during the second verse . Madonna sings the song in her high register while drum arrangement by Tony Thompson is heard alongside the bassline , which is also supported by a synthesizer arrangement , giving it a circular progression through all the seven diatonic chords of I – IV – <unk> – III – VI – II – V – I. 
 Regarding the lyrics , Madonna had commented : " I like innuendo , I like irony , I like the way things can be taken on different levels . " This statement highlighted the ambiguity of the lyrics of the song , which is hung on the word ' like ' . Rooksby interpreted the meaning of the song in different ways to different people . He said that for women who were really virgins , the song encouraged them to hold their compose before they engaged in their very first sexual act . For sexually experienced girls , the song meant that they would be able to re @-@ live the feelings of their first sexual encounter all over again . For the boys , the song presented a narcissistic image of them making the girl forget her past encounters and enjoy the sexual act as if for the first time . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " Like a Virgin " is one of Madonna 's most famous singles , and was met with predominantly positive critical reception . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic said that " Like a Virgin " was a definitive statement . He added that the song , and " Material Girl " from the same album , made Madonna an icon . He added that both overshadowed the rest of the record , " because they are a perfect match of theme and sound . " Debbie Miller from Rolling Stone commented that Madonna 's voice " doesn 't have the power or range of , say , Cyndi Lauper , but she knows what works on the dance floor . " In 2014 , Ryan Reed , also writing for Rolling Stone , called the song a " classic " . 
 Dave Karger from Entertainment Weekly , while reviewing the album in 1995 , felt that the song came off a bit repetitious and immature when compared to the present context . Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly felt that the song raised the " madonna @-@ whore " ante . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called the song a classic . Alfred Soto from Stylus Magazine felt that the song was chic in its style . Katie Henderson from The Guardian commented that the song was saucy in nature . Michael Paoletta from Billboard commented that the song sustained a " fevered dance @-@ rock momentum . " 
 In 2000 , " Like a Virgin " , was honored by Rolling Stone and MTV , as the fourth song on their list of the " 100 Greatest Pop Songs " . It was voted ten on VH1 's 100 Best Songs of the Past 25 Years . The song was listed at ninety @-@ five on Billboard Hot 100 All @-@ Time Top Songs .

 The music video , directed by Mary Lambert , who worked with Madonna in her video for " Borderline " , was shot in Venice , Italy and partly in New York City in July 1984 . Madonna was portrayed as a knowing virgin , a figment of the pornographic mind , as she walked through marble rooms , wearing a wedding gown . It alternated with scenes of a provocative @-@ looking Madonna on board a gondola . She commented , " [ Mary ] wanted me to be the modern @-@ day , worldly @-@ wise girl that I am . But then we wanted to go back in time and use myself as an actual virgin . " The video starts with Madonna boarding on a boat from the Brooklyn Bridge and travels to Venice . As she steps down into the city , she moves like a stripper and undulated sinuously . She wears a black dress and blue pants with a number of Christian symbol embedded jewelry around her neck . She sings the song at full volume as she watches a lion walking between the columns of the Piazza San Marco of Venice and along the statute of Saint Mark . 
 A number of game @-@ playing involving carnival masks , men , lions , <unk> are portrayed with allusions to eighteenth @-@ century practices and Saint Mark . Sheila Whiteley , author of Women and popular music : sexuality , identity , and subjectivity , felt that Madonna 's image signified a denial of sexual knowledge , but also portrayed her in simulated writhing on a gondola , thus underpinning the simulation of deceit . The intrusion of a male lion , confirmed the underlying bestial discourse of both mythological fairy tale and pornographic sex . Whiteley observed that in the video , Madonna 's lover wears the lion 's mask and while cavorting with him , Madonna sheds the veneer of innocence and shows her propensity for wild animal passions . Having instilled desire , metaphorically she turns her lover into a Beast . Madonna commented about shooting with the lion : 
 " The lion didn 't do anything he was supposed to do , and I ended up leaning against this pillar with his head in my crotch ... I thought he was going to take a bite out of me so I lifted the veil I was wearing and had a stare @-@ down with him and he opened his mouth and let out this huge roar . I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe . When he finally walked away , the director yelled ' Cut ' and I had to take a long breather . But I could really relate to the lion . I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something . "

 With the video , scholars noted the expression of Venetian vitality in it . Author Margaret Plant ( 2002 ) commented : " With the lion of Saint Mark and the virginal city to the forefront , old sacrosanct Venice was propelled into a pop world of high @-@ energy gyration , and endless circulation . " She also noted that Saint Mark was a symbol of a time when sexual crime was punished severely in Venice and acts of rape , homosexuality and fornication incurred the loss of a nose , a hand or sometimes life itself . Madonna appeared to challenge such brutality and stretch the boundaries of tolerance in the video . As the lion @-@ man carried Madonna to the Venetian palace , it symbolized an instance of the Saint taking the simulated Virgin , where Madonna became a symbol for La Serenissima , the Republic itself . 
 Plant also noted that Madonna , in the video , restored the energy and eroticism of Venice , which had its name taken from Venus in familiar elision . As she exchanged her blue top for a black one during the video , Madonna demonstrated her mastery and bravery of the city , which had a reputation of turning out its visitors as victims . Carol Clerk ( 2002 ) commented that with the video , " Madonna 's days as a cheap and cheerful video star were over . She was moving into serious spectacle . " 
 In 1985 , a live music video of " Like a Virgin " from The Virgin Tour filmed in Detroit , was used to promote Madonna Live : The Virgin Tour video release . This version was nominated for Best Choreography at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards . The live performance of " Like a Virgin " from the Blond Ambition World Tour in Paris , France was released as a music video on May 9 , 1991 to promote the documentary film Truth or Dare . This version was nominated for two awards at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards in the categories of Best Female Video and Best Choreography . This video was ranked at position sixty @-@ one on VH1 's 100 Greatest Videos .

 Madonna performed " Like a Virgin " at the first MTV Video Music Awards in 1984 , where she appeared on stage atop a giant wedding cake dressed in a wedding dress , adorned with the infamous " Boy Toy " belt buckle , and veil . The climax of her risqué performance found her " humping " and rolling around on the stage . To this day , the performance is noted as one of the most iconic and biggest performances in MTV 's history . 
 The song has also been included in seven of Madonna 's ten concert tours . For The Virgin Tour in 1985 , Madonna again donned wedding attire and performed a straight version of the song featuring a quotation from Michael Jackson 's similar @-@ sounding Motown @-@ style single , " Billie Jean " . Balloons floated out towards the audience as she rolled around the stage , carrying a wedding bouquet in her hand . The performance was included in the VHS release Madonna Live : The Virgin Tour recorded in Detroit , Michigan . In the 1987 Who 's That Girl World Tour , the song was given a lighthearted comedic theme and included quotations from The Four Tops ' " I Can 't Help Myself ( Sugar Pie Honey Bunch ) " . Madonna took off her outfit piece by piece , until she was standing in a black corset , and ended the performance while flirting with a young male dancer who played her bridegroom . Two different performances of the song on this tour can be found on the videos : Who 's That Girl : Live in Japan , filmed in Tokyo , Japan , on June 22 , 1987 , and Ciao Italia : Live from Italy , filmed in Turin , Italy , on September 4 , 1987 . 
 For the 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour , the song was re @-@ invented with a middle @-@ eastern arrangement and risqué choreography which found Madonna wearing a gold corset , while simulating masturbation on a red silk bed , accompanied by two male dancers who wore the infamous cone bras designed by Jean @-@ Paul Gaultier . The performance garnered a lot of attention , particularly when police in Toronto , Canada , threatened to arrest Madonna and charge her with indecency unless she altered the performance . Madonna refused and the show went ahead unaltered . The threatened arrest failed to materialise . Two different performances were taped and released on video , the Blond Ambition : Japan Tour 90 , taped in Yokohama , Japan , on April 27 , 1990 , and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live , taped in Nice , France , on August 5 , 1990 . During The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993 , Madonna wore a tuxedo and adopted a Marlene Dietrich @-@ like persona , singing the song with a thick German accent . She sang the word ' virgin ' as ' ( w ) <unk> ' , while including a quotation from Dietrich 's signature tune , " Falling in Love Again ( Can 't Help It ) " . The overplayed accent and three @-@ quarter time signature gave the performance a sense of parody . Dietrich 's look in the 1930 film Morocco inspired the whole performance . The performance was included on The Girlie Show : Live Down Under home video release , recorded on November 19 , 1993 at Sydney , Australia . 
 In April 2003 , while promoting her ninth studio album American Life , an impromptu acoustic performance of the song was done by Madonna at New York 's Tower Records . Madonna 's performance of " Hollywood " at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards recreated the 1984 performance of " Like a Virgin " . The performance started with Britney Spears emerging from a giant cake singing the first few lines . She was later joined by Christina Aguilera and both of them writhed on the stage while singing . Madonna appeared on the cake dressed as a groom and sang " Hollywood " , and ultimately kissed both Spears and Aguilera on the mouth . The performance was met with strong reaction from media . 
 During the Confessions Tour in 2006 , the song was given a horse riding theme . Madonna wore a tight , black body suit , and performed the song atop a studded leather S & M carousel horse , while X @-@ rays of her broken bones , the result of a horse @-@ riding accident on her forty @-@ seventh birthday , flashed on the screens behind her . The performance was included on The Confessions Tour live album , released in 2007 . In 2008 's Sticky & Sweet Tour , Madonna sang the song in Rome and dedicated the song to Pope Benedict XVI , commenting " I 'd like to dedicate this song to the Pope , I know he loves me " and saying that she is a child of God . She asked the audience to sing along with her . The song was again performed on The MDNA Tour ( 2012 ) , during the third section of the show . " Like a Virgin " was stripped down to a simple Burlesque @-@ version played on the piano , featuring elements of the soundtrack " Evgeni 's Waltz " from the film , W.E. On the Rebel Heart Tour ( 2015 ) , a bass @-@ heavy version of " Like a Virgin " ended the second act of the show . Jim Farber of Daily News described it as the show 's " most stunning move " , adding that " [ Madonna ] appeared on the gaping stage entirely alone , dancing with a freedom and innocence that made her , at 57 , seem once again new . "

 In 1985 , The Lords of the New Church recorded " Like a Virgin " for their compilation album Killer Lords . Gary Hill from Allmusic called the composition as " very funny and obnoxious " . The same year , " Weird Al " Yankovic parodied the song with his single " Like a Surgeon " from the album Dare to Be Stupid . Eugene Chadbourne from Allmusic commented : " Turning the tacky Madonna hit inside out and upside down , Yankovic comes up with a hilarious satire of the medical profession . " In 1991 , Glaswegian band Teenage Fanclub covered " Like a Virgin " on their second album , The King . The song also appears on the soundtrack of the 2001 film Moulin Rouge ! and is sung by the characters Harold <unk> , played by Jim Broadbent , and The Duke of <unk> , played by Richard Roxburgh . In 2004 , The Meat <unk> covered the song in a bluegrass medley , pairing it with Madonna 's " Lucky Star " and " Burning Up . " 
 In the 2004 film Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason , the title character teaches the song to women in a Thai prison , after becoming annoyed that they are singing the song badly . She tells them , " Madonna is nothing if not a perfectionist ! " In one of the episodes of the TV show Grey 's Anatomy , the character of Cristina Yang hums the song during surgery to take the focus off herself . However , when her assisting surgery , Lexie Grey starts singing along , Christina looks <unk> at her until she quiets down . Katy Perry , Travis Barker and DJ AM covered the song at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards . In 2009 , the song was namechecked in the Train hit single " Hey , Soul Sister " with the lyric " I believe in you / Like a virgin you 're Madonna / And I 'm always gonna wanna blow your mind " . The song was covered in the 2010 Glee episode " The Power of Madonna " by the cast , including Jonathan Groff , Jayma Mays , Lea Michele , Cory Monteith , Matthew Morrison , and Naya Rivera , during a dream sequence by their characters . The same year , Elton John performed a cover version of " Like a Virgin " at the Rainforest Fund Benefit Concert . 
 On September 9 , 2011 , Vanessa Carlton posted a link to a snippet of her stripped @-@ down cover of the song in her Twitter account . In 2012 Korean girl group 2NE1 released a cover of the song for their debut Japanese album Collection .

 " Like a Virgin " is listed in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 's list of " 500 Songs That Shaped Rock And Roll " . After the song and its video were released , " Like a Virgin " attracted the attention of family organizations who complained that the video and the song , promoted sex without marriage and undermined family values , offering an unsavoury image of Madonna as a whore . Outraged moralists condemned her as a sex kitten and sought to ban the song and the video . Conservatives were angered that Madonna dared to portray religious symbolism and the virginal wedding attire in a sexual context . Clerk noted the song attracted an unprecedented level of attention from social groups compared to any female singer 's song . " The main problem was that most of them listened superficially to the lyric of the song , imagining that it detailed or called on an innocent 's sexual initiation . " While one section of the population were outraged at the scandal , others were taking joy at the very notion of a virginal Madonna , who retorted by saying , 
 I was surprised by how people reacted to " Like a Virgin " because when I did that song , to me , I was singing about how something made me feel a certain way – brand @-@ new and fresh – and everyone interpreted it as I don 't want to be a virgin anymore . Fuck my brains out ! That 's not what I sang at all . " Like a Virgin " was always absolutely ambiguous . 
 Biographer Andrew Morton noted that most of Madonna 's admirers were females , who were born @-@ and @-@ brought @-@ up with an image of old @-@ fashioned stereotypes of women as virginal brides , or as whores , or with feminist values that rejected the use of a woman 's looks for her self @-@ advancement . Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay : an anthology commented that with the song , Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time . He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie . McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle @-@ class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her , which was having equal opportunity . She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships , but also enjoy them . 
 In addition , according to Morton , at a time when eighties fashions were promoting flat @-@ chested , stick @-@ thin women as ideals of beauty , the more curvaceous Madonna made average girls feel that it was fine to be in the shape they were . A new word called ' Madonna wannabe ' was introduced to describe the thousands of girls who tried to emulate Madonna 's style . University professors , gender @-@ studies experts and feminists earnestly started discussing her role as a post @-@ modernist style and cultural icon . According to author Debbi Voller , " Like a Virgin " gave rise to the icon Madonna . 
 In the opening scene of the 1992 film Reservoir Dogs , written and directed by Quentin Tarantino , Mr. Brown ( played by Tarantino himself ) insists that " Like a Virgin " is a " metaphor for big dicks " . When Madonna met Tarantino at a party after the film was released , she gave him an autographed copy of her Erotica album , signing " Quentin : it 's about love , not dick " .

 = PSR B1620 @-@ 26 b = 
 PSR B1620 @-@ 26 b is an extrasolar planet located approximately 12 @,@ 400 light @-@ years away from Earth in the constellation of Scorpius . It bears the unofficial nicknames " Methuselah " and " the Genesis planet " due to its extreme age and a few popular sources refer to this object as " PSR B1620 @-@ 26 c " ( see below for discussion ) . The planet is in a circumbinary orbit around the two stars of PSR B1620 @-@ 26 ( which are a pulsar ( PSR B1620 @-@ 26 A ) and a white dwarf ( WD B1620 @-@ 26 ) ) and is the first circumbinary planet ever confirmed . It is also the first planet found in a globular cluster . The planet is one of the oldest known extrasolar planets , believed to be about 12 @.@ 7 billion years old . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 = = = Mass , orbit , and age = = = 
 PSR has a mass of 2 @.@ 5 times that of Jupiter , and orbits at a distance of 23 AU ( 3 @.@ 4 billion km ) , a little larger than the distance between Uranus and the Sun . Each orbit of the planet takes about 100 years . 
 The triple system is just outside the core of the globular cluster Messier 4 . The age of the cluster has been estimated to be about 12 @.@ 7 billion years , and because all stars in a cluster form at about the same time , and planets form together with their host stars , it is likely that PSR B1620 @-@ 26 b is also about 12 @.@ 7 billion years old . This is much older than any other known planet , and nearly three times as old as Earth . It has been undergoing many stages through its lifetime . 
 = = = Host stars = = = 
 PSR B1620 @-@ 26 b orbits a pair of stars . The primary star , PSR B1620 @-@ 26 , is a pulsar , a neutron star spinning at 100 revolutions per second . The second is a white dwarf with a mass of 0 @.@ 34 M ☉ . These stars orbit each other at a distance of 1 AU about once every six months . The age of the system is 12 @.@ 7 to 13 billion years old , making this one of the oldest binary stars known . In comparison , the Sun has an age of 4 @.@ 6 billion years . 
 The binary system 's apparent magnitude , or how bright it appears from Earth 's perspective , is 24 . It is far too dim to be seen with the naked eye . 
 = = = Evolutionary history = = = 
 The origin of this pulsar planet is still uncertain , but it probably did not form where it is found today . Because of the decreased gravitational force when the core of star collapses to a neutron star and ejects most of its mass in a supernova explosion , it is unlikely that a planet could remain in orbit after such an event . It is more likely that the planet formed in orbit around the star that has now evolved into the white dwarf , and that the star and planet were only later captured into orbit around the neutron star . 
 Stellar encounters are not very common in the disk of the Milky Way , where the Sun is , but in the dense core of globular clusters they occur frequently . At some point during the 10 billion years , the neutron star is thought to have encountered and captured the host star of the planet into a tight orbit , probably losing a previous companion star in the process . About half a billion years ago , the newly captured star began to expand into a red giant ( see stellar evolution ) . 
 Typical pulsar periods for young pulsars are of the order of one second , and they increase with time ; the very short periods exhibited by so @-@ called millisecond pulsars are due to the transfer of material from a binary companion . The pulse period of PSR B1620 @-@ 26 is a few milliseconds , providing strong evidence for matter transfer . It is believed that as the pulsar 's red giant companion expanded , it filled and then exceeded its Roche lobe , so that its surface layers started being transferred onto the neutron star . 
 The infalling matter produced complex and spectacular effects . The infalling matter ' spun up ' the neutron star , due to the transfer of angular momentum , and for a few hundred million years , the stars formed a low @-@ mass X @-@ ray binary , as the infalling matter was heated to temperatures high enough to glow in X @-@ rays . 
 Mass transfer came to an end when the surface layers of the mass @-@ losing star were depleted , and the core slowly shrunk to a white dwarf . Now the stars peacefully orbit around each other . The long @-@ term prospects for PSR B1620 @-@ 26 b are poor , though . The triple system , which is much more massive than a typical isolated star in M4 , is slowly drifting down into the core of the cluster , where the density of stars is very high . In a billion years or so , the triple will probably have another close encounter with a nearby star . The most common outcome of such encounters is that the lightest companion is ejected from the multiple star system . If this happens , PSR B1620 @-@ 26 b will most likely be ejected completely from M4 , and will spend the rest of its existence wandering alone in interstellar space as an interstellar planet . 
 = = Detection and discovery = = 
 Like nearly all extrasolar planets discovered prior to 2008 , PSR B1620 @-@ 26 b was originally detected through the Doppler shifts its orbit induces on radiation from the star it orbits ( in this case , changes in the apparent pulsation period of the pulsar ) . In the early 1990s , a group of astronomers led by Donald Backer were studying what they thought was a binary pulsar , determined that a third object was needed to explain the observed Doppler shifts . Within a few years , the gravitational effects of the planet on the orbit of the pulsar and white dwarf had been measured , giving an estimate of the mass of the third object that was too small for it to be a star . The conclusion that the third object was a planet was announced by Stephen <unk> and his collaborators in 1993 . 
 The study of the planetary orbit allowed the mass of the white dwarf star to be estimated as well , and theories of the formation of the planet suggested that the white dwarf should be young and hot . On July 10 , 2003 , the detection of the white dwarf and confirmation of its predicted properties were announced by a team led by <unk> Sigurdsson , using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope . It was at a NASA press briefing that the name Methuselah was introduced , capturing press attention around the world . 
 = = Name = = 
 While the designation PSR B1620 @-@ 26 b is not used in any scientific papers , the planet is listed in the SIMBAD database as PSR B1620 @-@ 26 b . Some popular sources use the designation PSR B1620 @-@ 26 c to refer to the planet , as it was described as the third member of a triple system ( composed of the planet and two stars ) . This designation doesn 't appear in the SIMBAD database , and more modern naming conventions use a separated lettering system where lower @-@ case letters to refer to planets and upper @-@ case letters to designate stars ( e.g. Gliese <unk> c is the ' c ' planet orbiting Gliese <unk> , which is the ' C ' star of a triple system ) , making PSR B1620 @-@ 26 b the designation for a planet orbiting both stars of the PSR B1620 @-@ 26 system . Neither usage is employed in the scientific literature with respect to the PSR B1620 @-@ 26 planet . 
 Though not officially recognized , the name " Methuselah " is commonly used for the planet in popular articles . The name comes from the biblical person Methuselah ( who in Christian mythology was the oldest person who ever lived ) . This name is usually used as the informal name to show the similarities to the planets of the solar system , while the " latter name " is used astronomically . Methuselah is the only planet to have received a biblical name , although three additional extrasolar planets have been given mythological names ( just like in the Solar System ) , those planets being Bellerophon , Zarmina and Osiris . 
 = Bad Words ( film ) = 
 Bad Words is a 2013 American black comedy film directed by Jason Bateman and written by Andrew Dodge . Marking Bateman 's directorial debut , the film stars Bateman as a middle @-@ aged eighth grade dropout who enters the National Golden Quill Spelling Bee through a loophole . It also stars Kathryn Hahn , Rohan Chand , Ben Falcone , Philip Baker Hall , and Allison Janney . 
 Dodge 's screenplay for Bad Words was featured on the 2011 Black List and was shortly thereafter picked up by Bateman . In the original script , the story was set at the Scripps National Spelling Bee , but the name was changed to a fictional bee since the filmmakers did not expect Scripps to allow the use of their name in the film . After two other actors declined to play the main character , Bateman decided to take on the role himself , and cast the other roles by a combination of contacting friends and open casting calls . Filming took place in Los Angeles at the end of 2012 . 
 The film premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival on September 6 , 2013 , and had a limited release in the United States on March 14 , 2014 , expanding to a wide release on March 28 . Produced for $ 10 million , it earned $ 7 @.@ 8 million at the theatrical box office . It received mixed to positive reviews from critics : some enjoyed the humor and direction , while others found the main character unlikeable and the humor offensive . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Forty @-@ year @-@ old Guy Trilby discovers a loophole in the Golden Quill Spelling Bee which stipulates that participants must have not graduated from the eighth grade , allowing him to enter since he dropped out of middle school . He attends and wins a regional spelling bee , and progresses to the national competition after confrontations with both the parents of children and the spelling bee hosts . He is accompanied by Jenny Widgeon , a relatively unknown journalist hoping to make a story out of his participation in the bee . On the flight to the national spelling bee , Guy meets Chaitanya Chopra , a 10 @-@ year @-@ old entrant in the bee who persistently attempts to befriend Guy . Upon his arrival in Los Angeles , Guy meets the director of the spelling bee , Dr. Bernice Deagan , who expresses anger at his participation in the bee and places him and his reporter in a cheap hotel . Guy learns that Chaitanya is staying in the same hotel , and takes him out one night to expose Chaitanya to the wilder side of life : stealing food , drinking , and briefly hiring a prostitute . 
 In the bee , Guy actively tries to distract and disconcert his fellow competitors , at one point insinuating that he was sleeping with another contestant 's mother . Despite Dr. Deagan 's tampering with the word list to give Guy the most difficult words , he spells long , complicated words with relative ease , impressing and angering both parents and staff at the spelling bee , including the event 's founder , Dr. William Bowman . However , the parents petition for his disqualification and the resignation of Deagan . While researching Guy 's background , Jenny discovers that Bowman is Guy 's father . She reveals this to him and he admits that his prime motivation for entering the bee was to embarrass his father in revenge for abandoning him and his mother when he was a child . Soon before the final stage of the bee , Guy overhears Chaitanya and his father discussing his strategy to win , which is to befriend Guy so that he will allow Chaitanya to win out of guilt . Guy storms into the room and ends his friendship with Chaitanya , despite Chaitanya 's pleas that he genuinely wanted to be friends . They later sabotage each other : Guy burns Chaitanya 's study book , " Todd , " and Chaitanya calls the LAPD and accuses Guy of kidnapping a young girl . 
 Meanwhile , only ten competitors remain in the bee , and the pool is gradually reduced to just Guy and Chaitanya . When a contestant 's mother attacks Guy verbally and is subdued by the police on live television , Bowman is forced to intervene , to his embarrassment . Having accomplished his goal , Guy deliberately misspells a word in an effort to let Chaitanya win . To prove his friendship , Chaitanya also misspells his word , and they soon begin to argue . This escalates into a physical fight , and when Bowman attempts to intervene , Chaitanya accidentally hits him with a chair . Although the bee is briefly halted , Bowman allows it to continue after deciding that both Guy and Chaitanya acted in an equally embarrassing manner . Their standoff of deliberately misspelling words continues until Guy intentionally misspells Chaitanya 's word so that Chaitanya corrects him , thus causing Chaitanya to win the bee inadvertently . As Guy leaves , content , Chaitanya offers to give him half the winnings and names him co @-@ winner of the bee . Guy writes a note to Bowman explaining his actions and returns home . He resolves his conflict with Chaitanya by buying an old police car from an auction with his share of the winnings , and helping Chaitanya to chase down his school bullies .

 Andrew Dodge 's screenplay for Bad Words first received attention after its inclusion on the 2011 Black List , an annual survey of the best unproduced screenplays in Hollywood . The script was sent to actor Jason Bateman , who had asked his agent to pursue directorial work , explaining that being able to direct films was " really the only reason I 've been acting for the last 20 years of this career " . 
 After Bateman signed on to direct the film , he and Dodge spent a long time revising the script , particularly adjusting parts where the dark humor " went a little bit too far " . In the original script , the story was intended to take place at the Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington , D.C. The setting was changed to the fictional Golden Quill Spelling Bee in Los Angeles since Bateman did not expect to receive permission from Scripps to use their name in the film . 
 = = = Pre @-@ production = = = 
 Bateman did not initially intend to star in the film , but after approaching two other actors who turned down the role of Guy , he decided to play the main character himself . He felt that it would be easier to play the role himself than to direct another actor to strike the " tricky tone " required , and to ensure that the character remained likeable despite his bad qualities . Allison Janney and Kathryn Hahn were already friends of Bateman 's before making Bad Words , so Bateman simply asked them to star in the film rather than going through a regular casting process . Bateman also reached out to Philip Baker Hall , whom he admired and thought " would lend a great deal of pedigree to the film " , to offer him a role . Child actor Rohan Chand sent in a taped audition in response to a casting call for 10 @-@ year @-@ old Indian boys , and was cast as Chaitanya after talking to Bateman through Skype . Bateman drew from his own experiences as a child actor in directing Chand and tried to minimize Chand 's exposure to the film 's " off @-@ color material " and nudity .

 The production of Bad Words began in 2012 with a budget of US $ 10 million , financed by MXN Entertainment and Darko Entertainment . Principal photography took place over 29 days at the end of 2012 in Los Angeles , with the Sportsman 's Lodge in the San Fernando Valley serving as the location of the national spelling bee final . It was filmed on an Arri Alexa camera by cinematographer Ken Seng , who drew inspiration from the 2002 romantic comedy Punch @-@ Drunk Love in shooting a film that was " lit darker than a comedy normally would be " .

 Bad Words received mixed reviews from critics . The film currently holds a 65 % rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 121 reviews , with an average rating of 6 @.@ 2 / 10 . The site 's consensus states : " <unk> funny and gleefully amoral , Bad Words boasts one of Jason Bateman 's best performances — and proves he 's a talented director in the bargain . " On Metacritic , the film holds a score of 57 out of 100 , based on 36 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . 
 Positive reviews for the film praised its script , direction and acting . Writing for Entertainment Weekly , Owen Gleiberman gave Bad Words a grade of A − , praising Dodge 's script and Bateman 's direction , and describing the film as a " balancing act between <unk> funny hatred and humanity " . Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times awarded the film 3 @.@ 5 out of 4 stars , calling it " near @-@ perfect " , " brilliant , uncompromising and wickedly funny " . Variety 's Justin Chang commended Bateman 's directorial debut and the film 's " often uproarious model of sharp scripting and spirited acting " , as well as the performances given by Chand , Hahn and Hall . Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers gave Bad Words 3 @.@ 5 out of 4 stars , writing that the film was " a tour de force of comic wickedness " in which " Bateman shows the same skill as a filmmaker that he does as an actor " . John DeFore opined in a review for The Hollywood Reporter that the film was " <unk> funny " and that Bateman showed " the same knack for timing and fine shadings of attitude " as both the director and the lead actor . The Los Angeles Times ' Betsy Sharkey enjoyed Bad Words , summarizing it as " high @-@ minded , foul @-@ mouthed good nonsense " and " sarcastic , sanctimonious , salacious , sly , slight and surprisingly sweet " . 
 Negative reviews , on the other hand , mainly criticized the film 's dark humor and the <unk> of the main character . USA Today 's Claudia Puig found the film " neither believable nor funny " and wrote that " it 's tough to summon sufficiently negative language to describe the unfunny , desperate mess that is Bad Words " . The Boston Globe critic Peter Keough gave the film 1 star out of 4 , finding it unfunny , clichéd and offensive with an unlikeable " sociopath " as the main character . Richard Corliss of Time thought that the film failed to redeem Guy 's character or justify his " deification " , ultimately making it boring and unsatisfying . Similarly , Joe Morgenstern described Guy in a review for The Wall Street Journal as " downright vile , a self @-@ created pariah , and funny enough for a reasonable stretch of time " before the plot becomes " both implausible and banal " . The Globe and Mail 's Robert Everett @-@ Green gave Bad Words 1 out of 4 stars , deeming it " a shallow remix " of offensive and clichéd characters with poor acting and " mean @-@ spirited " humor . 
 = ? Oryzomys pliocaenicus = 
 ? Oryzomys pliocaenicus is a fossil rodent from the <unk> ( late Miocene ) of Kansas , central United States . It is known from a single mandible ( lower jaw ) with the back part missing . All three molars are present , but very worn . Together , the molars are 3 @.@ 6 mm long . The fossil was discovered in 1935 and described in 1939 as a possible species of Oryzomys ( in open nomenclature ) . Later authors doubted this allocation and suggested that it may instead belong in Bensonomys or Jacobsomys , but the material may not allow a definite identification . 
 = = Discovery and context = = 
 The only known specimen of ? Oryzomys pliocaenicus is a mandible ( lower jaw ) found in the spring of 1935 by David Dunkle in Edson Quarry , Sherman County , Kansas . It is in the collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University as specimen MCZ <unk> . Edson Quarry is in the Ogallala Formation and the <unk> North American Land Mammal Age . Claude W. Hibbard described the mandible as ? Oryzomys pliocaenicus in a 1939 paper . Hibbard wrote that the fauna was middle Pliocene , but it is now considered Miocene . The Edson Quarry fauna contains a diversity of other fossils , including mammals , birds , reptiles , and amphibians . 
 = = Description = = 
 ? Oryzomys pliocaenicus is known from a single mandible with the incisor and three molars in it . Much of the back of the jaw is missing , including the angular , condyloid , and coronoid processes . The mental foramen , a foramen ( opening ) at the front of the jaw , in the diastema between the incisor and molars , opens upwards , a little more so than in the living marsh rice rat ( Oryzomys palustris ) . The masseteric ridges , which anchor some of the chewing muscles and are located on the outer surface of the mandible , are similar to those of Oryzomys . The molars are very worn , so that only traces of the cusps remain ; no accessory small cusps are visible . Each of the teeth has two roots . The length of the toothrow is 3 @.@ 6 mm and the depth of the mandible below the first molar is also 3 @.@ 6 mm . 
 = = Interpretations = = 
 Hibbard wrote that the condition of the mental foramen and masseteric ridges excluded the specimen from <unk> , Peromyscus , <unk> , and <unk> and that in these features and in its depth and size , the fossil more closely resembled Oryzomys ; therefore , he placed it in that genus with a query . Oryzomys is a living genus that has occurred in the United States since at least 300 @,@ 000 years ago . In 1966 , Philip Hershkovitz wrote that Hibbard had reconsidered his opinion after re @-@ examining ? O. pliocaenicus in 1952 ; he no longer thought that it was an Oryzomys and instead believed it may be a Bensonomys . The latter genus occurs in the late Miocene and early Pliocene of North America and has been variously interpreted as a close relative of the South American Calomys or merely as an evolutionarily convergent member of the North American subfamily <unk> . Jon Baskin mentioned the animal in 1978 and 1986 , asserting that it cannot be identified to genus level , but may be Bensonomys . Although some continue to list it under Oryzomys , it is now usually excluded from the genus . In 2008 , Everett Lindsay listed ? O. pliocaenicus as a questionable species of Jacobsomys , a Pliocene North American genus which he said may be ancestral to Oryzomys . 
 = Cumulus cloud = 
 <unk> means " heap " or " pile " in Latin . Cumulus clouds are often described as " puffy " , " cotton @-@ like " or " fluffy " in appearance , and have flat bases . Cumulus clouds , being low @-@ level clouds , are generally less than 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) in altitude unless they are the more vertical cumulus congestus form . Cumulus clouds may appear by themselves , in lines , or in clusters . 
 Cumulus clouds are often precursors of other types of cloud , such as cumulonimbus , when influenced by weather factors such as instability , moisture , and temperature gradient . Normally , cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation , but they can grow into the precipitation @-@ bearing congestus or cumulonimbus clouds . Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapor , supercooled water droplets , or ice crystals , depending upon the ambient temperature . They come in many distinct <unk> , and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation . Cumulus clouds are part of the larger category of free @-@ convective cumuliform clouds , which include cumulonimbus clouds . The latter genus @-@ type is sometimes categorized separately as <unk> due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top . There are also cumuliform clouds of limited convection that comprise stratocumulus ( low @-@ étage ) , altocumulus ( middle @-@ étage ) and cirrocumulus . ( high @-@ étage ) . These last three genus @-@ types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform . 
 = = Formation = = 
 Cumulus clouds form via atmospheric convection as air warmed by the surface begins to rise . As the air rises , the temperature drops ( following the lapse rate ) , causing the relative humidity ( RH ) to rise . If convection reaches a certain level the RH reaches one hundred percent , and the " wet @-@ adiabatic " phase begins . At this point a positive feedback ensues : since the RH is above 100 % , water vapor condenses , releasing latent heat , warming the air and spurring further convection . 
 In this phase , water vapor condenses on various nuclei present in the air , forming the cumulus cloud . This creates the characteristic flat @-@ bottomed puffy shape associated with cumulus clouds . The size of the cloud depends on the temperature profile of the atmosphere and the presence of any inversions . During the convection , surrounding air is entrained ( mixed ) with the thermal and the total mass of the ascending air increases . Rain forms in a cumulus cloud via a process involving two non @-@ discrete stages . The first stage occurs after the droplets coalesce onto the various nuclei . Langmuir writes that surface tension in the water droplets provides a slightly higher pressure on the droplet , raising the vapor pressure by a small amount . The increased pressure results in those droplets evaporating and the resulting water vapor condensing on the larger droplets . Due to the extremely small size of the evaporating water droplets , this process becomes largely meaningless after the larger droplets have grown to around 20 to 30 micrometres , and the second stage takes over . In the accretion phase , the raindrop begins to fall , and other droplets collide and combine with it to increase the size of the raindrop . Langmuir was able to develop a formula which predicted that the droplet radius would grow <unk> within a discrete time period . 
 = = Description = = 
 The liquid water density within a cumulus cloud has been found to change with height above the cloud base rather than being approximately constant throughout the cloud . At the cloud base , the concentration was 0 grams of liquid water per kilogram of air . As altitude increased , the concentration rapidly increased to the maximum concentration near the middle of the cloud . The maximum concentration was found to be anything up to 1 @.@ 25 grams of water per kilogram of air . The concentration slowly dropped off as altitude increased to the height of the top of the cloud , where it immediately dropped to zero again . 
 Cumulus clouds can form in lines stretching over 480 kilometres ( 300 mi ) long called cloud streets . These cloud streets cover vast areas and may be broken or continuous . They form when wind shear causes horizontal circulation in the atmosphere , producing the long , tubular cloud streets . They generally form during high @-@ pressure systems , such as after a cold front . 
 The height at which the cloud forms depends on the amount of moisture in the thermal that forms the cloud . Humid air will generally result in a lower cloud base . In temperate areas , the base of the cumulus clouds is usually below 550 metres ( 1 @,@ 800 ft ) above ground level , but it can range up to 2 @,@ 400 metres ( 7 @,@ 900 ft ) in altitude . In arid and mountainous areas , the cloud base can be in excess of 6 @,@ 100 metres ( 20 @,@ 000 ft ) . 
 Cumulus clouds can be composed of ice crystals , water droplets , supercooled water droplets , or a mixture of them . The water droplets form when water vapor condenses on the nuclei , and they may then coalesce into larger and larger droplets . In temperate regions , the cloud bases studied ranged from 500 to 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 to 4 @,@ 900 ft ) above ground level . These clouds were normally above 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) , and the concentration of droplets ranged from 23 to 1300 droplets per cubic centimeter ( 380 to 21 @,@ 300 droplets per cubic inch ) . This data was taken from growing isolated cumulus clouds that were not precipitating . The droplets were very small , ranging down to around 5 micrometers in diameter . Although smaller droplets may have been present , the measurements were not sensitive enough to detect them . The smallest droplets were found in the lower portions of the clouds , with the percentage of large droplets ( around 20 to 30 micrometers ) rising dramatically in the upper regions of the cloud . The droplet size distribution was slightly bimodal in nature , with peaks at the small and large droplet sizes and a slight trough in the intermediate size range . The skew was roughly neutral . Furthermore , large droplet size is roughly inversely proportional to the droplet concentration per unit volume of air . In places , cumulus clouds can have " holes " where there are no water droplets . These can occur when winds tear the cloud and incorporate the environmental air or when strong downdrafts evaporate the water . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Cumulus clouds come in four distinct species , <unk> humilis , mediocris , congestus , and fractus . These species may be arranged into the variety , cumulus radiatus ; and may be accompanied by up to seven supplementary features , cumulus pileus , velum , virga , <unk> , arcus , pannus , and tuba . 
 The species Cumulus fractus is ragged in appearance and can form in clear air as a precursor to cumulus humilis and larger cumulus species @-@ types ; or it can form in precipitation as the supplementary feature pannus ( also called <unk> ) which can also include stratus fractus of bad weather . Cumulus humilis clouds look like puffy , flattened shapes . Cumulus mediocris clouds look similar , except that they have some vertical development . Cumulus congestus clouds have a cauliflower @-@ like structure and tower high into the atmosphere , hence their alternate name " towering cumulus " . The variety Cumulus radiatus forms in radial bands called cloud streets and can comprise any of the four species of cumulus . 
 Cumulus supplementary features are most commonly seen with the species congestus . Cumulus virga clouds are cumulus clouds producing virga ( precipitation that evaporates while aloft ) , and cumulus <unk> produce precipitation that reaches the Earth 's surface . Cumulus pannus comprise shredded clouds that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation . Cumulus arcus clouds have a gust front , and cumulus tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes . Cumulus pileus clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus over the top of the cloud . Cumulus velum clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud . 
 = = Forecast = = 
 Cumulus humilis clouds usually indicate fair weather . Cumulus mediocris clouds are similar , except that they have some vertical development , which implies that they can grow into cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds , which can produce heavy rain , lightning , severe winds , hail , and even tornadoes . Cumulus congestus clouds , which appear as towers , will often grow into cumulonimbus storm clouds . They can produce precipitation . Glider pilots often pay close attention to cumulus clouds , as they can be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the sky — a phenomenon known as cloud suck . 
 Cumulus clouds can also produce acid rain or possibly a tornado . The acidity is largely formed by the oxidation of sulfur dioxide , the most plentiful acidifying gas , into sulfate ions . The main oxidizing compounds are hydrogen peroxide and ozone . Various nitrogen oxides can also react with hydroxide ions to form acids . 
 = = Effects on climate = = 
 Due to reflectivity , clouds cool the earth by around 12 ° C ( 22 ° F ) , an effect largely caused by stratocumulus clouds . However , at the same time , they heat the earth by around 7 ° C ( 13 ° F ) by reflecting emitted radiation , an effect largely caused by cirrus clouds . This averages out to a net loss of 5 ° C ( 9 @.@ 0 ° F ) . Cumulus clouds , on the other hand , have a variable effect on heating the earth 's surface . The more vertical cumulus congestus species and cumulonimbus genus of clouds grow high into the atmosphere , carrying moisture with them , which can lead to the formation of cirrus clouds . The researchers speculated that this might even produce a positive feedback , where the increasing upper atmospheric moisture further warms the earth , resulting in an increasing number of cumulus congestus clouds carrying more moisture into the upper atmosphere . 
 = = Relation to other clouds = = 
 Cumulus clouds are a genus of free @-@ convective low @-@ étage cloud along with the related limited @-@ convective cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud stratocumulus . These clouds form from ground level to 2 @,@ 000 metres ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) at all latitudes . Stratus clouds are also low @-@ étage . In the middle étage are the alto clouds , which consist of the <unk> @-@ convective cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud altocumulus and the stratiform cloud altostratus . Middle @-@ étage clouds form from 2 @,@ 000 metres ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) to 7 @,@ 000 metres ( 23 @,@ 000 ft ) in polar areas , 7 @,@ 000 metres ( 23 @,@ 000 ft ) in temperate areas , and 7 @,@ 600 metres ( 24 @,@ 900 ft ) in tropical areas . The high @-@ étage clouds are all cirriform , one of which , cirrocumulus , is also cumuliform of limited convection or stratocumuliform . The other clouds in this étage are cirrus and cirrostratus . High @-@ étage clouds form 3 @,@ 000 to 7 @,@ 600 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 to 24 @,@ 900 ft ) in high latitudes , 5 @,@ 000 to 12 @,@ 000 metres ( 16 @,@ 000 to 39 @,@ 000 ft ) in temperate latitudes , and 6 @,@ 100 to 18 @,@ 000 metres ( 20 @,@ 000 to 59 @,@ 100 ft ) in low , tropical latitudes . Cumulonimbus clouds , like cumulus congestus , extend vertically rather than remaining confined to one étage . 
 = = = Cirrocumulus clouds = = = 
 Cirrocumulus clouds form in patches and cannot cast shadows . They commonly appear in regular , rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between . Cirrocumulus are , like other members of the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories , formed via convective processes . Significant growth of these patches indicates high @-@ altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather . The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders . They are not solid , but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends . Towards the top of the cloud , these crystals have a tendency to clump together . These clouds do not last long , and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals , they eventually begin to fall , destroying the upward convection . The cloud then dissipates into cirrus . Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus @-@ types that have limited @-@ convective or stratocumuliform characteristics : stratiformis , lenticularis , castellanus , and floccus . They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size . 
 = = = Altocumulus clouds = = = 
 Altocumulus clouds are a middle @-@ étage cloud that forms from 2 @,@ 000 metres ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) high to 4 @,@ 000 metres ( 13 @,@ 000 ft ) in polar areas , 7 @,@ 000 metres ( 23 @,@ 000 ft ) in temperate areas , and 7 @,@ 600 metres ( 24 @,@ 900 ft ) in tropical areas . They can have precipitation and are commonly composed of a mixture of ice crystals , supercooled water droplets , and water droplets in temperate latitudes . However , the liquid water concentration was almost always significantly greater than the concentration of ice crystals , and the maximum concentration of liquid water tended to be at the top of the cloud while the ice concentrated itself at the bottom . The ice crystals in the base of the altocumulus clouds and in the virga were found to be dendrites or conglomerations of dendrites while needles and plates resided more towards the top . Altocumulus clouds can form via convection or via the forced uplift caused by a warm front . Because Altocumulus is a genus @-@ type of limited convection , it is divided into the same four species as cirrocumulus . 
 = = = Stratocumulus clouds = = = 
 A stratocumulus cloud is another type of a cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud . Like cumulus clouds , they form at low levels and via convection . However , unlike cumulus clouds , their growth is almost completely retarded by a strong inversion . As a result , they flatten out like stratus clouds , giving them a layered appearance . These clouds are extremely common , covering on average around twenty @-@ three percent of the earth 's oceans and twelve percent of the earth 's continents . They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after cold fronts . Additionally , stratocumulus clouds reflect a large amount of the incoming sunlight , producing a net cooling effect . Stratocumulus clouds can produce drizzle , which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing turbulent mixing . Being a cloud of limited convection , stratocumulus is divided into three species ; stratiformis , lenticularis , and castellanus , that are common to the higher stratocumuliform genus @-@ types . 
 = = = Cumulonimbus clouds = = = 
 Cumulonimbus clouds are the final form of growing cumulus clouds . They form when cumulus congestus clouds develop a strong updraft that propels their tops higher and higher into the atmosphere until they reach the tropopause at 18 @,@ 000 metres ( 59 @,@ 000 ft ) in altitude . Cumulonimbus clouds , commonly called <unk> , can produce high winds , torrential rain , lightning , gust fronts , waterspouts , funnel clouds , and tornadoes . They commonly have anvil clouds .

 Some cumuliform clouds have been discovered on most other planets in the solar system . On Mars , the Viking Orbiter detected cirrocumulus and stratocumulus clouds forming via convection primarily near the polar icecaps . The Galileo space probe detected massive cumulonimbus clouds near the Great Red Spot on Jupiter . <unk> clouds have also been detected on Saturn . In 2008 , the Cassini spacecraft determined that cumulus clouds near Saturn 's south pole were part of a cyclone over 4 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 2 @,@ 500 mi ) in diameter . The Keck Observatory detected whitish cumulus clouds on Uranus . Like Uranus , Neptune has methane cumulus clouds . Venus , however , does not appear to have cumulus clouds . 
 = Night of January 16th = 
 Night of January 16th is a theatrical play , inspired by the death of the " Match King " , Ivar Kreuger , written by Ayn Rand . It takes place entirely in a courtroom during a murder trial . An unusual feature of the play is that members of the audience are chosen to play the roles of jury members . The court is hearing the case of Karen Andre , a former secretary and lover of businessman Bjorn Faulkner , of whose murder Andre is accused . The play does not directly portray the events leading to Faulkner 's death ; instead the jury must rely on character testimony and decide whether Andre is guilty . The play 's ending depends on the verdict . Rand 's intention was to dramatize a conflict between individualism and conformity , with the jury 's verdict revealing which viewpoint they preferred . 
 The play was first produced in 1934 in Los Angeles under the title Woman on Trial ; it received positive reviews and enjoyed moderate commercial success . Producer Al Woods took it to Broadway during the 1935 – 36 season and re @-@ titled it Night of January 16th . It drew attention for use of a jury and became a hit , running for seven months . Doris Nolan , in her Broadway debut , received positive criticism for her portrayal of the lead role . Several regional productions followed . An off @-@ Broadway revival in 1973 , under the title Penthouse Legend , was a commercial and critical failure . 
 Rand had many heated disputes with Woods over script changes he wanted for the Broadway production . Their disputes climaxed in an arbitration hearing when Rand discovered he had diverted a portion of her royalties to pay for a script doctor . Because of the changes , Rand disliked the Broadway production and the version published for amateur productions , so in 1968 she re @-@ edited the script for publication as the " definitive " version . A movie loosely based on the play was released in 1941 ; the story has also been adapted for television and radio . 
 = = History = = 
 Rand drew inspiration for the play from two sources . After seeing The Trial of Mary Dugan , a 1927 melodrama about a showgirl prosecuted for killing her wealthy lover , Rand decided to write her own play featuring a trial . Rand 's play would have no fixed ending ; the ending could vary depending on the result of the trial . She based her victim on Ivar Kreuger , a Swedish businessman known as the " Match King " who held monopolies on the manufacture of matches . When Kreuger 's business empire became financially unstable , he shot himself after being accused of undertaking underhanded and possibly illegal financial deals . From this incident , Rand was inspired to make the victim a businessman of great ambition and dubious character , who had given multiple people motives for his murder . 
 Rand wrote Night of January 16th in 1933 . She was 28 years old and had been in the United States for seven years after emigrating from the Soviet Union , where her strong anti @-@ Communist opinions had put her at risk . Rand had never written a stage play , but had worked in Hollywood as a junior screenwriter for Cecil B. DeMille , and later in RKO Studios ' wardrobe department . In September 1932 , Rand sold an original screenplay , Red Pawn , to Universal Studios and quit RKO to finish her first novel , We the Living . She wrote the stage play with the hope of making money from it while she was finishing her novel . By 1934 , her agent was trying to sell the play and the novel , but both were repeatedly rejected . Red Pawn was shelved and Rand 's contract for rewrites on it expired . Rand 's husband , an actor , was getting only minor roles with little pay , putting the couple in financial difficulties . With the last of her money from Red Pawn exhausted , Rand got an offer for her new play from Al Woods , who had produced The Trial of Mary Dugan for Broadway . The contract included a condition that Woods could make changes to the script . Wary that he would destroy her vision of the play to create a more conventional drama , Rand turned Woods down . Soon after , she accepted an offer from Welsh actor E. E. Clive to produce the play in Los Angeles . It opened in October 1934 under the title Woman on Trial . 
 At the end of the play 's run in Los Angeles , Woods renewed his offer to produce the play on Broadway . Although he was a renowned producer of many famous plays in a career of more than three decades , Woods had lost much of his fortune after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and had not produced a hit in several years . Being refused by a neophyte author shocked him and increased his interest . Woods still wanted the right to make script changes , but he made adjustments to the contract to give Rand more influence . She reluctantly agreed to his terms . 
 Rand arrived in New York at the beginning of December 1934 in anticipation of the opening in January . The play 's financing failed , delaying the production for several months until Woods arranged new financing from theater owner Lee Shubert . When work resumed , Rand 's relationship with Woods quickly soured as he demanded changes she later derided as " a junk heap of worn , irrelevant melodramatic devices " . Woods had made his success on Broadway with low @-@ brow melodramas such as Nellie , the Beautiful Cloak Model and risqué comedies such as The Demi @-@ Virgin . Woods was not interested in what he called Rand 's " <unk> speeches " , preferring the dramatic conflict to focus on concrete elements , such as whether the defendant had a gun . The changes to Rand 's play included the creation of a new character , a gun moll played by Shubert 's mistress . 
 The contract between Woods and Rand allowed him to hire collaborators if he thought it necessary , and pay them a limited portion of the author 's royalties . He first hired John Hayden to direct , paying him one percent from Rand 's 10 @-@ percent royalty . Although Hayden was a successful Broadway director , Rand disliked him and later called him " a very <unk> Broadway hanger @-@ on " . As auditions for the play began in Philadelphia , Woods demanded further script changes and was frustrated by Rand 's refusal to make some of them . He engaged Louis Weitzenkorn , the author of a previous hit , Five Star Final , to act as a script doctor . Rand 's relationship with Weitzenkorn was worse than those with Woods or Hayden ; she and Weitzenkorn argued over political differences as well as his ideas for the play . Woods gave Weitzenkorn another one percent from Rand 's royalties without informing her . Rand filed a claim against Woods with the American Arbitration Association . She objected to Weitzenkorn receiving any portion of her royalties , telling the arbitration panel Weitzenkorn had added only a single line to the play , which was cut after the auditions . Upon hearing this testimony , one of the arbitrators responded incredulously , " That was all he did ? " In two hearings , the panel ruled that Weitzenkorn should receive his agreed @-@ upon one percent , but that Woods could not deduct the payment from Rand 's royalties because she had not been notified in advance . 
 Despite the disputes between Rand and Woods , the play opened at Shubert 's Ambassador Theatre in September 1935 and ran for seven months . Night of January 16th was the last theatrical success for either Rand or Woods . Rand 's next play , Ideal , went unsold , and a 1940 stage adaptation of We the Living flopped . She achieved lasting success and financial stability with her 1943 novel , The Fountainhead . Woods produced six more plays ; none were hits and when he died in 1951 , he was bankrupt and living in a hotel . 
 = = = Published versions = = = 
 Night of January 16th was first published in an edition for amateur theater organizations in 1936 , using a version edited by drama professor Nathaniel Edward Reeid , which included further changes to eliminate elements such as swearing and smoking . Rand disowned this version because of the changes . In 1960 , Rand 's protégé Nathaniel Branden asked about doing a public reading of the play for students at the Nathaniel Branden Institute . Rand did not want him to use the amateur version ; she created a revised text that eliminated most of Woods ' and Reeid 's changes . She had her " final , definitive version " published in 1968 with an introduction about the play 's history . Rand made several dozen further small changes in language for an off @-@ Broadway revival in 1973 . 
 = = = Title changes = = = 
 Although best known as Night of January 16th , the play 's title changed multiple times and several alternative titles were considered . Rand 's working title was Penthouse Legend . When Clive picked up the play , he thought Rand 's title suggested a fantasy story that would discourage potential patrons . The play was called The Verdict during the Hollywood Playhouse rehearsals , but opened with the title Woman on Trial . When Woods took the play to Broadway , he insisted on a new title . He offered Rand a choice between The Black Sedan and Night of January 16th . Rand liked neither , but picked the latter . Woods later suggested two more name changes , but did not implement them . Prior to the opening , he considered renaming the play The Night is Young . After the play opened , he considered changing its name each day to match the current date . 
 When Rand published her version of the play in 1968 , she wrote that although she disliked the Broadway title , it was too well known to change it again . She agreed to using Penthouse Legend as the title for the 1973 revival production .

In the wake of a financial crash , he was facing bankruptcy . The play 's events occur entirely in a courtroom ; Faulkner himself is never seen . On the night of January 16 , Faulkner and Andre were in the penthouse of the Faulkner Building in New York City , when Faulkner apparently fell to his death . Within the three acts , the prosecutor Mr. Flint and Andre 's defense attorney Mr. Stevens call witnesses whose testimonies build conflicting stories . 
 At the beginning of the first act , the judge asks the court clerk to call jurors from the audience . Once the jurors are seated , the prosecution argument begins . Flint explains that Andre was not just Faulkner 's secretary , but also his lover . He says Faulkner jilted her to marry Nancy Lee Whitfield and fired Andre , motivating Andre to murder him . Flint then calls a series of witnesses , starting with the medical examiner , who testifies that Faulkner 's body was so damaged by the fall that it was impossible to determine whether he was killed by the impact or was already dead . An elderly night watchman and a private investigator both describe the events they saw that evening . A police inspector testifies to finding a suicide note . Faulkner 's very religious housekeeper disapprovingly describes the sexual relationship between Andre and Faulkner , and says she saw Andre with another man after Faulkner 's marriage . Nancy Lee testifies about her and Faulkner 's courtship and marriage , portraying both as idyllic . The act ends with Andre speaking out @-@ of @-@ turn to accuse Nancy Lee of lying . 
 The second act continues the prosecution 's case , with Flint calling John Graham Whitfield — Faulkner 's father @-@ in @-@ law and president of Whitfield National Bank . He testifies about a large loan he made to Faulkner . In his cross @-@ examination , defense attorney Stevens suggests the loan was used to buy Faulkner 's marriage to Whitfield 's daughter . After this testimony , the prosecution rests and the defense argument begins . A handwriting expert testifies about the signature on the suicide note . Faulkner 's bookkeeper describes events between Andre 's dismissal and the night of Faulkner 's death , and related financial matters . Andre takes the stand and describes her relationship with Faulkner as both his lover and his partner in financial fraud . She says she did not resent his marriage because it was a business deal to secure credit from the Whitfield Bank . As she starts to explain the reasons for Faulkner 's alleged suicide , she is interrupted by the arrival of " Guts " Regan , an infamous gangster , who tells Andre that Faulkner is dead . Despite being on trial for Faulkner 's murder , Andre is shocked by this news and faints . 
 The final act continues Andre 's testimony ; she is now somber rather than defiant . She says she , Faulkner , and Regan had conspired to fake Faulkner 's suicide so they could escape with money stolen from Whitfield . Regan , who was also in love with Andre , provided the stolen body of one of his already @-@ dead gang associates , " Lefty " O 'Toole , to throw from the building . In cross @-@ examination , Flint suggests she and Regan were using knowledge of past criminal activities to blackmail Faulkner . Stevens then calls Regan , who testifies that he was due to meet Faulkner at a getaway plane after leaving the stolen body with Andre ; however , Faulkner did not arrive and the plane was missing . Instead of Faulkner , Regan encountered Whitfield , who gave him a check that was , according to Regan , to buy his silence . Regan later found the missing plane , which had been burned with what he presumes is Faulkner 's body inside . Flint 's cross @-@ examination offers an alternative theory : Regan put the stolen body into the plane to create doubt about Andre 's guilt , and the check from Whitfield was protection money to Regan 's gang . In the play 's Broadway and amateur versions , the next witness is Roberta Van <unk> , an exotic dancer and wife of O 'Toole , who believes Regan killed her husband . This character does not appear in Rand 's preferred version of the play . Stevens then recalls two witnesses to follow @-@ up on issues from Regan 's testimony . The defense and prosecution then give their closing arguments . 
 The jury retires to vote while the characters repeat highlights from their testimony under a spotlight . The jury then returns to announce its verdict . One of two short endings follows . If found not guilty , Andre thanks the jury . If found guilty , she says the jury have spared her from committing suicide . In Reeid 's amateur version , after either verdict the judge berates the jurors for their bad judgment and declares that they cannot serve on a jury again . 
 = = Productions = = 
 Night of January 16th has had several professional productions under three titles . It first opened at the Hollywood Playhouse in Los Angeles as Woman on Trial . E. E. Clive produced the play and Barbara Bedford played Andre . The production opened on October 22 , 1934 , and closed in late November 1934 . 
 The most successful production was at the Ambassador Theatre on Broadway , where it was titled Night of January 16th ; this version was produced by Woods and directed by John Hayden . Doris Nolan played the defendant . The play opened on September 16 , 1935 , and closed on April 4 , 1936 , with 283 performances . 
 When the play 's success on Broadway was clear , Woods launched productions of the play in other cities , starting with San Francisco . It opened there at the Geary Theater on December 30 , 1935 , and ran for five weeks with <unk> Harrigan in the lead role . Harrigan stayed with the show when it moved to the El Capitan theater in Los Angeles , where it opened on March 1 , 1936 . After the Broadway production closed , Woods started a road tour that included productions in Boston and Chicago . 
 International productions of the play included shows in London , Montreal , and Sydney . The production in London opened on September 29 , 1936 , where Phoebe Foster took the lead role for her first appearance on the London stage . It closed after 22 performances . A production in Montreal opened on June 16 , 1941 , starring Fay Wray as Andre and Robert Wilcox as Regan . In Sydney , the play opened at the Minerva Theatre on June 19 , 1944 , with Thelma Grigg as Andre . 
 In 1972 , Rand approved an off @-@ Broadway revival of the play , which used her preferred version of the script and her original title , Penthouse Legend . It was produced by Phillip and Kay Nolte Smith , a married couple who were friends with Rand . Kay Smith also starred in the production under the stage name Kay Gillian . It opened at the McAlpin Rooftop Theater on February 22 , 1973 , and closed on March 18 , 1973 , after 30 performances . 
 = = Broadway cast and characters = = 
 The play 's protagonist and lead female role is the defendant , Karen Andre . Woods considered several actresses for the role , but with Rand 's support he cast an unusual choice , an actress named Doris Nolan . It was Nolan 's Broadway debut ; her previous professional acting experience was a failed attempt at completing a movie scene . At 17 years old , she was cast as a presumably @-@ older femme fatale . Woods was Nolan 's manager and got a commission from her contract . Nolan was inexperienced and was nervous throughout rehearsals . When other actresses visited , she feared they were there to replace her . Although Rand later said she was " not a sensational actress " , reviewers praised her performance . Nolan left the cast in March to take a movie contract from Universal Studios . 
 Rand actively pushed for Walter Pidgeon to be cast in the role of " Guts " Regan . Woods objected at first , but eventually gave Pidgeon the part . As with Nolan , reviewers approved the choice . Pidgeon left the production after about a month to take a role in another play , There 's Wisdom in Women . Despite Rand 's objections , he was replaced with William Bakewell ; Rand recommended Morgan Conway , who played the same role in Woman on Trial .

 = = = Jury element = = = 
 The selection of a jury from the play 's audience was the primary dramatic innovation of Night of January 16th . It created concerns among many of the producers who considered and rejected the play . Although Woods liked the idea , Hayden worried it would destroy the theatrical illusion ; he feared audience members might refuse to participate . Successful jury selections during previews indicated this would not be a problem . This criticism dissipated following the play 's success ; it became famous for its " jury gimmick " . 
 The play 's jury has sometimes enlisted famous participants ; the Broadway selections were rigged to call on celebrities known to be in the audience . The jury for the Broadway opening included attorney Edward J. Reilly — who was known from the Lindbergh kidnapping trial earlier that year — and boxing champion Jack Dempsey . Jurors for subsequent Broadway performances included actors Ricardo Cortez , Fania <unk> , Chester Morris , Margaret Wycherly , and Roland Young ; attorneys Dudley Field Malone and Samuel Leibowitz ; baseball player Babe Ruth ; bridge player Ely Culbertson ; director Eddie Buzzell ; and James Roosevelt — son of President Franklin Roosevelt . At a special performance for the blind , Helen Keller sat on the jury . The jurors for the London opening included musician Jack Hylton and actors Adrianne Allen , Raymond Massey , and Vera Pearce . Opening night jurors in Sydney included cartoonist Jimmy <unk> , tennis champion Jack Crawford , writer Ethel Knight Kelly , and attorneys Bill Dovey , Vernon Treatt , and Richard Windeyer . 
 Woods decided the jury for the Broadway run would employ some jury service rules of the New York courts . One such rule was the payment of jurors three dollars per day for their participation , which meant the selected audience members profited by at least 25 cents after subtracting the ticket price . Another was that only men could serve on a jury , although Woods made exceptions , for example at the performance Keller attended . He later loosened the rule to allow women jurors at matinee performances twice a week . Unlike a normal criminal trial , verdicts required only a majority vote rather than unanimity . 
 = = = Themes = = = 
 Rand described Night of January 16th as " a sense @-@ of @-@ life play " . She did not want its events to be taken literally , but to be understood as a representation of different ways of approaching life . Andre represents an ambitious , confident , non @-@ conformist approach to life , while the prosecution witnesses represent conformity , envy of success , and the desire for power over others . Rand believed the jury 's decision at each performance revealed the attitude of the jurors towards these two conflicting senses of life . Rand supported individualism and considered Andre " not guilty " . She said she wanted the play to convey the viewpoint : " Your life , your achievement , your happiness , your person are of paramount importance . Live up to your highest vision of yourself no matter what the circumstances you might encounter . An exalted view of self @-@ esteem is man 's most admirable quality . " She said the play " is not a philosophical treatise on morality " and represents this view only in a basic way . 
 Several later commentators have interpreted the play as a reflection of Rand 's early interest in the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche . Shoshana Milgram saw elements of Nietzsche 's morality in the descriptions of Bjorn Faulkner , who " never thought of things as right or wrong " . Ronald Merrill went further , calling the play " a powerful and eloquent plea for the Nietzschean worldview " of the superiority of the " superman " ; this is represented by Faulkner , who Merrill interprets as rejecting external moral authority and the " slave morality " of ordinary people . Others found significance in Rand 's admiration of the play 's criminal characters . Historian Jennifer Burns said Rand " found criminality an irresistible metaphor for individualism " because of the influence on her of " Nietzsche 's <unk> of values [ that ] changed criminals into heroes " . Rand said criminality was not the important attribute of the characters ; she said a criminal could serve as " an eloquent symbol " of independence and rebellion against conformity , but stated , " I do not think , nor did I think when I wrote this play , that a swindler is a heroic character or that a respectable banker is a villain " . Merrill dismissed this explanation as a cover @-@ up for the play 's promotion of Nietzschean ideas that Rand later rejected . Similarly , biographer Anne Heller said Rand " later renounced her romantic fascination with criminals " , making the characters ' criminality an embarrassment for her . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Since its premiere , Night of January 16th has had a mixed reception . The initial Los Angeles run as Woman on Trial received complimentary reviews ; Rand was disappointed reviews focused on the play 's melodrama and its similarity to The Trial of Mary Dugan , while paying little attention to aspects she considered more important , such as the contrasting ideas of individualism and conformity . Rand later described the production as " badly handicapped by lack of funds " and " competent , but somewhat unexciting " , but it performed reasonably well at the box office during its short run . 
 The Broadway production received largely positive reviews that praised its melodrama and the acting of Nolan and Pidgeon . Commonweal described it as " well constructed , well enough written , admirably directed ... and excellently acted " . The Brooklyn Daily Eagle said the action came in " fits and starts " , but praised the acting and the novelty of the use of a jury . New York Post critic John Mason Brown said the play had some flaws , but was an exciting , above @-@ average melodrama . Brooks Atkinson gave it a negative review in The New York Times , calling it " the usual brew of hokum " . A review from Theatre Arts Monthly was also dismissive , calling the play a " fashionable game " that would be " fun in a parlor " but seemed " pretty foolish " on stage . Some reviews focused on Woods as the source of the play 's positive attributes because he had had many previous theatrical successes . Time said Woods was repeating a successful formula from The Trial of Mary Dugan . Reviews that praised these elements were an embarrassment to Rand , who considered Woods ' changes to be negative . Again , reviewers ignored the broader themes that Rand considered important . 
 Professional productions in other North American cities typically received positive reviews . Austin B. <unk> described the production at San Francisco 's Geary Theater as " darned good theater " that was " well acted " and " crisply written " . Charles Collins said the Chicago production was " a first class story " that was " well acted by an admirably selected cast " . Thomas Archer 's review of the Montreal production described it as " realistic " and " absorbing " . 
 The London production in 1936 received mostly positive reviews but was not a commercial success . A reviewer for The Times praised Foster 's performance as " tense and beautiful " . In The Daily Telegraph , reviewer W. A. Darlington said the show would be popular with audiences , but the production ended its run in less than a month . The review in The Glasgow Herald described it as a " strong , quick thriller " , but with inferior dialog to The Trial of Mary Dugan . The reviewer for The Spectator was more critical , saying the play itself was " strong " , but was undermined by " mediocre playing " from " bad actors " . 
 The 1973 revival as Penthouse Legend was a failure and received strongly negative reviews . A reviewer for The Village Voice complimented the story 's melodramatic plot twists but said it was " preposterously badly written " and described the production as " conventional and obvious " . In The New York Times , Clive Barnes called the play tedious and said the acting was " not particularly good " . It closed within a few weeks . 
 Academics and biographers reviewing the play have also expressed mixed opinions . Theater scholar Gerald Bordman declared it " an unexceptional courtroom drama " made popular by the jury element , although he noted praise for the acting of Breese and Pidgeon . Historian James Baker described Rand 's presentation of courtroom behavior as unrealistic , but said audiences forgive this because the play 's dramatic moments are " so much fun " . He said the play was " great entertainment " that is " held together by an enormously attractive woman and a gimmick " , but " it is not philosophy " and fails to convey the themes Rand had in mind . Jennifer Burns expressed a similar view , stating that the play 's attempts to portray individualism had " dubious results ... Rand intended Bjorn Faulkner to embody heroic individualism , but in the play he comes off as little more than an unscrupulous businessman with a taste for rough sex " . Literature scholar Mimi <unk> Gladstein described the play as " significant for dramatic ingenuity and thematic content " . Rand biographer Anne Heller considered it " engaging , if stilted " , while Ronald Merrill described it as " a skillfully constructed drama " undercut by " Rand 's peculiar inability to write an effective mystery plot without leaving holes " . Mystery critic Marvin Lachman noted the novelty of the use of a jury but called the play unrealistic with " stilted dialogue " and " stereotypical characters " .

 The movie rights to Night of January 16th were initially purchased by Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer ( MGM ) in October 1934 as a possible vehicle for Loretta Young . They hired Rand to write a screenplay , but the project was scrapped . After MGM 's option expired , Woods considered making a movie version through a production company of his own , but in 1938 RKO Pictures bought the rights for $ 10 @,@ 000 , a fee split between Woods and Rand . RKO considered Claudette Colbert and Lucille Ball as possible stars , but they also gave up on the adaptation . The rights were resold to Paramount Pictures in July 1939 for $ 35 @,@ 000 . Paramount released a movie in 1941 ; Rand did not participate in the production . The film was directed by William Clemens , and Delmer Daves , Robert <unk> , and Eve Greene were engaged to prepare a new screenplay . 
 The new screenplay altered the plot significantly , focusing on Steve Van <unk> ( Robert Preston ) , a sailor who inherits a position on the board of a company headed by Bjorn Faulkner ( Nils <unk> ) . Unlike the play , in which Faulkner is already dead , he <unk> in the film as a living character who is apparently murdered . Suspicion falls on Faulkner 's secretary Kit Lane ( Ellen Drew ) ; Van <unk> decides to investigate the alleged crime . Faulkner is discovered hiding in Cuba after faking his own death . Rand said only a single line from her original dialog appeared in the movie , which she dismissed as a " cheap , trashy vulgarity " . The film received little attention when it was released , and most reviews of it were negative .

While walking around the property , Tim finds a gun and a bone in the backyard . At first he wants to dig up the surrounding ground to see if a body is buried there , but Lee convinces him it is a bad idea . 
 When Lee and Jude leave for the weekend to stay with her parents so that Tim can work without distraction on the family 's taxes , he invites a group of friends — including Ray ( Sam Rockwell ) , Phil ( Mike Birbiglia ) , Adam ( Kent Osborne ) , and Paul ( Steve Berg ) — to the house for the night . After a few drinks , they decide to dig up the backyard together , quickly finding another bone and a license plate . Phil , who is skeptical about the digging , leaves with Adam and Paul as Alicia ( Anna Kendrick ) , Max ( Brie Larson ) and Billy ( Chris Messina ) arrive at the house . Billy pairs off with Alicia and Ray with Max while Tim continues to dig . He finds a shoe before deciding to go to sleep . 
 The next morning , Tim is visited by a neighbor who warns him that digging for buried items in the backyard is a bad idea and says that the site was once the " Chicano Hall of Fame " . Soon afterwards , Max returns to pick up her purse and finds Tim digging again . She joins him and discovers a plastic bag filled with bones . Meanwhile , Lee goes to visit her sister <unk> ( Melanie Lynskey ) and brother @-@ in @-@ law Bob ( Ron Livingston ) for an afternoon after complaining to her mother that she no longer feels she has an identity outside of being a mother and wife .

 Digging for Fire was based on a real incident in which Jake Johnson and his wife dug up a bone and a gun in the garden of a house they had rented . Over a couple of weeks , he and a group of his friends dug up various objects before deciding to bury them again . Johnson described the experience to Joe Swanberg about three years later and they decided to make a film about it . They wrote a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half – page outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue or detailed character descriptions . Swanberg wanted the actors to improvise the details of each scene and allowed them to make choices about their characters : for instance , Orlando Bloom decided that his character would ride a motorcycle , Chris Messina suggested that his character go swimming naked , and Brie Larson persuaded Johnson and Swanberg that her character would not be sexually attracted to Tim . 
 Digging for Fire features an ensemble cast , the largest Swanberg had worked with at the time . He and Johnson cast the film by contacting friends and other actors who they knew had enjoyed their previous film together , Drinking Buddies . Rosemarie DeWitt and Swanberg decided to work together after her husband , Ron Livingston , starred in Drinking Buddies . Unlike the other actors , Orlando Bloom was cast through an agent . Swanberg cast his own son , Jude , as the three @-@ year @-@ old son of the lead characters . 
 The film was shot over 15 days in Los Angeles and Malibu , California . Swanberg and cinematographer Ben Richardson decided to shoot on 35 mm film rather than digitally , as most of Swanberg 's previous films had been made . They decided to shoot on film , Richardson said , because " there is a certain visual integrity to a film @-@ derived image that is still lacking for me in most of the digitally @-@ derived imagery that we see " . Although the film 's dialogue was improvised , the actors rehearsed each scene before filming so that the scene could be blocked out due to the constraints of working with film rather than digital . 
 Swanberg found the process of editing Digging for Fire more difficult than for his previous films , since there were many different possibilities of how to integrate the separate storylines involving Tim and Lee . He dedicated the film to Paul Mazursky , who died in 2014 , because of the thematic similarities between Mazursky 's work , especially the 1969 film Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice , and Digging for Fire and the influence Mazursky had on Swanberg 's work .

 Jean @-@ Yves Duperron of the Classical Music Sentinel appreciated the continuity of the subject matter and compared the album to a three @-@ movement symphony . Referring to the opener as the first movement of this hypothetical symphony , Duperron wrote that Wagner 's composition " works perfectly " by setting the tone for the album . He appreciated the Berlioz composition as a " central movement " for its more " pleasant " mood and lighter musical textures , and Tchaikovsky 's work as the finale for its dramatic and " tumultuous " qualities . Duperron complimented DePreist and the orchestra for conveying the emotions depicted in each of the compositions " loud and clear " , and specifically highlighted the " massive walls of sound " produced by the strings . He also commended Delos for effectively capturing the performances " with clean and powerful dynamics throughout " and concluded the review by quipping : " This perfectly coordinated collection should be part of every collection !

 As a preteen , Anggun was influenced by Western rock music artists . At the age of twelve , she released her first official studio album , Dunia Aku Punya ( 1986 ) . The album was produced by Ian Antono , an Indonesian rock musician . However , the album failed to establish her popularity . Three years later , Anggun achieved some fame after the release of the single " Mimpi " ; the song was later ranked by the Rolling Stone Indonesia magazine as one of the 150 Greatest Indonesian Songs of All Time .

 In 1994 , Anggun released Yang <unk> , a greatest hits album of her Indonesian hits . She later sold her record company to fund her move to Europe , and moved to London for about one year .

I had to spend so much on taking cabs and eating ! So I ended up taking buses everywhere and going to clubs to introduce myself as a singer . " She also admitted that she " had to convert from being a shy , introverted , ' real ' Javanese woman to being an unabashed , fearless , ' fake ' Javanese woman . " 
 She began writing songs and recording demos , but after a few months , all the demos she had sent to record companies around the UK were returned with negative replies . She began thinking about moving to another country , and initially considered moving to the Netherlands , but later decided on France .

 = Toronto Argonauts = 
 The Toronto Argonauts are a professional Canadian football team competing in the East Division of the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) . Based in Toronto , Ontario , the team was founded in 1873 , and is the oldest existing professional sports team in North America still using its original name . The team 's origins date back to a modified version of rugby football that emerged in North America in the latter half of the nineteenth century . The Argonauts played their home games at Rogers Centre from 1989 until 2016 when the team moved to BMO Field , the fifth stadium site to host the team . The current team is coached by Scott Milanovich and led at quarterback by Ricky Ray . 
 The Argonauts have won the Grey Cup a record 16 times and have appeared in the final 22 times . Most recently they defeated the Calgary Stampeders 35 – 22 at home in the 100th Grey Cup in 2012 . The Argonauts hold the best winning percentage in the championship game ( 72 @.@ 7 % ) and have the longest active winning streak in games in which they have appeared , at five . The Argonauts have faced every current western CFL team at least once in the Grey Cup , while their most celebrated divisional rivalry has been with the Hamilton Tiger @-@ Cats . 
 The team was owned by the Argonaut Rowing Club for its first 83 years , and has been owned by a series of business interests since 1956 . The Argonauts were a fixture on the Toronto sports scene for decades , with attendance peaking in the 1970s . In May 2015 it was announced that a consortium of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment 's Larry Tanenbaum ( via the Kilmer Group ) and Bell Canada would acquire the team . The sale included a scheduled move to MLSE run BMO Field for the 2016 season , which has long been proposed given attendance under @-@ utilization at Rogers Centre and plans to install natural grass at the domed stadium , rendering it unfit for football . 
 Given the length of franchise history , dozens of players , coaches , and management have been honoured in some form over the years . The team recognizes a select group of players with retired numbers : early greats Joe Krol and Dick Shatto , stalwart offensive lineman Danny Nykoluk , and Michael " Pinball " Clemons who has been the most recent face of the team . 
 = = Name and colours = = 
 Since the team 's foundation in 1873 , the " Argonauts " name has been in continuous use , a record in North American professional sports . The Chicago Cubs ( 1870 ) and the Atlanta Braves ( 1871 ) franchises of Major League Baseball are older , but both teams have changed their name more than once , and the Braves have also changed cities . The Argonauts also claim to be the oldest professional football team in North America . The claim is debatable , as the Hamilton Tigers date to 1869 ; they merged with the Hamilton Wildcats in 1950 to form the Hamilton Tiger @-@ Cats . 
 The name " Argonauts " is derived from Greek mythology : according to legend , Jason and the Argonauts were a group of heroes who set out to find the Golden Fleece aboard the ship Argo sometime before the Trojan War . Given its nautical theme , the name Argonaut was adopted by a group of amateur rowers in Toronto in 1872 . The Argonaut Rowing Club , which still exists today , went on to found the football club with the same name a year later . Given their roots in a rowing squad , the team is often referred to as the " boatmen " and less often the " scullers " . 
 In the 19th century , the most renowned rowing teams in the world were from the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in England . The Toronto rowers , many of whom had associations with the English schools , adopted uniforms incorporating the light blue of Cambridge and the dark blue of Oxford . In turn , the footballers adopted the colours and the phrase " double blue " would become synonymous with the team . Blue has become the traditional colour of top @-@ level teams in Toronto ( e.g. the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Blue Jays ) . 
 The team 's other official colour is white . Its current helmet design features an Oxford blue background , with an Oxford blue and Cambridge blue round shield inscribed with a white , capital letter A. For most of the team 's history , the logo featured some form of a boat , often incorporating a football .

 The first recorded game of what would become known as Canadian football was played in Toronto on November 9 , 1861 , featuring University of Toronto students . The game at the time was a modified version of English rugby and it gained popularity throughout the 1860s . Rugby itself was still an infant game having evolved out of association football ( soccer ) in the 1830s . Seeking a way to keep fit after summer , the Argonaut Rowing Club ( ARC ) formed their own rugby @-@ football squad on October 4 , 1873 . The Argonauts Football Club would play their first game against Hamilton on October 18 of that year ( a victory ) , beginning a storied rivalry . H.T. Glazebrook served as their first captain and head coach . Establishment of the football team was formalized by the ARC on September 17 , 1874 , with a subscription fee of one dollar charged per player . 
 The football team played a handful of challenge matches — one team inviting another to play — as an amateur squad against university and city teams every year throughout the 1870s , with one dormant year in 1879 , likely due to injuries . In 1883 the Toronto Football Club , other city teams from Ontario and university squads from Toronto , Queens University and Royal Military College formed the Ontario Rugby Football Union ( ORFU ) ; it was the first rugby football organization with a league and playoff structure in North America . The Toronto Football Club were league victors in the first year . Starting in 1884 a " Dominion Championship " — a precursor to the Grey Cup — was held , pitting the victors of the country 's two organized leagues , the ORFU and Quebec Rugby Football Union , against each other ; it was organized nationally by the Canadian Rugby Union ( CRU ) from 1892 onwards . In the first true national championship , the Montreal Football Club defeated the Toronto Football Club on November 5 , 1884 by a score of 30 – 0 . Argonauts would lose the Dominion Title in 1901 to Ottawa College . The Ottawa team and the Hamilton Tigers were frequent opponents in this era . 
 Over the thirty years from 1880 onwards , rule changes were incrementally introduced into the game , including the adoption of the line of scrimmage , scoring that began to resemble the modern version , and the down and yardage structure . Popular personalities of the era included player @-@ coach Joe Wright Sr. , one of the best all around Canadian athletes at the turn of the century . One major outstanding issue within the CRU at the time was the role of professional versus amateur players ; this dispute caused the Argonauts to withdraw from the league in 1903 and eventually led to the establishment of a new league , The Big Four or Interprovincial Rugby Football League . Alongside the professionalism dispute , there was serious disagreement over the adoption of the Burnside rules , with Ontario , Quebec , and the intercollegiate league often not in alignment . Amongst other critical innovations , the Burnside rules reduced the number of men per side to 12 and introduced the ten yards in three downs structure that is central to the modern game . 
 = = = 1907 – 1952 = = = 
 Seeking looser rules regarding the employment of professional players , Toronto and other cities split from the ORFU and formed the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union ( IRFU ) in 1907 . These clubs were the vaunted " Big Four " — Toronto , Hamilton , Ottawa , and Montreal — that formed the precursor to Eastern Division of the Canadian Football League . 
 The IRFU continued under the larger auspices of the Canadian Rugby Union . Beginning in 1909 , the CRU champion was awarded the Grey Cup , with the Big Four competing against university squads and eventually teams from Western Canada . The Argonauts first competed for the Cup in 1911 , losing 14 to 7 to the University of Toronto in front of a then record 13 @,@ 687 spectators at the newly opened Varsity Stadium . The team would claim their first championship in 1914 , exacting revenge on U of T with a 14 to 2 victory . Their star runner and kicker in their first championship year was Jack O 'Conner , who scored a league record 44 points . 
 After play was halted during World War I , the Argos again achieved success in the early 1920s on the back of one Canada 's greatest ever sportsmen . Lionel Conacher , the " Big Train , " led the team to two perfect 6 – 0 seasons in 1921 and 1922 . In the first season he accounted for 85 of his team 's 167 points , and 15 of the points in the Grey Cup game , a 23 – 0 drubbing of the Edmonton Eskimos . It was the first east @-@ west Grey Cup championship in Canadian history . 
 The 1921 Grey Cup victory was their last until 1933 , at which point the Argonauts became the dominant team of an increasingly nationwide sport . They put together a number of Grey Cup dynasties in the 1930s and 1940s , winning eight of twenty Grey Cups between 1933 and 1952 . The Winnipeg Blue Bombers were most often on the receiving end of Argo Grey Cup victories in this era . From 1933 to 1941 Lew Hayman coached the team with a still unparalleled winning ratio of 45 – 15 – 2 . Their first back @-@ to @-@ back Grey Cups came in 1937 and 1938 . This was also the era of the famed Stukus brothers — Annis , Bill , and Frank — who proved a potent all @-@ purpose trio in the Argonauts ' championship years . 
 Joe " King " Krol and Royal Copeland , the so @-@ called Gold Dust Twins , were the best @-@ known players of the 1940s . In an era where players still played multiple positions , they were a threat in every capacity : running , passing , catching , kicking , and playing defence . Often connecting with each other for points , they led the Argos to a Grey Cup threepeat between 1945 and 1947 . 1949 and 1950 marked a watershed in Argonauts history as the team began large scale importation of American players for the first time . The team also broke a cultural barrier in 1950 with the signing of their first black player : Ulysses " Crazy Legs " Curtis would play five strong years with the team . 
 Frank Clair was brought in as coach in 1950 and left his mark on the revamped roster ; he led the team to Grey Cup wins in 1950 and 1952 . The first of these was a 13 – 0 victory over Winnipeg in the notorious Mud Bowl . A November snow storm followed by mild conditions turned Varsity Stadium into a bog and the play was a shambles ; one Winnipeg player is reported to have almost drowned in the muck . 
 At some time during this period , the phrase " Argo Bounce " came to refer to the Argonauts ' propensity to receive a lucky bounce of the football . The phrase may date to the Grey Cups of the 1930s , all of which featured improbable bounces and fumbles favouring the Argos ; the phrase was popularized in print by Annis Stukus in the 1940s . It is still in use today , with a number of fortunate on @-@ field happenings attributed to the " bounce " . 
 = = = 1953 – 1988 = = = 
 The three decades after the 1952 Grey Cup victory have been called the Argonauts ' Dark Ages . The team went thirty @-@ one years between championship victories and nineteen without even making an appearance in the final . Part of the reason was a salary cap introduced in 1953 that cost them many talented players . For the first time in decades , they began ranking at the bottom of the Eastern Division . The management style under new owner John Bassett has also been blamed : young talent was traded or allowed to leave and the team could not form a nucleus of championship players ; coaches came and went rapidly . Two notable events occurred off @-@ field at the end of the 1950s : in 1958 the Argonauts became a founding member of the Canadian Football League and a year later found a new home at Exhibition Stadium . 
 The Argonauts did have some standout players in the 1950s and 1960s . The stalwart of the era was Dick Shatto , an Ohioan who played twelve seasons from 1954 to 1965 . Listed as a running back , Shatto was a dual threat to run and receive and continues to hold the team regular season records for touchdowns ( 91 ) and total yards gained ( 6 @,@ 958 ) . Living in Toronto year round , Shatto set down deep roots in the city and would eventually serve as the Argonauts general manager . Another American , Tobin Rote , set numerous passing marks in three years at quarterback from 1960 to 1962 . Known for his good living off the field , Rote still holds the Argos single game passing record with 524 yards against Montreal on August 19 , 1960 . A pillar on the offensive line was Danny Nykoluk at tackle who appeared in an incredible 17 seasons from 1954 to 1971 , including one stretch of 12 years where he didn 't miss a single game . Despite these veterans , the era was marked by losing seasons and high attrition on the roster . By the 1960s , the annual ( and often desperate ) mid @-@ season addition of American imports had become known as the " Argo airlift " ; American imports often wouldn 't last a game before being cut . 
 Eventually , the team became competitive again under head coach Leo Cahill in the late 1960s . They scored a coup over the National Football League ( NFL ) with the signing of a young Joe Theismann ( and other American stars ) in 1971 . The team also saw an attendance bounce , consistently selling out Exhibition Stadium . The Boatmen 's best chance to end their Grey Cup drought came that year , when they faced the Calgary Stampeders in the 59th Grey Cup , the first to be played on artificial turf . In a defensive struggle at Vancouver 's soggy Empire Stadium , a now infamous late fumble by Leon " X @-@ Ray " <unk> and a possession changing kick out of bounds by Harry <unk> sealed a 14 – 11 Stampeder victory . 
 The 1970s were tumultuous for the team , with numerous hirings and firings of head coaches and consistent losing records . There were stellar players over this era , including all @-@ stars on defence such as Jim <unk> , Jim <unk> , and Granville " Granny " <unk> , but the team could not return to winning form . High profile moves such as hiring Canadian football icon Russ Jackson as head coach in 1975 or signing running back superstar Anthony Davis the next year turned into busts . Ironically , the Argos reached historic attendance highs in this losing decade — regular season average per game attendance reached 47 @,@ 356 in 1976 . The enlargement of Exhibition Stadium over 1975 and 1976 in anticipation of the Blue Jays expansion baseball team allowed for these massive crowds . 
 The Argos reached an all @-@ time low in 1981 when they finished 2 – 14 ; this despite having such talented players as quarterback Condredge Holloway , running back Cedric Minter , and receiver Terry Greer . The team began the year 0 – 10 and there was talk of a " perfect " losing season . The team had been inept so long by this point ( 29 seasons without a Grey Cup win ) that the notion of an " Argo Bounce " had become inverted ; now " it was the unluckiest bounce in the world , the one that usually arose from the Argos ' uncanny ability to lose critical games in the dying minutes by committing an improbable blunder . " 
 However , with the 1982 season came the hiring of Bob O 'Billovich as head coach and Mouse Davis as offensive co @-@ ordinator . Davis implemented the run and shoot offense , and the Argos enjoyed a turnaround , going 9 – 6 – 1 that year ; Condredge Holloway was the CFL 's most outstanding player . The team ultimately fell short in their quest for a Grey Cup , losing 32 – 16 to the mighty Edmonton Eskimos in the final in front of a disappointed crowd at Exhibition Stadium . The 1983 season finally brought the championship home . The Argos finished 12 – 4 and Terry Greer set a CFL record with 2 @,@ 003 receiving yards . Joe Barnes and Condredge Holloway were a potent duo at quarterback . The Double Blue returned to the Grey Cup , this time facing the BC Lions at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver . Despite the hostile crowd , Toronto defeated BC 18 – 17 to win their first Grey Cup since 1952 . The Argos were generally competitive for the remainder of the 1980s , thanks in large part to talented players such as Gill " The Thrill " <unk> and Darrell K. Smith , but a return to the glory of 1983 proved elusive . 
 = = = 1989 – present = = = 
 The 1989 season saw the Argonauts move into the SkyDome , a multi @-@ purpose downtown stadium with a retractable roof . It marked the beginning of an eventful few years . In 1990 , one of the most beloved figures in Toronto sporting history emerged on the team : Michael " Pinball " Clemons set a CFL record for all purpose yards with 3 @,@ 300 in his first full year , a record he would break in 1997 with 3 @,@ 840 . 
 In 1991 Hollywood prestige arrived in the form of a new ownership trio . Bruce McNall , owner of the NHL 's Los Angeles Kings , bought the team . One of his players , hockey great Wayne Gretzky , became a minority owner , as did Canadian @-@ born comedian John Candy . The group stunned the league with the signing of Raghib " Rocket " Ismail for an unheard of $ 18 @.@ 2 million over four years . Ismail immediately impressed , particularly on kickoff returns , and was named player of the game in the 1991 Grey Cup , which the Argos won 36 – 21 over the Calgary Stampeders . Clemons and quarterback Matt Dunigan ( who played the final with a broken collarbone ) were the other critical pieces to the championship . 
 However , the Argos slumped to 6 – 12 only a year later , beginning a slide that only accelerated when Dunigan and Ismail left after the season . The 1992 season was the first of four consecutive losing seasons ; while they made the playoffs in 1994 , they were promptly eliminated by the Baltimore Stallions in the division semifinals . Trouble also struck off the field : McNall was convicted of conspiracy and fraud at the end of 1993 , while Candy died prematurely the next year . Attendance also began to slide in the mid @-@ 1990s , raising questions over the team 's viability that persist to this day . The per game average was just above 16 @,@ 000 in 1994 and 1995 , much less than half the team 's 1970s peak . 
 Championship material did eventually reemerge in 1996 . Doug Flutie , one of the greatest quarterbacks in CFL history , was signed for the season and surrounded with key personnel . The team included linebacker Mike O 'Shea , veteran wide receiver Paul <unk> , and running back Robert Drummond . Derrell " Mookie " Mitchell was added at receiver in 1997 . The Boatmen took the Grey Cup in both 1996 and 1997 . Flutie would set team records for single season passing yards with more than 5 @,@ 500 in each year and for touchdowns thrown with 47 in 1997 ( one less than his CFL record of 48 ) before crossing the border to join the Buffalo Bills the next year . <unk> retired in 1999 as the team 's all time pass reception yardage leader . Clemons ended his own successful career in 2000 before returning to coach until 2007 . 
 The years after their back @-@ to @-@ back championships saw a return to mediocrity for the Argos . Ticket sales remained flat , and there were changes in ownership . <unk> to attract fans were greeted with criticism . The Argos seemingly bottomed out in July 2003 when the CFL stripped control over the team from owner Sherwood Schwarz . The team had amassed debts of over $ 20 million , including $ 17 @.@ 4 owed to Schwarz himself . 
 New ownership under David Cynamon and Howard Sokolowski brought immediate dividends with another Grey Cup win in 2004 . Veteran Damon Allen led the team to a team to 27 – 19 victory over the B.C. Lions , with Jon Avery a critical running threat . Allen would continue with the team until 2007 , and retired with professional football 's all @-@ time leading passing yardage ( 72 @,@ 381 ) . 
 The Argonauts saw winning seasons from 2005 to 2007 before bottoming out the next two years . They finished 2009 with just three wins . Critical players over this half decade included receiver <unk> Bruce III , defensive star Byron Parker , and all @-@ star punter Noel Prefontaine . The team generated some controversy in 2006 when they lured running back Ricky Williams from the NFL . Williams had repeatedly violated NFL drug policies and was under suspension for the year ; he played just one season with the Argos . 
 In 2010 the team again saw an ownership change , with construction magnate David Braley , who also owns the Lions , taking control . After breaking even in 2010 and going 6 – 12 in 2011 , the Argonauts again acquired a championship nucleus in 2012 . Ricky Ray was brilliant at quarterback while Chad Owens emerged as arguably the league 's best special teams player . Owens broke Michael Clemons CFL record for all purpose yards and won the CFL Most Outstanding Player award that year . The 2012 Grey Cup was played in Toronto and the team took their first championship victory in the city since 1952 , a 35 – 22 win over Calgary . 
 = = Championship summary = = 
 The Toronto Argonauts currently lead the Canadian Football League in total wins and in winning percentage in the Grey Cup . Early success in the final can partly be attributed to the weakness of western teams : between 1921 and 1952 the Argonauts won in nine straight appearances , including six straight against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers . The team 's success is not merely an historical aberration , however : they have won six of their nine appearances since the formation of the CFL , including their last five straight . 
 For the entire Grey Cup era there has been some form of playoffs leading up to the Grey Cup game ; the 22 Argonauts teams who have won a spot in the final would , in modern terms , be called " Eastern Division Champions " . It is important to remember , however , that the route to the Grey Cup , participating teams , and playoff format have changed repeatedly over time . 
 As for the regular season , the CFL records 14 Argonauts teams at the top of the eastern divisional table since its formation in 1958 . Earlier data for the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union provides another 9 years from 1907 to 1957 in which the Argos were the best of the " Big Four , " for a total of 23 divisional wins . The only pre @-@ 1958 year in which the Argos won the IRFU but failed to make a Grey Cup appearance was 1922 , when they lost in semi @-@ final to Queen 's University . 
 Going back to an even earlier era , the Argonauts won the Ontario Rugby Football Union championship three times between 1883 and 1906 , including the league 's first two seasons , 1883 and 1884 . Their last victory as ORFU members came in 1901 . Given their losses in the Dominion Championship in 1884 and 1901 , the Argonauts would not earn the title " national champion " until their first Grey Cup win in 1914 . 
 = = Stadiums = = 
 The Toronto Argonauts ' first home was Rosedale Field at Mount Pleasant Road and MacLennan Avenue near the city centre . The team suggests its capacity was 10 @,@ 000 total with 4 @,@ 000 seated , though O 'Leary and Parrish list smaller numbers , noting that a $ 32 @,@ 000 renovation in 1883 allowed for a capacity of 2 @,@ 000 . The field has historic significance as the site of the first Grey Cup game in 1909 ; the CFL lists the game 's attendance as 3 @,@ 807 . The field still exists as part of Rosedale Park , although there are no grandstands . 
 Sources again differ on when the team permanently moved to Varsity Stadium on the grounds of the University of Toronto . The team gives dates of 1874 – 1897 and 1908 – 1915 at Rosedale , while other sources suggest the team had moved to Varsity by 1911 . Varsity would become indelibly linked with the Argonauts and the early years of Canadian football ; it was the home field of the great Argo dynasties of the 1930s and 1940s . For most of the Argos time at the stadium , its capacity was about 16 @,@ 000 , but this jumped above 20 @,@ 000 with a renovation in 1950 . Although it has not hosted a professional game since 1958 , it still holds the record for hosting the most Grey Cups with 30 . 
 Another home beckoned in 1959 with the renovation of the new Exhibition Stadium to accommodate Canadian football . Often remembered ruefully by Torontonians for its exposure to weather and poor sightlines , the stadium was nevertheless the site of the Argos ' greatest attendance in the late 1960s and 1970s . Particularly brutal conditions at the 70th Grey Cup in 1982 paved the way for the construction of a domed stadium in Toronto . 
 SkyDome ( Rogers Centre since 2004 ) has provided the Argonauts a marquee venue since 1989 , but also been criticized for its football sightlines and atmosphere . Even crowds of about 30 @,@ 000 can look sparse in a stadium that seats up to 50 @,@ 000 people . The domed environment does , at least , remove the elements and is an advantage to passers and comfortable for fans . Two critical opportunities to find a new home were missed in 2004 and 2005 : plans for a revamped Varsity Stadium to accommodate CFL @-@ sized crowds were thwarted by community opposition in 2004 , and the Argonauts withdrew from an alternate plan at York University the following year . 
 It was announced in 2013 that the Rogers Centre 's artificial turf would be replaced by natural grass within five years to better facilitate Toronto Blue Jays baseball . This will require the stadium 's movable stands to be permanently locked into position for baseball , making it impossible to host CFL games . The stadium issue generated significant press and raised concerns over the team 's long @-@ term viability given that the Argonauts losses have been estimated anywhere from $ 2 to $ 6 million annually . While various stadium rumours swirled over the course of David Braley 's tenure ( including building a new facility ) it became increasingly clear that a move to a renovated BMO Field was the only viable option . 
 The BMO Field move became finalized on May 20 , 2015 , concurrent with the announcement of the team 's sale to a consortium of MLSE shareholders Larry Tanenbaum and Bell Canada . The team will move following the completion of stadium renovations for the 2016 season . The $ 120 million renovation plan had originally been announced in March 2014 . The upgrades raise the stadium 's seating capacity from 21 @,@ 566 seats to 30 @,@ 000 for soccer , with 25 @,@ 000 seats in CFL configuration , and will be temporarily expandable with additional endzone seating to 40 @,@ 000 for big events such as a Grey Cup . The agreement requires MLSE to reach a " long @-@ term use ( i.e. 20 years ) " lease with the Argos for usage of the stadium . The inclusion of the CFL configuration had partly been at the insistence of the City of Toronto , which owns BMO Field , and had been planned in the original stadium agreement . 
 Following the demolition and reconstruction of the 5 @,@ 000 seat Varsity Stadium at the University of Toronto , the Argos returned to the stadium , hosting preseason games from 2013 to 2015 . The team also acquired a much @-@ needed training facility in July 2014 when it was announced that MLSE had partnered with the Argonauts to expand KIA Training Ground , Toronto FC 's new state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art academy and training facility .

 For more than eight decades , the Toronto Argonauts Football Club was the sole property of its namesake rowing club . By the 1950s , the team 's complex management structure made the arrangement increasingly awkward . Facing overdraft and with wealthy suitors knocking , the Argonaut rowers finally sold the team to a consortium led by John Bassett , Eric Cradock , and Charlie Burns in 1957 . Each held about 20 % share in the company , with the balance made up by small investors who had some affinity with the club ; the initial agreement called for a long @-@ term debenture of $ 400 @,@ 000 to be set up that would sustain the rowing club in the absence of its football income . Bassett was the operating head of the franchise and is often given sole credit for the initial purchase of the Argos , but Cradock was also instrumental in spearheading the drive . He would sell his share to Len <unk> just two years into his tenure in part because of Bassett 's controlling nature . Bassett arranged a complete buyout of the other shareholders for $ 2 @.@ 31 million in 1971 through his holdings in Baton Broadcasting . 
 The Bassett years of the late @-@ 50s to early @-@ 70s were marked by mediocrity on the field but consistent success at the turnstiles . An issue that has become a perennial concern in the city also emerged at this time : the possibility of a National Football League team in Toronto . Various machinations were entertained by Bassett including moving the Argos to the NFL , bringing an American expansion team to the city ( e.g. the Toronto Northmen of the WFL ) , or expanding the CFL itself in the opposite direction . Other team owners steadfastly opposed Bassett 's moves and almost rescinded his franchise in 1974 ; angered , he sold the team for $ 3 @.@ 3 million to hotel magnate William R. Hodgson in the same year . 
 <unk> sold to Carling O 'Keefe in 1979 , who had been minority owners since 1976 . The brewing company 's total investment in the team was $ 5 @.@ 8 million . At the time it was rapidly ramping up its sports sponsorship ( it also owned the Quebec Nordiques before they moved from the World Hockey Association to the NHL ) and would become a huge benefactor to the CFL itself , inking television rights deals that would reach $ 11 million annually by 1984 . Reports at the time suggest the league became spoiled by the partnership and that when the money dried up in 1987 , the transition was difficult . For the Argos , the Carling O 'Keefe years were marked by their first modern @-@ era Grey Cup in 1983 . 
 The year 's following the Carling O 'Keefe era were marked by increasingly short ownership stints . Canadian businessman Harry Ornest bought the team off Carling O 'Keefe for $ 5 million at the end of 1988 and then sold to the trio of McNall ( 60 % ) , Candy ( 20 % ) , and Gretzky ( 20 % ) for the same amount in 1991 . Of the three , Candy is best remembered for his emotional investment in the team and a team player award continues in his honour . Given McNall 's indictment and Candy 's early death , the era was tumultuous and the last in which the club regularly made front page headlines . The now money @-@ losing team was sold to the Labatt Brewing Company through its TSN unit in 1994 for $ 4 @.@ 5 million . At the time , Labatt also owned the Toronto Blue Jays . In 1995 , Labatt was acquired by Interbrew ; The Interbrew years saw two championships but also the worst Argo attendance of the modern era . Interbrew soon lost interest in sports ownership and the team was sold again at the end of 1999 to New York businessman Sherwood Schwarz . 
 After the debacles of the Schwarz era and brief control of the team by the CFL ( see above ) the Argos were rescued by David Cynamon and Howard Sokolowski in 2004 . There was optimism surrounding the duo 's arrival and attendance figures improved in their six years heading the organization . It was also appreciated that the two were Torontonians after a quarter @-@ century of foreign and / or corporate ownership . But by 2010 losses were great enough that the team was again put on the block and eventually sold to David Braley . There was some controversy surrounding Braley 's takeover . He is simultaneously owner of the BC Lions , raising questions of competitive integrity . It was also revealed that Braley had bankrolled half of Cynamon and Sokolowski 's initial $ 2 million buy @-@ in of the Argos in 2004 , and covered half their subsequent losses , in exchange for half of the 2007 Grey Cup profits . 
 By 2014 Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment and its chairman and minority owner Larry Tanenbaum had emerged as serious suitors for the team . On May 20 , 2015 , it was announced that an agreement had been reached for Argonauts to be sold to Tanenbaum 's Kilmer Sports and Bell Canada , who both own a stake in MLSE with Rogers Communications . Financial details were not disclosed . Despite its shared stake in MLSE , Rogers was not interested in having an ownership share in the Argonauts because it does not have any media relationships with the CFL ( unlike Bell , whose TSN division holds the broadcast rights to the league ) . Argonauts Holdings Limited Partnership , a holding company which Bell and Kilmer each own 50 % of , formally acquired the franchise on December 31 , 2015 . 
 = = = Senior executives = = = 
 Below the ownership level , the two most senior positions within the Toronto Argonauts organization are its president and general manager . The GM role was titled as " managing director " from 1957 to 1971 , while the president role is now included in the title of CEO . 
 The longest serving executive in the organization is Lew Hayman , who had a five decade career beginning in the 1930s as coach and administrator . A Jewish @-@ American , Hayman served with both the Argos and Montreal Alouettes and has been called " the architect of Canadian football . " He was the team 's first president and managing director at the insistence of Eric Cradock in 1957 , and would continue in the former role until 1981 . Ralph <unk> took over from Hayman and is another hall of fame builder . 
 After relative stability at the senior executive level for three decades , there has been significant turnover in the positions since the 1990s . The team had eight general managers in eight years , for example , between 1996 and 2003 . The current GM is Jim Barker , who was appointed at the end of 2010 . Chris Rudge , former head of the Canadian Olympic Committee , took over as president and CEO from the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2015 , when Michael Copeland took over . 
 = = = Head coaches = = = 
 55 men have served as Toronto Argonauts head coach . The current coach , Scott Milanovich , was appointed in 2011 . He has succeeded in reviving a stalled offence and led the team to a Grey Cup victory in 2012 . 
 The longest total tenure at head coach belongs to Bob O 'Billovich , who led the team for eleven years over three stints in the 1980s and early 90s . Other notable coaching careers include those of Joe Wright , Sr. at the end of the nineteenth century , Ted Morris and Frank Clair in the post @-@ war years , Leo Cahill in the late 60s and early 70s , and Pinball Clemons after the turn of the millennium . 
 Since 1961 , the Canadian Football League has awarded the Annis Stukus Trophy annually to the league 's outstanding coach . ( Alongside his playing career , Stukus achieved fame as a coach , promoter , and newspaper columnist . ) Argonauts coaches have been honoured seven times : Cahill ( 1971 ) , O 'Billovich ( 1981 & 1987 ) , Adam Rita ( 1991 ) , Don Matthews ( 1997 ) , Jim Barker ( 2010 ) , and Milanovich ( 2012 ) .

 = = = Roster = = = 
 During the season , active roster sizes in the CFL are 46 and game day rosters number 42 , at least 20 of whom must be Canadian in accordance with the league 's " national player " rule ( formerly called the " non @-@ import " rule prior to 2014 ) . Training camp rosters are allowed to swell to 68 . 
 The current team is led at quarterback by Ricky Ray , who had three statistically brilliant seasons between 2012 and 2014 , earning eastern Most Outstanding Player nominations in the latter two years . Injuries have begun to take a toll on the QB and he enters the 2015 recovering from shoulder surgery ; attention has shifted to backup Trevor Harris who has waited three years for a chance at starting opportunities . 
 The Argonauts receiving corps , which was decimated by injuries in 2014 , saw significant turnover in the off @-@ season including the loss of standout John Chiles to an opportunity with the Chicago Bears . Chad Owens and Canadian Andre Durie are set to return but the rest of the unit is a bevy of untested imports , many of whom do not have a pro pass reception on their record . One important offensive piece remains in place for the 2015 season with the resigning of running back Curtis Steele . 
 An off @-@ season move on defense saw the trade for defensive linebacker Shea Emry , who led the team in tackles in 2014 , for defensive end Ricky Foley ; Foley has had previous success with the Toronto squad . Another change on the defensive side was the promotion of Casey <unk> to Defensive Coordinator . The team has been troubled in recent years by turnover in their defensive personnel and coaches . Tristan <unk> , the 2014 sack leader for the team , remained on the roster until the end of the 2015 CFL season .

 = = Rivalries = = 
 With few teams , but a long history , it is inevitable that intense rivalries have developed in Canadian football . Far and away the greatest Toronto Argonauts rivalry has been with the Hamilton Tiger @-@ Cats and its precursor teams . Fittingly , the Argonauts first game was against a club from Hamilton , while the raucous Eastern Final of 2013 — featuring a Tiger @-@ Cat win over the Argos in front of 35 @,@ 000 at the Rogers Centre — proved the rivalry is alive and well . The two teams meet in Hamilton every year in the Labour Day Classic , a league wide tradition since the late 1940s in which the game 's greatest rivalries are showcased . 
 To the east , the Argonauts have also faced off against teams from Montreal and Ottawa since their earliest days . In recent years , the Montreal Alouettes have consistently fielded strong teams and often run up against the Argos in the playoffs ; the teams have faced off eleven times in the Eastern Final , with Montreal taking six . 
 In 2014 , The Argonauts reignited their historic rivalry with an Ottawa Football Team as the team came back as the Ottawa <unk> ( Other rivalries with Ottawa consisted of rivalries with the Ottawa Renegades and the Ottawa Rough Riders ) . In 5 games against the current Ottawa franchise ; the Argos maintain a winning record of 4 @-@ 1 @-@ 0 . The Argonauts won their last meeting with the Redblacks by a final score of 38 @-@ 35 in front of a crowd of 15 @,@ 001 people at TD Place in Ottawa on October 6th , 2015 . 
 At the Grey Cup level , the Argonauts have faced an assortment of teams in recent decades rather than any one team regularly . The Edmonton Eskimos , for years a dominant team in the league , became a rival . The two teams ' five Grey Cup match @-@ ups include an epic 38 – 36 Toronto loss in 1987 and most recently , the Snow Bowl victory in 1996 led by the arm of Doug Flutie . In the pre @-@ CFL days , the Argos had a Grey Cup rivalry with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and a cross @-@ town rivalry with the University of Toronto in the first years of the Grey Cup championship , including the Argonauts ' first win in 1914 . 
 = = Notable personnel = = 
 The highest distinction the Toronto Argonauts can accord a player is to retire their number ; just four players have received the honour . Starting in 1996 , the team began another category of distinction with its list of " All @-@ Time Argos . " Twenty @-@ two players have been rewarded so far and a banner in their honour hangs at Rogers Centre . 
 Players and management personnel may be separately inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame . A total of 56 people who have been part of the team are in the Hall . The All @-@ Time Argos list does not extend back to before the Second War era while the Hall of Fame does . Thus , for instance , Lionel Conacher is in the Hall but not listed as an All @-@ Time Argo . 
 Finally , players may be honoured on an annual basis through the CFL awards . The most prestigious of these is the Most Outstanding Player Award , awarded since 1953 . Six Argonauts have been recipients : Chad Owens ( 2012 ) , Damon Allen ( 2005 ) , Doug Flutie ( 1996 & 1997 ) , Pinball Clemons ( 1990 ) , <unk> Holloway , and Bill Symons ( 1968 ) .

 = Windows Push Notification Service = 
 Windows Push Notification Service ( commonly referred to as Windows Notification Service or WNS ) is a service developed by Microsoft for the Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Windows Mobile platforms . It allows for developers to send push data ( " toast " and " tile " updates ) to Windows and Windows Mobile applications which implement the feature . Designed as a successor to the Microsoft Push Notification Service , it was first supported on Windows 8 and subsequently on Windows Phone 8 @.@ 1 upon its release . 
 = = Technical details = = 
 = = = Design and compatibility = = = 
 The Windows Push Notification Service ( WNS ) was designed as a successor to the Microsoft Push Notification Service ( MPNS ) , which was only supported natively on the Windows Phone 8 Operating System . Developers can still use the MPNS on apps that are installed on newer versions of Windows Mobile ( Windows Phone 8 or Windows Phone 8 @.@ 1 ) , but only if the Windows application was already registered to use the MPNS and has been converted to a Microsoft <unk> application and modified to re @-@ target the new platform . 
 In 2015 , Microsoft announced that the WNS would be expanded to utilize the Universal Windows Platform architecture , allowing for push data to be sent to Windows 10 , Windows 10 Mobile , <unk> , as well as other supported platforms using universal API calls and POST requests . 
 During the 2015 Build keynote , Microsoft announced a Universal Windows Platform bridge that would allow Android and iOS software to be ported to Windows 10 Mobile and published to the Windows Store . In August 2015 , A version of the Microsoft Android bridge toolset was reported to be leaked and available on the internet along with its documentation . The leaked toolset required developers to register and use the WNS to send notification data to ported applications , and would not allow for Google Cloud Messaging to be used instead . Microsoft later discontinued the Android bridge project in favor of continuing support for iOS application porting instead . 
 During the 2016 Build keynote , Microsoft announced an update to the WNS and the Windows 10 Operating System that will allow for Android and iOS devices to forward push notifications received to Windows 10 to be viewed and discarded . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 The architecture of the Windows Push Notification Service is similar to that of its predecessor , in that it consists of servers and interfaces that generate , maintain , store , and authenticate unique identifiers ( called Channel URI <unk> ) for all devices that register to use the service . When a device enrolls to receive data and notification information using the WNS , it first sends a device registration request to WNS network . The WNS network acknowledges the request , and responds with the device 's unique Channel URI Identifier . Typically , the device will then send its identifier to a server owned by the developer so that it can be stored and used for sending notifications . When the app developer wishes to transmit a notification or other WNS data to the device , it will transmit a POST request to the WNS network . The network will acknowledge and authenticate the request . If the authentication succeeds , the data to be transmitted is <unk> and then sent to the device from the WNS network using the Channel URI Identifier . 
 = Queen 's Park Oval = 
 The Queen 's Park Oval is a sports stadium in Port of Spain , Trinidad and Tobago . Privately owned by the Queen 's Park Cricket Club , it is currently the largest capacity cricket ground in the West Indies with seating for about 18 @,@ 000 . 
 It has hosted more Test matches than any other ground in the Caribbean , and also hosted a number of One @-@ Day International ( ODI ) matches , including many World Series Cricket games in 1979 and matches of the 2007 Cricket World Cup . The Trinidad and Tobago cricket team play most of their home matches at the ground , and it is the home ground of the Caribbean Premier League team Trinidad and Tobago Red Steel . 
 Considered by many players , journalists and critics as one of the most picturesque cricket venues , the ground first hosted a Test match in February 1930 when England toured the Caribbean , though it had previously hosted many first class tours as early as the 1897 tour under Lord Hawke . The pavilion dates back to 1896 , though there were extensive renovations in the 1950s and in 2007 prior to the World Cup and following an earthquake . The " Concrete Stand " was renamed the " Learie Constantine Stand " in recognition of that former West Indies cricketer . The first ODI match at the ground was played in March 1983 , and the first Twenty20 International in 2009 . 
 As well as the main cricket stadium , the facility includes a gym , indoor and outdoor cricket practice nets , two squash courts and two outdoor tennis courts . The cricket field has also been used to host several domestic and international football matches , and several music events . 
 = = Cricketing history = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 The Queen 's Park Oval Cricket Club leased the Queen 's Park Oval in 1896 , moving there from its first home at the Queen 's Park Savannah , where it had existed since its founding in 1891 . The natural soil at the ground prevented turf wickets from being laid down , due to the damage caused by the mole crickets that inhabited it , so when the club moved to its new ground the groundsmen laid a pitch of clay with a wicket made of matting prepared on top . A popular venue due to its capacity ( 7 @,@ 000 when first constructed , the highest in the Caribbean ) the ground was very profitable for the owning cricket club . The first match recorded by Cricket Archive , CricInfo and Wisden took place on 29 January 1897 , between Lord Hawke 's touring party and a team put out by the Queen 's Park Oval Club . The match , which was a draw but saw the ground 's first century — 119 by Plum Warner — was not counted as first @-@ class . Only a few days later on February 1 the ground 's maiden first @-@ class fixture took place between Trinidad and the same Lord Hawke 's XI . The home team won by 137 runs . The two teams met at the Oval again on 5 February , when Trinidad were victorious once more . Arthur Priestley 's touring eleven then played a Queen 's Park XI on February 12 , with the game drawn . 
 During the first decades of the 20th century , the private Queen 's Park Oval was a very exclusive cricket ground and club . C. L. R. James records that " they were for the most part white and often wealthy " and that " a black man in the Queen 's Park was rare and usually anonymous . " The Queens Park club was " the big shot " of the local cricket on the island , and touring matches were the mainstay of cricket at the ground for the first few years . They also contributed to the growth of cricket on the island , for trial matches were held on weekends while a tour was in progress , and local talent was invited to play . In April 1899 , Trinidad played a Barbados @-@ based XI led by Arthur St. Hill , an early domestic West Indian fixture . By 1900 , Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament matches were taking place , with the final between Barbados and British Guiana taking place at the Queen 's Park Oval . These became more and more frequent in the first decade of the 20th century , along with more tour games against the invitational <unk> of Richard Bennett and Lord Brackley . The ground hosted the finals of the 1906 and 1910 Inter @-@ Colonial Tournaments . 
 In 1911 and in 1913 the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) toured the West Indies , with four matches played in total between the MCC and Trinidad at the Queen 's Park Oval across both tours . Then , on 20 February 1913 , the MCC played a combined West Indies cricket team , who was playing one of its earliest matches as a representative eleven , and only its fourth against an MCC side . Harry Ince scored 167 in the West Indian first innings , Richard Ollivierre took a five @-@ wicket haul and Joseph Rogers took a six @-@ for as the MCC slid to a heavy defeat . The match was the first between the West Indies and the MCC to have taken place at the Queen 's Park Oval . Though cricket was largely interrupted by World War I , normal practice resumed with the ground hosting the Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament finals in 1921 , 1925 and 1929 . 
 = = = Test matches = = = 
 On 1 February 1930 , the Queen 's Park Oval hosted its first Test match . The second Test of the MCC 1929 – 30 tour of the West Indies saw England under Les Ames defeat the West Indies under Errol Hunte thanks largely to a century by the England captain and a double @-@ century by Patsy Hendren . The ground also hosted the Second Test of the 1935 tour , which started on 24 January . This time the West Indies recorded its first Test match victory at the ground , defeating Bob Wyatt 's England by 217 runs . Between the Tests , the ground had also hosted several of the first @-@ class matches of the tour , as well as continuing to host matches of the Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament , including the 1935 and 1937 finals . 
 The outbreak of World War II halted Test cricket at the ground after this 1935 tour , however domestic cricket continued . 1939 represented the last year of the Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament , and throughout the war years the Queen 's Park Oval hosted several first @-@ class games between Trinidad and either Barbados or British Guiana . International cricket would not return to the ground until 1947 when the MCC returned and played Trinidad twice at the ground in the lead up to the first post @-@ war Test at the Queen 's Park Oval on 11 February 1948 . England drew with the West Indies — under Clyde Walcott — despite centuries from both West Indian openers . In 1952 , the original pavilion was replaced with a two @-@ tier structure as part of an extensive renovation of the ground . In 1953 India toured the West Indies and played the First and Third Tests at the ground . On 17 May 1954 , the Oval then hosted England once more and the home team scored 681 / 8d , which remains the highest team score at the ground . Everton Weekes scored 206 of the runs , the second of two double centuries scored by him at the Oval , following a knock of 207 during the aforementioned tour by India . This was the final match played on the clay surface with matting laid on top . From then on greater effort was made to prepare turf wickets in an attempt to balance batting and bowling at the Oval . More advanced techniques were introduced and a new pitch laid in 1955 . Later that year the ground hosted the second Test of an Australian tour . Pakistan came in 1957 , followed by England two years later . On 28 January 1960 , during the latter tour , England faced the West Indies at the Oval . Batting in front of a 30 @,@ 000 @-@ strong home crowd on the third day , the West Indies fell from 22 for no loss to 98 / 8 . The crowd began to throw bottles onto the pitch , some ran on to the field , and general disorder spread until the game had to be halted . Wisden called the match one of " most dramatic Test matches for many years " and labelled the disorder " unfortunate " and " remarkable " , remarking that the situation " became so bad that a riot developed . " Officials of the ground and the West Indies team had to apologise to the MCC , as had the Governor of Trinidad , Eric Williams and Learie Constantine . The match resumed and England went on to victory , and took the series 1 : 0 . India returned to the West Indies 1961 and played two further Tests at the Oval . 
 The Beaumont Cup competition was held at the Queen 's Park Oval from 1958 onwards , and from 1964 the Regional Four Day Competition also began , with the ground hosting Trinidad home games for both competitions . Australia returned to the ground in 1965 for the Second and Fifth Tests of the tour . The latter saw a heavy West Indian defeat . However , across the series they were victorious 2 – 1 in what Wisden called the " series for the unofficial championship of the world . " The West Indian first @-@ class domestic tournament , now renamed the Shell Shield , continued at the ground in the winter of 1965 . England under Colin Cowdrey returned in January 1968 – and during this match at the Queen 's Park Oval a generous declaration by Gary Sobers allowed England to win and level the series — followed by India in 1971 . On this tour India were victorious , the first time they had ever been so against the West Indies in the Caribbean . The score of 220 made by Indian Sunil Gavaskar at the Queen 's Park Oval during the Test match there remains the highest score made by any player at the ground . Gavaskar would go on to make a total of five centuries at the ground , the most by any player . The bowling analysis of 9 / 95 by West Indian Jack <unk> was also made during the same tour and remains the best bowling analysis at the Queen 's Park Oval . New Zealand returned that winter , followed by an Australian tour over the winter of 1972 – 73 . 
 = = = West Indian ascendency = = = 
 The West Indian 's had begun to experience difficulties in the final years of the 1960s . The Indian defeat had come on the back of defeats away to Australia and England . Though they played well against Australia on the 1972 – 73 tour , they lost 2 : 1 . In the Fourth Test in Guyana they fell to a 10 @-@ wicket defeat after being dismissed for 109 in their second innings . The utilisation of aggressive fast bowlers such as Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson had inspired West Indian captain to bring into his team men of similar virtues . In the 1976 Indian tour of the West Indies , the Queen 's Park Oval hosted the Second and Third Tests . The West Indians played Andy Roberts and Michael Holding in both games , though India played well enough to draw the first and win the second of these fixtures . Their victory in the second involved a record 406 @-@ run fourth innings to chase the West Indies total down . 
 Meanwhile , in domestic cricket , the Beaumont Cup had been renamed the Texaco Cup , and both it and the Shell Shield continued to feature at the Queen 's Park Oval . The first one @-@ day cricket matches had begun in the West Indies , and the Queen 's Park Oval hosted its inaugural Gillette Cup match between Trinidad and Tobago and the Windward Islands in February 1976 . Several of these games would be hosted at the ground each season . 
 Pakistan toured the West Indies in 1977 , by which time the hosts were becoming a major force in world cricket . For the next decade the team would win 40 and lose only six Tests . The Second and Fourth Tests of the 1977 Pakistan tour were both at the Queen 's Park Oval , and the West Indians comfortable took the former thanks to 8 / 29 by pacer Colin Croft , supported by Roberts and Joel Garner . Further success came in 1978 when two Tests against Australia at the ground both saw heavy West Indian victories . The First Test of the series saw Australia routed for 90 in their first innings by Garner , Croft and Roberts and a defeat to the hosts by an innings and 106 runs . A six @-@ wicket @-@ haul by <unk> Holder in the Fourth Test of the series , also at the Queen 's Park Oval , ensured another West Indian victory . With World Series Cricket ( WSC ) commencing a West Indies tour in 1979 , the third " Supertest " was held at the Queen 's Park Oval . With centuries from Bruce Laird and Greg Chappell , the Australian WSC team secured victory . 
 In 1981 the Queen 's Park Oval hosted England and saw West Indian victory by an innings , followed by a draw against India in 1982 . The first One @-@ Day International at the ground took place between India and the West Indies in March 1983 , with the hosts taking a comfortable victory . Australia , New Zealand and England all visited the ground for Test and ODI games during 1985 and 1986 , faring poorly . The decade ended with tours by Pakistan and India , mixed with matches from the now entitled Red Stripe Cup , the new name for the West Indian domestic first @-@ class competition . 
 Following a return by Pakistan in 1992 , England toured the West Indies over the winter of 1993 – 94 . The teams met March 25 at the Queen 's Park Oval and England were reduced to 46 all @-@ out by Curtly Ambrose . It remains the lowest total made in a Test match at the ground , and with 66 wickets Ambrose remains the most successful bowler there . 
 = = = West Indian decline , 2007 World Cup = = = 
 By the late 1990s the West Indian team had begun to decline . It was defeated by Australia in a 1994 – 95 series , the Third Test of which was played at the Queen 's Park Oval , as were two of the ODI matches . The ground hosted two Tests of the 1997 – 98 tour by England , the second of which in February saw the West Indies defeated by England . The West Indian captain during the match , Brian Lara , went on to be the leading run scorer at the Queen 's Park Oval in ODI matches , as well as hold record for the highest score made there . The West Indies lost heavily again to Australia at the ground in 1999 , by a margin of 312 runs . This , the opening Test of the series , set the tone for a five @-@ nil whitewash of the host team by the visiting Australians . The retirement of Ambrose and Courtney Walsh in 2001 further hampered West Indian efforts , and they were defeated at the Queen 's Park Oval by South Africa in March , and India in August 2001 . They were likewise defeated in ODI matches at the ground by both sides . The West Indies dropped to eighth in the Test rankings , with another heavy loss at the Queen 's Park Oval against England in 2004 , amid complaints about the quality of the pitch from England players . The West Indies also suffered at the hands of South Africa during ODI matches played at the ground . 
 The West Indies were chosen as hosts for the 2007 Cricket World Cup , with the Queen 's Park Oval selected as one of the venues . Renovation work commenced immediately to prepare the ground for the matches . These , however , suffered drawbacks . Labour shortages hampered the efforts of the construction workers . Two new stands at the Queen 's Park Oval were constructed for the event . Initially the International Cricket Council expressed concerns that the ground would not be ready in time , with Development Director Don Lockerbie stating that " the ante had to be upped . " An earthquake in late February that measured 5 @.@ 1 on the Richter magnitude scale caused damaged to the fledgling stands . Work which had due to be completed by December 2006 dragged into the spring of the following year , with opening matches of the competition due to start in March . Nevertheless , the new pavilion was unveiled in time for the matches . The ground was celebrated as " the only venue in the West Indies , and one of four in the world to host more than 50 Test matches and 51 ODIs " during a ceremony to open the new stands . Once the tournament had gotten underway , several Group B matches were played at the Queen 's Park Oval between teams such as Bermuda , India , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka . These matches included a score of 413 / 5 by India against Bermuda on March 19 , which remains the highest total made in an ODI at the Queen 's Park Oval . None of the final stage games were played at the ground , with the Super Eight stages all being played at either the Providence Stadium or the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium .

 Following the end of the World Cup , the Queen 's Park Oval has had a sporadic allotment of international cricket . Since 2007 there has been five ( 5 ) test matches the most recent of which was in June 2014 against New Zealand . Test matches were not allocated to the ground for 2010 , 2011 , 2013 and 2015 , which prompted a reaction from Trinidad and Tobago Cricket Association President Azim <unk> , who stated that " we in T & T need to have Test matches here so that our young and developing players can get a taste of the best form of the game . " . In 2010 due to the arrest of Christopher " <unk> " Coke and subsequent social unrest and deteriorating security situation in Kingston , Jamaica the 1st South Africa / West Indies test match that was initially allotted to Sabina Park was relocated to Trinidad .

 In the years following the World Cup the Queen 's Park Oval has missed out on hosting ODIs in 2009 , 2012 , 2014 , 2015 and 2016 . The ground last hosted ODIs in July 2013 when four ( 4 ) matches including the final of an ODI tri @-@ series that included Sri Lanka and India was played there . In that period of time the ground did host its first Twenty20 International , against England as a one @-@ off match . The hosts defeated England comfortably thanks largely to a score of 59 from 46 balls by Ramnaresh Sarwan , which leaves him to date the highest scorer and most prolific run @-@ maker at the ground in T20 Internationals . The ground hosted another Twenty20 International against Zimbabwe in February 2010 and against India in 2011 . No Twenty20 Internationals has been played since . 
 = = = = Domestic Cricket = = = = 
 The ground hosts domestic First Class , List A and T20 matches , of the Trinidad and Tobago Red Force National Team . With the advent of a new title sponsor for the West Indies domestic 50 over competition , Trinidad and Tobago was chosen as the venue for all matches for a three @-@ year period from 2014 to 2016 and the ground has hosted these matches . 
 The formation of the Caribbean Premier League has given the QPO a new tenant - The Trinidad and Tobago Red Steel and the ground has hosted Red Steel league matches in each of the three seasons as well as the semifinals and finals of the 2013 and 2015 editions of the CPL . For the 2016 CPL season the QPO will host home matches for the <unk> Knight Riders who replaced the Red Steel in the tournament when the ownership changed . 
 = = Facilities and pitch = = 
 In preparation for the 2007 World Cup there were significant renovations that took place at the Oval with the provision of several new facilities and buildings , as well as upgrades to existing infrastructure . According to a CricInfo review of the new ground on the eve of the World Cup , it featured a " library and museum space on the ground floor , as well as a top class health , spa , gymnasium and restaurant facilities , and an entertainment centre with satellite TV and other comforts . " The ground has a crowd capacity of around 18 @,@ 000 and day / night cricket is supported by the presence of floodlights , hosted on 6 towers around the ground . 
 The structures at the Oval include the " Learie Constantine Stand " , known in particular for its jovial crowds , the Trini Posse Stand which is located perpendicular to the pitch , the Carib / KFC / RBC Stand , the Brian Lara Pavilion , the latter named for the West Indian batsman , the CL Duprey / Republic Bank stand , the Scotia Bank / BG Stand , the Jeffrey Stollmeyer Stand and the Gerry Gomez Media Centre , the last two of which has been named for former cricketers . There was a structure called the Dos Santos Stand which was demolished in 2012 due to health and safety considerations with it suffering structural decay and weakening steel . No replacement has been constructed , significantly reducing the existing capacity of the stadium . 
 The pitch has two ends , the Pavilion End and Media Centre End . The Media Centre End was renamed in 2011 to the Willie Rodriguez End in honour of the former Queen 's Park and Trinidad and Tobago player . <unk> turf was used in the early years however Mole crickets caused too much damage on the original pitch which was laid directly onto the natural soil , so soon after the ground was purchased a pitch of clay was laid over a wicket made of coir matting . A 1932 study into cricket pitches ruled that clay pitches lacking in calcium carbonate were ideal for cricket play . However , the Queen 's Park Oval clay surface was disproportionately suited to batting . A score of 681 / 8d in 1954 , and double @-@ centuries by Everton Weekes in consecutive series during that same year , prompted the laying of a turf wicket in 1955 in an attempt to balance batting and bowling . Five 20 @-@ metre @-@ wide and 26 @-@ metre @-@ long pitches were dug , each with a depth of one meter . 
 The work was supported by a second study in 1962 , made in Australia , which argued that such turf wickets were more likely to lead to balanced cricket games . Between the Oval 's inaugural Test and January 1954 , the overall batting average at the ground was 37 @.@ 03 , and it dropped to 28 @.@ 07 between the installation of the new pitch and the year 2000 . Even the new pitch was , however , according to a 1982 report , " well known of its peculiar playing characteristics . " It crumbled during matches , giving more help to spin bowlers . Australian Test bowler Ashley Mallett believed that the new pitch was certainly more helpful to spin bowling , while England captain Nasser Hussain was negative about batting on the pitch during the 2004 England tour in his biography Playing With Fire . In 2012 the pitch was described by the media during the Australian tour as " slightly damp , tacky appearance " after rain , and then " tinder @-@ dry . "
