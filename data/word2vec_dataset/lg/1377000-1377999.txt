 The battle continued during the morning ; however , by 12 : 00 the North Koreans finally withdrew , abandoning the bridge to the Australians . Meanwhile , Coad put two companies from the Argylls across the Taeryong River on tanks at the Pakchon ford , and they met only slight opposition . The Middlesex then passed through them , moving south @-@ west onto the main road in front of 3 RAR where they knocked out a North Korean tank which was blocking their advance . By nightfall they had linked up with the Australians , consolidating their positions and securing a safe crossing for the remainder of the brigade , including the wheeled vehicles which followed that evening . North Korean patrols attempted to harass the British and Australian outposts ; however , despite their perimeter being shelled it proved to be a relatively quiet night for the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade .

 To the Australians the fighting at Kujin became known as the " Battle of the Broken Bridge " , and resulted in them securing a bridgehead across the Taeryong River , allowing the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade to continue its advance towards the Yalu River . North Korean casualties included 100 killed and 350 captured , while the Australian losses , which included their first battle fatalities of the war in Korea , were eight killed and 22 wounded . The dead were subsequently interred in a Christian churchyard in Pakchon and were later moved to a cemetery in Pyongyang . Among those captured by the Australians was at least one Chinese soldier , and although the significance of this was not recognised at the time it was undoubtedly a sign of events that would later alter the course of the war . Indeed , during the last weeks of October the Chinese had moved 18 divisions of the People 's Volunteer Army across the Yalu River under the overall command of Marshal Peng Dehuai . Undetected by US and South Korean intelligence , the 13th Army Group crossed the border on 16 October and penetrated up to 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) into North Korea .

 Meanwhile , on 27 October the Middlesex continued the brigade 's advance , and was involved in a sharp fight in the hills west of the river near the village of <unk> @-@ ni , killing 35 North Koreans and capturing 80 prisoners , while American aircraft destroyed 10 North Korean T @-@ 34 tanks and two SU @-@ 76 self @-@ propelled guns . The following day the Argylls took over as the lead battalion . Intelligence indicated that the British and Australians were facing the North Korean 17th Tank Brigade , equipped with 20 tanks , and although the North Koreans had suffered heavy casualties during the previous fighting on the Taeryong River , Coad was now forced to adopt more cautious tactics as a result , advancing in shorter bounds and clearing high points en route . With the war considered all but over the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade continued to pursue the North Koreans towards Chongju over the next three days ; however , the advance increasingly encountered strong resistance from North Korean infantry dug @-@ in with tanks and self @-@ propelled guns in support as they approached the Yalu River on the Manchurian border . 
 3 RAR took over as lead battalion of the brigade on 29 October , 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) from Chongju . That morning a spotter aircraft reported a large North Korean formation consisting of a battalion @-@ sized force of 500 – 600 infantry supported by several tanks and at least two self @-@ propelled guns , positioned on a thickly wooded ridgeline around Chongju . The Battle of Chongju ensued as the Australians dislodged the strong North Korean armoured force and then defended their positions against North Korean counterattacks during the evening . The following day the Australians advanced to the high ground overlooking Chongju , killing and capturing a number of North Koreans in skirmishes . That afternoon the town itself was cleared by the remaining elements of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade without opposition . North Korean casualties during the fighting were heavy , while Australian losses included Green , who was wounded in the stomach by artillery fire after the battle and succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on 1 November . 
 = A4 ( Croatia ) = 
 The A4 motorway ( Croatian : Autocesta A4 ) is a motorway in Croatia spanning 97 @.@ 0 kilometres ( 60 @.@ 3 mi ) . It connects the nation 's capital , Zagreb , to the city of Varaždin and to Budapest , Hungary via the Goričan border crossing . The motorway represents a major north – south transportation corridor in Croatia and is a part of European routes E65 and E71 . The A4 motorway route also follows Pan @-@ European corridor Vb . 
 Apart from Zagreb and Varaždin , the A4 motorway runs near a number of Croatian cities , and connects to the rest of the Croatian motorway network east of Zagreb . The motorway route was completed in 2008 . The motorway 's national significance is reflected in the positive economic impact on the cities and towns it connects , as well as its importance to tourism in Croatia . The genuine importance of the motorway as a transit route will be demonstrated upon completion of proposed expansion of Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node , since the A4 represents an integral part of the Rijeka – Zagreb – Budapest transport route . 
 As the route traverses hilly terrain , it requires a substantial number of viaducts and tunnels , as well as two major bridges to span the Drava and Mura rivers . The motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction separated by a central reservation . There are no emergency lanes in the tunnels . All intersections of the A4 motorway are grade separated . As of October 2010 , there are 12 exits and 3 rest areas operating along the route . As the motorway is tolled using a ticket system , each exit includes a toll plaza . Exits south of the Sveta Helena mainline toll plaza have no toll plazas , as that part of the A4 route is not tolled . The same applies to the northernmost section between the Goričan exit and the Hungarian border . 
 A motorway connecting Zagreb to Varaždin and Budapest was proposed in the early 1970s , but unlike the Zagreb – Rijeka or Zagreb – Belgrade motorways , no construction was actually carried out . The first section of the road , later designated as the A4 motorway , was developed as a 6 @-@ kilometre ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) two @-@ lane road to serve as an interchange ramp in Ivanja Reka . The majority of the entire motorway was built between 1997 and 2003 , leaving only a 1 @.@ 6 @-@ kilometre ( 0 @.@ 99 mi ) section between the Goričan interchange and the Goričan – <unk> border crossing left to build . The section was fully completed on October 22 , 2008 . In 1998 , construction costs were estimated at 850 million German marks ( € 434 @.@ 5 million ) . Although a 32 @-@ year concession for development of the motorway was awarded to <unk> Autocesta d.d. ( TEA ) in 1997 , Hrvatske autoceste took over development , maintenance and management of the route in 2000 when the concession was cancelled , leading to a dispute with Astaldi , the majority owner of TEA . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The A4 motorway is a significant north – south motorway in the northern Croatia connecting the nation 's capital , Zagreb , to the Hungarian M7 motorway at the Goričan border crossing . The southern terminus of the A4 motorway at the interchange in Ivanja Reka represents its junction with the rest of the Croatian motorway network via the A3 motorway . As a part of the road network of Croatia , the motorway is a part of European route E65 and European route E71 . The motorway is of major importance to Croatia in terms of the development of its economy , notably tourism , as it represents the shortest and the most comfortable route between Budapest , Hungary and the Adriatic Sea . This particularly applies to tourist resorts on the Istria and Kvarner Gulf islands and to the Port of Rijeka , but it is also true for resorts in the Dalmatia region , served via the A1 motorway . The genuine importance of the motorway as a transit route will be demonstrated upon completion of the proposed expansion of the Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node . This expansion is planned to encompass the growth of the Port of Rijeka 's cargo handling capacity , improved railroad links and a new Rijeka bypass motorway linking the A6 , via a new interchange , to the present routes of the A7 and A8 motorways . The project is , among other goals , aimed to increase traffic along the Croatian part of Pan @-@ European corridor Vb , of which the A4 motorway is a part . 
 The motorway spans 97 @.@ 0 kilometres ( 60 @.@ 3 mi ) between the Goričan border crossing to Hungary and Zagreb – Ivanja Reka interchange on the A3 motorway . Among other cities and towns , it connects to Čakovec via the D20 , Ludbreg and Koprivnica via the <unk> and D2 , Varaždin via the <unk> , Novi Marof via the <unk> , <unk> via the D10 state roads and Dugo Selo via the <unk> county road . Future development of the motorway will include additional rest areas and a possible expansion of interchanges . The A4 motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction along its entire length , except in tunnels where there are emergency bays instead . All existing interchanges are trumpet interchanges , except in Ivanja Reka , which is a modified cloverleaf . There is a number of rest areas along the motorway , providing various types of services ranging from parking spaces and restrooms to filling stations and restaurants . As of October 2010 , the motorway has 12 interchanges , providing access to numerous towns and cities and the Croatian state road network . The A4 motorway is concurrent with the D3 state road between the Komin and Ivanja Reka interchanges , although the D3 is not signposted along that section . The motorway is operated by Hrvatske autoceste . 
 An automatic traffic monitoring and guidance system is in place along the motorway . It consists of measuring , control and signaling devices , located in zones where driving conditions may vary — at interchanges , near viaducts , bridges , tunnels and in zones where fog and strong winds are known to occur . The system consists of variable traffic signs used to communicate changing driving conditions , possible restrictions and other information to motorway users . 
 The A4 motorway runs through hills and plains crossed by a number of watercourses , requiring a number of bridges , viaducts and tunnels along the route . Particular attention to the environment is also required , due to the several water supply and natural heritage zones . 
 = = Toll = = 
 The A4 is a tolled motorway based on the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system . As of October 2010 , toll charged along the A4 route between the Sveta Helena and Goričan mainline toll plazas varies depending on the length of route travelled and ranges from 7 @.@ 00 kuna ( € 0 @.@ 96 ) to 36 @.@ 00 kuna ( € 4 @.@ 93 ) for passenger cars and 22 @.@ 00 kuna ( € 3 @.@ 01 ) to 120 @.@ 00 kuna ( € 16 @.@ 44 ) for semi @-@ trailer trucks . The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards , debit cards and a number of prepaid toll collection systems . The latter includes various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC , an electronic toll collection ( ETC ) system which is shared at most motorways in Croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas . The northernmost section of the motorway , between the border and Goričan interchange ( inclusive ) is not tolled . Similarly , the southernmost part of the A4 motorway route , located between Sveta Helena and Ivanja Reka interchanges ( inclusive ) is also toll @-@ free , as it is a part of the Zagreb bypass , which services a significant volume of traffic . 
 = = Notable structures = = 
 The A4 motorway Varaždin – Breznički Hum section route runs through hilly landscape requiring a number of viaducts and tunnels , especially along the Breznički Hum – Novi Marof section and around the <unk> <unk> exit . Each comprises four traffic lanes , while the viaducts have emergency lanes . Two most notable structures are the <unk> and <unk> tunnels , located to the south and north of the exit , respectively . Both of the tunnels consist of two tubes each , and each of them carry two traffic lanes . The <unk> Tunnel tubes are unequal in length , as the southbound tube is 498 metres ( 1 @,@ 634 ft ) long , while the northbound tube is 523 metres ( 1 @,@ 716 ft ) long . The <unk> Tunnel southbound tube is 628 metres ( 2 @,@ 060 ft ) long and its northbound tube is 522 metres ( 1 @,@ 713 ft ) long , earning the distinction of being the longest tunnel on the A4 route . There are two major bridges on the A4 motorway , both of them located north of Varaždin . The longest one is the Drava Bridge , carrying the motorway across the Drava River , measuring 507 @.@ 7 metres ( 1 @,@ 666 ft ) long . There is also the Zrinski Bridge , carrying the A4 motorway across Mur River and across the Croatia – Hungary border , thus representing the northern terminus of the motorway , where northbound A4 traffic defaults to the Hungarian M7 motorway towards Nagykanizsa and Budapest . The 216 @-@ metre ( 709 ft ) Zrinski Bridge was the final structure completed on the route . Both the Drava and Mura bridges carry six motorway lanes . 
 = = History = = 
 A motorway connecting Zagreb to Varaždin and Budapest was proposed in the early 1970s , but unlike the Zagreb – Rijeka and Zagreb – Belgrade motorways , no construction was carried out . Although the first section of the route , now designated as the A4 motorway , was completed in 1980 , development for the motorway was proposed once again in 1991 to facilitate links between the Varaždin area , Zagreb and the remainder of the Croatian motorway network . The route was added to the network of Pan @-@ European transport corridors in June 1997 , during the third Pan @-@ European Transport Conference in Helsinki , and on August 7 , 1997 , the government of the Republic of Croatia decided to establish the Autocesta Rijeka – Zagreb – Goričan company and award it a 28 @-@ year concession to develop , operate and maintain the route as a six @-@ lane motorway . The route consisted of the entire Croatian section of the Pan @-@ European corridor Vb except for 20 @.@ 8 @-@ kilometre ( 12 @.@ 9 mi ) of the Lučko – Ivanja Reka section of the A3 motorway , which was already in use as a part of Zagreb bypass . 
 Later that same year , on May 14 , 1998 , the government signed an agreement with Astaldi , regulating construction of the Zagreb Goričan motorway by 2000 . On December 11 , 1997 , pursuant to the agreement , the government established the Autocesta Rijeka – Zagreb company to take the place of the Autocesta Rijeka – Zagreb – Goričan company , and awarded it the 28 @-@ year concession to develop , maintain and operate the Zagreb – Rijeka motorway , effectively excluding the Zagreb – Goričan motorway from the original concession . At the same time , the <unk> <unk> d.o.o. ( TEA ) company was established by the government and awarded concession for development , operation and maintenance of the Zagreb – Goričan motorway . Astaldi owned 51 % of TEA , with the remainder owned by the Republic of Croatia . TEA was to secure financing of the project in 1998 . Construction began as scheduled ; however , financial and legal problems ensued , and by 1999 , the press speculated that Astaldi had given up the project , but Astaldi repeatedly denied these claims . Ultimately , the government cancelled the contract and ceded the motorway to Croatian Roads Administration ( ancestor of Hrvatske autoceste and Hrvatske ceste ) , leading Astaldi to turn to the commercial arbitration court in Vienna , which ruled in its favour . The Republic of Croatia was subsequently required to pay Astaldi 44 @.@ 3 million euro in damages . 
 In 1980 , the 6 @-@ kilometre ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) Popovec – Ivanja Reka section was the first part of the A4 motorway to be built , as a semi @-@ motorway , for the new Ivanja Reka interchange on the motorway , later designated A3 . The first section completed was the 16 @-@ kilometre ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) Goričan – Čakovec section , opened to traffic in 1997 , followed by the 22 @.@ 4 @-@ kilometre ( 13 @.@ 9 mi ) Komin – Popovec and the 15 @.@ 58 @-@ kilometre ( 9 @.@ 68 mi ) Čakovec – Varaždin sections , completed in 1998 . In 2000 , the 12 @.@ 3 @-@ kilometre ( 7 @.@ 6 mi ) Breznički Hum – Komin section was finished , and in 2003 , the motorway route was nearly completed as the 23 @.@ 25 @-@ kilometre ( 14 @.@ 45 mi ) Varaždin – Breznički Hum section and the second carriageway in the Popovec – Ivanja Reka section were built . The final 1 @.@ 6 @-@ kilometre ( 0 @.@ 99 mi ) section between the Goričan exit and the Hungarian border opened on October 22 , 2008 , the same day the final section of the A6 motorway was finalised , marking completion of the Budapest – Zagreb – Rijeka motorway . 
 = = Traffic volume = = 
 Traffic is regularly counted and reported by Hrvatske autoceste , operator of the motorway , and results are published by Hrvatske ceste . The largest annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) volume is often recorded in the Sveta Helena – Komin section , although all sections between Sveta Helena and Varaždin display similar AADT . AADT data for sections north of Varaždin show considerable drops in traffic volume . As the motorway traffic volume is measured through analysis of toll ticket sales , the southernmost section of the motorway , Ivanja Reka – Sveta Helena , is not included in the report . However , since the section is a part of the Zagreb bypass , it carries significantly heavier traffic than any other sections of the A4 motorway — in 2004 , traffic volume along the toll @-@ free section of the A4 motorway was approximately 24 @,@ 000 vehicles per day ( AADT ) between the <unk> <unk> and Sveta Helena interchanges and nearly 41 @,@ 000 vehicles per day between the <unk> <unk> and Ivanja Reka interchanges . Traffic volume measured on the Ivanja Reka – Ivanić Grad section of the A3 motorway increased by 30 % , hinting at a similar increase in traffic volume on the A4 route south of Sveta Helena . 
 Variations between AADT and average summer daily traffic ( ASDT ) traffic volumes are attributed to the fact that the motorway carries substantial tourist traffic to the Adriatic Sea resorts . 
 = = Rest areas = = 
 As of October 2010 , there are three rest areas along the A4 motorway . Legislation identifies four types of rest areas designated as types A through D : A @-@ type rest areas comprise a full range of amenities , including a filling station , a restaurant and a hotel or motel ; B @-@ type rest areas have no lodging ; C @-@ type rest areas are very common and include a filling station and a café , but no restaurants or accommodations ; D @-@ type rest areas only offer parking spaces , possibly picnicking tables and benches , and restrooms . Even though rest areas found along the A4 motorway generally follow this ranking system , there are considerable variations , as some of them offer extra services . The filling stations regularly have small convenience stores , and some of them may offer LPG fuel . 
 The primary motorway operator , Hrvatske autoceste ( HAC ) , leases the A , B and C type rest areas to various operators through public tenders . As of October 2010 , there are two such rest area operators on the A4 motorway : INA and <unk> . The rest area operators are not permitted to sub @-@ lease the fuel operations . The A4 motorway rest areas are accessible from both directions of the motorway and operate 24 hours a day , 7 days a week .

Mike Jackson left the Michigan basketball program to join rival Purdue and was replaced by LaVall Jordan , who previously served as an assistant coach for Iowa . 
 The team lost its four tallest contributors from the prior season : DeShawn Sims , Zack Gibson , Anthony Wright and Manny Harris . The same weekend that Harris declared for the 2010 NBA Draft in late March , the team accepted a commitment from Jon Horford . Horford , who was named a 2010 Class A All @-@ State performer from the Associated Press , the Detroit Free Press and the Detroit News , is the younger brother of Atlanta Hawk Al Horford and son of former NBA player Tito Horford . Horford did not actually sign his letter of intent until the opening of the spring signing period on April 14 . After Horford 's signing , the Wolverines had two scholarships available . The 2010 class included Tim Hardaway , Jr . , son of Tim Hardaway . With the signings and loss of Ben Cronin to injury , the 2010 – 11 team 's front court was composed of incoming freshmen Evan Smotrycz and Horford along with redshirt freshmen Blake McLimans and Jordan Morgan . 
 Jordan Dumars ( son of Joe Dumars ) transferred to the University of Michigan in January 2010 after playing in six games for the South Florida Bulls men 's basketball team .

 = Tropical Storm Alice ( 1953 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Alice was the first tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean to receive a female name . It was a rare off @-@ season tropical cyclone that hit Central America , Cuba , and Florida in late May to early June 1953 . Alice formed on May 25 in the western Caribbean , and executed a large loop over Central America . It passed over western Cuba , causing heavy rainfall and possibly several casualties from drowning . It then executed another loop in the Gulf of Mexico , reached a peak intensity of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) , and weakened before hitting the Florida panhandle on June 6 . Although heavy rainfall occurred in Florida , there was little damage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In May and June 1953 , an unusually long @-@ lasting upper @-@ level low persisted across Mexico and Central America . On May 25 , a weak warm @-@ core surface circulation developed east of Nicaragua . It moved around the upper @-@ level low , bringing it to the northwest and later looping to the south through Honduras and Central America . The system weakened over land , but it re @-@ intensified over the western Caribbean Sea , moving over western Cuba as a 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) tropical storm on May 31 . Advisories for Alice did not begin until June 1 , when the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico . 
 Around the time the cyclone 's naming , reconnaissance aircraft reported winds of around 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) , and subsequently Alice executed another loop off the northwest coast of Cuba . Alice weakened quickly to minimal tropical storm status , due to interaction with a cold front off Florida . It deteriorated so much that advisories were discontinued , with Miami Weather Bureau meteorologist James George remarking that " no danger [ existed there ] whatsoever . " After again passing near the Cuban coast , Alice turned to the northwest and began re @-@ strengthening . On June 5 , reconnaissance aircraft estimated 70 to 75 mph ( 110 to 120 km / h ) winds in brief squalls northeast of the center , along with a pressure of 997 hectopascals ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) ; this would be its peak intensity . The storm again weakened as it approached the Florida peninsula , and Alice made landfall just west of Panama City Beach on June 6 as a minimal tropical storm . It dissipated shortly thereafter . 
 = = Impact and records = = 
 While the storm was in the vicinity of western Cuba , it produced heavy rainfall , which broke a nine @-@ month drought . The rainfall caused flooding , and there were unconfirmed reports of several deaths due to drowning . 
 When advisories first began on the storm , the National Hurricane Center issued storm warnings from Key West through Tarpon Springs on the west coast of Florida ; at the same time , the agency posted small craft warnings for the east coast up through Palm Beach . Alice brought heavy rainfall to Florida , peaking at 13 @.@ 48 inches ( 342 mm ) in Lake Placid in the central portion of the state . The rains ended a dry spell in the state . Along the Florida panhandle , workers tied down planes in local Air Force and Naval bases . No evacuations were ordered , and the primary impact was in the form of light rain . There were no reports of damage in the state . 
 From 1950 to 1952 , Atlantic hurricanes were named using the Joint Army / Navy Phonetic Alphabet . Before the 1953 season , officials changed the system to using female names ; hence , Alice was the first in the new format . Male names would not be used until 1979 . The name " Alice " was later reused twice in 1954 for a hurricane in June and December , as well as for a hurricane in 1973 . 
 = National Airlines Flight 2511 = 
 National Airlines Flight 2511 was a domestic passenger flight from New York City , New York to Miami , Florida that exploded in midair on January 6 , 1960 . The National Airlines Douglas DC @-@ 6 was carrying five crew and 29 passengers , all of whom perished . The Civil Aeronautics Board investigation concluded that the plane was brought down by a dynamite bomb . No criminal charges were ever filed , nor was the blame for the bombing ever determined , though a suicide bombing is suspected . The investigation remains open today . 
 One of the victims was retired US Navy Vice Admiral Edward Orrick McDonnell , a Medal of Honor recipient and veteran of both World Wars . 
 = = Flight history = = 
 National Airlines ' New York @-@ Miami route was usually flown by a Boeing 707 as Flight 601 . On January 5 , 1960 , the 707 aircraft scheduled to fly to Miami was grounded due to cracks that were discovered in the cockpit windshield . The windshield replacement procedure would take eight hours to perform , so National Airlines transferred the passengers of Flight 601 to two propliner aircraft it had in reserve . 
 Passengers were boarded on the two replacement planes on a first @-@ come , first @-@ served basis . 76 passengers boarded a Lockheed L @-@ 188 Electra . This aircraft flew to Miami and arrived safely . 
 The remaining 29 passengers boarded a Douglas DC @-@ 6B , which departed Idlewild Airport for Miami as Flight 2511 . They were accompanied by two stewardesses , pilot Dale Southard , copilot R.L. <unk> , and flight engineer R.R. <unk> . The plane departed New York at 11 : 52 p.m. and was scheduled to arrive in Miami at 4 : 36 a.m. on January 6 . 
 The aircraft , registration <unk> , was described as being in good condition . It had four Pratt and Whitney R @-@ 2800 CB @-@ 16 engines and had accumulated 24 @,@ 836 hours of flight time prior to this flight . 
 Flight 2511 's flight plan called for it to fly south from New York to Wilmington , North Carolina , where it would veer east over the Atlantic Ocean . From there it would fly south 550 miles ( 890 km ) over the ocean to Palm Beach , Florida . The crew maintained radio contact with National Airlines ' radio controllers and air traffic control , reporting clouds and instrument flying conditions . The crew checked in with Wilmington Airport at 2 : 07 a.m. , and later reported flying over the Carolina Beach radio beacon at 2 : 31 . This was the last radio contact with the airplane . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After losing contact with the DC @-@ 6 aircraft , National Airlines , the US Coast Guard , and the US Navy began an intensive search along the southeastern coast of the United States . The search was called off the following day , when National Airlines received word that there was a plane down in North Carolina . 
 At about 2 : 45 a.m. , a farmer by the name of Richard Randolph heard the sound of an engine cutting in and out , followed by tearing metal and an explosion . Later that morning , after finding airplane wreckage in one of his fields , he drove to Bolivia , North Carolina , which had the nearest phone . He called Wilmington Airport to report the downed plane at approximately 7 : 00 a.m. When Highway Patrol officers responded , he led them to the crash site . 
 Bodies and wreckage were scattered over an area of 20 acres ( 0 @.@ 081 km2 ) covering farm fields , marshland , and pine forests . 
 During the first day of search and rescue , investigators were able to locate 32 bodies of the 34 persons on board . One of the missing bodies was later found at the main crash site . The remaining body was found at Snow 's Marsh , approximately 16 miles ( 26 km ) from the main site . 
 Initial reports speculated that the aircraft had disintegrated in mid @-@ flight . One newspaper reporter indicated that the largest piece of wreckage he observed was a portion of the wing . A piece of aluminum , believed to be a piece of the airplane 's skin , was found on Kure Beach , 25 miles ( 40 km ) from the rest of the wreckage . 
 = = Investigations = = 
 The Civil Aeronautics Board ( CAB ) , part of the Department of Transportation , were the primary investigators into the crash of Flight 2511 . The wreckage of the DC @-@ 6 was taken to a hangar at nearby Wilmington Airport , where the fuselage was reassembled on a wood @-@ and @-@ chicken @-@ wire frame . Investigators were able to recover approximately 90 % of the fuselage , which was then assembled on the frame in the Wilmington hangar . 
 Investigators were able to identify the point of origin of the disintegration as an area immediately ahead of the leading edge of the aircraft 's right wing . The material recovered from Kure Beach , including a portion of the wing fillet , was from this general area . Investigators were unable to recover material from an irregular , triangularly shaped area positioned above the leading edge and extending forward ahead of the wing . 
 The bodies were brought to the local high school gymnasium to await autopsy and identification by an FBI fingerprinting team . The Brunswick County coroner ordered autopsies of the passengers and crew to determine the cause of death of each . Twenty @-@ nine passengers and five crew perished aboard Flight 2511 . One of the victims was Vice Admiral Edward Orrick McDonnell , U. S. Navy ( retired ) , a recipient of the Medal of Honor and a veteran of both World Wars . Other victims included a vice president of the Continental Bank of Cuba , a pharmacist , a student at the University of Miami , and an insurance adjuster . Three of the victims had been standby passengers and only made the flight due to others cancelling their reservations . 
 = = = Julian Frank = = = 
 The only body not found at the main crash site was that of Julian Frank , a New York lawyer . His body was recovered from Snow 's Marsh , located on the west side of the Cape Fear River . Frank 's body had sustained significant injuries , including the amputation of both legs , and debris was embedded in his body . Frank 's injuries were significantly different from and much more extensive than the other passengers ' . Furthermore , Frank 's injuries were inconsistent with the type of injury usually incurred in an aircraft accident . 
 Frank was autopsied twice , the second time to recover debris embedded in his body . The autopsy revealed that : his lower extremities had been ripped off ; his muscle tissue was extensively mutilated and torn ; small pieces of wire , brass , and miscellaneous articles including a hat ornament were imbedded in various limbs ; the fingers of his right hand were fractured and the bones splintered ; and the distal phalanx of each finger on his left hand were missing . The coroner also observed numerous patches of blackened areas , similar to close @-@ range gunshot residue . Four human finger bones were discovered among the wreckage at the primary crash site . 
 At the time of the crash , Frank had been accused of running a charity scam and was under investigation by the Manhattan district attorney 's office . It was alleged that he had misappropriated up to a million dollars in a series of scams . 
 = = = Bombing = = = 
 The crash of National Airlines Flight 2511 came shortly after the crash of another National Airlines plane . National Airlines Flight 967 exploded over the Gulf of Mexico on November 16 , 1959 . The cause of the explosion was believed to be a bomb in the luggage of one of the passengers , Dr. Robert Spears , who enlisted a substitute to board the plane in his place . Spears was heavily insured , and the FBI indicated that his motive was insurance fraud . Similarly , Julian Frank was covered by almost $ 900 @,@ 000 in life insurance policies , including some purchased the day of the crash . 
 The CAB sent the material recovered from Frank 's body to the FBI laboratories for testing and analysis . Analysis determined that the many wire fragments that were found embedded in Frank 's body , in the seats on the right @-@ hand side , and in the carpeting , were low @-@ carbon steel wire , 0 @.@ 025 inches ( 0 @.@ 64 mm ) in diameter . One of the dismembered fingers recovered from the wreckage had embedded in it the face plate of a travel alarm clock . A life jacket from Kure Beach , found with parts of a flight bag embedded in it , tested positive for nitrate residue . A black " crusty " residue on Frank 's right hand was found to be manganese dioxide , a substance found in dry cell batteries . 
 In addition to the evidence collected from Frank 's body , there were also samples of residue taken from the air vents and hat rack located on the right side of the aircraft near the leading edge of the wing . These samples contained sodium carbonate , sodium nitrate , and mixtures of sodium @-@ sulfur compounds . 
 The Civil Aeronautics Board concluded that the severity of Frank 's injuries and the numerous particulates found embedded in his body could only be attributed to his proximity to an explosion . Furthermore , the chemical compounds detected in the area around the explosion 's point of origin were consistent with those generated by a dynamite explosion . The manganese dioxide samples collected from the seats near the focal point and from Frank 's body indicated that a dry cell battery was located very near to the explosive . The CAB determined that , based on the blast pattern , a dynamite charge had been placed underneath the window seat of row 7 . 
 The CAB 's chief investigator , Oscar Bakke , testified before the Senate Aviation subcommittee to this effect on January 12 , 1960 . The same day , the FBI formally took over the criminal aspects of the investigation . 
 = = = Other theories = = = 
 One of the first theories considered by investigators was that Flight 2511 was involved in a collision with another airliner , given the crash site 's proximity to Wilmington Airport . Investigators reviewed the flight plan and other documents to determine if other aircraft were in the area . There was no record of any other aircraft , or of any military missiles having been fired . Furthermore , wreckage of Flight 2511 was confined to two general locations : the primary crash scene near Bolivia and the secondary scene in Kure Beach . All debris was accounted for as belonging to the DC @-@ 6 . 
 Another theory presented by an expert shortly after the crash theorized that an engine fire could have been the catalyst of the accident . Under this theory , one of the two engines on the right wing may have caught fire . Shrapnel from the engine may have punctured the fuselage , causing explosive decompression . Alternatively , Julian Frank , who was known to be desperately afraid of flying , may have panicked and hit the window , weakening it such that it subsequently blew out . Under this theory , the pilots and passengers would have been aware of an emergency aboard , which would have allowed them to begin making preparations for an emergency landing . This theory was supported by the wide right turn that the aircraft appeared to make prior to disintegrating and crashing , as well as the fact that some of the passengers were found wearing life jackets . 
 Though the bombing and engine fire theories were the most commonly held , other theories were advanced during the investigation as well . Several days after the explosion , National Airlines pilots who were members of the Airline Pilots Association sent a telegram to the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) . In the telegram , they made the claim that the routine proficiency flights performed by pilots caused unnecessary stress on the aircraft . These test flights , which pilots underwent every six months , required the pilots to put their aircraft through " violent maneuvers " which could damage the aircraft . 
 In their final report , the Civil Aeronautics Board indicated that it had investigated a variety of alternative theories , including : 
 metal fatigue failure of the cabin leading to explosive decompression 
 a propeller blade failing , striking , and rupturing the cabin 
 a malfunction in the cabin pressurization system leading to structural failure 
 a foreign object striking the plane and penetrating the cabin 
 lightning strike 
 fuel vapor explosion 
 oxygen bottle explosion 
 The CAB was , however , able to rule out each of these theories during the course of their investigation . 
 = = = Conclusions = = = 
 The Civil Aeronautics Board concluded that Flight 2511 was brought down by a dynamite explosion in the passenger cabin . The explosive charge was located " beneath the extreme right seat of seat row No. 7 . " The report also pointed out that Julian Frank was close to the explosion , though it assigned no blame to him . 
 The explosion occurred at approximately 2 : 33 a.m. , significantly damaging the structural integrity of the aircraft and forcing it into a wide , right @-@ hand turn . As it descended , it suffered an in @-@ flight disintegration and crashed at 2 : 38 a.m. 
 The CAB concluded in their final report : 
 The FBI assumed control of the criminal investigation on January 20 , 1960 . The case remains open and unsolved .

 = Værøy Airport = 
 Værøy Airport ( Norwegian : Værøy lufthavn ; IATA : <unk> , ICAO : <unk> ) was a regional airport located at Nordlandet on the island and municipality of Værøy , Norway . Operated between 1986 and 1990 , it had an 800 @-@ by @-@ 30 @-@ meter ( 2 @,@ 625 by 98 ft ) asphalt runway aligned 07 – 25 . The airport was owned and operated by the Municipality of Værøy . It was served by Widerøe , who operated de Havilland Canada DHC @-@ 6 Twin Otter aircraft to Bodø and Røst . 
 Widerøe commenced seaplane operates to Værøy from 1965 ; five years later the first helicopter services were introduced . Planning of an airport started in the late 1960s , but unfavorable weather conditions prolonged finding a suitable location . The decision to build the airport was taken in 1984 , construction began the following year and the airport opened on 1 June 1986 . The fatal Widerøe Flight 839 accident took place on 12 April 1990 , in which heavy wind caused structural failure of a Twin Otter . The airport has been closed since ; helicopter services commenced in 1993 and Værøy Heliport opened in 1997 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early aviation = = = 
 The first aircraft to land in Værøy was a Noorduyn Norseman of the Royal Norwegian Air Force in 1948 . Services to Værøy started in 1965 , when Widerøe commenced sea plane services to the island using de Havilland Canada DHC @-@ 3 Otters and Norseman aircraft . The routes were operated two to three times per week as a charter service , with subsidies from the municipalities of Værøy and Røst . At Værøy the airline parked the aircraft in <unk> and rowed passengers to and from land with a rowboat . Ragnar Johansen 's Cessna was a frequent operator to Værøy for charter services . 
 Helikopter Service flew between Bodø Airport to Værøy and Røst — the island community further out from Værøy — with three weekly services from 1973 . The helicopters doubled as serving for search and rescue duty ; in case they were needed for the latter flights to Værøy and Røst were cancelled . The regional airports in Lofoten and Vesterålen opened in 1972 , with the Værøy and Røst service being taken over by Widerøe on 1 September 1973 . As they did not want to operate helicopters , they subcontracted the operations to Helilift . The service operated twice per day on weekdays and once per day in the weekends , using two sixteen @-@ seat Sikorsky S @-@ 58Ts . Subsidies of 1 @.@ 9 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) was granted for the route in 1973 , and the service transported 5 @,@ 359 passengers ( from both Røst and Værøy ) . At Værøy the helicopters landed at Hanna Bakken @-@ <unk> in Sørland . 
 One of the helicopters was bought by Widerøe in December 1976 and the operations were subcontracted to Offshore Helicopters . The second Sikorsky was bought from Helilift in March 1978 and also operated by Offshore Helicopters . Helikopter Service merged with Offshore Helicopters in 1980 , and the new Helikopter Service took over the route . They introduced an eleven @-@ seat Bell 212 helicopters from 1 January 1982 because of the high maintenance costs of the S @-@ 58Ts . In 1982 the service to both islands handled 7 @,@ 145 passengers and three tonnes of post and cargo , and made 744 landings . It received subsidies for NOK 4 million . 
 = = = Establishment = = = 
 The first proposals for an airport on Værøy were launched by the government in the late 1960s . A 1968 meteorological report concluded that the island was highly susceptible for strong winds , dominantly from the west , which could cause problems for air traffic . Three locations were considered : <unk> , <unk> og Nordlandet . The Norwegian Meteorological Institute concluded in 1973 that Nordlandet was the most suitable location in terms of weather , but test flights showed otherwise . Nordlandet was the cheapest alternative . Estimates showed that the regularity at an airport would be significantly lower than at the existing heliport . This caused local politicians to wish to keep the existing service , but pressure from Røst caused Værøy politicians to support an airport . After initial protests against Nordlandet as a site , Mayor Asmund Berg accepted the location on 3 May 1984 . There had not been conducted sufficient test flights to establish the wind conditions above the airport caused by <unk> , a mountain next to the airport . Widerøe was opposed to the location of the airport . 
 Planning of the airport ran parallel with five other regional airports : Fagernes Airport , Leirin ; Førde Airport , Bringeland ; Mosjøen Airport , Kjærstad ; Rørvik Airport , Ryum and Røst Airport . Construction was approved by the Parliament of Norway on 10 April 1984 and construction began in 1985 . The municipality was granted concession to operate the airport on 22 August 1985 . Værøy and Røst Airports were opened on 1 June 1986 , after NOK 15 million had been spent on constructing Værøy Airport . 
 = = = Operative history = = = 
 Værøy Airport was plagued with bad wind conditions and low regularity . The airport had the highest number of cancellations in the country , with 31 of 609 flights canceled in the first eleven months of operation . During some periods , regularity was as low as 50 % . The navigational aids were moved in 1989 to increase safety , more runway lights were installed and an anemometer was installed on the mountain , costing NOK 1 million . Widerøe introduced self @-@ imposed restrictions on landing at Værøy from 31 October 1988 . Aircraft were not allowed to land or take off if the wind came from 090 ° – 240 ° ( though south ) if the wind speed exceeded 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) , including gusts . Additional restriction were introduced following an incident on 18 January 1989 . These were again modified on 1 November 1989 . 
 On 12 April 1990 , Widerøe Flight 839 crashed one minute after take @-@ off , killing all five on board . The cause of the accident was the turbulence and high wind speeds around the airport . The airport was immediately closed after the incident ; no public flights have taken off from the Airport after Flight 839 . Private flights still use the airport on occasion . The Ministry of Transport and Communications decided on 17 January 1992 to permanently close the airport , after it had been temporarily closed since the accident . This made Værøy Airport the civilian airport in Europe to have operated the shortest time . Helikopter Service resumed helicopter flights from Hanna Bakken @-@ <unk> on 1 January 1993 . Construction of a new heliport started in 1996 and Værøy Heliport opened on 15 February 1997 .

 Dorothy " Dot " Branning ( also Cotton ) is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera , EastEnders , played by June Brown since 1985 . Dot first appeared in EastEnders in July 1985 as the mother of criminal Nick Cotton ( John Altman ) . The character has worked as a launderette assistant for most of that time along with original character Pauline Fowler ( Wendy Richard ) . Dot moved away with her son and his family in 1993 . In reality , Brown left the show in 1993 , unhappy with the axing of her co star Peter Dean , who played Pete Beale from the shows first episode to early 1993 . Brown returned to the role in 1997 , and Dot was shown moving back to Albert Square , and has continued since that time . Dot is the second longest @-@ serving character currently appearing in EastEnders , surpassed only by original character Ian Beale ( Adam Woodyatt ) . In a special episode entitled EastEnders : Dot 's Story ( 2003 ) a young Dot was played by Tallulah Pitt @-@ Brown in flashbacks . In April 2012 , Brown took a six @-@ month break from the show to write her memoirs . Dot temporarily departed on 18 May 2012 . She returned on 14 January 2013 . In February 2015 , Dot began appearing less frequently due to Brown gradually losing her eyesight . In January 2016 , it was announced that Brown had renewed her contract with the BBC . 
 A tragicomic character , Dot is known for her devout Christian faith , gossiping , chain smoking , hypochondria , and motherly attitude to those in need . A recurring storyline in the serial has been Dot 's continuous forgiveness of her son 's villainous crimes . Initially married at the start of the series to conman Charlie Cotton ( Christopher Hancock ) , Dot married again in 2002 to pensioner Jim Branning ( John Bardon ) and the union proved to be popular with fans . Brown and Bardon won awards for their screen partnership . On 31 January 2008 , Dot became the first character ever to appear in a monologue episode , " Pretty Baby .... " , of a British soap . The acclaimed episode saw Dot reminiscing about her years of loss and grief into a tape recorder as a message to her ailing husband Jim . Dot has been used to explore topical and controversial issues such as euthanasia , cancer , immigration and homophobia . 
 Dot has been generally well received by critics ; she has been referred to as a cultural archetype and Brown has won multiple awards for her portrayal . However , aspects of the character such as her smoking and her religious beliefs have been criticised , with religious groups suggesting Dot 's faith is used in a pejorative manner . The character has also made an impact on popular culture ; she has been spoofed , most notably by Alistair McGowan , and has been credited as inspiration for catwalk collections .

 Dot 's backstory states that she was born in Walford , the main setting for EastEnders , and was evacuated to Wales as a child during the Second World War . Her guardians , Gwen ( Eve Myles ) and Will ( Dafydd <unk> ) , wished to adopt her , but Dot returned to Walford after Will 's death in a car accident and spent the remainder of her childhood helping her neglectful mother care for her younger half @-@ siblings : Gerry , Tim and Rose ( Polly Perkins ) . 
 Aged 18 , Dot married Charlie Cotton ( Christopher Hancock ) . The following year , he forced her to have an abortion ; threatening to leave her if she did not but left anyway because it was a bigamous marriage .

Dot believes him but later discovers it is a lie and he is on the run from the police . She contacts the police , and he is arrested a week after his return . 
 Dot moves in with fellow senior citizen Lilly <unk> ( Barbara Keogh ) and is arrested for the illegal use of cannabis , which she confuses for herbal tea . When Lilly leaves after she is mugged , Dot moves in with Pauline . Her oldest friend Ethel also comes to stay with the Fowlers for a time , having become terminally ill . Ethel begs Dot to help her end her life . Torn between her Christian beliefs against euthanasia and her best friend 's wishes , she helps Ethel to die , but later feels she should be jailed for murder . When the police do not believe her story , Dot demands retribution in another form and she ends up in court for shoplifting . She initially avoids a prison sentence but is sent down for 14 days for contempt of court following an outburst in the courtroom . 
 When Nick and Ashley ( now Frankie Fitzgerald ) reappear in Walford , Dot is pleased to have her family around and moves out of the Fowler household to live with them . However , Nick 's feud with Mark Fowler ( Todd Carty ) causes Ashley 's death after Nick cuts the brakes on Mark 's motorbike and Ashley steals it and crashes . Dot disowns Nick after Ashley 's funeral , having overheard the truth about Ashley 's death during an earlier argument between Nick and Mark . 
 She starts a relationship with neighbour Jim Branning ( John Bardon ) , but when he proposes , she is overwhelmed and leaves Walford . Jim perseveres and when they go on the London Eye one Christmas Eve , he proposes again and she accepts . They decide that they will have a platonic marital relationship . Dot is diagnosed with kidney cancer and decides not to tell anyone except her friend Dennis Rickman ( Nigel Harman ) . She initially refuses treatment and plans to die quietly , but is eventually persuaded to undergo chemotherapy and makes a full recovery . 
 When Dot finds an abandoned baby , Tomas , in a church , she takes him home , leaving her contact details at the church and subsequently Tomas 's mother Anya ( Olga Fedori ) arrives in Walford , revealing she is an illegal immigrant . Jim anonymously reports Anya and when she is deported , Dot hides Tomas from the authorities , vowing to take care of him . Dot and Jim struggle to look after the baby and , after talking to the local vicar and her old friend Dr. Legg ( Leonard Fenton ) , Dot decides to hand him over to social services . 
 Jim suffers a stroke , leaving him seriously ill . Jim is placed in a nursing home , but Dot struggles with this decision and tries at a later date to care for Jim at home . However , she finds being a full @-@ time carer exhausting and lonely . Eventually , after Dot experiences ill @-@ health brought on by stress , Jim moves back to a nursing home . 
 When Nick returns after a seven @-@ year absence , he tells Dot he has changed and is now a plumber , introducing her to his six @-@ year @-@ old daughter Dotty Cotton ( Molly Conlin ) . However , Dot discovers that Nick is only there for her money . She refuses to pay him , so he tells her if she does not , she cannot see Dotty . Dot gives Nick the money and looks after Dotty . It is revealed Dotty and Nick are planning to kill Dot for her life insurance . They convince her that she has symptoms of dementia , but their plan backfires when Dotty exposes the plot . In a rage , Nick holds various members of the community hostage , resulting in an explosion . Nick survives and after being disowned again by Dot , he informs her that Dotty had masterminded the murder plot before fleeing . Dotty is retrieved by her mother , Sandy ( Caroline Pegg ) , following various devious deeds , such as accusing Dot of beating her , which leads to Dot being questioned by the police for child abuse . Nevertheless , Dot is sorry to see Dotty go . 
 Dot develops a friendship with vicar Edward Bishop ( Frank Barrie ) , who develops romantic intentions towards her . Dot turns Edward down , remaining loyal to her husband . She takes in various lodgers , including Arthur " Fatboy " Chubb ( Ricky Norwood ) , her sister Rose and Cora Cross ( Ann Mitchell ) , who causes Dot problems with the council for failing to pay the rent , leaving her in arrears . Dot is taken to court but manages to persuade the judge to allow her keep her home and avoids a prison sentence . Fatboy later allows his girlfriend Poppy Meadow ( Rachel Bright ) to move in with him and Dot , and Dot forms a close bond with Poppy . When Fatboy and Poppy break up and Poppy moves out , Fatboy gently assures Dot that her and Poppy are still friends . 
 Dot receives a police visit , informing her that Nick has died . One of the police officers returns later to tell her that he is actually her grandson Charlie Cotton ( Declan Bennett ) , a child of Nick 's Dot had not known existed . A devastated Dot holds a funeral for Nick and grows close to Charlie in the aftermath as he moves in with Dot , causing Fatboy to move out . However it is later revealed that Charlie is being dishonest and although he is Nick 's son , he is not a policeman but a caretaker and that he has helped Nick stage his own death to avoid being arrested following a robbery . Nick reappears in Walford to Dot 's shock and persuades his mother to hide him at her house . Although horrified that Charlie and Nick lied to her , she forgives Charlie and agrees to aid Nick 's escape from the UK , this time for good . However , Nick later realises that he does not want to leave and gets embroiled in a feud with Charlie 's fiancée Ronnie Mitchell ( Samantha Womack ) who tries and fails to ensure his departure . This leads to Nick tampering with the brakes of Charlie 's car and the resulting crash leaves a pregnant Ronnie comatose in hospital . When Charlie discovers this , he demands that Nick leave , and as Charlie moves out to live at Ronnie 's flat , Fatboy moves back in with Dot . However , Dot , unwilling to give up on her son , hides Nick in a derelict neighbouring house . Unable to leave the premises , Nick starts using heroin again but cannot feed his drug addiction and asks Dot to obtain drugs for him .

She changes her plea and is cleared of murder at the court hearing ; however , she is found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to prison for 14 months . 
 Four months later , Dot is released and shares her regret with Ian that she did not report Nick 's crimes earlier in life , as to stop him from spiralling out of control . Fatboy tells Dot he is spending Christmas with his father , but later Vincent Hubbard ( Richard Blackwood ) discovers Fatboy 's belongings amongst some blood in the boot of a crushed car and tells Dot that Fatboy is not coming back because of a job abroad . 
 = = Creation = = 
 Although Dot had been referred to since the very early episodes of the programme as the mother of villain Nick Cotton ( John Altman ) , she did not actually appear on @-@ screen until July 1985 , episode 40 . Dot was conceptualised by show creators , Tony Holland and Julia Smith , along with the other original characters . Introduced as the " bible thumping , arch @-@ gossip " of the launderette , Dot was a character who bridged the generations . The actress June Brown was given the role after being recommended by actor Leslie Grantham , who played original character , Den Watts . 
 Brown was offered the part of Dot Cotton for a period of three months initially and in her own words , she was brought in " merely to be Nick Cotton 's mother because Nick was coming back again " . Brown has told Decca <unk> of The Guardian in 2009 that she was wary of joining a soap opera as she had seen EastEnders once on television , " and there was an argument going on , and I thought , ' Oh , I don 't want to watch all that , ' so I switched it off . I didn 't watch it again until I was asked to be in it . " The role was extended and the character has become one of the longest @-@ running to have featured in EastEnders . 
 = = = Becoming Dot ; characterisation = = = 
 = = = = Appearance = = = = 
 In order to become the character of Dot Cotton , Brown is required to wear a wig to replicate Dot 's 1950s " Italian Boy " hairstyle that has remained in a largely unchanged style since she first appeared in 1985 . Although Brown now wears a wig , for many years the hair sported by Dot actually belonged to the actress . Brown has stated that as soon as Dot 's hairpiece is on , she becomes the character . The unchanged style of Dot was deemed so important by the programme makers , that when Brown requested to have dental work carried out to improve her prominent front teeth , the producers refused to allow it , arguing that Dot could not afford expensive tooth capping . Brown was not permitted to alter her teeth until early 1991 , when they became loose . Brown has indicated that she does not want Dot 's style altered . She claimed in 2002 that Dot had the same coats in her wardrobe that she was given in 1985 . The fur @-@ collared coat Dot wears for special occasions was donated by the character Angie Watts ( Anita Dobson ) in 1988 when she left the serial . Brown commented , " I like the older clothes [ ... ] I don 't want new clothes , I 'm happy the way she is . She thinks she looks really smart . She 's got a terrible opinion of herself that woman ! " 
 = = = = Personality and religion = = = = 
 Brown has said that when she was cast as Dot , she was given a list of illnesses the character had . She added , " It meant she was a <unk> [ sic ] because she had nobody to care about her . She was quite a selfish woman [ initially ] . " Dot has been described by author Hilary Kingsley as a " born victim . " She adds that " with each blow that life delivers [ Dot ] bobs back up again , almost asking for more trouble , more pain , more suffering . " Dot is renowned for being a hypochondriac , her Christian faith and quoting from the Bible . She has been described by Rupert Smith , author of 20 Years in Albert Square , as " God @-@ bothering " and self @-@ righteous . According to Kingsley , " nothing shakes Dot 's view that the world is good because the creator made it so . Her faith sustains her through the most appalling ordeals . " The character once expressed part of the reason for her faith on @-@ screen in 2000 , commenting to a vicar , " I couldn 't manage without my faith , not with the life I 've had " ; former executive producer of EastEnders , John Yorke , has stated that this is his favourite line of EastEnders ' entire existence . Author Antony Slide has noted that Dot 's religious beliefs have given her solace , but has given her an excuse to be prejudiced against her neighbours , and to deal with the criminal antics of her wayward son . He described her as a " simpleminded woman whom one loved to hate " . 
 In Kathryn and Phillip Dodd 's published essay , From <unk> to EastEnders , Dot has been used as an example of the media 's representation of the working @-@ class as community @-@ orientated , but defensive : " evangelist @-@ cum @-@ launderette supervisor . Eagle @-@ eyed , she patrols the Square , confronting evil and despair and asking those stricken with doubt to trust God , while simultaneously organizing the local Neighbourhood Watch scheme . " 
 The character has taken on a matriarchal role in the absence of her own family , taking on the burdens of numerous waifs and strays throughout the show 's history , including Donna Ludlow ( Matilda Ziegler ) , Rod Norman ( Christopher <unk> ) , Disa O 'Brien ( Jan <unk> ) , Nigel Bates ( Paul Bradley ) and Clare Bates ( Gemma Bissix ) . Author Christine Geraghty asserts that Dot 's role in the mothering structure of the serial has been confirmed . 
 Describing Dot , Brown has said , " I love playing her – she 's a strong character . Dear old Dot , she 's got strong moral views and odd religious beliefs , but her heart 's in the right place . She has that awful worried expression on her face the whole time " . Brown has noted the changes within Dot since the show 's inception , saying that initially Dot was sharp and selfish , but since her character remarried in 2002 , she has gained security and has " no reason to have the hypochondria she had in the past [ ... ] She 's become more caring over the years . She enjoys the company of young people . She loves her church . She can get in an anxious state – I like it when Dot 's hysterical ! She 's also amusing , mostly because she doesn 't realise she is " . 
 = = = = Comedic role = = = = 
 As well as being tragic , Dot is scripted as a comic character . Brown has discussed the humour she incorporates into her performances : " I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren 't a bit comic [ ... ] I always thought I had to put an edge on it , an edge of comedy , which just means doing it more seriously than you would do . If you want to play comedy then you have to be very intense about it [ ... ] very , very serious . " Some of Dot 's catchphrases are used for humour , such as " Ooh I say ! " , uttered when she is " stuck for words " . In 2004 , Brown discussed the origin of the saying : " It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it , so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn 't in the scripts . It was useful because it could be said in all different ways . Dot 's very straight @-@ laced , so it helped to express her horror at what went on . " Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this , along with the mispronunciation of her employer , Mr <unk> , as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known . Mr. <unk> is the owner of the launderette where Dot works . In a long @-@ running joke , Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname , and for much of the show 's history he has been referred to as Mr. <unk> , <unk> , or varying other mispronunciations . Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot , stating , " She 's not dreadfully funny but she 's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit . " 
 = = = = Smoking = = = = 
 Smoking cigarettes has become synonymous with Dot , and Brown has suggested that the habit is " intrinsic " to the character . Following the 2007 England smoking ban , it was reported in the Daily Mail that the BBC were refusing to prohibit the character from smoking on @-@ screen despite the act being banned in workplaces , as they have " to portray real life – and people smoke " . Dot 's smoking was criticised by private healthcare company <unk> in 2008 , when they rated her television 's most unhealthy character . They suggest that , in order to spread a public message , Dot should appear breathless , not with " implausibly good health " . They added , " Though Dot Cotton has a smoker 's voice – deeper than you might expect , she does not seem to be short of breath or wheezy " and that viewers would be influenced by this . However , Dot 's smoking has been described by broadcasting watchdogs Ofcom as " justified in the context of the programme as a representation of an East End character " and they therefore stipulate that enforcement of broadcast smoking @-@ sanctions would be unlikely on EastEnders . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = The gossip = = = 
 Upon her arrival , Dot Cotton was quickly established as the gossip , whose purpose , as author Anthony Slide sees it , was " that of a Greek chorus , commenting on the foibles of her fellow residents of Albert Square , from her vantage point as manager of the local launderette " . The " gossip " is a soap opera role that author Christine Geraghty has described as " crucial to the audience 's engagement with a serial and provides both a source of information and a means of speculation for the viewer . " She asserts that a fundamental aspect of British soap is the idea of supporting members of community , based on the sharing of intimate knowledge , allowing " practical and emotional needs to be met " within the enclosed community . However , according to Geraghty , there is nevertheless " an unease about the price paid for such support and an acknowledgement of the fine @-@ line between neighbourliness and <unk> . The ' gossip ' personifies this unease and though her task of passing on information and ferreting out problems is crucial to the community , she [ ... ] is frequently the butt of mockery and criticism [ ... ] The avidity with which Dot Cotton seeks out news is the subject of some embarrassment to her more restrained neighbours but the exchange of information she provides is essential if the community is to provide support to its members [ ... ] the very process of exchanging information makes her an essential yet mistrusted figure . " 
 Indeed , it has been noted that , throughout the soap 's early years , Dot was portrayed as a " lovable bigot " , prejudiced against her neighbours and only happy when others were not . During the 1980s , Dot was shown to exhibit both racism and homophobia to members of the Walford community . In 1987 , Dot was shown to respond negatively to Colin Russell ( Michael Cashman ) upon learning he was gay , reacting in " horror and ignorant self @-@ righteousness " and spreading rumours that Colin had AIDS . According to Gary Loach from <unk> , Dot was being used by the programme makers to expose the bigotry of the " moral majority " in the real world following a public and media backlash over EastEnders ' screening of its first homosexual kiss . However , while Dot has portrayed bigotry , author Anthony Slide has noted that the character can typically be " relied upon to drop her prejudices – she learned to accept both blacks and homosexuals in Albert Square . " 
 Despite Dot 's remaining penchant for gossip , it has been noted by Cole Moreton of The Independent in 2008 that the character has " evolved from a nasty gossip into a strong character for whom viewers feel warmth " . Author Dorothy Hobson has discussed this in her book Soap Opera , suggesting that Dot , while providing a narrative function as a gossip , has in turn been the subject of other people 's gossip , with her own problems , troubles and vulnerability . 
 = = = Notable relationships = = = 
 = = = = Nick = = = = 
 Dot 's relationship with her wayward son Nick ( John Altman ) , has been a feature of the character 's narrative since her inception . Unlike Dot , Nick is scripted as a semi @-@ regular character , one who comes and goes sporadically and , as authors Jill Marshall and Angela <unk> have observed , " we know heartache is in store for Dot Cotton every time her son , ' Nasty Nick ' , turns up [ ... ] The recurrence of generic elements means we derive pleasure from expectation and prediction . " 
 Executive producer Diederick Santer has discussed the " wonderfully dysfunctional mother @-@ son relationship " Nick shares with Dot and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance regardless of his history of wrongdoing . Santer explained : " There ’ s that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone ’ s changed , which is really tragic . They ’ ve let you down a hundred times , and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they ’ ll have changed . " Actor Leslie Grantham has stated that Dot is the " one friend in [ Nick 's ] life " , while series story producer Dominic Treadwell @-@ Collins has affirmed : " Dot ’ s always going to forgive him . And that ’ s the beauty of Nick and Dot . " Concurring with this sentiment , John Altman ( Nick ) agreed : " No matter what he does , she ’ ll forgive him . So did a lot of gangsters ' mothers throughout history . Probably Al Capone 's mother thought he was a sweet lad , you know . " 
 One of Nick 's most notable returns to the series occurred in 1990 . Nick returned to his mother 's life with the claim that he was a born @-@ again Christian , which happened to coincide with her £ 1000 win on the bingo . EastEnders writer Sarah Phelps explained : " For Dot , the idea that Jesus had finally spoken to Nick , that was all her Christmases coming at once ! Nick knew that . It was sort of obvious that Nick could be saying ' Jesus walks with me ' and then just go out and kick somebody or nick their wallet . " With the help of a fake priest , Nick managed to convince his mother of his new @-@ found faith and then began a slow campaign to control her eating habits and poison her in order to claim her money . Discussing the storyline , scriptwriter Colin Brake has indicated that at first it was not clear to the audience whether Nick had reformed or not , but as the weeks passed it became obvious that he did intend to kill his mother , as he was shown practising a fake suicide note in Dot 's handwriting – a foil to cover the intended murder ; according to Brake , Dot remained blithely and perhaps purposefully ignorant to his wrongdoing . The episode which culminated the storyline , written by P.J. Hammond , was set solely in Dot 's house and featured an unusually small cast consisting of Nick , Dot , Nick 's estranged father Charlie , Dot 's close friend Ethel Skinner and Alistair the fake priest . At the last moment , in what Altman has called the " one time we saw a glimmer of Nick ’ s good side " , Nick backed out of his plan and stopped Dot from eating the poisoned meal he had intended to kill her with . Once again Dot was left alone , broken @-@ hearted at what her own son had been prepared to do to her . 
 Other storylines have concentrated on Dot 's various attempts to reform Nick , such as in 1991 , when Nick returned with a heroin addiction . As the plot unfolded , Dot tried to curtail Nick 's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey . His resulting paranoia and cravings led him to escape and murder the first person he encountered , The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle ( Michael Melia ) . The episode where Eddie was murdered was the big autumn launch episode for 1991 . Nick stood trial in January 1993 ; however , " he got away with murder " for a second time in the serial . Other scams have included Nick 's attempt to con Dot by claiming he had AIDS in 1998 after escaping from prison , which ultimately led to Dot having him re @-@ imprisoned . Then followed a plot that saw him largely responsible for the death of his son Ashley ( Frankie Fitzgerald ) in 2001 , ultimately leading Dot to disown Nick . 
 Following pleas from Brown to resurrect Nick , John Altman returned to the serial again in December 2008 , in a storyline that saw Nick attempt to con Dot again , this time aided by a previously unheard of daughter , Dotty ( Molly Conlin ) . Altman explained : " Nick needed something , because I think if he didn ’ t have little Dotty , for him to walk through that door , she would just have treated him as a complete outcast . " As the storyline progressed , it was revealed that Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance ; they concocted a plan to make her think she had developed dementia then overdose her with sleeping pills , which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot . 
 In March 2014 , Dot is told by the police that Nick has died of respiratory failure from a heroin overdose the previous week . One of the police officers who breaks the news to Dot is Nick 's son Charlie Cotton , although it is later revealed that he is impersonating a police officer . Charlie explains that he was conceived from a brief marriage Nick had with his mother Yvonne . During the funeral , Charlie and undertaker Les Coker prevent Dot from looking in the coffin . Dot is suspicious and invites Yvonne to tell the truth and she assures Dot that Charlie is her grandson . A few weeks later , Carol Jackson asks Charlie for advice , when he leaves his phone at her house , she answers a call and discovers that Nick is still alive . 
 Nick reappears in Albert Square seven @-@ months after his faked death . Ronnie takes an instant dislike to him and tries to bribe him to leave but Nick returns for Charlie and Ronnie 's wedding . Nick decides to get revenge on Ronnie and cuts the brakes of her car . After the wedding , Roxy , Charlie and Ronnie are involved in an accident which hits and later kills Emma <unk> . Ronnie is put in a coma . Yvonne discovers that Nick cut the brakes of the car . Yvonne tells Charlie but he does not believe her until he catches Nick with some of the money Ronnie used to bribe him . Then Nick implicates Yvonne in Ronnie 's accident , so Charlie asks them both to leave . Dot hides Nick next door and obtains heroin for Nick . Later she finds him unconscious , Nick regains consciousness briefly but later dies in Dot 's arms , in the same location that Reg Cox was discovered 30 years prior .

 Like Nick , Dot 's first screen husband , Charlie Cotton ( Christopher Hancock ) , was also a semi @-@ regular character who came and went throughout his duration in the show . Depicted as bigamous and a conman , Charlie typically would reappear in the show whenever he needed money or temporary accommodation and , because of Dot 's Christian ideals regarding forgiveness , Charlie would always be permitted to return . According to Christopher Hancock , Charlie was " a truly revolting character , a loser . " 
 Producers decided to kill Charlie off in 1991 ; Charlie died off @-@ screen after having a motor accident in his lorry . The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie 's son , Nick . Nick had been involved in a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990 , and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again , something major had to occur in her narrative , that being the death of her husband . Storyline editor , Andrew Holden , has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991 : " We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life . But the problem was how ? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother . Dot isn 't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick . How do we get out of this ? So we made [ Nick ] a heroin addict . That made him vulnerable , in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him . We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only in a state of shock and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him . She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick . She feels it 's her last chance . As a widow Dot enters new territory . Dot 's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions , one of which is that she is better than [ her friend ] Ethel because she has a husband . She is going to have a lot of scope [ ... ] Dot 's life is going to change . " Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme makers to change their minds . She comments , " I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off . I would have preferred if they 'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day . I went to see the writers and put this forward . I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body . Charlie may have picked up a hitch @-@ hiker and he was the one who died . John Altman , who plays Nick , was also sorry about Charlie . We weren 't thinking just about Christopher Hancock , who played Charlie so well , it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste . But I was too late , I couldn 't change their minds . In the past I have talked things through and I was listened to " . 
 Charlie 's funeral episode , written by Linda <unk> , was aired on 11 July 1991 , and was dominated by Dot 's reaction to Charlie 's death and her trip to identify his body . It is selected by writer Colin Brake as one of 1991 's episodes of the year .

 Dot 's second significant romance was built upon by scriptwriters in 2000 on the behest of producer John Yorke . Dot was paired romantically with pensioner Jim Branning , played by John Bardon and a slow courtship was featured , with Dot often shown to be outraged by Jim 's advances , resulting in numerous rejections . Dot finally succumbed and accepted his marriage proposal in an episode that aired in November 2001 ; the scenes were filmed inside one of the carriages of the London Eye on the South Bank of the River Thames . Their wedding aired on 14 February 2002 , Valentine 's Day . The Guardian critic , Nancy Banks @-@ Smith , described the wedding as " uniquely uneventful [ ... ] For Dot and Jim ' In sickness and health ... till death do us part ' seemed to carry more resonance than for most . " 
 Bardon has revealed that both he and Brown were sceptical about their characters marrying . In an interview with American fan @-@ based newspaper , Walford Gazette , he commented , " No way did the pair of us want to get married because we thought if we got married , we 'd sit indoors and watch the telly every night . As it happened , we 've had some nice things to do . And we are married , and it 's worked out all right . " Brown has reiterated that she feared Dot would become boring if she married Jim , but that producers persuaded her that the marriage might be a good thing . On @-@ screen , Dot had suffered the death of her grandson Ashley , and Brown felt that a traumatic event like that would have changed her character . In her opinion , the only way Dot would have got over Ashley 's death " would be to have someone else to care for and when it happened there was nobody [ but ] with marrying Jim she gets a family – that 's what persuaded me . That house will become a house again – it will have a central point , they will be able to use the house as a central point , as Dot will be there . " 
 Critic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to Coronation Street 's Hilda and Stan Ogden , comparing a scene in EastEnders where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from Coronation Street , that aired decades before . Brown discussed Dot 's relationship with Jim in 2004 : " Initially , Jim wasn 't the sort of person that Dot approved of . He drank , he gambled , he lied – he wasn 't reliable at all . But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot – heaven knows why ! I think that you always have to work out for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation . I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [ ... ] His kindness drew her towards him . [ ... ] Dot 's definitely in control of Jim . She quite enjoys bossing him around . " Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon , saying " We work very well together – he 's got great timing and he can be very tender too . " 
 The on @-@ screen relationship between Dot and Jim was halted in 2007 when Jim was hastily written out of the soap due to Bardon 's health problems . In the script Jim suffered a stroke and was placed in the care of off @-@ screen relatives . Dot and Jim remained together , with Jim making sporadic appearances between 2008 and 2009 to visit Dot . A more permanent return for the character was announced in 2009 . However , it was reported in April 2011 that Bardon had filmed his exit from the series , and that the show 's staff believed it marked the end of the character . A source told the Daily Mirror : " Dot 's been struggling for a while and realises that she can no longer give Jim the care and attention he deserves and is forced to make the heartbreaking decision that he should move into a home . [ ... ] It was very emotional on the set for the scenes where Dot discusses her decision and talks to Jim about him going into care for good . There were a lot of tears . [ ... ] The feeling is that this is the end of Jim as a character because he won 't leave the home and won 't ever be a regular in Albert Square again . " It was reported that Jim could still appear in the care home if Bardon 's health permitted it . Jim left the show on 26 May 2011 . Brown opined that Dot would feel lonely without Jim , saying , " I think she 'll be very lonely and feel she doesn 't have much purpose in life . It was really important to tell this story because there are so many people in a similar situation to Dot . It was moving to act out , too — not just because of Dot and Jim 's relationship , but because I 'm really good friends with John Bardon in real life . "

 In May 2011 , it was reported that Dot 's estranged half sister , Rose , would join the series , played by Polly Perkins . Reports stated that Dot and Rose fell out when the latter had an affair with the former 's husband , Charlie , but Dot would decide to track Rose down after suffering a bout of hypochondria , feeling it is time to put things right , however , Rose will not be pleased to see Dot again after so many years . 
 = = = = Friendships = = = = 
 An enduring friendship featured in EastEnders was the one shared between the characters Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner ( played by Gretchen Franklin ) , first shown on @-@ screen in 1985 and ending with Ethel 's death in 2000 , though the characters shared a backstory set prior to 1985 and were scripted as neighbours who grew old together in East London , along with Lou Beale ( Anna Wing ) . BBC News has described Dot and Ethel as an " incomparable double @-@ act [ ... ] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious " . Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality . During an episode that aired in 2008 , just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial , Dot discussed the differences between them : " Ethel was a free spirit , not like me . All bottled up . I remember sitting on the step of the Vic , waiting for me mother . I caught a glimpse of her through the door . Sitting on top of the piano , her legs spread , showing next week 's washing and bawling out " Roll Out the Barrel " . Just like a navvy . She didn 't seem to have a care in the world . I had enough for both of us . I loved Ethel . " Critic for The Guardian , Nancy Banks @-@ Smith , discussed the characters ' relationship in 2008 , comparing them to the girls written about by Dylan Thomas : " There was always one pretty and pert [ Ethel ] , and always one in glasses [ Dot ] . " Banks @-@ Smith adds that theirs was " a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy . Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship . " 
 Their bickering and personality differences were often used for comic effect ; however , in episode 248 of the show , scriptwriter Colin Brake notes that viewers were shown a different side to Ethel and Dot 's friendship in the soaps second two @-@ hander episode . The episode aired in July 1987 and featured just the two old ladies ( although Dot was Ethel 's junior by twenty years or so ) . Brake has described the episode as a " mini @-@ play about nostalgia and growing old " , adding that " some viewers found it too unusual , but many others were charmed by the change of pace " . According to Brake , the episode gave Franklin and Brown the opportunity to show the sadness behind the often comical characters of Ethel and Dot . The episode was written by Charlie Humphreys and directed by Mike Gibbon , a future producer of the show . Author Christine Geraghty has used the episode as an example of the fact that " female conversation is the backbone to traditional soap " . 
 Author Dorothy Hobson has discussed the use of older female characters in British soap opera as a means of providing comedy . She compares Ethel and Dot 's function in EastEnders to the trio of Ena Sharples , Minnie Caldwell and Martha Longhurst from Coronation Street with regard to providing humour . She has noted that following Ethel 's retirement from the serial , the production team at EastEnders attempted to replicate Dot and Ethel 's friendship by introducing a number of " ' friends ' to fulfil the same function of a female friend for Dot and the series . " An example of this was the character Lilly <unk> ( Barbara Keogh ) who appeared between 1998 and 1999 . The author goes on to note that Ethel 's role in Dot 's narrative was difficult to replace because " far from being complete stereotypes , their relationships depend on them being long @-@ standing friends with the ability to share stories and reminisce . For the characters to ' work ' there is a need for unspoken intimacy and a shared knowledge for each other 's lives . They carry the internal knowledge of the narratives and share that knowledge with the audience . " Brown has spoken about the " wonderful rapport " she had with Gretchen Franklin who played Ethel . She added , " I do miss Ethel , it was great with Dot and Ethel . They did try and stop us working together at one time , but the producer changed and it all went back to where it started . " 
 Throughout her time in EastEnders , many of Dot 's scenes have been set in Walford 's launderette , where the character has worked as an assistant for almost the entire duration of her time in EastEnders . Here , Dot was frequently featured with another long @-@ running protagonist , fellow launderette colleague , Pauline Fowler , played by Wendy Richard from 1985 – 2006 . Author Christine Geraghty has discussed the working environment the women inhabited , indicating that because the owner of the launderette is barely present , the " working relationship hinges on the friendships ( or otherwise ) of the women who work in it " . As with Ethel , Dot and Pauline 's friendship was often used for comedic purposes ; emphasis was placed on their differences , leading to numerous petty squabbles and in 2004 saw them " buried alive " underneath a collapsed fairground ride , in the midst of a cake @-@ selling war . However , Pauline and Dot were most frequently shown gossiping , reminiscing about the past , or sharing their woes in the launderette . The duo has been described by television personality Paul O 'Grady as a " fabulous double @-@ act " : " Dot 's probably Pauline 's one and only confidant . Pauline eventually will break down and tell Dot things that she 'd never tell anybody else . " On the episode marking the screen death of Pauline on 25 December 2006 , Dot remarks to Pauline , “ You ’ re the only real friend I ’ ve got " , in a scene that Tim Teeman of The Times has described as " one of the most moving scenes in a soap [ in 2006 ] " .

 In 1993 , Brown decided to quit EastEnders after becoming " discontented " with the way Dot was portrayed . In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror : " I always felt Dot was one of those characters who should stay the same . She 's a simple creature . There are some people who the same things happen to them again and again . They never learn [ ... ] When I left , there was all that rubbish about it getting too much for me [ but ] I stopped because I wasn 't being used very much . I thought , ' It 's a part @-@ time job ' . It wasn 't being written properly . Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on , [ Dot was hearing the gossip from others ] . [ Dot ] was living on a reputation . [ viewers ] said to me , ' I loved it when [ Dot ] had [ ... ] varicose veins . ' I thought : ' What ? ! That was in 1985 , it 's 1993 ! ' . I was getting so tetchy , so I thought I 'd go . I 'd had enough . They were a bit shocked , because apparently there were some good stories coming up . " Expanding on this in 2008 , Brown stated that she " didn ’ t like what they were doing with Dot – she was meant to spread the gossip . Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I know , people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought , ‘ No , this just won ’ t do ’ . I was very annoyed , I felt like they had completely changed my character . " The character departed on @-@ screen in August 1993 , when Dot moved away from the soap 's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend , Kent . 
 In October 1996 , newspapers reported that BBC bosses had approached Brown about reprising her role as Dot Cotton and , according to the Daily Mirror , Brown had been in negotiations with EastEnders for several months prior . Brown is quoted by the paper as saying , " I have always been reluctant to go back because I thought Dot 's character was not being portrayed properly . I thought it had faded . I always said if Dot comes back it must be as Dot . " Brown secured a deal to return and began filming on @-@ location in Gravesend in February 1997 . The episode saw Dot 's former lodger , Nigel Bates ( Paul Bradley ) , visiting Dot to discover that Nick was once again in prison , leaving Dot alone . Her return episode aired in April 1997 . Brown has since revealed that she opted to return to EastEnders to raise her profile again . She had originally only intended to return for a 3 @-@ month stint , but was persuaded to stay when a project she had been working on was cancelled . In July 1997 , she commented , " I 've decided to stay in EastEnders . They asked me , and in the end I thought : ' Oh well , I might as well . ' Everyone , including Barbara Windsor , Wendy Richard and Adam Woodyatt , was saying : ' Don 't leave ' . And people were coming up in the street saying : ' It 's lovely to have you back . ' Anyway , I find playing the old dear quite fun . " After a 5 @-@ month break , following Dot being held hostage in her flat by the escaped convict friend of her son , Brown returned to filming in October 1997 on a permanent contract .

 = = = = Euthanasia = = = = 
 In 2000 , Dot was featured in a storyline about euthanasia , when her oldest friend Ethel , who had terminal cancer , asked her to help her die . The storyline allowed the production team to present all sides of the debate about euthanasia , from the perspective of the sufferer and from the person who is asked to assist in the mercy killing , religious and moral opposition . According to author Dorothy Hobson , " Dot suffered torment as she struggled with her conscience and she tried to resist the request [ ... ] to assist [ Ethel ] in the ultimate sin " . In the storyline , Ethel enjoyed the last days of her life and chose her final evening . Assisted by Dot , she took an overdose of her medication and died . Written by Simon Ashton and directed by Francesca Joseph the episode ended with a scene in which Ethel tells a weeping Dot " you 're the best friend I ever had " . Alternative credit music replaced the typical drum beats and theme tune at the end of the episode . The 1931 song used instead of the usual theme was " Guilty " by Al <unk> . Ben <unk> from The Observer has suggested that Dot 's part in the euthanasia storyline was " one of the most moving dramatic sequences shown in recent years on British TV " . The episode was voted the most emotional soap death in a Radio Times poll of 4 @,@ 000 readers in 2006 . 
 The repercussions of the euthanasia for Dot 's character have been described as " extremely serious " as she suffered from " untold guilt and felt that she needed to be punished for the action . " The Executive Producer overseeing this storyline , John Yorke , has discussed the storyline in a speech given at the Bishops ' Conference for clergy and other ministers in the Diocese of St Albans : " Dot , as a good Christian , refused to help , until her love for her friend overcame her own fear of damnation . <unk> with an intolerable burden of guilt , she felt there was only one person she could talk to [ Jesus ] The Dot and Ethel storyline played out in over four months with many similar scenes , to an average audience of 16 million viewers . Dot [ ... ] explored the full panoply of religious belief before coming back to terms with her maker . When Alan <unk> took over as head of religious broadcasting at the BBC he described EastEnders for the weeks the Dot and Ethel story ran as ' the best religious programme on television ' and compared [ it ] to Graham Greene . While we felt a little uncomfortable in such exalted company , what it did show is that handled properly an audience is able to engage in , and relate to profound ethical debate . " 
 Deborah <unk> , CEO of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society ( VES ) , has praised the storyline . In 2004 she commented , " It was a sympathetic portrayal . It demonstrated to a lot of people their own experiences . Lots of us have had conversations with someone , particularly our mothers and fathers , where they have said to us : ' If I get really ill , you will end it , won 't you ? ' The Dot / Ethel storyline showed just what that conversation can entail and what happens to the other person after – the guilt and pain they have to live with . " 
 Such was the controversy surrounding this storyline that the University of Glamorgan uses the plot as part of their new approach to the study of British criminal law . Part of the law foundation course involves studying the soap opera and giving students the chance to decide if Dot Cotton 's character is guilty of murder . The storyline is also featured in GCSE Religious Studies text books . 
 = = = = Kidney cancer = = = = 
 In a 2004 plot , Dot was diagnosed with kidney cancer . The programme makers sought advice from health care professionals when devising the storyline , including specialist information nurses from <unk> . Nurse Martin <unk> said , " We drew on our experience of talking to the thousands of people who call our helpline , to help advise the EastEnders scriptwriters . Many people react to a cancer diagnosis as Dot does in the BBC serial – with confusion and fear . We also speak to family and friends affected by the illness and those living with continuing uncertainty . EastEnders explores all these issues , and hopefully will help improve people 's understanding of what it 's like to be affected by a cancer diagnosis . " 
 According to Macmillan Cancer Support , " Dot 's experience [ increased ] people 's understanding of the emotional impact of a cancer diagnosis ; how the illness affects family and friends ; and what it 's like to live with uncertainty . It also [ helped ] to raise awareness of a comparatively rare cancer and the fact that cancer is a disease most often affecting older people . " 
 Brown herself has confessed that she was unhappy with the storyline as she felt playing illness was not productive at her age . Discussing Dot 's reluctance to reveal her illness to anyone , Brown said " [ it 's ] ironic because I 've played her as a hypochondriac , longing for attention , for 20 years . Now something 's wrong , she doesn 't want anyone to know . " 
 = = = = Abandoned baby = = = = 
 In the Easter 2007 episode , Dot takes an abandoned baby she finds in a church . This was filmed in Kent at Stansted , St. Giles Church in Wormshill , The Ringlestone Inn near Harrietsham and Court Lodge Farm . After being contacted by the child 's Ukrainian mother Anya , Dot offers to care for both of them , however Jim turns Anya in to the authorities for being an illegal immigrant . Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury questioned the plausibility of the storyline , observing : " Babies aren 't abandoned in the real world very often . But you can barely cross [ Albert ] Square [ ... ] without tripping over poor tots who their mothers don 't want . " Laws also felt that the speed at which the immigration department operated was " amazingly on @-@ the @-@ ball " , when in reality many illegal immigrants " slip through the net " . The Daily Mail 's Jaci Stephen deemed the storyline one of the worst in EastEnders ' history , writing a critical review in which she opined that the use of the infant playing Tomas was tantamount to abuse , and criticised several scenes which saw the baby " screeching until he was red in the face . " Stephen questioned : " How can the show justify this and , more to the point , how can his real @-@ life mother stand by and do nothing to comfort the poor little mite ? " 
 = = = Monologue = = = 
 In January 2008 , Dot became the first soap opera character to be featured in a monologue episode , known as a " single @-@ hander " . Written by Tony Jordan , the episode features Dot recording a message for Jim , who is in hospital recovering from a stroke . The episode is entitled " Pretty Baby .... " , named after the song of the same name by Tony Jackson , which replaced the drumbeats and EastEnders ' theme tune that typically accompanies the end credits of episodes . Brown was nominated in the Best Actress category at the 2009 British Academy Television Awards for her performance in the episode , becoming the first soap actress nominated in the category since 1988 , when Jean Alexander was shortlisted for her role as Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street . 
 = = Reception = = 
 According to author Pauline Frommer , Dot has been embraced by the viewing British population as a cultural archetype . Brown has suggested that Dot has universal appeal because everybody knows a person like Dot . In 2009 , a poll by magazine Inside Soap named Dot as the UK 's ' greatest gossip ' in a soap opera . 
 Brown was nominated for the ' Best Actress ' BAFTA award for Dot 's single @-@ hander EastEnders episode in 2009 ; she became the first soap actress nominated in the category since 1988 , when Jean Alexander was shortlisted for her role as Hilda Ogden in Coronation Street . The show 's executive producer , Diederick Santer , described Brown 's BAFTA nomination as his proudest moment of 2009 , saying : " I 'm not one to complain to the referee , but it 's beyond me why she didn 't win . Week in , week out , she turns out amazing performances . The audience knew it and we knew it . With the greatest respect to the actress who won , you could hear the audience in the Royal Festival Hall that night sigh with disappointment . It was a missed opportunity by BAFTA – of which I 'm a member – to connect with a big audience . " Brown has also won ' Best Actress ' for her role as Dot at the Inside Soap Awards in 2001 and 2004 , as well as the ' Outstanding Achievement ' award in 2003 , and ' Best Couple ' in 2005 with John Bardon , as Dot and Jim Branning . She and Bardon also won ' Best On @-@ Screen Partnership ' at the British Soap Awards in both 2002 and 2005 , while in 2005 , Brown won a ' Lifetime Achievement ' award for her role , again at the British Soap Awards . The role also resulted in several award nominations including a ' Most Popular Actress ' nomination at the National Television Awards in 2005 , and a ' Best Actress ' nomination at the 2007 TV Quick and TV Choice Awards among others . Dot was also voted the 46th best television character in a television poll entitled The 100 Greatest Television Characters . 
 At the time of the 2005 general election , Labour chiefs feared that an episode of EastEnders in which Dot learned to drive could distract viewers from voting . In the same year , Dot was criticised as revealing an anti @-@ religious bias on the part of the BBC . Dr <unk> Singh , editor of the Sikh Messenger and patron of the World Congress of Faiths suggested that Dot 's endless quoting from the Bible served to ridicule religion . The character has been cited as an example of anti @-@ Christian bias in the media . The BBC were accused of portraying Christians as old @-@ fashioned in 2008 after an episode aired in which Dot asked a gay , male couple to stop kissing . The BBC responded , " EastEnders aims to reflect real life , and this means including and telling stories about characters from many different backgrounds , faiths , religions and sexualities . " In a report to the BBC ’ s Board of Governors in July 2004 regarding religion , Dot was used as an example of how religion can be portrayed as stereotypical " out @-@ of @-@ date and occasionally offensive " in drama and entertainment output , that Christian figures are highlighted because of their faith " rather than seen as normal people who also have a religious belief " . It was suggested that some Christians think Dot " is made deliberately unappealing to audiences by her eccentric traits and hypocritical behaviour " . However , it was also suggested that others think she is convincing . 
 Brown 's single @-@ hander episode of EastEnders received much critical acclaim . The Guardian ' Nancy Banks @-@ Smith deemed Brown possibly the only member of the cast with the exception of Barbara Windsor ( Peggy Mitchell ) capable of carrying such a monologue . Robert Hanks for The Independent wrote that " I don 't ever remember hearing anybody on a soap talk like this before . I mean , like a real person , with real feelings , such as self @-@ pity and a desperate urge for self @-@ preservation . Brown conveyed the seedy gloom of it all beautifully , as well . " Conversely , Tim Teeman posed the question in The Times : " I know she ’ s a national institution and June Brown plays her like a dream , but was last night ’ s Dot Cotton extravaganza really that great ? Or even necessary ? " Teeman opined that : " Quite rightly , the producers want to eke as much gold out of the character and actress as possible : both are fantastic . But this was much @-@ loved character overkill . " He deemed Dot a " soap icon " , however he also assessed that : 
 This was a tour de force for sure – but an indulgent one . It didn ’ t unlock anything substantially new to Dot . [ ... ] Far from making us care more about Dot – we do anyway , it was preaching to the converted – it was a little , well , dull . Boring even . [ ... ] [ T ] he episode revealed a nagging weakness : Coronation Street has a fine repertory of older characters and actors which gives the show its wonderful link to the past . In EastEnders , the same <unk> roles are played by Dot and Ian Beale : she is a jewel but , as she said , an all @-@ too lonely one . Cherish her , absolutely , but don ’ t turn her into a drag act . 
 The Daily Telegraph 's Gerard O 'Donovan agreed that " June Brown , as Dot , was mesmerising " , but was similarly critical of the episode as a whole , concluding : " Overall [ ... ] the feeling couldn ’ t be avoided that in the greater scheme of things this was a fuss over nothing . Had it been a swan song , it would have been a worthy one . But doubtless Dot will be out and about again tonight , fag in hand , quoting from the Good Book . Enjoyable as this Albert Square indulgence was , I suspect that most fans will be hoping this one @-@ hander remains a one @-@ off . " Leigh Holmwood for The Guardian suggested that viewers may have agreed with O 'Donovan 's assessment , highlighting the fact that the episode received only 8 @.@ 7 million viewers , compared to 9 @.@ 4 million watching EastEnders the previous week . A 2003 episode centred around Dot also resulted in a notable ratings slump . The New Year episode , which detailed her childhood evacuation to the countryside , received just 8 @.@ 1 million viewers , compared with <unk> the previous evening and 16m on Christmas Day . Prior to this , however , a 2002 two @-@ hander episode featuring just Dot and Sonia Jackson ( Natalie Cassidy ) was watched by 11 @.@ 5 million viewers , with an almost 60 % share of viewers in the timeslot .

 The character of Dot Branning has been spoofed in the cartoon sketch show <unk> . She was also impersonated by Alistair McGowan in his television series Big Impression . As part of the sketch , Dot and her son Nick were morphed into a version of the sitcom duo Steptoe and Son . McGowan stated in 2001 that Dot was his favourite impression , because he " looks a bit like her " . 
 Dot 's old @-@ fashioned style of dress has been likened to the clothing collection of Prada 's designer , Miuccia Prada . Dot has been said to have inspired clothing , hairstyles and has been quoted by various fashion professionals as a style icon . She has also inspired catwalk themes , such as that of aspiring designer Hollie Luxton in 2007 , who stated , " I wanted to capture the nostalgia of the bygone days and play with the idea of clothing coming out of the wash misshapen and faded . " 
 Dot 's long @-@ suffering luckless life has also led to her being labelled as a gay icon by Tim <unk> of the Evening Standard . The monthly Dot Cotton Club , a gay club night in Cambridge , is named in her honour . 
 Dot is a notable smoker on British television as she regularly appears on @-@ screen smoking . The character is so synonymous with smoking that the term " Dot Cotton syndrome " is used within the health industry to : " describe the elderly population who continue to smoke heavily without registering the health problems they are or will soon suffer from , seeing it as their only pleasure left in life " . 
 Impressionist Francine Lewis performed an impression of Dot Cotton in the seventh series of Britain 's Got Talent . During 2003 , a promotional advertisement for the BBC featuring a character , Fizz , from the children 's television programme The <unk> pulling off a mask and morphing into Dot received complaints . Parents complained that their children were having nightmares and the BBC subsequently moved back the screening times .

 Piracy Funds Terrorism Volume 1 , usually referred to simply as Piracy Funds Terrorism , is a mixtape produced by British recording artist M.I.A. and American DJ Diplo featuring vocal tracks intended for M.I.A. ' s debut album Arular mashed up with samples of other recordings . The mixtape was produced by the two artists at Diplo 's home studio in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . It was not officially released , but was distributed at M.I.A. ' s live shows and via the internet to promote the release of her much @-@ delayed debut album . Despite its unofficial status , several music publications included it in their listings of the best albums of 2004 .

 Recording sessions for Arular , the debut album by M.I.A. , took place during 2003 and 2004 , and the album was originally scheduled to be released in September 2004 . Legal issues relating to the use of samples delayed this release , however , first to December and then into 2005 . During the recording process , M.I.A. met DJ Diplo , and expressed an interest in working with him on a track for the album . Although their initial recording sessions together proved fruitless , Diplo conceived the idea of using the existing vocal tracks recorded for the album to produce a mixtape which could be used to promote the delayed full @-@ length album . M.I.A. extended her stay in the United States and the two artists produced the mixtape at his home studio . 
 = = Music and artwork = = 
 The mixtape includes early mixes of the vocals intended for Arular , mashed up with samples of tracks including " Walk Like an Egyptian " by The Bangles , " Big Pimpin ' " by Jay @-@ Z and " Push It " by Salt @-@ n @-@ Pepa . Tunes by Baby , dead Prez , Missy Elliott , Ciara , LL Cool J and Cutty Ranks are also included . Necessary legal clearance for the use of these samples was not obtained , with the result that the mixtape could not be sold in record shops and could only be distributed by word of mouth . In addition to pop and hip hop , global music styles are included in the mix . The track " Galang " incorporates elements of reggaeton , and three tracks consist of Brazilian baile funk .

 An initial pressing of 1 @,@ 000 copies of the mixtape was produced and given to M.I.A. ' s record label .

He stated that around 2 @,@ 000 copies of the recording were produced in total . 
 In a review for The Village Voice , Robert Christgau said he was more interested in hearing M.I.A.

Which isn 't to deny I also find all these good things in favela funk juxtaposed against ' Walk Like an Egyptian ' . " Rollie Pemberton from Stylus Magazine called Piracy Funds Terrorism " a genre @-@ bending adventure in shattered preconceptions and club killing beats " and said that , based on the strength of the mixtape , M.I.A.

 = Illegality in Singapore administrative law = 
 Illegality is one of the three broad headings of judicial review of administrative action in Singapore , the others being irrationality and procedural impropriety . To avoid acting illegally , an administrative body or public authority must correctly understand the law regulating its power to act and to make decisions , and give effect to it . 
 The broad heading of illegality may be divided into two sub @-@ headings . In the first case , the High Court inquires into whether the public authority was empowered to take a particular course of action or make a decision , and , in the other , whether it exercised its discretion wrongly even though it was empowered to act . Where the Court finds that the public authority had exceeded its jurisdiction or had exercised its discretion wrongly , it may invalidate the act or decision . 
 Under the first sub @-@ heading , a public authority will be considered as having acted illegally if there is no legal basis for the action carried out or the decision made ( simple ultra vires ) , or , more specifically , if the authority has made an error concerning a jurisdictional or precedent fact . A precedent fact error is made when an authority comes to a conclusion in the absence of facts that must objectively exist , or in the presence of facts that must not exist , before it has the power to act or decide . 
 In cases falling under the second sub @-@ heading , a public authority has satisfied all the factual and legal conditions required for exercising a statutory power conferred upon it , but nevertheless may have acted illegally by doing so in a manner contrary to administrative law rules . The grounds of review available under this heading include the authority acting in bad faith , acting on the basis of no evidence or insufficient evidence , making an error of material fact , failing to take into account relevant considerations or taking into account irrelevant ones , acting for an improper purpose , fettering one 's discretion , and not fulfilling a person 's substantive legitimate expectations . 
 = = Introduction = = 
 Illegality is one of the three broad headings of judicial review of administrative action identified in the key English case of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ( " the GCHQ case " , 1983 ) , the others being irrationality and procedural impropriety . As Singapore inherited English administrative law on independence and the Singapore courts continue to follow English cases , the Court of Appeal of Singapore approved this principle in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) . In the GCHQ case , Lord Diplock formulated the concept of illegality as one where " the decision @-@ maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision @-@ making power and must give effect to it . " Where the decision @-@ maker fails to do so , the High Court may be empowered to quash the decision made or the action taken . Determining whether a decision @-@ maker has acted illegally requires " delineating the scope of statutory powers , which is rarely a mechanistic exercise " . 
 Prior to 1968 , courts in the United Kingdom drew a distinction between jurisdictional and non @-@ jurisdictional errors of law . An error of law that affected the jurisdiction of a decision @-@ maker to exercise its statutory powers was judicially reviewable by the court , whereas an error of that did not go towards jurisdiction was not reviewable . However , the House of Lords is regarded as having effectively done away with the distinction in Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission ( 1968 ) by holding that : 
 ... there are many cases where , although the tribunal had jurisdiction to enter on the inquiry , it has done or failed to do something in the course of the inquiry which is of such a nature that its decision is a nullity . It may have given its decision in bad faith . It may have made a decision which it had no power to make . It may have failed in the course of the inquiry to comply with the requirements of natural justice . It may in perfect good faith have misconstrued the provisions giving it power to act so that it failed to deal with the question remitted to it and decided some question which was not remitted to it . It may have refused to take into account something which it was required to take into account . Or it may have based its decision on some matter which , under the provisions setting it up , it had no right to take into account . I do not intend this list to be exhaustive . But if it decides a question remitted to it for decision without committing any of these errors it is as much entitled to decide that question wrongly as it is to decide it rightly . 
 In R. v. Lord President of the Privy Council , ex parte Page ( 1992 ) , the House of Lords expressed the view that Anisminic had " rendered obsolete the distinction between errors of law on the face of the record and other errors of law by extending the doctrine of ultra vires . <unk> it was to be taken that Parliament had only conferred the decision @-@ making power on the basis that it was to be exercised on the correct legal basis : a misdirection in law in making the decision therefore rendered the decision ultra vires . " No case in Singapore has produced a similar opinion , but it appears that the Singapore courts adopt the same position , except perhaps where statutes contain ouster clauses . 
 The various grounds of review under the broad heading of illegality have also been termed " weak " , " broad " , or " general unreasonableness " , to be contrasted with " strong " or Wednesbury unreasonableness . In Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corporation ( 1947 ) , Lord Greene , the Master of the Rolls , remarked that " a person entrusted with a discretion must , so to speak , direct himself properly in law . He must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider . He must exclude from his consideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has to consider . If he does not obey those rules , he may truly be said , and often is said , to be acting ' unreasonably . ' "

 The broad heading of judicial review of illegality may be divided into two sub @-@ headings . In the first case , the High Court inquires into whether the public authority was empowered to take a particular course of action or make a decision , and , in the other , whether it exercised its discretion wrongly even though it was empowered to act . Where the Court finds that the public authority had exceeded its jurisdiction or had exercised its discretion wrongly , it may strike down the decision on the basis of illegality . 
 = = = Whether the public authority was empowered to take action or make a decision = = = 
 = = = = Simple ultra vires = = = = 
 A decision @-@ maker is said to be acting ultra vires ( beyond its powers ) when it does not have the power it purported to have , and therefore there is no basis in law for the impugned action or decision . The ground of judicial review is termed " simple " to distinguish it from a broader conception of ultra vires developed by the courts that was referred to earlier , which essentially encompasses all the forms of illegality mentioned in the rest of this article . 
 As simple ultra vires concerns the exact powers conferred upon government ministers and statutory bodies , statutory interpretation is arguably the most important exercise the courts need to engage in to determine the scope of powers laid out in the statute . Hence , the cases decided are fact @-@ specific and depend upon each court 's interpretation of the relevant statute , making success of the judicial review somewhat unpredictable . The UK case of Attorney General v. Fulham Corporation ( 1921 ) , illustrates this concept . The defendant was a statutory body establishing washhouses and baths for residents who could not afford their own washing facilities . When it subsequently established a laundry service , the defendant was declared to have acted ultra vires since its statutory purpose was not to carry on a business . Even though the business was carried out at a substantial loss , the statute in question did not give the defendant such a power to do so . Accordingly , the plaintiff was entitled to succeed . 
 R. ( Bancoult ) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ( 2000 ) , was a case concerning the forcible removal of the indigenous people of the Chagos Archipelago from Diego Garcia and the prohibition of their return by the Government of the United Kingdom so that the United States could construct a large military base there . This was effected by section 4 of the Immigration Ordinance 1971 of the British Indian Ocean Territory enacted pursuant to section 11 ( 1 ) of the British Indian Ocean Territory Order , which states : " The Commissioner [ for the British Indian Ocean Territory ] may make laws for the peace , order and good government of the Territory , and such laws shall be published in such manner as the Commissioner may direct . " The High Court held that the 1971 Ordinance was ultra vires the Order , since removing a people from their homeland could not be regarded as within the power to make laws for the territory 's " peace , order and good government " . Subsequently , the exclusion of the Chagossians from the land was reimposed by an Order in Council , the British Indian Ocean Territory ( Constitution ) Order 2004 , which was made in the exercise of the royal prerogative . The legality of this Order was upheld by the House of Lords in R. ( Bancoult ) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ( No. 2 ) ( 2008 ) , which overruled the earlier decision . The House of Lords took the view that the phrase " peace , order and good government " did not entitle the courts to substitute their own view on what the phrase required for that of the Government . Laws made pursuant to it were therefore not justiciable . 
 The simple ultra vires doctrine was implicitly applied by the High Court of Singapore in Wong Yip Pui v. Housing and Development Board ( 1984 ) , in which the Court had to determine if the Housing and Development Board ( HDB ) had the power to compulsorily acquire a flat which had been sold to the plaintiff under the Housing and Development Act . Section 48A ( 1 ) ( b ) of the Act stated : 
 The Board may compulsorily acquire any flat , house or other living accommodation sold subject to the provisions of this Part , whether before or after the commencement of the Housing and Development ( Amendment ) Act , 1975 — ... 
 ( b ) if the owner thereof , his spouse or any authorised occupier has at any time , whether before or after the commencement of the Housing and Development ( Amendment ) Act , 1975 , acquired whether by operation of law or otherwise any title to or an estate or interest in any other flat , house or building or land ... [ Emphasis added . ] 
 The phrase authorised occupier was defined in section 2 ( 1 ) of the Act as " a person who is named in an application made to the Board as the person who intends to reside in the flat , house or other living accommodation sold or to be sold by the Board under Part IV or any person who is authorised in writing by the Board to reside therein " . The HDB alleged that it was entitled to seize the plaintiff 's flat as one of the authorised occupiers of the flat – his son – had acquired an interest in other real property . However , the Court held that , on the facts of the case , the plaintiff 's son was not an authorised occupier as defined in the Act . The plaintiff had not applied to the HDB to buy the flat as he had , in fact , been invited by the HDB to buy it . Neither had the Board given any written authorization for the plaintiff 's son to reside in the flat . Thus , the Court granted the plaintiff an order that the HDB 's action in acquiring the flat was illegal , and that the flat should be revested in him . 
 In some instances , a statute does not clearly define what kinds of powers are conferred upon the relevant ministers and statutory bodies . In such a case , difficulty may arise when determining if the governmental action complained of was indeed ultra vires . The case of Public Prosecutor v. Pillay M.M. ( 1977 ) was one in which the High Court grappled with determining what powers were conferred on the Minister for Communications by section 90 ( 1 ) of the Road Traffic Act . The respondent was charged with contravening the Motor Vehicles ( Restricted Zone and Area Licences ) Rules 1975 by driving his car into a restricted zone established under the Singapore Area Licensing Scheme without having paid the requisite fee for doing so . He submitted successfully before a magistrate that the Rules were ultra vires since section 90 ( 1 ) , which stated that the Minister could make rules " generally for the purpose of carrying this Act into effect " , did not confer any power on the Minister to make rules prohibiting motor vehicles from using any road except upon payment of a fee . 
 On an appeal by the Public Prosecutor to the High Court , Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin accepted the appellant 's submission that the Rules were intended to reduce traffic congestion within defined areas of the city , and thus were within the scope of section 90 ( 1 ) since the long title of the Act indicated it was a statute " to make provisions for the regulation of traffic on roads " , among other things . The primary purpose of the Rules was not the collection of fees but the regulation of traffic flow . The Chief Justice also disagreed with the respondent 's submission that the Rules were ultra vires since section 90 ( 1 ) only empowered the Minister to regulate road traffic and not to prohibit it entirely . In the judge 's opinion , the Rules did not wholly prohibit vehicles from using roads within the restricted zone , but merely regulated traffic entering and remaining within the zone . 
 = = = = Errors as to precedent facts = = = = 
 = = = = = Distinction between errors of fact and errors of law = = = = = 
 It has been suggested that a question of fact involves a matter concerning primary facts such as a new witness or what people saw or heard , while a question of law involves an application of a statutory word or phase to such facts . However , this distinction is debatable , and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach , and seek to allow judicial review to take place . In any case , it is said that the courts generally treat errors of fact committed by public authorities differently from errors of law . While errors of law are regarded by the courts as within their jurisdiction and thus subject to judicial review , they show more reluctance to intervene when errors of fact are alleged . 
 Cases involving questions of mixed fact and law are less straightforward . While there are no Singaporean cases that demonstrate this genre of case , the UK case of <unk> v. Hillingdon London Borough Council ( 1986 ) held that : 
 Where the existence or non @-@ existence of a fact is left to the judgment and discretion of a public body and that fact involves a broad spectrum ranging from the obvious to the debatable to the just conceivable , it is the duty of the court to leave the decision of that fact to the public body to whom Parliament has entrusted the decision @-@ making power save in a case where it is obvious that the public body , consciously or unconsciously , are acting perversely . 
 The crux of the case was the interpretation of " homelessness " under the Housing ( Homeless Persons ) Act 1977 , under which a public authority bore a statutory responsibility for providing homeless people with accommodation . The House of Lords ruled that the applicants , who were a married couple living with their two children in a single room in a guest house , were not " homeless " within the ordinary meaning of that expression , and thus were not entitled to relief under the Act . 
 = = = = = Precedent fact errors = = = = = 
 Although the courts will generally avoid judicially reviewing errors of fact , a decision may be quashed if an error was made concerning a jurisdictional or precedent fact . A precedent fact error is made when a decision @-@ maker comes to a conclusion in the absence of facts that must objectively exist , or in the presence of facts that must not exist , before it has the power of decision under legislation . If , say , the statute requires that a particular precedent fact must exist before the decision @-@ maker may exercise the power conferred on it by the legislature , in the absence of the fact there can be no lawful exercise of the power . This is a specific type of simple ultra vires and the discretion involved can be described as being in the " precedent fact category " . 
 The case of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs ( 1988 ) is the leading authority in Singapore law for the principle that the function of a court in the review of discretionary power depends on whether a jurisdictional or precedent fact was involved . Citing the UK case of Khera v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ; Khawaja v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ( " Khawaja " , 1983 ) . Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin , speaking on behalf of the Court of Appeal , held that the scope of judicial review of an executive decision depends on whether a precedent fact is involved . If the discretion falls outside the precedent fact category , the scope of judicial review is limited to the normal judicial review principles of illegality , irrationality ( that is , Wednesbury unreasonableness ) and procedural impropriety . On the other hand , if one or more precedent facts are involved , the scope of judicial review " extends to deciding whether the evidence justifies the decision " . 
 However , the judge noted that whether a discretionary power is subject to any precedent fact depends on the construction of the legislation creating the power , and that it is open to Parliament to express its intention in plain and unequivocal words to take a discretion conferred on a public authority out of the precedent fact category , thus excluding judicial review of the discretion even if the liberty of a person affected by the exercise of the discretion is implicated . On the facts of the case , the discretion conferred on the President and the Minister for Home Affairs by sections 8 and 10 of the Internal Security Act to detain without trial persons believed to threaten national security , to suspend detentions and to revoke such suspensions , was held to fall outside the precedent fact category . Consequently , the Court could not go beyond determining if the detention decisions violated administrative law rules relating to illegality , irrationality or procedural impropriety . 
 = = = Whether the public authority exercised its discretion wrongly = = = 
 A public authority may have satisfied all the factual and legal conditions required for exercising a statutory power conferred upon it , but nevertheless may have acted illegally by doing so in a manner contrary to administrative law rules . 
 = = = = Bad faith = = = = 
 The act or decision of a public authority is <unk> if it acted in bad faith , that is , it " intentionally abused its power or was reckless as to whether it did so " . Thus , the Singapore Court of Appeal held in Law Society of Singapore v. Tan Guat Neo Phyllis ( 2008 ) that the Attorney @-@ General " may not use his prosecutorial power in bad faith for an extraneous purpose " . The applicant must adduce sufficient evidence to prove bad faith ; mere suspicion is inadequate . The court will consider all the evidence as well as any explanation provided by the respondent , and an inference against the respondent can be drawn if no explanation is given . In the UK context , bad faith is seldom relied on as a ground of review as it is absent in most cases , or difficult to prove . 
 = = = = No evidence and lack of evidence = = = = 
 Another exception to the general rule that courts will generally only judicially review errors of law is where action is taken or a decision is made on the basis of no evidence , a lack of sufficient evidence , or an error of material fact . In such situations , intervention by the High Court is warranted as the action or decision is factually unsustainable . 
 The High Court case of Re Fong Thin Choo ( 1991 ) is authority for the fact that , in Singapore , a public authority 's decision may be challenged on the ground that it is based on no evidence or insufficient evidence . In this case , the Court was asked to inquire into the decision of the Director @-@ General of Customs and Excise to impose customs duty on certain goods that had been imported into the country by the applicant but allegedly not re @-@ exported . In his judgment , Justice Chan Sek Keong endorsed the view of Lord Wilberforce in Secretary of State for Education and Science v. Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council ( 1976 ) that the court was " entitled to inquire into the existence of the facts upon which the evaluation was made " . The test formulated requires the court to ask " whether the [ decision @-@ maker ] could reasonably have come to [ the ] decision on the evidence before [ it ] " . 
 A parallel reference may be made to the key UK case of Coleen Properties Ltd. v. Minister of Housing and Local Government ( 1971 ) . It was held by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales that there was " no material " on which the Minister could have come to his decision to compulsorily acquire the property in question , and thus " the Minister was wrong and [ the ] court should intervene and overrule " . Lord Justice Sachs put forth a higher threshold requirement of " clear and unambiguous evidence " to support the decision made , as compared to the more lenient test of whether there was evidence which would justify a reasonable person in reaching the conclusion which the public authority reached . The latter test may be more in line with that enunciated in Fong Thin Choo , as in that case the crux of judicial intervention hinges on the sufficiency of the evidence to allow the decision @-@ maker to have reached the decision reasonably . 
 Coleen also underlines the larger question of how the ground of insufficiency of evidence relates to , and arguably may be subsumed under , other more established grounds of judicial review . The High Court in Fong Thin Choo drew a link between this ground and that of relevant and irrelevant considerations . Justice Chan held that the " insufficient inquiry " by the Director @-@ General , which satisfied the ground of lack of evidence , constituted a " [ failure ] to take into account relevant considerations " . 
 One criticism levelled against the ground of review is that it has the potential of allowing the court to overstep the scope of its power . Consequently , this erodes " tribunal autonomy " . Since the Fong Thin Choo test recognizes the court 's power to inquire into the evidence upon which the decision was based , this permits the court to examine the merits of the case . This is a departure from the traditional position , where the court restricts itself to assessing the legality of decisions . Nonetheless , it is only where the lack of evidence significantly affects the outcome of the decision that the court is willing to exercise its power of judicial review and intervene on this ground . 
 = = = = Errors of material fact = = = = 
 The High Court in Fong Thin Choo arguably recognized errors of material fact as a ground of review when it endorsed Lord Wilberforce 's remarks in Tameside that if a judgment to be made by a public authority requires the existence of certain facts , the court must determine " whether the judgment has been made upon a proper self @-@ direction as to those facts " , and the court can interfere if the authority has acted " upon an incorrect basis of fact " . In addition , in the judgment of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales in Tameside , Lord Justice Leslie Scarman said that judicial review can be exercised when there has been a " misunderstanding or ignorance of an established and relevant fact " by an authority . 
 In a UK development that has not yet been followed in Singapore , Lord Justice Robert Carnwath held in E v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ( " E v. Home Secretary " , 2004 ) that an error of material fact constitutes " a separate ground of review , based on the principle of fairness " , and laid out four requirements that must be fulfilled to establish it : 
 First , there must have been a mistake as to an existing fact , including a mistake as to the availability of evidence on a particular matter . Secondly , the fact or evidence must have been " established " , in the sense that it was uncontentious and objectively verifiable . Thirdly , the appellant ( or his advisers ) must not have been responsible for the mistake . Fourthly , the mistake must have played a material ( not necessarily decisive ) part in the tribunal 's reasoning . 
 Law professor Paul Craig has taken the view that the effect of E v. Home Secretary is to entitle courts to intervene for all forms of mistake of fact , but that " such a development is not to be welcomed unreservedly , leading as it does to greater court intervention and a corresponding decrease in the autonomy of initial decision @-@ makers " . At the same time , the principles enunciated in E v. Home Secretary do encompass inherent restraints that limit the courts ' scope of intervention . The requirement for the impugned fact or evidence to be " uncontentious and objectively verifiable " is " something that is often not the case in complex judicial review " , and hence may limit potential challenges . 
 = = = = Relevant and irrelevant considerations = = = = 
 The High Court will enquire whether all considerations relevant to an act or decision have been taken into account by the decision @-@ maker , and irrelevant ones ignored . If so , the act or decision stands , subject to other administrative law rules having been complied with . The primary concern of this ground of judicial review is not the merits of the decision itself . Rather , the focus is on the reasoning process by which the decision was reached . However , in the UK context it has been noted that " case law on relevant considerations can sometimes take the courts to the fringes of difficult social and economic choices and that ( arguably ) the courts have not always adopted a position of self @-@ restraint " . 
 The law relating to relevant and irrelevant considerations has developed substantially in the UK . In a dissenting opinion in R. v. Somerset County Council , ex parte Fewings ( 1995 ) , Lord Justice Simon Brown identified three categories of considerations that decision @-@ makers need to be aware of : 
 First , those clearly ( whether expressly or impliedly ) identified by the statute as considerations to which regard must be had . Second , those clearly identified by the statute as considerations to which regard must not be had . Third , those to which the decision @-@ maker may have regard if in his judgment and discretion he thinks it right to do so . 
 The first and third types of consideration may respectively be called mandatory and discretionary relevant considerations . In respect of discretionary relevant considerations , Lord Justice Brown elaborated that there is " a margin of appreciation within which the decision @-@ maker may decide just what considerations should play a part in his reasoning process " , but that this is subject to the principles of Wednesbury unreasonableness . 
 The question of how much weight needs to be placed by the decision @-@ maker on mandatory or discretionary considerations was addressed by the House of Lords in Tesco Stores Ltd. v. Secretary of State for the Environment ( 1995 ) , a case involving planning permission . In his speech , Lord Hoffmann reiterated that the courts are concerned only with the legality of the decision @-@ making process and not with the merits of the decision : 
 The law has always made a clear distinction between the question of whether something is a material consideration and the weight which it should be given . The former is a question of law and the latter is a question of planning judgment , which is entirely a matter for the planning authority . Provided that the planning authority has regard to all material considerations , it is at liberty ( provided that it does not lapse into Wednesbury irrationality ) to give them whatever weight the planning authority thinks fit or no weight at all . The fact that the law regards something as a material consideration therefore involves no view about the part , if any , which it should play in the decision @-@ making process . 
 = = = = = Failing to take into account relevant considerations = = = = = 
 The Singapore case Chew Kia Ngee v. Singapore Society of Accountants ( 1988 ) , though not a judicial review application , illustrates how a decision @-@ maker acts incorrectly if it fails to take into account relevant considerations . The Disciplinary Committee of the Singapore Society of Accountants had found the appellant , an auditor , guilty of an act or default discreditable to an accountant within the meaning of section 33 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the Accountants Act because an incomplete auditor 's report form that he had signed in advance had accidentally been submitted to the Monetary Authority of Singapore . The Committee had ordered that he be suspended from practice for five years . The appellant appealed the decision to the High Court on the basis that the Committee had not taken into account all the relevant considerations of the case in arriving at its decision . The Court concurred , holding that the Committee had not properly considered that the appellant had reviewed the incomplete form with his audit manager and had instructed him how to fill in the rest of it . Therefore , this was not a case of an accountant recklessly signing a blank form without regard to his duties as an auditor . Accordingly , the Court allowed the appeal and set aside the Committee 's order . 
 In the UK , the House of Lords has considered the relevance of the availability of financial resources to a public authority 's decision . In R. v. Gloucestershire County Council , ex parte Barry ( 1997 ) , the court held that it was relevant for Gloucestershire County Council , which had a statutory duty to provide home care services to elderly and frail people , to have considered the cost of doing so when determining whether they should be withdrawn . For instance , Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead said that " needs for services cannot sensibly be assessed without having some regard to the cost of providing them . A person 's need for a particular type or level of service cannot be decided in a vacuum from which all considerations of cost have been expelled . " 
 Barry was distinguished in the subsequent case R. v. East Sussex County Council , ex parte Tandy ( 1998 ) , in which the reduction of home tuition services provided by East Sussex County Council to a young <unk> encephalomyelitis ( chronic fatigue syndrome ) sufferer was challenged . The services were reduced due to a cut in the authority 's home tuition budget . Lord Browne @-@ Wilkinson , speaking for the House of Lords , noted that the statute in question in Barry had required the decision @-@ maker to assess the " needs " of disabled people and whether arranging for home care services to be provided was " necessary in order to meet " those needs . The statute only listed the services that could be provided , and did not define what " needs " meant . Thus , it was " perhaps not surprising " that the court had laid down the availability of resources as a criterion for determining what should be considered " needs " . On the other hand , in Tandy the statute involved imposed on the authority a duty to arrange to provide " suitable education " to the applicant , which was defined according to " wholly objective educational criteria " . Financial resources were not mentioned at all . In the circumstances , the judge held that the extent of the latter was not a consideration relevant to the authority 's decision . He also commented that since it had not been submitted that the authority lacked resources to perform its duty , this was a situation of the authority preferring to spend money on other matters . Thus , the authority could divert funds from discretionary matters and apply them to fulfil its statutory duty . 
 = = = = = Taking into account irrelevant considerations = = = = = 
 The decision of a public authority is subject to judicial review if the authority took into account irrelevant considerations in arriving at its decision . This is demonstrated by Tan <unk> Neo Jessie v. Minister for Finance ( 1991 ) . In this case , the Registrar of Businesses wrote to the applicant to direct her to change the name of her business , " JC Penney Collections " , to one which did not use the name " JC Penney " . At the time , there were two trade marks registered with the Registry of Trade Marks in Singapore under the name " <unk> " . The proprietor of both trade marks was JC Penney Company Inc . , a company incorporated in the United States . These trade marks had not been used in Singapore by the American corporation . The applicant appealed to the Minister for Finance against the decision of the Registrar , but the appeal was dismissed . The applicant subsequently applied for an order of certiorari ( now referred to as a quashing order ) to nullify the decisions of the Registrar and the Minister . 
 The Registrar said that , based on information it had obtained , the applicant had registered the business name with the ulterior motive of riding on the reputation of the American corporation . However , the Court noted that the while the test which the Registrar had applied could not be validly criticized , there was no evidence to support the conclusion that the Registrar had arrived at . At all material times , the American corporation had not carried on any business in Singapore . Neither had its trade mark " <unk> " ever been used in Singapore . It had no reputation in Singapore in relation to its business . As such , it could not be maintained that the applicant , in registering her business under the name " JC Penney Collections " , had any ulterior motive of " riding on the reputation " of the American corporation . The Registrar and the Minister had , among other things , taken into account this irrelevant consideration in coming to their respective decisions to direct the applicant to change her business name and to dismiss her appeal against the direction . Accordingly , the court made an order of certiorari to quash both decisions . 
 = = = = Improper purposes = = = = 
 The basic principle that is applied by the courts is that where statute grants a power to a decision @-@ maker for purpose A , it is unlawful for the decision @-@ maker to exercise the power for purpose B , because the decision @-@ maker would be using the power for an unauthorized purpose . 
 A UK case in which improper purpose as a ground of judicial review was considered was Wheeler v. Leicester City Council ( 1985 ) . Leicester City Council banned a rugby club , Leicester Football Club , from using one of its recreation grounds because some members of the club had taken part in a tournament in South Africa . At that time , the Government of South Africa practised apartheid , and the Council had a policy not to support this . However , the club members who travelled to South Africa , while not agreeing with apartheid , believed that the social barriers created by apartheid could be broken down by maintaining sporting links with the country . The club members had not acted unlawfully by choosing to participate in the tournament , and neither had the club by permitting them to do so . Lord Templeman said that : 
 ... this use by the council of its statutory powers [ to terminate the club 's use of the recreation ground ] was a misuse of power . The council could not properly seek to use its statutory powers of management or any other statutory powers for the purposes of punishing the club when the club had done no wrong . 
 In an earlier , more celebrated case , Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food ( 1968 ) , a group of farmers pressed the Milk Marketing Board to increase the prices for milk payable to them , but the Board refused . The farmers complained to the Minister of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food under section 19 ( 3 ) of the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 . Under the section , the Minister had power to direct that a complaint be considered by the Committee of Investigation but he refused to exercise the statutory power and provided no reasons for his refusal . The farmers alleged misconduct on Minister 's part . The House of Lords held that a minister 's power under an Act is not unfettered , and that the Minister in question had effectively frustrated the objects of the statute as his non @-@ exercise of the power had been based on a misunderstanding of the purpose for which the power was given to him . Parliament must have conferred the discretion with the intention that it should be used to promote the policy and objects of the Act , and the Minister could not act so as to frustrate the policy and objects of the Act . 
 A further example of an executive decision invalidated by improper purpose can be seen from Congreve v. Home Office ( 1976 ) . In that case , the Home Secretary , who had the power to revoke television licences , purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre @-@ empted a rise in licence fees by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up , even though their old licences had not yet expired . The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary 's discretionary powers . His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue , and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose . 
 In the Singapore High Court case of Pillay , the Public Prosecutor appealed against a magistrate 's decision that rules requiring people to pay a fee for a permit before driving motor vehicles into an area of the city designated as the " restricted zone " were ultra vires section 90 ( 1 ) of the Road Traffic Act , the relevant part of which stated : " The Minister may make rules ... generally for the purpose of carrying this Act into effect ... " . The respondent submitted that the primary purpose of the rules was to impose a fee on vehicles entering the restricted zone , and that section 90 ( 1 ) did not empower the Minister to do so . The Court disagreed , holding that the Act empowered the Minister to make rules to regulate road traffic , and the purpose of the rules in question was not fee collection but to alleviate traffic congestion within the restricted zone . The fee imposed was " the means adopted to achieve the desired purpose and is merely incidental thereto " . Law professor Thio Li @-@ ann has commented that the Court 's judgment , which appears to accept that an administrative measure need not relate directly to the purpose of a statute but may be incidental to it , " effectively gives the public body a great latitude to manoeuvre and formulate means which may have only a bare nexus with the statutory purpose " . 
 = = = = = Mixed purposes = = = = = 
 It has been held in the UK that when a public authority exercises a statutory power for a number of purposes , some of which are unlawful , the applicable test for deciding whether the authority acted illegally is whether the unlawful purpose is incidental to the exercise of the power or if the dominant purpose is itself unlawful . If the primary or dominant purpose is the authorized purpose , the administrative action may be held valid . 
 In Westminster Corporation v. London and North Western Railway Co . ( 1905 ) , the appellant had a statutory power to provide public sanitary conveniences and to construct these in , on , or under any road . It built an underground convenience on Parliament Street near Bridge Street in London with access to the pavement on either side of the street . London and North Western Railway Company , which owned property fronting Parliament Street and Bridge Street , objected to the construction . Lord Macnaghten considered whether the Corporation had constructed the subway " as a means of crossing the street under colour and pretence of providing public conveniences which were not really wanted at that particular place " , which would not have been authorized by statute . He concluded that the Corporation 's primary object had been to construct the public conveniences , together with proper means of approaching and exiting from them . Thus , the scheme was not unlawful . 
 = = = = Fettering discretion = = = = 
 It is illegal for a public authority to fetter its own decision @-@ making power , either by adhering too strictly to a policy , or by making a decision on the basis of another person 's decision or delegating the responsibility of the decision @-@ making process to another person . 
 = = = = = Application of a rigid policy = = = = = 
 An authority 's discretion is fettered when it adheres strictly or rigidly to policy guidelines . The general rule is that anyone who has to exercise a statutory discretion must not " shut his ears to an application " . However , if limits are placed on the exercise of discretion , this does not necessarily mean that the authority 's decision is fettered . In Lines International Holding ( S ) Pte . Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board ( 1997 ) , one of the issues before the Singapore High Court was whether the Port of Singapore Authority ( PSA ) had fettered its discretion by applying a guideline of not allocating berths at the Singapore Cruise Centre to cruise ships unless over a three @-@ month period 30 % or fewer of the cruises in a cruise operator 's schedule consisted of " cruises @-@ to @-@ nowhere " . Such cruises , which left Singapore 's territorial waters and returned to Singapore without calling at any other destination port , tended to be mainly for gambling purposes . 
 The Court held that a body exercising administrative discretion is entitled to adopt a general policy to guide it in exercising its statutory duties and powers without having to pass regulations or by @-@ laws , provided that the following requirements are met : 
 The policy is not Wednesbury @-@ unreasonable . In assessing whether policies fall foul of this rule , a court cannot reject the way in which an administrative body formulated a policy in favour of its own view of how the discretion should have been exercised . Furthermore , a policy is not Wednesbury @-@ unreasonable if the court simply feels that it may not work effectively . 
 The policy is made known to affected persons . 
 The administrative body is " prepared to hear out individual cases or is prepared to deal with exceptional cases " . 
 The Court ruled that the first two requirements had been satisfied , and that the guideline had not been rigidly enforced because the PSA had been willing to consider representations from cruise operators like the plaintiff , and , if the circumstances required , the PSA had been willing to grant an exception to the 30 % restriction rule . Moreover , a number of concessions had in fact been made by the PSA . 
 = = = = = Acting under dictation and improperly delegating power = = = = = 
 A public authority is not permitted to base its decision upon another person 's instruction , or to ask someone to decide on its behalf . In Lines International , the plaintiff alleged that the PSA had fettered its discretion by acting under dictation since one of the conditions for the allocation of berths was the following : 
 The Port of Singapore Authority will refuse allocation of berth to a vessel if the Gambling Suppression Branch , CID [ Criminal Investigation Department ] and Singapore Tourist Promotion Board so [ sic ] determine that such action is necessary . 
 The High Court agreed with the plaintiff that since the PSA had authority to decide how to allocate berths , it was also entrusted with the duty to exercise that discretion after taking various key factors into consideration , and would have acted unlawfully if it had abrogated its responsibility by taking orders from other public authorities such as the Gambling Suppression Branch or the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board unless it was under a statutory duty to do so . However , on the facts of the case , the decision to deny berths to the plaintiff 's cruise ship had been taken by the PSA alone . 
 The legal principle laid down in Lines International was approved by the Court of Appeal in Registrar of Vehicles v. Komoco Motors Pte . Ltd . ( 2008 ) , but found not to apply on the facts . The relevant issue was whether the Registrar of Vehicles , in order to determine the " additional registration fee " ( " ARF " ) payable on motor vehicles by importers , had fettered her discretion by adopting the " open market value " ( " OMV " ) which the Singapore Customs assigned to such vehicles . The Court held that by adopting this practice , the Registrar had not taken instructions from the Customs as she was permitted by rule 7 ( 3 ) of the Road Traffic ( Motor Vehicles , Registration and Licensing ) Rules to exercise discretion to determine the value of motor vehicles by relying on the Customs ' OMVs . Furthermore , unlike the situation in Lines International where PSA had to exercise judgment in weighing up various factors to determine whether a cruise ship should be allocated berthing space , once the Registrar had decided to adopt the Customs ' OMVs , the <unk> were determined by applying a mathematical formula . The Registrar neither needed to exercise any further discretion , nor take instructions from any public authority such as the Customs . 
 = = = = Substantive legitimate expectation = = = = 
 Under UK law , a public authority may be prevented from going back on a lawful representation that an individual will receive or continue to receive a substantive benefit of some kind , even if he or she does not have a legal right to the benefit , because the representation gives rise to a legitimate expectation . That expectation may arise from a promise made by the authority , or from a consistent past practice . As the expectation must be a " reasonable " one , a person 's own conduct may deprive him or her of any expectations he or she may have of legitimacy . The courts take three practical questions into consideration in determining whether to give effect to an applicant 's legitimate interest : 
 whether a legitimate expectation has arisen as a result of a public body 's representation ; 
 whether it is unlawful for the public body to frustrate the legitimate expectation ; and 
 if so , what the appropriate remedy is . 
 As regards the first question , in Borissik v. Urban Redevelopment Authority ( 2009 ) , the Singapore High Court adopted four conditions set out in De Smith 's Judicial Review ( 6th ed . , 2007 ) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created . The public body 's representation must be clear , unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification ; induced by the conduct of the decision @-@ maker ; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority ; and applicable to the applicant , who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply . 
 As regards the second question , in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority , ex parte Coughlan ( 1999 ) , the Court of Appeal of England and Wales identified three categories of legitimate expectations . Category ( b ) involves procedural legitimate expectations , and so are not discussed here because breaches of them are a form of procedural impropriety rather than illegality . Categories ( a ) and ( c ) relate to substantive legitimate expectations . Category ( a ) cases are those which lie " in what may inelegantly be called the macro @-@ political field " . The public authority " is only required to bear in mind its previous policy or other representation , giving it the weight it thinks right , but no more , before deciding whether to change course " , and the court may only review the authority 's decision on the ground of Wednesbury unreasonableness . On the other hand , category ( c ) cases are usually those " where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people , giving the promise or representation the character of a contract " . When assessing such a case , the court decides whether for a public authority to frustrate an expectation is so unfair that it amounts to an abuse of power . The court must weigh the requirements of fairness towards the individual against any overriding interests relied by the authorities to justify the change of policy . A slightly different approach has been adopted by Lord Justice John Laws . In R. v. Secretary of State for Education and Employment , ex parte Begbie ( 1999 ) , he suggested that the Coughlan categories are not " hermetically sealed " , and in Nadarajah v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ( 2005 ) , he expanded on this by taking a proportionality approach : 
 [ A ] public body 's promise or practice as to future conduct may only be denied ... in circumstances where to do so is the public body 's legal duty , or is otherwise ... a proportionate response ( of which the court is the judge , or the last judge ) having regard to a legitimate aim pursued by the public body in the public interest . 
 Where the third question is concerned , where a person convinces the court that his or her substantive legitimate expectation has been frustrated , the usual remedy is for the court to order that the public authority fulfil the expectation . However , in R. ( Bibi ) v. Newham London Borough Council ( 2001 ) it was held that when the decision in question is " informed by social and political value judgments as to priorities of expenditure " it is more appropriate for the authority to make the decision , and the court may order that the authority should merely reconsider its decision , taking into account the person 's substantive legitimate expectation . 
 The doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation has not yet been explicitly acknowledged as part of Singapore law . In Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor ( 1997 ) , the Singapore Court of Appeal had to decide whether life imprisonment in the Penal Code meant imprisonment for 20 years , which was the prevailing understanding , or whether it meant imprisonment for the remaining period of the convicted person 's natural life . The Court concluded that the latter interpretation was correct , but overruled the former interpretation prospectively such that it only took effect from the date of the judgment and did not apply to the appellant . One of the reasons the Court relied on for doing so was the administrative law doctrine of legitimate expectation . It recognized that " certain legitimate expectations could , in certain circumstances , be deserving of protection , even though they did not acquire the force of a legal right " . Since for many years life imprisonment had been reckoned as 20 years ' incarceration , this had given rise to a legitimate expectation according to which individuals had arranged their affairs . Thus , the Court ought to give effect to the expectation by prospectively overruling the prior interpretation . Nonetheless , the Court stated : " [ W ] e were not concerned with judicial review , nor were we deciding whether any claim of a legitimate expectation could <unk> the Prisons Department in future from applying the interpretation which we gave to life imprisonment . That was a separate matter which was not under consideration here . " 
 In Borissik , the applicant and her husband were joint owners of a semi @-@ detached house with a plot size of around 419 square metres ( 4 @,@ 510 sq ft ) which was attached to another semi @-@ detached house with a plot size of around 244 @.@ 5 square metres ( 2 @,@ 632 sq ft ) . In 2002 , the Urban Redevelopment Authority ( URA ) revised its guidelines for the redevelopment of semi @-@ detached houses , now permitting a semi @-@ detached house to be converted to a detached house if and only if both the semi @-@ detached plot and its adjoining semi @-@ detached plot each had a size of at least 400 square metres ( 4 @,@ 300 sq ft ) . On the basis of this guideline , the URA rejected the application submitted by the applicant and her husband to demolish their semi @-@ detached house and replace it with a detached house . Dissatisfied , the applicant applied for a mandatory order for approval to be granted . One of her arguments was that she had a legitimate expectation that her proposal would be approved on the basis of the old guidelines ; in other words , she sought fulfilment of a substantive legitimate expectation . In the end , the High Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her . She could neither show that any person with actual or ostensible authority had made any promise to her , nor that the URA 's officers had acted in a way to lead her to have a legitimate expectation that her redevelopment plans would be approved . Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong has cautioned against reading the case as an implicit acknowledgement that legitimate expectations can be substantively enforced . He noted that " there is good reason for judges in Singapore to tread carefully , stepping gingerly on each stone in crossing the river " . 
 In UDL Marine ( Singapore ) Pte . Ltd. v. Jurong Town Corp. ( 2011 ) , the High Court " entertain [ ed ] some doubt " as to whether the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation is part of Singapore law , but did not discuss the matter further as neither the respondent nor the Attorney @-@ General had made submissions on the issue .

 = Mirrors ( Natalia Kills song ) = 
 " Mirrors " is a song by the English recording artist Natalia Kills from her debut studio album , Perfectionist ( 2011 ) . It was released by Cherrytree Records on 10 August 2010 as the lead single from the album . The track was written and produced by Akon , Giorgio Tuinfort and Martin " Cherry Cherry Boom Boom " Kierszenbaum , with additional writing from Kills . Described as a " disco pop " song , " Mirrors " contains references to various themes including sexual sadomasochism and arrogance . 
 Critical response to " Mirrors " was generally positive — most music critics denoted it as a standout from Perfectionist . The track received chart success in some countries of Europe , reaching the top ten of Austria , Germany , and Poland . On the US Hot Dance Club Songs , it peaked at number three , whereas in the United Kingdom , it failed to reach the top 100 . The music video for " Mirrors " was directed by Guillaume Doubet , and follows Kills exploring the concepts of vanity , control and sex after being mysteriously dragged into a mirror . She further promoted the song with live performances on the 2011 Life Ball and on the German programme Schlag den Raab .

 " Mirrors " was recorded at the 11th Street Studios , Chalice Recording Studios and Cherrytree Recording Studios . It was co @-@ produced and co @-@ written by Akon , Giorgio Tuinfort , and Martin " Cherry Cherry Boom Boom " Kierszenbaum ; the latter two also recorded instruments for the song . Kills provided additional songwriting . Mark " Exit " Goodchild and Tony Ugyal engineered it , while post @-@ production was helmed by Robert Orton and Gene Grimaldi . The former mixed the track , while the latter mastered it . 
 " Mirrors " has been described as a " disco pop " song which features electric guitars , a bassline and a " grinding synthesised beat " and that the track " fuses bubbling ' 80s synth pop basslines , stadium rock guitars , and an anthemic falsetto chorus " . Jack Stevin of AltSounds commented that the track 's instrumentation provides it with a " gothic feel " . AllMusic 's Jon O 'Brien and AOL Radio writer Matthew Wilkening likened the song to " Sweet Dreams ( Are Made of This ) " by Eurythmics — the former credited " Mirrors " ' beat with the similarity , while the latter compared it to an " all fueled @-@ up on Red Bull and steroids " version of the Eurythmics track . Kills hits a falsetto note on the chorus , where she sings , " Turning the lights out / Burning the candles / And the mirrors gonna fog tonight " . The song 's lyrics reference sadomasochist sexual practices , with Kills incorporating a dominatrix @-@ inspired persona . Consequence of Sound 's Alex Young interpreted the lyrical content as discussing " duplicity of identity , hubris , and objectification " , which he also called " more relatable " than the themes <unk> in Perfectionist .

 Upon release , " Mirrors " received generally positive reviews from music critics . Writing for Consequence of Sound , Alex Young highlighted the song as an " essential track " from Perfectionist , while AllMusic 's Jon O 'Brien also denoted it as a standout from the album , calling it " pretty stellar " . Lewis Corner of Digital Spy similarly praised the song , giving it a four out of five stars rating . Blair Kelly from musicOMH described the song 's chorus as " great , and very catchy " ; conversely , she criticized the song 's talked part . AltSounds ' Jack Stevin opined that the song was " enjoyable " , in spite of " uninspiring lyrics " . 
 The song achieved high positions on some European charts . On the Ö3 Austria Top 40 , it spent 20 weeks and peaked at number 7 ; the track was listed fiftieth on Austria 's 2011 year @-@ end chart . " Mirrors " reached number 10 on the Media Control German single chart , and was 2011 's 80th most successful single in the country . The song reached its highest peak of number two on the Polish Airplay Top 20 , for the week ending 15 April 2011 ; in contrast , the song entered the United Kingdom chart at number 101 . In Switzerland , " Mirrors " spent one week , peaking at number 52 , whereas in Flanders , it didn 't manage to enter the main Ultratop chart and instead entered the secondary Ultratip , at number 18 . In North America , the single attained limited success — it reached number 35 on the Canadian Hot 100 , and peaked at number 3 on the US Hot Dance Club Songs .

 The French director Guillaume Doubet was commissioned to direct the video for " Mirrors " , which was released on 2 December 2010 . Idolator 's Robbie Daw described it as " creepy " and " cinematic " , and praised Kills ' clothing . 
 The video begins with Kills applying red lipstick , in a car mirror , while the instrumental of the song plays . She leaves the car and passes by a man , who is afterwards seen standing between two women wearing plastic masks of Kills ' face . The music mutes and the sound of footsteps is heard repeatedly as Kills approaches a cracked mirror . After hearing a noise behind her , she looks over her shoulder as her reflection looks to her as well . Kills is dragged into the mirror , and the title card of the first act , " Vanity " . During the section , a metal skull is shown while Kills lip @-@ synchs the song in front of a mirror . The visual transitions to its second act , dubbed " Control " , in which she holds an axe while standing on top of a glass box . A man is seen inside the box , filming her as she moves around it . The video then shifts to act three , named " Sex " , in which Kill is depicted singing to a skull . Towards the end of the video , Kills is seen handcuffed and chained while sitting on the floor , and seducing a blindfolded man .

 = Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 = 
 The Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 ( 7 Edw . 7 , <unk> ) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that reformed the auxiliary forces of the British Army by transferring existing Volunteer and Yeomanry units into a new Territorial Force ( TF ) ; and disbanding the Militia to form a new Special Reserve of the Regular Army . This reorganisation formed a major part of the Haldane Reforms , named after the creator of the Act , Richard Haldane . 
 The lessons learned during the South African War of 1899 @-@ 1902 had reinforced the idea that the regular Army was not capable of fighting a prolonged full @-@ scale war without significant assistance ; almost all regular units in the United Kingdom had been deployed overseas within four months of the outbreak of hostilities , and the entire pool of reserve manpower had been exhausted in under a year . There had been no thought before the war to using auxiliary forces overseas ; in the event , volunteers had been used on an ad @-@ hoc basis , and a new auxiliary arm ( the Imperial Yeomanry ) was formed to provide specialist troops , but it was clear that a more effective system was required in future . A number of attempts at reform under the Conservative government of 1901 @-@ 1905 had failed to make any lasting changes to the system , and left the auxiliary forces disorganised and demoralised . 
 With the Liberal victory in December 1905 , Haldane was appointed as Secretary of State for War , and immediately set about reforming the Army to best prepare it for an intervention in a European war . He decided on a regular Expeditionary Force and an auxiliary " Territorial Force " , which would be liable for home defence , with an expanded reserve for the Regular Army . After some examination of the best way to implement this , Haldane put forward a draft bill in the winter of 1906 , and ensured it would be in the government 's legislative program for the coming year . In order to ensure it would pass without difficulty , he consulted privately with senior Army officers and the King , as well as the leader of the Opposition , to gain their support for the principles of the legislation . It was put before the Commons on 4 March , then debated in late March and throughout April , where it received prolific but disorganised opposition , mainly from partisans of the existing system . A small group opposed the bill on the grounds that the proposed force would be ineffective against Continental armies , whilst the Labour Party members generally opposed any increase in military strength . It had its third reading in June , passing with a comfortable majority , and received the Royal Assent in August ; the Act became effective immediately , though the bulk of its reforms were scheduled to begin on 1 April 1908 . 
 The Act was divided into three main sections ; the first created " County Associations " , which would be the local bodies which would administer and support the Territorial units - they would , however , have no military control over them when called out for service . The second section reformed the existing Volunteers and Yeomanry into the newly created Territorial Force , whilst the third dissolved the Militia and in its place created the Special Reserve , to be composed of men who had not previously served in the regular Army . 
 = = Background and the need for reform = = 
 In 1899 , with the outbreak of the South African War , the British Army was committed to its first large @-@ scale overseas deployment since the 1850s . The intervening period had seen extensive redevelopments of the Regular Army . The Cardwell Reforms of 1868 – 1872 had abolished the purchase of commissions , professionalising the officer corps , and reformed the system of enlistment so that recruits now served for six years with the colours and then a further six years liable for reserve service . The new reserve system had been tested in the 1882 Anglo @-@ Egyptian War ( when reservists fought overseas for the first time ) and during the <unk> Crisis , when the reserves of one cavalry regiment and fifteen infantry regiments , totalling 4 @,@ 681 men , were mobilised . 
 The administrative structure of the Army had been further reinforced by the creation of regimental districts , where regular infantry regiments were paired together to share a depot and linked to the local militia and volunteer units . In the early 1880s , the next step was taken by the Childers Reforms , which formally amalgamated the regiments into a single two @-@ battalion unit along with the militia and volunteers . This meant that , in general , one battalion of each infantry regiment was based at home with its depot and one was based overseas , which meant that roughly half the Regular Army was available in the United Kingdom for responding to any new overseas commitments . It was estimated , by the " Stanhope Memorandum " of 1891 , that a mobilisation of the whole Army would provide two full Army Corps of regular troops — with units reinforced individually by reservists — and a third composed partly of Regulars and partly of Militia , with the remaining auxiliary forces used for garrisons in fixed defences at the ports and around London . 
 = = = Status of the auxiliary forces in 1899 = = = 
 The regular units were supported by their own reserves , discussed above , and three " auxiliary forces " — the Militia , the Yeomanry , and the Volunteers . In the Militia , which was administered by the Regular Army , recruits drilled for six weeks on joining , and for one month a year thereafter , a period of time which was suited well to casual labourers or agricultural workers but was impractical for urban workers or skilled tradesmen . Thirty to forty percent of recruits were young men who passed into the Regular Army , and only twenty percent served their full six @-@ year service . All militiamen over 19 could join the Militia Reserve , accepting the liability to serve overseas with the regular army in case of war if called on to do so : in 1898 , this reserve exceeded its establishment of 30 @,@ 000 by 1 @,@ 049 men . The force came to 123 battalions of infantry , 32 brigades of coastal artillery , and little else ; there was a small group of fortress engineers and a medical staff of about 600 men , but no service arms . If the members of a battalion volunteered for overseas service it could be sent overseas as a unit — several had done during the Crimean War , serving as colonial garrisons — but the Militia as a whole was effectively little more than a collection of independent units and not a serviceable home defence force . 
 The second element of the auxiliary forces was the Yeomanry , 38 regiments of volunteer cavalry which had historically been used as a form of internal security police , deployed to suppress local riots and provide a show of force to support the authorities . Recruits to the force were usually personally wealthy , providing their own horses and uniforms , and units were often heavily bankrolled by their senior officers . Training requirements were low , with an annual eight @-@ day camp . The regiments were liable to be called out for defence against an invasion or an insurrection , and were not prepared for effective mobilisation ; the units possessed no transport resources , or even a designated quartermaster . 
 The third arm was the Volunteers , mainly drawn from small businessmen , artisans , and professionals ; they were predominantly urban middle @-@ class units , training at weekends and with no annual camp . There were 213 rifle corps and 66 corps of artillery , though the latter were mostly coastal artillery or static " position batteries " equipped with unwieldy 40 @-@ pounder guns , and they did not constitute an organised field force . There were some engineer and medical units , but no service corps . The status of the volunteer units was further complicated by their origins as private societies ; they received some central funding , but were mostly supported by local subscriptions and the generosity of their commanders . 
 = = = Effects of the South African War = = = 
 The reforms had ensured that a sizable force of regular troops was based in the United Kingdom for service as an expeditionary force , over and above the troops already stationed overseas . However , once the decision was taken to send a corps @-@ size field force to fight in the South African War , the system began to show a strain . Three divisions were earmarked for deployment in October 1899 , and 25 @,@ 000 men were mobilised from the reserve to reinforce them ; however , regulations of the time held that men under twenty should not be sent overseas , so the reservists had to replace underage or otherwise ineffective soldiers as well as filling the existing gaps . In some units , this meant reservists made up over 50 % of the battalion strength ; throughout the force , 36 @.@ 5 % of men were listed as unfit for foreign service . When the force sailed , 20 @,@ 000 of the 47 @,@ 000 men were reservists The field force , augmented by an additional brigade of infantry at the last minute , totalled three divisions ; a fourth was organised in early November , and a fifth at the end of the month . A sixth was mobilised on 14 December , which completed the two corps originally planned as an expeditionary force , and after a brief panic in mid @-@ December a seventh was dispatched at the end of January , leaving the country virtually empty of regular troops . 
 This was the end of the planned mobilisation ; no thought had been given pre @-@ war to mobilising the Militia , Yeomanry or Volunteers as formed units for foreign service . 43 @,@ 000 reservists had been sent overseas with the regular forces — out of a total of 80 @,@ 000 — with the remainder sent overseas as reinforcements and replacements over the first year of the war . The conventional system of posting reservists to their own regiment worked until April 1900 , after which it became sometimes necessary to post reservists to different regiments due to heavy losses , and by September 1900 this system had broken down entirely , with the reserves entirely exhausted of men . 
 On 16 December , the first request was sent from South Africa for auxiliary troops , and a commitment was made to send a " considerable force of militia and picked yeomanry and volunteers " . In early January , the reinforcements to be sent out included one service company of volunteers for each regular battalion , one complete volunteer battalion , and seven militia battalions . A large number of battalions of the Militia , which had volunteered for overseas service , were eventually sent out of the country during the war ; sixty , with around 46 @,@ 000 men , went to South Africa , whilst eight more served in colonial garrisons . They were employed mainly on lines of communication , and regarded as second @-@ line troops of low quality ; this was unsurprising , as they were strongly deficient in officers and heavily composed of men of 18 and 19 , who would have been regarded as too young by the regular Army . The deficiencies of the militia were increased by the fact that many of its best and most experienced men had volunteered for the Militia Reserve : Of the 30 @,@ 000 @-@ strong militia reserve , 13 @,@ 000 were stripped from their battalions and sent overseas as drafts for regular units , while some of the 10 @,@ 000 who had already travelled to South Africa with the militia were subsequently transferred to regular units while overseas . Sir Ian Hamilton commented that " the men from the Militia Reserve who were in regular battalions were quite excellent ... Every commanding officer I asked about them said they were first class men . The Militia battalions that had come out , had lost many of their officers , who had gone to regular battalions to replace losses in the earlier part of the war . They had also been somewhat short of officers to start with ... that [ line of communication service ] was what they were best suited for under the circumstances . " 
 The first Volunteer unit to be sent out was a composite battalion recruited from the London units , the City Imperial Volunteers , raised in early January 1900 ; it was sent into combat after six weeks of training in South Africa , where Lord Roberts described it as " quite excellent " , and was returned home in October . At the same time , a number of service companies were raised from the volunteer units , organised by the regimental depots from the volunteer units in the district rather than by the volunteer units themselves . They were employed as integral companies of the regular battalions , and were well regarded in the field . The Yeomanry , likewise , were not employed as complete units . Whilst the initial request for auxiliaries had called for " 8 @,@ 000 irregulars ... organised in companies of 100 " and specified that they should be equipped as mounted infantry , the Yeomanry had always been trained and equipped as shock cavalry , with sabres , carbines and lances . The decision was taken in late December to form a new force , the Imperial Yeomanry , to consist of mounted infantry organised separately from the existing Yeomanry . Whilst the Yeomanry provided many of the officers and NCOs , only a small number of recruits came from existing Yeomanry regiments , with some more from Volunteer corps ; most were drawn from civilians who had not previously been members of either . The units performed well , but recruiting proceeded in fits and starts — recruitment stopped in May , and was only resumed in early 1901 — and so an adequate supply of manpower was not always available . 
 = = = Conservative reforms = = = 
 After the " khaki election " of October 1900 , the Conservative Party remained in power , but instituted a thorough reorganisation of the government . The War Office was now led by St. John Brodrick , who immediately called for extensive reform . In the debate on the Army Estimates on 8 March 1901 , he dismissed a two @-@ corps expeditionary force as insufficient , and suggested that " ... besides Home Defence we ought to be ready at any moment to send abroad three Army Corps with the proper Cavalry Division ... 120 @,@ 000 men " . He proposed to divide the nation into six geographical corps districts , each of which would contain the appropriate units during peacetime which it would command in war . The First and Second Corps , of regulars , would be based at Aldershot and Salisbury Plain ; a Third Corps , mostly regulars , would be based in Ireland . These three would constitute the force for overseas service . The Fourth , Fifth and Sixth Corps would be composed of a mixture of regular and auxiliary forces , with sixty selected " first @-@ line " Volunteer and Militia battalions . The remaining auxiliary forces would be assigned for defensive purposes to whichever corps they were located under . The Yeomanry , meanwhile , would be heavily expanded and reformed as Imperial Yeomanry , the mounted infantry having proved of great use in South Africa . This scheme could of course not be implemented whilst the South African War was in progress , but even in peacetime it was slow to take effect ; in March 1903 a report gave the Fifth and Sixth Corps as " not yet formed " , large numbers of the component units for other corps were unavailable , not yet organised , or simply quartered in the wrong locations , and perhaps most remarkably , the First Corps had no brigadiers to command it — they were to be assigned on mobilisation . 
 Shortly thereafter , Hugh Arnold @-@ Forster was appointed Secretary of State for War . One of his first acts was to appoint Lord Esher to chair a committee on War Office reform ; this would culminate in the Esher Report of 1904 , which called for a number of administrative reforms , including the formation of the Army Council . In the summer of 1904 , the Norfolk Commission , which had been set up to consider the existing state of the Militia and Volunteers , issued its report . It advocated a form of compulsory service — which was swiftly rejected by the Government — but also offered various more pragmatic reforms which were later taken up as part of the Haldane Reforms . The state of the Militia was reported as " unfit to take the field " , and the Volunteer Force was " not qualified .. against a Regular Army " . For the time being , however , Arnold @-@ Forster pressed ahead with his reforms , proposing on 14 July 1904 — to strong opposition — that the Regular Army be split into a General Service Army ( liable for peacetime service at home and overseas ) and a Home Service Army ( for peacetime service at home , and able to be sent overseas in time of crisis ) . The Militia was not discussed in the proposals , but he undertook to reduce the strength of the Volunteers and split them into first and second @-@ class units . When the debate resumed in the 1905 session , Parliament having been adjourned shortly after the original announcement , it continued to be attacked , and very little progress was made in implementing it ; an attempt in June 1905 to confidentially identify Volunteer units likely to be disbanded was reported by the Daily Chronicle , and questions were asked in both Houses of Parliament . Arnold @-@ Forster was forced to back down , suggesting that he only wished to determine what proportion of the Volunteers were capable of foreign service . 
 By the end of this period , the constant attempts at reorganisation had proved a mixed bag , particularly for the auxiliary forces . The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised , whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling off and the financial situation of the units was becoming worrying . The system of central per @-@ capita grants helped support the units , despite the worrying side @-@ effect of causing an incentive to keep as many men on the books as possible regardless of fitness , but even so it was becoming apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action were taken . 
 = = = Haldane at the War Office = = = 
 In December 1905 , the Balfour government collapsed , and Sir Henry Campbell @-@ Bannerman became Prime Minister , leading a minority Liberal government . Richard Haldane was appointed Secretary of State for War , an almost accidental selection — he himself had been aiming to be Lord Chancellor , whilst Campbell @-@ Bannerman offered him the post of Attorney @-@ General , then the Home Office , and had offered the War Office to two other men before Haldane offered to take it . Despite this inauspicious beginning , he would become — in the words of Douglas Haig — " the greatest Secretary of State for War England has ever had " . Haldane took the post with no preconceived ideas as to the role of the Army , but quickly settled on the idea that efficiency was essential as a precursor to making financial economies . After a brief hiatus during the 1906 general election , which the Liberals won comfortably , Haldane turned his attention to the Tangier Crisis , which had almost brought France and Germany to war in December . Sir Edward Grey , the Foreign Secretary , had privately agreed to commit the Army to the aid of France , if attacked , and Haldane began to consider how best to accomplish this . He quickly concluded that there was a need for a regular Expeditionary Force , specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force . 
 The question now became how to provide this force , and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six twelve @-@ battalion infantry divisions with supporting arms . They would need to be organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom , as they would be committed into action as soon as they reached the Continent . Because the Army was now geared to a specific purpose , it could be reorganised to fit this role , and any elements which did not support it could be discarded . These reforms anticipated that the existing tripartite division of the Army — the Regular Army , the Volunteers / Yeomanry and the Militia — should be changed into a two @-@ part structure , with an Expeditionary Force and a home @-@ defence Territorial Force based on County Associations . The Volunteers and Yeomanry would form the basis for the Territorial Force , whilst the Militia would be used as a reserve for the all @-@ Regular Expeditionary Force , fully liable for service overseas . 
 He formed a committee — the " Territorial Force Committee " , sometimes known as the " Esher Committee " after its chair Lord Esher — of 45 representatives from the Regular Army , the Militia , the Volunteers and the War Office to study the proposals and attempt to reach an agreement . The Committee first met on 22 May and sat until July . It failed to reach any effective conclusion , mostly stalling on the issue of what to do with the Militia — should it be merged with the Volunteers , or should it be formally incorporated into the Regular Army ? A secondary problem was the desire of the commanders of individual volunteer units who wished to retain the greater independence their units currently possessed , rather than placing themselves under the control of other bodies . 
 A second attempt to gain the agreement of Militia colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June , and was strongly opposed . All fourteen of the Militia representatives insisted that overseas service should be done by complete Militia battalions , rather than drafts sent to regular battalions . A third meeting , in October , proposed that the Militia join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force ; this , too , was rejected . As both possible approaches for dealing with the Militia had been strongly opposed , the decision was taken to do away with it entirely and replace it with a newly created force , the Special Reserve , which would incorporate those elements of the Militia willing to be transferred . 
 = = Legislative history = = 
 The Act was drafted by Haldane , in the winter of 1906 , with the assistance of John Kemp and Frederick Liddell and the support of Douglas Haig . A final draft was sent to the King on 12 January and all that remained was to ensure its passage through the House of Commons . He was confident of the support of the Prime Minister , and privately discussed the bill with Arthur Balfour , the Leader of the Opposition , in order to ensure there would not be significant Conservative Party opposition . At the time , the governing Liberal Party was mostly absorbed with problems of social reform , and it was not guaranteed that there would be time to present a defence bill . At the beginning of the year , however , Haldane discovered that a bill scheduled for the session was not yet ready , and offered " a small Bill of his own which might conveniently fill the gap " . 
 On 25 February Haldane introduced the new Army Estimates , which showed a saving of slightly over two million pounds , and discussed the forthcoming reforms , stating that the critical problem was to ensure continued recruitment for line regiments from the Militia and to provide financial support for the stability of the Volunteer units . A memorandum issued on the same day expanded on these points , and suggested that in the event of a future war , with the Expeditionary Force sent abroad , the Territorial Force would be mobilised as an organisation for " support and expansion " , and after six months ' training and home defence duties , would be able to volunteer for overseas service . 
 The bill itself was formally introduced to the House of Commons on 4 March 1907 . The subject was debated in the House of Lords on 21 March , where the proposed changed to the Militia were strongly opposed . The bill had its second reading in the Commons on 9 , 10 , and 23 April , and was passed into Committee , where it was discussed at some length over nine days . The opposition to the bill , whilst verbose , was not very effective . Hugh Arnold @-@ Forster , the previous War Secretary , argued that the Territorial Force would prove ineffective in opposition to conscripted Continental armies , whilst the Labour Party objected generally to any increase in military strength . Most of the opposition came from partisans of the existing system ; as well as the implacable opposition from the Militia element , supporters of the Yeomanry objected to the reduction in their daily rates ( from 5s . 6d. to 2s . 8d . ) , whilst Sir Howard Vincent led the opposition from the Volunteers against the stricter control of the new regulations . However , the strong Liberal majority saw off all opposition , and the bill moved for a third reading on 19 June , where it passed with 286 votes to 63 . The opposition was mainly led by the Irish MPs , who voted against the government for reasons unrelated to the bill , and some of the Labour Party ; most of the Unionists , save a few like Vincent or Charles Dilke , abstained rather than oppose . 
 The bill then passed to a third reading in the House of Lords , where it took a few minor amendments , but escaped any significant opposition barring a brief dispute over the status of Cadet units ; it was eventually agreed that they could be supported by the associations provided that no funding was to be provided from money voted by Parliament . This amendment was accepted by the Government , and the bill passed smoothly to royal assent . 
 = = Provisions of the Act = = 
 The Act had four sections . Part I established the County Associations , who would administer the system , whilst Part II covered the formation of the Territorial Force from existing units of volunteers and yeomanry . Part III created the Special Reserve and arranged for the transfer of Militia units , and Part IV contained miscellaneous other provisions as well as the related schedules . 
 = = = Part I — County Associations = = = 
 Part I authorised the establishment of County Associations under schemes to be drawn up by the Army Council , and laid out the expected form of these associations and their areas of authority . It provided that they were to be funded centrally but could raise funds in their own right , and that any other regulations necessary for the administration of the associations were to be made by the Army Council . It explicitly stipulated that these associations were not to have operational command over the forces they administered . 
 = = = = Organisation of Associations = = = = 
 Section 1 of the Act stipulated that the County Associations would be responsible for " ... the reorganisation under this Act of His Majesty 's military forces other than the regulars and their reserves , and of the administration of those forces when so reorganised " . The Army Council would draw up an organising scheme for every County Association , which would define its membership and name . These schemes were to be approved by Parliament . 
 The Act anticipated that such schemes would have the lord lieutenant of the county as the president , and required at least half of the membership would consist of officers drawn from all branches of the Territorial Force ( or , preceding that , the Yeomanry and Volunteers ) . " Where desirable " , members were also to include representatives of the county councils , county borough councils , and universities within the area of the Association , as well as co @-@ opted members representative " of the interests of employers and workmen " . The scheme would also lay down general administrative issues , such as the appointment of an initial chairman and officers and the rules of procedure . The schemes could permit general officers ( or their deputies ) to attend the meetings and speak , but not vote . 
 Each association was to cover a single county ( corresponding to the lieutenancy counties created by the Local Government Act 1888 , Local Government ( Scotland ) Act 1889 and Local Government ( Ireland ) Act 1898 ) . Where the county was sufficiently large , the scheme could divide it into multiple parts and assign these to sub @-@ associations . 
 = = = = Duties of Associations = = = = 
 The Section 2 of the Act provided the duties of County Associations . They were primarily constituted to organise the Territorial Force within their county , but it was explicitly stipulated that they " shall not have any powers of training over any part of His Majesty 's military forces " . The Act permitted that virtually any relevant duties of the Crown could be assigned to the Associations , but particularly noted : 
 Organisation and administration of Territorial Force units , except when called out for training or military service . 
 Recruiting of the Force both in peacetime and wartime . 
 Provision and maintenance of rifle ranges , buildings , magazines and sites of camps , the organisation of areas for manoeuvres , and secure storage for weapons and equipment . 
 Arrangement with employers of holidays for training , and the timings of training camps . 
 Establishment and support of cadet battalions and rifle clubs , with the caveat that no funding could be provided out of the Parliamentary grant in respect of any person under the age of sixteen . This caveat was a compromise introduced on the third reading of the bill ; the Commons had provided that no support could be given for a person under sixteen at all , and the Lords wished to remove this restriction . The compromise was to state that no support could come from Parliamentary funds , but the associations were effectively free to raise money themselves for this purpose . 
 Provision of horses for the peacetime requirements of the Force 
 Supply of mobilised Territorial units within the county . 
 Payment of allowances to families of men in the Force when called out for service , and the care of reservists and discharged soldiers . 
 = = = Part II — the Territorial Force = = = 
 Part II of the Act permitted the establishment of the Territorial Force . Regulations for government , discipline and pay were to be made by the Crown , with certain caveats . Any existing enactment which applied to the Militia , Yeomanry or Volunteers could be extended to the Territorial Force by an Order in Council . A number of enactments were subsequently applied by an order of 19 March 1908 : <unk> of the Railway Act 1842 , <unk> of the Railway Act 1844 , <unk> of the National Defence Act 1888 , <unk> of the Friendly Societies Act 1896 , the whole of the Officers Commissions Act 1862 , and part of <unk> of the Regulation of Forces Act 1871 . 
 = = = = Enlistment and terms of service = = = = 
 Men were to be enlisted into the Force by a specific county association and as part of a specific corps ; if that corps contained multiple units , he was to be posted to one of his choosing . As with the Regular Army , men were not permitted to be transferred from one corps to another or to a regular unit without their consent . Periods of service were not to exceed four years , and could be extended for a further four years at the end of that period . If the Force was called out for permanent service when the time for a man 's discharge came due , he could be required to prolong his service by up to twelve months . A member of the Force could buy his discharge before the end of his term by giving three months notice and paying a sum of up to five pounds , except in times of embodiment for service , and could be discharged for disobedience to orders or misconduct as judged by his commanding officer . First appointments to the lowest grade of officer in any Territorial Force unit were to be given to persons recommended by the association president , provided they fulfilled all the necessary qualifications . 
 As well as regular drills prescribed by regulation , recruits to the Force were to attend annual training for eight to fifteen days per year ( eight to eighteen for cavalry ) , with the Crown able to extend the period of training up to thirty days or abandon annual training altogether as necessary . 
 The Act provided for a number of military offences and their punishments , including failure to attend on embodiment , failure to fulfil the conditions of training , and sale or destruction of government property . It also provided for the method by which offences against this act , or the Army Act , were to be tried . Members of the Force could , however , not be punished for any absence relating to voting in a Parliamentary election . 
 Members of the Force were exempt from service as a peace officer or parish officer , and could not be compelled to serve on a jury ; field officers could not be required to serve as a high sheriff . Officers of the Force who were sheriffs were discharged from performing this duty when embodied , with the responsibility taken by the under sheriff . Accepting a commission as an officer of the Force did not vacate the seat of a Member of Parliament . 
 The Army Act applied to the Territorial Force and its members in the same way it applied to the Militia , with the addition of dismissal as a form of punishment , and was amended accordingly by the First Schedule of the Act . 
 = = = = <unk> of the Territorial Force = = = = 
 Once a proclamation had been issued ordering the Army Reserve to be called out for permanent service , the Crown was legally permitted to order the Army Council to issue directions to embody all or part of the Territorial Force . If no such order was forthcoming , however , then unless Parliament directed otherwise the Army Council was to issue a direction for the embodiment of the entire Force . If Parliament was not sitting at the time of the proclamation , it was to resume its session within ten days . The Crown was able to issue a proclamation <unk> the whole Force , and until such proclamation was issued the Army Council was permitted to embody or <unk> such elements of the Force as they saw fit . 
 When embodied , the Territorial Force , and its members , were liable for service anywhere within the United Kingdom , but could not be ordered out of the country . However , it was provided that any part of the Force , through its commanding officer , could offer to subject themselves to the liability for overseas service , or to be called out for military service within the country for defensive purposes even when the Territorial Force was not embodied . The Act took pains to ensure that " A person shall not be compelled to make such an offer , or be subjected to such liability ... except by his own consent " , and required commanding officers to explain to every man that the offer was purely voluntary . 
 = = = = Transfer of units to the Territorial Force = = = = 
 Where a County Association had been formed , an Order in Council could be made providing for the transfer of specified Yeomanry and Volunteer units from that county , in whole or in part , into the Territorial Force . These units would be deemed to have been lawfully formed units of the Territorial Force as of the date of that Order . As of that date , every officer and man in the unit would be deemed to be a member of the Territorial Force ; however , this was not to affect their terms of service . An Order in Council was made under this section on 19 March 1908 , which transferred all existing units of the Yeomanry and Volunteers , with a small number of exceptions . 
 = = = Part III — the Special Reserve = = = 
 Part III of the Act dealt with the expansion of the Army Reserve , the creation of a new class of reservists in the Special Reserve , and the transfer of militia units . 
 It extended the Reserve Forces Act 1882 to allow the enlistment of men who had not served in the regular forces , to be known as " special reservists " . Special reservists were permitted to agree to serve for an indefinite period without discharge , and could agree in writing to be liable for callout without a proclamation or order of Parliament . No more than four thousand men could be liable under this latter provision at any one time , and the power was not to be exercised except for overseas service when " warlike operations are in preparation or in progress " . The Reserve Forces and Militia Act 1898 was extended to allow up to six thousand men in total to be liable for callout without proclamation , and for the period of their liability to be up to two years . 
 The Special Reserve was to be organised by regulations issued under the Reserve Forces Act 1882 , forming regiments and battalions either of existing regular corps or of newly created ones . The Crown was given the power to transfer , by Order in Council , existing battalions of the Militia to the Special Reserve , which were to be deemed lawfully formed battalions of special reservists as of that date . An Order in Council was accordingly made under this section on 9 April 1908 , which transferred all units of the Militia , other than those which disbanded , into the Special Reserve . 
 Every officer of such a battalion was deemed a member of the Reserve of Officers , and every man a special reservist , though no individual 's condition of service could be altered without their consent . Acceptance of a commission as a member of the Reserve of Officers would not vacate the seat of a sitting Member of Parliament . 
 = = = Part IV — Supplemental = = = 
 Part IV of the Act contained a number of minor provisions relating to the administration of the Act , including provisions for the system of Orders in Council , definitions of terms ( mostly as in the Army Act ) , and the application of the Act to Scotland and the Isle of Man . 
 There were three schedules ; the first listed the specific amendments to the Army Act , whilst the second and third gave a listing of cities and towns and defined which county they were deemed to be part of for the purposes of the Act . 
 The Act did not repeal any existing legislation , so the various Militia Acts dating back to the time of King Charles II remained nominally in force . 
 = = Implementation of the Act = = 
 The formation of County Associations proceeded smoothly ; on 21 August , two weeks after the Act received royal assent , it was reported that Associations were being formed in Staffordshire , Warwickshire and Worcestershire . The War Office issued a model scheme for their constitutions in September , along with advisory notes , which were sent to the lords lieutenant of all counties . The first appointments were made to the divisional commands on 29 October . 
 The Territorial Force formally came into existence on 1 April 1908 , at which date the existing Volunteer force ceased to exist . Under an Order in Council of 19 March , all existing units of the Yeomanry and Volunteers had been transferred to the Territorial Force , with a small number of exceptions . The transferred units were reorganised and amalgamated to produce a force of the anticipated size ; with the exception of a small number of Royal Horse Artillery batteries , every new Territorial Force unit could trace its lineage to a Volunteer or Yeomanry unit . 
 The Territorial Force now constituted 204 infantry battalions ( ten of which were organised as bicycle infantry ) and 56 Yeomanry regiments , organised into fourteen divisions and fourteen cavalry brigades , along with associated support troops . A new all @-@ Territorial regiment , the London Regiment , was formed to encompass twenty @-@ seven battalions which had previously been associated with various regular regiments . The divisional troops were raised and administered by the County Associations , whilst the divisions themselves were operationally commanded by regular staff officers . Outside of the divisional structure , a Territorial Medical Corps was created , followed by a Territorial Association Nursing Service . 
 Once the units had been transferred , their members had to decide whether they would re @-@ enlist in the Territorial Force ; the threshold for recognition was given as 30 % of the establishment strength . By 5 May , the War Office had recognised 85 % of the Yeomanry , 78 % of the Artillery , 59 % of the Engineers and 84 % of the Infantry units ; the total enlistment was 28 % of establishment . By 1 June , the total enlistment was 48 % of establishment , and the first summer camp was organised . By the end of 1908 , the Territorial Force stood at 68 % of establishment strength , and a popular recruiting campaign in the following spring led by the Daily Mail brought it up to 88 % . In the summer of 1909 , a new Territorial reserve force , the " Veteran Reserve " , was announced ; it began recruiting in 1910 , and by the beginning of 1913 contained almost 200 @,@ 000 men . 
 The Militia remained legally in existence , with 23 battalions which were surplus to requirements disbanded . The 101 battalions which were planned to be transferred to the Reserves trained as Militia in 1908 , but amalgamated thereafter with the regular regiments , forming Special Reserve battalions ( usually the 3rd Battalion ) ; 74 were assigned to line regiments , and 27 as duplicate " Extra Special Reserve " battalions . By the end of the year , the Special Reserve as at 84 % of its nominal strength ; those officers and men who had not chosen to transfer remained enrolled in the Militia , serving out their six @-@ year enlistments . By January 1913 , only 700 of them remained , and this vestige quickly disappeared . All the battalions which transferred from the Militia were infantry units ( with the exception of two Irish artillery units ) . 
 A group of anomalous units , as mentioned above , had not been transferred into the new system ; these were the two Irish Yeomanry regiments and the Volunteers of Bermuda and the Isle of Man . The decision had been taken to have no Territorial Force units in Ireland and so the two yeomanry regiments were disbanded and reconstituted in the Special Reserve as the North Irish Horse and South Irish Horse . The Isle of Man Volunteers and Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps remained organised as Volunteers ; whilst the new legislation did extend to the Isle of Man , the force was not reorganised there partly due to the difficulty of changing to annual training . Bermuda , the Channel Islands and Malta were not encompassed by the scope of the legislation , and so the Militia there continued to operate under the old system . 
 = = = Subsequent legislation = = = 
 The Army ( Annual ) Act 1909 gave the Territorial Force powers of billeting in private accommodation when embodied . 
 Under the Military Service Act 1916 , which introduced conscription , the provisions of the Act which prevented a Territorial soldier from being transferred to a different corps , or a regular unit , without his consent were suspended . 
 The Territorial Army and Militia Act 1921 changed the Territorial Force into the Territorial Army , and the Special Reserve returned to its old title of Militia . The Air Force ( Constitution ) Act 1917 had created a reserve and an auxiliary force for the newly constituted Royal Air Force , and the Auxiliary Air Force and Air Force Reserve Act 1924 modified the 1907 Act so as to allow County Associations to administer the Territorial Army and the Auxiliary Air Force . The Auxiliary and Reserve Forces Act 1949 gave the County Associations responsibility for the Army Cadet Force . 
 The Act was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1966 . In the Republic of Ireland , where it had ceased to have force after independence , it was formally repealed as obsolete by the Statute Law Revision Act 1983 . In India , it was identified by the Law Commission of India in 1957 as being no longer useful , and accordingly was repealed by the British Statutes ( Application To India ) Repeal Act , 1960 . 
 The legislation currently governing the Territorial Army is the Reserve Forces Act 1996 . 
 = Blackcurrant = 
 The blackcurrant ( Ribes nigrum ) is a woody shrub in the family <unk> grown for its piquant berries . It is native to temperate parts of central and northern Europe and northern Asia where it prefers damp fertile soils and is widely cultivated both commercially and domestically . It is winter hardy but cold weather at flowering time during the spring reduces the size of the crop . <unk> of small , glossy black fruit develop along the stems in the summer and can be harvested by hand or by machine . The fruit is rich in vitamin C , various other nutrients , phytochemicals and antioxidants . Blackcurrants can be eaten raw but are usually cooked in a variety of sweet or savoury dishes . They are used to make jams , jellies and syrups and are grown commercially for the juice market . The fruit is also used in the preparation of alcoholic beverages and both fruit and foliage have uses in traditional medicine and the preparation of dyes . 
 As a crop , the blackcurrant suffers from several pests and diseases . The most serious disease is reversion , caused by a virus transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite . Another is white pine blister rust which alternates between two unrelated hosts , one in the genus Ribes ( blackcurrant included ) and the other a white pine . This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America , where the native white pines have no genetic resistance to the disease . As a result , the blackcurrant has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts of the United States as a disease vector . The effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable , since other Ribes species also host the disease and are native to North America . 
 Breeding is being undertaken in Europe and New Zealand to produce fruit with better eating qualities and bushes with greater hardiness and disease resistance . 
 = = Description = = 
 Ribes nigrum , the blackcurrant , is a medium @-@ sized shrub , growing to 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) by 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) . The leaves are alternate , simple , 3 to 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 0 in ) broad and long with five palmate lobes and a serrated margin . All parts of the plant are strongly aromatic . The flowers are produced in racemes known as " <unk> " up to 8 cm ( 3 in ) long containing ten to twenty flowers , each about 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 3 in ) in diameter . Each flower has a hairy calyx with yellow glands , the five lobes of which are longer than the inconspicuous petals . There are five stamens surrounding the stigma and style and two fused carpels . The flowers open in succession from the base of the <unk> and are mostly insect pollinated , but some pollen is distributed by the wind . A pollen grain landing on a stigma will germinate and send a slender pollen tube down the style to the ovule . In warm weather this takes about 48 hours but in cold weather it may take a week , and by that time , the ovule may have passed the stage where it is receptive . If fewer than about 35 ovules are fertilised , the fruit may not be able to develop and will fall prematurely . Frost can damage both unopened and open flowers when the temperature falls below <unk> ° C ( 28 @.@ 5 ° F ) . The flowers at the base of the <unk> are more protected by the foliage and are less likely to be damaged . 
 In midsummer the <unk> of green fruit ripen to edible berries , very dark purple in colour , almost black , with glossy skins and persistent <unk> at the apex , each containing many seeds . An established bush can produce about 4 @.@ 5 kilograms ( 10 pounds ) of fruit each year . 
 Plants from Northern Asia are sometimes distinguished as a separate variety , Ribes nigrum var. <unk> , of which Ribes cyathiforme is considered a synonym . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 = = = Site selection and planting = = = 
 Blackcurrants can grow well on sandy or heavy loams , or forest soils , as long as their nutrient requirements are met . They prefer damp , fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought . Although the bushes are winter hardy , frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers . A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic . Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring , but container @-@ grown stock can be planted at any time of year . 
 Two @-@ year @-@ old bushes are usually planted but strong one @-@ year @-@ old stock can also be used . Planting certified stock avoids the risk of introducing viruses . On a garden scale the plants can be set at intervals of 1 @.@ 5 to 1 @.@ 8 metres ( 5 to 6 ft ) or they can be set in rows with planting intervals of 1 @.@ 2 metres ( 4 ft ) and row separations of 2 @.@ 5 metres ( 8 ft ) or more . In the UK , young bushes are generally planted deeper than their initial growing level to encourage new stems to grow from the base . 
 = = = <unk> and fertilizers = = = 
 The blackcurrant requires a number of essential nutrients to be present to enable it to thrive ; nitrogen provides strong plant growth and stimulates the production of flower sprigs ; phosphorus aids growth , the setting of fruit and crop yield ; potassium promotes growth of individual shoots and increases the weight of individual fruits ; magnesium is a constituent of chlorophyll and helps increase yields through interaction with potassium ; calcium is required for cell division and enlargement and is particularly important for young plants and buds . 
 An annual spring mulch of well rotted manure is ideal and poultry manure can also be used but needs prior composting with straw or other waste vegetable material . Spent mushroom compost can be used but care should be taken as it often contains lime and blackcurrants prefer slightly acidic soils . The blackcurrant is a gross feeder and benefits from additional nitrogen , and phosphatic and potash fertilisers should also be applied annually . A balanced artificial fertilizer can be used and a 10 @-@ 10 @-@ 10 granular product can be spread around the bushes at the rate of .10 to <unk> kg ( 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 5 lb ) per plant . Weed growth can be suppressed with an organic mulch such as sawdust , bark , mushroom compost or straw , heavy plastic topped with an organic mulch cover or landscape fabric . 
 = = = Pruning = = = 
 Fruit in blackcurrants is borne primarily on one @-@ year @-@ old shoots . Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely , cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level . This gives the plant a chance to get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit . The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting . The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new shoots . An established bush should not be allowed to become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year . When harvesting by machine , plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged . 
 = = = Harvesting = = = 
 On a garden scale , the berries should be picked when dry and ripe . Commercially , most harvesting is done mechanically by straddle harvesters . These move continually down the rows , straddling a row of bushes , shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit . The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time , some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row . A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers . The bins should be stored in a cool place . Some fruit is still picked by hand for use in the fresh fruit market . 
 = = = Diseases and pests = = = 
 Ribes plants are susceptible to several diseases and a number of insect pests . However , new varieties have been developed , or are being developed , to overcome some of these problems . 
 Reversion is a serious disease transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite <unk> ribis . It causes a decline in yield and is quite widespread in Europe but is rarely encountered on other continents . Symptoms include a modification of leaf shape in summer and swollen buds ( " big bud " ) in winter , each housing thousands of microscopic mites . As pest control has limited effectiveness , severely infected bushes should be destroyed . All new plants purchased should be certified as virus @-@ free . 
 White pine blister rust ( <unk> <unk> ) needs two alternate hosts to complete its lifecycle . One host is plants in the genus Ribes . On the blackcurrant , it causes the leaves to become pale and later develop tiny orange pustules and sometimes a yellow filamentous coating on some leaves . The fruit crop is little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year . The other host is any of the white pines , in which it causes serious disease and mortality for the North American species that have not co @-@ evolved with the rust . 
 American gooseberry mildew and powdery mildew can infect the leaves and shoot tips , and botrytis may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season . Currant and gooseberry leaf spot ( <unk> ribis ) is another disease of blackcurrants , but it is not usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance . 
 The blackcurrant leaf midge can cause browning , crimping and distortion of leaves at the tips of shoots but it is seldom a serious problem . The blackcurrant sawfly ( <unk> <unk> ) lays its eggs on the underside of the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots , stripping off leaf after leaf . In a serious attack , the bush can be denuded of leaves . Larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots , which wilt and die back . Other insect pests include scale insects , aphids and earwigs . 
 = = = Research and breeding = = = 
 There are many cultivars of blackcurrant . ' Baldwin ' was the mainstay of the industry for many years but it has now largely been superseded by more productive and disease @-@ resistant varieties . During the 20th century in Europe , much hybridisation work has been carried out in order to reduce the plant 's susceptibility to disease and frost and also to increase yields . This effort centred especially on Russia , Sweden and Scotland . 
 In Britain the Scottish Crop Research Institute was tasked with developing new varieties suitable for growing in the north of the country . They produced new cultivars that had greater cold tolerance , especially in the spring , ripened earlier and more evenly and had greater fungal disease resistance . Frost tolerance was improved by selecting for late flowering and genetic research identified genes involved in resistance to gall mite and the blackcurrant reversion virus . ' Ben Lomond ' was the first of the ' Ben ' varieties and was released in 1975 . This was followed by several other cultivars for the juicing industry such as ' Ben Alder ' and ' Ben <unk> ' . The cultivar ' Ben Hope ' was released in 1998 with resistance to gall mite , and in the same year , ' Ben Gairn ' became available . It shows resistance to the reversion virus . For gardeners and the pick @-@ your @-@ own market , ' Ben Sarek ' , ' Ben <unk> ' and ' Big Ben ' were introduced and have large , sweet berries . The cultivars ' Ben <unk> ' , ' Ben Lomond ' and ' Ben Sarek ' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society 's Award of Garden <unk> and new varieties are being developed continually to improve frost tolerance , disease resistance , machine harvesting , fruit quality , nutritional content and fruit flavour . 
 Varieties producing green fruit , less strongly flavoured and sweeter than typical blackcurrants , are cultivated in Finland , where they are called " <unk> " ( <unk> ) . In Poland , the Research Institute of Horticulture has done work on improving the blackcurrant with regard to disease and pest resistance , fruit quality , adaptations to local conditions and mechanical harvesting . Researchers have crossed various varieties and introduced inter @-@ specific genetic material from the gooseberry ( Ribes <unk> ) , the red currant ( Ribes rubrum ) and the flowering currant ( Ribes sanguineum ) . The resulting offspring were further back @-@ crossed to R. nigrum . Cultivars produced include ' <unk> ' and ' <unk> ' in 2000 and ' <unk> ' , ' Ruben ' and ' Tines ' in 2005 . Further cultivars ' <unk> ' and ' <unk> ' are being tested . Since 1991 , New Zealand has become an important centre for research and development , as its temperate climate is particularly suitable for cultivation of the crop . Breeding programmes are concentrating on yield , large fruit size , consistency of cropping and upright habit . 
 In North America , there is a need for this fruit to have resistance to white pine blister rust . New cultivars such as ' Crusader ' , ' Coronet ' and ' Consort ' have been developed there by crossing R. nigrum with R. <unk> and these show resistance to the disease . However the quality and yield of these varieties are poor as compared to non @-@ resistant strains and only Consort is reliably self @-@ fertile . Back @-@ crossing these varieties to a parent have produced new strains such as ' Titania ' that have a higher yield , better disease resistance , are more tolerant of adverse weather conditions and are suitable for machine harvesting . Two new releases from a black currant breeding program in British Columbia , Canada , ' Blackcomb ' and ' <unk> ' , were selected for their immunity to white pine blister rust and their frost tolerance . 
 = = History = = 
 The blackcurrant is native to northern Europe and Asia . It was cultivated in Russia by the 11th century when it was present in monastery gardens and also grown in towns and settlements . Cultivation in Europe is thought to have started around the last decades of the 17th century . <unk> of the leaves , bark or roots was also used as traditional remedies . 
 During World War II , most fruits rich in vitamin C , such as oranges , became difficult to obtain in the United Kingdom . Since blackcurrant berries are a rich source of the vitamin and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate , the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation 's crop increased significantly . From 1942 onwards , blackcurrant syrup was distributed free of charge to children under the age of two , and this may have given rise to the lasting popularity of blackcurrant as a flavouring in Britain . In Britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1 @,@ 400 hectares of the fruit are grown , mostly under contract to the juicing industry . Commercially , most large @-@ scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market . 
 Blackcurrants were once popular in the United States as well , but became less common in the 20th century after currant farming was banned in the early 1900s , when blackcurrants , as a vector of white pine blister rust , were considered a threat to the U.S. logging industry . The federal ban on growing currants was shifted to jurisdiction of individual states in 1966 , and was lifted in New York State in 2003 through the efforts of horticulturist Greg Quinn . As a result , currant growing is making a comeback in New York , Vermont , Connecticut and Oregon . However , several statewide bans still exist including Maine , New Hampshire , Virginia and Massachusetts . Since the American federal ban curtailed currant production nationally for nearly a century , the fruit remains largely unknown in the United States , and has yet to regain its previous popularity to levels enjoyed in Europe or New Zealand . Owing to its unique flavour and richness in polyphenols , dietary fibre and essential nutrients , awareness and popularity of blackcurrant is once again growing , with a number of consumer products entering the U.S. market . 
 = = Uses = = 
 = = = Culinary uses = = = 
 The fruit of blackcurrants can be eaten raw , but it has a strong , tart flavour . It can be made into jams and jellies which set readily because of the fruit 's high content of pectin and acid . For culinary use , the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a purée , which can then be passed through muslin to separate the juice . The purée can be used to make blackcurrant preserves and be included in <unk> , yogurt , ice cream , desserts , sorbets and many other sweet dishes . The exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining it with other fruits , such as raspberries and strawberries in summer pudding , or apples in crumbles and pies . The juice can be used in syrups and cordials . Blackcurrants are a common ingredient of <unk> , a popular kissel @-@ like dessert in North German and Danish cuisines . 
 Blackcurrants are also used in savoury cooking because their astringency creates added flavour in many sauces , meat and other dishes and they are included in some unusual combinations of foods . They can be added to tomato and mint to make a salad , used to accompany roast or grilled lamb , used to accompany seafood and shellfish , used as a dipping sauce at barbecues , blended with mayonnaise , used to invigorate bananas and other tropical fruits , combined with dark chocolate or added to mincemeat in traditional mince pies at Christmas .

 The juice forms the basis for various popular cordials , juice drinks , juices and smoothies . Typically blended with apple or other red fruits , it is also mixed with pomegranate and grape juice . <unk> blackcurrants are also the primary ingredient in the apéritif liqueur crème de cassis , which in turn is added to white wine to produce a Kir or to champagne to make a Kir Royale . 
 In the United Kingdom , blackcurrant cordial is often mixed with cider ( hard cider ) to make a drink called " cider and black " . If made with any common British lager beer , it is known as a " lager and black " . The addition of blackcurrant to a mix of cider and lager results in " diesel " or " snakebite and black " available at pubs . A " black ' n ' black " can be made by adding a small amount of blackcurrant juice to a pint of stout . The head is purple if the shot of juice is placed in the glass first . Blackcurrant juice is sometimes combined with whey in an endurance / energy @-@ type drink . 
 In Russia , blackcurrant leaves may be used for flavouring tea or preserves , such as salted cucumbers , and berries for home winemaking . <unk> vodka may also be infused with blackcurrant leaves making a deep greenish @-@ yellow beverage with a tart flavour and astringent taste . The berries may be infused in a similar manner .

 = Llanishen Reservoir = 
 Llanishen Reservoir ( Welsh : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) is a Victorian reservoir in North Cardiff in Wales . The reservoir is one of the reservoirs constructed as part of the Taff Fawr scheme for supplying water to Cardiff and was completed in 1886 . It forms part of the Nant Fawr Corridor from the top of Roath Park to the countryside beyond Cyncoed . 
 The reservoir was used for water supply until the mid @-@ 1970s when it became redundant . It was then used for leisure activities and for ' topping up ' the adjacent Lisvane Reservoir until it was drained completely . After buying Hyder plc , its new owner Western Power Distribution ( WPD ) , proposed to redevelop the reservoir site , but after a series of objections from national governing bodies , the County Council , local residents and both local and national politicians this was blocked . On 30 August 2013 WPD sold both Llanishen and Lisvane reservoirs to CELSA Group . 
 In January 2016 , Welsh Water acquired both Llanishen and Lisvane reservoirs from CELSA Group on a 999 year lease , which allows Welsh Water to use both reservoirs for water supply and recreational purposes while also allowing CELSA UK to continue to take its water supply from the Lisvane reservoir . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1881 , a report was commissioned on water resources within a reasonable distance of Cardiff . The report concluded that the Taff Fawr scheme would fulfil the town 's requirements at the least cost and it was decided to create Llanishen Reservoir . Construction of the reservoir started in 1882 by the engineer James Simpson for the Cardiff Waterworks Company and was completed in 1886 . 
 The reservoir is retained by an earth @-@ filled embankment with a clay core some 10 metres ( 33 ft ) high and about 1 @,@ 173 metres ( 3 @,@ 848 ft ) long . The external embankment face is grassed whilst the internal face has stone pitching over the upper part and concrete over the lower part . It has a maximum surface area of water of 23 @.@ 8 hectares ( 59 acres ) and a capacity of 1 @,@ 440 @,@ 909 cubic metres ( 50 @,@ 885 @,@ 200 cu ft ) . 
 The reservoir is underlain by the St Maughan 's Formation of the Lower Devonian age . Glacial till deposits of the Devonian age form part of the northern shore of the reservoir . The reservoir may be on the northern limb of the Cowbridge anticline . 
 The reservoir was transferred to Welsh Water in 1973 when the Welsh Water Authority was formed , and it supplied water until the mid @-@ 1970s . In 1996 Welsh Water 's holding company was renamed as Hyder plc and the group acquired South Wales Electricity plc . After Hyder 's share price collapsed in 1999 and 2000 , the Hyder Group was sold to WPD on terms recommended by the Hyder Board after a competitive and hostile takeover battle . WPD is the American @-@ owned electricity distribution network operator for South West England and South and West Wales . 
 Welsh Assembly members were concerned that the takeover would mean jobs being transferred to Bristol and Cheshire , and at its effect " on consumers ' interests , on the environment , and on the wider economy " . 
 WPD acquired the reservoir from Welsh Water in 2001 when Welsh Water was acquired by the not @-@ for @-@ profit organisation Glas Cymru : the reservoir was sold to a WPD subsidiary , Hyder Industrial Group Ltd , which was later renamed Western Power Distribution Investments Ltd . 
 The reservoir , which forms part of the Nant Fawr corridor , has been redundant since the 1970s and has only been used for leisure purposes and for ' topping up ' the adjacent Lisvane Reservoir . 
 = = Protection = = 
 The reservoir is listed as a Site of Nature Conservation Interest ( SNCI ) as it has pondweed and <unk> , and common toads breed there . The grassland and scrub surrounding the reservoir is also an SNCI due to the grass snakes and slow @-@ worms there . 
 The banks of the reservoir are listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) due to the diversity of waxcap fungi discovered growing on them . WPD appealed against this listing stating the Countryside Council for Wales 's ( CCW ) decision was ' premature , <unk> and unfair ' , but in January 2007 a High Court Judge upheld the SSSI designation and said it was ' an important site ' . 
 The reservoir was also listed by Cadw in July 2009 as a building of special architectural or historic interest , despite an appeal from WPD against the listing . 
 = = Leisure = = 
 Until Spring 2010 , Cardiff Sailing Centre operated at the reservoir offering dinghy sailing , windsurfing , powerboating and canoeing courses . The centre , which is owned and managed by Cardiff County Council had been running at the reservoir for 30 years , though had to relocate to Cardiff Bay to continue operating due to the drain @-@ down . 
 The Centre has gained national recognition as both a ' grass @-@ roots ' training centre through the RYA 's <unk> scheme and as a first class race training centre & club . The Centre has also produced National & International class sailors over the years . 
 The reservoir was also once popular with anglers ( through the Cardiff Fly Fishing Club ) , picnickers , birdwatchers and walkers . Fishing at the reservoir stopped in 1998 and many of the other activities have been curtailed since 2004 due to the security fence that was constructed around the banks of the reservoir and ( less securely ) to the site boundary . 
 Many people still walk between the ' inner ' and ' outer ' fences , due to a number of natural and man @-@ made gaps in the outer fence and the natural hedges . Although the site is monitored , only some of the ' gaps ' are <unk> . 
 = = Proposed redevelopment = = 
 WPD have proposed redevelopment since 2002 . The latest proposal is for 300 new homes , surrounding a much reduced water area , and a connected ' wetland area ' , as well as a new sailing club and wildlife and education centre . This proposal was recommended by the Planning Inspector , but rejected by the Environment Minister . WPD requested a judicial review of the decision and the minister withdrew her defence after considering WPD 's submission . The Court referred the decision back to the minister and a decision is awaited . 
 In March 2010 , work started to drain the legal limit of 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) of water from the reservoir into the nearby Nant Fawr stream . WPD say that the drain @-@ down is required as a result of a statutory inspection carried out by WS Atkins PLC . But the Environment Agency have disagreed . The drainage is opposed by opponents of the redevelopment , who claim that the reservoir will take 8 years to refill if totally emptied . 
 The public enquiry considered the requirement for drain @-@ down and the ecological effects in detail . On the drain @-@ down the Planning Inspector concluded that opponents ' suspicions had been " fully rebutted " . And after considering a lot of evidence the Inspector concluded that CCW were content for development to proceed and that " significant ecological benefits would result from the development " . 
 In May 2010 , WPD applied to the Environment Agency for a discharge licence in order to completely drain the reservoir , which was granted in July 2010 . The issue was taken to UK Parliament by Jonathan Evans where he stated that an independent report by the Halcrow Group ( advising for the Environment Agency ) explained that draining the reservoir could create ' new risks to reservoir safety ' . Evans ' predecessor , Julie Morgan , had previously taken the issue of saving the reservoir site to parliament , and had garnered support from politicians such as Peter Hain ( the Welsh Secretary ) and Ed Miliband ( later leader of the Labour Party ) , who visited the site during the May 2010 general election campaign , commenting on the site 's tranquillity . 
 In March 2011 , WPD applied to Cardiff County Council for planning permission for a <unk> on Lisvane Road and listed building consent to alter the structure of the reservoir . Both of these were called in by the Welsh Government . During the appeal a number of changes to the original appeal were submitted by WPD and accepted by all parties . The appeal was heard during the Summer of 2011 . 
 On 25 April 2013 , The Welsh Government refused the planning appeal from WPD which was for 324 homes . 
 On 30 August 2013 , CELSA Group bought both Llanishen and Lisvane reservoirs from their owner Western Power Distribution , to assure its Cardiff rod mill plant a consistent supply of water from Lisvane . 
 In January 2016 , Welsh Water acquired both Llanishen and Lisvane reservoirs from CELSA Group on a 999 year lease . The campaign against development of the site led by the Reservoir Action Group welcomed the move and hoped that the site could be reopened to the public in future . 
 = Drosera = 
 Drosera , commonly known as the sundews , is one of the largest genera of carnivorous plants , with at least 194 species . These members of the family Droseraceae lure , capture , and digest insects using stalked mucilaginous glands covering their leaf surfaces . The insects are used to supplement the poor mineral nutrition of the soil in which the plants grow . Various species , which vary greatly in size and form , can be found growing natively on every continent except Antarctica . 
 Both the botanical name ( from the Greek <unk> : <unk> = " dew , dewdrops " ) and the English common name ( sundew , derived from Latin ros solis , meaning " dew of the sun " ) refer to the glistening drops of mucilage at the tip of each tentacle that resemble drops of morning dew . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Sundews are perennial ( or rarely annual ) herbaceous plants , forming prostrate or upright rosettes between 1 and 100 cm ( 0 @.@ 39 and 39 @.@ 37 in ) in height , depending on the species . Climbing species form scrambling stems which can reach much longer lengths , up to 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) in the case of D. <unk> . Sundews have been shown to be able to achieve a lifespan of 50 years . The genus is so specialized for nutrient uptake through its carnivorous behavior , the pygmy sundew is missing the enzymes ( nitrate reductase , in particular ) that plants normally use for the uptake of earth @-@ bound nitrates .

 The genus can be divided into several growth forms : 
 Temperate sundews : These species form a tight cluster of unfurled leaves called a hibernaculum in a winter dormancy period ( = <unk> ) . All of the North American and European species belong to this group . Drosera arcturi from Australia ( including Tasmania ) and New Zealand is another temperate species that dies back to a horn @-@ shaped hibernaculum . 
 Subtropical sundews : These species maintain vegetative growth year @-@ round under uniform or nearly uniform climatic conditions . 
 Pygmy sundews : A group of roughly 40 Australian species , they are distinguished by miniature growth , the formation of gemmae for asexual reproduction , and dense formation of hairs in the crown center . These hairs serve to protect the plants from Australia 's intense summer sun . Pygmy sundews form the subgenus <unk> . 
 Tuberous sundews : These nearly 50 Australian species form an underground tuber to survive the extremely dry summers of their habitat , re @-@ emerging in the autumn . These so @-@ called tuberous sundews can be further divided into two groups , those that form rosettes and those that form climbing or scrambling stems . Tuberous sundews comprise the subgenus <unk> . 
 <unk> complex : A group of tropical Australian species , they live in constantly warm but sometimes wet conditions . Several of the 14 species that comprise this group have developed special strategies to cope with the alternately drier conditions . Many species , for example , have petioles densely covered in trichomes , which maintain a sufficiently humid environment and serve as an increased condensation surface for morning dew . The <unk> complex comprises the subgenus <unk> . 
 Although they do not form a single strictly defined growth form , a number of species are often put together in a further group : 
 Queensland sundews : A small group of three species ( D. adelae , D. <unk> and D. <unk> ) , all are native to highly humid habitats in the dim understories of the Australian rainforest .
