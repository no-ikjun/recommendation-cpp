 Eazy @-@ Duz @-@ It was recorded at Audio Achievements in Torrance , California from 1987 to 1988 . The album 's writing was a three @-@ pronged effort involving MC Ren , Ice Cube , and The D.O.C .. MC Ren 's writing style was described by Marcus Reeves , author of Somebody Scream ! : Rap Music 's Rise to Prominence in the Aftershock of Black Power ( 2009 ) ISBN <unk> , as " elaborate storytelling and acrobatic verbiage " , while the D.O.C. ' s included " syllabically punchy boasts " and Ice Cube wrote , " masterfully insightful first @-@ person narratives . " Ice Cube 's writing was often inspired by comedians like Richard Pryor and Rudy Ray Moore . 
 The album 's production , almost solely done by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella , was praised by several critics . Jason Birchmeier from Allmusic gave a considerable amount of attention to the album 's production , saying that " Dr. Dre and Yella meld together P @-@ Funk , Def Jam @-@ style hip hop , and the leftover electro sounds of mid- [ 19 ] 80s Los Angeles , creating a dense , funky , and thoroughly unique style of their own . " Birchmeier would also write that some songs — " Eazy Duz It " , " We Want Eazy " , " Eazy @-@ er Said Than Dunn " , and " Radio " — are all heavily produced and have " layers upon layers of samples and beats competing with Eazy @-@ E 's rhymes for attention . " Rapper Kanye West also touted Dr. Dre 's production on the album . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Glen Boyd of Blogcritics said that the album has " Deep @-@ ass bass lines , old @-@ school funk samples , and plenty of street smart ghetto attitude are what powers this record . " Jerry Heller wrote that Eazy raps more up front on the album than he does on Straight Outta Compton , and insists that the album 's lyrics contain more sexual humor than gangsta vibe . 
 The album 's title track and lead single " Eazy @-@ Duz @-@ It " , written by MC Ren , opens with a woman acclaiming Eazy @-@ E 's style . Eazy then interrupts saying " Bitch shut the fuck up , get the fuck outta here . " This is followed by a bass line provided by Dr. Dre . Soon , Eazy begins to rap about himself and things that he does . The song declares that Eazy is a " hardcore villain " who collects money from his prostitutes , and feels great when his " pockets are fat . " The chorus , repeated three times , states that he " is a gangsta having fun " . The piece is laden with the aural mainstays of gangsta rap , including gunshots , and references to several drugs . 
 " Boyz n the Hood " was written by Ice Cube , with some contribution by Eazy @-@ E. The song is about growing up in Compton , California , and describes the gangster lifestyle . It conceives the " ghetto landscape as a generalized abstract construct … [ and ] also introduces a localized nuance that conveys a certain proximity , effectively capturing a narrowed sense of place through which young thugs and their potential crime victims move in tandem , " as put by cultural historian Murray Forman . 
 " No More ? ' s " is similar to " Boyz n the Hood " in its theme . The piece begins with an interview between Eazy and a female journalist , who asks about his childhood . Eazy explains ( in verse ) that he was ruthless , in a gang , " specialized in <unk> , " ( loosely , to steal from ) and had no respect for rules . He is then asked if he has ever been in an armed robbery . He responds , " You mean a 211 ? " The following verses tell of Eazy 's exploits as a thief and thug .

 The album received little attention from radio and television stations , but got support from Los Angeles 's hip @-@ hop underground . On May 20 , 1989 , it peaked at number 41 on the Billboard 200 , and since 1989 , was in various places on the chart for 90 weeks . It peaked at number 12 on the Top R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Albums chart on March 11 , 1989 . Since the album 's release , it has been on the chart during 51 different weeks . On February 15 , 1989 , the album was certified Gold ( 500 @,@ 000 sales ) by the Recording Industry Association of America , and on June 1 , 1989 , it was certified Platinum ( 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sales ) . It received its peak certification of Double Platinum ( 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sales ) on September 1 , 1992 . In 1989 , it had sold over 650 @,@ 000 copies , and by early 1995 , Eazy @-@ Duz @-@ It had sold between 2 million and 2 @.@ 5 million copies . On February 11 , 1989 , " We Want Eazy " charted on the R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs at number 43 . It stayed on the chart for 15 weeks . The song also charted at number seven on the Hot Rap Songs chart . " Eazy @-@ er Said Than Dunn " , the album 's third single , peaked at number 84 on the R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs charts on May 6 , 1989 , where it would maintain some lower position on the chart for six weeks . " Eazy @-@ Duz @-@ It " charted on the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart at number 39 . In August 2015 , a couple weeks after the release of the N.W.A. biopic film , Straight Outta Compton , the album re @-@ entered the chart at number 32 , out @-@ peaking its original peak position in 1989 when it charted at number 41 .

 AllMusic 's Jason Birchmeier praised the album , awarding the album four out of five stars . Birchmeier noted that " the album plays like a humorous , self @-@ centered twist on Straight Outta Compton with Eazy @-@ E , the most charismatic member of N.W.A , front and center while his associates are busy behind the scenes , producing the beats and writing the songs . " He compared it to N.W.A 's Straight Outta Compton , which Eazy also performs on , saying that Straight Outta Compton is " more revolutionary , " but claimed Eazy @-@ Duz @-@ It to be Straight Outta Compton 's " great companion " and to have showcased N.W.A 's style . 
 Music journalist Robert Christgau gave the album a C + , criticizing the thin beats and lyrics like " I might be a woman beater but I 'm not a pussy eater " Soren Baker from the Los Angeles Times called it a " landmark albums brimming with violence , profanity , sexually explicit content and antigovernment themes , " and said that it established Eazy as a " major player in the rap industry " Daniel Kreps of the Los Angeles Times called it a " solo masterpiece , " and said that it was evidence that Eazy was one of the best rappers ever . Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly described the album as " an obscenity @-@ littered depiction of violent , hollowed @-@ out life in Compton . " 
 Shan Fowler from PopMatters said that it received " underground success . " Glen Boyd reviewed the album on the online newspaper Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer , noting that it " paved the way for all of the groundbreaking music which came later . " Boyd also said that songs like " Boyz In The Hood " and " Radio " would establish " the street buzz that N.W.A would later ride to platinum selling success as the first true West Coast rap superstars . " Jon Wiederhorn from MTV wrote that it " demonstrated Eazy 's knack for provocative lyrics , " and also said that it paved the way to Straight Outta Compton .

 = USS Siboney ( ID @-@ 2999 ) = 
 USS Siboney ( ID @-@ 2999 ) was a ship transport for the United States Navy during World War I. She was the sister ship of USS Orizaba ( ID @-@ 1536 ) but neither was part of a ship class . Launched as SS Oriente , she was soon renamed after Siboney , Cuba , a landing site of United States forces during the Spanish – American War . After her navy service ended , she was SS Siboney for the Ward Line and American Export Lines . During World War II she served the U.S. Army as transport USAT Siboney and as hospital ship USAHS Charles A. Stafford . 
 As a transport during World War I , Siboney made 17 transatlantic voyages for the navy carrying troops to and from Europe , and had the shortest average in @-@ port turnaround time of all navy transports . During her maiden voyage , her steering gear malfunctioned which resulted in a collision between two other troopships in the convoy . 
 After her World War I service ended , Siboney was returned to the Ward Line and placed in New York – Cuba – Spain transatlantic service ; the liner ran aground at Vigo , Spain in September 1920 . Despite considerable damage , she was repaired and placed back in service . In late 1921 , Siboney was switched to New York – Cuba – Mexico routes , which were a popular and inexpensive way for Americans to escape Prohibition . In late 1940 , she was chartered to American Export Lines to return Americans fleeing Europe at the outset of World War II , making seven roundtrips from Jersey City , New Jersey , to Lisbon . 
 During World War II , Siboney was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration and assigned to the War Department as a U.S. Army transport . She made several transatlantic trips and called at ports in Africa , the Middle East , Canada , the Caribbean , and the United Kingdom . During a 1944 overhaul , the ship was selected for conversion to a hospital ship . Renamed USAHS Charles A. Stafford after a U.S. Army doctor killed in action in Australia , the ship served in both the European and the Pacific Theatres . After the end of her army service , the ship was laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet in February 1948 , and sold for scrapping in 1957 .

 SS Oriente was a combination cargo and passenger vessel built by William Cramp and Sons , Philadelphia , for the Ward Line . In mid @-@ 1917 the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) commandeered and received title to all private shipbuilding projects in progress , including the still @-@ incomplete Oriente and her sister ship Orizaba . Plans for both ships were modified for troop carrying duties . Oriente was launched on 15 August 1917 , renamed Siboney on 28 February 1918 , delivered to the navy on 8 April , and commissioned the same day , Commander A.T. Graham in command . 
 Siboney sailed from Philadelphia on 16 April as a unit of the Cruiser and Transport Force , and arrived at Newport News two days later to embark her first contingent of troops . She departed Hampton Roads on 23 April and joined her first convoy the following day . On 25 April , her rudder jammed ; and , in the ensuing confusion , transports Aeolus and Huron collided and had to return to New York . On 4 May , the convoy was joined by the war zone escort of eight destroyers and , on 6 May , Siboney arrived at Brest . <unk> her troops , she sailed the following day and arrived at Hoboken , New Jersey , on 15 May . 
 Siboney embarked her second contingent of troops at Lambert 's Point , Virginia , on 25 May and sailed the following day . The New York section of the convoy joined two days later and the ships entered the war zone on 6 June . In French waters , they were met by USS Corsair , a squadron of minesweepers , an American dirigible , and two French hydroplanes . Siboney arrived in Bordeaux on 8 June and departed the following day but remained anchored in the mouth of the Gironde until 13 June , awaiting the tanker Woonsocket . On 15 June , the convoy passed six empty lifeboats from the torpedoed transport USS President Lincoln . Siboney entered the American war zone on 20 June , and the next day rescued survivors of the British vessel , SS Dwinsk , which had been torpedoed three days previously . The transport arrived at New York on 22 June and anchored in the North River . 
 Siboney sailed for France on 30 June ; after delivering her troops at Brest on 12 July , she returned to New York on 25 July . She sailed again on 31 July . Before arriving at Brest on 12 August , she had to maneuver several times to evade possible submarine contacts . She arrived at New York on 22 August and was given a two @-@ week repair period . 
 On 4 September , Siboney sailed from New York on her fifth crossing and arrived at Saint @-@ Nazaire nine days later . On 15 September , she embarked a number of wounded troops and left Saint @-@ Nazaire the same day , but , due to heavy submarine activity , swung at anchor for several days before her convoy sailed . She arrived on 29 September at New York . On her sixth eastward crossing , between 6 and 15 October , an influenza epidemic broke out among the troops , killing a number of soldiers . Sailing from Brest on 16 October , the transport returned to New York on 24 October . 
 Siboney had already embarked troops for her next voyage when , on 3 November , she was ordered to disembark them . She sailed the following day with an army brigadier general and his staff , and a naval draft of 500 men . She arrived at Saint @-@ Nazaire on the 12 November , shortly after the announcement of the Armistice , and was met by a cheering crowd . 
 Siboney then began her peacetime mission of returning American veterans from Europe to the United States . After embarking 513 wounded men at Saint @-@ Nazaire , she moved to Brest on the 15th and took on 600 more passengers . She sailed the same day under escort and reached New York on 24 November . During the next ten months , Siboney made ten more round trips between the United States and France , returning over 3 @,@ 000 troops per trip when fully loaded . On one such return trip in August 1919 , Siboney carried Admiral Henry T. Mayo and Congressman Thomas S. Butler home from France . 
 Siboney returned to New York on 2 September at the conclusion of her 17th trip , having traveled over 115 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 213 @,@ 000 km ) and transported approximately 55 @,@ 000 military passengers to and from French ports . According to the Statistical Department of the U.S. Navy , Siboney had the shortest average in @-@ port turnaround time out of 37 U.S. Navy transports used during World War I. The ship completed 17 round trips and had an average turn @-@ around time of just under 30 days per trip , almost ten days shorter than the average of 39 @.@ 8 days . 
 On 10 September at Hoboken , Siboney was decommissioned and turned over to the War Department , who returned the ship to the Ward Line , her original owners . 
 = = Interwar civilian service = = 
 After her reacquisition , the Ward Line placed SS Siboney in transatlantic service on a New York to Havana , Tenerife , Bilbao , Santander , and Vigo route . On 9 September 1920 , the ship ran aground in the harbor at Vigo . Initial efforts to re @-@ float her were unsuccessful , but by late October , Siboney had been repaired enough to make it to Shields . Despite considerable damage , Siboney was refitted and placed in service again and , by March 1921 , the Ward Line was advertising passage to Spain via Havana aboard her . The Ward Line , however , abandoned the New York – Cuba – Spain service later in 1921 due to a lack of passengers . 
 By November 1921 , Siboney was placed in New York – Cuba – Mexico service , where business thrived , in part because of Prohibition in the United States . Ward Line cruises to Havana were one of the quickest and least expensive ways to what one author called " alcohol @-@ enriched vacations " . A typical route from this time period would sail from New York and call at Nassau , Havana , Progreso , Veracruz , and Tampico , skipping Nassau on the return . Prohibition also had a more direct effect on Siboney and her crew . On 27 June 1922 , Siboney — freshly returned from Havana with a load of pineapples — was raided by United States Customs Service inspectors who seized 300 bottles of smuggled liquor on board . In December 1923 , four boiler room workers were arrested when police became suspicious of a man who had apparently just delivered a supply of alcohol to the docked ship . 
 Siboney underwent a major refit in 1924 during which time she was replaced on her routes by SS Yucatán , formerly the North German Lloyd ship Prinz Waldemar . After returning to service for the Ward Line , Siboney was the first to relay messages from Miami about the severity of the Great Miami Hurricane when she passed there shortly after the storm hit in September 1926 . 
 On 18 February 1928 , Siboney rammed and sank the coal barge Seneca off Ambrose Light during a snowstorm ; the barge had been cut down in 1915 from SS Seneca , coincidentally , a former Ward Line ship . Bad luck continued for Siboney on 5 January 1929 , when she rammed and sank the Bauer Towing Company tug Phillip Hoffman off the Battery , killing the tug ’ s engineer . 
 Siboney continued her same routes into the 1930s , and by 1933 typical runs for Siboney were from New York to Havana , Progreso , and Veracruz and back , omitting Progreso on the return . On one such return trip from Veracruz and Havana in April 1935 , a passenger had $ 5 @,@ 000 worth of diamond and platinum jewelry stolen while on board . By 1935 , multiple public relations disasters for the Ward Line — the fire and sinking of Morro Castle off New Jersey in 1934 and the grounding of Havana and the sinking of Mohawk in the months that followed — caused the " Ward Line " name to be dropped in favor of the " Cuba Mail Line " moniker . By 1939 , Siboney , still on the New York – Cuba – Mexico route , sported a new paint scheme of " dove grey " hull and black funnels with white markings to reflect this change in name . In late 1940 , however , the struggling Cuba Mail Line chartered Siboney to American Export Lines which employed her on Jersey City – Lisbon service . During her American Export service , one of her passengers to the U.S. was French aviator and writer Antoine de Saint Exupéry , when he immigrated in January 1941 to <unk> , New York after Germany ’ s armistice with France . 
 On 12 April 1941 at 13 : 30 , 320 nautical miles ( 590 km ) out of Lisbon , the ship — painted with a large American flag and " American Export " lettering on each side — was accosted by " two submarine chasers flying British ensigns " that fired shots over Siboney 's bow , one of which landed less than 100 feet ( 30 m ) away from the ship . According to Siboney 's captain , Wenzel <unk> , the two ships were British corvette types marked " K @-@ 25 " and " K @-@ 125 " — which may have been Flower @-@ class corvettes HMS Azalea ( K25 ) and HMCS <unk> ( <unk> ) . After answering questions from " K @-@ 25 " shouted via loudspeaker , Siboney was allowed to resume her course . <unk> filed a protest with British officials when Siboney docked at Bermuda . 
 = = World War II Army service = = 
 At the conclusion of her seventh and final journey for American Export , Siboney was handed over on 28 May 1941 to the U.S. Army for transport duty . After a hasty outfitting , the redesignated USAT Siboney was put to work transporting troops . Based in New York , she made trips up and down the Atlantic and into the Caribbean , and , by the end of 1941 , had called at Bermuda , San Juan , Trinidad , St. John 's , Charleston , Newport News , Cristóbal , Jamaica , and Panama . 
 December 1941 saw Siboney depart from New York to Trinidad and on to Cape Town , then sailing up the east coast of Africa to Basra , Iraq , and Bandar Shahpur , Iran . The ship returned to Cape Town via Aden and underwent routine boiler repairs there , before returning to New York in April 1942 . After undergoing six weeks of repairs at Bethlehem Steel Company , the transport sailed for Halifax , Iceland , and the Clyde , Scotland , in late May , returning to New York in July . Another trip to England and back followed in September 1942 . 
 In early December 1942 Siboney departed for Newfoundland but put into Halifax for two months of <unk> and repairs after she collided with SS City of Kimberly . After returning to New York in February 1943 , she made several transatlantic runs , calling at Casablanca , Oran , Gibraltar , Clyde , Durban , Rio de Janeiro , Trinidad , and Cuba over the next 11 months . Siboney returned to New York for major repairs and <unk> at Bethlehem Steel Co . In January 1944 , while undergoing this work , the ship was selected for conversion to a hospital ship . 
 The ship was renamed USAHS Charles A. Stafford after Captain Charles A. Stafford of the U.S. Army Medical Corps , who was killed during the air raid on Broome , Western Australia , while participating in the evacuation of Java on 3 March 1942 . With her conversion complete in September 1944 , the Stafford , equipped with new boilers , a single stack in place of her original two , and other improvements , moved to her new homeport of Charleston . From that port the ship made monthly runs to the United Kingdom and back until May 1945 , interrupting the pattern only once for a trip to Gibraltar and Marseilles . Steaming to New York at the conclusion of her last transatlantic run , Charles A. Stafford was overhauled for duty in the South Pacific . 
 With the alterations complete , the veteran ship — now homeported at Los Angeles — sailed in August 1945 for <unk> and on to Honolulu , Manila , Biak , Leyte , and Mindoro . After returning to Los Angeles in October , the Stafford sailed for Honolulu , Manila , and Eniwetok and back . 
 After sailing to her new homeport of New York via the Panama Canal during February 1946 , Charles A. Stafford resumed her North Atlantic runs to the UK , which continued until February 1948 , at which time she was laid up in Maritime Commission 's James River Reserve Fleet . Kept on reserve under her original name of Siboney , the ship was delivered by the Maritime Administration to Bethlehem Steel for scrapping on 22 January 1957 . 
 = Rega Planar 3 = 
 The Rega Planar 3 , together with its successors , the P3 and RP3 , is a well @-@ known budget audiophile turntable by British hi @-@ fi manufacturer , Rega Research available since 1977 . It was a belt @-@ drive deck that broke from convention , by employing a solid plinth in lieu of the <unk> @-@ suspended chassis or sub @-@ chassis used in many quality turntables since the early 1960s . 
 The product has lived through several guises and name changes , any of which are often referred to simply as " Rega 3 " . It is highly influential , and has made its small British manufacturer 's name synonymous with hi @-@ fi turntables , and gave the company the widest brand recognition in this product sector in the US . Its relative simplicity and affordability made the Rega 3 a " bedrock of analog playback for well over 30 years " . 
 = = History = = 
 The record player has been through four principal guises : Planar 3 ( 1977 – 2000 ) ( 2016- ) , P3 ( 2000 – 2007 ) , P3 @-@ 24 ( 2007 – 2012 ) and RP3 ( 2012 @-@ 2016 ) . The first Rega turntable , the Planar 2 was launched in 1975 . This was followed by the launch in June 1977 of the Planar 3 . The two decks are of identical design but built to different budgets . The Planar 3 turntable established itself as a " threshold " or entry @-@ level for high quality turntables . It became hugely popular and is one of the most well @-@ known turntables ever produced . A Planar 3 might take centre place in the system of many audiophiles as a " serious turntable " until they could afford the coveted Linn Sondek LP12 . It became a reference for simplicity and value , confirming Britain as an important player in the specialist hi @-@ fi industry . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Rega went against conventional wisdom of the time , preferring to make their decks lightweight and rigid as a means of controlling unwanted resonances . Their belief was that mass absorbs energy and results in lost music . In other senses , the turntables are deliberately minimalistic and neither require nor justify any ' tweaking ' by users , except adjustment to the vertical @-@ tracking @-@ angle ( VTA ) of the cartridge . It is a belt @-@ driven design incorporating a driving ' sub @-@ platter ' mounted in a high quality oil @-@ lubricated bearing , which is fixed directly to a medite ( MDF ) plinth supported by three simple rubber feet . A heavy glass platter sits atop the sub @-@ platter , which is driven by a mechanically @-@ isolated 24V synchronous motor through a rubber belt . A 2mm @-@ thick mat sits on top of the glass platter . The turntable is without suspension , and the rubber feet provide limited mechanical isolation from floor @-@ transmitted vibrations . A perspex cover is provided for some isolation against airborne vibrations . The record deck is single speed – it runs at 33 rpm , and the user must physically remove the platter to reposition the drive belt to play 45 rpm records . 
 The two major changes to the Planar 3 during its life were firstly the inclusion of the higher quality Rega RB300 tonearm in the 1980s , and the change to a new AC synchronous motor more recently . The motor , which had been tuned for lower vibration , allowed for the elimination of the old motor 's compliant mounting . 
 = = = = ' RB ' tonearms = = = = 
 The Planar 3 comes factory @-@ fitted with a RB300 tonearm whose one @-@ piece die @-@ cast aluminium @-@ alloy tube is the core of all Rega arms . It has higher @-@ tolerance bearings , a decoupled counterweight , a coil @-@ spring – type tracking force adjustment , and higher @-@ quality interconnect cables compared to the <unk> fitted to the Planar 2 . The P3 @-@ 24 , ( launched in 2007 ) was fitted with a <unk> , which had a new anti @-@ skate mechanism , external tonearm cable , an improved vertical bearing and a new three @-@ point attachment to the plinth instead of a single pillar . 
 Considered by some to be classics , the Rega tonearms are regarded as offering high value by many reviewers , in the context of the price of the deck . Its high price – performance ratio made the RB300 popular for use with other manufacturers ' decks , including , for example , the Linn Sondek . It earned its place as the most widely used OEM tonearm on the market . 
 = = = Comparison with Planar 2 / P2 = = = 
 The Planar 2 was supplied with a <unk> tonearm as against a RB300 on the Planar 3 , and is available only in black finish . Earlier models had a glass platter , wood surround @-@ frame plinth and S @-@ shaped arm ; Rega changed to using a fibreboard platter on the P2 which it describes as being " CNC machined HDF which is then <unk> [ sic ] , giving a platter with good mass and accuracy . " Compared to the Planar 2 , the Rega Planar 3 has a thicker , heavier plinth ; the drive motor is mounted on the plinth using a rubber suspension for improved isolation . The glass platter is also thicker , as is the felt mat . 
 In 2003 , Lim Juan of The Star speculated that the revised P2 looked " a lot less substantial than its ancestor " , because of cost @-@ cutting . Whilst the platter of the costlier Rega decks , P3 and <unk> , continued to be of glass , reviewers derided the fibreboard platter of the P2 as " not inspiring much confidence " . The plinth , which the Rega website described as a low mass particulate core sandwiched by highly rigid phenolic laminates , " looks like any plain cheap medite board " , according to Lim . The badly @-@ <unk> medite platter proved unpopular with prospective buyers so Rega reverted to glass platters for a while , until the P2 was discontinued in 2005 . 
 On the discontinuation of the P2 , the P3 became Rega 's entry @-@ level record player until the company relaunched the P1 in 2006 ( at $ 350 including arm and cartridge ) to compete with offerings from Music Hall and Pro @-@ <unk> . In late 2006 / early 2007 , the P2 was resurrected once again , with different platter – thicker than before at 22mm , and weightier . When giving their verdicts , audio reviewers often advised readers to pay a little extra for the P3 over the P2 . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 The Rega Planar 3 was updated and renamed the P3 in 2000 , and started being made available in a range of bright colours . The P3 @-@ 24 , in the name of the 24 @-@ pole AC synchronous motor used – same for the costlier P5 and P7 decks , was released ( in 2007 ) . A separate power supply drives the " very low vibration " motor directly mounted on the table . The P3 @-@ 24 may be used with an optional external power supply designed for the P7 that gives a stable voltage to drive the motor and which allows for two @-@ speed operation ( 33 and 45 rpm ) without requiring manual speed change . The plinth of the P3 @-@ 24 and more recent models , constructed of laminates with a <unk> phenolic resin skin instead of MDF , is custom @-@ made by a Scottish kitchen cabinet supplier . 
 In superseding the Rega P3 @-@ 24 with the RP3 , Rega made improvements to the bearing , arm , and plinth . Rega co @-@ founder and chief designer Roy Gandy realised the plinth could be made lighter if thicker bracing was installed at key points to make the structure stronger and stiffer . It was found that after a 2mm @-@ thick brace was incorporated on the top and bottom of the plinth , the phenolic skin could be dispensed with . The <unk> tonearm fitted to its predecessor was changed to the <unk> , which has a cast alloy tube that offered greater rigidity and better control of resonance .

 Ross at Vinyl Asylum regarded the original Rega 's overall sonic presentation as " much more refined than a typical Dual " ( referring to the Dual 505 ) or similarly priced Japanese record players . He found fault , however , in a number of parameters , such as average transient response , not enough sense of depth , a higher than expected noise floor , and some slurring of musical notes and details – such as individual voices among a small group of singers . 
 In the mid @-@ 1980s , Sam Tellig wrote in Stereophile that the Rega 3 " is a good @-@ sounding turntable and a good value — at the UK price ... it 's a miracle that the Rega sounds as good as it does " compared with the apparently better built Harmon @-@ <unk> <unk> . From a sound quality viewpoint , Tellig noted " a very dynamic sound with powerful , punchy bass — the table conveys the music 's excitement ... [ but with ] too much emphasis of the mid- to upper @-@ bass [ and ] tends to sound a little muddy in bass detail " . He added that the deck 's pitch instability was audible " every so often , particularly with woodwinds " . <unk> , in Stereo Times , also agreed that musical expressiveness was the classic Planar 3 strength ; its weaknesses included occasional speed inconsistency and slurring of heavily modulated bass transients . 
 HiFi Choice said in 1984 that the Planar 3 sounded " nicely musical in a balanced and coherent manner . Presentation of detail was considered well above average " ; in 1992 it asserted that the Rega Planar 3 has been " a long time leader " under £ 250 . Michael <unk> wrote in December 1996 that " while the 2 did nothing really wrong , the 3 offered somewhat deeper and tighter bass , better dynamics at both ends of the scale , a better sensation of ' quiet ' , and smoother overall performance " . Considered on its own terms , the Rega 3 was " quiet , dynamic , free of obvious tracking distortion or other supposed analog problems , extremely well @-@ balanced top to bottom , offers very deep and reasonably tight bass " .

 = Shades of Gray ( Star Trek : The Next Generation ) = 
 " Shades of Gray " is the 22nd episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : The Next Generation , the 48th episode overall . It was originally broadcast on July 17 , 1989 , in broadcast syndication . It was the only clip show filmed during the series and was created due to a lack of funds left over from other episodes during the season . Set in the 24th century , the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Federation starship Enterprise . In this episode , Commander William Riker ( Jonathan Frakes ) undergoes medical treatment by Dr. Katherine Pulaski ( Diana Muldaur ) for an alien infection and must relive numerous past events . 
 It was the final episode written by Maurice Hurley , who originated the idea and wrote the first draft of the script , with Hans Beimler and Richard Manning conducting re @-@ writes . It was directed by Rob Bowman and the framework sequences were filmed over the course of three days . It was watched by 9 @.@ 8 million viewers on the first broadcast , the highest ratings for the series since " Samaritan Snare " two months earlier . " Shades of Gray " is widely regarded as the worst episode of the series , with critics calling it " god @-@ awful " and a " travesty " ; even Hurley referred to it negatively . It can be compared to " Spock 's Brain " in The Original Series .

 During a geological survey on <unk> IV , Commander William Riker ( Jonathan Frakes ) is struck by a thorn growing on a motile vine plant . The away team immediately beams back to the Enterprise , where Dr. Katherine Pulaski ( Diana Muldaur ) finds out that the thorn has released a deadly virus into Riker 's body . Within a matter of hours , the virus will reach Riker 's brain , killing him . To try to save Riker 's life , Pulaski puts him into a machine that will artificially stimulate his brain neurons , keeping them active and resisting the virus . This causes Riker to dream of his past adventures aboard the Enterprise . Riker 's first dreams are of reasonably neutral occasions , such as his first meeting with Lieutenant Commander Data ( Brent Spiner ) . He soon moves on to more passionate and even erotic dreams , such as meeting the cheerful young Edo women on Rubicon III , the matriarch Beata ( Karen Montgomery ) on Angel One , or the computer @-@ generated holodeck woman Minuet ( Carolyn McCormick ) . 
 However , while pleasing to Riker 's mind , the passionate dreams only worsen Riker 's condition , as the virus feeds on the positive endorphins his brain is creating . Pulaski and Counselor Deanna Troi ( Marina Sirtis ) therefore agree to try to make the machine evoke negative dreams instead . Thus Riker dreams of Lieutenant Tasha Yar 's ( Denise Crosby ) death , or the apparent death of Deanna Troi 's child ( R. J. Williams ) . This has the desired effect , as the negative endorphins drive the virus away , but the endorphins are not strong enough . As a last resort , Pulaski uses the machine to evoke dreams of raw , primitive feelings of fear and survival . Thus Riker dreams of fighting the tar creature Armus ( Mart McChesney ) , the alien @-@ controlled Admiral Gregory Quinn ( Ward Costello ) , and the Klingon officer <unk> ( Brian Thompson ) on board the warship <unk> . Seeing that the raw emotions work best , Pulaski intensifies the dreams to come at a more rapid pace . This finally kills the virus and Riker recovers . 
 = = Production = = 
 The episode was intended to save money at the end of the season by being a bottle episode which featured few additional characters . The only guest star was Colm Meaney as recurring character Chief Miles O 'Brien . The reason was that the show had overspent on the episodes " Elementary , Dear Data " and " Q Who " , and Paramount Studios was holding the series to their overall season budget . It was the last episode on which Maurice Hurley acted as head writer ; he referred to the episode as a " piece of shit " and " terrible , just terrible " . He turned in the idea of a cheap clip show to save money and wrote the first draft of the script , with Richard Manning and Hans Beimler conducting re @-@ writes . 
 Director Rob Bowman initially thought that the episode could be filmed in five days , two less than usual . However , it was actually filmed in three days after pressure from Paramount with two spent only on the sickbay set . He later said that he simply shot the framework for the clips to be added in later , and never saw a final cut of the episode . Production assistant Eric A. Stillwell was responsible for selecting the clips that went into the episode , with 21 different clips included . The prop used on Riker to fight the infection was created from drawings by designer Rick Sternbach . 
 Ron Jones created the music for the episode , including a three note motif to represent the virus which infects Riker . Themes build as the episode progresses , with elements from " Infection Spreads " which is played over the scene between Riker and Troi move into the pieces " Shades of Pleasure " and " Earth Boys Are Easy " which is played over the pleasurable memories . String instructions and flutes are added to " Shades of Sadness " which played over the unhappy memories , before it built to a climax in the intense memories in the pieces " Critical Condition " , " Shades of Conflict " and " Final <unk> " . Several scenes retained the compositions from the episodes , including pieces by Dennis McCarthy , while others by McCarthy were re @-@ composed by Jones .

 " Shades of Gray " was first shown on July 17 , 1989 in broadcast syndication . It was the final episode of the second season and was watched by 9 @.@ 8 million viewers on the first broadcast . It was the highest number of viewers for an episode since " Samaritan Snare " some two months prior . 
 Several reviewers re @-@ watched the episode after the end of the series . Keith DeCandido watched " Shades of Gray " for Tor.com , and admitted that he hadn 't seen the episode since the original broadcast . He said that it was a " trainwreck " and even worse than he remembered , because other shows such as Xena : Warrior Princess and Stargate SG @-@ 1 had since done much better clip shows . DeCandido summed it up by saying that " In all honesty , they ’ d have been better off doing one fewer episode — the season was shortened by the writers strike anyhow — and upping the budget on one of the other 21 . Just an awful , awful episode . " He gave the episode a score of zero out of ten . Zack Handlen reviewed the episode for The A.V. Club , describing the script as " god @-@ awful " and the episode as " forced " . 
 Michelle Erica Green in her review for TrekNation called the storyline " absurdly flimsy " and that the episode " just felt lazy on every level " . She compared it to The Original Series episode " Operation : <unk> ! " and the Voyager episode " Resolutions " for better episodes featuring alien infections . In the list of the five worst Star Trek : The Next Generation compiled by TechRepublic writer Jay Garmon , " Shades of Gray " was listed as the worst . Garmon described it a " travesty " and that the " nicest " thing you could say about the episode was that it was the last time there was a flashback episode in the series and the last appearance of Pulaski . It was also the original choice of worst episode by Empire magazine , but it was decided that it didn 't count as it was a clip show – so " Masks " was chosen instead . 
 The first home media release of " Shades of Gray " was on VHS cassette , appearing on October 12 , 1994 in the United States and Canada . The episode was later included on the Star Trek : The Next Generation season two DVD box set , released in on May 7 , 2002 .

 = PRR 460 = 
 PRR 460 , nicknamed the " Lindbergh Engine " , is a Pennsylvania Railroad E6s steam locomotive now located in the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania , outside of Strasburg , Pennsylvania in the United States . It was built in 1914 and became famous after racing an aircraft to New York City carrying newsreels of Charles Lindbergh 's return to the United States after his transatlantic flight in 1927 . In the late 1930s , No. 460 was operated by the Long Island Rail Road , and the Pennsylvania – Reading Seashore Lines in the early 1950s , before being retired in 1953 . No. 460 is the only surviving locomotive of its class and was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1979 . Since mid @-@ 2010 , 460 has been undergoing restoration at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania . 
 = = Background = = 
 An experimental Model E6 was developed in 1910 and , after two other " sample " locomotives and four years of tests , it was found that the 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 2 Atlantic 's speed equaled that of the larger 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 2 Pacific 's . An additional 80 E6 locomotives were ordered with superheaters and classified as the E6s . 
 = = History = = 
 No. 460 was the last of the E6s model to be built , out of a total of 80 locomotives . From their construction in 1914 until 1920 , the E6s ran mostly on the corridor between New York City and Washington , D.C. After being replaced by the K4s model , the E6s locomotives were relegated to charter services because of their high speed . 
 After returning from Europe and his transatlantic flight on June 11 , 1927 , Charles Lindbergh was promoted to colonel and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross by President Calvin Coolidge . Two rival newsreel companies , who were each vying to be the first to have their films of the ceremony shown in New York theaters , chartered a train and an aircraft , respectively , from Washington to New York City . No. 460 headed up the charter train , pulling only its tender , a baggage car and a passenger car . The train departed Washington at 1 : 14 PM and arrived at the Manhattan Transfer , outside of New York City , 2 hours and 56 minutes later . The final leg , through the tunnels underneath the Hudson River , was completed by an electric <unk> . No. 460 averaged 82 @.@ 7 miles per hour ( 133 @.@ 1 km / h ) and attained a maximum speed of 115 miles per hour ( 185 km / h ) . Even though the aircraft arrived in New York first , the film brought by No. 460 was in theaters hours before the other , thanks to a film processing lab on board the baggage car . 
 After the race , No. 460 went back to its normal duties until March 1937 , when it was loaned to the Long Island Rail Road . In January 1939 , No. 460 was returned to the Pennsylvania , but was still occasionally used on Long Island as a " short term ' loaner ' " . Starting in 1942 , it hauled trains between Camden and Bay Head , New Jersey . In 1951 , parts were taken of other E6s locomotives that were going to be scrapped : the drivers on the engineer 's ( right ) side are from PRR 1565 , the air reservoir on the fireman 's ( left ) side was from PRR 690 and the reservoir on the engineer 's side was from PRR 782 . 460 's tender was replaced in 1952 with one from 1565 ; the original tender had been transferred to maintenance @-@ of @-@ way service . 460 was leased to the Pennsylvania – Reading Seashore Lines in 1953 before being retired in 1955 and added to the Pennsylvania 's collection of historic locomotives in Northumberland , Pennsylvania . 
 = = = Preservation = = = 
 No. 460 was moved from Northumberland in October 1969 to the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg . Although a part of the museum , it was not owned by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission until it was officially donated to the museum in December 1979 , by the Penn Central Transportation Company , which received ownership when the Pennsylvania was merged with the New York Central Railroad . No. 460 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 17 , 1979 . From 1982 to 1984 , volunteers at the museum cleaned the locomotive , replaced wooden window frames and doors , applied rust inhibitor primer and repainted the metal . The locomotive 's " asbestos lagging " was removed in 2008 . A $ 400 @,@ 000 restoration , lasting 3 to 4 years , is planned and is expected to start once an unrelated project at the museum is completed in the summer of 2011 . 460 was moved into the museum restoration shops on March 17 , 2010 after raising $ 50 @,@ 000 and receiving an additional $ 50 @,@ 000 donation . From July to August 2010 , 460 was " blasted " to remove the several layers of lead paint from the locomotive . The blasting uncovered original timing marks and stamped numbers showing that the origins of some of the parts on 460 were cannibalized from other E6s locomotives .

 " Love , Blactually " is the season premiere of the seventh season of Family Guy . It was written by one of the show 's main voice actors Mike Henry , in his first episode of the season . The episode dealt a lot with the character of Cleveland Brown , which is one of the characters for which Henry provides the voice . The episode was directed by Cyndi Tang , who has been with the show since its fifth season . Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors for the episode . The episode is one of the last to concentrate on the character of Cleveland , since he would be moved to The Cleveland Show ( which Henry co @-@ created ) . 
 " Love , Blactually " , along with the first eight episodes of the seventh season were released on DVD by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment in the United States and Canada on June 16 , 2009 , one month after it had completed broadcast on television . The " Volume 7 " DVD release features bonus material including deleted scenes , animatics , and commentaries for every episode . 
 In addition to the regular cast , actress Kat Foster portrayed the voice of Carolyn , and actress Meredith Baxter portrayed herself .

 = Circular permutation in proteins = 
 A circular permutation is a relationship between proteins whereby the proteins have a changed order of amino acids in their peptide sequence . The result is a protein structure with different connectivity , but overall similar three @-@ dimensional ( 3D ) shape . In 1979 , the first pair of circularly permuted proteins – concanavalin A and lectin – were discovered ; over 2000 such proteins are now known . 
 Circular permutation can occur as the result of evolutionary events , posttranslational modifications , or artificially engineered mutations . The two main models proposed to explain the evolution of circularly permuted proteins are permutation by duplication and fission and fusion . Permutation by duplication occurs when a gene undergoes duplication to form a tandem repeat , before redundant sections of the protein are removed ; this relationship is found between saposin and swaposin . Fission and fusion occurs when partial proteins fuse to form a single polypeptide , such as in nicotinamide nucleotide <unk> . 
 Circular permutations are routinely engineered in the laboratory to improve their catalytic activity or <unk> , or to investigate properties of the original protein . 
 Traditional algorithms for sequence alignment and structure alignment are not able to detect circular permutations between proteins . New non @-@ linear approaches have been developed that overcome this and are able to detect topology @-@ independent similarities . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1979 , Bruce Cunningham and his colleagues discovered the first instance of a circularly permuted protein in nature . After determining the peptide sequence of the lectin protein <unk> , they noticed its similarity to a known protein – concanavalin A – except that the ends were circularly permuted . Later work confirmed the circular permutation between the pair and showed that concanavalin A is permuted post @-@ translationally through cleavage and an unusual protein ligation . 
 After the discovery of a natural circularly permuted protein , researchers looked for a way to emulate this process . In 1983 , David Goldenberg and Thomas Creighton were able to create a circularly permuted version of a protein by chemically ligating the termini to create a cyclic protein , then introducing new termini elsewhere using trypsin . In 1989 , <unk> Luger and her colleagues introduced a genetic method for making circular permutations by carefully fragmenting and ligating DNA . This method allowed for permutations to be introduced at arbitrary sites . 
 Despite the early discovery of post @-@ translational circular permutations and the suggestion of a possible genetic mechanism for evolving circular <unk> , it was not until 1995 that the first circularly permuted pair of genes were discovered . <unk> are a class of proteins involved in sphingolipid catabolism and antigen presentation of lipids in humans . Chris Ponting and Robert Russell identified a circularly permuted version of a saposin inserted into plant aspartic proteinase , which they nicknamed swaposin . <unk> and swaposin were the first known case of two natural genes related by a circular permutation . 
 Hundreds of examples of protein pairs related by a circular permutation were subsequently discovered in nature or produced in the laboratory . As of February 2012 , the Circular Permutation Database contains 2 @,@ 238 circularly permuted protein pairs with known structures , and many more are known without structures . The <unk> database collects proteins that are cyclic , some of which are permuted variants of cyclic wild @-@ type proteins . <unk> is a database that contains a collection of hand @-@ curated manual alignments of proteins with non @-@ trivial relationships , several of which have circular permutations . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 There are two main models that are currently being used to explain the evolution of circularly permuted proteins : permutation by duplication and fission and fusion . The two models have compelling examples supporting them , but the relative contribution of each model in evolution is still under debate . Other , less common , mechanisms have been proposed , such as " cut and paste " or " exon shuffling " . 
 = = = Permutation by duplication = = = 
 The earliest model proposed for the evolution of circular permutations is the permutation by duplication mechanism . In this model , a precursor gene first undergoes a duplication and fusion to form a large tandem repeat . Next , start and stop codons are introduced at corresponding locations in the duplicated gene , removing redundant sections of the protein . 
 One surprising prediction of the permutation by duplication mechanism is that intermediate permutations can occur . For instance , the duplicated version of the protein should still be functional , since otherwise evolution would quickly select against such proteins . Likewise , partially duplicated intermediates where only one terminus was truncated should be functional . Such intermediates have been extensively documented in protein families such as DNA <unk> . 
 = = = = <unk> and swaposin = = = = 
 An example for permutation by duplication is the relationship between saposin and swaposin . <unk> are highly conserved glycoproteins , approximately 80 amino acid residues long and forming a four alpha helical structure . They have a nearly identical placement of cysteine residues and glycosylation sites . The cDNA sequence that codes for saposin is called <unk> . It is a precursor for four cleavage products , the <unk> A , B , C , and D. The four saposin domains most likely arose from two tandem duplications of an ancestral gene . This repeat suggests a mechanism for the evolution of the relationship with the plant @-@ specific insert ( PSI ) . The PSI is a domain exclusively found in plants , consisting of approximately 100 residues and found in plant aspartic proteases . It belongs to the saposin @-@ like protein family ( <unk> ) and has the N- and C- termini " swapped " , such that the order of helices is 3 @-@ 4 @-@ 1 @-@ 2 compared with saposin , thus leading to the name " swaposin " . 
 = = = Fission and fusion = = = 
 Another model for the evolution of circular permutations is the fission and fusion model . The process starts with two partial proteins . These may represent two independent polypeptides ( such as two parts of a heterodimer ) , or may have originally been halves of a single protein that underwent a fission event to become two polypeptides . 
 The two proteins can later fuse together to form a single polypeptide . Regardless of which protein comes first , this fusion protein may show similar function . Thus , if a fusion between two proteins occurs twice in evolution ( either between <unk> within the same species or between <unk> in different species ) but in a different order , the resulting fusion proteins will be related by a circular permutation . 
 Evidence for a particular protein having evolved by a fission and fusion mechanism can be provided by observing the halves of the permutation as independent polypeptides in related species , or by demonstrating experimentally that the two halves can function as separate polypeptides . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 An example for the fission and fusion mechanism can be found in nicotinamide nucleotide <unk> . These are membrane @-@ bound enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a hydride ion between NAD ( H ) and NADP ( H ) in a reaction that is coupled to transmembrane proton translocation . They consist of three major functional units ( I , II , and III ) that can be found in different arrangement in bacteria , protozoa , and higher eukaryotes . Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the three groups of domain arrangements were acquired and fused independently . 
 = = = Other processes that can lead to circular permutations = = = 
 = = = = Post @-@ translational modification = = = = 
 The two evolutionary models mentioned above describe ways in which genes may be circularly permuted , resulting in a circularly permuted mRNA after transcription . Proteins can also be circularly permuted via post @-@ translational modification , without permuting the underlying gene . Circular permutations can happen spontaneously through autocatalysis , as in the case of concanavalin A. Alternately , permutation may require restriction enzymes and ligases . 
 = = The role of circular permutations in protein engineering = = 
 Many proteins have their termini located close together in 3D space . Because of this , it is often possible to design circular permutations of proteins . Today , circular permutations are generated routinely in the lab using standard genetics techniques . Although some permutation sites prevent the protein from folding correctly , many <unk> have been created with nearly identical structure and function to the original protein . 
 The motivation for creating a circular <unk> of a protein can vary . Scientists may want to improve some property of the protein , such as : 
 Reduce proteolytic susceptibility . The rate at which proteins are broken down can have a large impact on their activity in cells . Since termini are often accessible to proteases , designing a circularly permuted protein with less @-@ accessible termini can increase the lifespan of that protein in the cell . 
 Improve catalytic activity . Circularly permuting a protein can sometimes increase the rate at which it catalyzes a chemical reaction , leading to more efficient proteins . 
 Alter substrate or ligand binding . Circularly permuting a protein can result in the loss of substrate binding , but can occasionally lead to novel ligand binding activity or altered substrate specificity . 
 Improve <unk> . Making proteins active over a wider range of temperatures and conditions can improve their utility . 
 Alternately , scientists may be interested in properties of the original protein , such as : 
 Fold order . Determining the order in which different parts of a protein fold is challenging due to the extremely fast time scales involved . Circularly permuted versions of proteins will often fold in a different order , providing information about the folding of the original protein . 
 Essential structural elements . Artificial circularly permuted proteins can allow parts of a protein to be selectively deleted . This gives insight into which structural elements are essential or not . 
 <unk> quaternary structure . Circularly permuted proteins have been shown to take on different quaternary structure than wild @-@ type proteins . 
 Find insertion sites for other proteins . Inserting one protein as a domain into another protein can be useful . For instance , inserting calmodulin into green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) allowed researchers to measure the activity of calmodulin via the fluorescence of the split @-@ GFP . Regions of GFP that tolerate the introduction of circular permutation are more likely to accept the addition of another protein while retaining the function of both proteins . 
 Design of novel biocatalysts and biosensors . Introducing circular permutations can be used to design proteins to catalyze specific chemical reactions , or to detect the presence of certain molecules using proteins . For instance , the GFP @-@ calmodulin fusion described above can be used to detect the level of calcium ions in a sample . 
 = = Algorithmic detection of circular permutations = = 
 Many sequence alignment and protein structure alignment algorithms have been developed assuming linear data representations and as such are not able to detect circular permutations between proteins . Two examples of frequently used methods that have problems correctly aligning proteins related by circular permutation are dynamic programming and many hidden Markov models . As an alternative to these , a number of algorithms are built on top of non @-@ linear approaches and are able to detect topology @-@ independent similarities , or employ modifications allowing them to circumvent the limitations of dynamic programming . The table below is a collection of such methods . 
 The algorithms are classified according to the type of input they require . Sequence @-@ based algorithms require only the sequence of two proteins in order to create an alignment . Sequence methods are generally fast and suitable for searching whole genomes for circularly permuted pairs of proteins . Structure @-@ based methods require 3D structures of both proteins being considered . They are often slower than sequence @-@ based methods , but are able to detect circular permutations between distantly related proteins with low sequence similarity . Some structural methods are topology independent , meaning that they are also able to detect more complex rearrangements than circular permutation . 
 = 1939 California tropical storm = 
 The 1939 California tropical storm , also called the 1939 Long Beach tropical storm , El <unk> , The Lash of St. Francis was a tropical cyclone that hit Southern California in September , 1939 . Formerly a hurricane , it was the only tropical storm to make landfall in California in the twentieth century . The only other known tropical cyclone to directly affect California is the 1858 San Diego Hurricane , and only three other eastern Pacific tropical cyclones have caused gale @-@ force winds in the continental United States . The tropical storm caused heavy flooding , leaving many dead , mostly at sea . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On September 15 , a tropical depression formed off the coast of Central America . It moved west @-@ northwest , passing southwest of the Revillagigedo Islands . It then turned north and then north @-@ eastward . For some time , it was a hurricane , and it lost that intensity on or just before September 25 . The tropical storm made landfall near San Pedro , California early on September 25 with winds of severe gale strength . It dissipated later that day . The strongest reported wind was of Force 11 , reported by a ship , making this system a minimal hurricane . The lowest pressure was reported by the same ship and was 28 @.@ 67 inHg ( 971 mb ) . 
 Due to the rotation of the Earth , tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere tend to move from east to west . This causes tropical cyclones to approach the West Coast of the United States infrequently . Another inhibiting factor for a California landfall is the water temperatures . Because of the water currents , the waters off California are rarely above 70 ° F ( 21 ° C ) , which is too cold for hurricanes to sustain themselves . This tropical cyclone was rare enough that only three other eastern Pacific tropical cyclones brought tropical storm @-@ force winds to the Continental United States during the twentieth century . The Long Beach Tropical Storm was the only one to make landfall ; the other three hit Mexico before moving north .

 The storm dropped heavy rain on California , with 5 @.@ 66 inches ( 144 mm ) falling in Los Angeles ( 5 @.@ 24 inches in 24 hours ) and 11 @.@ 60 inches ( 295 mm ) recorded at Mount Wilson , both September records . Over three hours , one thunderstorm dropped nearly 7 inches ( 180 mm ) of rain on Indio . 9 @.@ 65 inches fell on <unk> Flat , and 1 @.@ 51 inches ( 38 mm ) on Palm Springs . 4 @.@ 83 inches fell on Pasadena , a September record at the time . At the Citrus Belt near Anaheim , at least 4 @.@ 63 inches of rain fell . The 11 @.@ 60 inches ( 295 mm ) at Mount Wilson is one of California 's highest rainfall amounts from a tropical cyclone , although at least one system has a higher point maximum . The rains caused a flood 2 to 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) deep in the Coachella Valley , although some of this may be attributable to a rainstorm dropping 6 @.@ 45 inches ( 164 mm ) the day before the storm hit . The Los Angeles River , which was usually low during September , became a raging torrent . 
 The flooding killed 45 in Southern California , although some of these may be attributable to the rain immediately before the tropical storm . At sea , 48 were killed . The National Hurricane Center only attributes 45 deaths to this system . Six people caught on beaches drowned during the storm . Most other deaths were at sea . Twenty @-@ four died aboard a vessel called the Spray as it attempted to dock at Point Mugu . The two survivors , a man and a woman , swam ashore and then walked five miles ( 8 km ) to Oxnard . Fifteen people from Ventura drowned aboard a fishing boat called the <unk> . Many other vessels were sunk , capsized , or blown ashore . 
 Many low @-@ lying areas were flooded . The Hamilton Bowl overflowed , flooding the Signal Hill area . Along the shore from Malibu to Huntington Beach houses were flooded . Throughout the area , thousands of people were stranded in their homes . Streets in Los Angeles proper were covered with water , flooding buildings and stalling cars . Flooding in Inglewood and Los Angeles reached a depth of 2 to 3 feet . Construction on a flood control project in the Los Angeles River 's channel by the Army Corps of Engineers was stopped by the flooding . In Long Beach windows throughout that city were smashed by the wind . At Belmont Shore , waves undermined ten homes before washing them away . Debris was scattered throughout the coast . Agriculture was disrupted . Crop damage in the Coachella Valley reached 75 % . 
 Rains washed away a 150 @-@ foot ( 46 m ) section of the Southern Pacific Railroad near Indio , and a stretch of the Santa Fe main line near Needles . Waters backing up from a storm drain under construction in the Santa Monica Valley blocked U.S. Route 6 in California . The pier at Point Mugu was washed away . In Pasadena , 5000 people were left without electricity and 2000 telephones lost service . Communications throughout the affected area was disrupted or rendered impossible . The total amount of damage was $ 2 million ( 1939 USD , $ 26 @.@ 2 million 2005 USD ) . 
 The tropical storm was credited with at least one beneficial effect : it ended a vicious heat wave that had lasted for over a week and killed at least 90 people . 
 People were caught unprepared by the storm , which was described as " sudden " . Some people were still on the beach at Long Beach when the wind reached 40 miles per hour , at which time lifeguards closed the beach . Schools were closed there . At sea , the Coast Guard and Navy conducted rescue operations , saving dozens of people . In response to Californians ' unpreparedness , the Weather Bureau established a forecast office for southern California , which began operations in February 1940 . 
 = William de Chesney = 
 William de Chesney ( flourished 1142 – 1161 ) was an Anglo @-@ Norman magnate during the reign of King Stephen of England ( reigned 1135 – 1154 ) and King Henry II of England ( reigned 1154 – 1189 ) . Chesney was part of a large family ; one of his brothers became Bishop of Lincoln and another Abbot of Evesham Abbey . Stephen may have named him Sheriff of Oxfordshire . Besides his administrative offices , Chesney controlled a number of royal castles , and served Stephen during some of the king 's English military campaigns . Chesney 's heir was his niece , Matilda , who married Henry fitzGerold . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following King Henry I 's death in 1135 , the succession was disputed between the Henry 's nephews — Stephen and his elder brother , Theobald II , Count of Champagne — and Henry 's surviving legitimate child Matilda , usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the Holy Roman Emperor , Henry V. Matilda 's brother , and King Henry 's only legitimate son , William died in 1120 , leaving Matilda as Henry 's only legitimate offspring . After Matilda was widowed in 1125 , she returned to England , where her father married her to Geoffrey , Count of Anjou . All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry 's heir , but when Henry I died in 1135 , Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned before either Theobald or Matilda could react . The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy , and Theobald acquiesced to his brother 's usurpation . 
 Matilda , though , was not reconciled to losing the throne , and secured the support of the Scottish king , David , who was her maternal uncle . In 1138 she also secured the support of her half @-@ brother , Robert of Gloucester the Earl of Gloucester , an illegitimate son of Henry I. Most of the reign of King Stephen was dominated by the efforts of Matilda and later her son , Henry of Anjou to oust Stephen from the throne . The height of the civil war was from 1142 to 1148 , but it began in 1138 when Robert of Gloucester declared for Matilda , after previously supporting Stephen . Traditionally , historians have referred to the period of civil war as " The Anarchy " , but recent scholarship has rejected the extreme view of the time period as lawless ; most historians see the reign as disordered but not highly so , and Stephen as weak but not useless . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Chesney was the son of Roger de Chesney and Alice de Langetot . The elder Chesney came from near <unk> @-@ <unk> in the Calvados region of Normandy , and held lands in England from Robert d 'Oilly at the time of the Domesday Survey in 1087 . Alice was the daughter of Ralph de Langetot , who held lands of Walter Giffard at the time of Domesday . William 's brother Robert de Chesney later became Bishop of Lincoln . His other siblings were Reginald , who later became abbot of Evesham Abbey , Hugh , Ralph , <unk> , Beatrice , Isabel , and Roger . Chesney was the uncle of Gilbert Foliot who became successively abbot of Gloucester Abbey , Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of London . It is likely that it was one of William 's sisters that married Gilbert 's father , although there is no sure evidence of this . Chesney also mentioned as relatives the brothers Alexander de Chesney and Ralph de Chesney , but the exact relationship is unknown . Chesney needs to be distinguished from another William de Chesney , who held the office of Sheriff of Norfolk between 1146 and 1153 . 
 = = Career = = 
 William and his brother Roger de Chesney were leading supporters of King Stephen in 1141 , and were both leaders in Stephen 's army that gathered at Winchester . In 1143 , William de Chesney was given control of the town and royal castle at Oxford . He also held the town and castle of Deddington , which he had acquired at least by 1157 , and possibly earlier . Although he did not begin the fortifications at Deddington Castle , it is likely that he began the first stone defences at the site . Deddington was Chesney 's most important holding in Oxfordshire , and the basis of his power in the county . 
 Before he controlled Deddington , Chesney temporarily administered the lands of Robert d 'Oilly , who had previously held Oxford Castle but had defected to the side of the Empress Matilda in 1141 and died a year later . D 'Oilly 's heir took refuge with Matilda when Stephen overran his lands two weeks after his father 's death , leading to Chesney 's control of the d 'Oilly lands . Some historians have seen this holding of the lands as Stephen giving Chesney the d 'Oilly barony , but the only evidence for this is that Chesney eventually owned a manor previously belonging to d 'Oilly which does not necessarily mean that he received the whole barony . It is far more likely that Stephen gave Chesney parts of the lands of William fitzOsbern , which had reverted to the king in 1075 . Most of the known lands of fitzOsbern are known to have been owned by Chesney or by tenants who held the lands from him . 
 Historians are divided in their views as to whether Chesney held the office of Sheriff of Oxfordshire . Whatever the exact office that Chesney held in Oxfordshire , the townsmen of Oxford referred to him as their " alderman " before such honorifics were in common use . 
 In 1145 , Chesney was forced to ask Stephen for help in fending off the approach of Philip , a younger son of Robert , Earl of Gloucester , who was threatening Chesney 's control of Oxford . During the period 1142 – 1148 Chesney forced Gloucester Abbey , then under the abbacy of his nephew Gilbert Foliot , to pay him sums of money . Foliot , in one of his surviving letters , reprimanded his uncle for his behaviour , asking him " Which of God 's poor around you have you not harmed ? " In 1147 , Chesney granted the island of Medley to Osney Abbey in the name of his father and brother Roger , as well as King Stephen , Queen Matilda and their son Eustace . After 1148 , Chesney apparently began to hedge his bets as he appears in the company of Roger of Hereford , the Earl of Hereford , who was a firm supporter of Matilda 's and her son Henry 's cause . 
 Chesney served again as the leader of Stephen 's army at Wallingford Castle in 1153 and in August he was defeated by Henry of Anjou . The subsequent peace settlement , the Treaty of Wallingford , gave Henry the English throne after Stephen 's death . A part of the treaty awarded control of Oxford Castle to Roger de Bussy . Although Chesney had lost control of the castle , none of his lands were confiscated . Early in 1154 , Chesney was with Henry , as he was a witness on two charters of Henry 's . After Henry 's ascension to the throne , Chesney came to terms with the new king , and received confirmation of his lands from the king by 1157 . He spent time in Normandy with Henry from 1159 through to 1161 . He continued to receive favours from the king , such as exemption for payment of danegeld on his manor of Deddington in 1156 . 
 Chesney married Margaret de Lucy , who was probably a relative of Richard de Lucy , another of Stephen 's main supporters . He died sometime between 1172 and 1176 . Chesney 's heir was his niece Matilda , whom King Henry II married to Henry fitzGerold , a royal chamberlain . 
 = Xenu = 
 Xenu ( / <unk> / ) , also called Xemu , was , according to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard , the dictator of the " Galactic Confederacy " who 75 million years ago brought billions of his people to Earth ( then known as " Teegeeack " ) in a DC @-@ 8 @-@ like spacecraft , stacked them around volcanoes , and killed them with hydrogen bombs . Official Scientology scriptures hold that the thetans ( immortal spirits ) of these aliens adhere to humans , causing spiritual harm . 
 These events are known within Scientology as " Incident II " , and the traumatic memories associated with them as " The Wall of Fire " or " R6 implant " . The narrative of Xenu is part of Scientologist teachings about extraterrestrial civilizations and alien interventions in earthly events , collectively described as " space opera " by Hubbard . Hubbard detailed the story in Operating Thetan level III ( OT III ) in 1967 , warning that the " R6 implant " ( past trauma ) was " calculated to kill ( by pneumonia , etc . ) anyone who attempts to solve it " . 
 Within the Church of Scientology , the Xenu story is part of the church 's secret " Advanced Technology " , considered a sacred and esoteric teaching , which is normally only revealed to members who have completed a lengthy sequence of courses costing large amounts of money . The church avoids mention of Xenu in public statements and has gone to considerable effort to maintain the story 's confidentiality , including legal action on the grounds of copyright and trade secrecy . Officials of the Church of Scientology widely deny or try to hide the Xenu story . Despite this , much material on Xenu has leaked to the public via court documents , copies of Hubbard 's notes , and the Internet . In commentary on the impact of the Xenu text , academic scholars have discussed and analyzed the writings by Hubbard and their place within Scientology within the contexts of science fiction , UFO religions , Gnosticism and creation myths . 
 = = Summary = = 
 The story of Xenu is covered in OT III , part of Scientology 's secret " Advanced Technology " doctrines taught only to advanced members who have undergone many hours of auditing and reached the state of Clear followed by Operating Thetan levels 1 and 2 . It is described in more detail in the accompanying confidential " Assists " lecture of October 3 , 1968 , and is dramatized in Revolt in the Stars ( a screen @-@ story -- in the form of a novel -- written by L. Ron Hubbard in 1977 ) . 
 Hubbard wrote that Xenu was the ruler of a Galactic Confederacy 75 million years ago , which consisted of 26 stars and 76 planets including Earth , which was then known as " Teegeeack " . The planets were overpopulated , containing an average population of 178 billion . The Galactic Confederacy 's civilization was comparable to our own , with aliens " walking around in clothes which looked very remarkably like the clothes they wear this very minute " and using cars , trains and boats looking exactly the same as those " circa 1950 , 1960 " on Earth . 
 Xenu was about to be deposed from power , so he devised a plot to eliminate the excess population from his dominions . With the assistance of psychiatrists , he gathered billions of his citizens under the pretense of income tax inspections , then paralyzed them and froze them in a mixture of alcohol and glycol to capture their souls . The kidnapped populace was loaded into spacecraft for transport to the site of extermination , the planet of Teegeeack ( Earth ) . The appearance of these spacecraft would later be subconsciously expressed in the design of the Douglas DC @-@ 8 , the only difference being that " the <unk> had fans , propellers on it and the space plane didn 't " . When they had reached Teegeeack , the paralyzed citizens were unloaded around the bases of volcanoes across the planet . Hydrogen bombs were then lowered into the volcanoes and detonated simultaneously , killing all but a few aliens . Hubbard described the scene in his film script , Revolt in the Stars : 
 Simultaneously , the planted charges erupted . Atomic blasts ballooned from the craters of Loa , Vesuvius , Shasta , Washington , Fujiyama , Etna , and many , many others . <unk> higher and higher , up and outwards , towering clouds mushroomed , shot through with flashes of flame , waste and fission . Great winds raced tumultuously across the face of Earth , spreading tales of destruction ... 
 The now @-@ disembodied victims ' souls , which Hubbard called thetans , were blown into the air by the blast . They were captured by Xenu 's forces using an " electronic ribbon " ( " which also was a type of standing wave " ) and sucked into " vacuum zones " around the world . The hundreds of billions of captured thetans were taken to a type of cinema , where they were forced to watch a " three @-@ D , super colossal motion picture " for thirty @-@ six days . This implanted what Hubbard termed " various misleading data " ' ( collectively termed the R6 implant ) into the memories of the hapless thetans , " which has to do with God , the Devil , space opera , etcetera " . This included all world religions ; Hubbard specifically attributed Roman Catholicism and the image of the Crucifixion to the influence of Xenu . The two " implant stations " cited by Hubbard were said to have been located on Hawaii and Las Palmas in the Canary Islands . 
 In addition to implanting new beliefs in the thetans , the images deprived them of their sense of personal identity . When the thetans left the projection areas , they started to cluster together in groups of a few thousand , having lost the ability to differentiate between each other . Each cluster of thetans gathered into one of the few remaining bodies that survived the explosion . These became what are known as body thetans , which are said to be still clinging to and adversely affecting everyone except Scientologists who have performed the necessary steps to remove them . 
 A government faction known as the Loyal Officers finally overthrew Xenu and his renegades , and locked him away in " an electronic mountain trap " from which he has not escaped . Although the location of Xenu is sometimes said to be the Pyrenees on Earth , this is actually the location Hubbard gave elsewhere for an ancient " Martian report station " . Teegeeack was subsequently abandoned by the Galactic Confederacy and remains a pariah " prison planet " to this day , although it has suffered repeatedly from incursions by alien " Invader Forces " since that time . 
 In 1988 , the cost of learning these secrets from the Church of Scientology was £ 3 @,@ 830 , or US $ 6 @,@ 500 . This is in addition to the cost of the prior courses which are necessary to be eligible for OT III , which is often well over US $ 100 @,@ 000 ( roughly £ 60 @,@ 000 ) . Belief in Xenu and body thetans is a requirement for a Scientologist to progress further along the Bridge to Total Freedom . Those who do not experience the benefits of the OT III course are expected to take it and pay for it again . 
 = = Scientology doctrine = = 
 Within Scientology , the Xenu story is referred to as " The Wall of Fire " or " Incident II " . Hubbard attached tremendous importance to it , saying that it constituted " the secrets of a disaster which resulted in the decay of life as we know it in this sector of the galaxy " . The broad outlines of the story — that 75 million years ago a great catastrophe happened in this sector of the galaxy which caused profoundly negative effects for everyone since then — are told to lower @-@ level Scientologists ; but the details are kept strictly confidential , within Scientology . 
 The OT III document describes that Hubbard entered the Wall of Fire but emerged alive ( " probably the only one ever to do so in 75 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 years " ) . He first publicly announced his " breakthrough " in Ron 's Journal 67 ( <unk> ) , a taped lecture recorded on September 20 , 1967 , to be sent to all Scientologists . According to Hubbard , his research was achieved at the cost of a broken back , knee , and arm . OT III contains a warning that the R6 implant is " calculated to kill ( by pneumonia etc . ) anyone who attempts to solve it " . Hubbard claimed that his " tech development " — i.e. his OT materials — had neutralized this threat , creating a safe path to redemption . 
 The Church of Scientology forbade individuals from reading the OT III Xenu cosmogony without first having taken prerequisite courses . Scientologists warn that reading the Xenu story without proper authorization could cause pneumonia . 
 In <unk> , Hubbard then alludes to the devastating effect of Xenu 's genocide : 
 And it is very true that a great catastrophe occurred on this planet and in the other 75 planets which formed this [ Galactic ] Confederacy 75 million years ago . It has since that time been a desert , and it has been the lot of just a handful to try to push its technology up to a level where someone might adventure forward , penetrate the catastrophe , and undo it . We 're well on our way to making this occur . 
 OT III also deals with Incident I , set four quadrillion years ago . In Incident I , the unsuspecting thetan was subjected to a loud snapping noise followed by a flood of luminescence , then saw a chariot followed by a trumpeting cherub . After a loud set of snaps , the thetan was overwhelmed by darkness . It is described that these traumatic memories alone separate thetans from their static ( natural , godlike ) state . 
 Hubbard uses the existence of body thetans to explain many of the physical and mental ailments of humanity which , he says , prevent people from achieving their highest spiritual levels . OT III tells the Scientologist to locate body thetans and release them from the effects of Incidents I and II . This is accomplished in solo auditing , where the Scientologist holds both cans of an E @-@ meter in one hand and asks questions as an auditor . The Scientologist is directed to find a cluster of body thetans , address it telepathically as a cluster , and take first the cluster , then each individual member , through Incident II , then Incident I if needed . Hubbard warns that this is a painstaking procedure , and that OT levels IV to VII are necessary to continue dealing with one 's body thetans . 
 The Church of Scientology has objected to the Xenu story being used to paint Scientology as science fiction fantasy ( see Space opera in Scientology doctrine ) . Hubbard 's statements concerning the R6 implant have been a source of contention . Critics and some Christians state that Hubbard 's statements regarding R6 prove that Scientology doctrine is incompatible with Christianity , despite the Church 's statements to the contrary . In " Assists " , Hubbard says : 
 Everyman is then shown to have been crucified so don 't think that it 's an accident that this crucifixion , they found out that this applied . Somebody somewhere on this planet , back about 600 BC , found some pieces of R6 , and I don 't know how they found it , either by watching madmen or something , but since that time they have used it and it became what is known as Christianity . The man on the Cross . There was no Christ . But the man on the cross is shown as Everyman . 
 = = Origins of the story = = 
 Hubbard wrote OT III in late 1966 and early 1967 in North Africa while on his way to Las Palmas to join the Enchanter , the first vessel of his private Scientology fleet ( the " Sea Org " ) . ( OT III says " In December 1967 I knew someone had to take the plunge " , but the material was publicised well before this . ) He emphasized later that OT III was his own personal discovery . 
 Critics of Scientology have suggested that other factors may have been at work . In a letter of the time to his wife Mary Sue , Hubbard said that , in order to assist his research , he was drinking alcohol and taking stimulants and depressants ( " I 'm drinking lots of rum and popping pinks and greys " ) . His assistant at the time , Virginia Downsborough , said that she had to wean him off the diet of drugs to which he had become accustomed . Russell Miller posits in Bare @-@ faced Messiah that it was important for Hubbard to be found in a debilitated condition , so as to present OT III as " a research accomplishment of immense magnitude " . 
 Elements of the Xenu story appeared in Scientology before OT III . Hubbard 's descriptions of extraterrestrial conflicts were put forward as early as 1950 in his book Have You Lived Before This Life ? , and were enthusiastically endorsed by Scientologists who documented their past lives on other planets . 
 = = Influence of OT III on Scientology = = 
 The 1968 and subsequent reprints of Dianetics have had covers depicting an exploding volcano , which is reportedly a reference to OT III . In a 1968 lecture , and in instructions to his marketing staff , Hubbard explained that these images would " key in " the submerged memories of Incident II and impel people to buy the books . 
 A special ' Book Mission ' was sent out to promote these books , now empowered and made irresistible by the addition of these overwhelming symbols or images . Organization staff were assured that if they simply held up one of the books , revealing its cover , that any bookstore owner would immediately order <unk> of them . A customs officer , seeing any of the book covers in one 's luggage , would immediately pass one on through . 
 Since the 1980s , the volcano has also been depicted in television commercials advertising Dianetics . Scientology 's " Sea Org " , an elite group within the church that originated with Hubbard 's personal staff aboard his fleet of ships , takes many of its symbols from the story of Xenu and OT III . It is explicitly intended to be a revival of the " Loyal Officers " who overthrew Xenu . Its logo , a wreath with 26 leaves , represents the 26 stars of Xenu 's Galactic Confederacy . According to an official Scientology dictionary , " the Sea Org symbol , adopted and used as the symbol of a Galactic Confederacy far back in the history of this sector , derives much of its power and authority from that association " . 
 In the Advanced <unk> in Edinburgh and Los Angeles , Scientology staff were at one time ordered to wear all @-@ white uniforms with silver boots , to mimic Xenu 's Galactic Patrol as depicted on the cover of Dianetics : The Evolution of a Science . This was reportedly done on the basis of Hubbard 's declaration in his Flag Order 652 that mankind would accept regulation from that group which had last betrayed it — hence the imitation of Xenu 's henchmen . In Los Angeles , a <unk> was ordered to watch for returning spaceships . 
 = = Name = = 
 The name has been spelled both as Xenu and Xemu . The Class VIII course material includes a three @-@ page text , handwritten by Hubbard , headed " Data " , in which the Xenu story is given in detail . Hubbard 's indistinct handwriting makes either spelling possible , particularly as the use of the name on the first page of OT III is the only known example of the name in his handwriting . In the " Assists " lecture , Hubbard speaks of " Xenu , <unk> , could be spelled X @-@ E @-@ M @-@ U " and clearly says " Xemu " several times on the recording . The treatment of Revolt in the Stars — which is typewritten — uses Xenu exclusively . 
 = = Church of Scientology 's position = = 
 In its public statements , the Church of Scientology has been reluctant to allow any mention of Xenu . A passing mention by a trial judge in 1997 prompted the Church 's lawyers to have the ruling sealed , although this was reversed . In the relatively few instances in which it has acknowledged Xenu , Scientology has stated the story 's true meaning can only be understood after years of study . They complain of critics using it to paint the religion as a science @-@ fiction fantasy . 
 Senior members of the Church of Scientology have several times publicly denied or minimized the importance of the Xenu story , but others have affirmed its existence . In 1995 , Scientology lawyer Earl Cooley hinted at the importance of Xenu in Scientology doctrine by stating that " thousands of articles are written about Coca @-@ Cola , and they don 't print the formula for Coca @-@ Cola " . Scientology has many graduated levels through which one can progress . Many who remain at lower levels in the church are unaware of much of the Xenu story which is first revealed on Operating Thetan level three , or " OT III " . Because the information imparted to members is to be kept secret from others who have not attained that level , the member must publicly deny its existence when asked . OT III recipients must sign an agreement promising never to reveal its contents before they are given the manila envelope containing the Xenu knowledge . It is knowledge so dangerous , members are told , that anyone learning this material before he is ready could become afflicted with pneumonia . 
 Religious Technology Center director Warren McShane testified in a 1995 court case that the Church of Scientology receives a significant amount of its revenue from fixed donations paid by Scientologists to study the OT materials . McShane said that Hubbard 's work " may seem weird " to those that have not yet completed the prior levels of coursework in Scientology . McShane said the story had never been secret , although maintaining there were nevertheless trade secrets contained in OT III . McShane discussed the details of the story at some length and specifically attributed the authorship of the story to Hubbard . 
 When John Carmichael , the president of the Church of Scientology of New York , was asked about the Xenu story , he said , as reported in the September 9 , 2007 , edition of the Daily Telegraph : " That 's not what we believe " . When asked directly about the Xenu story by Ted Koppel on ABC 's Nightline , Scientology leader David Miscavige said that he was taking things Hubbard said out of context . However , in a 2006 interview with Rolling Stone , Mike Rinder , the director of the church 's Office of Special Affairs , said that " It is not a story , it is an auditing level " , when asked about the validity of the Xenu story . 
 In a BBC Panorama programme that aired on May 14 , 2007 , senior Scientologist Tommy Davis interrupted when celebrity members were asked about Xenu , saying : " None of us know what you 're talking about . It 's loony . It 's weird . " In March 2009 , Davis was interviewed by investigative journalist Nathan Baca for <unk> @-@ TV and was again asked about the OT III texts . Davis told Baca " I 'm familiar with the material " , and called it " the confidential scriptures of the Church " . In an interview on ABC News Nightline , October 23 , 2009 , Davis walked off the set when Martin Bashir asked him about Xenu . He told Bashir , " Martin , I am not going to discuss the disgusting perversions of Scientology beliefs that can be found now commonly on the internet and be put in the position of talking about things , talking about things that are so fundamentally offensive to Scientologists to discuss . ... It is in violation of my religious beliefs to talk about them . " When Bashir repeated a question about Xenu , Davis pulled off his microphone and left the set . 
 In November 2009 the Church of Scientology 's representative in New Zealand , Mike Ferris , was asked in a radio interview about Xenu . The radio host asked , " So what you 're saying is , Xenu is a part of the religion , but something that you don 't want to talk about " . Ferris responded , " Sure " . Ferris acknowledged that Xenu " is part of the esoterica of Scientology " . 
 = = Leaking of the story = = 
 Despite the Church of Scientology 's efforts to keep the story secret , details have been leaked over the years . OT III was first revealed in Robert Kaufman 's 1972 book Inside Scientology , in which Kaufman detailed his own experiences of OT III . It was later described in a 1981 Clearwater Sun article , and came to greater public fame in a 1985 court case brought against Scientology by Lawrence Wollersheim . The church failed to have the documents sealed and attempted to keep the case file checked out by a reader at all times , but the story was summarized in the Los Angeles Times and detailed in William Poundstone 's Bigger Secrets ( 1986 ) from information presented in the Wollersheim case . In 1987 , a book by L. Ron Hubbard Jr . , L. Ron Hubbard : Messiah or Madman ? quoted the first page of OT III and summarized the rest of its content . 
 Since then , news media have mentioned Xenu in coverage of Scientology or its celebrity proponents such as Tom Cruise . In 1987 , the BBC 's investigative news series Panorama aired a report entitled " The Road to Total Freedom ? " which featured an outline of the OT III story in cartoon form . 
 On December 24 , 1994 , the Xenu story was published on the Internet for the first time in a posting to the Usenet newsgroup alt.religion.scientology , through an anonymous <unk> . This led to an online battle between Church of Scientology lawyers and detractors . Older versions of OT levels I to VII were brought as exhibits attached to a declaration by Steven Fishman on April 9 , 1993 , as part of Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and <unk> . The text of this declaration and its exhibits , collectively known as the Fishman <unk> , were posted to the Internet newsgroup alt.religion.scientology in August 1995 by Arnie Lerma and on the World Wide Web by David S. <unk> . This was a subject of great controversy and legal battles for several years . There was a copyright raid on Lerma 's house ( leading to massive mirroring of the documents ) and a suit against Dutch writer Karin Spaink — the Church bringing suit on copyright violation grounds for reproducing the source material , and also claiming rewordings would reveal a trade secret . 
 The Church of Scientology 's attempts to keep Xenu under wraps have been cited in court findings against it . In September 2003 , a Dutch court , in a ruling in the case against Karin Spaink , stated that one objective in keeping OT II and OT III secret was to wield power over members of the Church of Scientology and prevent discussion about its teachings and practices : 
 Despite his claims that premature revelation of the OT III story was lethal , L. Ron Hubbard wrote a screenplay version under the title Revolt in the Stars in the 1970s . This revealed that Xenu had been assisted by beings named Chi ( " the Galactic Minister of Police " ) and Chu ( " the Executive President of the Galactic Interplanetary Bank " ) . It has not been officially published , although the treatment was circulated around Hollywood in the early 1980s . Unofficial copies of the screenplay circulate on the Internet . 
 On March 10 , 2001 , a user posted the text of OT3 to the online community Slashdot . The site owners took down the comment after the Church of Scientology issued a legal notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act . Critics of the Church of Scientology have used public protests to spread the Xenu secret . This has included creating web sites with " <unk> " in the domain name , and displaying the name Xenu on banners , and protest signs .

 Versions of the Xenu story have appeared in both television shows and stage productions . The Off @-@ Broadway satirical musical A Very Merry Unauthorized Children 's Scientology Pageant , first staged in 2003 and winner of an Obie Award in 2004 , featured children in alien costumes telling the story of Xenu . 
 The Xenu story was again satirized in a November 2005 episode of the Comedy Central animated television series South Park titled " Trapped in the Closet " . The Emmy @-@ nominated episode , which also lampooned Scientologists Tom Cruise and John Travolta as closeted homosexuals , depicted Xenu as a vaguely humanoid alien with tentacles for arms , in a sequence that had the words " This Is What Scientologists Actually Believe " superimposed on screen . The episode became the subject of controversy when musician Isaac Hayes , the voice of the character " Chef " and a Scientologist , quit the show in March 2006 , just prior to the episode 's first scheduled re @-@ screening , citing South Park 's " inappropriate ridicule " of his religion . Hayes ' statement did not mention the episode in particular , but expressed his view that the show 's habit of parodying religion was part of a " growing insensitivity toward personal spiritual beliefs " in the media that was also reflected in the Muhammad cartoons controversy : " There is a place in this world for satire , but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins . " Responding to Hayes ' statement , South Park co @-@ creator Matt Stone said his resignation had " nothing to do with intolerance and bigotry and everything to do with the fact that Isaac Hayes is a Scientologist and that we recently featured Scientology in an episode of South Park ... In 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park , Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of Christians , Muslims , Mormons and Jews . He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show . Of course we will release Isaac from his contract and we wish him well . " Comedy Central cancelled the repeat at short notice , choosing instead to screen two episodes featuring Hayes . A spokesman said that " in light of the events of earlier this week , we wanted to give Chef an appropriate tribute by airing two episodes he is most known for . " It did eventually rebroadcast the episode on July 19 , 2006 . Stone and South Park co @-@ creator Trey Parker felt that Comedy Central 's owners Viacom had cancelled the repeat because of the upcoming release of the Tom Cruise film Mission : Impossible III by Paramount , another Viacom company : " I only know what we were told , that people involved with <unk> wanted the episode off the air and that is why Comedy Central had to do it . I don 't know why else it would have been pulled . "

 Writing in the book Scientology published by Oxford University Press , contributor Mikael Rothstein observes that , " To my knowledge no real analysis of Scientology 's Xenu myth has appeared in scholarly publications . The most sober and enlightening text about the Xenu myth is probably the article on Wikipedia ( English version ) and , even if brief , Andreas <unk> 's piece on Scientology in Lewis ( 2000 : 266 – 268 ) . " Rothstein places the Xenu text by L. Ron Hubbard within the context of a creation myth within the Scientology methodology , and characterizes it as " one of Scientology 's more important religious narratives , the text that apparently constitutes the basic ( sometimes implicit ) mythology of the movement , the Xenu myth , which is basically a story of the origin of man on Earth and the human condition . " Rothstein describes the phenomenon within a belief system inspired by science fiction , and notes that the " myth about Xenu , ... in the shape of a science fiction @-@ inspired <unk> , explains the basic Scientological claims about the human condition . " 
 Andreas Grünschloß analyzes the Xenu text in The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements , within the context of a discussion on UFO religions . He characterizes the text as " Scientology 's secret mythology ( contained especially in the OT III teachings ) " . Grünschloß points out that L. Ron Hubbard , " also wrote a science fiction story called Revolt in the Stars , where he displays this otherwise arcane story about the ancient ruler Xenu in the form of an ordinary science fiction novel " . Grünschloß posits , " because of the connections between several motifs in Hubbard 's novels and specific Scientology teachings , one might perceive Scientology as one of the rare instances where science fiction ( or fantasy literature generally ) is related to the successful formation of a new spiritual movement . " Comparing the fusion between the two genres of Hubbard 's science fiction writing and Scientology creation myth , Grünschloß writes , " Although the science fiction novels are of a different genre than other ' techno @-@ logical ' disclosures of Hubbard , they are highly appreciated by participants , and Hubbard 's literary output in this realm ( including the latest movie , Battlefield Earth ) is also well promoted by the organization . " Writing in the book UFO Religions edited by Christopher Partridge , Grünschloß observes , " the enthusiasm for ufology and science fiction was cultivated in the formative phase of Scientology . Indeed , even the highly arcane story of the intergalactic ruler Xenu ... is related by Hubbard in the style of a simple science fiction novel " . 
 Several authors have pointed out structural similarities between the Xenu story and the mythology of gnosticism . James A. Herrick , writing about the Xenu text in The Making of the New Spirituality : The Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition , notes that " Hubbard 's gnostic leanings are evident in his account of human origins ... In Hubbard , ideas first expressed in science fiction are seamlessly transformed into a worldwide religion with affinities to gnosticism . " Mary Farrell <unk> , writing in America 's Alternative Religions , similarly states that the outline of the Xenu mythology is " not totally unfamiliar to the historian acquainted with ancient gnosticism " , noting that many other religious traditions have the practice of reserving certain texts to high @-@ level initiates . Nevertheless , she writes , the Xenu story arouses suspicion in the public about Scientology and adds fuel to " the claims that Hubbard 's system is the product of his creativity as a science fiction writer rather than a theologian . " 
 Authors Michael McDowell and Nathan Robert Brown discuss misconceptions about the Xenu text in their book World Religions at Your Fingertips , and observe , " Probably the most controversial , misunderstood , and frequently misrepresented part of the Scientology religion has to do with a Scientology myth commonly referred to as the Legend of Xenu . While this story has now been undoubtedly proven a part of the religion ( despite the fact that church representatives often deny its existence ) , the story 's true role in Scientology is often misrepresented by its critics as proof that they ' believe in alien parasites . ' While the story may indeed seem odd , this is simply not the case . " The authors write that " The story is actually meant to be a working myth , illustrating the Scientology belief that humans were at one time spiritual beings , existing on infinite levels of intergalactic and interdimensional realities . At some point , the beings that we once were became trapped in physical reality ( where we remain to this day ) . This is supposed to be the underlying message of the Xenu story , not that humans are " possessed by aliens " . McDowell and Brown conclude that these inappropriate misconceptions about the Xenu text have had a negative impact , " Such harsh statements are the reason many Scientologists now become passionately offended at even the mention of Xenu by <unk> . " 
 Free speech lawyer Mike Godwin analyzes actions by the Scientology organization to protect and keep secret the Xenu text , within a discussion in his book Cyber Rights about the application of trade secret law on the Internet . Godwin explains , " trade secret law protects the information itself , not merely its particular expression . Trade secret law , unlike copyright , can protect ideas and facts directly . " He puts forth the question , " But did the material really qualify as ' trade secrets ' ? Among the material the church has been trying to suppress is what might be called a ' genesis myth of Scientology ' : a story about a galactic despot named Xenu who decided 75 million years ago to kill a bunch of people by chaining them to volcanoes and dropping nuclear bombs on them . " Godwin asks , " Does a ' church ' normally have ' competitors ' in the trade secret sense ? If the Catholics got hold of the full facts about Xenu , does this mean they 'll get more market share ? " He comments on the ability of the Scientology organization to utilize such laws in order to contain its secret texts , " It seems likely , given what we know about the case now , that even a combination of copyright and trade secret law wouldn 't accomplish what the church would like to accomplish : the total suppression of any dissemination of church documents or doctrines . " The author concludes , " But the fact that the church was unlikely to gain any complete legal victories in its cases didn 't mean that they wouldn 't litigate . It 's indisputable that the mere threat of litigation , or the costs of actual litigation , may accomplish what the legal theories alone do not : the effective silencing of many critics of the church .

 = 827th Tank Destroyer Battalion = 
 The 827th Tank Destroyer Battalion was a tank destroyer battalion of the United States Army active during the Second World War . It was activated in April 1942 as a segregated African American unit , deploying to Europe at the end of 1944 and attached to 12th Armored Division . It saw action during Operation Nordwind in January 1945 , where elements of the battalion performed creditably . However , its overall combat record was marred by severe disciplinary problems and insufficient training . It was withdrawn in February , and assigned to rear @-@ area duties ; while it nominally remained active for the remainder of the war , it had been effectively disbanded . 
 = = Background = = 
 The US Army 's basic wartime racial policy , established in 1937 , dictated that both whites and African Americans were to be inducted into the Army in equal proportions and strength , but that they were to be assigned to segregated units . Black soldiers could be led by white officers , but not vice versa , and unit composition was to be strictly controlled by the War Department . The mix of combat and support service units was , in theory , to be roughly equal between both groups . This caused tension between the Department and operational commanders , with the latter generally unwilling to provide places for black combat units . In practice , almost all combat units in the pre @-@ war period were white . 
 In response to growing pressure for a more equal distribution , the White House issued a statement in October 1940 which , while reaffirming segregation , provided that , " Negro organizations will be established in each major branch of the service " . The first black armored units , which had been a matter of great public interest , were activated in early 1941 . Two black tank destroyer units were formed that December , as tank destroyer battalions were treated as a separate arm of service . A further five were activated in 1942 , and four ( in addition to two planned , but later canceled ) in 1943 . 
 = = Early service = = 
 The 827th Tank Destroyer Battalion was activated on April 20 , 1942 , at Camp Forrest , Tennessee , one of five such battalions created that year . Initially armed with 75 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) M3 GMC half @-@ tracks , it later received the self @-@ propelled M10 tank destroyer before being reorganized as a towed battalion , equipped with trucks and 3 " anti @-@ tank guns . It finally returned to a self @-@ propelled unit , equipped with M18 Hellcats . At no point during this constant reshuffling did the unit ever receive a full allocation of equipment . At the same time , the original officer cadre was replaced twice — first with black officers , then with white officers from other disbanded segregated battalions . By the time the battalion sailed overseas , it had seen eight separate commanding officers . 
 The unit emerged from these repeated reorganizations in very poor state ; training was inadequate , with the unit repeatedly failing battalion competence tests , and some areas of combat training — notably indirect fire — were avoided altogether . Discipline and order within the unit was equally low — in September 1944 , the battalion held two courts @-@ <unk> for murder . The situation was so dire that the battalion 's commander felt it was likely that he would oversee the disbanding of the battalion or its conversion into a non @-@ combat service unit ( the latter of which had already happened to a number of other segregated tank destroyer battalions ) . 
 The 827th was originally scheduled to be sent to the Pacific theater , but in February , 1944 , it was declared insufficiently trained and held back for further preparation ; a different unit was substituted at the last minute . The next six months did not show great improvement in quality , but nonetheless the battalion was eventually sent overseas . It arrived in Marseille in late 1944 , deploying to the front in December , attached to the 12th Armored Division . 
 = = Combat = = 
 The first portion of the 827th to be deployed for combat was a single company in support of the 714th Tank Battalion of the 12th Armored Division , on 20 December 1944 . Failing to see action , the company was withdrawn to reserve after three days on the line . Discipline proved to be a problem during this period , with men abandoning their guns to collect firewood , despite assistance and advice from the <unk> Tank Destroyer Battalion ( an experienced and well @-@ regarded black unit operating in the same area ) . A second company was used for screening purposes in the first week of January , also not seeing combat , while the remainder of the battalion narrowly avoided being assigned to an indirect @-@ fire role it was completely unprepared for . 
 On 6 January , the battalion while still attached to the 12th Armored Division , was assigned to participate in Task Force Wahl led by the 79th Infantry Division , which was defending against the January , 1945 , German counteroffensive in the Alsace @-@ Lorraine region . Disciplinary problems persisted ; the company ordered to lead the move was unable to deploy as most of its men were absent , and the remainder mostly drunk . By the time the battalion managed to move , one of its officers had shot a man — and been shot himself — while trying to restore order among his company , and in a separate incident a sergeant had been assaulted by one of his own men and , defending himself , accidentally shot a bystander . 
 The following two weeks saw a period of prolonged combat , as the task force slowly fell back to the pressure of the German offensive , with the battalion split up among various commands and often cut off or out of communication . The infantry units the tank destroyers were assigned to expected to take full operational control , often giving inappropriate orders more suited to tanks than to the lightly armored <unk> , breeding resentment among the battalion 's crews . At the same time , the 827th had trained with the expectation that the gunners would fire only on the direct instruction of their own officers , which limited both their ability to co @-@ operate with outsiders and their willingness to adapt and improvise during small @-@ scale combat . Vehicle commanders regularly argued about orders , or refused to act on them without their " own " commander present . In one case on 9 January , an infantry commander threatened to shoot a M18 crew if it did not engage a German tank stranded on the roadside . 
 Not all elements of the battalion suffered similar problems , however ; on the same day , 9 January , B Company destroyed eleven German tanks advancing on the village of <unk> , with four more the next day , while another section working with the <unk> Tank Destroyer Battalion in Hatten nearby accounted for nine . These units remained with the infantry in the village for several days , unable to withdraw , and acquitted themselves well in close fighting . This was all the more of an achievement when it was considered that , leaving disciplinary problems aside , the battalion suffered from major training deficiencies and was entirely combat inexperienced . One member of the battalion was awarded the Silver Star , while the 79th Division recommended a crew which had fought in Hatten to receive Bronze Stars — it is unclear if these were ever awarded . 
 = = Service duties = = 
 Following reports of disciplinary problems , VI Corps ordered an investigation , which took place over four days while elements of the battalion were still engaged at <unk> . It recommended that the battalion be withdrawn and retrained before returning to combat under a new commander , while Major @-@ General Edward H. Brooks , the corps commander , instead recommended that the battalion be entirely disbanded and its men distributed to other units . General Alexander Patch , commanding Seventh Army , agreed with Brooks , suggesting that a new tank destroyer battalion be formed from the men of service units , themselves replaced by the men of the 827th . This was contentious , however ; the number and status of segregated combat units was a matter of intense political debate , and converting a black combat unit to a service one , in favor of white troops , was likely controversial . 
 As discussion continued , the battalion was withdrawn from the front lines , leaving Task Force Wahl on 23 January . It returned to 12th Armored Division , where three platoons were committed to combat to support the fighting in the Colmar Pocket in the first week of February . The remainder of the battalion was kept in reserve , where the disciplinary problems , including assaults on civilians , grew to the point at which the commander had to request outside assistance to restore control on 5 February . The battalion was removed from its attachment to the 12th Armored on 12 February — by request of the divisional command — and withdrawn to the rear area of XV Corps to take up guard duties . 
 The battalion 's future had been referred to Sixth Army Group , the controlling formation , for further consideration ; after some debate , they requested the investigation be reopened with a particular focus on the enlisted men of the unit . The second inspection showed that the enlisted men were broadly competent at their duties , but that most of them preferred rear @-@ area duties over combat roles . The inspection recommended that the enlisted men be transferred to one of the segregated infantry divisions . In the event , the unit was assigned to Sixth Army Group headquarters , where it was used in a service role . It remained nominally active — to avoid the political fallout of deactivating a black combat unit — but its equipment was transferred as replacements to other battalions and the battalion itself was virtually disbanded as a combat unit . 
 = HD 28185 b = 
 HD 28185 b is an extrasolar planet approximately 138 light @-@ years away from Earth in the constellation of Eridanus . The planet was discovered orbiting the Sun @-@ like star HD 28185 in April 2001 as a part of the CORALIE survey for southern extrasolar planets , and its existence was independently confirmed by the Magellan Planet Search Survey in 2008 . HD 28185 b orbits its sun in a circular orbit that is at the inner edge of its star 's habitable zone . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 HD 28185 b was discovered by detecting small periodic variations in the radial velocity of its parent star caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet . This was achieved by measuring the Doppler shift of the star 's spectrum . In 2001 it was announced that HD 28185 exhibited a wobble along the line @-@ of @-@ sight with a period of 383 days , with an amplitude indicating a minimum mass 5 @.@ 72 times that of Jupiter . 
 = = Orbit and mass = = 
 HD 28185 b takes 1 @.@ 04 years to orbit its parent star . Unlike most known long @-@ period planets , the orbit of HD 28185 b has a low eccentricity , comparable to that of Mars in the Solar System . The orbit lies entirely within its star 's habitable zone . 
 The amplitude of the radial velocity oscillations means that the planet has a mass at least 5 @.@ 7 times that of Jupiter in the Solar System . However , the radial velocity method only yields a minimum value on the planet 's mass , depending on the orbital inclination to our line @-@ of @-@ sight . Therefore , the true mass of the planet may be much greater than this lower limit . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Given the planet 's high mass , it is most likely to be a gas giant with no solid surface . Since the planet has only been detected indirectly through observations of the star , properties such as its radius , composition , and temperature are unknown . 
 Since HD 28185 b orbits in its star 's habitable zone , some have speculated on the possibility of life on worlds in the HD 28185 system . While it is unknown whether gas giants can support life , simulations of tidal interactions suggest that HD 28185 b could harbor Earth @-@ mass satellites in orbit around it for many billions of years . Such moons , if they exist , may be able to provide a habitable environment , though it is unclear whether such satellites would form in the first place . Additionally , a small planet in one of the gas giant 's Trojan points could survive in a habitable orbit for long periods . The high mass of HD 28185 b , of over six Jupiter masses , actually makes either of these scenarios more likely than if the planet was about Jupiter 's mass or less . 
 = Joachim Helbig = 
 Oberst Joachim Helbig ( 10 September 1915 – 5 October 1985 ) was an officer and pilot in the German Luftwaffe bomber arm during World War II . He was credited with the destruction of 182 @,@ 000 gross register tons ( GRT ) of Allied shipping accomplished in 480 missions during World War II . 
 Joachim Helbig was born in 1915 and joined the Luftwaffe in 1936 . At the outbreak of World War II he served as an observer in Lehrgeschwader 1 ( LG 1 ) and participated in the invasion of Poland . He saw further action in the Norwegian Campaign and the Battles of the Netherlands , Belgium and France . For his contribution and military success in these campaigns Helbig received the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) on 9 November 1940 . He was then transferred to the Mediterranean theater of operations where he operated against Malta , the British Mediterranean Fleet and in support of the Deutsches Afrikakorps ( <unk> ) . Helbig became the 20th recipient of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern ) on 28 September 1942 for the support of Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel 's 1942 summer offensive and the sinking of 182 @,@ 000 GRT of enemy shipping . 
 Initially Helbig was banned from further combat flying and became an inspector on the staff of the General der Kampfflieger , the senior officer responsible for the Luftwaffe 's bomber force . In August 1943 he was made Geschwaderkommodore of Lehrgeschwader 1 operating against the Allied invasion forces in Italy . In the last weeks of the war in Europe , Helbig commanded a combat unit on the Eastern Front consisting of elements of Lehrgeschwader 1 and Kampfgeschwader 200 ( KG 200 ) . After the war he worked as a manager for a brewery in Berlin . Joachim Helbing died in <unk> on 5 October 1985 following a car accident on vacation in Spain .

 Joachim Helbig was born on 10 September 1915 on the estate called <unk> , which is located in Dahlen , Saxony . He grew up in the countryside and was very fond of horse back riding . He volunteered for military service on 1 April 1935 and initially served one year with the <unk> 4 ( 4th Artillery Regiment ) in Dresden . In the fall of 1936 , he transferred to the <unk> ( Combat or Bomber Flying School ) in Lechfeld . After completing his training as an observer and aerial gunner on 20 April 1937 , he was posted with III . Gruppe ( 3rd Group ) Kampfgeschwader ( Bomber Wing ) 152 " Hindenburg " in Schwerin . III . / KG 152 " Hindenburg " became II . Group of Lehrgeschwader 1 ( 1st Demonstration Wing ) on 1 November 1938 , where he started his informal pilot training . 
 His two friends , Oberleutnant Fritz Sohler and Oberleutnant Gerhard Schröder , taught " Observer " Helbig to fly and he earned his Luftwaffe Advanced Pilot 's Certificate ( Erweiterter Luftwaffen @-@ Flugzeugführerschein ) , also known as ' C ' -Certificate , confirming proficiency on multi @-@ engine aircraft . Helbig 's informal training was unique in the entire Luftwaffe bomber force . 
 = = = Invasions of Poland , Norway and France = = = 
 Leutnant Helbig was still an observer in a He 111 <unk> ( Bomber Reconnaissance ) at the outbreak of World War II . On the third day of the Polish campaign , while on a recon mission over Poland , Helbig shot down a Polish reconnaissance aircraft . Although the next day he was injured in a motorcycle accident , which prevented him from seeing further combat in this campaign , he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd class ( Eisernes Kreuz 2 . Klasse ) . In October 1939 , he participated in a number of uneventful missions against the British Home Fleet in the North Sea . 
 By 9 April 1940 , when Operation Weserübung began in Norway , Helbig had completed his pilot training . He flew missions supporting the German ground forces , particularly in the Narvik area . For these missions , the He 111s took off from Aalborg for low @-@ altitude strikes against British positions . In one such sortie , Helbig 's flight engineer was severely wounded , and the left engine of his aircraft was shot out by flak . Helbig received the Narvik Shield for his participation in the battle for Norway . 
 When the campaign against the Netherlands , Belgium , and France began in May 1940 , Helbig was appointed Staffelkapitän ( Squadron Leader ) of 4 . / LG 1 , a position he held until 5 November 1941 . 4 . / LG 1 was equipped with the Ju 88 . On one mission over Dunkirk , Helbig 's aircraft was intercepted by enemy fighters . One engine was shot out and three crew members , including Helbig , suffered various degrees of injuries . For his actions in the French campaign , he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st class ( Eisernes Kreuz 1 . Klasse ) . Following the defeat of France , he received an early promotion to Hauptmann ( Captain ) on 19 July 1940 . 
 = = = Battle of Britain = = = 
 On 15 August 1940 , Helbig and his Staffel ( Squadron ) , consisting of nine Ju 88s , took off from Orléans at 4 : 45 pm , with the primary target RAF Worthy Down . Over the English coast the German formation consisting of Ju 88s from LG 1 , Ju 87s from Sturzkampfgeschwader 1 ( StG 1 ; 1st Dive Bomber Wing ) escorted by elements of Zerstörergeschwader 2 ( ZG 2 ; 2nd Heavy Fighter Wing ) , Jagdgeschwader 27 ( JG 27 ; 27th Fighter Wing ) and Jagdgeschwader 53 ( JG 53 ; 53rd Fighter Wing ) , were intercepted by British fighters from No. 10 Group RAF and No. 11 Group RAF . The combined attacking force of more than 200 German aircraft were intercepted by 14 British fighter squadrons totaling 170 fighter aircraft . This mission turned out to be disastrous for 4th Staffel . Only Helbig and his crew returned their heavily damaged aircraft back to friendly territory . The majority of his men , 32 members of the 4th Staffel , were taken prisoner by the British . 
 As the Battle of Britain progressed , Helbig developed into an industrial target specialist . As a result of his success during more than 100 combat missions , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross . By the time Helbig received the coveted decoration , he had flown 122 combat missions . 
 Helbig 's success in surviving seemingly hopeless situations was due to his excellent crew , which included Oberfeldwebel Franz Schlund who , on 30 August 1941 , became the first Luftwaffe radio operator to be awarded the Knight 's Cross . Manning one of the machine guns , Schlund drove off the attacking fighter force on a mission against the Warrington Propeller Works located north of Liverpool . He also contributed to the success of other missions , including the attack and destruction of the lock entrance to the Manchester Ship Canal at Eastham and the attack on the pilot training airfield at Penrose . In more than 200 combat missions , Schlund successfully fought off 13 attacks by enemy fighters .

 The Fourth Staffel of LG 1 was ordered to attack the British ships in the port of Piraeus on the night of Good Friday 1941 . During this moonlight mission , Helbig dive @-@ bombed and sank a troop transport ship , most likely the <unk> , which was also used as a hospital ship by Greek forces . On 5 November 1941 Helbig took <unk> as Gruppenkommandeur ( Group Commander ) of I. ( Kampf ) / LG 1 ( 1st Bomber Group of the 1st Demonstration Wing ) , succeeding Hauptmann Kuno Hoffmann . With 220 combat missions flown , he was one of the youngest Gruppenkommandeure in the Luftwaffe . On 16 January 1942 Helbig became the 64th recipient of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub ) after having completed 300 combat missions . During the German assault on Tobruk in 1942 , Helbig , flying two missions per night , bombed the heavily defended fortress on ten consecutive nights . Taking off from Heraklion , each mission lasted 4 to 4 @.@ 5 hours . 
 Five Ju 88s from I. ( Kampf ) / LG 1 took off on an armed reconnaissance patrol in the sea area south of Crete on 11 May 1942 . The crew of Oberfeldwebel Otto Leupert was searching the area of quadrant <unk> / 23 East — roughly 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) south of Crete — and detected the four British destroyers HMS Jervis , HMS Kipling , HMS Jackal and HMS Lively before noon . Joachim Helbig was immediately informed by radio communications . The destroyers approached the sea between Crete and Tobruk at around noon and were again spotted by a German reconnaissance aircraft at 12 : 35 pm . At 2 : 30 pm 14 Ju 88s from I. ( Kampf ) / LG 1 headed for quadrant <unk> / 23 East . The aircraft were armed with two 500 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) and two 250 @-@ kilogram ( 550 lb ) bombs . Despite the protection of accompanying Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers from No. 272 Squadron RAF , operating as long @-@ range fighters , the Ju 88s attacked . The HMS Lively was struck by Oberfeldwebel Leupert and sank at about 3 : 30 pm . After refueling and rearming , a second wave led by Leupert failed to reach the destroyers . 
 The third wave led by Hauptmann Helbig took off from Heraklion with seven aircraft of I. Gruppe / LG 1 . His flight included the experienced veterans Oberleutnant Iro Ilk , Oberleutnant Backhaus , Leutnant Gerhard Brenner and Oberfeldwebel Otto Leupert . The seven Ju 88s attacked the destroyers with the already setting sun behind them . In the space of ten minutes , they sank two of the three vessels . Helbig had selected the Kipling as his target . His four bombs struck the destroyer amidships , sinking her at 32 @.@ 39 ° N 26 @.@ 19 ° E ﻿ / 32 @.@ 39 ; 26 @.@ 19 . The Jackal was hit several times . The British attempted to tow the crippled vessel to a friendly port ; however , the next day , it sank , scuttled by Jervis . This achievement earned Helbig his first of two references in the Wehrmachtbericht on 13 May 1942 . The Wehrmachtbericht was a daily propaganda radio report made by the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht ( High Command of the Armed Forces ) reporting on the military situation on all fronts . He also developed a reputation among his opponents : The British called his squadron " The Helbig Flyers " . In June 1942 , British commandos targeted his unit at their base in Heraklion , and succeeded in blowing up seven of his Ju 88s . 
 Helbig flew numerous missions in support of the Siege of Malta .

 In January 1943 , Helbig was transferred to the staff of the General der Kampfflieger ( Commander of Bombers ) , as an inspector . In March 1943 he was often tasked with the duties of the General der Kampfflieger and in this role he received a preferential promotion to Oberstleutnant ( Lieutenant Colonel ) on 1 September 1943 . After numerous difficulties and clashes with his superiors , including Generalfeldmarschall ( Field Marshal ) Albert Kesselring , who lacked his operational expertise , he transferred to an operational unit and was made Geschwaderkommodore ( Wing Commander ) of Lehrgeschwader 1 on 14 August 1943 in Wiener Neustadt . 
 Helbig led his Geschwader against the Allied beachheads at Anzio and Nettuno in Italy with the beginning of Operation Shingle on 22 January 1944 . On 23 January 1944 LG 1 sank the HMS Janus with a Henschel Hs 293 glider bomb and again damaged the Jervis severely for the loss of 11 aircraft . In Italy on 30 January 1944 , his Ju 88 L1 + AM was destroyed in an aerial attack by American bombers . This aircraft , which was solely piloted by Helbig himself , was the only Ju 88 to survive more than 1 @,@ 000 hours of combat operations . After successful operations against Allied airfields on the isle of Corsica , he was mentioned a second time in the Wehrmachtbericht on 28 May 1944 . 
 = = = In defense of the Reich = = = 
 On 6 June 1944 LG 1 was ordered to transfer to Belgium for air defence during the Allied invasion of France . Helbig ordered the transfer postponed due to unfavourable weather conditions over Southern France and fearing that the intensive Allied fighter operations in the area would render any movement impossible without sustaining high losses . Helbig was accused of disobeying orders by Luftflotte 2 ( 2nd Air Fleet ) . Helbig relocated the Geschwader as soon as the low @-@ pressure area dissipated , arriving in Belgium at dusk without losing a single aircraft . 
 The court martial proceedings against Helbig , which had already begun , were dropped , because he was able to prove that his actions had been of decisive importance in preserving the Geschwader and its operational readiness . It was at this time that Helbig received the promotion to Oberst ( Colonel ) on 1 July 1944 which Generalfeldmarschall Wolfram von Richthofen had proposed some time earlier . Helbig then led his Geschwader with some success in the battles against the invasion fleet . However the ever present Allied fighter aircraft over the invasion front inflicted heavy losses on LG 1 . 
 He formed a combined ground support and reconnaissance battle group in defense of the Reich on 10 September 1944 . Visiting one of the ground support squadrons at Vogelsang in the Eifel , he was severely wounded by strafing enemy aircraft . Due to his injuries Helbig had to surrender command of the Gefechtsverband Helbig , as the battle group was referred to , to the commander and Geschwaderkommodore of Kampfgeschwader 2 ( KG 2 ) Oberstleutnant Rudolf <unk> . Shortly before the end of World War II , he led a small battle group made up of LG 1 and Kampfgeschwader 200 . He was ordered by Generalmajor Franz Reuß , commanding general of the 4 . Flieger @-@ Division ( 4th Air Division ) , on 30 April 1945 to lead a small formation of Fieseler Fi 156 Storch . The unit was to fly into Berlin @-@ Wannsee and evacuate at least ten high @-@ ranking officials , people from Adolf Hitler 's inner circle , of the Reich . Nine aircraft headed for Berlin , but were forced to abandon the mission due to strong defensive anti @-@ aircraft fire . 
 The city of Hamburg was declared an open city on 3 May 1945 and I. / LG 1 abandoned their positions in southern Hamburg and relocated to <unk> near Elmshorn , roughly 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) north of Hamburg , on 4 May 1945 . Helbig received the order to leave his Geschwader to serve as a courier , flying vital documents and secret orders from the Flensburg government to the senior command staff of Generalfeldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner , the new Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the German Army ( Oberbefehlshaber des Heeres ) , in Czechoslovakia . After delivering his reports , he departed early on the evening of 8 May 1945 . Flying west , he avoided capture by the Red Army and escaped from Czechoslovakia . He was taken prisoner of war ( POW ) by the Americans and was taken to the <unk> POW camp from which he escaped on 9 June . 
 After the war Helbig built a civilian life and became a manager of the Schultheiss Brewery on the Kreuzberg in Berlin . He died on 5 October 1985 in <unk> , following a road accident on his way to vacation in Spain two days earlier .

During her international swimming career , Haislett won twenty @-@ two medals in major international championships , including fourteen golds . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Haislett was born in St. Petersburg , Florida in 1972 . She was a " water baby " — she learned to swim at 18 months old . At the time , her parents merely wanted her to be comfortable in water , not intending that swimming would become her life focus . She began to train with the St. Pete Aquatics Club at the age of 6 . Haislett attended Lakewood High School in St. Petersburg , where she swam for the Lakewood Spartans high school swim team , winning four Florida high school state championships in two years . As a 16 @-@ year @-@ old high school junior , she won the 50- , 100- and 200 @-@ meter events at the U.S. Open Swimming Championships in 1989 .

 Haislett was the first American woman to defeat a swimmer from East Germany in the 100 @-@ meter freestyle since the 1972 Summer Olympics ; she did so at the 1990 Goodwill Games in Seattle , Washington . At the 1991 World Aquatics Championships in Perth , Western Australia , Haislett won the 100 @-@ meter freestyle , and swam the anchor legs for the winning U.S. teams in the 4 × 100 @-@ meter freestyle and the 4 × 100 @-@ meter medley relays , ending the East German women 's eighteen years of overwhelming dominance in the 100 @-@ meter freestyle at the world championships . Haislett also endured the emotional agony of disqualifying her team on an early exchange in the 4 × 200 @-@ meter freestyle relay – a relay race that the American women won in the water . 
 Haislett qualified for four events at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona , Spain . After finishing a disappointing fourth in the women 's 100 @-@ meter freestyle , Haislett won the 200 @-@ meter freestyle event with a time of 1 : 57 @.@ 90 for her first Olympic gold medal . Drafting off German swimmer Franziska Van <unk> , she swam what was described as a " perfect race .

Haislett swam the freestyle leg in the preliminaries of the 4 × 100 @-@ meter medley relay to earn her third Olympic gold medal . 
 Haislett was the first American woman to swim the 200 @-@ meter freestyle in under one minute , fifty @-@ eight seconds ( 1 : 58 ) , and held the American record until 2003 , when it was broken by Lindsay Benko . After six months in residence at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs , she announced her retirement from competition swimming in 1995 , citing her prior success and waning motivation and competitive desire .

 = Teddy Sheean = 
 Edward " Teddy " Sheean ( 28 December 1923 – 1 December 1942 ) was a sailor in the Royal Australian Navy during the Second World War . Born in Tasmania , Sheean was employed as a farm labourer when he enlisted in the Royal Australian Naval Reserve in April 1941 . Following training at HMAS Derwent and the Flinders Naval Depot , he was posted to Sydney , where he joined the newly commissioned corvette HMAS Armidale in June 1942 . Sheean served aboard Armidale as she initially took part in escort duties along the eastern Australian coast and in New Guinea waters , before he transferred with the ship to Darwin in October , where Armidale was tasked with assisting Australian operations in Timor . 
 On 29 November 1942 , Armidale set out for an operation to Betano , Timor , along with HMAS Castlemaine . The two ships were attacked by Japanese aircraft along the way , and were subsequently late in arriving at their destination , missing a planned rendezvous with HMAS Kuru . While returning to Darwin , the pair encountered Kuru south of Betano and it was decided by Castlemaine 's commanding officer — as the senior officer — that Armidale and Kuru should voyage to Betano . The two ships undertook different routes to Betano , during which both vessels came under aerial assault . 
 During a subsequent confrontation with thirteen Japanese aircraft on 1 December , Armidale was struck by two torpedoes and a bomb , and began to sink ; the order to abandon ship was given . After helping to free a life @-@ raft , Sheean was wounded by two bullets . He made his way to the aft Oerlikon 20 mm cannon and began to fire on the Japanese aircraft to protect those in the water . Sheean managed to shoot down one of the Japanese bombers , but was killed when Armidale sank . Many of the survivors credited their lives to Sheean and he was posthumously mentioned in despatches . In 1999 , the submarine HMAS Sheean was named in his honour , and efforts have been made to have Sheean belatedly awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Sheean was born in Lower Barrington , Tasmania , on 28 December 1923 , the youngest of fourteen children to James Sheean , a labourer , and his wife Mary Jane ( née Broomhall ) . Soon after Edward 's birth , the Sheean family moved to Latrobe , where he was educated at the local Catholic school . Following the completion of his schooling , Sheean gained casual employment working on several farms in the vicinity of Latrobe and <unk> . 
 = = Second World War = = 
 On 21 April 1941 , Sheean enlisted in the Royal Australian Naval Reserve . He had followed in the steps of five of his brothers who had already joined the armed forces — four in the Australian Army and one in the Royal Australian Navy — for service in the Second World War . Sheean was initially posted to the Hobart naval base HMAS Derwent for training , where he gained a period of seafaring experience aboard HMAS <unk> , an auxiliary minesweeper , from 17 – 31 December . On finishing his initial training course , Sheean was attached to the Flinders Naval Depot in Western Port , Victoria , for further instruction from 11 February 1942 . 
 Completing his course at the Flinders Naval Depot , Sheean was posted to the Garden Island naval base HMAS Penguin in Sydney Harbour on 11 May . During his time with Penguin , he was billeted on the requisitioned ferry HMAS Kuttabul . Granted a period of leave later that month , he returned home to Tasmania . While he was on leave , Japanese midget submarines attacked Sydney Harbour and sank Kuttabul on 31 May . Returning to Sydney eleven days after the raid , Sheean joined the newly commissioned Bathurst @-@ class corvette HMAS Armidale as an Oerlikon anti @-@ aircraft gun loader . 
 Leaving Sydney Harbour in late August 1942 , Sheean served aboard Armidale as she carried out " relatively uneventful " escort duties along the North Queensland , Port Moresby and Milne Bay coasts over the subsequent two months . During October , Armidale was ordered to Darwin . Setting sail , she arrived on 7 November and was detailed to assist in the Australian operations in Timor . 
 = = = Sinking of Armidale = = = 
 On 24 November 1942 , the evacuation of the 2 / 2nd Australian Independent Company from Timor along with 150 Portuguese people was approved by the Allied Land Forces Headquarters . In response to this , Commodore Cuthbert Pope , the Naval Officer @-@ in @-@ Charge Darwin , organised an operation utilizing HMA Ships Kuru , Castlemaine and Armidale . The operation was to involve the three ships undertaking two voyages each , the first to take place on the night of 30 November / 1 December and involve a trip to Betano , Timor , in which the ships were to land 50 fresh Dutch guerrillas in the area along with supplies , and simultaneously withdraw 190 Dutch soldiers as well as the 150 Portuguese refugees . The second excursion was to be carried out on the night of 4 / 5 December , and entail the extraction of the 2 / 2nd Independent Company . 
 At 22 : 30 on 28 November 1942 , Kuru set sail for Betano . Kuru was scheduled to arrive at approximately 20 : 30 on 30 November , where she was to unload the supplies on board and embark the Portuguese refugees , which were to transfer to Castlemaine once she arrived along with Armidale two hours later . However , Kuru hit bad weather during her voyage and arrived at Betano three hours late . Armidale — with two Dutch Army officers , 61 Netherlands East Indies troops and three Australian Army soldiers aboard — and Castlemaine set sail from Darwin at 01 : 42 on 29 November . At approximately 09 : 15 on 30 November , while 190 kilometres ( 100 nmi ) from their destination , the two ships were attacked by a single Japanese aircraft . Having missed with several bombs , the aircraft flew off in the direction of Timor an hour later . Fearing that their discovery by this aircraft would jeopardise the mission , Castlemaine 's Commanding Officer , Lieutenant Commander Philip Sullivan , ordered evasive action and signalled Darwin for further orders . A signal returned decreeing that the operation must proceed and a party of fighter aircraft were to be dispatched as protective cover . 
 Continuing in their voyage , Armidale and Castlemaine were attacked twice more by air , each time by a formation of bombers that bombed and machine @-@ gunned the ships . Despite this , neither ship suffered damage or casualties and both arrived at Betano at 03 : 30 on 1 December , however there was no sign of Kuru . Having made sure that Kuru was not in the bay , the two corvettes decided to abandon the mission and sailed south in order to return to Darwin . Kuru 's commanding officer , Lieutenant John Grant , had loaded 77 of the Portuguese refugees as well as one critically injured Australian soldier on board the ship and set sail at around 02 : 00 on 1 December from Betano , fearing he had missed the rendezvous with the other two ships . While approximately 110 kilometres ( 59 nmi ) south of Betano , Armidale and Castlemaine sighted Kuru , and the three ships closed by dawn . 
 Following the transfer of passengers from Kuru to Castlemaine , the former received orders that she was to return to Betano that evening " and do the job tonight " . At this time , a formation of Japanese aircraft was spotted and Kuru sailed for cover . Assessing the situation , Sullivan — as senior officer — decided that Armidale would accompany Kuru in order to unload the former 's passengers at Betano while Castlemaine returned to Darwin . Armidale and Kuru assumed separate routes to Betano , and at approximately 13 : 00 Armidale was attacked by a party of five Japanese bombers ; the explosives , however , fell wide of their target . At 13 : 58 , Armidale reported that she was under attack from " nine bombers , four fighters " over the Arafura Sea . 
 Armidale undertook evasive action , manoeuvring frantically to avoid the aerial attack . However , at 15 : 15 , the vessel was struck by two air @-@ launched torpedoes , one hitting her port side and the other colliding with the engineering spaces , before a bomb exploded aft . Armidale listed sharply to port at this stage , and the order was given to abandon ship . As the crew leapt into the sea , they were strafed by the attacking aircraft . Sheean — after assisting to free a life @-@ raft — was hit by two bullets from one of the aircraft , wounding him in the chest and back . Scrambling across the deck , he strapped himself into the aft Oerlikon 20 mm cannon and began shooting at the fighters in an effort to protect some of the sailors already in the sea . Subject to the fire from Sheean 's Oerlikon , the Japanese aircraft were kept at bay and were unable to effectively strafe those in the water . 
 With Armidale rapidly sinking , Sheean continued to fire and managed to shoot down one of the Japanese bombers . He damaged a further two aircraft before Armidale 's stern was engulfed by the sea . Despite this , Sheean maintained his fire as the water rose above his feet , and remained firing as he " disappeared beneath the waves " . Sheean 's crewmates later testified to witnessing tracers rising from beneath the water 's surface as Sheean was dragged under . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Sheean was among 100 of the original 149 people on board HMAS Armidale at the time of the attack who were killed during the ship 's sinking and its aftermath . Many of the survivors attributed their lives to Sheean . For his " bravery and devotion when HMAS Armidale was lost " , Sheean 's actions were recognised with a posthumous Mention in Despatches , awarded on the recommendation of Armidale 's commanding officer , Lieutenant Commander David Richards , and announced in a supplement to The London Gazette on 29 June 1943 . However , many hold the opinion that Sheean 's gallantry , devotion to duty and self @-@ sacrifice were worthy of the Victoria Cross , with author Robert Macklin stating his " actions were in the highest tradition of the Australian military " and comparing them with those of Vietnam War Victoria Cross recipient Kevin Wheatley . 
 On 1 May 1999 , the submarine HMAS Sheean was launched by Ivy Hayes — sister of Teddy Sheean — named in the ordinary seaman 's honour . Sheean was subsequently commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy on 23 February 2001 , and was the first Royal Australian Navy vessel to be named in honour of a naval rating . Carrying the motto " Fight On " , the vessel was one of six Collins @-@ class submarines entered into service . Later that year , a Bill was introduced into the Australian Senate to have three awards of the Victoria Cross for Australia made , one being to Sheean . The Bill came as part of a campaign by the then @-@ leader of the Australian Labor Party and Federal Opposition , Kim Beazley , to secure more rights for war veterans . However , it was subsequently rejected by the Liberal Government . A painting depicting Sheean 's final moments is held by the Australian War Memorial . His home town of Latrobe commemorates his life via the Sheean Walk and Teddy Sheean Memorial , opened in 1992 . In 2003 , the Australian Navy Cadets established a training ship at <unk> , Queensland , called NTS Sheean in his honour . 
 = = = Valour Inquiry = = = 
 In 2011 , at the direction of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence , Senator David Feeney , the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal opened an inquiry into thirteen cases of unresolved recognition for past acts of gallantry . Among the group were eleven naval personnel , including Sheean . Known as the ' Valour Inquiry ' , the Tribunal was directed to determine if the individuals were unduly overlooked for recognition at the time of their actions and , if so , whether retrospective awards were appropriate . The inquiry lasted two years and witnessed 166 written submissions from the public , before the Tribunal reported its findings in January 2013 . In the case of Sheean , the Tribunal found that there was no manifest injustice with the award of the Mention in Despatches , and that there was no new evidence to support the reconsideration of Sheean for a Victoria Cross for Australia . If Sheean had lived , they reported , he might have been recommended for either the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal or the Distinguished Service Medal instead , but neither medal could be awarded posthumously in 1942 . The Tribunal did recommend that the RAN perpetuate the use of Sheean as the name of a major combatant vessel .

 Born in Newcastle upon Tyne , Tyne and Wear , Chopra attended Gosforth High School in Newcastle , and owing to his goal @-@ scoring exploits there , and later with the Montagu Boys ' Club , was recruited to the Newcastle United academy in July 1993 . Being an unused substitute for Newcastle in a Premier League match against Charlton Athletic in October 2002 , Chopra signed a three @-@ year contract with the club on 30 October . 
 Chopra made his professional debut on 6 November , at St James ' Park against Everton in the League Cup . Coming as a substitute for <unk> <unk> , he missed a penalty kick in the shootout , sending Everton to the round of 16 . He made his UEFA Champions League debut in December 2002 against Barcelona . Coming as a substitute for Lualua , in the final minutes of the match , Newcastle was handed a 3 – 1 defeat . 
 Further playing once for the club against Bayer Leverkusen , Chopra was loaned to second @-@ tier club Watford for five matches on 25 March 2003 . During his short loan spell , he scored five goals in as many matches , which included four goals against Burnley . Being behind Alan Shearer , Craig Bellamy , Shola Ameobi and Lualua in the pecking order , Watford manager Ray Lewington expressed his desire to re @-@ sign him on loan for the next season . He said that Chopra " had an experience he wouldn 't have believed a month ago having played in an FA Cup semi @-@ final . " In September of the same year , the BBC reported that Indian club Mohun Bagan was interested in signing him . 
 Failing to find a goal in the 2003 – 04 season , Newcastle loaned Chopra to Nottingham Forest for a month in February 2004 . Even there he failed to find the net , as he ended the season playing eleven times without scoring . At the start of the 2004 – 05 season , he was loaned for a month to League One club Barnsley in August . Making his debut against Hull City , he would score his first goal for Barnsley against Hartlepool . Chopra " fired Barnsley ahead " to give them a lead , only to be equalized by Adam Boyd in the final minutes of the match . Scoring a total of five goals , his loan was extended in November till the end of the season . In the rest of the season , Chopra scored twelve times – including two hat @-@ tricks , one against Peterborough and another against Huddersfield . 
 In August 2004 he went on loan to League One club Barnsley for the entirety of the 2004 – 05 season . He scored 17 goals in 42 appearances for Paul Hart 's " <unk> " , including hat @-@ tricks against Peterborough United and Huddersfield Town . New Barnsley boss Andy Ritchie intended to sign Chopra in the summer to play alongside Paul Hayes , but was unsuccessful . 
 Chopra began the 2005 – 06 season back in Newcastle 's first team , scoring his first senior goal for Newcastle in the 3 – 1 away win to Slovakian side <unk> on 17 July in UEFA Intertoto Cup . Making his second ever start for Newcastle , he opened the scoring in the fourth minute of the match . In the second leg of the match , he suffered concussion with Sky Sports reporting that he was " set to miss out " the next match against Spanish club Deportivo de La <unk> . Nevertheless , he played in that match where he " slid home Charles N <unk> 's cross at the far post " . In a Premier League match against Sunderland in April 2006 , Chopra would score the fastest goal by a substitute – find the net after coming for fifteen seconds . Later in that season Chopra injured his knee ligaments , which he claimed to be the " worst injury " he ever had .

 Becoming frustrated owing to his failure to make an impact in Newcastle , Chopra signed for Cardiff City in June 2006 for £ 500 @,@ 000 . On his decision of leaving Newcastle Chopra commented that he had shown his loyalty to the club [ Newcastle ] and expressed his desire to get the same loyalty from the club . He also added that he would love to return to Newcastle in the future . During the season , Chopra scored 22 goals in forty 44 matches . He helped the club to stay in the " top of the table " during the month of September , and earning the Championship Player of the month for September . He was also featured in the PFA Team of the season ( an annual award given to a set of 44 footballers in the top four tiers of English football ) .

 In July 2007 , newly promoted Premier League side Sunderland agreed a deal worth up to £ 5 million , activating a release clause , to sign Chopra on a four @-@ year contract . His Geordie roots and high price @-@ tag caused unrest among some Sunderland fans . He scored on his debut for the " Black Cats " on the opening day of the 2007 – 08 season at the Stadium of Light , when Chopra came on as a substitute late in the second half and scored the winning goal against Tottenham Hotspur in injury time . He scored in the next game at Birmingham City , but then went 15 games without scoring before he converted a penalty at Reading on 23 December . He went on to score the only goal of a 1 – 0 win over Aston Villa at Villa Park , before he scored his sixth and final goal of the season in Sunderland 's 3 – 2 win over Tees – Wear derby rivals Middlesbrough , finishing as the second highest scorer at the club , being just one goal behind Kenwyne Jones . After missing the initial matches for " personal problems " , he scored two goals in his second game of the 2008 – 09 season as Sunderland beat Middlesbrough 2 – 0 on 20 September . 
 With the arrivals of Djibril Cisse and El @-@ Hadji Diouf , Chopra found his playing time to be limited . So he rejoined Cardiff City in November on a two @-@ month loan . Chopra made his debut against Queens Park Rangers playing the entire ninety minutes of the 1 – 0 defeat . In the next match against Crystal Palace , he found his first goal . Chopra converted a 31st @-@ minute penalty the saw Cardiff winning the match 2 – 1 . Scoring five goals his the spell , he was recalled from loan by the new Sunderland manager Ricky Sbragia to the squad , with The Guardian writing that he was " excited " to return to the squad . Chopra rejoined Cardiff on loan in February 2009 for the rest of the season , with the transfer becoming permanent at the end of the season . Cardiff chairman Peter Ridsdale said that Chopra was " over the moon " about the transfer . During his second loan spell at the club , he found the net four times . 
 = = = Return to Cardiff = = = 
 Chopra completed a permanent move on 1 July following the opening of the transfer window for a fee of £ 3 million . The transfer smashed the club 's transfer record which was previously held by the £ 1 @.@ 75 million signing of Peter Thorne from Stoke City in 2001 . He scored in his debut , " claiming the first and third goals " in a 4 – 0 victory over Rotherham United . Chopra then would score consecutively in matches against Blackpool , Plymouth Argyle , Bristol City and Bristol Rovers . In the post @-@ match ceremony , manager Dave Jones commented , " Chopra is on fire , he 's scored seven goals already and he 's shown he will get the goals if he gets the supply " . Chopra scored a total of 21 goals which included a four @-@ goal haul against Derby County . For a second time , he was included in the PFA Team of the Year . 
 After the season , Goal.com reported that Ipswich Town lodged a £ 3 million bid to secure Chopra 's services . Though it was increased , he continued the next season with Cardiff City . In the 2010 – 11 season , he suffered a hamstring injury during a match against Barnsley on 23 April 2011 ruling him out of action for 10 to 12 weeks . A statement released by the club hailed it as a " disappointing news " as they would prepare for the rest of their matches without one of their " potent attacking options " . His played his next match against Queens Park Rangers on 23 April which ended in a 2 – 2 draw . He also featured in both the legs of the Championship play @-@ offs against Reading . In the second leg , he was near to scoring , only for his shot to be deflected by Reading captain Matt Mills .

He started his Ipswich years with a bang scoring twice in his debut against Bristol City . He also scored a goal in each of the two match = es against his former club Cardiff City . He ended the season as the club 's top scorer with 14 goals . However , Chopra had a lackluster second season with the club , where he scored five times in thirty six matches . Unhappy with his performance , manager Mick McCarthy said that he was not in his plans for going forward and they were free to look for another club . Nevertheless , he found the winner goal in the dying minutes of a match against Watford . Though he missed a couple of chance earlier in the match , he was successful in converting Carlos Edwards low cross in the last minute of the encounter .

He made his debut in the first match against NorthEast United FC , coming as a substitute in a 1 – 0 defeat , with The Times of India commenting that he " looked sharp " . His time in India was cut short by an injury which he suffered in a training for a match against Atlético de Kolkata . Goal.com criticized him for his poor " fitness level " and wrote that he never " impressed in the competition and failed to find the back of the net " . Nevertheless , he played the 120 minutes of the semifinal against <unk> FC , and also started the final against the <unk> side where he managed two shots on goal .

 Born and raised in England , Chopra is eligible to play for India through his father . In November 2010 , Chopra entered into talks over acquiring an Indian passport in order to represent India in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup . However , without an Indian passport , and the Indian government 's refusal to change its stance on dual citizenship , Chopra cannot play for India without first renouncing his British citizenship . In August 2014 , Chopra stated that he wanted to play for India at international level , and was willing to renounce his British citizenship to do so .

 = Golden white @-@ eye = 
 The golden white @-@ eye ( Cleptornis <unk> ) is a species of bird in the white @-@ eye family <unk> . It is the only species within the genus Cleptornis . The golden white @-@ eye was once considered to be a honeyeater in the family Meliphagidae and although it is now known to be a white @-@ eye , its position within that family is still uncertain . The species is restricted to the islands of Saipan and Aguijan in the Northern Mariana Islands , where it is sympatric ( shares its range ) and competes with the related bridled white @-@ eye . The golden white @-@ eye has golden plumage and a pale eye @-@ ring . It feeds on insects , fruit , and nectar and forages in pairs or small family groups . The bird is monogamous and lays two eggs in a small cup nest . 
 Fossil evidence shows the golden white @-@ eye once also occurred on Tinian and Rota but was extirpated in those locations through the impact of human activities . Despite its current abundance on Saipan and Aguijan , and the fact that it has among the highest recorded densities for any bird , it is nevertheless considered to be critically endangered . It is threatened by the invasive brown tree snake , which has become established on nearby Guam , and this predator is expected to cause a rapid decline in the population if it reaches Saipan . Efforts are under way to control the snakes and breed the white @-@ eye in zoos . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was once called the golden honeyeater as it was considered to be a honeyeater ( Meliphagidae ) . It was placed within the genus <unk> by French naturalist Émile Oustalet when he described the species in 1889 ; that genus is now considered defunct and is no longer used . It was subsequently moved into the genus Cleptornis , which had been provisionally established by Oustalet in case the species proved to be distinct . Behavioural and morphological characteristics led American ornithologist Harold Douglas Pratt , Jr . , to suggest in 1987 that it was related to the white @-@ eyes . Subsequent studies have supported the idea that this species was a white @-@ eye . It is possibly most closely related to the Micronesian white @-@ eyes of the genus Rukia , or the monotypic Bonin white @-@ eye ( <unk> ) , another species once placed with the honeyeaters and subsequently moved to the white @-@ eyes . The golden white @-@ eye has a long 10th primary feather ( one of the flight feathers ) , unlike other white @-@ eyes where that primary is reduced or absent , which has led to the alternative suggestion that it is basal ( an early offshoot ) among the white @-@ eyes . 
 Its generic name , Cleptornis , is derived from the Ancient Greek <unk> , a robber or thief , and <unk> , a bird . This is not a reference to any aspect of the golden white @-@ eye 's behaviour , but to the old French name of the Mariana Islands , les Îles des <unk> , or Robbers ' Islands . The specific epithet <unk> refers to the French explorer and writer Antoine @-@ Alfred Marche , who procured the original specimens . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The golden white @-@ eye is endemic to the Northern Mariana Islands in the western Pacific Ocean , where it currently occurs on the islands of Saipan and Aguijan . Within its range , it occupies a variety of habitats , both natural and man @-@ made . It is common in native forests , particularly limestone forests , but also occurs in open shrubland and suburban areas . On Saipan , the only habitats it is absent from are the marshes around Lake <unk> and grassy savannas . 
 = = Description = = 
 The golden white @-@ eye differs from the other white @-@ eyes in having large eyes and an outermost primary wing feather that is not reduced ( as it is in the other species ) . It is a large white @-@ eye , 14 cm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) long and weighing around 20 g ( 0 @.@ 7 oz ) . The species has bright , unmistakable plumage , with : an orange @-@ yellow head coupled with a pale eye @-@ ring ; a yellow @-@ green back , wings , and tail ; and golden orange undersides . The bill and legs are also orange . The plumage of both sexes is similar ; the males can be told from the females only when examined in the hand , since the males have longer wings than the females . The juveniles have similar plumage , though duller than the adults ' , with brownish patches on the face and neck and brown @-@ yellow streaks on the breast . Juveniles also have dusky bills and dull legs . 
 The golden white @-@ eye makes a variety of calls . The song is a long raspy warble , rendered as " séé mé @-@ can you séé mé @-@ I can séé <unk> @-@ can you séé mé " . The species also makes rasping shorter calls and whistles when in flocks and in flight . Chicks give plaintive whistles when begging for food from adults . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Like other white @-@ eyes , the golden white @-@ eye is diurnal . In contrast to the bridled white @-@ eye , which forages in groups and is not territorial , the golden white @-@ eye occurs in pairs or small family groups consisting of a breeding pair and fledged young . The golden white @-@ eye is also territorial , and pairs will sing throughout the day in response to neighbouring pairs . Groups can become aggressive when they encounter one another . The golden white @-@ eye is also aggressive towards the smaller bridled white @-@ eye , chasing it away from food and perches and flying through flocks of them in order to disperse them . While it chases other forest passerines , it is less aggressive towards them , and in fact the rufous fantail seeks out the golden white @-@ eye , foraging behind it to snatch insects flushed by the latter species . The golden white @-@ eye is socially dominant over the bridled white @-@ eyes and rufous fantails , but it is subordinate to the Micronesian myzomela and is chased by that species . It is also occasionally chased by the fantails if it approaches their nests too closely . 
 = = = Diet and feeding = = = 
 The golden white @-@ eye is a generalist , feeding on fruit , berries , and insects . Nectar forms part of the diet , and , along with the Micronesian myzomela and the bridled white @-@ eye , the golden white @-@ eye is a pollinator of some trees , albeit not one as important as these other species . Insects may be either gleaned from the bark of trees and from leaves , or caught in the air . Certain tree species are preferred as foraging habitat . The common forest tree <unk> <unk> is the most favoured tree and used more frequently than the equally common <unk> <unk> . There is considerable overlap between this species ' foraging range and that of the bridled white @-@ eye , but the golden white @-@ eye is more generalised in its diet . Within the forest there is some partitioning of niche , with bridled white @-@ eyes ( and Micronesian <unk> ) feeding primarily in the forest canopy , and the golden white @-@ eye feeding in both the canopy and understory of the forest , as well as a variety of smaller trees and bushes . It shares the understory with the rufous fantail , which has a different feeding technique . At a smaller scale additional partitioning occurs . The golden white @-@ eye shows differences in the preferred microhabitat for obtaining insects , for example , feeding in dead leaves and branches , whereas the bridled white @-@ eye prefers gleaning insects on live leaves . It is the most generalised of all the extant forest passerines on Saipan . It has been suggested that the versatility in diet and foraging technique is an adaptation to the challenges presented by typhoons , which can dramatically alter the structure of the forest . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Breeding occurs throughout the year on Saipan , where the species ' nesting behaviour has been studied . The peak breeding period seems to be from March to July . The species is monogamous . The nests are simple undecorated cups of casuarina needles , grasses , and vines . These are placed around 2 @.@ 9 m ( between 1 @.@ 5 and 6 @.@ 5 m ) off the ground in a variety of trees including Casuarina , <unk> , <unk> , Leucaena , and Citrus . The nests are predated by other bird species , specifically Micronesian starlings and collared kingfishers , as well as the introduced green tree skink . 
 The typical clutch size is two eggs , 20 @.@ 3 × 15 @.@ 1 mm in size , which are pale blueish green with red or brown splotches that are concentrated around the wider end . Both sexes share the incubation duties , with each parent incubating for stints of around 25 minutes before being relieved . This species is extremely territorial around the nest , chasing away other birds , including brindled white @-@ eyes , rufous fantails , and other golden white @-@ eyes . From laying it takes about two weeks for the eggs to hatch . The hatchlings are altricial , in other words naked and helpless . Both parents share the brooding and feeding duties , and take away faecal sacs to keep the nest clean . The diet of the chicks is almost exclusively composed of insects and caterpillars . Chicks fledge around 10 – 14 days after hatching . After fledging they may remain with their parents in small groups for some time . 
 = = Threats and conservation = = 
 The range of the golden white @-@ eye has contracted considerably since the arrival of humans in the Mariana Islands . Fossil bones of this species have been found on the nearby islands of Tinian and Rota , and it may once have occurred on Guam and other islands in the Marianas . 
 At present the golden white @-@ eye is very common , and in fact a 1996 study found that their densities on Saipan were among the highest recorded for any bird , up to 2 @,@ 095 birds / km ² ( 8 @.@ 47 per acre ) . It was believed that Saipan cannot sustain a larger population of this white @-@ eye than it already does . A 2009 study , which incorporated results from a 2007 survey , found that the species had declined between 1982 and 2007 , in common with two other species on Saipan , the rufous fantail and the nightingale reed warbler . All three species are insectivorous and were theorised to have declined due to habitat loss . Nevertheless , the species remained relatively abundant , and the current world population is estimated at around 71 @,@ 997 birds . 
 The species is nonetheless evaluated as critically endangered by the IUCN because the population is expected to undergo a rapid decline if the brown tree snake becomes established on Saipan . The primary threat to this species is the brown tree snake , a native of Australia , New Guinea and the Solomon Islands , which eliminated all 12 <unk> species on nearby Guam after being accidentally introduced . The snake has not yet become established on Saipan , one of the two islands that compose the range of the golden white @-@ eye , and which holds the largest population of the species . The isolation of Aguijan makes the introduction of brown tree snakes there unlikely , but the small population there is vulnerable as the island is only 718 ha ( 1774 acres ) in size and a direct hit by a <unk> could wipe them out . Efforts are under way to breed the species in captivity and to prevent the snakes from being introduced and established on Saipan . Six zoos have recently received this species and breeding was expected to begin by 2011 . Success came more quickly , and the first captive birds were bred in 2009 in the North Carolina Zoo . Birds from captive breeding will be introduced on new islands . In addition , 24 birds were translocated from Saipan to the island of <unk> , a predator @-@ free island reserve , in 2011 in the hope of establishing a breeding population . 
 = John Breckinridge ( U.S. Attorney General ) = 
 John Breckinridge ( December 2 , 1760 – December 14 , 1806 ) was a lawyer and politician from the U.S. state of Virginia . He served in the state legislatures of Virginia and Kentucky before being elected to the U.S. Senate and appointed United States Attorney General during the second term of President Thomas Jefferson . He is the progenitor of Kentucky 's Breckinridge political family and the namesake of Breckinridge County , Kentucky . 
 Breckinridge 's father was a local politician , and his mother was a member of the Preston political family . Breckinridge attended the William and Mary College intermittently between 1780 and 1784 ; his attendance was interrupted by the Revolutionary War and his election to the Virginia House of Delegates . One of the youngest members of that body , his political activities acquainted him with many prominent politicians . In 1785 , he married " Polly " Cabell , a member of the Cabell political family . Despite making a comfortable living through a combination of legal and agricultural endeavors , letters from relatives in Kentucky convinced him to move to the western frontier . He established " Cabell 's Dale " , his plantation , near Lexington , Kentucky , in 1793 . 
 Breckinridge was appointed as the state 's attorney general soon after arriving . In November 1797 , he resigned and was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives the next month . As a legislator , he secured passage of a more humane criminal code that abolished the death penalty for all offenses except first @-@ degree murder . On a 1798 trip to Virginia , an intermediary gave him Thomas Jefferson 's Kentucky Resolutions , which denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts . At Jefferson 's request , Breckinridge assumed credit for the modified resolutions he shepherded through the Kentucky General Assembly ; Jefferson 's authorship was not discovered until after Breckinridge 's death . He opposed calling a state constitutional convention in 1799 but was elected as a delegate . Due to his influence , the state 's government remained comparatively aristocratic , maintaining protections for slavery and limiting the power of the electorate . Called the father of the resultant constitution , he emerged from the convention as the acknowledged leader of the state 's Democratic @-@ Republican Party and was selected Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1799 and 1800 . 
 Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1800 , Breckinridge functioned as Jefferson 's floor leader , guiding administration bills through the chamber that was narrowly controlled by his party . Residents of the western frontier called for his nomination as vice president in 1804 , but Jefferson appointed him as U.S. Attorney General in 1805 instead . He was the first cabinet @-@ level official from the West but had little impact before his death from tuberculosis on December 14 , 1806 . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 John Breckinridge 's grandfather , Alexander Breckenridge , immigrated from Ireland to Bucks County , Pennsylvania , around 1728 . In 1740 , the family moved to Augusta County , Virginia , near the city of Staunton . John Breckinridge was born there on December 2 , 1760 , the second of six children of Robert Breckenridge and his second wife , Lettice ( Preston ) Breckenridge . His mother was the daughter of John Preston of Virginia 's Preston political family . Robert Breckinridge had two children by a previous marriage , and it was through one of these half @-@ brothers that John Breckinridge was uncle to future Congressman James D. Breckinridge . A veteran of the French and Indian War , Robert Breckinridge served first as Augusta County 's under @-@ sheriff , then sheriff , then justice of the peace . Soon after John Breckinridge 's birth , the family moved to Botetourt County where Robert Breckinridge became a constable and justice of the peace , as well as serving in the local militia . He died in 1773 , leaving 12 @-@ year @-@ old John 300 acres ( 1 @.@ 2 km2 ) of land , one slave , and half @-@ ownership of another slave . 
 According to his biographer , Lowell H. Harrison , Breckinridge may have attended school , including Augusta Academy ( now Washington and Lee University ) , but any records containing this information have been lost . After his father 's death , the younger Breckinridge helped support the family by selling whiskey , brandy , and hemp . He learned surveying from his uncle , William Preston , and between 1774 and 1779 , he was employed as a recorder in the land office of Fincastle . Preston sought opportunities for his nephew to attend private schools alongside his sons , but such schools were prone to intermittent operation , and Breckinridge 's other responsibilities interfered with his attendance . Preston also nominated Breckinridge as deputy surveyor of Montgomery County , a position he accepted after passing the requisite exam on February 1 , 1780 . Later that year , he joined his cousin , future Kentucky Senator John Brown , at William and Mary College ( now College of William & Mary ) . The instructors who influenced him most were Reverend James Madison and George Wythe . 
 The Revolutionary War forced William and Mary to close in 1781 , as its buildings were used as barracks for British , French , and American troops as each nation successively controlled the college and surrounding area . Although William C. Davis records that Breckinridge had previously served as an ensign in the Botetourt County militia , Harrison notes that the most reliable records of Virginians ' military service do not indicate his participation in the Revolutionary War , but less reliable sources mention him as a subaltern in the Virginia militia . If he enlisted , Harrison speculates that he served in one or two short 1780 militia campaigns supporting Nathanael Greene 's army in southwest Virginia . 
 = = = Early political career = = = 
 Although he had not sought the office and was not old enough to serve , Breckinridge was elected to represent Botetourt County in the Virginia House of Delegates in late 1780 . Legend says he was twice refused his seat because of his age , but his constituents reelected him each time , and he was seated the third time , but official records do not support this . His legislative colleagues included Patrick Henry , Benjamin Harrison , John Tyler , John Taylor of Caroline , George Nicholas , Daniel Boone , and Benjamin Logan . 
 Prevented by British soldiers from meeting at Williamsburg , the House convened May 7 , 1781 in Richmond , but failed to achieve a quorum . Because of British General Charles Cornwallis ' May 10 advance on that city , the legislators adjourned to Charlottesville on May 24 . Breckinridge arrived in Charlottesville on May 28 ; a quorum was present to conduct legislative business through June 3 . The next morning , Jack Jouett rode into the city , warning the legislators that 250 light cavalrymen under Banastre Tarleton were approaching . Legislators quickly adjourned to Staunton and fled for their horses . Days later , they completed the session 's business there . Breckinridge stayed at his mother 's house between sessions , rejoining the legislature in Richmond in November 1781 . Much of the session consisted of adopting resolutions of thanks for individuals who had made that city safe by defeating Cornwallis at Yorktown . 
 Financial difficulties prevented Breckinridge 's return to college . He did not seek reelection in 1782 ; instead , he spent a year earning money by surveying , and was reelected to the House of Delegates in 1783 , joining his legislative colleagues in May . He also joined the Constitutional Society of Virginia ; fellow society members included future U.S. presidents James Madison and James Monroe . The House adjourned June 28 , 1783 , and Breckinridge returned to William and Mary , studying through the end of the year , excepting the legislative session in November and December . With the war over , he urged that no economic or political penalties be imposed on former Loyalists . In contrast to his later political views , he desired a stronger central government than provided for in the Articles of Confederation ; he argued that the national government could not survive unless it could tax its citizens , a power it did not have under the Articles . 
 Financial problems caused Breckinridge to leave William and Mary after the spring semester in 1784 . Because of his studies earlier in the year , he had no time to campaign for reelection to the House of Delegates , so he asked his brother Joseph and his cousin John Preston to campaign on his behalf . Initially , his prospects seemed favorable , but he was beaten by future Virginia Congressman George Hancock . After the defeat , voters from Montgomery County – where Breckinridge had previously been a surveyor – chose him to represent them in the House . He was appointed to the prestigious committees on Propositions and Grievances , Courts of Justice , Religion , and Investigation of the Land Offices . His fellow committee members included Henry Tazewell , Carter Henry Harrison , Edward Carrington , Spencer Roane , John Marshall , Richard Bland Lee , and Wilson Cary Nicholas . Inspired by his legislative service , he spent the summer between legislative sessions studying to become a lawyer . The legislative session focused on domestic issues like whether Virginia should establish a tax to benefit religion in the state . Breckinridge was not associated with any denomination , and his writings indicate that he was opposed to such a tax . Instead , he and James Madison secured approval of a religious liberty bill first proposed by Thomas Jefferson over five years earlier . The legislature rose on January 7 , 1785 , and Breckinridge was admitted to the bar later that year , beginning practice in Charlottesville . 
 = = = Marriage and children = = = 
 On June 28 , 1785 , Breckinridge married Mary Hopkins ( " Polly " ) Cabell , daughter of Joseph Cabell , a member of the Cabell political family . As a dowry , he received a 400 @-@ acre ( 1 @.@ 6 @-@ km2 ) plantation in Albemarle County dubbed " The Glebe " . Nine children were born to the John and Polly Breckinridge – Letitia Preston ( b . 1786 ) , Joseph " Cabell " ( b . 1787 ) , Mary Hopkins ( b . 1790 ) , Robert ( b . 1793 ) , Mary Ann ( b . 1795 ) , John ( b . 1797 ) , Robert Jefferson ( b . 1800 ) , William Lewis ( b . 1803 ) , and James Monroe ( b . 1806 ) . 
 Polly , Cabell , and Letitia all fell ill but survived a smallpox epidemic in 1793 ; however , Mary Hopkins and Robert died . Cabell would later serve as Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives and Kentucky 's Secretary of State . He was the father of U.S. Vice President John C. Breckinridge . The younger John Breckinridge attended Princeton Theological Seminary , served as chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives , and was president of Oglethorpe College ( now Oglethorpe University ) in Georgia . Robert Jefferson was appointed superintendent of public instruction under Governor William Owsley and became known as the father of Kentucky 's public education system . William Lewis became a prominent Presbyterian minister , serving as moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly in 1859 and later as president of Centre College in Danville , Kentucky , and Oakland College in Yale , Mississippi . In 1804 , Letitia married Alfred W. Grayson , son of Virginia Senator William Grayson . Alfred Grayson died in 1808 , and in 1816 , Letitia married Peter Buell Porter , who would later serve as Secretary of War under President John Quincy Adams . 
 The Glebe 's profits were barely enough for Breckinridge 's growing family . His legal career provided enough money for some comforts but required long hours and difficult work . Patrick Henry regularly represented clients opposite Breckinridge , and John Marshall both referred clients to him and asked him to represent his own clients in his absence . Though still interested in politics , Breckinridge refused to campaign for the people 's support . He believed changes were needed to the Articles of Confederation and agreed with much of the proposed U.S. constitution , but he did not support equal representation of the states in the Senate nor the federal judiciary . Heeding the advice of his brother James and his friend , Archibald Stuart , he did not seek election as a delegate to Virginia 's ratification convention . 
 = = Relocation to Kentucky = = 
 Breckinridge 's half @-@ brothers , Andrew and Robert , moved to Kentucky in 1781 , and his brother William followed in 1783 . By 1785 , Andrew and Robert were trustees of Louisville . Their letters described Kentucky 's abundant land and plentiful legal business , in contrast to the crowded bar and scarce unclaimed land in Virginia . By 1788 , Breckinridge was convinced that Kentucky offered him more opportunity , and the next year , he traveled west to seek land on which to construct an estate . Although inaccurate reports of his death reached Virginia , he arrived safely in Kentucky on April 15 , 1789 , and returned to Virginia in June . The following year , he paid 360 pounds sterling for 600 acres ( 2 @.@ 4 km2 ) along the North Elkhorn Creek about 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from present @-@ day Lexington , Kentucky . The land , purchased from his only sister Betsy 's father @-@ in @-@ law , lay adjacent to land owned by his sister , and in 1792 , he purchased an adjacent 1 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 @.@ 0 km2 ) , bringing his total holdings in Kentucky to 1 @,@ 600 acres ( 6 @.@ 5 km2 ) . After the purchase , he instructed William Russell , a friend already living in Kentucky , to find tenants to lease and improve the land . 
 In February 1792 , Breckinridge , a Democratic @-@ Republican , was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives over token opposition . On the date of the election , he wrote to Archibald Stuart , " The People appearing willing to elect , I could have no objection to serve them one Winter in Congress . " Despite this , he left for Kentucky in March 1793 and resigned without serving a day in Congress , which convened on March 4 . He chose the longer but safer route to Kentucky , joining a group of flatboats at Brownsville , Pennsylvania , for the trip down the Monongahela and Ohio rivers to Limestone ( now Maysville , Kentucky ) . His family , along with 25 slaves , arrived in April and established their plantation , Cabell 's Dale . By the time of Breckinridge 's move , he owned 30 @,@ 000 acres ( 120 km2 ) in Kentucky . 
 = = Domestic life in Kentucky = = 
 When he arrived in Kentucky , much of Breckinridge 's land was occupied by tenant farmers whose leases had not yet expired . He planted rye and wheat on 20 acres ( 0 @.@ 081 km2 ) of unleased land and sent 11 slaves and an overseer to clear land for the fall planting . Eventually , his crops at Cabell 's Dale included corn , wheat , rye , barley , hay , grass seed , and hemp , but he refused to grow tobacco , a major cash crop , which he found too vulnerable to over @-@ cultivation . He also bred thoroughbred horses , planted an orchard , and practiced law . He engaged in land speculation , particularly in the Northwest Territory , and at various times owned interests in iron and salt works , but these ventures were never very successful . 
 As his plantation became more productive , Breckinridge became interested in ways to sell his excess goods . On August 26 , 1793 , he became a charter member of the Democratic Society of Kentucky , which lobbied the federal government to secure unrestricted use of the Mississippi River from Spain . Breckinridge was elected chairman , Robert Todd and John Bradford were chosen as vice @-@ chairmen , and Thomas Todd and Thomas Bodley were elected as clerks . Breckinridge authored a tract entitled Remonstrance of the Citizens West of the Mountains to the President and Congress of the United States and may have also written To the Inhabitants of the United States West of the Allegany ( sic ) and <unk> ( sic ) Mountains . He pledged funding to French minister Edmond @-@ Charles Genêt 's proposed military operation against Spain , but Genêt was recalled before it could be executed . Although alarmed that frontier settlers might initiate war with Spain , President George Washington made no immediate attempt to obtain use of the Mississippi , which the society maintained was " the natural right of the citizens of this Commonwealth " . The resistance of the eastern states , particularly Federalist politicians , caused Breckinridge to reconsider his support of a strong central government . 
 Breckinridge was also concerned with easing overland transport of goods to Virginia . In mid @-@ 1795 , he , Robert Barr , Elijah Craig , and Harry Toulmin formed a committee to raise funds for a road connecting the Cumberland Gap to central Kentucky . Breckinridge was disappointed with the quality of the route , which was finished in late 1796 , concluding that the individual maintaining it was keeping most of the tolls instead of using them for the road 's upkeep . 
 Breckinridge was also interested in education . Before moving to Kentucky , he accumulated a substantial library of histories , biographies , law and government texts , and classical literature . Frequently , he allowed aspiring lawyers and students access to the library , which was one of the most extensive in the west . He also provided funding for a municipal library in Lexington . His lobbying for a college to be established in Lexington bore fruit with the opening of Transylvania Seminary ( now Transylvania University ) in 1788 . He was elected to the seminary 's board of trustees on October 9 , 1793 , and supported hiring Harry Toulmin as president in February 1794 and consolidating the seminary with Kentucky Academy in 1796 . Conservatives on the board and in the Kentucky General Assembly forced Toulmin – a liberal Unitarian – to resign in 1796 , and Breckinridge 's enthusiasm for his trusteeship waned . He attended board meetings less frequently and resigned in late 1797 . 
 = = Kentucky Attorney General = = 
 Kentucky needed qualified governmental leaders , and on December 19 , 1793 , Kentucky Governor Isaac Shelby appointed Breckinridge attorney general . Three weeks after accepting , he was offered the post of District Attorney for the Federal District of Kentucky , but he declined . Secretary of State Edmund Randolph directed Shelby to prevent French agents in Kentucky from organizing an expedition against Spanish Louisiana . On Breckinridge 's advice , Shelby responded that he lacked the authority to interfere . Lack of funding prevented the expedition , but Shelby 's noncommittal response helped prompt passage of the Neutrality Act of 1794 which outlawed participation by U.S. citizens in such expeditions . 
 In November 1794 , the Democratic @-@ Republicans nominated Breckinridge to succeed John Edwards in the U.S. Senate . Federalists were generally unpopular in Kentucky , but the signing of Pinckney 's Treaty – which temporarily secured use Kentucky 's of the Mississippi River – and Anthony Wayne 's expedition against the Indians in the Northwest Territory prompted a surge of support for the federal government in Kentucky . The election 's first ballot reflected this , as Federalist candidate Humphrey Marshall received 18 votes to Breckinridge 's 16 , John Fowler 's 8 , and 7 votes for the incumbent Edwards . On the runoff ballot , Marshall was elected over Breckinridge by a vote of 28 – 22 . Harrison posits that Marshall 's incumbency in the General Assembly may have aided his election but notes that Marshall downplayed its significance . 
 In May 1796 , Kentucky 's gubernatorial electors convened to choose Shelby 's successor . Their votes were split among four candidates ; frontiersman Benjamin Logan received 21 votes , Baptist minister James Garrard received 17 , Thomas Todd received 14 , and Breckinridge 's cousin , Senator John Brown , received 1 . The Kentucky Constitution did not specify whether a plurality or a majority was required for election , but the electors held a runoff vote . Most of Todd 's supporters voted for Garrard , and he won the election . Breckinridge claimed he had no authority to intervene but declared that , as a private citizen , he believed Logan should be governor . The state senate was authorized to settle disputed elections , but they , too , refused to intervene . Breckinridge resigned as attorney general on November 30 , 1797 ; the extension of the attorney general 's duties to include representing the state in federal district court as well as the Kentucky Court of Appeals , and reluctance to serve under Garrard after publicly declaring he had no right to his office may have contributed to the decision . A month later , he declared his candidacy to fill a vacancy in the Fayette County delegation to the Kentucky House of Representatives . Of the 1 @,@ 323 votes cast , he garnered 594 ( 45 % ) , the most of any of the six candidates in the race . 
 = = Kentucky House of Representatives = = 
 Breckinridge pressed to reform the state 's criminal code , which was based on the English system and imposed the death penalty for over 200 different crimes . Inspired by Thomas Jefferson 's failed attempt to reform Virginia 's code , he first asked the Lexington Democratic Society to study ways to make punishments more proportional to crimes in November 1793 . By 1796 , he was drafting a new code based on the principles that criminals should be rehabilitated , victims should be compensated for their injury , the public should be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the criminal , and the punishment 's severity should serve as a deterrent for would @-@ be offenders . In January 1798 , he introduced his proposed code in the General Assembly . A month later , the Assembly reformed the code , abolishing the death penalty for every crime except first @-@ degree murder . 
 = = = Kentucky Resolutions = = = 
 In August , Breckinridge traveled to Virginia 's Sweet Springs to improve his health . He visited family and friends while there , but the exact dates and locations he visited are not known . At some point , he obtained a draft of resolutions written by Vice President Thomas Jefferson denouncing the recently @-@ enacted Alien and Sedition Acts . Jefferson wished to keep his authorship secret , and Breckinridge accepted credit for them during his life . In 1814 , John Taylor revealed Jefferson 's authorship ; Breckinridge 's grandson , John C. Breckinridge , wrote Jefferson for confirmation of Taylor 's claims . <unk> that the passage of time and his failing memory might cause him to inaccurately recount the details , Jefferson responded that he , Breckinridge , Wilson Nicholas , and possibly James Madison met at Monticello , at a date Jefferson could not recall , to discuss the need for resolutions denouncing the Alien and Sedition Acts . They decided that Jefferson would pen the resolutions and that Breckinridge would introduce them in the Kentucky legislature upon his return to that state . 
 Letters between Nicholas and Jefferson indicate a different series of events . In a letter dated October 4 , 1798 , Nicholas informed Jefferson that he had given " a copy of the resolutions you sent me " to Breckinridge , who would introduce them in Kentucky . The letter also indicated that this was a deviation from the original plan to deliver the draft to a legislator in North Carolina for introduction in the legislature there . Nicholas felt that recipient was too closely associated with Jefferson , risking his being discovered as the resolutions ' author . According to Nicholas , Breckinridge wanted to discuss the draft with Jefferson , but Nicholas advised against the meeting , fearing it could implicate Jefferson . A subsequent letter from Jefferson expressed his approval of Nicholas ' actions . Lowell Harrison notes that after Breckinridge left Virginia , his contacts with Jefferson were few until his election to the Senate in 1801 . Harrison considered it unlikely that Jefferson was mistaken about a meeting between the two to discuss a matter as important as the resolutions , positing that Jefferson may have met separately with Breckinridge and Nicholas to discuss the resolutions , and that the meeting with Breckinridge was kept secret from Nicholas . Because of the uncertainty surrounding Breckinridge 's activities in Virginia in 1798 , the extent of his influence on Jefferson 's original draft of the resolutions is unknown . 
 In Garrard 's November 5 , 1798 State of the Commonwealth address , he encouraged the General Assembly to declare its views on the Alien and Sedition Acts . Breckinridge was chosen as chairman of a three @-@ person committee to carry out the governor 's charge . The resolutions that the committee brought to the floor on November 10 became known as the Kentucky Resolutions . The first seven were exactly as Jefferson had written them , but Breckinridge modified the last two , eliminating Jefferson 's suggestion of nullifying the unpopular acts . During the debate on the House floor , Breckinridge endorsed nullification if Congress would not repeal the acts after a majority of states declared their opposition to them . Federalist William Murray led opposition to the resolutions in the House but was the only dissenting vote on five of the nine ; John Pope led similarly unsuccessful Federalist opposition in the Senate . Upon concurrence of both houses , Garrard signed the resolutions . 
 Federalist state legislatures , primarily those north of the Potomac River , sent the Kentucky General Assembly negative responses to the resolutions . Nicholas convinced Jefferson that Kentucky should adopt a second set of resolutions affirming the first , lest the lack of a reply be seen acquiescence . Jefferson refused to compose these resolutions , maintaining that there were sufficiently talented individuals in Kentucky to compose them and fearing still that he would be discovered as the author of the first set . Breckinridge , chosen Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives at the outset of the 1799 session , took on the task , drafting resolutions reasserting the original principles and endorsing nullification . The resolutions unanimously passed the House . The Federalist minority in the Senate opposed them , especially the endorsement of nullification , but that chamber also adopted the resolutions as written . Breckinridge 's presumed authorship of the original resolutions and his subsequent defense of them caused his popularity to soar in Kentucky . 
 = = = Kentucky Constitution of 1799 = = = 
 Some Kentucky citizens were already displeased with parts of the state 's constitution , and the disputed gubernatorial election of 1796 had added to the enthusiasm of those calling for a constitutional convention to revise it . Breckinridge opposed such a call , fearing changes would imperil his wealth and power . John Breckinridge asked , " Where is the difference whether I am robbed of my horse by a highway @-@ man , or of my slave by a set of people called a Convention ? … If they can by one experiment emancipate our slaves ; the same principle pursued , will enable them at a second experiment to extinguish our land titles ; both are held by rights equally sound . " The desire for a convention was so strong , even in aristocratic Fayette County , that Breckinridge 's position nearly cost him his seat in the legislature . Seeking election to a full term in May 1798 , he was the seventh @-@ highest vote @-@ getter , securing the last of Fayette County 's seats in the legislature by only eight votes . Despite the efforts of conservatives like Breckinridge and George Nicholas , in late 1798 , the General Assembly called a convention for July 22 , 1799 . Delegates to the convention were to be elected in May 1799 , and the conservatives immediately began organizing slates of candidates that would represent their interests . Popular because of his role in securing adoption of the Kentucky Resolutions , Breckinridge was among the six conservative candidates promoted in Fayette County , all of whom were elected . Out of the fifty @-@ eight men who arrived in Frankfort in late July as convention delegates , fifty @-@ seven owned slaves and fifty held substantial property . Between the election and the convention , Breckinridge and Judge Caleb Wallace worked with Nicholas ( who did not seek election as a delegate ) to draft resolutions that Breckinridge would introduce at the convention in an attempt to steer the proceedings toward conservative positions . 
 The largest group of delegates at the convention – about 18 in number – were aristocrats who advocated protection of their wealth and status , including instituting voice voting in the legislature ( which left legislators vulnerable to intimidation ) , safeguarding legal slavery , and limiting the power of the electorate . A smaller group led by Green Clay and Robert Johnson consisted mostly of planters who opposed most limits on the power of the legislature , which they believed was superior to the executive and judicial branches . A third group , led by future governor John Adair , agreed with the notion of legislative supremacy , but opposed limits on other branches of the government . The smallest group was the most populist and was led by John Bailey . The conservative faction strengthened the previous constitution 's slavery protections by denying suffrage to free blacks and mulattoes . Legislative apportionment based on population , the addition of a lieutenant governor , and voice voting of the legislature – all issues advocated by Breckinridge – were also adopted . He was unable to preserve the electoral college that elected the governor and state senators , but the direct election of these officers was balanced by a provision that county sheriffs and judges be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate . Attempts to make judicial decisions subject to legislative approval were defeated after Breckinridge defended the extant judicial system . He was also the architect of the constitution 's provisions for amendment , which made changing the document difficult , but not entirely impossible . Because of his leading role in the convention , Breckinridge was regarded as the father of the resultant constitution , which was ratified in 1799 , and emerged from the convention as the leader of his party . He was reelected as Speaker of the House in 1800 . 
 = = U.S. Senator = = 
 On November 20 , 1800 , the Kentucky General Assembly elected Breckinridge to the U.S. Senate by a vote of 68 – 13 over John Adair . He was eligible for the special congressional session called for March 4 , 1801 , but his summons to the session remained undelivered at the Lexington post office until March 5 , and he consequently missed the entire session . When he left for Washington , D.C. , late in the year , he left several of his pending legal cases in the hands of rising attorney Henry Clay , who would later become U.S. Secretary of State . 
 Although Democratic @-@ Republicans held a narrow majority in the Senate , the Federalist senators were both experienced and devoted their cause . Breckinridge acted as floor leader for the Democratic @-@ Republicans and newly elected president , Thomas Jefferson . His proposed repeal of the Federalist @-@ supported Judicial Act of 1801 , which had increased the number of federal courts and judges , was particularly controversial . On January 4 , 1802 , he presented caseload data to argue that the new courts and judges were unnecessary . Federalist leader Gouverneur Morris countered that the proposal was unconstitutional ; once established , courts were inviolate , he maintained . On January 20 , Federalist Jonathan Dayton moved to return the bill to a committee to consider amendments . South Carolina 's John E. Colhoun , a Democratic @-@ Republican , voted with the Federalists , and the result was a 15 – 15 tie . Empowered to break the tie , Jefferson 's vice president , Aaron Burr , voted with the Federalists . The five @-@ man committee consisted of three Federalists , enough to prevent the bill 's return to the floor , but when Vermont Senator Stephen R. Bradley , who had traveled home because of a family illness , returned to the chamber , the Democratic @-@ Republicans regained a majority and introduced a successful discharge petition . In one last attempt to derail the legislation in debate , Federalists argued that the judiciary would strike down the repeal as unconstitutional ; Breckinridge denied the notion that the courts had the power to invalidate an act of Congress . On February 3 , the Senate repealed the act by a vote of 16 – 15 , with the House concurring a month later . 
 = = = Louisiana Purchase = = = 
 Breckinridge advocated internal improvements and formed a coalition of legislators from South Carolina , Georgia , Tennessee and Kentucky to support a system of roads connecting the Southern coastal states with the western frontier , but the routes they proposed proved impossible to construct with the technology available at the time . Spanish revocation of Kentucky 's right of deposit at New Orleans – in violation of Pinckney 's Treaty – further frustrated and angered frontier residents . Although many desired war with Spain , Jefferson believed a diplomatic resolution was possible and urged restraint . Federalists , seeking to divide the Democratic @-@ Republicans and curry favor with the West , abandoned their usual advocacy of peace . Pennsylvania Federalist James Ross introduced a measure allocating $ 5 million and raising 50 @,@ 000 militiamen to seize the Louisiana Territory from Spain . Cognizant of Jefferson 's desire for more time , Breckinridge offered a substitute resolution on February 23 , 1803 , allocating 80 @,@ 000 troops and unlimited funds for the potential invasion of New Orleans , but he left their use at the discretion of the president . Breckinridge 's resolution was adopted after a heated debate . 
 Before an invasion became necessary , U.S. ambassadors learned that Spain had ceded Louisiana to France via the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso , and France offered to sell the territory to the U.S. Robert R. Livingston and James Monroe , U.S. ministers to France , agreed to the purchase , even though they had not been given the authority to do so . Jefferson was pleased with the purchase , but feared he had no constitutional authority to effect it . In an August 12 , 1803 letter to Breckinridge , Jefferson discussed his constitutional misgivings about the Louisiana Purchase and proposed that Breckinridge introduce a simple constitutional amendment in the Senate : " Louisiana , as ceded by France to the U.S. , is made a part of the U.S. " Breckinridge ignored the proposed amendment and immediately formed a coalition of western senators to approve the purchase . 
 After the purchase was approved , Jefferson drafted a system of governing the newly acquired territory . Fearing that the Federalists would oppose any system he had devised , he delivered his draft to Breckinridge and asked him to introduce it in the Senate as his own . To maintain the ruse , Breckinridge moved that a committee be formed to recommend a plan for governing Louisiana Territory . Working through the committee , he brought Jefferson 's plan to the Senate floor with its essentials intact . Because the plan provided for the taxation of Louisiana residents without giving them representation in Congress , Federalists and some Democratic @-@ Republicans opposed it . Nevertheless , it passed by a vote of 26 – 6 . 
 = = = Consideration for the vice presidency = = = 
 By July 1803 , citizens of the western states , desiring more representation in the federal government and intent on breaking the pattern of nominating a Virginians and New Yorkers for most important federal offices , were advocating Breckinridge 's nomination as vice president in the 1804 presidential election . Thomas Jefferson was expected to be reelected , but most Democratic @-@ Republicans had grown disenchanted with Vice President Aaron Burr ; he would not be Jefferson 's running mate . Breckinridge 's service as Senate floor leader made him a natural choice . 
 The Democratic @-@ Republican congressional caucus convened February 25 , 1804 . Contrary to previous conventions , the proceedings were open and formal . Afraid that taking vice presidential nominations from the floor would precipitate divisive oratory , chairman Stephen Bradley called for open balloting for the nomination . New York 's George Clinton received a majority with 67 votes ; Breckinridge garnered 20 votes , mostly from western delegates , and the remaining votes were scattered among 4 other candidates . Historian James C. Klotter concluded that the <unk> felt a ticket composed of Jefferson , a Virginian , and Breckinridge , a former Virginian , made little political sense . Breckinridge acceded to the choice ; some reports hold that he asked his colleagues not to vote for him at all . Before the caucus adjourned , a thirteen @-@ man committee was formed to promote the election of the Democratic @-@ Republican ticket ; Breckinridge represented Kentucky on the committee . 
 Westerners expressed dissent over Clinton 's nomination instead of their preferred candidate . The June 29 , 1804 edition of Philadelphia 's Independent Gazetteer carried an editorial , signed " True American " , that denounced the Virginia – New York coalition , attacked Clinton as too old , and called for electors to vote for Breckinridge for vice president . Potential electors in western states pledged to carry out " True American " ' s proposal . Allan B. Magruder attempted to warn Breckinridge in advance of the editorial 's publication , but his letter – dated June 23 , 1804 – did not reach Breckinridge until July 1 . On July 5 , Breckinridge published a response in the Kentucky Palladium denouncing the proposal and encouraging electors to vote for the Democratic @-@ Republican slate as nominated . He requested that all newspapers that had printed the " True American " editorial also print his response . 
 In the same edition that carried Breckinridge 's response , Daniel Bradford , editor of the Kentucky Gazette , penned an editorial revealing Breckinridge 's close friend , William Stevenson , as the author of the " True American " article and noting that Breckinridge had waited nearly a week to publish a response , and claiming the delay was intended to allow him to gauge public sentiment before denouncing Stevenson 's proposal . Bradford had been at odds with Breckinridge since the 1799 constitutional convention , and his dislike intensified when Breckinridge refused to use his influence to gain appointments for Bradford 's relatives – John Bradford and James Bradford – as Public Printer of the United States and Secretary of Louisiana Territory , respectively . Bradford 's claims were quickly endorsed by anonymous editorial writers in newspapers across the west . 
 Stevenson swore under oath that Breckinridge had no part in composing the " True American " article . Breckinridge publicly stated that Bradford 's brother , Charles , had shown him a draft of the " True American " editorial prior to its publication and asked his opinion of it ; Breckinridge advised him not to publish it , and Bradford temporarily obliged . An illness , Breckinridge said , had confined him to his home at the time of the editorial 's publication , and he was not aware that the Independent Gazetteer had printed it until he attended the court at Frankfort days later ; he immediately returned home and composed his rebuttal . In light of this evidence , few still maintained the credibility of the reports in the Kentucky Gazette by the time of the election . Every Kentucky elector voted for both Jefferson and Clinton . 
 = = = Other Senate matters = = = 
 After the Louisiana Purchase , Breckinridge focused on securing a vote to present the Twelfth Amendment to the states for ratification . He did not agree with all the changes effected by the amendment , the primary purpose of which was to direct presidential electors to vote separately for president and vice president ; he supported abolishing the electoral college , electing both officials by popular vote . Democratic @-@ Republicans wanted the amendment adopted before the 1804 election to avoid Jefferson 's being saddled with a hostile vice president again , and Breckinridge announced his support for the amendment in late October . With several members of his party absent , he would not be able to secure the two @-@ thirds majority needed to send the amendment to the states for ratification . Recognizing this fact , Federalists pushed for an immediate vote , putting Breckinridge in the position of trying to delay a vote on a measure both he and his constituents supported . Debate began on November 23 after several Democratic @-@ Republicans had returned . South Carolina Federalist Pierce Butler contended that the amendment would allow large states to pick the president ; James Jackson , a Democratic @-@ Republican from Georgia , countered by taunting , " Never will there be a Federal President or Vice @-@ President again elected , to the end of time . " Federalists moved adjournment at 6 : 00 p.m. on December 2 , but Breckinridge , determined to hold a vote that night , blocked the move and took the floor for the first time in days . By 10 : 00 p.m. , senators clamored for a vote , and the measure was approved 22 – 10 . State legislatures quickly acted on the amendment , and by September 23 , 1804 , it was declared in force for the upcoming election . 
 Other business in the session included creating a special fund that would allow Jefferson to recover the USS Philadelphia , which had been captured off the coast of northern Africa , and the repeal of the Bankruptcy Act of 1800 ; Breckinridge supported the passage of both measures . He feared that passage of an act making permanent the pay raises for executive administrative personnel first enacted in 1799 would hurt his party in the upcoming elections , especially in the House , but the act passed and there was no significant backlash at the polls . Robert Wright 's measure adjourning Congress to Baltimore , Maryland , in protest of legislators ' poor accommodations in Washington , D.C. , was defeated by a vote of 9 – 19 , but Breckinridge considered the issue of moving the U.S. capital worthy of further study . Breckinridge supported the successful impeachment of federal judge John Pickering and also served on the Senate committee that prepared the rules governing the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase . The latter impeachment was widely seen as politically motivated , and some Democratic @-@ Republicans joined the Federalist minority in voting for acquittal . <unk> were obtained on only three of the eight articles of impeachment , and each of those fell at least three votes short of the required two @-@ thirds majority . Breckinridge and three other Democratic @-@ Republicans voted to convict on every article except the fifth , on which every senator sided with Chase . 
 = = U.S. Attorney General = = 
 When U.S. Attorney General Levi Lincoln resigned in December 1804 , Jefferson and Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin sought a replacement . Virginia 's John Thomson Mason , Gallatin 's first choice , declined the appointment . U.S. Navy Secretary Robert Smith desired the office , and Jefferson agreed to appoint him , contingent upon finding a suitable replacement for Smith as Secretary of the Navy . Jefferson appointed Massachusetts Congressman Jacob Crowninshield to replace Smith , and both appointments were confirmed by the Senate March 3 , 1805 . Crowninshield refused his appointment , however , and Smith was forced to remain as Secretary of the Navy . Jefferson then offered the position to Breckinridge , Gallatin 's second choice . Breckinridge resigned from the Senate on August 7 , 1805 to accept the appointment . He was the first U.S. cabinet @-@ level official from west of the Allegheny Mountains , and his appointment boosted Jefferson 's popularity in the west . Lowell Harrison called the appointment a mistake by Jefferson , not because Breckinridge lacked any qualifications , but because Jefferson was not able to replace his leadership in the Senate . He noted that after Breckinridge 's departure from the chamber , the Federalist minority experienced a revival of influence under the leadership of Connecticut 's Uriah Tracy . 
 Stopping to visit with friends en route to Washington , D.C. , Breckinridge arrived on December 7 , 1805 . His nomination was confirmed by the Senate on December 20 . He was influential in Jefferson 's infrequent cabinet meetings , where he served as the lone voice of the west . His most notable advisory opinion – that no local government in the Territory of Orleans had the power to tax federal property there – was upheld in the Supreme Court by Chief Justice John Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland . He was sworn in to represent the federal government before the Supreme Court when it convened – about a week late because of the illness of several justices – on February 12 , 1806 . He was spared the awkwardness of practicing before a judge he had voted to impeach because Samuel Chase was absent for the Court 's entire six @-@ week term . The court heard only six cases during the term ; most of them were cases Breckinridge had inherited from his predecessor , and Harrison wrote that none were of lasting importance . Cases such as Maley v. Shattuck involved international maritime law – an area with which Breckinridge was not familiar – and arose from the Napoleonic Wars , which complicated neutral American trade with both Great Britain and France . During the term , Breckinridge lost four cases , won one , and the justices sent one back for retrial in a lower court . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Breckinridge returned to Cabell 's Dale in early 1806 and fell ill in June . In July , he visited Kentucky 's Olympian Springs , hoping it would aid his recovery , but it did not . Doctors disagreed on the cause of his illness , with diagnoses ranging from typhus fever to stomach ailments . He attempted to return to Washington , D.C. , on October 22 , but while his horse was being prepared for the journey , he collapsed in pain and had to be helped back inside . Friends and relatives hoped for a recovery that never came , and he died on December 14 , 1806 . The cause of death was eventually determined to be tuberculosis . According to family tradition , Polly Breckinridge was so distraught over her husband 's death that she went blind from her incessant crying . Breckinridge was first buried at Cabell 's Dale on December 16 but was later reinterred in Lexington Cemetery . 
 At the time of his death , Breckinridge owned over 20 @,@ 000 acres ( 81 km2 ) of land , and his net worth was estimated at more than $ 20 @,@ 000 . With a workforce of nearly 70 slaves , he was one of the largest slaveholders in the state . The breeding of horses and mules at Cabell 's Dale had become more profitable than selling the excess crops raised there . His daughter , Mary Ann , and her husband , David Castleman , inherited the horse and mule breeding operations , which eventually became the thoroughbred stable of Castleton Lyons . Breckinridge County , Kentucky , created from a portion of Hardin County in 1799 , was named in Breckinridge 's honor .

Intent on returning home to Earth to face trial for their actions in the previous film , the former crew of the USS Enterprise finds the planet in grave danger from an alien probe attempting to contact now @-@ extinct humpback whales . The crew travel to Earth 's past to find whales who can answer the probe 's call . 
 After directing The Search for Spock , cast member Leonard Nimoy was asked to direct the next feature , and given greater freedom regarding the film 's content . Nimoy and producer Harve Bennett conceived a story with an environmental message and no clear @-@ cut villain . Dissatisfied with the first screenplay produced by Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes , Paramount hired The Wrath of Khan writer and director Nicholas Meyer . Meyer and Bennett divided the story between them and wrote different parts of the script , requiring approval from Nimoy , lead actor William Shatner , and Paramount . 
 Principal photography commenced on February 24 , 1986 . Unlike previous Star Trek films , The Voyage Home was shot extensively on location ; many real settings and buildings were used as stand @-@ ins for scenes set around and in the city of San Francisco . Special effects firm Industrial Light & Magic ( ILM ) assisted in post @-@ production and the film 's special effects . Few of the humpback whales in the film were real : ILM devised full @-@ size animatronics and small motorized models to stand in for the real creatures . 
 The Voyage Home premiered on November 26 , 1986 , in North America , becoming the top @-@ grossing film in the weekend box office . The film 's humor and unconventional story were well received by critics , fans of the series and the general audience . It was financially successful , earning $ 133 million worldwide . 
 The film earned several awards and four Academy Award nominations for its cinematography and audio . It was dedicated to the crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger , which broke up 73 seconds after takeoff on the morning of January 28 , 1986 . Principal photography for The Voyage Home began four weeks after Challenger and her crew were lost . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In <unk> , a large cylindrical probe moves through space , sending out an indecipherable signal and disabling the power of ships it passes . As it takes up orbit around Earth , its signal disables the global power grid and generates planetary storms , creating catastrophic , sun @-@ blocking cloud cover . Starfleet Command sends out a planetary distress call and warns starships not to approach Earth . 
 On the planet Vulcan , the former officers of the USS Enterprise are living in exile ( after the events of Star Trek III : The Search for Spock ) . Accompanied by the Vulcan Spock , still recovering from his resurrection , the crew — except for Saavik , who remains on Vulcan — take their captured Klingon Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey starship ( nicknamed the Bounty , after the Royal Navy ship ) and head to Earth to face trial for their theft and destruction of Enterprise . Hearing Starfleet 's warning , Spock determines that the probe 's signal matches the song of extinct humpback whales , and that the object will continue to wreak havoc until its call is answered . The crew uses their ship to travel back in time via a slingshot maneuver around the Sun , planning to return with a whale to answer the alien signal . 
 Arriving in 1986 , the crew finds their ship 's power drained . Hiding their ship in San Francisco 's Golden Gate Park using its cloaking device , the crew split up to accomplish several tasks : Admiral James T. Kirk and Spock attempt to locate humpback whales , while Montgomery Scott , Leonard McCoy , and Hikaru Sulu construct a tank to hold the whales they need for a return to the 23rd century . Uhura and Pavel Chekov are tasked to find a nuclear reactor , whose energy leakage will enable their ship 's power to be restored . 
 Kirk and Spock discover a pair of whales in the care of Dr. Gillian Taylor at a Sausalito museum , and learn they will soon be released into the wild . Kirk tells her of his mission and asks for the tracking frequency for the whales , but she refuses to cooperate . Meanwhile , Scott , McCoy , and Sulu trade the formula of transparent aluminum for the materials needed for the whale tank . Uhura and Chekov locate a nuclear @-@ powered ship , the aircraft carrier Enterprise . They collect the power they need , but are discovered on board . Uhura is beamed back but Chekov is captured and severely injured in an escape attempt . 
 Taylor learns the whales have been released early , and goes to Kirk for assistance . Taylor , Kirk , and McCoy rescue Chekov and return to the now @-@ recharged Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey . After transporting the whales aboard the ship , the crew returns with Taylor to their own time . On approaching Earth , the ship loses power and comes down in San Francisco Bay . Once released , the whales respond to the probe 's signal , causing the object to reverse its effects on Earth and return to the depths of space . All charges against the Enterprise crew are dropped , save one for insubordination : for disobeying a superior officer , Kirk is given a demotion from Admiral to Captain . The crew departs on their ship , the newly christened USS Enterprise ( NCC @-@ 1701 @-@ A ) , and leaves on a new mission .

 William Shatner portrays Admiral James T. Kirk , former captain of the Enterprise . Shatner was unwilling to reprise the role of Kirk until he received a salary of $ 2 million and the promise of directing the next film . Shatner described The Voyage Home 's comic quality as one " that verges on tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek but isn 't ; it 's as though the characters within the play have a great deal of joy about themselves , a joy of living [ and ] you play it with the reality you would in a kitchen @-@ sink drama written for today 's life " . 
 Leonard Nimoy plays Spock , who was resurrected by the effects of a powerful terraforming device and had his " living spirit " restored to his body in the previous film . DeForest Kelley portrays Doctor Leonard McCoy , who is given many of the film 's comedic lines ; Kelley biographer Terry Lee Rioux wrote that in the film " he seemed to be playing straight man to himself . " On Earth McCoy was paired with engineer Montgomery Scott ( James Doohan ) , as producer Harve Bennett felt that Kelley worked well with Doohan 's " old vaudeville comic " . The other members of the Enterprise crew include George Takei as helmsman Hikaru Sulu , Walter Koenig as Commander Pavel Chekov , and Nichelle Nichols as Uhura . Koenig commented that Chekov was a " delight " to play in this film because he worked best in comedic situations . 
 Catherine Hicks plays Doctor Gillian Taylor , a biologist on 20th century Earth . During production a rumor circulated that the part had been created after Shatner demanded a love interest , a regular aspect of the television series that was absent from the first three films . Writer Nicholas Meyer denied this , saying that the inspiration for Taylor came from a woman biologist featured in a National Geographic documentary about whales . Nimoy chose Hicks after inviting her to lunch with Shatner and witnessing a chemistry between the two . 
 Majel Barrett reprises her role as Christine Chapel , the director of Starfleet Command 's medical services . Many of her scenes — some reportedly very large — were omitted in the final cut , angering the actress . Her final role in the film consists of one line of dialogue and a reaction shot . Mark Lenard and Jane Wyatt play Ambassador Sarek and Amanda Grayson , respectively , Spock 's parents . Wyatt commented that although she generally disliked working with actors who were directing , she found Nimoy an exception because he could concentrate on being part of the cast as well as setting up the crew . Robin Curtis reprises the role of Saavik , a Starfleet lieutenant . Saavik 's role is minimal in the film — originally , she was intended to remain behind on Vulcan because she was pregnant after she had mated with the younger Spock in Star Trek III : The Search for Spock . In the final cut of the film , all references to her condition were dropped . 
 The film contains several cameos and smaller roles . Alex <unk> plays Dr. Nichols , plant manager of <unk> . Madge Sinclair makes an uncredited appearance as captain of the USS Saratoga ( the first female Federation starship captain to appear in Star Trek ) . Musician Jane <unk> and tennis star Vijay Amritraj appear as Starfleet officers seen briefly on video screens at Starfleet Command . John Schuck appears as a Klingon ambassador , Robert Ellenstein as the Federation President , Michael Berryman as an alien display officer at Starfleet Command , and Brock Peters as Fleet Admiral Cartwright . Grace Lee Whitney reprises her role as Janice Rand from the original television series .

 Before The Search for Spock was released , its director Leonard Nimoy was asked to return to direct the next film in the franchise . Whereas Nimoy had been under certain constraints in filming the previous picture , Paramount gave the director greater freedom for the sequel . " [ Paramount ] said flat out that they wanted my vision , " Nimoy recalled . In contrast to the drama @-@ heavy and operatic events of the three previous Star Trek features , Nimoy and producer Harve Bennett wanted a lighter movie that did not have a clear @-@ cut villain . As William Shatner was unwilling to return , Nimoy and Bennett spent eight months considering a prequel concept by Ralph Winter about the characters at Starfleet Academy , before Shatner received a pay increase and signed on to star . Nimoy and Shatner each received $ 2 @.@ 5 million for the film , less than their original demands , but the film cast 's rising salaries caused Paramount to create a new television series , Star Trek : The Next Generation ( 1987 ) , with less @-@ expensive , lesser @-@ known actors . 
 Despite Shatner 's doubts , Nimoy and Bennett selected a time travel story in which the Enterprise crew encounters a problem that could only be fixed by something only available in the present day ( the Star Trek characters ' past ) . They considered ideas about violin makers and oil drillers , or a disease that had its cure destroyed with the rainforests . " But the depiction of thousands of sick and dying people seemed rather gruesome for our light @-@ hearted film , and the thought of our crew taking a 600 @-@ year round trip just to bring back a snail darter wasn 't all that thrilling , " explained Nimoy . The director read a book on extinct animals and conceived the storyline that was eventually adopted . Nimoy hit upon the idea of humpback whales after talking with a friend — their song added mystery to the story , and their size added logistical challenges the heroes would have to overcome . 
 Nimoy approached Beverly Hills Cop writer Daniel Petrie , Jr. to write the screenplay when a concept that executive producer Jeffrey Katzenberg described as " either the best or worst idea in the world " arose — Star Trek fan Eddie Murphy wanted a starring role . Nimoy and Murphy acknowledged his part would attract non @-@ Star Trek fans to the franchise following the rising popularity of Murphy , but it also meant the film might be ridiculed . Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes were hired to write a script with Murphy as a college professor who believes in aliens and likes to play whale songs . Murphy disliked the part , explaining he wanted to play an alien or a Starfleet officer , and chose to make The Golden Child — a decision Murphy later said was a mistake . The character intended for Murphy was combined with those of a marine biologist and a female reporter to become Gillian Taylor . 
 Paramount was dissatisfied with the script , so its head of production Dawn Steele asked Nicholas Meyer , the writer and director of Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan , to help rewrite it . Meyer never read the earlier script , reasoning it pointless to do so since the content had no appeal to the studio . He and Bennett split the task of conceiving the plot between them . Bennett wrote the first quarter of the story , up to the point where the crew goes back in time . Meyer wrote the story 's middle portion , taking place on 20th @-@ century Earth , and Bennett handled the ending . After 12 days of writing , Meyer and Bennett combined their separate portions . In this version , Gillian Taylor stays on 1986 's Earth and vows to ensure the survival of the humpback whale despite the paradox it could create . Meyer preferred this " <unk> ending " to the film version , explaining " the end in the movie detracts from the importance of people in the present taking the responsibility for the ecology and preventing problems of the future by doing something today , rather than catering to the fantasy desires of being able to be transported in time to the near @-@ utopian future . " Meyer and Bennett cut out Krikes and Meerson 's idea of having the Klingon Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey fly over the Super Bowl and the hint that Saavik remained on Vulcan because she was pregnant with Spock 's child . 
 Nimoy said Meyer gave the script " the kind of humor and social comment , gadfly attitude I very much wanted " . He added that his vision was for " no dying , no fighting , no shooting , no photon torpedoes , no phaser blasts , no stereotypical bad guy . I wanted people to really have a great time watching this film [ and ] if somewhere in the mix we lobbed a couple of big ideas at them , well , then that would be even better . " One of Meyer 's earlier films , Time After Time , was largely based in San Francisco ; when he was told by the producers that The Voyage Home had to be set in the same city , he took the opportunity to comment upon cultural aspects not covered by his earlier film , such as punk rock — The Voyage Home 's scene where Kirk and Spock meet an annoying punk rocker was based on a similar scene cut from Time After Time . 
 Meyer found writing the script to be a smooth process . He would write a few pages , show it to Nimoy and Bennett for consultation , and return to his office to write some more . Once Nimoy , Bennett , and Meyer were happy , they showed the script to Shatner , who offered his own notes for another round of rewrites . The completed script was shown to Paramount executives , who were very pleased . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Industrial Light & Magic ( ILM ) was responsible for The Voyage Home 's model design and optical effects . The alien probe was the responsibility of ILM 's model shop , which brought in outside help like illustrator Ralph McQuarrie for concept art . The modelmakers started with art director Nilo Rodis ' basic design , a simple cylinder with <unk> qualities . The prototype was covered with barnacles and colored . The ball @-@ shaped antenna that juts out from the bottom of the probe was created out of a piece of irrigation pipe ; internal machinery turned the device . Three sizes of the " whale probe " were created ; the primary 8 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) probe model was supplemented by a smaller model for wide shots and a large 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) model that used forced perspective to give the probe the illusion of massive dimensions . 
 The effects crew focused on using in @-@ camera tricks to realize the probe ; post @-@ production effects were time @-@ consuming , so lighting effects were done on stage while filming . Model shop supervisor Jeff Mann filled the probe 's antenna with tube lamps and halogen bulbs that were turned on in sequence for different exposures ; three different camera passes for each exposure were combined for the final effect . After watching the first shot , the team found the original , <unk> probe design lacking in menace . The modelmakers repainted the probe a shiny black , pockmarked its surface for greater texture and interest , and re @-@ shot the scene . Although they wanted to avoid post @-@ production effects work , the opticals team had to <unk> the antenna ball in a blue hue , as the original orange looked too much like a spinning basketball . 
 Aside from the probe , The Voyage Home required no new starship designs . The USS Saratoga , the first Federation starship disabled by the probe , was the USS Reliant model from The Wrath of Khan . The Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey model from The Search for Spock was reused , but ILM built additional sturdy versions for The Voyage Home 's action sequences . The inside of the Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey was represented by a different set than The Search for Spock , but the designers made sure to adhere to a sharp and alien architectural aesthetic . To give the set a <unk> , atmospheric look , the designers rigged display and instrumentation lights to be bright enough that they could light the characters , rather than relying on ambient or rigged lighting . While Paramount had instructed ILM to trash the large Spacedock model created for The Search for Spock , the team had been loath to discard the complicated model and its miles of fiber optic lighting . When The Voyage Home called for the return of Spacedock , ILM had only to reassemble the model from storage . 
 Robert Fletcher served as costume designer for the film . During the Earth @-@ based scenes , Kirk and his crew continue to wear their 23rd @-@ century clothing . Nimoy debated whether the crew should change costumes , but after seeing how people in San Francisco are dressed , he decided they would still fit in . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Nimoy chose Donald Peterman , ASC , as director of photography . Nimoy said he regarded the cinematographer as a fellow artist , and that it was important for them to agree on " a certain look " that Peterman was committed to delivering . Nimoy had seen Peterman 's work and felt it was more nuanced than simply lighting a scene and capturing an image . 
 The film 's opening scenes aboard the starship Saratoga were the first to be shot ; principal photography commenced on February 24 , 1986 . The set was a redress of the science vessel Grissom 's bridge from The Search for Spock , in turn a redress of the Enterprise bridge created for The Motion Picture . The scenes were filmed first to allow time for the set to be revamped as the bridge of the new Enterprise @-@ A at the end of filming . 
 As with previous Star Trek films , existing props and footage were reused where possible to save money , though The Voyage Home required less of this than previous films . The Earth Spacedock interiors and control booth sets were reused from The Search for Spock , although the computer monitors in these scenes featured new graphics — the old reels had deteriorated in storage . Stock footage of the destruction of the Enterprise and the Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey 's movement through space were reused . While the Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey bridge was a completely new design , other parts of the craft 's interior were also redresses ; the computer room was a modification of the reactor room where Spock died in The Wrath of Khan . After all other Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey bridge scenes were completed , the entire set was painted white for one shot that transitioned into a dream sequence during the time travel . 
 The Voyage Home was the first Star Trek film to extensively film on location — only one day was spent doing so in The Search for Spock . Much of the production was filmed in and around San Francisco during ten days of shooting . The production wanted to film scenes that were readily identifiable as the city . The use of extensive location shooting caused logistical problems ; a scene in which Kirk is nearly run over by an irate cab driver required 12 – 15 cars to be repositioned if the shot was incorrect , taking a half @-@ hour to reshoot . Other scenes were filmed in the city but used sets rather than real locations , such as an Italian restaurant where Taylor and Kirk eat . In the film , the Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey lands cloaked in Golden Gate Park , surprising <unk> who flee the scene in their truck . The production had planned to film in the real park , where they had filmed scenes for The Wrath of Khan , but heavy rains before the day of shooting prevented it — the garbage truck would have become bogged down in the mud . Will Rogers Park in western Los Angeles was used instead . 
 When Kirk and Spock are traveling on a public bus , they encounter a punk rocker blaring his music on a boom box , to the discomfort of everyone around him . Spock takes matters into his own hands and performs a Vulcan nerve pinch . Part of the inspiration for the scene came from Nimoy 's personal experiences with a similar character on the streets of New York ; " [ I was struck ] by the arrogance of it , the aggressiveness of it , and I thought if I was Spock I 'd pinch his brains out ! " On learning about the scene , Kirk Thatcher , an associate producer on the film , convinced Nimoy to let him play the role ; Thatcher shaved his hair into a mohawk and bought clothes to complete the part . Credited as " punk on bus " , Thatcher ( along with sound designer Mark Mangini ) also wrote and recorded " I Hate You " , the song in the scene , and it was his idea to have the punk — rendered unconscious by the pinch — hit the stereo and turn it off with his face . 
 Much of the Cetacean Institute , Taylor 's workplace , was created by using the real @-@ life Monterey Bay Aquarium . A holding tank for the whales was added via special effects to the Aquarium 's exterior . For close @-@ ups of the characters as they watched the whales in the tank , the Aquarium 's walls and railings were measured and replicated for a set on the Paramount parking lot . One scene takes place by a large glass through which observers view the whales — and Spock 's initiation of a mind meld — underwater . Footage of the actors shot in front of them as they reacted to a brick wall in the Aquarium was combined with shots taken from their rear as they stood in front of a large blue screen at ILM to produce this scene . The footage of Spock 's melding with the whales was shot weeks later in a large water tank used to train astronauts for weightlessness . 
 In the film , Uhura and Chekov visit the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise . The real Enterprise , out at sea at the time , was unavailable for filming , so the non @-@ nuclear @-@ powered carrier USS Ranger ( CV @-@ 61 ) was used . Oakland International Airport was used for the foreground element of Starfleet Headquarters . Scenes in the San Francisco Bay were shot at a tank on Paramount 's backlot . 
 The scene in which Uhura and Chekov question passersby about the location of nuclear vessels was filmed with a hidden camera . However , the people with whom Koenig and Nichols speak were extras hired off the street for that day 's shooting and , despite legends to the contrary , knew they were being filmed . In an interview with StarTrek.com , Layla <unk> , the extra who said , " I don 't know if I know the answer to that ... I think it 's across the bay , in Alameda , " stated that after her car was impounded because she refused to move it for the filming , she approached the assistant director about appearing with the other extras , hoping to be paid enough to get her car out of impoundment . She was hired and told not to answer Koenig 's and Nichols ' questions . However , she answered them and the filmmakers kept her response in the film , though she had to be inducted into the Screen Actors Guild in order for her lines to be kept . 
 Vulcan and the Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey exterior was created with a combination of matte paintings and a soundstage . Nimoy had searched for a suitable location for the scene of the Enterprise crew 's preparations to return to Earth , but various locations did not work , so the scene was instead filmed on a Paramount backlot . The production had to mask the fact that production buildings were 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) away . A wide @-@ angle shot of Spock on the edge of a cliff overlooking the scene was filmed at Vasquez Rocks , a park north of Los Angeles . The Federation council chamber was a large set filled with representatives from many alien races . Production manager Jack T. Collis economized by building the set with only one end ; reverse angle shots used the same piece of wall . The positions of the Federation President 's podium and the actors on the seats were switched for each shot . Since The Voyage Home was the first Star Trek film to show the operations at Starfleet Command , Bennett and Nimoy visited NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to learn how a real deep space command center might look and operate . Among the resulting set 's features was a large central desk with video monitors that the production team nicknamed " the pool table " ; the prop later became a fixture in USS Enterprise @-@ D 's engine room on the television series Star Trek : The Next Generation .

 Nimoy approached ILM early in development and helped create storyboards for the optical effects sequences . Many shots used matte paintings to extend backgrounds and create establishing shots without the cost of building a set . Matte supervisor Chris Evans attempted to create paintings that felt less contrived and more real — while the natural instinct of filmmaking is to place important elements in an orderly fashion , Evans said that photographers would " shoot things that [ ... ] are odd in some way " and end up with results that look natural instead . The task of establishing the location and atmosphere at Starfleet Headquarters fell to the matte department , who had to make it feel like a bustling futuristic version of San Francisco . The matte personnel and Ralph McQuarrie provided design input . The designers decided to make actors in the foreground more prominent , and filmed them on a large area of smooth concrete runway at the Oakland Airport . Elements like a shuttlecraft that thirty extras appeared to interact with were also mattes blended to appear as if they were sitting by the actors . Ultimately the artists were not satisfied with how the shot turned out ; matte photography supervisor Craig Barron believed that there were too many elements in the scene . 
 The scenes of the Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey on Vulcan were combinations of live @-@ action footage — actors on a set in the Paramount parking lot that was covered with clay and used backdrops — and matte paintings for the ship itself and harsh background terrain . The scene of the ship 's departure from Vulcan for Earth was more difficult to accomplish ; the camera pans behind live @-@ action characters to follow the ship as it leaves the atmosphere , and other items like flaming pillars and a flaring sun had to be integrated into the shot . Rather than try to match and combine camera pans of each element , each component was shot with a static camera and the pan was added to the resulting composite by a motion control camera . The sun ( a light bulb focused by a convex lens ) was shot in different passes to create realistic light effects on the Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey without having the light bleed around other elements in the shot . 
 The script called for the probe to vaporize the Earth 's oceans , generating heavy cloud cover . While effects cinematographer Don Dow wanted to go to sea and record plumes of water created by exploding detonating cords in the water , the team decided to create the probe 's climatic effect in another way after a government fishing agency voiced concerns for the welfare of marine life in the area . The team used a combination of baking soda and cloud tank effects ; the swirling mist created by the water @-@ filled tank was shot on black velvet , and color and dynamic swirls were added by injecting paint into the tank . These shots were composited onto a painting of the Earth along with overlaid lightning effects , created by double @-@ exposing lights as they moved across the screen . 
 The Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey 's travel through time was one of the most difficult effects sequences of the film . While ILM was experienced in creating the streaking warp effect they used for previous films , the sequence required the camera to trail a sustained warp effect as the Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey rounded the sun . Matching the effect to the model was accomplished through trial @-@ and @-@ error guesswork . The team did not have the time to wait for the animation department to create the sun for this shot . Assistant cameraman Pete <unk> devised a way of creating the sun on @-@ stage . He placed two sheets of textured plexiglass next to each other and backlit them with a powerful yellow light . The rig was rotated on a circular track and the sheet in front created a <unk> pattern as its position shifted . Animator John Knoll added solar flare effects to complete the look ; Dow recalled that the effect came close to matching footage of the sun taken by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory . 
 Traveling through time , Kirk and crew experience what author Jody Duncan Shay termed a " dreamlike state " . The script 's only direction for the effect was " now [ they ] go through time " ; Nimoy and McQuarrie envisioned Kirk 's dream as a montage of bizarre images . The filmmakers decided early on that part of the dream sequence would use computer @-@ generated animation to give it an unreal quality divorced from the rest of the film . ILM worked from McQuarrie 's storyboards and created a rough mock @-@ up or animatic to show Nimoy and hone the direction of the sequence . For the very beginning of the dream , the inside of the Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey bridge was painted stark white . Part of the final sequence involved morphing the heads of the Enterprise crew into one another ; ILM digitized the cast members ' heads using a 3 @-@ D scanning technology developed by <unk> and used the resulting data for the computer models . Because each head model had the same number of key points of reference , transforming one character into another was simple ; more difficult , the animators recalled , was ensuring that the transformation looked " pleasing " and not " grotesque " . The resulting thirty seconds of footage took weeks to render ; the department used every spare computer they could find to help in the processing chores . ILM 's stage , optical , and matte departments collaborated to complete other shots for the dream sequence . The shot of a man 's fall to Earth was created by filming a small puppet on bluescreen . Shots of liquid nitrogen composited behind the puppet gave the impression of smoke . The background plate of the planet was a large matte that allowed the camera to zoom in very close . The final shot of marshy terrain was practical and required no effects . 
 The filmmakers knew from the beginning of production that the whales were their biggest effects concern ; Dow recalled that they were prepared to change to another animal in case creating the whales proved too difficult . When Humphrey the Whale wandered into the San Francisco Bay , Dow and his camera crew attempted to gather usable footage of the humpback but failed to do so . Other footage of real humpbacks either did not exist on 35 mm film or would have been difficult to match to specific actions required by the script . Compositing miniatures shot against bluescreen on top of water backgrounds would not have provided realistic play of light . Creating full @-@ size mechanical whales on tracks would severely limit the types of angles and shots . To solve the whale problem , Rodis hired robotics expert Walt Conti . While Conti was not experienced in film , Rodis believed his background in engineering and design made him well @-@ equipped for Rodis ' planned solution : the creation of independent and self @-@ contained miniature whale models . 
 After watching footage of whale movement , Conti determined that the models could be simplified by making the front of the whale entirely rigid , relying on the tail and fins for movement . Conti showed footage of the operation of a 30 @-@ inch ( 76 cm ) prototype to Paramount executives , who according to Conti , " loved it ... It really knocked them out . " With Paramount 's approval , ILM hired marine author , conservationist and illustrator Pieter <unk> to sculpt a realistic whale exterior . ILM decided on a finished model size of 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) — the size prevented delicate components like the tail from buckling under stress — and fitted it with mechanics and radio equipment required for control and operation . To prevent water from ruining the whale 's electronics , the modelmakers sealed every individual mechanical component rather than attempting to waterproof the entire whale . Balloons and lead weights were added to achieve the proper balance and buoyancy . The finished models were put in the swimming pool of Serra High School in San Mateo , California , for two weeks of shooting ; the operation of the whales required four handlers and divers with video cameras to help set up the shots . <unk> controlling the whales was difficult because of the murky water — ILM added diatomaceous earth to the water to match realistic ocean visibility . For a few shots , such as the whales ' breaching the water towards the end of the film , the creatures were represented by life @-@ size animatronics shot at Paramount . 
 Models of the starship USS Enterprise were destroyed in the previous film partly because visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston wanted to build a " more state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art ship for the next film " , but the filmmakers made the less costly decision to have the crew return to serve on the duplicate USS Enterprise A , and six weeks were spent repairing and repainting the old model . A travel pod from Star Trek : The Motion Picture was also reused for the ending , although the 20 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) interior set had to be rebuilt . Graphic designer Michael Okuda designed smooth controls with backlit displays for the Federation . Dubbed " <unk> " , the system was also used for displays on the Klingon ship , though the buttons were larger .

 James Horner , composer for The Wrath of Khan and The Search for Spock , declined to return for The Voyage Home . Nimoy turned to his friend Leonard Rosenman , who had written the music to Fantastic Voyage , Ralph Bakshi 's The Lord of the Rings , and two Planet of the Apes sequels . Rosenman wrote an arrangement of Alexander Courage 's Star Trek television theme as the title music for The Voyage Home , but Nimoy requested an original composition . Music critic Jeff Bond writes , " The final result was one of the most unusual Star Trek movie themes , " consisting of a six @-@ note theme and variations set against a repetitious four @-@ note brass motif ; the theme 's bridge borrows content from Rosenman 's " Frodo March " for The Lord of the Rings . The melody is played in the beginning of the film on Vulcan and the scenes of Taylor 's search for Kirk to help find her whales . 
 The Earth @-@ based setting of the filming gave Rosenman leeway to write a variety of music in different styles . Nimoy intended the crew 's introduction to the streets of San Francisco to be accompanied by something reminiscent of George Gershwin , but Rosenman changed the director 's mind , and the scene was scored with a contemporary jazz fusion piece by Yellowjackets . When Chekov flees detention aboard the aircraft carrier , Rosenman wrote a bright cue that incorporates classical Russian compositions . The music for the escape from the hospital was done in a baroque style . More familiar Rosenman compositions include the action music for the face off between the Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey and a whaling ship in open water , and the atmospheric music ( reminiscent of the composer 's work in Fantastic Voyage ) during the probe 's communication . After the probe leaves , a <unk> " whale fugue " begins . The first sighting of the Enterprise @-@ A uses the Alexander Courage theme before the end titles . 
 Mark Mangini served as The Voyage Home 's sound designer . He described it as different from working on many other films because Nimoy appreciated the role of sound effects and made sure that they were prominent in the film . Since many sounds familiar to Star Trek had been established — the Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey 's cloaking device , the transporter beam , et al . — Mangini focused on making only small changes to them . The most important sounds were those of the whales and the probe . Mangini 's brother lived near biologist Roger Payne , who had recordings of whale song . Mangini went through the tapes and chose sounds that could be mixed to suggest conversation and language . The probe 's screeching calls were the whale song in distorted form . The humpback 's communication with the probe at the climax of the film contained no dramatic music , meaning that Mangini 's sounds had to stand alone . He recalled that he had difficulty with envisioning how the scene would unfold , leading Bennett to perform a puppet show to explain . Nimoy and the other producers were unhappy with Mangini 's attempts to create the probe 's droning operating noise ; after more than a dozen attempts , the sound designer finally asked Nimoy what he thought the probe should sound like . Mangini recorded Nimoy 's guttural " wub @-@ wub @-@ wub " response , distorted it with " just the tiniest bit of dressing " , and used it as the final sound . 
 The punk music during the bus scene was written by Thatcher after he learned that the audio for the scene would be by " Duran Duran , or whoever " and not " raw " and authentic punk . Thatcher collaborated with Mangini and two sound editors who were in punk bands to create their own music . They decided that punk distilled down to the sentiment of " I hate you " , and wrote a song centered on the theme . Recording in the sound studio as originally planned produced too clean a sound , so they moved to the outside hallway and recorded the song in one take using cheap microphones to create a distorted sound . The song was also used in Paramount 's Back to the Beach .

 The Voyage Home opened theatrically in North America on Thanksgiving weekend , November 26 , 1986 . Since Star Trek had traditionally performed poorly internationally , the producers created a special trailer for foreign markets that de @-@ emphasized the Star Trek part of the title , as well as retelling the events of The Wrath of Khan and The Search for Spock . Winter recalled that the marketing did not seem to make a difference . The Voyage Home was the first Star Trek film shown in the Soviet Union , screened by the World Wildlife Fund on June 26 , 1987 , in Moscow to celebrate a ban on whaling . Attending the screening with Nimoy , Bennett was amazed the film proved as entertaining to the Russians as it did with American audiences ; he said " the single most rewarding moment of my Star Trek life " was when the Moscow audience applauded at McCoy 's line , " The bureaucratic mentality is the only constant in the universe . We 'll get a freighter . " Bennett believed it was a clear " messenger of what was to come " . 
 Vonda N. McIntyre wrote a novelization that was released at the same time as the film . It was the biggest tie @-@ in novel published by Pocket Books , and spent eight weeks on The New York Times bestseller list , peaking at # 3 . MCA Records released the film 's soundtrack November 26 , 1986 . 
 In its first week , The Voyage Home ended " Crocodile " Dundee 's 8 @-@ week reign of the American box office . The Star Trek film made $ 39 @.@ 6 million in its first five days of release , exceeding The Search for Spock 's opening by $ 14 million . Ultimately , the film grossed a global total of $ 133 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 against its $ 21 million cost ( $ 1 million under budget ) . In six weeks , The Voyage Home sold $ 81 @.@ 3 million in tickets , more than the franchise 's second or third film , and almost as much as Star Trek : The Motion Picture . The film was a major commercial success for Paramount , which released five of the top ten films of the year , and garnered 22 percent of all money taken in at American theaters . Much of the credit for Paramount 's success was given to chairman Frank Mancuso , Sr. , who moved The Voyage Home 's release from Christmas to Thanksgiving after research showed that the film might draw filmgoers away from The Golden Child . 
 Despite grossing $ 6 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 less than Star Trek : The Motion Picture , The Voyage Home was the most profitable of the series , grossing $ 133 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 against a $ 21 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 budget . 
 = = = Critical response = = = 
 The Voyage Home received mostly positive reviews — Nimoy called it the most well @-@ received of all Star Trek films made at that point — and it appealed to general audiences in addition to franchise fans . The movie was a " loose , jovial , immensely pleasurable Christmas entertainment " for The Washington Post 's Paul Attanasio , and a retrospective BBC review called the film " one of the series ' strongest episodes and proof that the franchise could weather the absence of space @-@ bound action and the iconic USS Enterprise , and still be highly enjoyable " . Although Janet Maslin of The New York Times admitted the film 's plot was " demented " , she wrote that the film " has done a great deal to ensure the series ' longevity " . Rushworth Kidder of the Christian Science Monitor praised the film for giving audiences a view of their modern life from a different perspective , while simultaneously proving that a film does not need to have murder , violence , innuendo or even a main villain for dramatic storytelling . 
 The film 's " fish out of water " comedy and acting were mostly lauded . The Courier Mail wrote that the film was funnier than its predecessors , and while not " flippant " , a sense of humor was revealed through the efforts of the cast , writers and director . Newsweek 's David Ansen considered The Voyage Home not only the most light @-@ hearted of the movie franchise , but the most true in spirit to the original television series . A more negative review was offered by Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail , who wrote that under Nimoy 's " choppy " direction there was a lack of comic timing paired with feeble humor . 
 The special effects were generally well @-@ received ; critics for The Sydney Morning Herald and Courier Mail noted that the effects played a lesser role in the film compared to the characters and dialogue . Similarly , USA Today felt the lack of special effects allowed the cast to " prove themselves more capable actors than ever before " . Maslin wrote that Nimoy 's technical direction left " much to be desired " ( pointing out a special effects scene where the Bird @-@ of @-@ Prey does not cast a shadow on the whaling ship as a mistake ) , but his " unmistakable " sincerity made up for these issues . 
 The Voyage Home garnered 11 nominations at the 14th annual Saturn Awards , tying Aliens for number of nominations . Nimoy and Shatner were nominated for best actor for their roles , and Catherine Hicks was nominated for best supporting actress . At the 59th Academy Awards , The Voyage Home was nominated for Best Cinematography , Sound ( Terry Porter , David J. Hudson , Mel Metcalfe and Gene Cantamessa ) , Sound Effects Editing , and Original Score .

 The Voyage Home was first released on VHS home media on September 30 , 1987 . Paramount Home Video spent $ 20 million marketing the film 's release alongside 10 episodes of the original series . The video sold hundreds of thousands of copies in the United States and Canadian markets , and was in the top ten rankings for sales and rentals in December and January 1988 . Paramount re @-@ released the film on March 12 , 1992 , with Fatal Attraction as part of a " Director 's Series " ; these editions had additional commentary and were presented in a widescreen letterbox format to preserve the film 's original cinematography . Nimoy was interviewed on the Paramount lots and discussed his acting career as well as his favorable opinion of the widescreen format . 
 A " bare bones " DVD of the film was released on November 9 , 1999 . Aside from the film , the contents include the original theatrical trailer and the introduction from the " Director 's Series " VHS release . Three and a half years later , a two disc " Collector 's Edition " was released with supplemental material and the same video transfer as the original DVD release . Among other special features , it contains a text commentary by Michael Okuda and an audio commentary from director Leonard Nimoy and star William Shatner . 
 The film was released on Blu @-@ ray Disc in May 2009 to coincide with the new Star Trek feature , along with the other five films that feature the original crew in Star Trek : Original Motion Picture Collection . The Voyage Home was remastered in 1080p high @-@ definition . Each film in the set has an additional soundtrack , enhanced to 7 @.@ 1 Dolby TrueHD standard .

 = Battle of Bizani = 
 The Battle of Bizani took place in Epirus on 4 – 6 March [ O.S. 19 – 21 February ] 1913 . The battle was fought between Greek and Ottoman forces during the last stages of the First Balkan War , and revolved around the forts of Bizani , which covered the approaches to Ioannina , the largest city in the region . 
 At the outbreak of the war , the Greek Army on the Epirus front did not have the numbers to initiate an offensive against the German @-@ designed defensive positions in Bizani . However , after the campaign in Macedonia was over , a large number of Greek troops were redeployed to Epirus , where Crown Prince Constantine himself assumed command . In the battle that followed the Ottoman positions were breached and Ioannina taken . Despite having a slight numerical advantage , this was not the decisive factor in the Greek victory . Rather , " solid operational planning " by the Greeks was key as it helped them implement a well @-@ coordinated and executed assault that did not allow the Ottoman forces time to react . 
 = = Background = = 
 As the main war effort of Greece was initially turned towards Macedonia , on the Epirus front the Greek army was outnumbered by the Ottoman <unk> Corps at the outbreak of hostilities in October 1912 . After stopping an initial attack by the Ottoman commander Esat Pasha at <unk> , however , the Greeks succeeded in liberating Preveza ( October 21 ) and pushing north in the direction of Ioannina , repulsing an Ottoman attack at <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) . On November 5 , a small force from Corfu made a landing and captured the coastal area of Himarë without facing significant resistance , and on December 20 Greek troops improved their positions in Epirus and entered Korçë , north of Ioannina , thus cutting off its last supply route and threatening the city 's northeastern flank . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 The terrain south of Ioannina provided excellent defensive ground . Moreover , the Ottoman forces further reinforced their positions with permanent fortifications , constructed under the direction of the German General Rüdiger von der Goltz . These were equipped with concrete artillery emplacements , bunkers , trenches , barbed wire , searchlights and machine gun positions . The Ioannina fortress area included two major fortresses , those of Bizani and Kastritsa , guarding the main southern approaches , along with five smaller forts in a ring around the city , covering the western and northwestern approaches . The forts were well supplied with artillery , totaling some 102 pieces ( most of them 87 mm ) . By December 1912 , both sides were reinforced : the Ottomans received part of the Vardar Army , retreating after the Battle of Monastir , bringing their forces up to some 35 @,@ 000 , while the Greeks also brought up the 2nd Division from Macedonia and a number of volunteer regiments , for a total of 25 @,@ 000 men . The Greeks launched a first attack on the fortress area on December 14 . The Ottomans succeeded in repelling it in a series of actions that lasted until December 22 , and even gained some ground , albeit at the cost of high casualties which depleted their numbers to some 26 @,@ 000 men . 
 With operations in Macedonia completed , the Greek High Command now turned its attention to Epirus . Three divisions were transferred to the theater , raising the total of Greek troops to ca . 40 @,@ 000 , along with 80 artillery pieces ( amongst which 12 heavy 105 mm and 155 mm guns ) and six aircraft . On the other hand , an additional number of Ottoman soldiers , who were retreating from the Macedonian front , reinforced the defenders . Throughout the period , the siege continued actively , with artillery duels , attacks by Albanian irregulars on Greek supply lines , and reconnaissance and bombing missions on the city by the Greek airplanes . At the same time , the hardships of the winter affected the morale of both sides . The Greek Epirus front commander , General Konstantinos <unk> , launched a new frontal attack on January 20 . Although it gained ground , pushing the defenders back into the fort of Bizani , the high casualty rate and the worsening weather resulted in the operation being suspended a few days later . 
 During the preparations , a mixed unit that included local women protected the left flank of the Greek Army , against a possible attack by Ottoman groups that were stationed in <unk> . Moreover , groups consisting of local females supported the Greek side in several ways , particularly in the transportation of guns , food , clothes , and other important supplies . On specific occasions women also participated in the armed conflicts against the Ottoman forces , some of them were distinguished in the battlefield , like Maria <unk> , who reached the rank of captain . 
 = = Battle = = 
 After the renewed failure , <unk> was relieved of his command and replaced by Crown Prince Constantine . Constantine now proceeded to carefully marshal his forces , bringing up more men and artillery . The Crown Prince formulated a new plan , whereby his army would feign an attack on Bizani from the southeast , while the main effort would be actually directed on the fortress area 's southwestern flank . 
 The Greek artillery began firing a preparatory bombardment on March 4 , continuing through the day . It is estimated that the Greeks fired 150 rounds per gun in this bombardment , while Ottoman counter @-@ fire was hampered by lack of ammunition . The assault was launched on 5 March [ O.S. 20 February ] 1913 , with three Greek infantry divisions — the 4th , 6th and 8th Infantry Divisions — thrusting against the eastern and western sectors of the defensive perimeter . At the same time the Metsovon Joint Brigade launched a diversionary attack from the north . The first Greek units , under heavy artillery support , breached the defensive line in <unk> sector at morning , and during the following hours the Ottoman defenses were broken in five locations . As a result , the defending Ottoman units from <unk> to <unk> retreated immediately to Ioannina in order to avoid encirclement . Moreover , as these breakthroughs from different axes threatened to collapse the entire defensive perimeter and to cut off his front echelons , Esat Pasha was forced to keep his reserve troops back and engage them in a defensive role . By 18h , the Greek 1st <unk> Regiment , together with the 9th Battalion commanded by Major Ioannis <unk> , entered the village of Agios Ioannis on the southern outskirts of Ioannina . 
 As a consequence of the Greek advance , the fortresses of Bizani and Kastritsa were cut off by 16h and isolated from the rest of the Ottoman army and its headquarters in Ioannina . As night fell , the forts ceased firing , and their garrisons abandoned them , trying to cut through the rather loose Greek encirclement to Ioannina . In their attempt to withdraw towards Ioannina , a significant number of Ottoman troops , totaling 35 officers and 935 soldiers , were captured by the Greek units positioned on the city 's southern outskirts . Several Ottoman positions capitulated the next morning , although Bizani and Kastritsa continued to resist until after the surrender . Meanwhile , Esat Pasha realized that the battle was lost , and tried to evacuate as many troops and wounded as he could to the north . As the Greeks pressed their advance however , he contacted the city 's foreign consulates to seek help in negotiating a surrender . At 23 : 00 on 6 March [ O.S. 21 February ] 1913 , he agreed upon the unconditional surrender of Ioannina and the Ottoman garrison to the Greeks . The following day the Greek forces under Crown Prince Constantine were parading through the flag @-@ covered streets of the city . On the other hand , Esat Pasha upon arriving in Turkey was welcomed as a national hero . 
 = = = Aerial warfare = = = 
 The Greek forces used a small fleet of six aircraft , which mainly consisted of Maurice Farman MF.7 biplanes , during the operations . They used an airfield near Nicopolis and performed several reconnaissance and bombing missions with considerable effect . Among the aviators were Dimitrios <unk> , Michael <unk> and Christos <unk> , who were flying above the Bizani and Ioannina sectors at a height of 1 @,@ 600 – 2 @,@ 300 meters ( 5 @,@ 200 – 7 @,@ 500 ft ) . On numerous occasions Ottoman troops , after recovering from their initial confusion , attempted to shoot down the aircraft with their rifles , with little success . Nevertheless , N. de <unk> , a Russian pilot flying for the Greeks , became the first pilot ever shot down in combat , when his biplane was hit by ground fire . He then came down near Preveza , repaired his plane and resumed flight back to his base . The day Ioannina came under Greek control , <unk> , also a native of the city , landed his aircraft on the city Town Hall square , to the adulation of an enthusiastic crowd . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 During the battle , the Greek army inflicted some 2 @,@ 800 Ottoman casualties , while suffering only 284 of its own . The Greeks captured some 8 @,@ 600 prisoners , while the remainder of the Ottoman garrison was able to retreat into Albania . The Greeks also captured 108 artillery pieces and large amounts of matériel . On 16 March [ O.S. 3 March ] 1913 the Greek forces entered Gjirokastër and Delvinë , and took Tepelenë the next day . At the end of the war they reached a line that stretched from the <unk> mountains ( above Himarë ) on the Ionian coast to Lake Prespa to the east . The success in the Epirus front enabled the Greek headquarters to transfer part of the army to Thessaloniki , in preparation for a confrontation against the Bulgarians . 
 Given the strongly entrenched opposition the Greek Army faced , historian Richard Hall cites the Battle of Bizani and the fall of Ioannina as Greece 's greatest military achievement in the First Balkan War . Numerical superiority was not a decisive factor for the Greeks during the final assault . Instead it was the way they planned their operations that led to a well coordinated and executed assault and left no opportunity for the Ottoman side to react in time . The surrender of Ioannina secured Greek control of southern Epirus and the Ionian coast . At the same time , it was denied to the newly formed Albanian state , for which it might have provided a southern anchor @-@ point comparable to Shkodër in the north ( see also Provisional Government of Albania ) . 
 = Linda Syddick Napaltjarri = 
 Linda <unk> Syddick Napaltjarri ( born c . 1937 ) is a <unk> and <unk> speaking Indigenous artist from Australia 's Western Desert region . Her father was killed when she was young ; her mother later married Shorty <unk> <unk> , an artist whose work was a significant influence on Linda Syddick 's painting . 
 Linda Syddick was one of many Western Desert women who took up painting in the early 1990s , as part of a broader contemporary Indigenous Australian art movement . She began painting some time prior to 1991 , when her work was first exhibited in Alice Springs . Her work includes a distinctive fusion of Christian and Aboriginal traditional themes and motifs . She has been a finalist in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards on at least four occasions , and in the Blake Prize ( a religious art competition ) at least three times . Her works are held by numerous galleries including the National Gallery of Australia , the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Art Gallery of South Australia . Linda Syddick was the subject of a portrait painted by Robert Hannaford , which was a 1992 finalist in Australia 's premiere portrait competition , the Archibald Prize . 
 = = Life = = 
 Sources differ on the year of Linda Syddick 's birth . The Art Gallery of South Australia suggests 1941 ; Birnberg and <unk> 's biographical survey suggests circa 1937 . The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians operate using a different conception of time , often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events . She was born near Western Australia 's <unk> , or Lake Mackay , northeast of <unk> Community , Western Australia and northwest of Kintore , Northern Territory . 
 'Napaljarri ' ( in Warlpiri ) or ' Napaltjarri ' ( in Western Desert dialects ) is a skin name , one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people . These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems . Although they may be used as terms of address , they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans . Thus ' Linda Syddick ' is the element of the artist 's name that is specifically hers . Linda has also been referred to as <unk> Napaltjarri , however she is not the artist Tjunkiya Napaltjarri , who lived at Papunya , Northern Territory . 
 Linda Syddick 's parents were <unk> or <unk> Nangala and <unk> Tjungurrayi ; however <unk> ( or <unk> ) was killed in a revenge attack when Linda was still very small , and in 1943 her mother moved to Kintore . Linda 's stepfather Shorty <unk> <unk> was a significant influence on her early painting . Short Lungkata was also the father of artist Wintjiya Morgan Napaltjarri ( known as Wintjiya No. 2 and no relation to yet another artist , Wintjiya Napaltjarri ) . Linda married Musty <unk> , had two children Ruby and Irene , and in the 1970s they were living in a Northern Territory Pintupi community called <unk> . After Musty 's death she remarried . 
 Linda Syddick has also achieved <unk> as a painter 's model : she was the subject of Robert Hannaford 's painting that was a finalist in the 2002 Archibald Prize , Australia 's premier portrait prize .

 Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began painting in 1971 , assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon . This initiative , which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures , rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia , particularly following the commencement of a government @-@ sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983 . By the 1980s and 1990s , such work was being exhibited internationally . The first artists , including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists ' company , had been men , and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia towards women painting . However , there was also a desire amongst many of the women to participate , and in the 1990s a large number of them began to create paintings . In the western desert communities such as Kintore , Yuendumu , Balgo , and on the outstations , people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale . 
 = = = Career = = = 
 Linda Syddick was painting by 1991 , when her works were hung in a private gallery — Gallery Gondwana — in Alice Springs . Her works , such as A nest of crosses , gladly borne painted for an exhibition titled Mary Mackillop : a tribute , combine traditional Indigenous painting techniques and motifs with Christian imagery and themes . Linda Syddick had two paintings included in an exhibition , From Appreciation to Appropriation , at the Flinders University Art Museum City Gallery in 2000 . One — Eucharist — again looked at Christian influences in Indigenous culture ; the other dealt with Hollywood influences , and was titled ET : the bicycle ride . Linda 's interest in Christian iconography is reflected in the inclusion of her work The Eucharist in another Flinders University Art Museum exhibition , Holy , Holy , Holy in 2004 , which examined the advent of Christianity in Australia . Other works represent her traditional country , such as her painting Tingari Men at <unk> ( Lake Mackay ) , which was a finalist at the 2009 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards . Artists of the Western Desert region , such as Linda Syddick , frequently portray figures from the Tingari cycle of ' songlines ' , particularly the Tingari Men . These are ancestral elders who − in the Dreaming − travelled over vast areas , performing rituals and creating the country . 
 In 1990 Linda Syddick went to Sydney to see her work <unk> Dreaming hung in the Blake Prize exhibition – one of three occasions prior to 1994 on which she was a Blake finalist . The Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art included one of her paintings in 1998 . She has been represented on several occasions in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards , in 1995 , 2006 ( with her painting The Witch Doctor and the Windmill ) , 2008 ( with Big rain at <unk> ) , and 2009 , with Tingari Men at <unk> ( Lake Mackay ) . Linda 's works are held in several major public collections , including the National Gallery of Australia , the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Art Gallery of South Australia .

 = HMS Fortune ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Fortune was one of nine F @-@ class destroyers built for the Royal Navy in the mid @-@ 1930s . Although she was assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion , the ship was detached to the Mediterranean Fleet to enforce the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides during the Spanish Civil War of 1936 – 39 . Several weeks after the start of the Second World War in September 1939 , Fortune helped to sink a German submarine . The ship escorted the larger ships of the fleet during the early stages of World War II and played a minor role in the Norwegian Campaign of 1940 . Fortune was sent to Gibraltar in mid @-@ 1940 and formed part of Force H where she participated in the attack on Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir . The ship escorted numerous convoys to Malta in 1940 – 41 until she was badly damaged by Italian bombers in mid @-@ 1941 . 
 After repairs were completed , Fortune was briefly assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she was transferred to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean in early 1942 . The ship screened an aircraft carrier during the Battle of Madagascar later that year and was assigned to convoy escort duties for the rest of 1942 and early 1943 . She returned home in February to begin conversion into an escort destroyer . The ship was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) when it was completed in mid @-@ 1943 and renamed HMCS Saskatchewan . The ship spent the next year escorting convoys in the North Atlantic before she was transferred to the English Channel to defend convoys during the Normandy landings in June 1944 . Sasketchewan engaged some German patrol boats the following month and was lightly damaged . She was sent to Canada for repairs and a general refit and did not return to the UK until January 1945 . The ship resumed her former duties until the end of the war in May and then ferried troops back to Canada for several months . Sasketchewan was judged surplus later that year and was sold for scrap , in early 1946 .
