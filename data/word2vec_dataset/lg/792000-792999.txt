 = 1979 Coyote Lake earthquake = 
 The 1979 Coyote Lake earthquake occurred at 10 : 05 : 24 local time on August 6 with a moment magnitude of 5 @.@ 7 and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of VII ( Very strong ) . The shock occurred on the Calaveras Fault near Coyote Lake in Santa Clara County , California and resulted in a number of injuries , including some that required hospitalization . Most of the $ 500 @,@ 000 in damage that was caused was non @-@ structural , but several businesses were closed for repairs . Data from numerous strong motion instruments was used to determine the type , depth , and extent of slip . A mild aftershock sequence lasted throughout the remainder of the month that was of interest to seismologists , especially with regard to fault creep , and following the event , local governments evaluated their response to the incident . 
 = = Tectonic setting = = 
 Several strands of the San Andreas Fault System in the eastern region of the San Francisco Bay Area are the Hayward – Rodgers Creek and Calaveras Faults . The Hayward Fault exhibits fault creep , but it also has potential for large earthquakes , like the 1868 M7 Hayward earthquake that occurred on its southern segment . The northern Calaveras Fault meets the Hayward Fault near the Calaveras Reservoir and can also produce large earthquakes . Except for a ~ M6.5 shock that occurred in 1911 , the central and southern segments might only produce smaller events and fault creep . 
 = = Earthquake = = 
 The earthquake originated ( without foreshocks ) on the Calaveras Fault near Coyote Lake in Santa Clara County . It was felt up to 120 mi ( 200 km ) away ( from Santa Rosa in the north to San Luis Obispo in the south ) and made some high @-@ rise buildings sway in Reno , Nevada , but damage was mainly limited to the nearby towns of Gilroy and Hollister . The earlier M7 Hayward earthquake occurred about 31 mi ( 50 km ) to the north and the 1911 shock was located near Mount Hamilton . 
 About fifty strong motion stations recorded the event , including an array of units along the rupture zone , and instruments at the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory ( about 62 mi ( 100 km ) away ) . The records revealed that strike @-@ slip motion occurred over 8 @.@ 7 mi ( 14 km ) on a vertical fault , and that the total amount of slip varied with depth , with more slip occurring in the shallower regions . The two closest stations at Coyote Creek and Gilroy , as well as the Berkeley stations , were used to refine the overall fault length , slip , and depth of faulting . 
 = = = Strong motion = = = 
 The event was captured on seismographs at distances of up to 71 miles ( 114 km ) , including Richmond , with the unit 56 ft ( 17 m ) " down hole " in bay mud . Other underground instruments on the BART Transbay Tube , as well as the Richmond site , showed accelerations that were very low . In San Juan Bautista , the U.S. Route 101 / State Route 156 overpass saw peak acceleration of <unk> on the ground ( with <unk> on the structure ) . Instruments on the gymnasium roof diaphragm at the campus of West Valley College in Saratoga provided records of interest . Of a number of dams that had instruments installed , the San Luis Dam at San Luis Reservoir had the strongest response . The highest acceleration of <unk> was seen at the Gilroy Array within the fault zone . 
 = = = Damage = = = 
 In Gilroy and Hollister , sixteen people were injured , and damage totaled $ 500 @,@ 000 . Chimneys fell ( especially on older homes in the downtown area of Gilroy ) and glass was broken , but in Gilroy structural damage afflicted five buildings . A wall was cracked at city hall , and a court room ceiling collapsed . Damaged structural components at a Ford 's Department Store forced its closure . In Hollister , a J. C. Penney had a hole and cracks in its ceiling and a parapet collapsed at a law office . At Casa de Fruta , a service station sustained structural damage , as did a fire station at Pacheco Pass . 
 An early estimate by the Small Business Administration put total damage in Gilroy at twice the amount of what was seen in Hollister . Ten victims were brought to Hazel Hawkins Memorial Hospital in Hollister for treatment of lacerations , a cardiac problem , and anxiety . In Gilroy , the Wheeler Hospital saw six similar cases and a patient with a fractured hip . Most of those that sought care ( including four that were transported by ambulance ) were treated and released , but six were admitted . 
 = = = Aftershocks = = = 
 The United States Geological Survey operated a network of seismograph stations in the region where the shock occurred since 1969 . A survey of the aftershock activity used data from these stations , along with a custom crustal velocity model , to narrow epicenter locations to within several tens of meters . The study indicated that the mainshock and the aftershocks were aligned with the strike and dip of the Calaveras Fault in that area and were classified into three distinct groups . The east @-@ dipping northeastern group , a diffuse middle group , and a shallow and nearly vertical southwestern group showed variations of slip , especially in the 18 months after the mainshock , when fault creep was significantly higher in the northeastern and middle groups . 
 = = Response = = 
 While none of the affected counties or cities declared a state of emergency following the event , the Small Business Administration did approve a request by the Office of Emergency Services for a disaster declaration in late September . This formality paved the way for low interest loans for commercial or residential properties that suffered damage , but only about 50 claims were expected . Local authorities had trained for disasters on a regular basis , and the response to the light damage was considered smooth , though some officials sought room for improvement . Discussions followed the event , with local governments focusing on telecommunication problems , emergency power systems , and seismic safety . 
 = Italian cruiser Varese = 
 Varese was a Giuseppe Garibaldi @-@ class armored cruiser built for the Royal Italian Navy ( Regia Marina ) in the 1890s . The ship made several deployments to the Eastern Mediterranean and the Levant before the start of the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 . She supported ground forces in the occupations of Tripoli and Homs in Libya . Varese may have bombarded Beirut and did bombard the defenses of the Dardanelles during the war . She also provided naval gunfire support for the Italian Army in Libya . During World War I , the ship 's activities were limited by the threat of Austro @-@ Hungarian submarines and Varese became a training ship in 1920 . She was struck from the naval register in 1923 and subsequently scrapped . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Varese had an overall length of 111 @.@ 8 meters ( 366 ft 10 in ) , a beam of 18 @.@ 2 meters ( 59 ft 9 in ) and a deep draft ( ship ) of 7 @.@ 3 meters ( 23 ft 11 in ) . She displaced 7 @,@ 350 metric tons ( 7 @,@ 230 long tons ) at normal load . The ship was powered by two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one shaft , using steam from 24 coal @-@ fired Belleville boilers . The engines were rated 13 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 100 kW ) and designed to give a speed of approximately 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . During her sea trials on 27 November 1900 , Varese barely exceeded her designed speed , reaching 20 @.@ 02 knots from 14 @,@ 200 ihp ( 10 @,@ 600 kW ) . She had a cruising range of 5 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 200 km ; 6 @,@ 300 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Her complement ordinarily consisted of 555 officers and enlisted men and 578 when acting as a flagship . 
 Her main armament consisted of one 254 @-@ millimeter ( 10 in ) gun in a turret forward of the superstructure and two 203 @-@ millimeter ( 8 in ) guns in a twin turret aft . Ten of the 152 @-@ millimeter ( 6 in ) guns that comprised her secondary armament were arranged in casemates amidships ; the remaining four 152 @-@ millimeter guns were mounted on the upper deck . Varese also had ten 76 @-@ millimeter ( 3 in ) and six 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) guns to defend herself against torpedo boats . She was fitted with four single 450 @-@ millimeter ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . 
 The ship 's waterline armor belt had a maximum thickness of 150 millimeters ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) amidships and tapered to 80 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) towards the ends of the ship . The conning tower , casemates , and gun turrets were also protected by 150 @-@ millimeter armor . Her protective deck armor was 37 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) thick and the 152 @-@ millimeter guns on the upper deck were protected by gun shields 50 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . 
 = = Construction and service = = 
 Varese , named after the Battle of Varese during the Second Italian War of Independence , was laid down by Orlando at their shipyard in Livorno on 24 January 1898 , launched on 6 August 1899 and completed on 5 April 1901 . The ship made port visits to Algiers on 14 September 1903 and Barcelona on 4 April 1904 . During the 1905 fleet maneuvers , she was assigned to the " hostile " force blockading La Maddalena , Sardinia . Varese was present in Athens during the Intercalated Olympic Games in April 1906 . Together with her sister ships Francesco Ferruccio and Giuseppe Garibaldi , the ship was in Marseilles , France on 15 – 16 September 1906 to participate in a fleet review for Armand Fallières , President of France , on the latter date . Under the command of Prince Luigi Amedeo , Duke of the Abruzzi , Varese was present at the Jamestown Exposition in May 1907 . The ship was assigned to the Levant from 1 October 1909 to 20 February 1910 and then based at Suda Bay , Crete from 23 August to 20 September 1911 . 
 When the Italo @-@ Turkish War began on 29 September 1911 , Varese assigned to the 4th Division of the 2nd Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet , together with her sisters Giuseppe Garibaldi and Francesco Ferruccio . While her sisters bombarded Tripoli on 3 – 4 October , Varese appears to have been deployed seaward to provide security for the Italians . On 13 October , the three sisters sailed to Augusta , Sicily to recoal . The ship escorted two troop transports and a hospital ship on her return voyage several days later . On 16 October , she escorted a troop convoy to Homs and bombarded the town after the Ottoman commander refused to surrender . Bad weather prevented any landings until 21 October and the ship continued to provide fire support for the Italian troops . 
 Varese and Giuseppe Garibaldi were in Tobruk in January 1912 while the bulk of the fleet was refitting in Italy . Varese is sometimes credited with participating in the bombardment of Beirut on 24 February 1912 , but it seems most probable that this was done by her sisters Francesco Ferruccio and Giuseppe Garibaldi . On 18 April Varese and Giuseppe Garibaldi bombarded the fortifications at the entrance to the Dardanelles , heavily damaging them . After returning to Italy later that month , Varese began a refit that included replacing her worn @-@ out guns and lasted through mid @-@ June . 
 When Italy declared war on the Central Powers in May 1915 , the ship was assigned to the 5th Cruiser Division , based at Brindisi . On 5 June the division bombarded rail lines near Ragusa and departed Brindisi on the evening of 17 July to do the same near Ragusa Vecchia the following morning . Shortly after beginning the bombardment at 04 : 00 , Giuseppe Garibaldi was torpedoed by the Austro @-@ Hungarian submarine U @-@ 4 ; one torpedo passed between Varese and Giuseppe Garibaldi . Struck by a single torpedo , the cruiser sank within minutes , although only 53 crewmen were killed . The division immediately retreated to avoid further attacks , leaving three destroyers behind to rescue survivors . The loss of Giuseppe Garibaldi and the sinking of the armored cruiser Amalfi by another submarine on 7 July severely restricted the activities of the other ships based at Venice . 
 On 15 May 1917 , as the Austro @-@ Hungarian Fleet was preparing to attack the Otranto Barrage that blocked the exit from the Adriatic Sea , Varese was at the port of <unk> on the north coast of Corfu . She did not , however , sortie in response to the Austro @-@ Hungarian movements . She became a cadet training ship from 1920 to 1922 . She was stricken on 4 January 1923 and scrapped . 
 = Eastern green mamba = 
 The eastern green mamba ( Dendroaspis angusticeps ) , also known as the common mamba , East African green mamba , green mamba , or white @-@ mouthed mamba , is a large and highly venomous tree @-@ dwelling snake species of the mamba genus Dendroaspis . This species of mamba was first described by a Scottish surgeon and zoologist in 1849 . This snake mostly inhabits the coastal regions of southern East Africa . It is a relatively large species of venomous snake , with adult females averaging approximately 2 @.@ 0 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) in total length , while males are slightly smaller on average . Eastern green mambas prey on adult birds , eggs , bats , and terrestrial rodents such as mice , rats , and gerbils . They are shy and elusive snakes which are rarely seen , making them somewhat unusual among mambas , and elapids in general . This elusiveness is usually attributed to the species ' green colouration which blends with its environment , and its arboreal lifestyle . However , eastern green mambas have also been observed to use " sit @-@ and @-@ wait " or ambush predation like many vipers , unlike the active foraging style typical of other elapids , which may be a factor in the rarity of sightings . 
 Like other species of mamba , the eastern green mamba is a highly venomous species ; a single bite can contain enough venom to kill several humans . The venom acts on the nerves , heart , and muscles , and spreads quickly through tissue . Bites rapidly progress to life @-@ threatening symptoms characteristic of mamba bites , which include swelling of the bite area , dizziness , nausea , difficulty breathing and swallowing , irregular heartbeat , convulsions , and eventual respiratory paralysis . A neurotoxin common to all species within the genus Dendroaspis is the most rapid @-@ acting snake venom toxin known , so although this species is not aggressive and is not a major cause of snakebite incidents in Africa , the mortality rate associated with eastern green mamba bites is rather high . Bites that produce severe envenomation can be rapidly fatal . Case reports of death in as little as 30 minutes have been recorded for this species . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The eastern green mamba is classified under the genus Dendroaspis of the family Elapidae . Dendroaspis angusticeps was first described by a Scottish surgeon and zoologist , Dr. Andrew Smith in 1849 . The generic name , Dendroaspis , is derived from Ancient Greek – <unk> , which means " tree " , and aspis ( ασπίς ) or " asp " , which is understood to mean " shield " , but it also denotes " cobra " or simply " snake " . In old texts , aspis or asp was used to refer to Naja haje ( in reference to the hood , like a shield ) . Thus , " Dendroaspis " literally means tree snake , which refers to the arboreal nature of most of the species within the genus . The specific name angusticeps is derived from the Latin word angustus , which means " narrow " and -ceps is also Latin and is derived from the word " <unk> " which means " head " or " of or relating to the head " , calling attention to the long narrow head of this species . In addition to being called the eastern green mamba , this species is also commonly known as the common green mamba , East African green mamba , white @-@ mouthed mamba , or just simply the green mamba . 
 The genus was first described by the German ornithologist and herpetologist Hermann Schlegel in 1848 . Slowinski et al . ( 1997 ) pointed out that the relationships of the African genus Dendroaspis are problematical . However , evidence suggests that Dendroaspis , Ophiophagus , Bungarus , and <unk> form a solid non @-@ coral snake Afro @-@ Asiatic clade . 
 = = Description = = 
 The eastern green mamba is a large , with a slightly compressed , and very slender bodied snake with a medium to moderately long tapering tail . Adult males average around 1 @.@ 8 metres ( 5 @.@ 9 ft ) in total length , while females average 2 @.@ 0 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) in total length . This species rarely exceeds lengths of 2 @.@ 5 metres ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) . In general , the total length is 4 @-@ 4 @.@ 3 times the length of the tail . The head is narrow , elongate , and coffin @-@ shaped with a distinct canthus and slightly distinct from the neck . When threatened or otherwise aroused in someway , this species is capable of flattening its neck area , though no real hood formed . The eastern green mamba has relatively long front fangs located at proscenium end of the maxillary bone at the very front of the maxilla , which can rotate at its axis with the prefrontal bone , giving this species more control of the movements of their fangs , unlike other elapids . The maxillary bone has no other solid teeth . However , a pair of long , recurved , fang @-@ like solid teeth , followed behind by a distinct <unk> and numerous small teeth are on the front of the lower jaw . Their eyes are medium in size with round pupils . 
 = = = Scalation = = = 
 Dorsal scales are oblique , smooth and narrow . Coloration in this species is bright green dorsally and yellow @-@ green ventrally , with a few bright yellow scales scattered on the flanks in some specimens . Juveniles are blue @-@ green , and develop the brighter green adult coloration anteriorly to posteriorly in successive <unk> of the skin . Most individuals over 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) in total length have the full adult coloration , but even some adults may return to a darker bluish green just before shedding . The border of the pupil may have a narrow bright ochre to golden yellow edge , and the posterior border of the iris may become bright green . The inside of the mouth may be white or bluish white . The males of this species usually have fewer ventral scales than the females . 
 The head , body , and tail scalation of the eastern green mamba : 
 = = Reproduction = = 
 The eastern green mamba is solitary , except during breeding season , when they are most active and males engage in combat and males and females mate . <unk> females tend to be sedentary , but males will actively search out and court females during the long rainy season , which is between the months of April and June . Males have been observed engaging in agonistic behaviour and may fight each other over potential mating opportunities , or possibly to establish a dominance hierarchy . Typically , a male initiates a fight by moving on top of the other ’ s body and tongue @-@ flicking , after which the two snakes “ intertwine their necks and bodies , and push against each other ” in an attempt to pin each other 's head repeatedly to the ground . Male @-@ male combat can last for several hours , but combat between males of this species don 't ever include biting and the nature of the combat is never as aggressive and / or vicious as commonly seen among the eastern green mamba 's much larger cousin , the black mamba . Males locate females by following a scent trail . The male courts the female by aligning his body along the female ’ s while rapidly tongue @-@ flicking . Depending on whether the female is receptive to mating , she will lift her tail and cloacal juxtaposition will follow shortly . Courtship and mating take place in the trees , after which the female lays anywhere between 4 @-@ 17 eggs ( average of 10 to 15 eggs are laid ) , which occurs in the summer months of October and November . The eggs are white and elongated , usually measuring <unk> millimetres . The eggs are usually laid in a hollow tree , among decaying vegetation , or leaf litter . The incubation period is 10 to 12 weeks . When the young emerge from the eggs , they are approximately 30 to 40 centimetres ( 12 to 16 in ) or around an average of 44 centimetres ( 17 in ) in length , and they 're highly venomous right at birth . Individuals of this species usually reach adult coloration at a length of 60 to 75 centimetres ( 24 to 30 in ) Hatchlings tend to grow 50 to 80 centimetres ( 20 to 31 in ) in length in the first year of life . As the hatchlings age , their growth rates decrease but they never stop completely growing . 
 = = = Lifespan = = = 
 The longest living eastern green mamba was a captive specimen which lived for 18 @.@ 8 years . Another captive specimen lived for 14 years . However , while it may be possible for wild specimens to live that long , they are thought to have shorter lifespans in general due to the threats of predation , habitat loss , disease , and other biological and environmental factors . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 This species is indigenous to more coastal regions of southern Africa and east Africa . The eastern green mamba 's range extends from Kenya south through Tanzania , Mozambique , Malawi , eastern Zimbabwe , eastern Zambia into South Africa as far as southern Natal and northern <unk> . It can also be found in Zanzibar . The distribution of this species is assumed to be continuous , but reports seem to be scarce in regions within the species ' range . 
 The eastern green mamba is primarily arboreal ( living in trees ) , only rarely descending to the ground . An elusive snake due to its coloration , it is usually well camouflaged in trees or bushes . It is believed by some herpetologists that this species is limited to tropical rainforests in coastal lowlands , however , according to other experts , this species can also be found in coastal bush , and dune and montane forest . Unlike its close relative the black mamba ( D. polylepis ) , this species is rarely found in open terrain and prefers relatively dense , well @-@ shaded vegetation . In addition to wild forest habitats , this species is also commonly found in thickets and farm trees ( such as citrus , mango , coconut , and cashew ) . In coastal east Africa they are known to enter houses and may even shelter in thatched roof dwellings . Specimens of this species have been found at elevations up to 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) above sea level . 
 = = = Conservation status = = = 
 As of June 26 , 2011 , the conservation status of Dendroaspis angusticeps has not been assessed by the IUCN . The eastern green mamba is , however , a fairly common species of snake throughout its geographical range , and populations are believed to be stable . Large concentrations of two to three individuals per hectare have been documented in coastal Kenya and southern Tanzania , and in one instance a group of five eastern green mambas were seen in a single tree . Although populations of this species are stable , habitat destruction and deforestation may pose a possible threat to this species . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 The eastern green mamba is a diurnal , arboreal , and secretive species of snake , and it tends to spend most of its time above the ground in relatively dense brush , where it is well camouflaged . This species is not commonly found on land unless motivated by thirst , prey , or the need to bask in the sun ( thermoregulation ) . It is an alert , nervous , excellent climber and extremely agile snake . It sleeps at night in a tree coiled up in leafy clumps rather than seeking a tree hollow ( although sometimes found in them ) . In a study of the movement patterns of two adult specimens of this species over a 27 @-@ day period , the researcher found that their activity range areas to be very low , comparable to other predators who ambush prey rather than actively hunt them . This is in contrast to most elapid species , including other mambas , who tend to actively hunt or forage for prey . The study 's preliminary evidence sheds some light on this species ' method of hunting prey and suggests that it may be an ambush predator due to the sit @-@ and @-@ wait behavior displayed . However , this evidence does not preclude active foraging by this species . A specimen systematically hunting a sleeping bat was observed by William York . There is no evidence that the eastern green mamba migrates ; in fact , this species is thought to be relatively sedentary . It can remain in the same location for days at a time , apparently moving most commonly to find food or mates . On average , individuals of this species move only about 5 @.@ 4 metres ( 18 ft ) per day . Unlike its much larger cousin the black mamba , this mamba is more shy and not as aggressive or fearsome . It will avoid confrontation with humans or any other potential predators when possible , and will rather rely on its camouflage , or flee , than alert a potential threat of its presence . They are fast snakes , capable of moving 7 mph . They don 't always strike , but under continuous harassment and provocation and especially if cornered , they may suddenly strike repeatedly in quick succession , often leading to severe envenomation . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 This mamba preys primarily on adult birds , eggs and rodents . This species has also been documented to prey on bats . It is also believed that this species eats arboreal lizards as well , but this has not been documented . The preliminary evidence suggests that this species displays a sit @-@ and @-@ wait strategy of foraging . However , this evidence does not preclude active foraging by this species . One witness observed a specimen systematically hunt sleeping bats ( J. Ashe , <unk> comm . 1991 ) . They have also been known to raid the nests of young birds . Sit @-@ and @-@ wait tactics may be successful with highly mobile prey , such as adult birds or rodents . Documented prey include the sombre <unk> , which occur in dense portions of natural and cultivated vegetation along Kenya 's coastline . Ionides and Pitman ( 1965 ) reported a large Bushveld gerbil in the stomach of a green mamba in Tanzania . Although the Bushveld gerbil does not occur in Kenya , green mambas will prey on any of the seven species of gerbil that inhabit various portions of its range . 
 = = = Predators = = = 
 The eastern green mamba has a few natural predators . Humans , mongooses , snake eagles , and genets commonly prey on this species of mamba . <unk> and other snakes tend to prey on juvenile green mambas . 
 = = Venom = = 
 The eastern green mamba is an especially venomous snake . The venom consists of both pre @-@ synaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins ( <unk> ) , cardiotoxins , <unk> , and fasciculins . The average venom yield per bite is 80 mg according to Engelmann and Obst ( 1981 ) , while Minton ( 1974 ) gives it a range of 60 – 95 mg ( dry weight ) . The subcutaneous LD50 is 1 @.@ 3 mg / kg . The LD50 in mice through the IV route is 0 @.@ 45 mg / kg . Like all other mamba species , the toxicity of individual specimens within the same species can vary greatly based on several factors including geographical region , age , seasonal variation , diet , and so on . Local swelling is variable and sometimes absent after mamba bites . However , patients bitten by the eastern green mamba develop swelling of the entire bitten limb and also show mild <unk> disturbances ( <unk> DA ; MacKay et al . 1966 ) . The rare cases of local tissue damage usually resulted from bites on the fingers or the use of a tight tourniquet . This species has caused bites to humans and many of the bites attributed to this species have often resulted in fatalities . The mortality rate of untreated bites is unknown but is thought to be quite high . Symptoms of envenomation by this species include swelling of the bite site , dizziness , and nausea , accompanied by difficulty breathing and swallowing , irregular heartbeat , convulsions , rapid progression to respiratory paralysis . Bites that produce severe envenomation can be rapidly fatal . Case reports of rapidly fatal outcomes , in as little as 30 minutes , have been recorded for this species . 
 = Shrine of Remembrance = 
 The Shrine of Remembrance , located in Kings Domain on St Kilda Road , Melbourne , Australia was built as a memorial to the men and women of Victoria who served in World War I and is now a memorial to all Australians who have served in war . It is a site of annual observances of ANZAC Day ( 25 April ) and Remembrance Day ( 11 November ) and is one of the largest war memorials in Australia . 
 Designed by architects Phillip Hudson and James Wardrop who were both World War I veterans , the Shrine is in a classical style , being based on the Tomb of Mausolus at Halicarnassus and the Parthenon in Athens . The crowning element at the top of the memorial 's ziggurat roof references the <unk> Monument of <unk> . Built from Tynong granite , the Shrine originally consisted only of the central sanctuary surrounded by the ambulatory . The sanctuary contains the marble Stone of Remembrance , upon which is engraved the words " Greater love hath no man " . Once a year , on 11 November at 11 a.m. ( Remembrance Day ) , a ray of sunlight shines through an aperture in the roof to light up the word " Love " in the inscription . Beneath the sanctuary lies the crypt , which contains a bronze statue of a soldier father and son , and panels listing every unit of the Australian Imperial Force . 
 The Shrine went through a prolonged process of development which began in 1918 with the initial proposal to build a Victorian memorial . Two committees were formed , the second of which ran a competition for the memorial 's design . The winner was announced in 1922 . However , opposition to the proposal ( led by Keith Murdoch and The Herald ) forced the governments of the day to rethink the design , and a number of alternatives were proposed , the most significant of which was the ANZAC Square and cenotaph proposal of 1926 . In response , General Sir John Monash used the 1927 ANZAC Day march to garner support for the Shrine , and finally won the support of the Victorian government later that year . The foundation stone was laid on 11 November 1927 , and the Shrine was officially dedicated on 11 November 1934 .

 = = = Conception : 1918 – 1922 = = = 
 A war memorial in Melbourne was proposed as soon as the war ended in November 1918 . In the early 1920s the Victorian state government appointed the War Memorials Advisory Committee , chaired by Sir Baldwin Spencer , which recommended an " arch of victory " over St Kilda Road , the major boulevard leading out of the city of Melbourne to the south . In August 1921 an executive committee was formed , with the former commander of the Australian forces in the war , General Sir John Monash , as its driving force . The committee soon abandoned the idea of an arch and proposed a large monumental memorial to the east of St Kilda Road , a position which would make it clearly visible from the centre of the city . A competition was launched in March 1922 to find a design for the new memorial , open both to British subjects residing in Australia and any Australian citizens who were residing overseas . A total of 83 entries were submitted , and in December 1923 the design offered by two Melbourne architects ( and war veterans ) , Phillip Hudson and James Wardrop , was announced as the winner .

 The winning design had a number of supporters , including publications such as The Age and George Taylor 's Sydney @-@ based trade journal , Building , prominent citizens including artist Norman Lindsay and University of Sydney Dean of Architecture , Leslie Wilkinson , and the Royal Australian Institute of Architects ( who had been heavily involved in the competition ) . Nevertheless , the design was also fiercely criticised in some quarters — especially by Keith Murdoch 's Herald , Murdoch reportedly describing the Shrine as " too severe , stiff and heavy , that there is no grace or beauty about it and that it is a tomb of gloom " — on the grounds of its grandiosity , its severity of design and its expense . As part of the campaign against the Shrine proposal , the Herald searched for alternative concepts , arguing that the funds could be better spent on more practical projects such as a hospital or a war widow 's home . Furthermore , some Christian churches also attacked the design as pagan for having no cross or other Christian element . 
 The new Victorian Labor government of 1924 , under George Prendergast , supported the Herald 's view , and pushed for a memorial hospital instead of the Shrine . When the Labor government was replaced with John Allan 's Country / National coalition , the plan changed once again , leaning towards the earlier suggestion of an arch of victory to be built over St. Kilda Road . As a result of the debate , significant delays postponed the construction of the new memorial , so a temporary wood @-@ and @-@ plaster cenotaph was raised for the 1926 ANZAC day march . The success of the temporary cenotaph led the Victorian government to abandon the earlier project in 1926 , and propose instead to build a permanent cenotaph in a large " ANZAC Square " at the top of Bourke St in front of Parliament House . While this would have involved demolishing the Windsor Hotel , one of Melbourne 's favourite hotels , the new plan won the support of the Herald , the Returned Soldiers League ( RSL ) and the Melbourne City Council . 
 Nevertheless , both Monash and Legacy still supported the Shrine . After a vote in favour of the Shrine by their executive council , Legacy started a public relations campaign , gaining the support of much of the media — although the council , state government and the Herald continued to oppose . In 1927 , with the then Duke of York , Prince Albert , visiting the country , Monash spoke on the eve of ANZAC day at the RSL dinner , arguing for the Shrine . The audience had been seeded with supporters , who provided a standing ovation at the conclusion of his speech , which helped to produce a groundswell of support . When a vote was called for , the majority voted in favour of the Shrine proposal . The next day , with Monash leading 30 @,@ 000 veterans in the 1927 ANZAC Day march , and with the new support of the RSL , The Age , and the Argus , the Shrine proposal had gained " new momentum " . Faced with such support , and with Monash 's arguments that the ANZAC Square would be prohibitively expensive , Edmond Hogan 's new Labor government decided in favour of the Shrine . 
 Another early point of contention ( although not explicitly related to the nature of the memorial ) concerned the possibility of incorporating a " Tomb of the Unknown Soldier " into the memorial — an approach that was championed by the St. Kilda RSL , who revealed plans to bury a soldier from either Gallipoli or France on ANZAC day , 25 April 1922 . This proposal received considerable debate , and was countered by the argument that the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey represented all of the dead of the British Empire . Monash was on the side of those against such a burial , as while he could see a place for an Unknown Soldier in a national memorial , he did not feel that it would be suitable at the Victorian Shrine . The Stone of Remembrance was later placed in the position where an Unknown Soldier might have been laid . An Australian Unknown Soldier was eventually interred at the Australian War Memorial by Prime Minister Paul Keating on 11 November 1993 . 
 = = = Construction and dedication : 1927 – 1934 = = = 
 The foundation stone was laid on 11 November 1927 , by the Governor of Victoria , Lord Somers . Although both the Victorian and Commonwealth governments made contributions , most of the cost of the Shrine ( £ 160 @,@ 000 out of a total of £ 250 @,@ 000 ; equating to about £ 8 @.@ 6 million out of £ 13 @.@ 5 million in 2016 ) was raised in less than six months by public contributions , with Monash as chief fundraiser . 
 Monash , who was also an engineer , took personal charge of the construction , which began in 1928 and was handled by the contractors Vaughan & Lodge . Monash died in 1931 , before the Shrine was finished , but the Shrine was the cause " closest to his heart " in his later years . 
 Work was finally completed in September 1934 , and the Shrine was formally dedicated on 11 November 1934 by the Duke of Gloucester , witnessed by a crowd of over 300 @,@ 000 people — a " massive turnout " given that Melbourne 's population at the time was approximately 1 million , and , according to Carl Bridge , the " largest crowd ever to assemble in Australia to that date " . 
 = = = Post World War II : 1945 – 1985 = = = 
 After World War II it was felt necessary to add to the Shrine an element commemorating the Australian war dead of the second great conflict . Once again a competition was run , with A. S. Fall and E. E. <unk> as the joint winners . <unk> 's design was eventually chosen as the one to go ahead , and the result was the World War II Forecourt , a wide expanse of stone in front of the Shrine 's north face ; the Eternal Flame , a permanent gas flame set just to the west of the north face ; and the World War II Memorial , a 12 @.@ 5 @-@ metre @-@ high ( 41 ft ) cenotaph a little further west . The Forecourt replaced a reflecting pool that had previously stood in front of the Shrine . These enlargements were dedicated by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 February 1954 . Australia 's involvements in later wars , such as the Korean War , the Borneo campaign ( 1945 ) , the Malayan Emergency , the Indonesian Confrontation in North Borneo and Sarawak , the Vietnam War and the Gulf War , are commemorated by inscriptions . 
 In 1951 the body of Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey , Australia 's military commander during World War II , was held at the Shrine for three days for public viewing followed by a State funeral on site . 20 @,@ 000 people visited the Shrine as he lay in state . 
 During the Vietnam War the Shrine became a centre of conflict when anti @-@ war demonstrators protested during ANZAC Day services against Australia 's involvement in the war . In 1971 the Shrine was defaced when the word <unk> ! was painted in large white letters on the pillars of the north portico . 
 In 1985 the Remembrance Garden was added beneath the western face of the Shrine to honour those who served during post @-@ World War II conflicts . 
 = = = Redevelopment : 2002 – present day = = = 
 Restoration work on the terraces surrounding the Shrine during the 1990s raised once again the possibility of taking advantage of the space under the Shrine : as the Shrine had been built on a hollow artificial hill , the undercroft ( although at the time filled with rubble from the construction ) provided a large space for development . At a planned cost of $ 5 @.@ 5 million , the new development was intended to provide a visitor 's centre , administration facilities and an improved access to the Shrine 's crypt , as many of the remaining veterans and their families found the stairs at the traditional ceremonial entrance difficult to climb . In redeveloping the site , special consideration was given to the positioning of the new entrance . The original plan was to use a tunnel from the east , but this was discarded as it had " no sense of ceremony " . Instead it was decided to develop two new courtyards , and place the new gallery under the northern steps . Construction commenced in 2002 , with the design by Melbourne architects Ashton Raggatt McDougall , and the new areas were opened in August 2003 . The completed project was awarded the Victorian Architecture Medal by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 2004 . 
 After this construction was complete , there were still more calls to further develop the site , and especially to provide facilities for education about the wars . A $ 62 million proposal was presented in 2006 , incorporating a museum and an underground carpark . Designed once again by Ashton Raggatt McDougall , the proposal was opposed by local residents and some council members , and ran into significant funding problems when the Federal Government decided not to provide funding . 
 In 2012 the Victorian Government announced that $ 22 @.@ 5 million would be allocated to redevelop the Shrine ’ s undercroft and extend it to the south . The new exhibition space , known as the " Galleries of Remembrance " , was opened on Remembrance Day in 2014 . A lifeboat from the ship SS <unk> , deployed during the landing at Anzac Cove at the start of the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915 , is a centrepiece of the new development . 
 = = Architecture and features = = 
 Materials for building the Shrine were sourced from within Australia : the chosen building stone was granodiorite quarried from Tynong ; the internal walls use sandstone from Redesdale ; and the black marble columns used stone from Buchan . This raised some concerns when redeveloping the Shrine , as the Tynong quarry was no longer in use , and it proved to be prohibitively expensive to reopen the site . Fortunately another quarry in the area was available and was able to provide the necessary stone . 
 = = = Exterior = = = 
 The design of the Shrine is based on the ancient Mausoleum of <unk> at Halicarnassus , one of the Seven Wonders of the World , and the Parthenon in Athens . It is a structure of square plan roofed by a stepped pyramid and entered on the north and south through classical porticos , each of eight fluted Doric columns supporting a pediment containing sculpture in high relief . The porticos are approached by wide flights of steps which rise in stages to the podium on which the Shrine sits . The east and west facing fronts are marked at the corners by four groups of statuary by Paul Raphael Montford , representing Peace , Justice , Patriotism and Sacrifice . The Art Deco style and motifs draw on Greek and Assyrian sculpture . The symbolism is Neo @-@ Classical . 
 Around the outer stone balustrade that marks the Shrine 's external boundary are the 16 stone " battle honours " discs . These represent the battle honours granted by King George V and commemorate Australia 's contributions to the following battles : Landing at Anzac ( Gallipoli ) , Sari Bair , <unk> , Gaza @-@ Beersheba , the North Sea , the Cocos Islands , Megiddo , Damascus , Villers Bretonneux , Amiens , Mont St Quentin , the Hindenburg Line , Ypres , Messines , Pozieres and Bullecourt . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 Inside the Shrine is the Sanctuary , a high vaulted space entered by four tall portals of Classical design . A simple <unk> is carried on sixteen tall fluted Ionic columns and supports a frieze with twelve relief panels sculptured by Lyndon <unk> , depicting the armed services at work and in action during World War I. At the centre of the Sanctuary is the Stone of Remembrance . This is a marble stone sunk below the pavement , so that visitors must bow their heads to read the inscription on it : 
 GREATER LOVE <unk> NO MAN 
 The inscription is part of a verse from the Bible ( John 15 : 13 ) " Greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends " . The Stone is aligned with an aperture in the roof of the Sanctuary so that a ray of sunlight falls on the word LOVE on the Stone of Remembrance at exactly 11 a.m. on 11 November , marking the hour and day of the Armistice which ended World War I. Since the introduction of daylight saving in Victoria , the ray of sunlight is no longer in the right place at 11 a.m. A mirror has been installed to direct sunlight onto the Stone at 11 a.m. During the rest of the year , a light is used to simulate the effect . 
 Monash , with the advice of Professor T. G. Tucker and the assistance of Bernard O 'Dowd and Felix Meyer , reworded Phillip Hudson 's inscription which appears on the western wall of the Shrine : 
 LET ALL MEN KNOW THAT THIS IS <unk> <unk> . THIS <unk> , <unk> IN THE HEARTS OF MEN AS ON THE <unk> EARTH , <unk> A PEOPLE 'S <unk> AND <unk> . <unk> <unk> THAT COME AFTER , <unk> <unk> . 
 This inscription again aroused criticism , according to Taylor , " for having no Christian , ( or , indeed , religious ) , element " , but was considered to fit the Australian tradition of " stoic patriotism " . 
 The inscription on the eastern wall , not written by Monash , reads : 
 THIS MONUMENT WAS ERECTED BY A <unk> PEOPLE TO THE <unk> MEMORY OF THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO <unk> THE <unk> IN THE GREAT WAR OF 1914 – 1918 . 
 The Sanctuary is surrounded by an ambulatory , or passage , along which are forty @-@ two bronze caskets containing hand @-@ written , illuminated Books of Remembrance with the names of every Victorian who enlisted for active service with the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) or Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force in World War I or died in camp prior to embarkation . 
 = = = Crypt = = = 
 Beneath the Sanctuary is the Crypt containing a bronze statue of a father and son , representing the two generations who served in the two world wars . Around the walls are panels listing every unit of the AIF , down to battalion and regiment , along with the colours of their shoulder patch . The Crypt is hung with the standards of various battalions and regiments , listing their battle honours . 
 = = = Visitor Centre = = = 
 Visitors approach the shrine through the Entrance Courtyard , with " Lest We Forget " inscribed on one wall and a quote from former Governor @-@ General Sir William Deane on the other . The Garden Courtyard , on the same alignment , features the Legacy Olive Tree and a seating area . Both courtyards are finished in Tynong Granite . 
 The gallery of Medals has a 40 @-@ metre @-@ long ( 130 ft ) wall displaying around 4000 medals , each symbolically representing 100 Victorians who have served in war and peacekeeping operations , and six who have died . A feature of the gallery is the Victoria Cross awarded to Captain Robert Grieve during the Battle of Messines in 1917 . The Cross was lent to the Shrine by Wesley College , Melbourne . 
 = = = World War II Forecourt = = = 
 The cenotaph is a tall pillar constructed of Harcourt Granite . Inscribed on its surface are the names of the defence forces , together with the theatres of war they served in . Atop the cenotaph is a basalt sculpture of six servicemen carrying a bier with a corpse , draped by the Australian flag . The sculpture symbolises " the debt of the living to the dead " . The Eternal Flame is placed nearby , representing eternal life . The flame has burned continuously with few interruptions since it was first lit . 
 At the other side of the forecourt are three flagpoles . The usual arrangement comprises the Australian flag on the left , the Victorian flag in the middle and one of the flags of the three defence forces on the right . Other flags may be flown on special occasions , arranged according to strict protocols .

 Although the original architects had proposed including four statues of war leaders , Monash rejected this plan . Instead there were to be no statues representing individual members of the Australian Defence Force at the shrine itself , although a number of statues were to be added in the surrounding parklands . The first of these was " The Man With The Donkey " , representing John Simpson Kirkpatrick , although he was not named on the statue . Officially the work is said to represent the " valour and compassion of the Australian soldier " . The statue , by Wallace Anderson , was installed in 1936 on the initiative of women who had funded a " Mother 's Tribute " . A statue of Monash was also commissioned and was designed by Leslie Bowles . Casting was due to begin in 1938 , but the onset of World War II delayed work , and thus it was not installed until 1950 , and , as with Simpson and his donkey , was located away from the shrine . 
 The Shrine is set in a large expanse of parkland officially called Kings Domain . Over the years many other war memorials have been built in this area , including the Australian @-@ Hellenic Memorial to Australian and Greek dead in the Battles of Greece and Crete in 1941 , and statues of Monash and Blamey . Most of the trees which line the approaches to the Shrine bear plaques commemorating individual Army units , naval vessels or Air Force squadrons , placed there by veterans ' groups . An older memorial to Victorians killed in the Second Boer War of 1899 – 1902 is also located nearby on the corner of St Kilda and Domain Roads . 
 The Driver and Wipers Memorial , also in the Shrine reserve , commemorates the thousands of Australian lives lost during the fighting at Ypres ; " Wipers " is the way servicemen pronounced " Ypres " during World War I. The bronze soldiers are the work of the British sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger and originally stood outside the Museum and State Library of Victoria in Melbourne . They were transferred to the Shrine in 1998 . The Driver is a soldier holding a horse whip and bridles , wearing breeches , a protective <unk> , spurs , and a steel helmet . The figure is a recasting of one of the figures from the Royal Artillery Memorial in Hyde Park , London , UK . The other bronze , the " Wipers " figure , is a British infantry soldier standing guard with standard issue .303 rifle , bayonet fixed , a German helmet at his feet . This too is a recasting , taken from the Hoylake and West Kirby War Memorial in Merseyside , UK . 
 On 19 July 2008 , being the 92nd anniversary of the Battle of Fromelles , a replica of the 1998 sculpture by Peter Corlett in the Australian Memorial Park , Fromelles was unveiled . This depicts Sergeant Simon Fraser , 57th Battalion , ( a farmer from <unk> , Victoria ) , rescuing a wounded compatriot from no man 's land after the battle . 
 Near to the Shrine entrance is the Legacy Garden of Appreciation , which was established in 1978 . This cross @-@ shaped garden is outlined by hedges . Red Flanders Poppies , planted from seed originating from Villers @-@ Bretonneux in France , flower in late spring . A sculpture by Louis <unk> , Widow and Children , was commissioned to mark the 75th anniversary of Legacy Australia in 1998 . The Women 's Garden , to the north of the shrine , incorporates concrete memorial violets within a grove of jacarandas . The focus of the garden is The Ex @-@ Servicewomen ’ s Memorial Cairn ( 1985 ) which was relocated from the King 's Domain in 2010 . 
 A Lone Pine ( Pinus <unk> ) was planted in 1933 near the north @-@ east corner of the Shrine by Lieutenant @-@ General Sir Stanley Savige , founder of Melbourne Legacy at a formal ceremony . It was one of four seedlings planted in Victoria from seeds of a cone brought back from Gallipoli by Sgt. Keith McDowell . The tree was removed in August 2012 having succumbed to disease caused by the fungus <unk> pinea . A " grandchild tree " was planted nearby in 2006 . 
 = = Commemorative services = = 
 For the past 70 years the Shrine has been the centre of war commemoration in Melbourne . Although Remembrance Day ( 11 November ) is the official day for commemorating the war dead , it has gradually been eclipsed in the public estimation by ANZAC Day ( 25 April ) , which unlike Remembrance Day is a specifically Australian ( and New Zealand ) day of commemoration . ANZAC day at the Shrine is observed through a number of ceremonies . The first of these is the Dawn Service , an event that attracted a record crowd of more than 35 @,@ 000 in 2007 . This is followed by an official wreath @-@ laying service where officials march to the Shrine and lay wreaths in the Sanctuary . Later , the ANZAC Day March approaches the Shrine via St Kilda Road and the forecourt , before being dismissed at the steps and is followed by a commemoration service held between 1 : 00 and 1 : 30 p.m. 
 On Remembrance Day , Victorian leaders and community members gather to commemorate " the sacrifices made by Australians in all wars and conflicts " . A minutes silence is observed at 11 a.m. as the Ray of Light illuminates the word LOVE on the Stone of Remembrance . 
 Throughout the rest of the year , ceremonies and wreath laying services are held by Victorian unit associations and battalions in the Sanctuary , around memorials in the Shrine Reserve and near remembrance trees specific to various associations . 
 = = Management = = 
 The Shrine is managed by the Shrine of Remembrance Trustees , ten individuals appointed by the Governor in Council , on the advice of the Minister for Veterans ' Affairs in the Victorian Government . The Trustees are responsible for the care , management , maintenance and preservation of the Shrine and Shrine Reserve . 
 Traditionally , security for the Shrine has been provided by the Shrine Guard , whose members were men with a military background . All of the original twelve members of the Shrine Guard had won bravery medals during World War I. When the Shrine Guard merged with the Victoria Police Protective Service , some civilians began to serve . During the hours the Shrine is open to the public or in use for any ceremony , they wear a uniform representing an Australian Light Horseman of World War I , with Victoria Police Force insignia .

 Andrew Lawrence Crofts ( born 29 May 1984 ) is a Wales international footballer . 
 He started his career with Gillingham , for whom he made his Football League debut at the age of 16 , and made over 190 appearances for the Kent @-@ based club . He had loans at Peterborough United and Wrexham during the 2008 – 09 season and joined Brighton & Hove Albion in 2009 . After a successful season at Brighton he transferred to Norwich City in 2010 , before moving back to the South Coast club in 2012 .

 In September 2000 , Crofts joined Gillingham as a trainee and was a regular in the club 's youth and reserve teams during the 2000 – 01 season . At the end of the season , shortly before his 17th birthday , he was a surprise inclusion in the first team squad for a match at home to Watford , and made his Football League debut as a late substitute , replacing Marlon King . The following season he suffered a broken leg during a reserve team match and missed several months of the season . Although he returned to action in early 2002 , his next appearance for the first team did not come until October , when he came on as a substitute in a League Cup match against Stockport County . This was to be his only senior appearance of the 2002 – 03 season . He finally secured a regular first team place towards the end of the following season , featuring regularly during March and April 2004 . 
 Crofts was a first team regular in the 2004 – 05 season , making 27 Football League appearances , and scoring his first senior goal for the club in a defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion on 26 December . In January 2005 , he signed a new contract designed to keep him at the club until 2009 . He was omitted from the team for most of March and April , but was recalled for the last match of the season , in which a draw with Nottingham Forest led to the " Gills " being relegated from the Football League Championship , the second tier of English football , to Football League One , the third tier . In the 2005 – 06 season , he made the most appearances of any player in the Gillingham squad , missing only one of the team 's 46 matches in League One . Although the team struggled in the league , finishing in the lower half of the table , they defeated Premier League team Portsmouth in the League Cup , with Crofts scoring the winning goal . The following season , he again made over 40 appearances and also scored eight goals , his best total for an individual season , but Gillingham again finished the season in the bottom half of the table . He made his 100th start for the club on 18 December 2006 in a match against Bournemouth , and marked the occasion with a goal . At the end of the season , he won four awards at the club 's Player of the Year event and was dubbed Mr Gillingham by then @-@ manager Ronnie Jepson . He took over as team captain in the 2007 – 08 season , but it was an unsuccessful season for the team , who were relegated from League One . The following October he was stripped of the captaincy , which was instead given to Barry Fuller . Manager Mark Stimson stated that he felt that the captaincy might have been too much of a burden for Crofts , and had a negative effect on his form . Soon afterwards , the club made Crofts available for transfer .

 = Drymoreomys = 
 Drymoreomys is a rodent genus in the tribe Oryzomyini that lives in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil . The single species , D. albimaculatus , is known only from the states of São Paulo and Santa Catarina and was not named until 2011 . It lives in the humid forest on the eastern slopes of the Serra do Mar and perhaps reproduces year @-@ round . Although its range is relatively large and includes some protected areas , it is patchy and threatened , and the discoverers recommend that the animal be considered " Near Threatened " on the IUCN Red List . Within Oryzomyini , Drymoreomys appears to be most closely related to Eremoryzomys from the Andes of Peru , a biogeographically unusual relationship , in that the two populations are widely separated and each is adapted to an arid or a moist environment . 
 With a body mass of 44 – 64 g ( 1 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 3 oz ) , Drymoreomys is a medium @-@ sized rodent with long fur that is orange to reddish @-@ buff above and grayish with several white patches below . The pads on the hindfeet are very well developed and there is brown fur on the upper sides of the feet . The tail is brown above and below . The front part of the skull is relatively long and the ridges on the braincase are weak . The palate is short , with its back margin between the third molars . Several traits of the genitals are not seen in any other oryzomyine rodent . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Drymoreomys was first recorded in 1992 by <unk> <unk> in the state of São Paulo . The animal was not , however , formally described until 2011 , when Alexandre Percequillo and colleagues named it as a new genus and species within the tribe Oryzomyini : Drymoreomys albimaculatus . The generic name , Drymoreomys , combines the Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " forest " , <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " mountain @-@ dwelling " , and μῦς ( mys ) , meaning " mouse " . The name refers to the animal 's occurrence in mountain forest . The specific name , albimaculatus , derives from the Latin albus , meaning " white " , and maculatus , meaning " spotted " , a reference to the spots of white in the animal 's fur . Percequillo and colleagues found little geographic variation among samples of Drymoreomys , although a few traits differ in frequency between populations from the states of São Paulo and Santa Catarina . 
 According to a phylogenetic analysis of evidence from morphology , the nuclear gene IRBP , and the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b , Drymoreomys albimaculatus is most closely related to Eremoryzomys polius , an oryzomyine from northern Peru and the only species in the genus Eremoryzomys . Together , Drymoreomys and Eremoryzomys are part of Marcelo Weksler 's clade D , one of four main clades within Oryzomyini . Some subsequent studies did not support a relationship between the Drymoreomys – Eremoryzomys clade and the rest of clade D , but this is probably due to saturation of the phylogenetic signal in mitochondrial data . Oryzomyini includes well over a hundred species distributed mainly in South America , including nearby islands such as the Galápagos Islands and some of the Antilles . It is one of several tribes recognized within the subfamily Sigmodontinae , which encompasses hundreds of species found across South America and into southern North America . Sigmodontinae is the largest subfamily of the family Cricetidae , other members of which include voles , lemmings , hamsters , and deermice , all mainly from Eurasia and North America .

 = = = External morphology = = = 
 Drymoreomys albimaculatus is a medium @-@ sized , long @-@ tailed , short @-@ eared , short @-@ footed rodent . It is quite distinct from other oryzomyines and has a number of unique traits . In 11 adults from Parque Natural Municipal <unk> do Garcia in Santa Catarina , head and body length was 122 to 139 mm ( 4 @.@ 8 to 5 @.@ 5 in ) , tail length was 140 to 175 mm ( 5 @.@ 5 to 6 @.@ 9 in ) , hindfoot length was 25 @.@ 8 to 30 @.@ 5 mm ( 1 @.@ 02 to 1 @.@ 20 in ) , ear length was 16 to 22 mm ( 0 @.@ 63 to 0 @.@ 87 in ) , and body mass was 44 to 64 g ( 1 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 3 oz ) . The fur is long and dense and consists of thin , short , woolly underfur and long , thick <unk> . Overall , the fur of the upperparts is orange to reddish @-@ buff . In the closely related Eremoryzomys , the upperparts are grayish . The hairs of the underfur , which are 12 to 14 mm ( 0 @.@ 47 to 0 @.@ 55 in ) long , are grayish for most of their length and orange or brown at the tip . In the <unk> , the cover hairs ( which form the main body of the fur ) , are 14 to 17 mm ( 0 @.@ 55 to 0 @.@ 67 in ) long and brown at the tip , with an orange band below the tip , and the longer , sparse guard hairs are red to dark brown in the half closest to the tip and are 17 to 21 mm ( 0 @.@ 67 to 0 @.@ 83 in ) long . The sides are reddish brown . On the underparts , the hairs are grayish at the base and white at the tip , except on the throat , chest , and ( in some specimens ) groin , where the hairs are entirely white — a trait unique among the oryzomyines . In overall appearance , the underparts are grayish , with white spots where the hairs are completely white . 
 The small , rounded ears are covered with dense golden hairs on the outer and with reddish brown hairs on the inner surface . The mystacial vibrissae ( whiskers on the upper lip ) are long , usually extending a little beyond the ears when laid back against the head , but the superciliary vibrissae ( whiskers above the eyes ) are short and do not extend beyond the ears . The upper surface on the forefeet is covered with brown fur , and there is white or silvery fur on the digits . Ungual tufts ( fur around the bases of the claws ) are present on the second through fourth digits . On the short , fairly broad hindfeet , the upper side is covered densely with silvery to white hairs near the tips of the feet and toes , and with brown fur otherwise . No other oryzomyine has such brown fur on its hindfeet . The second through fourth digits have long silvery @-@ white ungual tufts , but those on the first digit are short . On the sole , the pads are very large . Among oryzomyines , only Oecomys and the extinct Megalomys have similarly large pads between their digits . There is a dense cover of short brown hairs on both the upper and lower sides of the tail . Unlike in Eremoryzomys , the tail is the same color above and below . The tail ends in a tuft , an unusual feature among oryzomyines . 
 = = = Skull = = = 
 In the skull , the rostrum ( front part ) is relatively long . The nasal and premaxillary bones extend in front of the incisors , forming a rostral tube , which is shared among oryzomyines only with Handleyomys . The zygomatic notch ( a notch formed by a projection at the front of the zygomatic plate , a bony plate at the side of the skull ) is shallow . The interorbital region ( between the eyes ) is narrow and long , with the narrowest part towards the front . The crests on the braincase and interorbital region are weakly developed . Eremoryzomys has larger crests on its interorbital region . 
 The incisive foramina ( openings in the front part of the palate ) are long , sometimes extending to between the first molars ( M1 ) . The bony palate is broad and short , with the posterior margin between the third molars ( M3 ) . Nephelomys <unk> is the only other oryzomyine with such a short palate , although that of Eremoryzomys polius is only slightly longer . The posterolateral palatal pits ( openings in the back part of the palate near the M3 ) vary from small to fairly large and are located in slight fossas ( depressions ) . In Eremoryzomys , these fossas are deeper . The roof of the mesopterygoid fossa , the opening behind the palate , is completely closed or contains small sphenopalatine vacuities . The vacuities are much larger in Eremoryzomys . The alisphenoid strut , a piece of bone that separates two foramina ( openings ) , is present in all Drymoreomys specimens examined , except in one juvenile specimen . 
 The mandible ( lower jaw ) is long and low . The coronoid process , the frontmost of the three main processes ( projections ) at the back of the jawbone , is large and about as high as the condyloid process behind it . The angular process , below the condyloid , is fairly short and does not extend further backwards than the condyloid . There is no noticeable capsular process ( a raising at the back of the jaw that houses the root of the lower incisor ) . 
 = = = Dentition = = = 
 The upper incisors are opisthodont ( with the cutting surface oriented backwards ) and have orange to yellow enamel . The upper molar rows are either almost parallel or slightly convergent with each other toward the front . Holochilus and Lundomys are the only other oryzomyines with non @-@ parallel molar rows . The valleys between the cusps of the upper molars extending from the inner and outer sides overlap slightly across the midlines of the teeth . The molars are high @-@ cusped , almost hypsodont . On M1 , the anterocone ( the front cusp ) is divided into two cuspules on the lingual ( inner , towards the tongue ) and labial ( outer , towards the lips ) sides of the teeth . The mesoloph , a crest near the middle of the labial side of the tooth , is long and well developed on each of the three upper molars . On the lower molars ( m1 to m3 ) , the cusps on the labial side are located slightly in front of their lingual counterparts . The anteroconid , the front cusp on the m1 , is divided in two . The m1 , m2 , and usually m3 have a mesolophid , a crest corresponding to the mesoloph but located on the lingual side . Each of the lower molars has two roots . 
 = = = Other anatomy = = = 
 There are 12 ribs and 19 <unk> ( chest and abdomen ) , four sacral , and 36 to 38 caudal ( tail ) vertebrae . There are three digits at the tip of the penis , of which the central one is the largest . The two lateral digits are not supported by mounds of the baculum ( penis bone ) . There is only one spine on the papilla ( nipple @-@ like projection ) on the upper side of the penis . On the urethral process , located in the crater at the end of the penis , a fleshy process at the side , the lateral lobule , is present . The preputial glands ( glands in front of the genitals ) are large . The lack of lateral <unk> mounds , presence of a lateral lobule , and size of the preputial glands are all unique traits among the oryzomyines . 
 = = = Karyotype = = = 
 The karyotype of Drymoreomys albimaculatus is 2n = 62 , FN = 62 : the animal has 62 chromosomes , and 29 pairs of autosomes ( non @-@ sex chromosomes ) are acrocentric ( with one arm so short as to be almost invisible ) and one small pair is metacentric ( with two equally long arms ) . Both sex chromosomes are submetacentric ( with one arm noticeably longer than the other ) , and X is larger than Y. Blocks of heterochromatin are present on all autosomes and the long arm of Y. <unk> sequences are found near the centromeres of the sex chromosomes . Aspects of this karyotype — with a high number of mostly acrocentric chromosomes and the presence of heterochromatin on the Y chromosome — are consistent with the pattern seen in other oryzomyines . However , no other oryzomyine has exactly the same karyotype as D. albimaculatus . Other species in clade D have fewer chromosomes , down to 16 in Nectomys <unk> , although the karyotype of Eremoryzomys polius is unknown . This suggests an evolutionary trend of decreasing chromosome number within the clade . 
 = = Distribution and ecology = = 
 Drymoreomys albimaculatus occurs in the Atlantic Forest on the eastern slopes of the Serra do Mar in the Brazilian states of São Paulo and Santa Catarina , at 650 to 1 @,@ 200 m ( 2 @,@ 130 to 3 @,@ 940 ft ) above sea level . It has not been found in the intervening state of Paraná , but is likely to occur there . The biogeographical pattern indicated by the relationship between Drymoreomys and the Andean Eremoryzomys is unusual . While there are some similar cases of relationships between Andean and Atlantic Forest animals , these involve inhabitants of humid forests in the Andes ; Eremoryzomys , by contrast , lives in an arid area . 
 Drymoreomys albimaculatus appears to be a specialist of dense , moist , montane and <unk> forest . It has been found in disturbed and secondary forests as well as in pristine forest , but probably needs contiguous forest to survive . Reproductive activity has been observed in females in June , November , and December and in males in December , suggesting that the species breeds year @-@ round . Although some of its morphological traits , such as the very large pads , are suggestive of arboreal ( tree @-@ dwelling ) habits , most specimens were collected in pitfall traps on the ground . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 The range of Drymoreomys albimaculatus is relatively large and the species occurs in several protected areas , but it has only been found in seven localities and its habitat is threatened by deforestation and fragmentation . Therefore , Percequillo and colleagues suggest that the species be assessed as " Near Threatened " under the IUCN Red List criteria . 
 = Homer 's Barbershop Quartet = 
 " Homer 's Barbershop Quartet " is the first episode of The Simpsons ' fifth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 30 , 1993 . The episode was written by Jeff Martin and directed by Mark Kirkland . It features The Be Sharps , a barbershop quartet founded by Homer Simpson . The band 's story roughly parallels that of The Beatles . George Harrison and David Crosby guest star as themselves , and The Dapper Dans provide the singing voices of The Be Sharps . 
 The episode begins with the Simpson family as they attend a swap meet . There , Bart Simpson and his sister Lisa notice a picture of their father , Homer , on the cover of an old LP album . Homer explains to his family that he , Principal Skinner , Barney Gumble , and Apu Nahasapeemapetilon recorded a barbershop quartet album in 1985 , which catapulted them to national fame . He narrates to his family the story of how the band formed , reached the pinnacle of success , and eventually folded . At the end of the episode , the group reunites to perform a concert on the roof of Moe 's Tavern , singing their number @-@ one hit " Baby on Board " . 
 Throughout the episode , several references are made to The Beatles and other popular culture icons . In its original American broadcast , " Homer 's Barbershop Quartet " finished 30th in ratings , with a Nielsen rating of 12 @.@ 7 . It was praised for its The Beatles cameo , despite being a leftover episode from the previous season . Reviews that criticized the episode 's inconsistent humor blamed it on the change of writers before the episode 's creation . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At the Springfield Swap Meet , Bart and Lisa Simpson notice Homer on the cover of an LP album . Homer explains that he , Principal Skinner , Barney , and Apu recorded a barbershop quartet album in 1985 , which catapulted them to national fame . He then tells his family the story of how the album came to be . While performing at Moe 's Tavern , an agent offered to represent the group as a band , but only on the condition that they expel Chief Wiggum , who was the band 's fourth member at the time . After Homer abandons Wiggum in the woods , an audition is held during which the band rejected candidates to fill Wiggum 's position , among others Jasper <unk> , Groundskeeper Willie and Wiggum disguised as Doctor Dolittle , the trio returned <unk> to Moe 's Tavern , where they recruited Barney after hearing him sing in a beautiful Irish tenor voice . The four members then brainstormed on a name for the group , eventually settling on The Be Sharps . 
 In the present , Homer brags that he sold his car 's spare tire at the swap meet . On the way home , one of their tires blows out . While Marge walks to a gas station to get a new tire , Homer continues his story . He tells Bart and Lisa that after Marge bought a Baby on board sign , Homer wrote a song inspired by the fad . The song " Baby on Board " appeared on the group 's first album , Meet The Be Sharps , and the song became a hit . The Be Sharps performed the song at the Statue of Liberty 's centennial in 1986 , and they later won a Grammy Award for Outstanding Soul , Spoken Word , or Barbershop Album of the Year for Meet The Be Sharps . 
 Back in the present , the Simpsons are at home , where Homer explains that The Be Sharps became so popular that they were featured on merchandise , including lunch boxes , mugs , and posters . The band later released their second album , Bigger than Jesus . While The Be Sharps grew in fame , creative disputes arose when Barney dated a Japanese conceptual artist ( a parody of Yoko Ono ) , which eventually led to his leaving the group . Barney and his girlfriend recorded a song in which his girlfriend repeatedly says " Number 8 " over tape loops of Barney 's belches ( a parody of The Beatles ' " Revolution 9 " ) . Ultimately , the group realized they were no longer popular . The latest issue of Us Weekly 's What 's Hot and What 's Not confirmed this , noting that the band was no longer " hot " . The band then split up ; Principal Skinner returned to the Springfield Elementary School , Apu to the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart , Barney back to Moe 's Tavern , and Homer to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant , where his position has temporarily been filled by a chicken . Returning to the present day , the group reunites to perform a concert on the roof of Moe 's Tavern , singing their number one hit " Baby on Board " . Pedestrians stop and listen to them singing their comeback concert , including George Harrison of The Beatles , who dismissively remarks , " It 's been done . " 
 = = Production = = 
 One of the writers for The Simpsons suggested that they should create an episode that focuses on Homer in a barbershop quartet and " a big parody of The Beatles " . The episode was written by Jeff Martin , who was an " obsessive " Beatles fan , making him " a natural to write [ the episode ] " . Mark Kirkland , a " huge " Beatles fan , directed the episode , and ensured that The Beatles references were accurate . Kirkland enjoyed directing the episode because unlike other episodes he directed , he did not experience any trouble animating " Homer 's Barbershop Quartet " . The animators liked creating The Beatles gags and enjoyed the barbershop music . After the animators synchronized the audio track , music , and animation , they " just fell in love " with it . They also enjoyed working on the choreography of The Be Sharps and trying to match the characters ' movements with the music . They were inspired by The Beatles film Let It Be , including the shots of the band in the recording studio where they decide to break up . Kirkland did not think there was anything " spectacular " in the episode 's animation , but he and his animation team " just loved " working on it . 
 In a scene in the episode , Lisa sees a man selling an original Malibu Stacy doll from 1958 that has big , pointed breasts . The man , nicknamed " Wiseguy " by the show 's staff , tells Lisa that " they took [ the doll ] off the market after some kid put both his eyes out . " The joke received a censor note from the Fox network 's censors because they did not want such jokes on the show , but the producers ignored the note and the joke appeared in the episode when it aired . 
 The Be Sharps 's singing voices were provided by the four members of The Dapper Dans , a barbershop quartet that performs at Disneyland in Anaheim , California . Before working on the episode , Martin had seen one of the quartet 's performances and enjoyed it . When the episode 's production began , he contacted the quartet , and they agreed to make a guest appearance in the episode . The Dapper Dans 's singing was intermixed with the normal voice actors ' voices , often with a regular voice actor singing the melody and The Dapper Dans providing backup . 
 George Harrison guest stars in the episode as himself . He was the second Beatles member after Ringo Starr ( in " Brush with Greatness " ) to appear on The Simpsons . When Harrison arrived at the recording studio in West Los Angeles to record his lines , the casting director told the episode 's show runners , Al Jean and Mike Reiss , that Harrison was coming and that they were not allowed to tell anybody about it because it was intended to be a secret to the staff . Jean , Reiss , and the show 's creator Matt Groening went to see Harrison in the studio , and when they returned to the writer 's room , Groening said , " Guess who I just met ? George Harrison ! " , not knowing that it was supposed to be a secret . Harrison arrived at the studio by himself without any entourage or bodyguards . Groening recalls that Harrison was " pretty glum " , and he was unenthusiastic when the staff asked him questions about The Beatles . However , when Groening asked Harrison about the Wonderwall Music album , he suddenly " <unk> up " because it was one of his solo albums that he was rarely questioned on . Harrison 's guest appearance was one of Groening 's favorites because he was " super nice " and " very sweet " to the staff . Jean said it was a " huge thrill " to have him appear . David Crosby also makes a guest appearance in the episode as himself , and appears in the scene in which he presents a Grammy award to The Be Sharps . 
 " Homer 's Barbershop Quartet " was a hold @-@ over episode from the season four production line . It was chosen to air as the fifth season 's premiere episode because it guest starred Harrison . The Fox network executives wanted to premiere with Conan O 'Brien 's episode " Homer Goes to College " because of its parody of the 1978 comedy film National Lampoon 's Animal House , but the writers felt " Homer 's Barbershop Quartet " would be a better choice because of Harrison 's involvement . The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 30 , 1993 . It was included in a 2002 video collection of selected musical @-@ themed episodes titled The Simpsons : Backstage Pass . The episode was also included in The Simpsons season five DVD set , which was released on December 21 , 2004 . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The episode makes several references to The Beatles . Their first album , Meet the Be Sharps , is a parody of the Meet the Beatles album . Moe 's Tavern changes its name to Moe 's Cavern , a reference to the Cavern Club in Liverpool where The Beatles frequently performed in the early 1960s . Chief Wiggum , thrown out of the band because he was " too Village People " , mirrors Pete Best . Best was an early member of The Beatles but was replaced by Ringo Starr . The cover of Bigger Than Jesus , The Be Sharps ' second album , features the group walking on water , which is a direct parody of the art on The Beatles ' album Abbey Road . The name is a reference to a controversial quote made by John Lennon in 1966 . Bart references this by asking , " What did you do [ to lose your popularity ] ? Screw up like The Beatles and say you were bigger than Jesus ? " , to which Homer replies " All the time . That was the title of our second album . " At the end of the episode , the album 's back cover is revealed , on which Homer is seen turned away from the camera , as opposed to the rest of the band . This is a parody of the Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band LP reverse , in which Paul McCartney is in the same position . Barney 's Japanese conceptual artist girlfriend is a parody of Yoko Ono . Their song repeats the phrase " Number 8 " and a burp by Barney , a reference to The Beatles ' " Revolution 9 " . The group performing atop Moe 's Tavern at the end of the episode is a parody of The Beatles ' impromptu concert on the Apple Corps rooftop during their Get Back recording sessions in 1969 , hence George Harrison 's line , " It 's been done . " In addition , The Be Sharps are wearing the same outfits as The Beatles during the rooftop concert scene : Barney in a brown fur coat ( John ) , Homer in a bright red coat ( Ringo ) , Skinner in a black suit ( Paul ) , and Apu in a black Mongolian lamb coat with green trousers ( George ) . After the performance , Homer says , " I 'd like to thank you on behalf of the group and I hope we passed the audition " , paraphrasing a quote by John Lennon at the end of The Beatles rooftop performance . 
 At the swap meet , Mayor Quimby says " Ich bin ein Springfield Swap Meet Patron " , a parody of John F. Kennedy 's famous Cold War quote . Homer browses through a box with items that cost five cents each . These include the United States Declaration of Independence , a copy of Action Comics # 1 , a complete block of Inverted Jenny misprint postal stamps , and a Stradivarius violin . Principal Skinner tries on a prison mask with the number 24601 , notable as Jean Valjean 's prison number in Les Misérables . Homer buys Grampa a pink Cadillac , just as Elvis Presley did for his mother . One of the late night television shows Chief Wiggum watches is Johnny Carson doing his Carnac the Magnificent routine . Homer mentions that 1985 was the year that Joe Piscopo left the NBC sketch show Saturday Night Live . Moe sells oyster shells at the swap meet that resemble Lucille Ball . Homer begins telling the story of The Be Sharps by saying , " Rock and roll had become stagnant . ' Achy Breaky Heart ' was seven years away ; something had to fill the void . That something was barbershop . " At the Grammy ceremony , Spinal Tap , Michael Jackson ( Leon Kompowsky ) and George Harrison are all at the post awards reception and MC Hammer in the audience . While Bart and Lisa browse through LP albums at the swap meet , they find a recording of " Yankee Doodle " by Melvin and the Squirrels , a band that spoofs Alvin and the Chipmunks as well as a Spinal Tap album .

 = Gilwell Park = 
 Gilwell Park is a camp site and activity centre for Scouting groups and all Youth Organisations , as well as a training and conference centre for Scout Leaders with many business and local groups using the facilities , including the hosting of social events such as weddings and birthday parties . The 44 hectare ( 109 acre ) site is in <unk> , Epping Forest , close to Chingford , London . 
 In the late Middle Ages the area was a farm , growing to a wealthy estate that fell into disrepair towards 1900 . It was bought in 1919 by Scout Commissioner William de Bois Maclaren and given to the Scout Association of the United Kingdom to provide camping to London Scouts , and training for Scouters . As Scout Leaders from all countries of the world have come to Gilwell Park for their Wood Badge training , it is one of the landmarks of the world Scouting movement . 
 The site contains camp fields for small patrols and can camp up to 3 @,@ 000 people , indoor accommodation , historical sites , monuments of Scouting , and activities suitable for all sections of the Scouting Movement . It can accommodate events up to 10 @,@ 000 people . Accommodation at Gilwell Park can be hired for non @-@ Scout activities such as school group camping , wedding receptions and conferences . 
 Gilwell Park is one of ten national Scout Activity Centres of the Scout Association , with Baden @-@ Powell House , Downe , Great Tower , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> Crofts , <unk> and Yr Hafod . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Original farm in late Middle Ages = = = 
 The history of Gilwell Park can be traced to 1407 , when John Crow owned <unk> , the land that would eventually become Gilwell Park . Between 1407 and 1422 , Crow sold the land to Richard Rolfe , and the area became known as <unk> , " Gill " being Old English for glen . Following Rolfe 's death in 1422 , different sections of the property came to be called " Great Gilwell " and " Little Gilwell " . The two areas were named after the Old English " <unk> " , or spring . A farmhouse has stood at Gilwell Farm ever since . 
 Around this time , an adjoining 5 @.@ 6 hectares ( 14 acres ) property was purchased by Richard Osborne . In 1442 , he built a large dwelling called Osborne Hall , which stood for 300 years . Legend has it that in the early 16th century , King Henry VIII owned the land and built a hunting lodge for his son Edward . Around 1736 the highwayman Dick Turpin began using Gilwell 's forests to conceal himself and for ambushing travellers and freight along roads leading into London . 
 In 1754 , William Skrimshire purchased Great Gilwell , Little Gilwell , and half of Osborne 's estate , including Osborne Hall . Skrimshire demolished Osborne Hall and built a new residence , which he also called Osborne Hall . That building is now called the White House . Timbers in the White House can be dated to this time , but not to any previous era . Leonard Tresilian ( ? – 1792 ) bought the estate in 1771 and expanded the land holdings and size of the residence . 
 Tresilian 's first wife , Margaret Holland , died young after bearing three daughters . He then married Elizabeth <unk> . Desiring that Gilwell pass on to his eldest daughter , also named Margaret ( 1750 – <unk> ) , Tresilian drew up a detailed prenuptial agreement with <unk> 's father . By the time of Tresilian 's death in 1792 , the younger Margaret had married William Bassett Chinnery ( 1766 – 1834 ) , the elder brother of the painter George Chinnery . 
 = = = Rich estate in 18th century = = = 
 The <unk> were wealthy and influential . William Chinnery 's father , also named William , owned trading ships and named one Gilwell in 1800 . William and Margaret Chinnery initially resided in London , and after three years of marriage and inheriting Gilwell in 1792 , they moved to Gilwell in 1793 . They soon shocked the populace by renaming Osborne Hall to " Gilwell Hall " . William Chinnery expanded Gilwell 's land holdings through significant purchases over 15 years and , with his wife , transformed it into a country estate with gardens , paths , and statues . Parts of the garden , paths , and dwelling modifications exist into the 21st century . William Chinnery was exposed as the embezzler of a small fortune from the British Treasury where he worked and was dismissed from all his posts on 12 March 1812 . Margaret Chinnery was forced to sign over Gilwell Estate to the Exchequer on 2 July 1812 . 
 The Chinnery family was prominent enough that members of the English nobility visited often during the 1790s and early 19th century . King George III visited on occasion , and the Prince Regent , who later became George IV , was a regular visitor . George III 's seventh son , Prince Adolphus , became a family friend , lived at Gilwell for a while , and tutored their eldest son George . 
 Gilpin Gorst bought the estate in 1815 at public auction , and his son sold it to Thomas Usborne in 1824 . When London Bridge was replaced in 1826 , Usborne bought pieces of the stone balustrades , which date to 1209 , and erected them behind the White House around the Buffalo Lawn . The estate changed ownership more times , but these families did not maintain the property and it fell into disrepair by 1900 . Reverend <unk> , a local resident , bought the estate in 1911 and was the last owner prior to the Boy Scout Association , as it was then known . 
 = = = Scouting connection = = = 
 The estate 's condition declined more during the 1910s . William de Bois Maclaren was a publisher and Scout Commissioner from Rosneath , Dumbartonshire , Scotland . During a business trip to London , Maclaren was saddened to see that Scouts in the East End had no suitable outdoor area to conduct their activities . He contacted Lord Robert Baden @-@ Powell , who appointed P.B. Nevill to handle the matter . Nevill was Scout Commissioner of the East End . 
 On 20 November 1918 over dinner at Roland House , the Scout Hostel in Stepney , Maclaren agreed to donate £ 7 @,@ 000 to the project . Part of the agreement included narrowing the areas to look for suitable land to Hainault Forest and Epping Forest . Rover Scouts searched both without success , but then John <unk> , a young assistant Scoutmaster , suggested Gilwell Hall , a place he went bird @-@ watching . Nevill visited the estate and was impressed , though the buildings were in poor condition . The estate was for sale for £ 7 @,@ 000 , the price Maclaren had donated . The estate totaled 21 hectares ( 52 acres ) at the time . 
 The estate was purchased in early 1919 by Maclaren for the Boy Scout Association . Nevill first took his Rover Scouts to begin repairing the estate on Maundy Thursday , 17 April 1919 . On this visit , the Rovers slept in the gardener 's shed in the orchard because the ground was so wet they could not pitch tents . They called this shed " The <unk> " and though dilapidated , it still stands , as it is the site of the first Scout campsite at Gilwell Park . Maclaren was a frequent visitor to Gilwell Park and helped repair the buildings . His dedication was so great that he donated another £ 3 @,@ 000 . Maclaren 's interest had been in providing a campground , but Baden @-@ Powell envisioned a training centre for Scouters . 
 An official opening was planned for 19 July 1919 but it was delayed until Saturday , 26 July 1919 so that Scouts could participate in the Official Peace Festival commemorating the end of World War I. Invitations were changed by hand to save money . Significant remodeling and construction was done in the 1920s . Because of limited finances , few improvements were made during the Great Depression of the 1930s . 
 Baden @-@ Powell never lived at Gilwell Park but he often camped , lectured , taught courses , and attended meetings . He emphasized the importance of Scouters ' training at Gilwell Park for Scouting by taking it as the territorial designation in his peerage title of 1st Baron Baden @-@ Powell of Gilwell in 1929 when the barony was conferred upon him by the king . 
 = = = Origin of the axe and log totem = = = 
 The axe and log logo was conceived by the first Camp Chief , Francis Gidney , in the early 1920s to distinguish Gilwell Park from the Scout Headquarters . Gidney wanted to associate Gilwell Park with the outdoors and Scoutcraft rather than the business or administrative Headquarters offices . Scouters present at the original Wood Badge courses regularly saw axe blades masked for safety by being buried in a log . Seeing this , Gidney chose the axe and log as the totem of Gilwell Park . This logo came to be strongly associated with Wood Badge leader training and is still used on certificates , flags , and other program @-@ related items . 
 The symbol of the axe in the log is associated with feudalism after the invasion and conquest of England by William the Conqueror . In that era , property , including forests , were owned by the landed barons and knights . <unk> , bound to the land in a form of modified slavery , were forbidden to cut wood from trees in the forest , and only permitted to gather downed wood . A freeman who carried an axe in a nobleman 's forest demonstrated that he had earned the right by service . Symbolically , the grain of an axe handle must be " set square in the eye of the head . " The steel head must have the proper temper and be kept sharp . To be useful in the hands of a skilled freeman , an axe also needed to be well @-@ balanced , otherwise the handle might break , endangering its user . The axe represented skilled laborers who had proven themselves through service . Lastly , the axe in the wood reminds those who have completed Wood Badge that they have committed themselves to be an example of service and fealty . 
 = = = Wartime and later development = = = 
 The estate was requisitioned by the War Ministry from 1940 – 1945 as a local command , training , and ordnance centre . Little remains at the estate from World War II , except the hole created by a bomb dropped by the Luftwaffe . It was enlarged and is now used for swimming and canoeing . After the war , the Boy Scout Association bought adjoining land to increase the estate and protect it from rapidly approaching new developments . These areas are called The Quick , New Field , and Hilly Field . An additional purchase and a donation from South Africa in the early 1950s brought the estate to its present size . This began an era of expanding camping facilities for Scouts which lasted until the early 1960s . Training and sleeping facilities were added through the early 1970s . The Boy Scout Association was renamed The Scout Association in 1967 . 
 During the 1970s , two key and popular facilities were built : the Dorothy Hughes Pack Holiday Centre for Cub Scouts and the Colquhoun International Centre for training Scouters , originally called The International Hall of Friendship . In the 1980s extensive remodelling of the White House was done . In April 2001 , The Scout Association moved its program staff from London to Gilwell Park , where its training staff were already located . Extensive renovations were done to the White House and other buildings . With a budget of £ 20 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 and individual contributions as high as £ 500 @,@ 000 , improvements to programs and facilities have been ongoing since then in preparation for the 21st World Scout Jamboree in 2007 , which was the 100th anniversary of Scouting , hosted at nearby Hylands Park , Chelmsford , Essex with related activities also being held at Gilwell Park . Gilwell Park provides The Scout Association with over £ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 a year through conference fees , accommodation fees , and sales of materials .

 Captain Francis " Skipper " Gidney became the first Camp Chief in May 1919 and served until 1923 . He organized the first Wood Badge training , and contributed to setting up Gilwell Park as the Scouters ' training centre . The Gidney Cabin was built and named in his honour in 1929 to serve as a training centre . The second Camp Chief was John Skinner Wilson , who served from 1923 until 1939 . Wilson was Colonel with the British Indian Police when he became a Scout Leader in 1917 . In 1921 he traveled to Gilwell Park to take leader training , which led to his retirement from the Indian Police in 1922 to become a full @-@ time Scout Leader . He was honoured with the Bronze Wolf Award in 1937 , the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement . 
 R.F. " John " Thurman was a British Scout Leader who served as Camp Chief from 1943 until 1969 and was awarded the Bronze Wolf Award in 1959 . He was a strong promoter of Scout training and wrote books on the subject that were translated into other languages . The Thurman Memorial stands near The <unk> . Thurman was succeeded by John <unk> as Director of leader training . 
 Don Potter ( 1902 – 2004 ) was an English sculptor and wood carver who was a lifelong staff member at Gilwell Park , serving as a Gilwell Master Craftsman . Potter created wood carvings at Gilwell Park , including the Jim Green Gate , Gidney Cabin , the Leopard Gates , and totems he carved for the 1929 World Jamboree .

Leaders from all over the world receive automatic membership in 1st Gilwell Park Scout Group ( Gilwell Troop 1 ) on completion of the Wood Badge course . These leaders are henceforth called Wood Badgers or Gilwellians . Any location in which Wood Badgers meet is called Gilwell Field . The 1st Gilwell Park Scout Group meets every first weekend of September in Gilwell Park for the Gilwell Reunion . 
 The Training Ground , near the White House , is the hallowed ground of Gilwell Park as this is the world home of Wood Badge , the premier Scout leader training course . A large oak tree , the Gilwell Oak , separates the Training Ground from the Orchard .

 The White House also serves as a restaurant , training and conference centre . It was totally torn down once and has been renovated , remodelled , and expanded continuously over the years . The central portion has no foundations and the chimneys are made of Coade stone . It also displays original Scouting paintings by Ernest Stafford Carlos ( 1883 – 1917 ) ; the highlight of which is The Pathfinder .

 Branchet Lodge , or simply The Lodge , opened on 23 May 2003 on Branchet Field to replace old portable cabins . It should not be confused with another building also called The Lodge which was built in 1934 near the White House . Branchet Lodge is a single storey building that has central heating and sleeps up to 56 people in two separate wings with a single common kitchen and dining / meeting area . Each wing has its own bathing facilities . There are four single rooms for leaders , two rooms for disabled people that sleep two people each , and six rooms that sleep eight people each . The design incorporates skylights , natural lights , energy efficiency , and disabled access . It is constructed of stone , timber , copper , and a grass roof . At present , a second lodge is being constructed next door to the Branchet Lodge . This was to be called the Jack Petchey Lodge and was scheduled to open in September 2008 . Construction of a third lodge will begin in January 2009 . 
 Log cabins on the edge of Woodland Field sleep 8 and have bunk beds . Cooking is provided in a separate shelter or an open fire can be utilized . All of these can be rented by groups . The Storm Hut was a large hall @-@ type building for activities and games . It was moved to Gilwell Park from Wales by trucks . The Storm Hut was demolished in 2008 to make way for the upgrading of ' The Lid ' which now includes 2 classrooms , indoor climbing wall and high ropes elements . The Lid is a barn @-@ sized building that can not be rented , but is used for dances , exhibitions , and religious services . It is so named because the original building only had a roof , with no walls . 
 = = = Staff accommodation : <unk> and Gilwell Farm = = = 
 After the purchase of the original site in 1919 , the purchase of <unk> and adjoining land in 1945 is probably the next most important in Gilwell Park 's Scouting history because it allowed The Scout Association to close the original road and fully utilize Branchet Field . It was originally used for small retreats and conferences but is now used as staff accommodation . The Ministry of Education assisted in the purchase . 
 The Gilwell Farmhouse is believed to date from the early 18th century , making it the oldest original building at Gilwell Park . It is composed of two buildings that were joined together . There is a brick well head on the farm that is known as the Gil Well . A field adjoining the boundaries of Gilwell Park , known as Bill Oddie Field , affords dramatic views of the London skyline over Pole Hill , Chingford . The field was so @-@ named after employees of The Scout Association spotted TV ornithologist Bill Oddie recording a programme about circling birds of prey on the field in 2006 .

 The bronze bust of Baden @-@ Powell was presented by the Scouts of Mexico in 1968 after the Olympics . The Lime Walk formerly surrounded the main lawn area , but few of the lime trees survive . As originally planted by Margaret Chinnery , it would have formed a shady overhead cover to the path . 
 The Buffalo Lawn is so called because of the replica of the Boy Scouts of America ( BSA ) Silver Buffalo Award that was presented to the Boy Scout Association by the BSA in 1926 . This was to honour the Unknown Scout that helped William D. Boyce bring Scouting to the United States . The Buffalo Lawn is behind the White House . Located there is a signpost with the directions and distances to all the World Scout Jamborees from Gilwell Park . The Buffalo Statue was originally mounted on a large tree stump . The stump has been replaced by a brick pedestal . The inscription reads : 
 " To an Unknown Scout Whose Faithfulness in the Performance of the Daily Good Turn Brought the Scout Movement to the United States of America . " 
 A copy of a statue by R. Tait McKenzie called The Ideal Scout stands near The Lid . This is also known as The Boy Scout . The BSA donated the statue in 1966 . The original stands outside the headquarters of the Cradle of Liberty Council in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , and another copy outside the BSA headquarters in Irving , Texas . 
 The Buddhist Sala was donated to Gilwell Park in 1967 by the Boy Scouts of Thailand . The Buddha found inside was a gift from the Thai government and is over 1000 years old . Thai ambassadors to the United Kingdom often visit the sala , as it is their responsibility to care for it . Scouts from other countries , including Chile , Japan , Mexico , and New Zealand , have also donated gifts to Gilwell Park . 
 The caravan trailer , presented to Chief Scout Sir Robert Baden @-@ Powell , along with a new Rolls @-@ Royce car , during the 3rd World Scout Jamboree in 1929 is now on display .

 = Ottawa Senators = 
 The Ottawa Senators ( French : <unk> d <unk> ) are a professional ice hockey team based in Ottawa , Ontario , Canada . They are members of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . The Senators play their home games at the 18 @,@ 694 seat ( 20 @,@ 041 capacity ) Canadian Tire Centre which opened in 1996 . 
 Founded and established by Ottawa real estate developer Bruce Firestone , the team is the second NHL franchise to use the Ottawa Senators name . The original Ottawa Senators , founded in 1883 , had a famed history , winning 11 Stanley Cups and playing in the NHL from 1917 until 1934 . On December 6 , 1990 , after a two @-@ year public campaign by Firestone , the NHL awarded a new franchise , which began play in the 1992 – 93 season . The current team owner is Eugene Melnyk , and in 2014 , the club was valued by Forbes magazine at $ 400 million . 
 The team has had success , qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs in 15 of the past 19 seasons , winning four division titles , the Presidents ' Trophy in 2003 and appearing in the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals . The success has been reflected in attendance as the club has been regularly represented in the top half in attendance in the NHL . 
 = = History = = 
 Ottawa had been home to the original Senators , a founding NHL franchise and 11 @-@ time Stanley Cup champions . After the NHL expanded to the United States in the late 1920s , the original Senators ' eventual financial losses forced the franchise to move to St. Louis in 1934 operating as the Eagles while a Senators senior amateur team took over the Senators ' place in Ottawa . The NHL team was unsuccessful in St. Louis , and planned to return to Ottawa , but the NHL decided instead to suspend the franchise and transfer the players to other NHL teams . 
 Fifty @-@ four years later , after the NHL announced plans to expand , Ottawa real estate developer Bruce Firestone decided along with colleagues Cyril Leeder and Randy Sexton that Ottawa was now able to support an NHL franchise , and the group proceeded to put a bid together . His firm , Terrace Investments , did not have the liquid assets to finance the expansion fee and the team , but the group conceived a strategy to leverage a land development . In 1989 , after finding a suitable site on farmland just west of Ottawa in Kanata on which to construct a new arena , Terrace announced its intention to win a franchise and launched a successful " Bring Back the Senators " campaign to both woo the public and persuade the NHL that the city could support an NHL franchise . Public support was high and the group would secure over 11 @,@ 000 season ticket pledges . On December 12 , 1990 , the NHL approved a new franchise for Firestone 's group , to start play in the 1992 – 93 season . 
 = = = 1992 – 96 : First seasons = = = 
 The new team hired former NHL player Mel Bridgman , who had no previous NHL management experience , as its first general manager in 1992 . The team was initially interested in hiring former Jack Adams Award winner Brian Sutter as its first head coach , but Sutter came with a high price tag and was reluctant to be a part of an expansion team . When Sutter was eventually signed to coach the Boston Bruins , Ottawa signed Rick Bowness , the man Sutter replaced in Boston . The new Senators played their first game on October 8 , 1992 , in the Ottawa Civic Centre against the Montreal Canadiens with lots of pre @-@ game spectacle . The Senators defeated the Canadiens 5 – 3 in one of the few highlights that season . Following the initial excitement of the opening night victory , the club floundered badly and eventually tied the San Jose Sharks for the worst record in the league , winning only 10 games with 70 losses and four ties for 24 points , three points better than the NHL record for futility . The Senators had aimed low and considered the 1992 – 93 season a small success , as Firestone had set a goal for the season of not setting a new NHL record for fewest points in a season . The long term plan was to finish low in the standings for its first few years in order to secure high draft picks and eventually contend for the Stanley Cup . 
 Bridgman was fired after one season and Team President Randy Sexton took over the general manager duties . Firestone himself soon left the team and Rod Bryden emerged as the new owner . The strategy of aiming low and securing a high draft position did not change . The Senators finished last overall for the next three seasons . Although 1993 first overall draft choice Alexandre Daigle wound up being one of the greatest draft busts in NHL history , they chose Radek Bonk in 1994 , Bryan Berard ( traded for Wade Redden ) in 1995 , Chris Phillips in 1996 and Marian Hossa in 1997 , all of whom would become solid NHL players and formed a strong core of players in years to come . Alexei Yashin , the team 's first @-@ ever draft selection from 1992 , emerged as one of the NHL 's brightest young stars . The team traded many of their better veteran players of the era , including 1992 – 93 leading scorer Norm Maciver and fan favourites Mike <unk> and Bob <unk> in an effort to stockpile prospects and draft picks . 
 As the 1995 – 96 season began , star centre Alexei Yashin refused to honour his contract and did not play . In December , after three straight last @-@ place finishes and a team which was ridiculed throughout the league , fans began to grow restless waiting for the team 's long term plan to yield results , and arena attendance began to decline . Rick Bowness was fired in late 1995 and was replaced by the Prince Edward Island Senators ' head coach Dave Allison . Allison would fare no better than his predecessor , and the team would stumble to a 2 – 22 – 3 record under him . Sexton himself was fired and replaced by Pierre Gauthier , the former assistant GM of Anaheim . Before the end of January 1996 , Gauthier had resolved the team 's most pressing issues by settling star player Alexei Yashin 's contract dispute , and hiring the highly regarded Jacques Martin as head coach . While Ottawa finished last overall once again , the 1995 – 96 season ended with renewed optimism , due in part to the upgraded management and coaching , and also to the emergence of an unheralded rookie from Sweden named Daniel Alfredsson , who would win the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL Rookie of the Year in 1996 . 
 = = = 1996 – 2004 : Jacques Martin era = = = 
 Martin would impose a " strong defence first " philosophy that led to the team qualifying for the playoffs every season that he coached , but he was criticized for the team 's lack of success in the playoffs , notably losing four straight series against the provincial rival Toronto Maple Leafs . Martin outlasted several general managers and a change in ownership . 
 In 1996 – 97 , his first season , the club qualified for the playoffs in the last game of the season , and nearly defeated the Buffalo Sabres in the first round . In 1997 – 98 , the club finished with their first winning record and upset the heavily favoured New Jersey Devils to win their first playoff series . In 1998 – 99 , the Senators jumped from fourteenth overall in the previous season to third , with 103 points — the first 100 @-@ point season in club history , only to be swept in the first round . In 1999 – 2000 despite the holdout of team captain Alexei Yashin , Martin guided the team to the playoffs , only to lose to the Maple Leafs in the first Battle of Ontario series . Yashin returned for 2000 – 01 and the team improved to win their division and place second in the Eastern Conference . Yashin played poorly in another first round playoff loss and on the day of the 2001 NHL Entry Draft , he was traded to the New York Islanders in exchange for Zdeno Chara , Bill Muckalt and the second overall selection in the draft , which Ottawa used to select centre Jason Spezza . 
 The 2001 – 02 Senators regular season points total dropped , but in the playoffs , they upset the Philadelphia Flyers for the franchise 's second playoff series win . Yet the Sens would lose in game seven of the second round of the playoffs . Despite speculation that Martin would be fired , it was GM Marshall Johnston who left , retiring from the team , replaced by John Muckler , the Senators ' first with previous GM experience . 
 In 2002 – 03 off @-@ ice problems dominated the headlines , as the Senators filed for bankruptcy in mid @-@ season , but continued play after getting emergency financing . Despite the off @-@ ice problems , Ottawa had an outstanding season , placing first overall in the NHL to win the Presidents ' Trophy . In the playoffs , they came within one game of making it into the finals . Prior to the 2003 – 04 season , pharmaceutical billionaire Eugene Melnyk would purchase the club to bring financial stability . Martin would guide the team to another good regular season but again would lose in the first round of the playoffs , leading to Martin 's dismissal as management felt that a new coach was required for playoff success . 
 = = = 2004 – 16 : Bryan Murray era = = = 
 After the playoff loss , owner Melnyk promised that changes were coming and they came quickly . In June 2004 , Anaheim Ducks GM Bryan Murray of nearby <unk> , became head coach . That summer , the team also made substantial personnel changes , trading long @-@ time players Patrick Lalime and Radek Bonk , and signing free agent goaltender Dominik Hasek . The team would not be able to show its new lineup for a year , as the 2004 – 05 NHL lockout intervened and most players played in Europe or in the minors . In a final change , just before the 2005 – 06 season , the team traded long @-@ time player Marian Hossa for Dany Heatley . 
 The media predicted the Senators to be Stanley Cup contenders in 2005 – 06 , as they had a strong core of players returning , played in an up @-@ tempo style fitting the new rule changes and Hasek was expected to provide top @-@ notch goaltending . The team rushed out of the gate , winning 19 of the first 22 games , in the end winning 52 games and 113 points , placing first in the conference , and second overall . The newly formed ' CASH ' line of Alfredsson , Spezza and newly acquired Dany Heatley established itself as one of the league 's top offensive lines . Hasek played well until he was injured during the 2006 Winter Olympics , forcing the team to enter the playoffs with rookie netminder Ray Emery as their starter . Without Hasek , the club bowed out in a second round loss to the Buffalo Sabres . 
 = = = = 2006 – 07 : Trip to the Stanley Cup finals = = = = 
 In 2006 – 07 , the Senators reached the Stanley Cup Finals after qualifying for the playoffs in nine consecutive seasons . The Senators had a high turn @-@ over of personnel and the disappointment of 2006 to overcome and started the season poorly . Trade rumours swirled around Daniel Alfredsson for most of the last months of 2006 . The team lifted itself out of last place in the division to nearly catch the Buffalo Sabres by season 's end , placing fourth in the Eastern Conference . The team finished with 105 points , their fourth straight 100 @-@ point season and sixth in the last eight . In the playoffs , Ottawa continued its good play . Led by the ' CASH ' line , goaltender Ray Emery , and the strong defence of Chris Phillips and Anton Volchenkov , the club defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins , the second @-@ ranked New Jersey Devils and the top @-@ ranked Buffalo Sabres to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals . 
 First Stanley Cup finals in the capital in 80 years 
 The 2006 – 07 Senators thus became the first Ottawa team to be in the Stanley Cup final since 1927 and the city was swept up in the excitement . Businesses along all of the main streets posted large hand @-@ drawn " Go Sens Go " signs , residents put up large displays in front of their homes or decorated their cars . A large Ottawa Senators flag was draped on the City Hall , along with a large video screen showing the games . A six @-@ storey likeness of Daniel Alfredsson was hung on the Corel building . Rallies were held outside of City Hall , car rallies of decorated cars paraded through town and a section of downtown , dubbed the " Sens Mile , " was closed off to traffic during and after games for fans to congregate . 
 In the Final , the Senators now faced the Anaheim Ducks , considered a favourite since the start of the season , a team the Senators had last played in 2006 , and a team known for its strong defence . The Ducks won the first two games in Anaheim 3 – 2 and 1 – 0 . Returning home , the Senators won game three 5 – 3 , but lost game four 3 – 2 . The Ducks won game five 6 – 2 in Anaheim to clinch the series . The Ducks had played outstanding defence , shutting down the ' CASH ' line , forcing Murray to split up the line . The Ducks scored timely goals and Ducks ' goaltender Jean @-@ Sebastien Giguere out @-@ played Emery . 
 = = = = 2007 – 11 : A team in decline = = = = 
 In the off @-@ season after the Stanley Cup Final , Bryan Murray 's contract was expiring , while GM John Muckler had one season remaining , at which he was expected to retire . Murray , who had previously been at GM for other NHL clubs , was expected to take over the GM position , although no public timetable was given . Owner Melnyk decided to offer Muckler another position in the organization and give the GM position to Murray . Muckler declined the offer and was relieved from his position . Melnyk publicly justified the move , saying that he expected to lose Murray if his contract ran out . Murray then elevated John Paddock , the assistant coach , to head coach of the Senators . Under Paddock , the team came out to a record start to the 2007 – 08 season . However , team play declined to a .500 level and the team looked to be falling out of the playoffs . Paddock was fired by Murray , who took over coaching on an interim basis . The club managed to qualify for the playoffs by a tie @-@ breaker , but was swept in the first round of the playoffs to the Pittsburgh Penguins . In June , the club bought @-@ out goaltender Ray Emery , who had become notorious for off @-@ ice events in Ottawa and lateness to several team practices . 
 For 2008 – 09 , Murray hired Craig Hartsburg to coach the Senators . Under Hartsburg 's style , the Senators struggled and played under .500 . Uneven goaltending with Martin Gerber and Alex Auld meant the team played cautiously to protect the goaltender . Murray 's patience ran out in February 2009 with the team well out of playoff contention and Hartsburg was fired , although he had two years left on his contract , and the team also had Paddock under contract . Cory Clouston was elevated from the Binghamton coaching position . The team played above .500 under Clouston and rookie goaltender Brian Elliott , who had been promoted from Binghamton . Gerber was waived from the team at the trading deadline and the team traded for goaltender Pascal <unk> , although he would not play due to injury . The team failed to make the playoffs for the first time in 12 seasons . Auld would be traded in the off @-@ season to make room . Clouston 's coaching had caused a rift with top player Dany Heatley ( although unspecified " personal issues " were also noted by Heatley ) and after Clouston was given a contract to continue coaching , Heatley made a trade demand and was traded just before the start of the 2009 – 10 season . 
 In 2009 – 10 , the Senators were a .500 team until January , when the team went on a team @-@ record 11 @-@ game winning streak . The streak propelled the team to the top of the Northeast Division standings and a top @-@ three placing for the playoffs . The team was unable to hold off the Sabres for the division lead , but qualified for the playoffs in the fifth position . For the third season in four , the Senators played off against the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round . A highlight for the Senators was winning a triple @-@ overtime fifth game in Pittsburgh , but the team was unable to win a playoff game on home ice , losing the series in six games . 
 = = = = 2011 – present : Rebuilding = = = = 
 The Senators had a much poorer than expected 2010 – 2011 campaign , resulting in constant rumours of a shakeup right through until December . The rumours were heightened in January after the team went on a lengthy losing streak . January was a dismal month for the Senators , winning only one game all month . Media speculated on the imminent firing of Clouston , Murray or both . Owner <unk> cleared the air in an article in the January 22 , 2011 edition of the Ottawa Sun . Melnyk stated that he would not fire either Clouston or Murray , but that he had given up on this season and was in the process of developing a plan for the future . On Monday , January 24 , the Globe and Mail reported that the plan included hiring a new general manager before the June entry draft and that Murray would be retained as an advisor to the team . A decision on whether to retain Clouston would be made by the new general manager . The article by Roy MacGregor , a long @-@ time reporter of the Ottawa Senators , stated that former assistant coach Pierre McGuire had already been interviewed . Murray , in a press conference that day , stated that he wished to stay on as the team 's general manager . He also stated that Melnyk was allowing him to continue as general manager without restraint . Murray said that the players were now to be judged by their play until the February 28 trade deadline . Murray would attempt to move " a couple , at least " of the players for draft picks or prospects at that time if the Senators remained out of playoff contention . At the time of Murray 's comments the team was eight games under .500 and 14 points out of a playoff position after 49 games . 
 Murray started with the trading of Mike Fisher to the Nashville Predators in exchange for a first round pick in the 2011 draft . Fisher already had a home in Nashville with new wife Carrie Underwood . The trading of Fisher , a fan favourite in Ottawa , lead to a small anti @-@ Underwood backlash in the city with the banning of her songs from the play lists of some local radio stations . Murray next traded Chris Kelly , another veteran , to the Boston Bruins for a second round pick in the 2011 draft . A few days later , pending unrestricted free agent Jarkko Ruutu was sent to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for a sixth round pick in 2011 . A swap of goaltenders was made with the Colorado Avalanche which brought Craig Anderson to Ottawa in exchange for Brian Elliott . Both goalies were having sub @-@ par seasons prior to the trade . Under @-@ achieving forward Alex Kovalev was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for a seventh round draft pick . On trade deadline day , Ottawa picked up goaltender Curtis McElhinney on waivers and traded Chris Campoli with a seventh round pick to the Chicago Blackhawks for a second round pick and Ryan Potulny . Goaltender Anderson played very well down the stretch for Ottawa , and the team quickly signed the soon @-@ to @-@ be unrestricted free agent to a four @-@ year contract . After media speculation on the future of Murray within the organization , Murray was re @-@ signed as general manager on April 8 to a three @-@ year extension . On April 9 , Head Coach Cory Clouston and assistants Greg Carvel and Brad Lauer were dismissed from their positions . Murray said that the decision was made based on the fact that the team entered the season believing it was a contender , but finished with a 32 – 40 – 10 record . Former Detroit Red Wings ' assistant coach Paul MacLean was hired as Clouston 's replacement on June 14 , 2011 . 
 As the 2011 – 12 season began , many hockey writers and commentators were convinced that the Senators would finish at or near the bottom of the NHL standings . In the midst of rebuilding , the Ottawa lineup contained many rookies and inexperienced players . The team struggled out of the gate , losing five of their first six games before a reversal of fortunes saw them win six games in a row . In December 2011 , the team acquired forward Kyle Turris from the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for David <unk> and a draft pick . The team improved its play afterwards and moved into a playoff position before the All @-@ Star Game . For the first time in Senators ' history , the All @-@ Star Game was held in Ottawa , and it was considered a great success . Five Senators were voted in or named to the event , including Daniel Alfredsson , who was named captain of one team . The team continued its playoff push after the break . After starting goalie Craig Anderson injured his hand in a kitchen accident at home , the Senators called up Robin Lehner from Binghamton and acquired highly regarded goaltender Ben Bishop from the St. Louis Blues . While Anderson recovered , the team continued its solid play . On April 1 , 2012 , the Senators defeated the New York Islanders 5 – 1 , officially ensuring a playoff position . The team finished as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference , drawing a first round playoff matchup against the Conference champion New York Rangers . Ultimately , Ottawa lost the series in seven games . 
 The next season , Ottawa would be challenged to repeat the success they had in 2011 – 12 , due to long @-@ term injuries to key players such as Erik Karlsson , Jason Spezza , Milan Michalek and Craig Anderson . Despite these injuries , the Senators would finish seventh in the Eastern Conference and head coach Paul MacLean would go on to win the Jack Adams Award as the NHL 's coach of the year . Ottawa would play the second @-@ seeded Montreal Canadiens in the first round of the playoffs , eventually winning in five games , blowing out Montreal 6 – 1 in games three and five . The Senators would advance to play the top @-@ seeded Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round , this time losing in five games . During the off @-@ season , the Senators traded veteran defenceman Sergei Gonchar to the Dallas Stars for a sixth round pick in the 2013 draft . July 5 , 2013 , would be a day of mixed emotions for the city and fans , as long @-@ time captain Daniel Alfredsson signed a one @-@ year contract with the Detroit Red Wings , leaving Ottawa after 17 seasons with the Senators and 14 as captain . The signing shocked numerous fans across the city and many within the Senators organization . The day finished optimistically however , as Murray acquired star forward Bobby Ryan from the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for forwards Jakob Silfverberg , Stefan <unk> and a first round pick in the 2014 draft . The hope was that Ryan would be the guy to play on the top line with Jason Spezza after Alfredsson 's departure . Murray would also sign free agent forward Clarke MacArthur to a two @-@ year contract that same day and would sign free agent defenceman Joe Corvo to a one @-@ year contract three days later on July 8 , 2013 . 
 For the 2013 – 14 NHL season , the league realigned and Ottawa was assigned to the new Atlantic Division along with the rest of the old Northeast Division , with the additions of the Columbus Blue Jackets and Detroit Red Wings , formerly of the Western Conference . The re @-@ alignment brought increased competition to qualify for the playoffs , as there were now 16 teams in the Eastern Conference fighting for eight playoff spots . The season began with a changing of leadership , as on September 14 , 2013 , the Ottawa Senators named Jason Spezza their eighth captain in franchise history . While new addition Clarke MacArthur had a career year , Ryan and Spezza struggled to find chemistry , and Ryan was moved to a line with MacArthur and Kyle Turris , where he fared much better . Bobby Ryan also ran into injury problems during the season , and while there were times where Joe Corvo played solidly , he eventually lost his place in the lineup . The club struggled on defence , as shots and goals against numbers increased from the previous season . The club was a sub .500 team much of the season , or only a few games above and never was in a playoff position all season . At the trade deadline , Murray traded for flashy right winger Ales Hemsky from the Edmonton Oilers , quickly finding success on a line with Spezza and Michalek . The club , however , was eliminated from playoff contention in the last week of the season . At the end of the season , the club failed to come to terms on a new contract with Hemsky and captain Jason Spezza requested a trade out of Ottawa . At the 2014 NHL Entry Draft , a potential trade to the Nashville Predators was negotiated by Murray but rejected by Spezza , as the Predators were one of the teams on his limited no @-@ trade list . A deal with the Dallas Stars was eventually reached , and Spezza was sent , along with Ludwig Karlsson , in exchange for Alex Chiasson , Nick Paul , Alex Guptill and a 2015 second @-@ round pick . During the off @-@ season , the club signed free agent forward David <unk> to a two @-@ year , $ 6 million contract . 
 At the beginning of the 2014 – 15 season , defenceman Erik Karlsson was named the franchise 's ninth captain , with the club also re @-@ signing Bobby Ryan to a seven @-@ year extension . After firing head coach Paul MacLean after 27 games with an 11 @-@ 11 @-@ 5 record and replacing him with Dave Cameron , the Senators would win 32 of their last 55 games . Goaltender Andrew Hammond would compile a record of 20 @-@ 1 @-@ 2 , a goals against average of 1 @.@ 79 , and a save percentage of <unk> to get the team back into playoff position . The Senators later became the first team in modern NHL history to overcome a 14 @-@ point deficit at any juncture of the season to qualify for the playoffs . However , the Senators lost to the Canadiens in six games in the first round of the playoffs . 
 During the 2014 – 15 season , it was announced that Murray had cancer . Taking regular treatment , Murray chose to stay on as GM through the 2015 – 16 season . Despite posting the best record of any Canadian team in the league , the Senators failed to make the playoffs in what was considered a disappointing season ( all seven Canadian teams missed the playoffs ) . Murray made one ' blockbuster ' 11 @-@ player trade that brought Toronto Maple Leafs ' captain Dion Phaneuf to the Senators before the trade deadline with the Senators outside of a playoff position , but the team could not put together another run and finished with 85 points for fifth in the division . 
 = = = 2016 – present = = = 
 On April 10 , 2016 , the day after the final game of the 2015 – 16 season , Murray announced his resignation as manager and that he would continue in an advisory role with the club . Assistant general manager Pierre Dorion was elevated to the general manager position . On April 12 , 2016 , the Senators fired head coach Dave Cameron . On May 8 , 2016 , the Senators hired former Tampa Bay Lightning head coach Guy Boucher as their new head coach . On the following day , Marc Crawford was announced as associate coach . In June , 2016 , the Senators hired Rob Cookson as an assistant coach , who had worked with both Boucher and Crawford in Switzerland , and Pierre Groulx as a goaltending coach .

 The new Senators ' first home arena was the Ottawa Civic Centre , located on Bank Street , where they played from the 1992 @-@ 93 season to January of the 1995 @-@ 96 season . They played their first home game on October 8 , 1992 against the Montreal Canadiens with lots of pre @-@ game spectacle . The Senators would defeat the Canadiens 5 – 3 in one of few highlights that season . Montreal would eventually finish the season as Stanley Cup champions . Following the initial excitement of the opening night victory , the club floundered badly and would eventually tie with the San Jose Sharks for the worst record in the league , finishing with only 10 wins , 70 losses and 4 ties for 24 points , three points better than the NHL record for futility .

 As part of its bid to land a NHL franchise for Ottawa , Terrace Corporation unveiled the original proposal for the arena development at a press conference in September 1989 . The proposal included a hotel and 20 @,@ 500 seat arena , named The Palladium on 100 acres ( 0 @.@ 40 km2 ) , surrounded by a 500 @-@ acre ( 2 @.@ 0 km2 ) mini @-@ city , named " West Terrace . " The site itself , 600 acres ( 2 @.@ 4 km2 ) of farmland , on the western border of Kanata , had been acquired in May 1989 by Terrace . Rezoning approval was granted by the Board on August 28 , 1991 , with conditions . The conditions imposed by the board included a scaling down of the arena to 18 @,@ 500 seats , a moratorium on development outside the initial 100 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 40 km2 ) arena site , and that the cost of the highway interchange with highway 417 be paid by Terrace . A two @-@ year period was used seeking financing for the site and interchange by Terrace Corporation . The corporation received a $ 6 million grant from the federal government , but needed to borrow to pay for the rest of the costs of construction . A ground @-@ breaking ceremony was held in June 1992 but actual construction did not start until July 7 , 1994 . Actual construction took 18 months , finishing in January 1996 . 
 The newly built Palladium opened on January 15 , 1996 with a concert by Canadian rocker Bryan Adams . The Senators played their first game in their new arena two days later , falling 3 @-@ 0 to the Montreal Canadiens . On February 17 , 1996 , the name ' Palladium ' was changed to the ' Corel Centre ' when Corel Corporation , an Ottawa software company , signed a 10 @-@ year deal for the naming rights . 
 When mortgage holder Covanta Energy ( the former Ogden Entertainment ) went into receivership in 2001 , Terrace was expected to pay off the entire debt . The ownership was not able to refinance the arena , eventually leading Terrace itself to declare bankruptcy in 2003 . However , on August 26 , 2003 , billionaire businessman Eugene Melnyk finalized the purchase of the Senators and the arena . The arena and club became solely owned by Melnyk through a new company , Capital Sports Properties . 
 In 2004 , the ownership applied to expand its seating . In December 2004 , the City of Ottawa amended its by @-@ laws and in 2005 , the venue was allowed to increase its seating capacity to 19 @,@ 153 and total attendance capacity to 20 @,@ 500 when including standing room . 
 On January 19 , 2006 , the arena became known as ' Scotiabank Place ' after reaching a new 15 @-@ year naming agreement with Canadian bank Scotiabank on January 11 , 2006 . Scotiabank had been an advertising partner with the club for several years and took over the naming after Corel declined to renew its naming agreement with the Senators , but continued as an advertising sponsor . 
 On June 18 , 2013 , the Ottawa Senators announced a new marketing agreement with Canadian Tire , and as a result , the arena was renamed the Canadian Tire Centre on July 1 , 2013 .

 The team colours are red , black and white , with added trim of gold . The team 's away jersey is mostly white with red and black trim , while the home jersey is red , with white and black trim . The club logo is officially the head of a Roman general , a member of the Senate of the Roman Republic , projecting from a gold circle . The original , unveiled on May 23 , 1991 , described the general as a " centurion figure , strong and prominent " according to its designer , Tony Milchard . 
 The current jersey design was unveiled on August 22 , 2007 , in conjunction with the league @-@ wide adoption of the Rbk EDGE jerseys by Reebok for the 2007 – 08 season . The jersey incorporates the original Senators ' ' O ' logo as a shoulder patch . At the same time , the team updated its logos , and switched their usage . The primary logo , which according to team owner Eugene Melnyk , " represents strength and determination " is an update of the old secondary logo . The old primary logo has become the team 's secondary logo and only appears on Senators ' merchandise . 
 In 2011 , the Senators introduced their current third jersey design . Mostly black , the jersey incorporated horizontal striping intended to be reminiscent of the original Senators ' ' barber @-@ pole ' designs . Shield @-@ type patches were added to the shoulders . The design of the shield @-@ type patches was intended to be similar to the shield patches that the original Senators added to their jerseys after each Stanley Cup championship win . The patches spell the team name , one in English , and one in French . The design was a collaborative effort between the Senators and a fan in Gatineau , Quebec who had been circulating a version of it on the internet since 2009 .

 At many home games the fans are entertained both outside and inside Canadian Tire Centre with a myriad of talent – live music , rock bands , giveaways and promotions . The live music includes the traditional Scottish music of the ' Sons of Scotland Pipe Band ' of Ottawa along with highland dancers .

 The fans of the Senators are known as the Sens Army . Like most hockey fanatics , they are known to dress up for games ; some in Roman legionary clothing . For the 2006 – 2007 playoff run , more fans than ever before would wear red , and fan activities included ' Red Rallies ' of decorated cars , fan rallies at Ottawa City Hall Plaza and the ' Sens Mile ' along Elgin Street where fans would congregate . 
 = = = = Sens Mile = = = = 
 Much like the Red Mile in Calgary during the Flames ' 2004 cup run and the Copper Kilometer in Edmonton during the Oilers ' 2006 cup run , Ottawa Senators fans took to the streets to celebrate their team 's success during the 2006 – 07 playoffs . The idea to have a ' Sens Mile ' on the downtown Elgin Street , a street with numerous restaurants and pubs , began as a grassroots campaign on Facebook by Ottawa residents before Game 4 of the Ottawa @-@ Buffalo Eastern Conference Final series . After the Game 5 win , Ottawa residents closed the street to traffic for a spontaneous celebration . The City of Ottawa then closed Elgin Street for each game of the Final . 
 = = Broadcasting = = 
 Ottawa Senators games are broadcast locally in both the French and English languages . As of the 2014 @-@ 15 season , regional television rights to the Senators ' regular season games not broadcast nationally by Sportsnet , TVA Sports , or Hockey Night in Canada are owned by Bell Media under a 12 @-@ year contract , with games airing in English on <unk> , and in French on RDS .

Nicolas St. Pierre provides play @-@ by @-@ play , with Alain <unk> as colour commentator . 
 Sportsnet East held English regional rights to the Sens prior to the 2014 @-@ 15 season . In April 2014 , Dean Brown , who had called play @-@ by @-@ play for Senators games the team 's inception , stated that it was " extremely unlikely " that he would move to TSN and continue his role .

 = John R. Tunis = 
 John Roberts Tunis ( December 7 , 1889 – February 4 , 1975 ) , " the ' inventor ' of the modern sports story " , was an American writer and broadcaster . Known for his juvenile sports novels , Tunis also wrote short stories and non @-@ fiction , including a weekly sports column for the The New Yorker magazine . As a commentator Tunis was part of the first trans @-@ Atlantic sports cast and the first broadcast of the Wimbledon Tennis Tournament to the United States . 
 After graduating from Harvard and serving in the Army during World War I , Tunis began his writing career freelancing for American sports magazines while playing tennis in the Rivera . For the next two decades he wrote short stories and articles about sports and education for magazines including Reader 's Digest , The Saturday Evening Post and Esquire . Tunis ' work often protested the increasing professionalization of sports in America . He believed that amateur participation in sports taught values important for good citizenship like perseverance , fair play and equality , and that the emphasis on professional sports was turning America into a country of spectators . His sports books also tackled current social issues such as antisemitism and racial equality . 
 Though Tunis never considered himself a children 's writer , all but one of his twenty @-@ four books were published for juveniles ; their success helped create the juvenile fiction book market in the 1940s . Books like Iron Duke ( 1938 ) , All American ( 1942 ) and Keystone Kids ( 1943 ) were well received by readers and critics . Iron Duke received the New York Herald Tribune Spring Book Festival Award for best juvenile novel and was named a The Horn Book Magazine Best Book . The Child Study Association of America gave its Golden Scroll Award to Keystone Kids . 
 Tunis ' eight @-@ book baseball series about the Brooklyn Dodgers began with The Kid from Tomkinsville , a book often cited by sports writers and commentators as inspiring childhood reading . Phillip Roth used The Kid from Tomkinsville and its main character Roy Tucker in his book American Pastoral . It is also considered an influence for Bernard Malamud 's The Natural and Mark Harris ' Bang the Drum Slowly . 
 = = Early years = = 
 John Roberts Tunis was born December 7 , 1889 to John Arthur and Caroline Greene Roberts Tunis , a teacher , in Boston , Massachusetts . John Arthur came from a well @-@ to @-@ do family , which he upset by leaving the Episcopalian church to become a Unitarian minister . His family disowned him when he married Caroline , the daughter of a waiter . When Tunis was seven and his brother Robert five their father died of Bright 's disease ; no one from the Tunis side of the family attended the funeral . After his death their mother taught at Brearley School for girls in Manhattan , later moving the family to Cambridge , Massachusetts , where she ran a boarding house . 
 Tunis ' maternal grandfather encouraged the brothers to take an interest in baseball . Two of young Tunis ' heroes were Boston Nationals ' baseball players Billy Hamilton and Fred Tenney . At age fourteen Tunis and his brother , too poor to pay the admission price , managed to watch a Davis Cup tennis match by climbing on top of a brewery wagon outside the courts . Tunis played tennis at Cambridge Latin School , then followed in his father 's footsteps to Harvard where he competed in tennis and ran track . He graduated from Harvard with a B. A. in 1911 , then got a job in a Newburyport , Massachusetts , cotton mill . Tunis became an officer in the U.S. Army , serving in France during World War I. On February 19 , 1918 , Tunis married Lucy Rogers in Cambridge , Massachusetts . They did not have any children .

 = = = Freelance writing and <unk> = = = 
 In 1921 the couple went to Europe where Tunis freelanced as a sports writer for American publications and played in some tennis tournaments on the Riviera , including a match against King Gustaf V of Sweden , who was 70 at the time . Tunis also played a doubles match against the French women 's champion Suzanne Lenglen . Returning to the U.S. at the end of the summer , he dropped in on former Harvard classmate Lawrence Winship , the Sunday editor of The Boston Globe . When Winship learned that Tunis actually knew the flamboyant Lenglen , he insisted he write an article about her for the Globe before leaving the building . The pressure of that deadline caused him such anxiety that after half an hour of struggle he went to the building 's fire escape , " leaned over the railing , and threw up . I 'll never forget it . I wiped my face with copy paper . But I did the story . " Between 1920 and 1940 Tunis freelanced for a number of major magazines , including Reader 's Digest , Harper 's , Atlantic Monthly , Collier 's , The Saturday Evening Post and Esquire , writing primarily on two topics : sports and education . He also covered sports for the New York Evening Post from 1925 to 1932 and had a weekly column in The New Yorker . According to Norman Cousins in Writing for Love or Money , Tunis was known for producing " fact @-@ packed articles based upon research " . Working six days a week and taking the seventh to play tennis , Tunis published over 2 @,@ 000 articles and short stories , becoming one <unk> 's premier sportswriters . 
 At the same time , Tunis worked as a sport announcer , including commentating for tennis events for NBC . By 1927 The Harvard Crimson felt comfortable calling him " a world 's authority on tennis " . He was part of the first trans @-@ Atlantic sports broadcast , a Davis Cup match from France in 1932 . In 1934 Tunis announced the first broadcast of the Wimbledon Tennis Tournament to a U.S. audience . According to Anita Silvey in Children 's Books and Their Creators , between broadcasting and journalism Tunis became a " household name " . 
 = = = Novels and sports criticism = = = 
 Tunis ' first novel , American Girl , appeared in 1930 . An unflattering and thinly veiled fictionalization of tennis star Helen Wills Moody , it became the basis for the 1951 movie Hard , Fast and Beautiful . It turned out to be the only one of Tunis ' novels to be published for adults . 
 In 1936 , on the 25th anniversary of his graduation from Harvard , Tunis wrote Was College <unk> ? , a condemnation of the Ivy League school and of his classmates that became a best seller . Jerome Holtzman , in No Cheering in the Press Box , calls it " a searing assault on Harvard traditions " . Throughout his career he continued to write about education , including the chapter " New <unk> on the Campus " for Democracy 's Challenge to Education , and " Education and Ethics " for the Journal of Higher Education . 
 The 1920 @-@ 1930s have been called the Golden Age of Sports , and Tunis was right in the middle of much of it as a commentator , writer , and athlete , but he often criticized what he saw . He disliked the way the media was covering sports and its players . In the 1920s some sports promoters bribed newspapers for favorable coverage , and he felt the media was glorifying the business and ignoring its problems . Tunis also believed that high salaries would destroy the pleasure and benefits sports brought the everyday player . His essay " The Great God Football " appeared in Harper 's Magazine in 1928 , attacking what he saw as the increasing commercialization of college football . The article became the center of a continuing controversy . A 2010 The Texas Observer cover story , titled The Golden Football : The University of Texas ’ Bad Example , opens with a two @-@ paragraph reference to Tunis ' article , and concludes by referring the reader back to Tunis ' 1928 description of college football as a " first @-@ class octopus strangling the legitimate pursuits of educational institutions . " " Who Owns Football ? " appeared in Sports Story Magazine in 1931 , in 2012 John Dinan 's Sports in the Pulp Magazines called it " timeless " . 
 According to Ryan K. Anderson in Upon Further Review : Sports in American Literature , " By the 1940s , Tunis enjoyed a career based on the practice of criticizing those aspects of American culture that others took lightly " . " He felt that the more organized sports became , the more they led to the glorification of athletes , turning the United States into a country of spectators . As much as he loved sports , his writings often tried to show the need for balance in personal and national life . At one point he declared " Sports is the great opium of the people . It has become an addiction . It has made them forget more important things . "

 As the Depression took its toll on magazine finances , Tunis began working on another novel , Iron Duke , the story of a small @-@ town Iowa football star who struggles to fit in with his elite classmates at Harvard , and eventually finds strength through success as a runner . He wrote the book for adults , but Alfred Harcourt wanted to publish and market it for juveniles . This initially dismayed Tunis , partly because at that time the separate field of young @-@ adult fiction did not exist , and Tunis did not consider himself a children 's writer . He eventually agreed and in 1938 Harcourt , Brace published Iron Duke as a children 's book . The novel won the New York Herald Tribune Spring Book Festival Award for best juvenile novel and opened a new arena for Tunis . Tunis ' success with these books made him one of a handful of writers who helped establish the young @-@ adult market as a separate field . Kirkus Reviews gave Iron Duke a starred review among " books of remarkable merit " , its reviewer calling it " One of the best modern college stories I have read " . It was also named a The Horn Book Magazine Fanfare Best Book for 1938 . The following year Harcourt released the sequel , The Duke Decides , which covers Duke 's senior year at Harvard . Duke 's participation as part of the U.S. Olympic team in Germany allowed Tunis to highlight the growing totalitarianism in Europe . Iron Duke was Tunis ' best selling novel and remains his most well known work . 
 In 1940 Tunis received $ 200 from his publisher to visit the Dodgers ' spring training camp in Clearwater , Florida . He then began work on his first baseball novel . The Kid from Tomkinsville became the first in a series of eight books about the Brooklyn Dodgers . In it , Tunis introduced rookie pitcher Roy Tucker and his teammates : " Bones " Hathaway , " Razzle " Nugent and " Fat Stuff " Foster . Tunis says in a note at the beginning of the book that " all the characters in this book were drawn from real life . " Though his papers only list Tucker as " Number 36 " , they do say that , among others , " Gabby " Gus was based on Leo Durocher and Tucker 's Rabbi was inspired by Luke Sewell . Kirkus gave it another starred review , saying it " struck a new note " . Tucker 's story continues in 1941 's World Series . 
 The next year Tunis took a break from baseball stories to release two novels that again received starred reviews from Kirkus . Million Miler , based on the life of TWA and U.S. Air Corps pilot Jack Zimmerman , was overshadowed by his other 1942 release , All American , called by Simon <unk> in The English Journal " the most superb novel produced in its genre " . All American centers on football star Ronald Perry , who in protest over anti @-@ Semitic activity and guilt for his part in it , leaves his prep school to play football for the local public high school , which does not exactly welcome him . Perry ultimately adjusts and becomes accepted , leading his new team to a postseason playoff . However , the team is invited only if they agree not to bring their one African @-@ American player . Initially Perry is the only one who objects to this , but his refusal eventually stirs other students and parents to protest as well . Kirkus Reviews said of Tunis ' only football novel , " This is one of the BIG books of the Fall , and should not be pigeonholed for junior reading . " It further praised the book for illustrating " the whole rounded picture of race and color problems facing young and old today " . Sixty @-@ eight years later D.G. Myers , in " About the <unk> Sport " , his 2010 article for Commentary magazine , decries the lack of good novels about football , calling All American " the best of a bad harvest ... No one is better at describing the action on the field " , though Myers warns that " readers will find Tunis dated " . In a chapter titled " John R. Tunis : The Best of the Best " , Michelle Nolan 's 2010 book Ball Tales praises All American as " a perceptive novel of character , of morals , and it 's far ahead of its time " . Just how ahead of its time may be seen when Nolan points out that Hans <unk> 's illustrations " may be the first of an African American football player in action in an American sports novel . " 
 With 1943 's Keystone Kids , Tunis returned to his beloved Dodgers , again addressing anti @-@ Semitism , this time as manager and shortstop Spike Russell struggles to get his brother , and the rest of the team , to accept star catcher Jocko Klein . Keystone Kids received the Child Study Association of America Golden Scroll Award as the " most challenging children 's book of the year " . 
 The next Dodgers novel , Rookie of the Year , appeared in 1944 . Manager Russell struggles with an arrogant new pitcher . The same year Yea ! Wildcats ! took Tunis , and the reader , to Indiana for high school basketball tournament season . Tunis actually visited Indiana for his research , living with a key player and his family during tournament season . Called by Ball Tales " Hoosiers four decades before Hoosiers " , the entire Varsity team is cut over a discipline infraction , and coach Don Henderson must resist the pressures of parents and community to win at all costs . Kirkus says Yea ! Wildcats ! was " a plea for clean sport – sport for sports sake , not for gamblers – and for taking money and politics out of school sport . " Coach Henderson returned the next year in A City for Lincoln , working with juvenile delinquents and eventually running for mayor . In both these books Tunis returns to a favorite theme noted by Ryan K. Anderson in his survey of Tunis ' World War II era writings ; that parents , administrators , gamblers and other adult fans " injected improper values " into amateur sports . In one speech Coach Henderson says " I don 't really believe there are any bad kids , <unk> not many . One or two , one or two perhaps ... but there 's plenty of bad parents . " 
 World War II was on Tunis ' mind while he wrote . In 1946 's The Kid Comes Back he takes Roy Tucker into occupied France , where a plane crash injures Tucker 's back . Returning to the Dodgers , Tucker struggles to overcome his injury and cope with being the old man on the team . He becomes the voice of Tunis , emphasizing team spirit over individual glory , when he aids the rookie trying to replace him , saying " What helps you helps all " . 
 Tunis ' sixth Dodgers novel , Highpockets , came out in 1948 . The title is the nickname for Cecil McDade , the talented rookie outfielder whose arrogance causes problems on and off the field . The novel won the Boy Scouts of America 's junior book award for 1949 . Son of the Valley , which also came out that year , is one of Tunis ' few non @-@ sports related novels , dramatizing the struggle for acceptance of the Tennessee Valley Authority among rural families displaced by a new dam . A portion of it was excerpted as " Johnny 's Experiment " in Told Under <unk> Skies . 1949 saw the publication of his next @-@ to @-@ last book about the Dodgers . Young Razzle is the story of veteran pitcher Razzle Nugent and his estranged rookie son , who reconcile during Razzle 's final season of baseball . Ball Tales calls it " Tunis ' most entertaining , if not profound , story . " 
 = = = 1950s = = = 
 Tunis ' next novel , Go Team Go , set in 1954 , returns to Indiana basketball . Again a coach risks the support of fans by cutting players , including the team star . The hero , Tom Williams , comes to see that his coach was right , and gets his father 's respect – and the girl – by helping the new team move forward . Buddy and the Old Pro is a 1955 novel about Pop Warner football . Tunis disliked organized sports for young children , saying " I 've always believed Little League is harmful to the extreme . It 's for the parents , and that 's what I object to ... I don 't like the idea of having little boys playing in front of their parents and friends . Little boys should be playing their sports by themselves . " In what Michelle Nolan in Ball Tales calls a " remarkable book " , Tunis uses his only non @-@ Dodgers baseball novel to emphasize a favorite theme when the young protagonist admits to his father " it 's better to lose , much as it hurts , than to play dirty " . 
 Schoolboy Johnson closed out the decade in 1959 . Roy Tucker and teammate Speedy Mason are cut from the Dodgers and end up together on a Triple @-@ AAA team . When both men get called back , the older and wiser players teach young Schoolboy the meaning of the game . " Baseball is a test of character , how you react under pressure " . Schoolboy Johnson ended Tunis ' Dodgers series , and it was his last true sports novel until 1973 's Grand National . 
 = = = 1960s = = = 
 Tunis wrote only two novels in the 1960s , both set during World War II . Silence over Dunkerque appeared in 1962 . It tells the story of the evacuation of Dunkerque during World War II . The book received a starred review from Kirkus . Gail Murray in Boyhood in America called it " moving " and Children Experience Literature said it was a " grimly realistic picture of warfare and its effect on both soldiers and civilians " . According to the International Reading Association , while reading it " children may be helped to understand that history is always someone 's interpretation ... For in this story the author had the courage to admit that our men were sometimes less than brave in their desperate struggle to survive " . 
 Tunis ' autobiography , A Measure of Independence , appeared in 1964 . Ball Tales makes it " Highly recommended for anyone who aspires to be , or remain , a freelance writer " . It barely mentions any of Tunis ' sports books , concentrating instead on his magazine career . According to The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography , some critics consider A Measure of Independence " a powerful dramatic novel written under the guise of an autobiography " . 
 His Enemy , His Friend appeared in 1967 . Tunis considered this second World War II book to be his best work . Horn Book agreed , calling it " his finest novel ... With its irony and eloquence the story not only shows the futility of war but carries the central character to the heights of the protagonist in a Greek tragedy " . Opening with an Author 's Note stating " This is a book about the conscience of a man " , the story tells of a German sergeant , a convicted war criminal remembered by the French as the Butcher of Nogent @-@ Plage , who returns to the area twenty years after the war 's end , to play soccer . Literature IS ... Collected Essays says the novel " lays bare man 's age @-@ old confusion between his inner conscience and the demands of his culture " .

 In 1973 Tunis ' final sports novel appeared . Boys ' Life published an excerpt from Grand National and gave the book a positive review , calling it " exciting " . Kirkus , however , found it " sentimental " and " tepid " . The publication of Grand National brought Tunis ' total number of juvenile novels to twenty @-@ three . 
 John R. Tunis , according to D. G. Myers " perhaps the greatest sports novelist of all time " , died on February 4 , 1975 , in Boston , Massachusetts , survived by his wife , Lucy Rogers . His papers are held at Boston University . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Leonard Marcus in <unk> of Make @-@ Believe : Idealists , Entrepreneurs , and the Shaping of American Children 's Literature , says " Tunis 's books were never only about sports " , noting " the author 's determination to offer his readers basic lessons about good citizenship and fair play , and a chance to reflect on such rarely discussed social issues as racial equality and anti @-@ Semitism " . A doctoral study at Oklahoma State University in 1996 analyzed all of Tunis ' juvenile sports books . The predominant value found both in the books and their main characters was Courtesy / Fairness / Respect . The second most identified value was Compassion / Kindness . The study found that " the values are not portrayed <unk> , as part of lessons , but rather as a natural part of the stories " . In his book What Would Frank <unk> Do ? , Ryan Anderson also pointed out the recurring theme of fairness and sportsmanship over winning in both Tunis ' fiction and non @-@ fiction , saying " The common thread winding through all his writing became his dismay over the nation 's tendency to value winning above common decency . " In turning from primarily writing non @-@ fiction for adults to juvenile fiction Tunis did not abandon his emphasis on values over victory , but it did give him an audience that seemed more willing to listen . 
 Rather than emphasize winning , Tunis believed that values like hard work and perseverance could be taught through sports . The 1951 football brochure for the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology Athletic Scholarship committee cites Tunis , saying " The athletic department would like to feel that the existing program can do for the engineer what John Tunis had in mind when he said , ' The deep objective of games really is to train one ’ s reflex of purpose to develop a habit of keeping steadily at something you want until it is done . ' " Many of Tunis ' biggest heroes find themselves eventually brought low , like Roy Tucker in The Kid Comes Back , whose wartime service injury may have destroyed his career , or Iron Duke Jim Wellington at Harvard , ostracized and lonely , who perseveres by running track . The real victory is in the character 's refusal to give up against long odds . " My heroes are the losers " he once said . " All my books have been in that vein . Every book I 've ever written . " In the Introduction to The Kid from Tomkinsville , Bruce Brooks writes " for Tunis a win was what happened at the ballpark some of the time , usually just before a loss . It didn 't make you a good person , anymore than a loss made you a jerk . " 
 Tunis did not exclude the social issues of the times from his writing . In 1936 Foreign Affairs published " The Dictators Discover Sport " , about Hitler , Mussolini and their use of sports to influence , exploit and control their youth . Tunis also took on issues closer to home . He believed in the concept of " Democratic Sport " , that games open to any person " regardless of ethnicity , class , or skill " promoted the values America needed , and he used his stories to demonstrate those values , taking racism head on . According to the Child Study Association of America , in Keystone Kids " the issue of anti @-@ Semitism in American democracy is squarely faced and courageously met " . The 1942 Northwestern University radio program " Of Men and Books " featured All American in its episode titled " Children 's Books and American Unity " . 
 In 1945 writer and reviewer Howard Pease wrote : " Only at infrequent intervals do you find a story intimately related to this modern world , a story that takes up a modern problem and thinks it through without evasion ... of our hundreds of authors , I can name only three who are doing anything to fill this void in children 's reading . These three authors — may someone present each of them with a laurel wreath — are Doris Gates , John R. Tunis , and Florence <unk> Means . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 By the 1970s Tunis felt his message had been ignored or misunderstood by most Americans , saying " Nobody has paid attention ... There was a time when I expected to do some good . But that was a long while ago . " This may seem surprising considering that his New York Times obituary referred to him as a man who " helped educate a whole generation of Americans " . Perhaps seen in light of Tunis ' distrust of professional athletics , it can be understood . Though he may have felt his message against the commercialization of sports was ignored , there are those who cite Tunis as having made a lasting impact in publishing and to them personally and professionally . 
 In literature Tunis ' contributions have sometimes been direct . His baseball books , especially The Kid from Tomkinsville , have been cited as one source of inspiration for Bernard Malamud 's book The Natural , about baseball star Roy Hobbs . Among other similarities , both Hobbs and Tucker started as pitchers but , thanks to accidents , ended up as outfielders and power @-@ hitters . It has been suggested by Michele Schiavone in her study of Tunis ' influence on Malamud and Roth that , as an early fan of the Dodgers , Malamud was familiar with Tunis ' books and borrowed from them , " consciously or not " . Bruce Brooks ' introduction to the 1987 edition of The Kid from Tomkinsville says that Tunis " obviously " inspired Mark Harris , author of Bang the Drum Slowly . And in what D. G. Myers in Best Baseball Books Ever called " one of the best pieces of ( literary ) criticism ever written " , The Kid from Tomkinsville is referenced by Nathan Zuckerman , the main character in Philip Roth 's novel American Pastoral . For Zuckerman , Tunis ' book and pitcher Roy Tucker become what Schiavone called " a template for Zuckerman 's view of the Swede " , and his realization of the " tragic underside to the American Dream " . 
 A number of sportscasters , writers and journalists point to Tunis ' books as inspiration for their careers . Tunis is mentioned by author Daniel Okrent in the dedication for The Ultimate Baseball Book as one of " those responsible for the earliest roots of this project " . Writer and editor Tad Richards says , " I remember telling my mother ... ' When I grow up to be a writer , and people ask me about the greatest influence on my writing career , I 'm going to say John R. Tunis . ' " Among Tunis ' many childhood fans are sports writer and children 's author Thomas J. <unk> , Pulitzer Prize finalist Lee Martin , journalist Charles Kuralt and football legend Johnny Unitas . New York Post columnist and editor Pete Hamill picked The Kid From Tomkinsville as one of his five favorite sports novels , writing that " virtually every sportswriter I know remembers reading it as a boy . " In Partial Payment : Essays on Writers and Their Lives , literary critic Joseph Epstein devotes one chapter , " A Boy 's Own Author " , to Tunis . Epstein admits that re @-@ reading many childhood favorites can be disappointing , but found upon revisiting Tunis that his books are " pretty serious , and I was utterly absorbed in them " . 
 In The Continuum Encyclopedia of Children 's Literature Nancy Horton called Tunis " the forefather of the genre of young adult sports fiction " . His novels changed the way sports fiction was written , adding depth by addressing social themes and adolescent issues . Up until his time sports stories focused solely on the games , and treated the athletes as Horatio Alger stereotypes . His stories gave the games context and addressed the pressures and problems of growing up in the spotlight , moving sports from the realm of pulp magazines to serious fiction . 
 In his tribute to the writer , Bernard Hayes said " Tunis has probably made good readers of millions of young people . " His success with the juvenile audience helped change the publishing industry . Along with writers like Howard Pease , his books demonstrated to publishers that there was money to be made in targeting books for teenagers . His influence went beyond simply creating a market for young adult books . " In his attempt to link sports with the communities in which they are played , he broached some highly significant issues in the literature written for and about America 's youth " , according to John S. Simmons in John R. Tunis and the Sports Novels for Adolescents : A Little Ahead of His Time . Tunis never considered himself a writer of boys ' books , insisting his stories could be read and enjoyed by adults . He felt that the word " juvenile " was an " odious ... product of a merchandising age " . Despite his dislike of the term , Tunis ' novels helped create and shape the juvenile fiction book market .

 = M @-@ 51 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 51 is a north – south state trunkline highway in the southwestern portion of the US state of Michigan . The southern terminus is at a connection with State Road 933 across the Michigan – Indiana state line near South Bend , Indiana . From there the trunkline runs north through an interchange with US Highway 12 ( US 12 ) into Niles along a route that was once part of Business US 12 ( Bus . US 12 ) . North of Niles , the highway runs parallel to a river and a rail line through rural areas . The northern terminus is on Interstate 94 ( I @-@ 94 ) west of Paw Paw . 
 There were two other highways that bore the M @-@ 51 designation . The first connected Holland and Grand Rapids with the birth of the highway system in 1919 . After the creation of the United States Numbered Highway System in 1926 , the number was moved to a different highway in The Thumb area . That second highway was scaled back and later decommissioned in the 1960s . The current highway dates back to 1971 when the southern end of M @-@ 40 was rerouted , and the previous alignment was given the M @-@ 51 moniker . It was extended to the state line in 1998 to complete the current highway . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 51 starts at the Indiana state line as a continuation of SR 933 into Michigan . The trunkline runs north through residential areas along 11th Street into Niles . On the south side of town , it meets US 12 at an interchange before continuing northward through commercial areas . Between the intersections with Maple and Main streets , M @-@ 51 splits into a one @-@ way pair of streets to follow 12th Street northbound and 11th Street southbound . Oak Street marks the western end of Bus . M @-@ 60 , and M @-@ 51 turns westward on Main Street into downtown Niles . At 5th Street , the highway turns north again to exit downtown . The highway crosses a rail line owned by Amtrak before curving northeasterly near the Plym Park Golf Course . M @-@ 51 angles parallel to the Dowagiac River and the Amtrak line as the highway crosses from Berrien County into Cass County . The landscape transitions to farmland along the river , and the highway turns to the east between <unk> and Pokagon . 
 Past Pokagon , M @-@ 51 turns back northeasterly toward Dowagiac . Once the highway reaches that city , it merges with M @-@ 62 . The two highways run concurrently eastward along Spruce , Main and Division streets through downtown . M @-@ 51 turns to the north along Front Street , separating from the concurrency and leaving downtown . North of town in rural Cass County , M @-@ 51 intersects M @-@ 152 near location where the highway crosses the Dowagiac River . North of that intersection , the trunkline crosses into Van Buren County and turns to the east again . M @-@ 51 passes south of Knickerbocker Lake before turn northeasterly parallel to the rail line along Delaware Street in <unk> after which is heads due north to I @-@ 94 . 
 M @-@ 51 is maintained by MDOT like other state highways in Michigan . As a part of these maintenance responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . MDOT 's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M @-@ 51 were the 20 @,@ 298 vehicles daily south of US 12 ; the lowest counts were the 2 @,@ 658 vehicles per day west of Decatur . M @-@ 51 between US 12 and the state line has been listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Previous designations = = = 
 When the state highway system was originally signed in 1919 , M @-@ 51 was initially designated from Holland to Grand Rapids . The highway ran from Zeeland along a route that used Byron Road and 32nd Avenue to connect with Port Sheldon Street in Jenison before connecting with Chicago Drive . The highway 's course was simplified by 1924 to use Chicago Drive between Zeeland and Jenison . When the US Highway System debuted in 1926 , this original M @-@ 51 was renumbered as an extension of M @-@ 21 , and the M @-@ 51 number was reused for the original M @-@ 27 in The Thumb . The highway ran from Port Huron to M @-@ 83 ( now M @-@ 142 ) west of Harbor Beach . The designation of M @-@ 51 from Port Huron to M @-@ 46 was removed in late 1961 , and the remainder to M @-@ 142 was removed in 1965 . 
 = = = Current designation = = = 
 In 1971 , all of M @-@ 40 south of I @-@ 94 to Niles was reassigned the designation M @-@ 51 while M @-@ 40 was shifted to the east to take over the routing of the contemporary M @-@ 119 between Paw Paw and its intersection with US 12 in Porter Township near Mottville . The routing of M @-@ 51 was extended down to the state line in April 1998 when US 33 was decommissioned out of the state of Michigan ; the extension formed a concurrency with Business US 12 ( Bus . US 12 ) through Niles in the process . In early 2010 , the central section of Bus . US 12 was transferred to the City of Niles . In doing so , the Bus . US 12 designation was decommissioned in the city , removing that designation from the M @-@ 51 concurrency .

 = United States constitutional criminal procedure = 
 The United States Constitution contains several provisions regarding the law of criminal procedure . 
 Petit jury and venue provisions — both traceable to enumerated complaints in the Declaration of Independence — are included in Article Three of the United States Constitution . More criminal procedure provisions are contained in the United States Bill of Rights , specifically the Fifth , Sixth , and Eighth Amendments . With the exception of the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment , the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment , and ( maybe ) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment , all of the criminal procedure provisions of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated to apply to the state governments . 
 Several of these rights regulate pre @-@ trial procedure : access to a non @-@ excessive bail , the right to indictment by a grand jury , the right to an information ( charging document ) , the right to a speedy trial , and the right to be tried in a specific venue . Several of these rights are trial rights : the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses at trial , the right to confront witnesses at trial , the right to a public trial , the right to a trial by an impartial petit jury selected from a specific geography , and the right not to be compelled to testify against oneself . Others , such as the assistance of counsel and due process rights , have application throughout the proceeding . 
 If a defendant is convicted , the usual remedy for a violation of one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant 's sentence . With the exception of structural errors ( such as the total denial of counsel ) , constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis , although they must be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt . With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation , the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant . Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 ( AEDPA ) , these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions . 
 = = Relevant text = = 
 Article Three , Section Two , Clause Three of the United States Constitution provides that : 
 Trial of all Crimes , except in Cases of Impeachment , shall be by Jury ; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed ; but when not committed within any State , the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed . 
 The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides , in relevant part , that : 
 No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the Militia , when in actual service in time of War or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . . . . 
 The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that : 
 In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law , and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation ; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence . 
 The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides , in relevant part , that : 
 Excessive bail shall not be required . . . . 
 The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides , in relevant part , that : 
 [ N ] or shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . 
 = = History = = 
 The Supreme Court of the United States issued almost no constitutional criminal procedure decisions for its first century of existence . Professor Akhil Amar highlights two reasons for this . First , the Court 's decision in Barron v. Baltimore ( 1833 ) meant that the federal constitution did not apply in state proceedings until the incorporation of the Bill of Rights after the Fourteenth Amendment . Second , the Court lacked general appellate jurisdiction over federal criminal cases until 1891 . 
 The Marshall Court possessed jurisdiction in criminal cases only via writs of error from state courts , original writs of habeas corpus , and certificates of division from the circuit courts . In three cases involving certificates of division , the Marshall Court decided issues of double jeopardy , but did not clearly rely on the Double Jeopardy Clause . Similarly , the Marshall Court discussed the level of detail required for a sufficient indictment without explicitly citing the Information Clause of the Sixth Amendment . 
 In two appeals from state courts , the Taney Court considered , and rejected , double jeopardy claims arising from the hypothetical prospect of prosecution by the federal and state governments for the same conduct . 
 The first Supreme Court decisions to reverse state criminal convictions for constitutional procedural reasons involved the exclusion of African @-@ Americans for grand and petit juries — Strauder v. West Virginia ( 1880 ) , Virginia v. Rives ( 1880 ) , Neal v. Delaware ( 1881 ) , Carter v. Texas ( 1900 ) , Rogers v. Alabama ( 1904 ) , and Norris v. Alabama ( 1935 ) — and the conviction African @-@ American defendants for crimes involving white victims in the southern states : by a mob @-@ dominated trial , as in Moore v. Dempsey ( 1923 ) ; and without counsel , as in Powell v. Alabama ( 1932 ) . 
 = = Pre @-@ trial procedure = = 
 = = = Bail = = = 
 U.S. Const. amend . VIII provides : 
 Excessive bail shall not be required . . . . 
 Stack v. Boyle ( 1951 ) is the only case in which the Supreme Court has held the bail imposed to have been constitutionally excessive . There , the Court found $ 50 @,@ 000 to be excessive in relation to the flight risk for impecunious defendants charged under the Smith Act . In United States v. Salerno ( 1987 ) , the Court upheld the Bail Reform Act of 1984 , which authorized the consideration of future dangerousness in the determination of the amount of , or the denial of , bail . 
 The incorporation status of the Excessive Bail Clause is unclear . In <unk> v. <unk> ( 1971 ) , the Court stated in dicta : " Bail , of course , is basic to our system of law , and the Eighth Amendment 's proscription of excessive bail has been assumed to have application to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment . " In Murphy v. Hunt ( 1982 ) , the Court did not reach the issue because the case was dismissed as moot . Bail was included in the list of incorporated rights in McDonald v. Chicago ( 2010 ) , citing <unk> . 
 = = = Grand Jury = = = 
 U.S. Const. amend . V provides : 
 No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the Militia , when in actual service in time of War or public danger . . . . 
 The Grand Jury Clause applies only to capital and " otherwise infamous " crimes . Any crime " punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary " is infamous . Only those convicted of felonies , i.e. crimes punishable by greater than one year of imprisonment , are confined to a penitentiary . Any crime punishable by hard labor , regardless of the term or place of imprisonment , is also infamous . Contempt of court , even if punished by greater than one year imprisonment , is not infamous . In Hurtado v. California ( 1884 ) , the Supreme Court held that the Grand Jury Clause was not incorporated to apply to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment . 
 If the grand jury right attaches , every element of the charged crime must be submitted to the grand jury . Thus , the prosecution cannot augment the indictment without returning to a grand jury . But , the government may narrow the indictment without so returning . 
 The Grand Jury Clause does very little , if anything , to regulate the procedures of the grand jury . For example , the Clause does not prohibit a grand jury indictment based solely on hearsay evidence . Non @-@ fundamental flaws with the grand jury , such as a violation of the defendant 's self @-@ incrimination rights or a violation of grand jury secrecy do not trigger a right not to be tried . In United States v. Williams ( 1992 ) , where the Court rejected a rule that would have required " substantial exculpatory evidence " to be presented to the grand jury , the defendant did not even argue a Fifth Amendment violation . The lack of a grand jury does not deprive the court of jurisdiction , and the defendant may waive the grand jury right . 
 = = = Information = = = 
 U.S. Const. amend . VI provides : 
 In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation . . . . 
 A charging instrument is constitutionally sufficient under this clause ( and under the Grand Jury Clause ) if it ( 1 ) " contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged , and sufficiently <unk> the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet , " and ( 2 ) " shows with accuracy to what extent he may plead " double jeopardy in a subsequent prosecution . This right has been incorporated . 
 In a case submitted to a grand jury , the indictment must satisfy this requirement . In cases not required to be submitted to a grand jury , the formal charging instrument is referred to as an " information " ( in the federal system and in some states ) or a " complaint . " 
 = = = Speedy trial = = = 
 U.S. Const. amend . VI provides : 
 In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy . . . trial . . . . 
 The Speedy Trial Clause regulates delay between the bringing of a formal criminal charge and / or the pre @-@ trial deprivation of the accused 's liberty and the start of trial . The Clause has been incorporated to apply in state prosecutions . 
 In Barker v. Wingo ( 1972 ) , the Supreme Court announced four factors relevant to the determination of a Speedy Trial Clause violation : ( 1 ) the length of the delay , ( 2 ) the reason for the delay , ( 3 ) whether the defendant demanded a speedy trial , and ( 4 ) prejudice . Applying Barker , the Court found such a violation in Doggett v. United States ( 1992 ) , which involved an over eight @-@ year period between indictment and arrest . The only possible remedy for a Speedy Trial Clause violation is dismissal with prejudice . 
 = = = Venue = = = 
 U.S. Const . Art . III , § 2 , cl . 3 provides : 
 Trial of all Crimes . . . shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed ; but when not committed within any State , the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed . 
 The perceived abuse of English criminal venue law was one of the enumerated grievances in the United States Declaration of Independence , which accused George III of the United Kingdom of " transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses . " 
 The " where the said Crimes shall have been committed " language refers to the locus delicti . " [ T ] he locus delicti must be determined from the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it . " Thus , a single crime may often give rise to several constitutionally permissible venues , and venue may be constitutionally permissible even if an individual defendant was never personally present in the relevant state . For example , conspiracy may be prosecuted wherever the agreement occurred or wherever any overt act was committed . 
 For the purposes of constitutional venue , the boundaries of the states are questions of law to be determined by the judge , but the location of the crime is a question of fact to be determined by the jury . 
 The venue provision of Article III ( regulating the location of the trial ) is distinct from the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment ( regulating the geography from which the jury pool is selected ) . The unit of the former is the state ; the unit of the later is the state and judicial district . Unlike judicial districts under the Vicinage Clause , consistent with Article III , Congress may " provide a place of trial where none was provided when the offense was committed , or change the place of trial after the commission of the offense . " 
 = = Trial procedure = = 
 = = = Compulsory process = = = 
 U.S. Const. amend . VI provides : 
 In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor . . . . 
 The Compulsory Process Clause guarantees the defendant the right to obtain favorable witnesses at trial . For example , the Clause prevents a jurisdiction from precluding defendants from calling their codefendants as witnesses . Similarly , the Clause prevents the government from deporting a witness whose testimony would have been both material and favorable to the defense . The right does not pre @-@ empt reasonable procedural rules . Thus , the right does not prevent the preclusion of defense witnesses as a discovery sanction . 
 = = = Confrontation = = = 
 U.S. Const. amend . VI provides : 
 In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him . . . . 
 In Crawford v. Washington ( 2004 ) , the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause bars the " admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial " unless pursuant to one of the " exceptions established at the time of the founding . " " [ W ] hen the <unk> appears for cross @-@ examination at trial , the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements . . . so long as the <unk> is present at trial to defend or explain it . " In Davis v. Washington ( 2006 ) , the Court held that the Clause places no restrictions on <unk> statements . 
 Crawford did not completely define the term " testimonial . " But , Crawford held that , " [ w ] hatever else the term covers , it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing , before a grand jury , or at a former trial ; and to police interrogations . " Laboratory reports of forensic tests are also testimonial , conferring on the defendant a right to cross @-@ examine the analyst who certifies them . 
 Statements made during police interrogation are <unk> if circumstances objectively indicate " that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency " but are <unk> if circumstances objective indicate " that there is no such ongoing emergency , and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution . " " [ T ] he relevant inquiry is not the subjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved in a particular encounter , but rather the purpose that reasonable participants would have had , as ascertained from the individuals ' statements and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred . " 
 One exception established at the founding is if the witness is " unavailable to testify , and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross @-@ examination . " Another such exception is " forfeiture by wrongdoing , " i.e. where the defendant intends to obtain and obtains the absence of the witness by wrongdoing . Still another exception is " the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted . " Another possible exception is for dying declarations , i.e. statements made by a speaker on the brink of death while aware that he or she is dying .

 U.S. Const . Art . III , § 2 , cl . 3 provides : 
 Trial of all Crimes , except in Cases of Impeachment , shall be by Jury . . . . 
 U.S. Const. amend . VI provides : 
 In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . . trial , by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law . . . . 
 One of the enumerated complaints in the Declaration of Independence accused King George III of " depriving us , in many Cases , of the Benefits of Trial by Jury . " 
 Availability 
 Depending on the authorized and actual sentence , upon demand , a criminal defendant has a right to trial by jury . The defendant does not have a right , conversely , to a bench trial without the consent of the prosecution . If the defendant is charged with crimes for which the authorized sentence exceeds six months , whether in state or federal court , the defendant has a right to a jury . Further , the defendant has a right to a trial by jury if the actual sentence exceeds six months and the charged crime has no maximum authorized sentence ( e.g. contempt of court ) . 
 But , the defendant does not have a right to a jury in stacked misdemeanor prosecutions , even if the cumulative authorized imprisonment exceeds six months , as long as the actual sentence does not . Factors other than actual and authorized sentences may be relevant to seriousness , but so far the Court has pushed back against expanding the jury right . 
 <unk> 
 The trial judge has an obligation to ensure an impartial jury , especially vis @-@ a @-@ vis juror biases and media coverage by such means as jury selection ( including voir dire and for @-@ cause challenges ) , jury sequestration , and jury instructions . For example , this may require the court to permit voir dire on the subject of the juror 's potential racial prejudice . In some circumstances , the Sixth Amendment even requires the trial judge to grant a defendant 's change of venue motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise . 
 The Sixth Amendment also regulates the availability and use of cause and peremptory challenges . For example , it precludes a jurisdiction from granting the prosecution for @-@ cause removal of jurors who oppose the death penalty . " The most that can be demanded of a <unk> in this regard is that he be willing to consider all of the penalties provided by state law , and that he not be irrevocably committed , before the trial has begun , to vote against the penalty of death regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge in the course of the proceedings . " While a defendant is not obliged to use peremptory challenges to cure a trial court 's erroneous denial of a defendant 's for @-@ cause challenge , if the defendant does so , the defendant may not rely on the error for automatic reversal . 
 Size and unanimity 
 The Supreme Court has held that six @-@ member juries are sufficient and that five @-@ member juries are not . Verdict unanimity is not required for twelve @-@ member juries , but is required for six @-@ member juries . 
 Vicinage 
 The provision requiring that the jury be drawn " of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , which district shall have been previously ascertained by law " is known as the Vicinage Clause . The Vicinage Clause places no limits on the prosecution of crimes not committed within a state . Nor does the Clause prevent a crime from being tried by a jury from a different division ( a subset of a federal judicial district ) within the same district in which the crime was committed . The Third , Fifth , and Sixth Circuits have held that the Vicinage Clause was not incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment . 
 = = = Public trial = = = 
 U.S. Const. amend . VI provides : 
 In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . . public trial . . . . 
 The defendant has a right to have the courtroom open to the public , absent a showing of a substantial government interest that cannot be addressed by alternatives other than closure . The right to a public trial extends to pre @-@ trial matters such as a suppression hearing and jury selection . The Public Trial Clause has its roots in the " traditional Anglo @-@ American distrust for secret trials has been variously ascribed to the notorious use of this practice by the Spanish Inquisition , to the excesses of the English Court of Star Chamber , and to the French monarchy 's abuse of the lettre de cachet . " 
 The Sixth Amendment public trial right is held by the defendant , and the excluded public have no ability to assert it . Independently , however , the public has a substantially similar First Amendment right to attend . 
 = = = Self @-@ incrimination = = = 
 U.S. Const. amend . V provides : 
 [ N ] or shall any person . . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . . 
 While the Self @-@ <unk> Clause primarily implicates the law of criminal investigations , the Clause also protects against self @-@ incrimination that may occur at trial . Plainly , the Clause prevents the government from compelling the defendant to testify against himself or herself at trial . Further , if the defendant chooses to testify , the Clause prevents the state from requiring her to testify first . But , if the defendant testifies , she cannot claim the privilege against self @-@ incrimination with respect to cross @-@ examination within the scope of the direct examination . 
 Similarly , the Clause " forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused 's silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt . " This principle applies at the sentencing phase , even after a plea of guilty . While the defendant is entitled to an jury instruction forbidding adverse inferences from his or her failure to testify , a defendant is not entitled to prevent such an instruction . 
 " Nothing in the Fifth Amendment privilege entitles a defendant as a matter of constitutional right to await the end of the State 's case before announcing the nature of his defense , any more than it entitles him to await the jury 's verdict on the State 's case @-@ in @-@ chief before deciding whether or not to take the stand himself . " For example , a jurisdiction may require the defendant to disclose intended alibi witnesses before trial . 
 = = Double jeopardy = = 
 U.S. Const. amend . V provides : 
 [ N ] or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . . 
 The Double Jeopardy Clause encompasses four distinct prohibitions : subsequent prosecution after acquittal , subsequent prosecution after conviction , subsequent prosecution after certain mistrials , and multiple punishment in the same indictment . Jeopardy " attaches " when the jury empaneled , the first witness is sworn , or a plea is accepted . The " dual sovereignty doctrine " permits the federal government and each state to proceed separately . 
 Prosecution after acquittal 
 The government is not permitted to appeal or try again after the entry of an acquittal , whether a directed verdict before the case is submitted to the jury , a directed verdict after a deadlocked jury , an appellate reversal for sufficiency ( except by direct appeal to a higher appellate court ) , or an " implied acquittal " via conviction of a lesser included offense . In addition , the government is barred by collateral estoppel from re @-@ litigating against the same defense a fact necessarily found by the jury in a prior acquittal , even if the jury hung on other counts . 
 This principle does not prevent the government from appealing a pre @-@ trial motion to dismiss or other non @-@ merits dismissal , or a directed verdict after a jury conviction , Nor does it prevent the trial judge from entertaining a motion for reconsideration of a directed verdict , if the jurisdiction has so provided by rule or statute . Nor does it prevent the government from retrying the defendant after a deadlocked jury , an appellate reversal other than for sufficiency , including habeas , or " thirteenth juror " appellate reversals notwithstanding sufficiency on the principle that jeopardy has not " terminated . " There may also be an exception for judicial bribery , but not jury bribery . 
 Multiple punishment , including prosecution after conviction 
 In Blockburger v. United States ( 1932 ) , the Supreme Court announced the following test : the government may separately try and punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element that the other does not . Blockburger is the default rule , unless the legislatively intends to depart ; for example , Continuing Criminal Enterprise ( CCE ) may be punished separately from its predicates , as can conspiracy . 
 The Blockburger test , originally developed in the multiple punishments context , is also the test for prosecution after conviction . In Grady v. Corbin ( 1990 ) , the Court held that a double jeopardy violation could lie even where the Blockburger test was not satisfied , but Grady was overruled in United States v. Dixon ( 1993 ) . 
 Prosecution after mistrial 
 The rule for mistrials depends upon who sought the mistrial . If the defendant moves for a mistrial , there is no bar to retrial , unless the prosecutor acted in " bad faith , " i.e. goaded the defendant into moving for a mistrial because the government specifically wanted a mistrial . If the prosecutor moves for a mistrial , there is no bar to retrial if the trial judge finds " manifest necessity " for granting the mistrial . The same standard governs mistrials granted sua <unk> . 
 = = Assistance of Counsel = = 
 U.S. Const. amend . VI provides : 
 In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence . 
 The Assistance of Counsel Clause includes , as relevant here , at least six distinct rights : the right to counsel of choice , the right to appointed counsel , the right not to be constructively denied counsel , the right to conflict @-@ free counsel , the effective assistance of counsel , and the right to represent oneself pro se . 
 A defendant does not have a Sixth Amendment right to counsel in any civil proceeding , including a deportation hearing ( even though <unk> is often a collateral consequence of criminal conviction ) . 
 Choice of counsel 
 A defendant must be given an opportunity to retain counsel , even if not entitled to appointed counsel . Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest , scheduling , counsel 's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction , and counsel 's willingness to represent the defendant ( whether pro bono or for a fee ) , criminal defendants have a right to be represented by counsel of their choice . The remedy for erroneous <unk> of first choice counsel is automatic reversal . 
 In <unk> & Drysdale v. United States ( 1989 ) , the Court held that there is no Sixth Amendment exception to criminal forfeiture ; i.e. , after conviction , the government can seek forfeiture of already paid legal fees under a forfeiture statute , notwithstanding the effect on the defendant 's ability to retain counsel of choice . 
 Appointment of counsel 
 A defendant unable to retain counsel has the right to appointed counsel at the government 's expense . While the Supreme Court recognized this right gradually , it currently applies in all federal and state criminal proceedings where the defendant faces authorized imprisonment greater than one year ( a " felony " ) or where the defendant is actually imprisoned . 
 A defendant does not have a right to appointed counsel if he or she is not sentenced to actual imprisonment and could not have been sentenced for more than one year , even if that conviction is later used to enhance sentencing for another crime , or even if the revocation of probation may result in actual imprisonment . Nor does the defendant have the right to appointed counsel to raise frivolous arguments on direct appeal , or to raise any arguments on habeas or other collateral appeal , even if facing execution . 
 Constructive denial 
 Whether counsel are appointed or retained , the Clause protects the role of counsel and certain attributes of the attorney @-@ client relationship . For example , the Clause requires that the defendant be given time to consult with counsel and that counsel be given time to investigate the case pre @-@ trial . And , the Clause also prohibits a state from barring a defendant from being cross @-@ examined by counsel , or restricting the order in which the defendant may be called as a witness . Further , the court may not prevent a defendant from consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess , even if the recess bisects <unk> and cross @-@ examination of the defendant . Similarly , the defendant has a right to have her counsel make a closing argument , even if a bench trial . 
 Conflict @-@ free counsel 
 Whether counsel is retained or appointed , the defendant has a right to counsel without a conflict of interest . If an actual conflict of interest is present , and that conflict results in any adverse effect on the representation , the result is automatic reversal . The general rule is that conflicts can be knowingly and intelligently waived , but some conflicts are un @-@ <unk> . 
 <unk> assistance of counsel 
 In Strickland v. Washington ( 1984 ) , the Court held that , on collateral review , a defendant may obtain relief if the defendant demonstrates both ( 1 ) that defense counsel 's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness ( the " performance prong " ) and ( 2 ) that , but for the deficient performance , there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different ( the " prejudice prong " ) . 
 To satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland , a defendant who pleads guilty must show that there is a reasonable probability that , but for counsel 's deficient performance , he or she would not have plead guilty . In Padilla v. Kentucky ( 2010 ) , the Court held that counsel 's failure to inform an alien pleading guilty of the risk of deportation fell below the objective standard of the performance prong of Strickland and permitted an alien who would not have plead guilty but for such failure to withdraw his guilty plea . 
 To satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland , a defendant who rejects the prosecution 's plea offer must show that there is a reasonable probability that , but for counsel 's deficient performance , the offer would have been accepted by the defendant , not withdrawn by the prosecution , and accepted by the court , and that the sentence actually received exceeded that which would have been received under the plea . 
 Pro se representation 
 In <unk> v. California ( 1975 ) , the Court held that a criminal defendant has the right to knowingly and voluntarily opt for pro se representation at trial . This right is not per se violated by the appointment of standby counsel . There is no constitutional right to self @-@ representation on appeal . 
 = = Clauses of general applicability = = 
 All of the foregoing constitutional provisions apply exclusively to criminal matters . In contrast , the due process and equal protection clauses have substantial application outside of the criminal law . 
 = = = Due process = = = 
 U.S. Const. amend . V provides : 
 [ N ] or shall any person . . . be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . . . . 
 U.S. Const. amend . XIV , § 1 provides : 
 [ N ] or shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . . . . 
 The due process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments apply generally to all stages of criminal proceedings . The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was the vehicle for the incorporation of all of the foregoing rights ( with the exception of the Grand Jury Clause , the Vicinage Clause , and maybe the Excessive Bail Clause ) to apply in state criminal proceedings . Due process is also the catchall vehicle for the enforcement of fundamental fairness , even if the infirmities of a given prosecution do not neatly sound in another enumerated provision . 
 Proof beyond a reasonable doubt 
 The due process clauses require that the burden of proof in criminal cases be placed on the government , and that the quantum of proof be beyond a reasonable doubt . In re Winship ( 1970 ) explicitly held that " the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged . " But , the state may place the burden of proof for an affirmative defense on the defendant . 
 Erroneous denial of a reasonable doubt instruction is a structural error that entitles the defendant to automatic reversal . Erroneous definitions of reasonable doubt do not require reversal as long as " taken as a whole , the instructions correctly conveyed the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury . " Instructions on certain evidentiary presumptions against the defendant , if interpreted as conclusive presumptions or as shifting the burden of proof to the defendant , are also unconstitutional ; permissive presumptions are constitutional . In some circumstances , a trial court must separately instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence , in addition to giving a reasonable doubt instruction . 
 The reasonable doubt standard is primarily effectuated by jury instructions , but it retains its relevance when the trial judge considers a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal and when an appellate court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence . On federal habeas review of a state conviction for sufficiency of the evidence , to grant relief , the reviewing court must find that " upon the record evidence adduced at the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt . " In a successive , abusive , or defaulted federal habeas review of a state conviction , a defendant claiming " actual innocence " must show that " it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt . " 
 Brady disclosure 
 Brady v. Maryland ( 1963 ) is another significant , specific criminal procedural right guaranteed by the due process clauses . Brady requires a criminal conviction to be reversed if the government withholds exculpatory ( or impeachment ) material , within the government 's possession , from the defendant , and there is a reasonable probability that , if such material had been disclosed , the result of the proceeding would have been different ( " materiality " ) . Brady is a holistic , rather than piece @-@ by @-@ piece , inquiry . 
 Whether the government acted in " good faith " or " bad faith " is irrelevant to Brady . But , if the defendant cannot prove that withheld evidence would have been exculpatory , because its import is unknown , to obtain relief , the defendant must instead show that the government acted in bad faith . 
 The government is not required to disclose impeachment material prior to plea bargaining . Whether the government must disclose exculpatory material during plea bargaining is an open question . 
 Mental competence 
 " It has long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him , to consult with counsel , and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial " consistent with the Due Process Clause . The " test " is " whether he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding — and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him . " 
 A state may place the burden on the defendant has to prove incompetence by the preponderance of the evidence , but the state cannot require the defendant to prove incompetence by a higher standard , such as clear and convincing evidence . The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary . The state may involuntarily medicate the defendant in order to make her competent for trial , but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment ( as opposed to civil confinement ) , that the medication is likely to result in competence , and that the medication is necessary to restore competence . 
 A defendant who is competent to stand trial is therefore also competent to plead guilty , waiving the full panoply of trial rights , but not necessarily competent enough to represent herself at trial in the face of a state procedural rule requiring a higher standard of competence for pro se representation . 
 Prosecutorial misconduct 
 Due process prohibits the prosecution from knowingly using falsehood to convict the defendant , and requires reversal if there is a reasonable likelihood that the verdict was affected — whether the falsehood is inculpatory or goes the credibility of a witness . 
 = = = Equal protection = = = 
 U.S. Const. amend . XIV , § 1 provides : 
 [ N ] or shall any State . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . 
 The equal protection clauses has at least three applications relevant to criminal proceedings : a prohibition on selective prosecution on invidious bases , a requirement that jury pools and <unk> represent a " fair cross section " of the community , and a prohibition on the discriminatory use of jury peremptory challenges . 
 Selective prosecution 
 The defendant may move to dismiss a criminal charge on the ground that he or she has been singled out for prosecution because of race , gender , religion , national origin , illegitimacy , or similar . In order to get discovery on a racial selective prosecution claim , the defendant must make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races . The defendant is not entitled to a presumption of selective prosecution based on data regarding the overall population of convicts . 
 Discrimination in the jury pool and venire 
 The Equal Protection Clause prohibits the exclusion of persons from selection for a grand or petit jury on the basis of race , regardless of the race of the defendant . 
 Further , the defendant is entitled to a jury pool that represents a " fair cross section " of the community . In order to prove a " fair cross section " violation , the defendant must show that ( 1 ) a " distinctive " ( i.e. , cognizable ) group ( 2 ) is not represented fairly and reasonably in the jury pool in proportion to the community ( 3 ) due to systematic exclusion . 
 Discriminatory peremptory challenges 
 While a defendant is entitled to a fair cross section in the venire , the defendant is not guaranteed a fair cross section in the actual grand jury or petit jury . Yet , the equal protection clause does regulate the use of peremptory challenges in the selection of the petit jury from the venire . In the landmark case of Batson v. Kentucky ( 1986 ) , the Supreme Court reversed a criminal conviction because of the prosecutor 's racially motivated use of peremptory challenges . 
 There are three steps to a Batson inquiry . First , the party opposing the use of a peremptory challenge must make a prima facie case . This requires only an inference , not preponderance . Second , the party seeking the peremptory challenge must provide a permissible , neutral explanation for the challenge . Third , the trial court must decide whether the explanation is <unk> . A rationale is <unk> if it applies equally to a similarly situated juror who was seated . 
 If the trial judge erroneously permits the striking of a juror under Batson , and the error is preserved , the only remedy is automatic reversal . If the trial judge erroneously prevents the striking of a juror under Batson , and the juror is seated , the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis . The race of the defendant is irrelevant to a Batson claim . Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ( " reverse Batson " ) . And , Batson applies equally to race and gender . 
 = German destroyer Z5 Paul Jacobi = 
 Z5 Paul Jacobi was a Type 1934A @-@ class destroyer built for the Kriegsmarine in the mid @-@ 1930s . The ship was being refitted when World War II began on 1 September 1939 and was tasked to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods in the Kattegat until early 1940 . She participated in the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign by transporting troops to the Trondheim area in early April 1940 and was transferred to France later that year where she made several attacks on British shipping . Paul Jacobi spent most of 1941 under repair and returned to France in early 1942 to successfully escort two German battleships and a heavy cruiser home through the English Channel ( the Channel Dash ) . The following month , the ship helped to escort another German battleship to northern Norway and returned in May to begin another lengthy refit . 
 Paul Jacobi spent most of 1943 inactive in the Arctic before returning to Germany in September for another refit . She was badly damaged by Allied air attacks on Kiel and was not operational again until late 1944 . She spent most of the rest of the war escorting ships as the Germans evacuated East Prussia and bombarding Soviet forces . The ship was captured by the Allies in May 1945 and spent the rest of the year under British control as the Allies decided how to dispose of the captured German ships . 
 Paul Jacobi was ultimately allotted to France in early 1946 and renamed Desaix . She became operational later that year , but her service with the French Navy was fairly brief , with only cruises to French colonies in Africa during 1947 of note before she was paid off in late 1948 and placed in reserve in early 1949 . The ship was used as a source of spare parts of the other ex @-@ German ships in French service until she was condemned and sold for scrap in 1954 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Z5 Paul Jacobi had an overall length of 119 meters ( 390 ft 5 in ) and was 114 meters ( 374 ft 0 in ) long at the waterline . At some point before September 1939 , her stem was lengthened , which increased her overall length to 120 meters ( 393 ft 8 in ) . The ship had a beam of 11 @.@ 30 meters ( 37 ft 1 in ) , and a maximum draft of 4 @.@ 23 meters ( 13 ft 11 in ) . She displaced 2 @,@ 171 long tons ( 2 @,@ 206 t ) at standard load and 3 @,@ 110 long tons ( 3 @,@ 160 t ) at deep load . The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets , each driving one propeller shaft , were designed to produce 70 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 51 @,@ 000 kW ; 69 @,@ 000 shp ) using steam provided by six high @-@ pressure Wagner boilers . The ship had a designed speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) , but her maximum speed was 38 @.@ 7 knots ( 71 @.@ 7 km / h ; 44 @.@ 5 mph ) . Paul Jacobi carried a maximum of 752 metric tons ( 740 long tons ) of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 100 km ; 5 @,@ 100 mi ) at a speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) , but the ship proved top @-@ heavy in service and 30 % of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship . The effective range proved to be only 1 @,@ 530 nmi ( 2 @,@ 830 km ; 1 @,@ 760 mi ) at 19 knots . The crew numbered 10 officers and 315 enlisted men , plus an additional four officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a flotilla flagship . 
 The ship carried five 12 @.@ 7 @-@ centimeter ( 5 in ) SK C / 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields , two each superimposed , fore and aft . The fifth gun was carried on top of the aft superstructure . Her anti @-@ aircraft armament consisted of four 3 @.@ 7 @-@ centimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) SK C / 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 @-@ centimeter ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) C / 30 guns in single mounts . Paul Jacobi carried eight above @-@ water 53 @.@ 3 @-@ centimeter ( 21 in ) torpedo tubes in two power @-@ operated mounts . A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount . Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern . Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each . Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines . A system of passive hydrophones designated as ' GHG ' ( Gruppenhorchgerät ) was fitted to detect submarines . 
 An active sonar system was probably installed by the end of 1940 , but it is uncertain when it was actually done . During the war , the ship 's light anti @-@ aircraft armament was augmented several times . Improved 2 cm C / 38 guns replaced the original C / 30 guns and three additional guns were added sometime in 1941 . The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced by a single 2 cm quadruple Flakvierling mount , probably during her mid @-@ 1942 refit . During 1944 – 45 , Paul Jacobi was one of the few destroyers to receive the full " Barbara " anti @-@ aircraft refit in which all of her existing 3 @.@ 7 cm and most of her 2 cm guns were replaced with improved models in greater numbers . The fifth 12 @.@ 7 cm gun was removed to compensate for the weight of the additional weapons . She retained her Flakvierling mount and , by the end of the war , the rest of her anti @-@ aircraft armament consisted of four twin and two single 3 @.@ 7 cm SK M / 42 mounts , four twin and one single 2 cm mounts on the forecastle and sides of the bridge .

 Paul Jacobi , named after Paul Jacobi , was ordered on 9 January 1935 and laid down at DeSchiMAG , Bremen on 15 July 1935 as yard number <unk> . She was launched on 24 March 1936 and completed on 29 June 1937 . The ship participated in the late 1937 naval maneuvers as part of the Second Destroyer Division ( 2 . Zerstörerdivision ) . Paul Jacobi and her sister ship Z8 Bruno Heinemann sailed to Norway in April 1938 to test the new 15 @-@ centimeter ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) <unk> C / 36 gun planned for later classes of destroyers . Bruno Heinemann had been fitted with four of the new weapons and they were removed after gunnery trials off Ålesund were completed . Paul Jacobi participated in the August 1938 Fleet Review as part of the 2nd Destroyer Division and the following fleet exercise . The division accompanied the heavy cruiser Admiral Graf Spee on her voyage to the Mediterranean in October where they visited Vigo , Tangiers , and Ceuta before returning home . The destroyer had a lengthy refit at Wilhelmshaven from February 1939 to 29 September . 
 After she finished working up on 11 October , Paul Jacobi was tasked to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods in the Skaggerak until February 1940 between visits to the shipyard . The ship was allocated to Group 2 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserübung . The group 's task was to transport the 138th Mountain Infantry Regiment ( Gebirgsjäger @-@ Regiment 138 ) of the 3rd Mountain Division to seize Trondheim together with the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper . The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day . Paul Jacobi and her sisters Bruno Heinemann and Theodor Riedel each carried a company of mountain troops tasked to seize the forts defending the entrance to the Trondheimsfjord . En route the weather was so bad that Paul Jacobi rolled so far to port that water flooded the port boiler intakes , temporarily shutting down the port engine , and washing five men overboard . After passing the surprised forts the ships were able to land their troops and capture the forts with little difficulty . All of the destroyers had suffered storm damage en route and were low on fuel because none of the oil tankers had arrived yet . Admiral Hipper was ordered home on 10 April . Fuel was transferred from Paul Jacobi and Bruno Heinemann to Friedrich Eckoldt , enough to allow her to escort the cruiser home . Paul Jacobi remained in Trondheim until early May with engine troubles . Her aft torpedo tubes were removed and remounted on a pair of impounded small boats to improve the local defenses . Sometime in 1940 – 41 the ship was fitted with a FuMO 21 or FuMO 24 radar set above the bridge . 
 She arrived at Wilhelmshaven on 10 May and spent the next month under repair . Paul Jacobi returned to Trondheim on 30 June and helped to screen the crippled battleship Gneisenau as she returned to Kiel on 25 July . The ship laid a minefield in the North Sea before she was transferred to the Atlantic Coast of France in mid @-@ September . Now based at Brest the ship helped to lay a minefield in Falmouth Bay during the night of 28 / 29 September . Five ships totalling only 2 @,@ 026 GRT were sunk by this minefield . Paul Jacobi arrived back at Wilhelmshaven to begin a lengthy refit that lasted until October 1941 . While departing Aarhus , Denmark for Norway , she fouled a buoy that damaged her port propeller and had to return to Kiel for repairs that took until 24 November . After loading mines at Aarhus , she had a boiler breakdown and had to return to Germany . While docked at Wilhelmshaven on 29 December , Paul Jacobi was slightly damaged by bomb splinters that also killed three crewmen . 
 She escorted the battleship Tirpitz for several days in mid @-@ January 1942 as the battleship sailed from the Baltic to Trondheim . Paul Jacobi , together with the rest of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla , sailed from Kiel on 24 January for France as part of the preparations for the Channel Dash . On the evening of 25 January , Z8 Bruno Heinemann struck two mines laid by HMS Plover off the Belgian coast and sank . Paul Jacobi rescued 34 of the survivors and proceeded to Le Havre to put them ashore before reaching Brest on the 26th . The German ships departed Brest on 11 February , totally surprising the British . Paul Jacobi helped to repel an attack by five British destroyers and evaded a series of aerial attacks without damage . Shortly afterwards , the ship joined four other destroyers in escorting Prinz Eugen and the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer to Trondheim . Heavy weather forced Paul Jacobi and two other destroyers to return to port before reaching Trondheim and Prinz Eugen was badly damaged by a British submarine after their separation . On 6 March , the battleship Tirpitz , escorted by Paul Jacobi and three other destroyers , sortied to attack the returning convoy QP 8 and the Russia @-@ bound PQ 12 as part of Operation Sportpalast ( Sports Palace ) , but the ship was ordered back to port that evening . Two months later , in Operation <unk> ( Magic Flute ) , Paul Jacobi , the destroyer Z25 , and two torpedo boats escorted the badly damaged heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen from Trondheim to Kiel from 16 – 18 May . Two days after her arrival , the destroyer began a lengthy refit that lasted until December . 
 On 9 January 1943 , together with two other destroyers , she escorted Scharnhorst and Prinz Eugen as they attempted to return to Norway from Gotenhafen . The ships were spotted en route two days later by an aircraft from the Royal Air Force and the attempt was abandoned as the element of surprise was lost . The following month , Paul Jacobi made her way independently to Bogen Bay , Norway . She screened the battleships Tirpitz and Scharnhorst , as well as Lützow to the Altafjord , closer to the Allied convoy routes to Russia , in mid @-@ March . Two weeks later , the ship , her sister Z6 Theodor Riedel , and the destroyer Z20 Karl Galster sailed for Jan Mayen island on 31 March to rendezvous with the blockade runner , MV Regensburg . They searched for several days before increasingly heavy weather forced them to return to port with storm damage . Unbeknownst to the Germans , Regensburg had been intercepted and sunk by a British cruiser on 30 March . Paul Jacobi escorted Lützow back to Kiel in September and then began yet another lengthy refit on 30 September . 
 The ship was badly damaged during an air raid on Kiel on 13 December . One bomb struck the forecastle and started a severe fire while four others landed inside the dry dock itself , riddling her with splinters and sinking the ship . Paul Jacobi was not refloated until April and the refit itself was not completed until November . The ship had to be fitted with a new bow section , new radars , and a new goalpost @-@ shaped foremast to allow the radar antenna to rotate a full 360 ° . After being damaged again by bomb splinters during an air raid on 18 July , she was towed to Swinemünde to be completed . Paul Jacobi was declared operational on 13 November and she escorted the hospital ship SS General von Steuben from Gotenhafen to Swinemünde . The destroyer 's new 3 @.@ 7 cm guns were installed on 20 December . While conducting torpedo training off the Swedish island of Gotland on 14 January 1945 , one of her torpedoes circled back around and hit Paul Jacobi , inflicting only minor damage . She was back in action by the 19th , escorting ships in the eastern Baltic Sea . During one of these missions , the ship was accidentally rammed in the stern by the freighter SS Helga Schröder . Repairs took until 27 February to complete , and the Kriegsmarine took advantage of the opportunity to add more AA guns . 
 Paul Jacobi bombarded Soviet forces on 6 – 9 March and alternated between bombardment and escort tasks for the rest of the war as the Germans evacuated East Prussia in the face of advancing Soviet armies . On 2 May , her gyrocompass was sabotaged by some of her crew to prevent the ship from screening the last few refugee convoys . Three men were convicted by a drumhead court @-@ martial and sentenced to death by Rear Admiral ( Konteradmiral ) Bernhard Rogge . Paul Jacobi was decommissioned five days later at Flensburg and sailed to Wilhelmshaven under British control on 21 May to have her fate determined . France was initially denied any of the captured ships , but eventually received Paul Jacobi and three other destroyers . She arrived in Cherbourg on 15 January 1946 and was turned over to the French on 4 February . 
 Renamed Desaix that same day , after General Louis Desaix , the ship was assigned to the 1st Division of Large Destroyers ( contre @-@ torpilleurs ) and conducted trials in September . In March – June 1947 , she formed part of the escort for the battleship Richelieu as the President of France , Vincent Auriol , visited West and North Africa . Desaix visited North Africa by herself later that year . She took part in the spring naval maneuvers in 1948 and in a naval review for Auriol off Brest on 30 May . The ship was present in Saint @-@ Malo during the commemoration of the centenary of the death of François @-@ René de Chateaubriand and she visited Bordeaux before returning to Cherbourg on 4 November . Desaix was decommissioned before the end of the year and reduced to reserve in January 1949 . She was used as a source of spare parts until she was condemned on 17 February 1954 . Her hulk was redesignated as <unk> and she was sold for scrap in June . She was towed to Rouen for demolition . 
 = Portrait of a Young Girl ( Christus ) = 
 Portrait of a Young Girl is a small oil @-@ on @-@ oak panel painting by the Early Netherlandish painter Petrus Christus . It was completed towards the end of his life , between 1465 and 1470 , and is held in the Gemäldegalerie , Berlin . It marks a major stylistic advance in contemporary portraiture ; the girl is set in an airy , three @-@ dimensional , realistic setting , and stares out at the viewer with a complicated expression that is reserved , yet intelligent and alert . 
 It is widely regarded as one of the most exquisite portraits of the Northern Renaissance . Art historian Joel Upton described the sitter as resembling " a polished pearl , almost opalescent , lying on a cushion of black velvet . " The panel builds on the work of Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden , and was highly influential in the decades after its completion . Its appeal lies in part in her intriguing stare , accentuated by the slight misalignment of her eyes , while the eyebrows are faintly skewed .
