 US Highway 131 ( US 131 ) is a north – south United States Highway , of which all but 0 @.@ 67 of its 269 @.@ 98 miles ( 1 @.@ 08 of 434 @.@ 49 km ) are within the state of Michigan . The highway starts in rural Indiana south of the state line as a state road connection to the Indiana Toll Road . As the road crosses into Michigan it becomes a state trunkline highway that connects to the metropolitan areas of Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids before continuing north to its terminus at Petoskey . US 131 runs as a freeway from south of Portage through to Manton in the north . Part of this freeway runs concurrently with Interstate 296 ( I @-@ 296 ) as an unsigned designation through Grand Rapids . US 131 forms an important corridor along the western side of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan , running through rural farm and forest lands as well as urban cityscapes . Various names have been applied to the roadway over the years . The oldest , the Mackinaw Trail , originated from an Indian trail in the area while other names honored politicians . An attempt to dedicate the highway to poet James Whitcomb Riley failed to gain official support in Michigan . 
 The first state highways along the US 131 corridor were designated as early as 1919 . When the US Highway System was formed on November 11 , 1926 , US 131 was created along the route of M @-@ 13 in Michigan . Originally ending at Fife Lake on the north end , the highway was extended to Petoskey in the late 1930s . Further changes were made , starting in the 1950s , to convert segments of the road to a full freeway . The state started this conversion simultaneously at two locations : heading north from Three Rivers , and heading both north and south from a point in southern Kent County . A third segment was built south of Cadillac and over subsequent years Michigan filled the gaps in the freeway . Cadillac and Manton were bypassed in the early part of the 21st century , resulting in the current freeway configuration . Another large @-@ scale construction project in 2000 rebuilt an unusual section of the freeway through Grand Rapids known as the S @-@ Curve . Two bridges formerly used by US 131 have been labeled by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) as historic structures ; one of them has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( NHRP ) . 
 Plans to further extend the freeway have either been canceled or placed back under study . Upgrades on the north end through Kalkaska ceased to be considered in 2000 . South of Three Rivers , MDOT is studying possible upgrades to US 131 . One option for these upgrades is a full freeway , an option that was initially rejected . The preferred alternative in 2008 was a two @-@ lane bypass of Constantine that opened in October 2013 .

 Running 269 @.@ 98 miles ( 434 @.@ 49 km ) in Indiana and Michigan , US 131 in its entirety is listed as a part of the National Highway System , a system of roads crucial to the nation 's economy , defense and mobility . As a state highway in both states , the roadway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation ( INDOT ) and MDOT . The Michigan section includes approximately 172 miles ( 277 km ) of freeway between Kalamazoo and Wexford counties .

 US 131 extends 0 @.@ 67 miles ( 1 @.@ 1 km ) through Elkhart County , Indiana , between the entrance to the Indiana Toll Road , a few hundred feet north of the Toll Road overpass , and the state line to the north . State Road 13 ( SR 13 ) runs concurrently with US 131 in this section but is not signposted . INDOT surveys the roads under its control on a regular basis to measure the amount of traffic using the state 's highways . These traffic counts are expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) , a calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . The 2007 survey reported average daily traffic of 7 @,@ 949 cars and 2 @,@ 068 trucks .

 As a state trunkline highway , US 131 runs approximately 266 miles ( 428 km ) in Michigan , from the Indiana state line north to Petoskey . The highway is an important link between Grand Rapids and the tourist areas of Northern Michigan . The trunkline enters Michigan about three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) south of White Pigeon , crossing a branch of the Michigan Southern Railroad before meeting US 12 on the west side of the village . The highway passes through rural farmland north to just south of Constantine , where US 131 turns northeastward to bypass the downtown business district , crosses the St. Joseph River and continues north to Three Rivers . The stretch of highway between Constantine and the start of the divided highway south of Three Rivers averaged 7 @,@ 579 cars and 1 @,@ 045 trucks daily in 2009 according to MDOT , one of the lowest AADT counts for the highway in Michigan . 
 US 131 runs through a business corridor along the west side of Three Rivers . M @-@ 60 runs concurrently along this part of US 131 until the two highways meet the south end of the business loop through town . The main road curves to the northeast as it leaves town , and M @-@ 60 turns east to follow Business US 131 ( Bus . US 131 ) into downtown . The trunkline runs parallel to a branch of the Grand Elk Railroad . North of the other end of the business loop , US 131 follows a four @-@ lane surface highway through rural farmland in northern St. Joseph County . The highway has at @-@ grade junctions with cross roads , but otherwise has limited access from adjoining property . This arrangement ends on the south side of Schoolcraft , where the highway transitions to follow Grand Street through town . North of town US 131 returns to an expressway as the highway continues through southern Kalamazoo County farmland . 
 After an intersection with Shaver Road , US 131 widens into a full freeway which passes the <unk> State Game Area as it enters the Kalamazoo metropolitan area . US 131 meets I @-@ 94 southwest of Kalamazoo and picks up the Business Loop I @-@ 94 ( BL I @-@ 94 ) designation for a couple of miles . This secondary designation leaves the freeway at exit 36 and follows US 131 's business loop along Stadium Drive into downtown Kalamazoo near the main campus of Western Michigan University . As the freeway passes the west side of Kalamazoo the environs change to a more forested and semi @-@ residential area . US 131 passes the northern end of Bus . US 131 , a freeway spur accessible from the southbound lanes of US 131 . North of this partial interchange the freeway crosses into eastern Allegan County . 
 = = = West Michigan = = = 
 As US 131 passes through the outskirts of Plainwell , it curves to the northeast through a commercial area centered around the interchange with M @-@ 89 . North of this area US 131 crosses the Kalamazoo River and runs past the US 131 Raceway Park , a dragstrip close to the M @-@ 222 interchange near Martin . The freeway continues north through mixed farm and forest land to the residential areas that abut it in Wayland . Further north the highway crosses into Kent County and the southern end of the Grand Rapids metropolitan area . 
 As the freeway continues farther north , and closer to Grand Rapids , it is lined with more commercial and light industrial properties . The unincorporated suburb of <unk> lies to the east as US 131 approaches M @-@ 6 , the South Beltline Freeway , and meets in the largest freeway interchange in West Michigan . Gaining a third lane in each direction , the interchange stretches over a half mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) in width and over a mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) in length and encompasses 27 bridges and 18 retaining walls . US 131 continues north through the city of Wyoming to the more suburban residential areas near the southern city limits of Grand Rapids north of M @-@ 11 ( 28th Street ) . 
 The freeway continues through the southern end of Grand Rapids , alongside residential areas until Burton Street . A large rail yard abuts the trunkline on the east , and the freeway turns northeasterly on its approach to downtown . At Wealthy Street , the freeway takes a sharp turn to the west to cross the Grand River and immediately turns back north on a bridge structure known as the S @-@ Curve . The highest traffic volumes along US 131 are located north of this river crossing . In 2009 , MDOT measured an AADT of 107 @,@ 200 cars and 5 @,@ 992 trucks through the stretch between Market Avenue and Pearl Street . The trunkline continues past the Gerald R. Ford Museum and the Public Museum of Grand Rapids before the northbound carriageway crosses over , then back under , the southbound lanes , forcing traffic through this stretch to briefly drive on the left . North of I @-@ 196 , US 131 picks up a second , hidden designation on highway inventory logs called I @-@ 296 , although the number is not signposted along the road . I @-@ 296 / US 131 continues along the banks of the Grand River into Walker where the hidden I @-@ 296 designation turns to the northwest along a series of ramps to I @-@ 96 while US 131 curves to the northeast along a bend in the river . As it continues along the river the freeway passes through the unincorporated community of Comstock Park and near to Fifth Third Ballpark , home of the West Michigan Whitecaps local minor league baseball team . 
 The trunkline turns north , away from the river , as it nears the stadium and passes through the remainder of the northern suburb , changing to a more rural character as the freeway passes through the northern end of Kent County . M @-@ 46 joins US 131 from the west at Cedar Springs and the two highways pass into northwestern Montcalm County near Sand Lake . North of Pierson the landscape is dominated by forests . M @-@ 46 turns east and leaves the freeway near Howard City while US 131 continues into Mecosta County near the Little Muskegon River . The freeway forms the eastern boundary of the Manistee National Forest near the river and north to Big Rapids . Further north M @-@ 20 joins the US 131 freeway near Stanwood and the two highways cross the Muskegon River on the way to Big Rapids . The city is served by its own business loop and M @-@ 20 turns east off the freeway along Bus . US 131 toward the main campus of Ferris State University . North of Big Rapids US 131 runs through rural Osceola County to a junction with US 10 at Reed City .

 Passing through rural Osceola County and providing access to rural communities such as Le Roy and Tustin , US 131 approaches the south side of Cadillac in Wexford County . At exit 176 , M @-@ 55 leaves a concurrency with M @-@ 115 and joins the US 131 freeway around the east side of Cadillac . This bypass was built in the early 21st century and the old routing is now a business loop through downtown . M @-@ 55 follows the freeway to exit 180 while US 131 continues around the east side of Cadillac and north around the east side of Manton . The lowest freeway traffic counts along US 131 , 7 @,@ 455 cars and 709 trucks in 2009 , are on the northeast side of Manton , as the trunkline transitions back to a two @-@ lane undivided highway before meeting the north end of Manton 's business loop . 
 The two @-@ lane highway runs through the Pere Marquette State Forest and over the Manistee River , crossing the southeast corner of Grand Traverse County . It meets the southern end of M @-@ 113 in Walton , where it runs parallel to the Great Lakes Central Railroad . Passing through Fife Lake , US 131 crosses into Kalkaska County and to South Boardman . The area around South Boardman is marked by farmland as the trunkline crosses the Boardman River in the small unincorporated community . The road once again runs parallel to the railroad as it meets M @-@ 66 / M @-@ 72 south of Kalkaska . The three highways join and run concurrently through downtown . North of town M @-@ 72 turns west toward Traverse City and US 131 / M @-@ 66 continues north through farmland into Antrim County . About 3 – 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 – 5 @.@ 6 km ) north of town , standing on the west side of the road , is the Shoe Tree . A local icon since shortly after the turn of the 21st century , the origins of the landmark are unknown . 
 The trunkline follows the railroad into Antrim and Mancelona . North of downtown Mancelona M @-@ 66 turns north toward Charlevoix and US 131 continues along the Mackinaw Trail , through Alba . M @-@ 32 follows US 131 for a half mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) near the community of Elmira . As it continues farther north US 131 enters the Mackinaw State Forest . Here , MDOT has calculated the lowest average daily traffic counts of all on US 131 : 5 @,@ 114 cars and 448 trucks in 2009 . The highway passes through rural Charlevoix County where the terrain has many rolling hills and begins to descend to Lake Michigan . As the highway enters the southern section of the city of Petoskey it runs along Spring Street passing retail establishments and the Odawa Casino , owned by the Little Traverse Bay Indian Reservation of the Odawa Indians . At the northern terminus of US 131 , US 31 turns off Charlevoix Avenue and follows Spring Street to the north .

 MDOT operates 67 rest areas and 14 welcome centers in the state , all named in honor of retired department employees . Eight of these are along US 131 , providing bathroom facilities , dog runs , picnic areas and usually vending machines . The rest areas near Kalamazoo , Rockford , Big Rapids and Tustin serve southbound traffic while those near Morley and Cadillac serve the northbound side of the freeway . The two near Manton and Fife Lake are accessible from both directions . A ninth rest area used to exist near <unk> on the northbound side of US 131 , but this location was demolished on January 22 , 2001 , to make way for the interchange with M @-@ 6 . The department wanted to build a replacement near Dorr , in northern Allegan County , but the plans were canceled in late 2001 . 
 MDOT removed the honoree 's name from the Tustin rest area in early 2011 . The former employee , Larry Brown , was a district engineer that retired from the department in 1997 after 30 years of service . He pleaded no contest on a sexual assault charge , which prompted MDOT to remove his name from the rest area when notified of his conviction . A new honoree will be chosen by the department 's Rest Area Committee . 
 MDOT has also built carpool lots for motorists along the freeway . There are 21 lots , all but one adjacent to a freeway interchange . The department touts these lots as a way to save money and benefit the environment , and has partnered with a network of local agencies offering Local <unk> Offices .

 Before Michigan became a state , the first land transportation corridors were the Indian trails . The original Mackinaw Trail ran roughly parallel to the route of the modern US 131 from east of Kalkaska to Petoskey . In the 19th century , the Michigan Legislature chartered private companies to build and operate plank roads or turnpikes in the state . These roads were originally made of oak planks , but later legislation permitted gravel as well . Two thoroughfares in the Grand Rapids area , Division and Plainfield avenues , were originally plank roads . The companies were funded through the collection of tolls . The infrastructure was expensive to maintain , and often the turnpikes fell into disrepair as the wood warped and rotted away . Mark Twain once commented that " the road could not have been bad if some unconscionable scoundrel had not now and then dropped a plank across it , " after a trip on the Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids Plank Road . By the first decade of the 20th century , only 23 of the 202 chartered turnpikes were still in operation ; many companies that received a charter never built their specified roadways . The remaining plank roads were turned over to the state or purchased by railway companies in the early part of the century . 
 The first state @-@ maintained highway along the path of US 131 was M @-@ 13 , a designation applied to the road by July 1 , 1919 . US 131 debuted along with the rest of the initial U.S. Highway System on November 11 , 1926 , although at the time it was shown on maps from the Michigan – Indiana state line north to the small Northern Michigan community of Acme in Grand Traverse County . The northernmost section of the highway between Fife Lake and Acme was not signposted in the field and the designation ended instead at Fife Lake , about 213 miles ( 343 km ) north of the state line . At the same time , the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) redesignated the remainder of M @-@ 13 , between Fife Lake and Petoskey , as M @-@ 131 . Public Act 131 of 1931 allowed the MSHD to take control over the city streets that carried state highways through cities in the state . Until this point , the City of Grand Rapids arbitrarily moved the route of state highways through the city on a regular basis . The department took control of a series of streets and fixed the routing of US 131 through the city after the passage of the act . The highway was shifted between Three Rivers and Constantine to the west side of the St. Joseph River in 1936 . In late 1938 or early 1939 , the MSHD extended US 131 northward over the southern section of M @-@ 131 . After the changes US 131 turned eastward into Fife Lake and north to Kalkaska and Mancelona before ending in Petoskey . This extension connected US 131 directly to its parent highway , US 31 , for the first time . By the end of the 1930s , the MSHD under the leadership of future governor Murray Van Wagoner had shifted emphasis to a program of road improvements designed to make the state 's roads " safer and smoother for burgeoning traffic volumes . " 
 In 1940 , a new roadway was opened , completing the third side of a triangle between the junction with M @-@ 113 , Walton Corners and Fife Lake . US 131 was shifted to the new highway and the former routing along the other two sides of the triangle became part of M @-@ 113 and M @-@ 186 . A second realignment opened the following year between Fife Lake and Kalkaska . US 131 no longer turned east along Boardman Road between South Boardman and Lodi . Instead the MSHD rerouted the highway directly to the northeast , from the end of the previous new routing north of Fife Lake to <unk> . By 1945 , a Bypass US 131 was created around the south and east sides of Grand Rapids , following 28th Street and East Beltline Avenue , while the main highway continued to run through downtown unchanged . A decade later , mainline US 131 was rerouted around Grand Rapids over the former bypass route , and Business US 131 ( Bus . US 131 ) was created for the former route through downtown . A second business loop was created in Three Rivers , Michigan , after an expressway bypass of the city 's downtown was opened in early 1954 . Another expressway section was opened between Mancelona and the M @-@ 32 junction west of Elmira in late 1956 . 
 = = = Freeway conversion = = = 
 By the end of 1957 , US 131 had been realigned as an expressway from the Three Rivers bypass to <unk> . The section of freeway in the Grand Rapids area opened near the southern county line north to 28th Street . This latter freeway segment was extended further south to Wayland by the middle of 1958 . By the middle of 1960 , the freeway was extended to M @-@ 118 in Martin , where traffic used M @-@ 118 to connect back to the old routing . The southern end of US 131 was moved to another location on the state line . Instead of running concurrently with US 112 between White Pigeon and Mottville , US 131 ran directly south of White Pigeon to the state line . In the process , the M @-@ 103 designation was swapped with US 131 . 
 The MSHD had proposed that the section of US 131 south of Kalamazoo be built as an electronic highway under a bid through General Motors the same year ; the testing for such a roadway was ultimately done at Ohio State University instead . Another project , through the end of 1961 , extended the freeway south to Plainwell and north into downtown Grand Rapids . This extension was designated as part of Bus . US 131 and opened in December 1961 . The opening ceremony for the bridge across the Grand River included the state highway commission and the then @-@ Miss Michigan , pulled by a team of sled dogs , to lead the first traffic over the river . 
 Until the early 1960s , US 131 never left the state of Michigan ; the southernmost point was always at the Indiana state line . In 1961 , the highway designation was extended to its current southern terminus in rural Elkhart County , Indiana at a connection with the Indiana Toll Road at the request of the state of Michigan . The MSHD asked the Indiana State Highway Department ( <unk> ) to extend US 131 farther to reconnect with US 31 in Indiana near Indianapolis . Michigan State Highway Commissioner John C. Mackie said that officials with the <unk> were " receptive to the idea " of a further addition to Indianapolis which would provide a " great benefit to Michigan 's tourist industry " . 
 On December 17 , 1962 , the freeway through downtown Grand Rapids was completed , including the section marked as I @-@ 296 . The business loop was removed from the freeway when US 131 took its place . East Beltline Avenue was renumbered as an extension of M @-@ 44 , while 28th Street retains the M @-@ 11 / M @-@ 21 designations it had in addition to US 131 . I @-@ 296 / US 131 runs alongside the Grand River between I @-@ 96 downtown and I @-@ 196 north of town . At the end of I @-@ 296 , US 131 followed I @-@ 196 east to the northern portion of the business loop at Plainfield Avenue and followed Plainfield Avenue back to the remainder of its routing north of Grand Rapids . The other end of the freeway was extended south to M @-@ 43 on the west side of Kalamazoo . Traffic there is directed along M @-@ 43 into downtown to connect with the remainder of the highway . 
 Freeway construction continued through the 1960s . By the end of 1963 , the southern section of freeway was extended to Schoolcraft . The following year , a business loop in Kalamazoo was created . The new loop used a freeway stub on the north and M @-@ 43 on the south to connect the main highway to the former routing of US 131 along Westnedge and Park avenues downtown . A discontinuous segment of freeway , south of Cadillac into Osceola County , opened in September 1966 . The freeway was extended north from the Grand Rapids area through the Comstock Park area in 1966 . That year , the former Grand Rapids <unk> , a local race car track was closed . Located on North Park Street between the North Park Bridge and West River Drive , the track was in operation from 1950 until it was closed for the freeway construction in 1966 . The freeway was extended further to M @-@ 57 ( 14 Mile Road ) near Cedar Springs in 1969 . 
 In 1968 , the section of expressway near Mancelona was downgraded to a two @-@ lane highway . The original roadway had been left in place when a new parallel carriageway was built in 1956 . During the winter months , the original lanes built in the 1920s were closed because the grade of the roadway accumulated additional snow and made it difficult to plow . The MSHD had considered reconstructing the older road to retain the expressway setup , but that would have cost $ 1 @.@ 5 million while removing it and permanently reconfiguring the 1956 roadway cost only $ 170 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 17 @.@ 8 million and $ 2 @.@ 02 million in 2015 ) . 
 The 1970s saw the US 131 freeway expand to north of Grand Rapids . The section between the two M @-@ 57 junctions near Rockford and in Cedar Springs opened on September 21 , 1973 , at a dedication ceremony featuring then @-@ Congressman Gerald R. Ford . By the end of the year , the freeway would be open as far north as Howard City . At the same time , M @-@ 46 was realigned to extend south down the freeway to Cedar Springs and west to replace M @-@ 57 west of Rockford . 
 Construction to complete these sections north of Grand Rapids had been delayed in 1967 . Before the delays , the MSHD planned to have the gap in the freeway between Grand Rapids and Cadillac completed by 1974 . The state even proposed adding the freeway north of Grand Rapids to Petoskey , with a further continuation to Mackinaw City as part of the Interstate Highway System in an effort to receive additional funding in 1968 . In September 1972 , the US 131 Area Development Association lobbied Congress to " expedite funding and priority for the reconstruction of US 131 in Michigan . " 
 The 12 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 19 @.@ 6 km ) section of US 131 freeway south of the Wexford – Osceola county line was opened on November 9 , 1976 , at a cost of $ 7 @.@ 4 million ( equivalent to $ 47 @.@ 9 million in 2015 ) . By 1977 , the state postponed any plans to complete the freeway north of Cadillac . The department cited rising construction material costs and opposition to the freeway in Petoskey . By the end of the decade , I @-@ 296 signs were removed from the section of freeway in Grand Rapids . However , the freeway remains listed as a part of the Interstate Highway System . 
 The next section of freeway opened between Howard City and Stanwood in 1980 . Another segment was opened farther north , bypassing Big Rapids by 1984 . The former route through town and a section of M @-@ 20 were designated as a business loop simultaneously . US 131 followed 19 Mile Road between the end of the freeway and the former routing north of town . The gap was filled in when the freeway segment between Big Rapids and Osceola County was opened in 1986 . The section of highway along 19 Mile Road was transferred to the Big Rapids business loop to connect it back to the new freeway . When the expansions ended , in the mid @-@ 1980s , it was expected that the US 131 freeway would end at the south side of Cadillac , " perhaps forever " . MDOT had ended all consideration of additional freeway mileage in 1981 , citing decreased gas tax revenues , decreased traffic and higher construction costs . A 1979 report said that while traffic forecasts showed continued growth , upgrades to existing roads would be sufficient to handle traffic needs . 
 = = = S @-@ Curve replacement = = = 
 One of the more unusual sections of the US 131 freeway in the Grand Rapids area is the S @-@ Curve . This section of freeway carries US 131 over the Grand River with two sharp turns in the road , resembling the letter S. The design for this structure was completed in 1952 and placed the freeway on the least expensive land in the area , despite the knowledge that it would someday create issues . As noted by the The Grand Rapids Press in 1981 , " the speed limit on the S @-@ Curve must be reduced as low as 25 mph [ 40 km / h ] on some bad @-@ weather days because of the sharpness of the turns and [ the ] numerous accidents [ that ] have occurred there . " 
 On December 27 , 1999 , the state awarded a $ 85 @.@ 7 million contract ( equivalent to $ 138 million in 2015 ) for the replacement of the S @-@ Curve on US 131 . Deposits of gypsum under the roadway were dissolving and causing it to settle . A deteriorating bridge also forced the reconstruction of the freeway through the area . Construction began on January 15 , 2000 , diverting the roughly 115 @,@ 000 vehicles per day that used the stretch of road to detours through the downtown area . As part of the project , a $ 1 @.@ 2 million ( equivalent to $ 1 @.@ 84 million in 2015 ) de @-@ icing system was installed . The system is designed to spray a de @-@ icing fluid on the roadway that would be carried by car tires up to a mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) along the road surface . This fluid is expected to melt ice at temperatures below the − 20 ° F ( − 29 ° C ) at which salt stops working . Unlike salt , the non @-@ corrosive de @-@ icer does not harm the bridge , but it is more costly . The system is designed to be activated manually , or automatically via sensors along the road . However , plowing would still be required on the roadway . The idea behind the de @-@ icing system is to keep the pavement wet and prevent the formation of ice . 
 Construction delays were caused by river flooding during spring rains . A design mistake meant that one of the bridges in the structure was built a foot ( 30 cm ) too low , and Grandville Avenue was lowered to compensate for the error . Before the opening , MDOT held a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony on the freeway to allow local residents to walk along the structure on August 12 . The first northbound lanes were opened to traffic in mid @-@ August , three weeks ahead of schedule . Lead contractor Kiewit Western , a company whose " employees have been known to work 13 @-@ hour days and 100 @-@ hour weeks " , accelerated their work schedule over the course of the project to compensate for the delays and still finish the venture early . The remaining lanes opened to traffic on October 26 , also ahead of schedule . Additional work started after the main roadway opened by closing various ramps for reconstruction . This work also focused on restoring parking lots located under or adjacent to the freeway and testing the de @-@ icing system ; the final ramps were opened in early December 2000 and early January 2001 . The end result of the construction produced a freeway design that increased the rated traffic speed from 45 to 50 mph ( 72 to 80 km / h ) .

 MDOT approved a $ 3 @.@ 5 billion 10 @-@ year transportation plan ( equivalent to $ 10 @.@ 2 billion in 2015 ) in 1986 that included an extension of the US 131 freeway north to Manton . Construction started on the Cadillac bypass in 1999 , and the first section was opened to traffic in November 2000 . This 3 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) southern segment ran from US 131 south of town to M @-@ 55 east of downtown . US 131 remained routed through downtown , but M @-@ 55 was rerouted to the bypass . Local residents were allowed to use the northern section of the bypass for recreational activities until it was opened to traffic . The full 9 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 14 @.@ 8 km ) bypass around Cadillac was dedicated to Sidney Ouwinga in a ceremony on October 27 , 2001 , and the road was opened to traffic on October 30 , 2001 . The former routing through town was redesignated Bus . US 131 at the same time . Ouwinga was a state lawmaker who died in 1991 while serving in the Michigan House of Representatives . He was also a member of the US 131 Area Development Association which promoted further northern extensions of the freeway . The 10 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 16 @.@ 9 km ) freeway expansion north around the city of Manton was opened in 2003 . The former routing was redesignated as a business loop at the time . The two bypasses cost $ 146 million ( equivalent to $ 219 million in 2015 ) to complete .

 Design plans for the new bridge over the St. Joseph River were announced in January 2011 .

Residents in the community were divided over the proposed five @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) highway . Business owners look to the 3 @,@ 000 cars and trucks that pass through downtown Constantine each day for customers , traffic that would be diverted around the village by the new roadway . On the other hand , residents that work outside of the small community were looking forward to decreased commute times to their workplaces . The bypass opened on October 30 , 2013 .

 Originally , MDOT and its predecessor agencies had planned to convert US 131 into a freeway all the way to Petoskey . They suggested adding the highway to the Interstate Highway System in the late 1960s , when the federal government took proposals for additions to the network of highways . While further northward extension of the freeway from Manton to Kalkaska and beyond was postponed by the department in the 1970s , and canceled " perhaps forever " in the early 1980s , MDOT made an attempt to revive the extension to Kalkaska in 2000 . The proposal was ultimately abandoned when the year 's transportation plan was finalized . A bridge replacement project over the Manistee River in 2009 – 10 ensured the end of further consideration by MDOT of the proposal . According to the local project director , " currently , the department has no plans [ to expand the freeway ] . Someday it may happen , but not in the foreseeable future . " 
 A southerly extension of the freeway to or near the Indiana state line is still under study . Improvements to the US 131 corridor from Portage to the Indiana Toll Road have been underway for several years and although a late @-@ 2005 decision by MDOT to not pursue a new controlled @-@ access route through St. Joseph County seemed to terminate the discussion , public outcry and backlash from local legislators forced the department to re @-@ evaluate its decision . State House Speaker Craig <unk> was critical of the original decision , citing the economic development benefit such a road would bring to the area in defense of the proposed freeway . The previous " no @-@ build decision " was rescinded in April 2006 . 
 MDOT has begun a project to upgrade a 16 @.@ 4 @-@ mile ( 26 @.@ 4 km ) segment of US 131 in St. Joseph County , home of one of the most dangerous roadway sections in Southwest Michigan for auto crashes . The final environmental impact statement for the project was published in mid @-@ 2008 and the preferred alternative consists of a two @-@ lane road bypassing the village of Constantine . The new highway would maintain access to local roads via at @-@ grade intersections , and the department would maintain jurisdiction of the old route through town . MDOT has stated that present traffic demands do not warrant the cost of a full freeway facility on a new alignment from the Indiana Toll Road to north of Three Rivers , stating that such a project would cost over $ 300 million ( equivalent to $ 361 million in 2015 ) to build . Construction plans were placed on hold after an announcement in June 2009 as various proposals around the state , including the Constantine bypass , were shelved until funding issues could be resolved . In total , 137 road and bridge projects totaling $ 740 million were delayed to 2012 because the state could not match available federal funding to pay for the work . 
 = = Memorial designations = = 
 US 131 and its predecessors bears several memorial designations in addition to the Sidney Ouwinga Memorial Bypass near Cadillac . One of the oldest is the Mackinaw Trail , named after a former Indian trail that ran from Saginaw to Mackinaw City and Sault Ste . Marie . By 1915 , the name was transferred to the roadway that was later numbered US 131 . The Mackinaw Trail Association was formed that year to promote an all @-@ weather highway between Grand Rapids and Mackinaw City , using a logo incorporating a trout for the road . The name was to be officially applied to the highway in 1929 , but the State Senate did not agree to the proposal . The official endorsement of the name came in 1959 , after the opening of the Mackinac Bridge revitalized the idea . 
 During World War I , households would display a service flag if a family member was serving in the war . A blue star denoted a service member in action , and a gold star symbolized someone who died in the military . In St. Joseph County , the chapters of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the American Legion wanted to honor the local fallen soldiers . Using the flags as inspiration , they planted 100 black walnut and four Norway spruce trees along the road south of Three Rivers . Dedicated on May 4 , 1924 , this tribute was named the Gold Star Memorial Highway and ran for 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) along what is now US 131 south of Three Rivers . 
 In 1921 , the section of highway south of Kalamazoo was named part of the Colgrove Highway . This designation included several other roads in the Lower Peninsula , all named in honor of Philip Colgrove , the first president of the Michigan Good Roads Association . Colgrove was also the Barry County prosecutor and a state senator in the late 19th century . No maps documents the name , although the original law remains in records . The Michigan Legislature proposed a bill in 2000 that would have repealed the 1921 statute naming the Colgrove Highway , but the bill ultimately faded , sparing the name . 
 In the age of the auto trails , it was common for highways to be named rather than numbered . An attempt to create a trail such as the Lincoln Highway failed in Michigan . School children in 1926 from Anderson , Indiana , wanted to honor James Whitcomb Riley , the poet from the Hoosier State , with a highway that connected the country 's summer and winter resort areas . The Michigan segment of the road running through the state was to follow what would later be US 131 . The James Whitcomb Riley Association promoted the highway by painting white bands on telephone poles with the name of the road in orange letters during that August and September . However , the road in question was already named the Mackinaw Trail , and the association did not secure permission of the state highway commissioner , as was required by a 1919 Michigan law . The law made it illegal for any " association to delineate or mark any other routes or trails through the State of Michigan ... unless the same shall be approved in writing by the State Highway Commissioner . " As a result , government officials refused to endorse the association 's proposal , and Michigan was excluded from the highway . The efforts of the national association were stunted by the halted progress , and the highway was disbanded by December 1926 . 
 The Michigan Trail , another auto trail from the 1920s , " followed just about every major trunk line at that time in the Lower Peninsula and covered over a thousand miles [ 1 @,@ 600 km ] of state highways . " The Michigan Trail started in Toledo , Ohio , and ran to Detroit ; its branches extended to New Buffalo , Grand Rapids , and Port Huron . Other segments included US 131 between Kalamazoo and Petoskey , US 31 between New Buffalo and the Straits of Mackinac and a route between Port Huron and Big Rapids . The highway failed as a concept because it lacked focus , and many of the segments of roadway had already assigned names . 
 The most recent name applied to US 131 is related to the first . Enacted in 2004 , Public Act 138 added an additional name to the Mackinaw Trail from the M @-@ 66 junction near Kalkaska to Petoskey , the " Green Arrow Route @-@ Mackinaw Trail " . Residents of the state have questioned the wisdom of having a " compound road name whose signboards [ would ] be nearly as long as the highway itself . " 
 = = Historic bridges = = 
 MDOT maintains a listing of historic bridges that includes two which formerly carried US 131 . In 1913 , the State Trunk Line Act required the highway department to build and maintain bridges at the state 's expense if they were included in the nascent highway system . Among the first of these state @-@ built structures is the Division Avenue – Plaster Creek Bridge in Grand Rapids . The crossing is listed on the NHRP for its architectural and engineering significance . Built as Trunk Line Bridge No. 3 over Plaster Creek in 1914 by the MSHD , the span cost just over $ 6 @,@ 000 . Division Avenue carried US 131 until the construction of the freeway through Grand Rapids in the 1960s . The bridge , a filled spandrel arch design , is 50 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 15 m ) , and was modified in 1935 to widen its deck from 28 feet ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) to the current 43 feet ( 13 m ) . The structure was added to the NRHP on December 17 , 1999 . 
 The second bridge listed by MDOT is the crossing of the Little Muskegon River for 190th Avenue in southern Mecosta County . Like the Plaster Creek bridge , this structure was also built by the MSHD under the Trunk Line Act of 1913 . Built in 1916 – 17 the 45 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 14 m ) , 18 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) , concrete through @-@ girder bridge cost around $ 10 @,@ 000 to build . It was initially named Trunk Line Bridge No. 61 . The span is the oldest concrete girder bridge designed by the MSHD . US 131 followed 190th Avenue over the river until a realignment shifted the highway to another route in 1927 .

 410 Tactical Fighter Operational Training Squadron ( French : <unk> Escadron d <unk> <unk> à l 'appui <unk> ) , nicknamed the " Cougars " , is a Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft squadron currently located at Canada 's primary training base for the CF @-@ 18 ( Canadian Forces version of the McDonnell Douglas F / A @-@ 18 Hornet ) , at Cold Lake , Alberta . The squadron was formed during the Second World War as an RCAF squadron under the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) , at RAF Ayr , near Prestwick , in Scotland . 
 The first official sortie of No. 410 Squadron was from RAF Drem , East Lothian , Scotland , on the night of 4 June 1942 , when twelve Beaufighter crews took off , and it went on to become the top @-@ scoring night fighter squadron in the RAF Second Tactical Air Force during the period between D @-@ Day and VE @-@ Day . 
 No. 410 Squadron supported the Allied forces during the Normandy Landings and the Battle of the Bulge , flew nightly patrols during this time and many of its pilots gained ace status . Two members of No. 410 Squadron , Flight Lieutenant ( F / L ) Currie and Flying Officer ( F / O ) Rose , were the first members of the RCAF to see the German V @-@ 2 rocket in flight . 
 The squadron was disbanded in 1964 but reformed again in 1968 . 
 As No. 410 Tactical Fighter Operational Training Squadron , the squadron usually trains between 20 and 22 pilots a year on the CF @-@ 18 , more than any other RCAF squadron . The Canadian documentary television series Jetstream was filmed with the squadron in 2007 and showed what trainees must endure to become fighter pilots . 
 = = Badge = = 
 No. 410 Squadron 's badge depicts a cougar 's face with a background <unk> ( waning ) moon . The cougar , a North American mountain cat , was chosen because of the speed and power of its attacks . The waning moon refers to the squadron 's night operations . These two major devices are in reference to the squadron 's Second World War night fighter activities , when the unit was renowned for its skill and number of victories . The squadron 's motto is <unk> , which means " wandering by night " .

 No. 410 Squadron was formed at RAF Ayr , near Prestwick , Scotland in June 1941 , as a Royal Canadian Air Force " Article XV squadron " , under Royal Air Force operational control .

 No. 410 Squadron was the third RCAF night fighter squadron to be formed and was equipped with the Boulton Paul Defiant . In May 1942 these were replaced by the Bristol Beaufighter , and in October of the same year these were in turn replaced with De Havilland Mosquito Mk IIs , with which the first victory for the squadron was claimed . No. 410 Squadron was acknowledged as the top @-@ scoring night fighter unit in RAF Second Tactical Air Force in the period between D @-@ Day and VE Day , although No. 409 Squadron RCAF can now make a similar claim , on the basis that there were many victories quickly counted up during 1944 and 1945 . 
 = = = = Bases = = = = 
 From RAF Ayr , No. 410 Squadron was moved to RAF Drem in East Lothian , but returned to RAF Ayr 10 months later . On 1 September 1942 the squadron was moved to RAF Scorton in North Yorkshire , England , but just under two months after that it was relocated to RAF Acklington in Northumberland . In 1943 the squadron was placed at RAF Coleby Grange in Lincolnshire , then moved for the sixth time to RAF West Malling in the southeast of England , and then to RAF Hunsdon , just north of London . Later it was moved to RAF Castle Camps , and then back to RAF Hunsdon . On 18 June 1944 , the squadron was placed at RAF <unk> in Wiltshire , only to be moved again to RAF <unk> in Wiltshire . On 9 September 1944 , No. 410 Squadron RCAF was again moved to RAF Hunsdon . Thirteen days later , the squadron was relocated back to their sixth base , RAF Coleby Grange . On 3 November 1944 the Squadron moved to RAF Amiens @-@ <unk> in northern France . Two months later , the squadron was relocated to RAF Lille @-@ <unk> in northern France , the first movement of the squadron in 1945 . From 5 April 1945 the Cougars were back at RAF Amiens @-@ <unk> , and the final move of the war occurred on 9 June 1945 , when the squadron relocated to RAF Gilze @-@ Rijen in the Netherlands . 
 = = = = Operations = = = = 
 The first official sortie occurred on the night of 4 June 1942 , when twelve crews from No. 410 Squadron took off in Beaufighters , but the two scrambles that occurred were uneventful . The first German contact occurred on the night of 6 / 7 September 1942 , when a Beaufighter II from RAF Scorton flown by P / O R.R. Ferguson and P / O D. Creed ( navigator ) , intercepted a Luftwaffe Ju 88 . The Beaufighter was guided to the Ju 88 approximately 20 miles ( 32 km ) northeast of Whitby on the Yorkshire coast . The attack damaged the Ju 88 , but did not destroy it . Since the aircraft was not destroyed , this did not count as the squadron 's first outright victory . That came on 22 January 1943 , when Flight Sergeant B.M. Haight and Sergeant T. Kipling ( RAF , observer ) , flying a Mosquito II from RAF Acklington , were credited with a Dornier Do 217 , which was destroyed near Hartlepool . This was made possible because of " night readiness " , the ability to fly at a moment 's notice at night . By the end of the war , 75 3 ⁄ 4 victories had been claimed . The squadron flew 2 @,@ 972 sorties and accumulated 28 @,@ 150 hours of flight time . The squadron 's victories included 75 3 ⁄ 4 destroyed , 2 probably destroyed , and 9 damaged . The squadron had the following operational casualties : 17 aircraft and 32 aircrew , of whom 10 were killed , 20 presumed dead , and two were made prisoners of war . Non @-@ operational casualties were : 14 aircraft and 30 personnel , of whom 29 were killed , 1 injured .

 Between November 1943 and May 1944 , the squadron was engaged in the night defence of Britain . On 5 June 1944 , No. 410 Squadron 's Commanding Officer ( CO ) , Wing Commander G.A. Hiltz , flew a four @-@ aircraft detachment to <unk> where they provided fighter cover for the initial airborne landings . Among the pilots who flew that operation was Flight Lieutenant Charles Emanuel " Pop " Edinger , who later became an ace . On the night prior to the Normandy Landings , all of the RAF Second Tactical Air Force 's night fighter squadrons were working hard to ensure safety for the landing force . During June 1944 , 18 of the squadron 's 22 fighters were available , the other four were out for periodic maintenance . At 01 : 00 , the first of four patrols took off , but the patrol was uneventful , with the pilots reporting clouds at 10 @,@ 000 feet . A further five patrols were flown to help cover the 4 @,@ 000 ships that were part of Operation Neptune . On 7 June two of the aircraft were fired upon by friendly Lancaster bombers , who assumed they were hostile . However , No. 410 Squadron claimed its first kill when Flying Officers A. Mcleod and Bob Snowdon destroyed a Junkers Ju 188 . On 12 June the squadron claimed multiple bomber kills . The Cougars shot down 14 raiders with five more probably destroyed or damaged . But the success was overshadowed by the allied invasion of Europe . From June to August 1944 , the squadron was mostly occupied with nightly patrols over the beachheads to guard the Allied troops and shipping against German bombers . No. 410 Squadron 's Mosquitoes brought down thirty @-@ one German aircraft and damaged or destroyed three more , in less than 31 sorties . Then the squadron moved to France and in the next eight months added 25 " kills " and a " damaged " to its score . 
 = = = = = Immediately after D @-@ Day = = = = = 
 For several days following D @-@ Day , the squadron flew patrols and received credits for many kills . In one instance , Warrant Officer ( W / O ) W.F. Price and P / O J.G. Costello shot down two <unk> aircraft in the space of twenty <unk> and the Cougars destroyed twelve German bombers in all . Following this success , however , it was five days before the squadron scored another kill . In the interval , the crews , still maintaining their schedule of nine sorties per night , had little to report . One night an engine in W / C Hiltz ’ s Mosquito failed on the take @-@ off run and the aircraft , swerving off the runway , crashed into " A " Flight dispersal . The crews escaped injury , but many buildings went up in flames . During an operation that resulted in the thirteenth kill of the period , one aircraft crashed and its crew was unable to bail out . For the next week the weather was poor , which restricted night operations . Most of the crews that did go out had to be diverted to other bases on their return . German activity had also diminished by then and the beachhead was much quieter than it had been in mid @-@ June . On the first two nights in July there were no sorties at all . Then the weather improved and the nightly round of nine patrols was resumed . 
 F / L Currie and F / O Rose saw a V @-@ 2 rocket in flight on the night of 10 / 11 September , the first Canadian pilots to do so . While on patrol from Brussels to Antwerp and Rotterdam they saw a bright orange light directly ahead and seemingly at their own altitude , 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) . At first glance , Currie paid no attention to it , taking it for a bright star . Suddenly , Currie said : " It began to climb – hell it climbed ! " The light appeared to go straight up so rapidly that within a few seconds it had passed out of sight . On return to base , the crew reported the sighting as a V @-@ 1 flying bomb , but their account of the spectacular rate of climb and other details aroused great interest amongst senior officers . That night , a few moments after Currie and Rose had made their sighting , a V @-@ 2 rocket crashed onto the English coast . Two nights later , F / Os Fullerton and Gallagher saw a similar ball of yellow flame streak vertically into the night sky , and in the weeks that followed there were many other reports . 
 = = = = = Battle of the Bulge and the end of the war = = = = = 
 In the middle of December , under bad weather conditions , the Nazis launched an offensive in the Ardennes . The Luftwaffe caught many squadrons off guard . No. 410 Squadron enjoyed a number of successes during this period , some of them even on Christmas Day . During the Battle of the Bulge , the entire RAF Second Tactical Air Force , including No. 410 Squadron , was on 48 @-@ hour alert . 
 Although the war was entering its final stages , the squadron still had to watch for anti @-@ aircraft artillery . The fighter squadrons continued to make advances until February , while waiting for the Canadian push through the <unk> . Although there was some aerial fighting , the major conflict with the Luftwaffe occurred when the Canadians started to cross the Rhine on 24 March 1945 . 
 On the evening of 18 December 1944 , during the Battle of the Bulge , Edinger made contact with a Ju 87 , which he then fired upon . His navigator , C.C. <unk> , confirmed the kill , stating that the aircraft had been hit in the starboard engine and had caught fire . The Ju 87 crashed into trees and was engulfed in flames . Flight Lieutenant Rayne Schultz had claimed his fifth kill of the war , a Ju 188 , on 13 / 14 February 1944 . After having returned from working at the Training Command , he claimed another Ju 188 on 10 / 11 April 1945 . He claimed his final kills on 21 / 22 April 1945 by downing two Ju 88s near <unk> . 
 A few days after the Squadron had moved to Lille / <unk> , it was called upon to provide a special patrol of four aircraft as air cover for the Armistice Day ceremonies being held in Paris ; no German intruders attempted to intervene . Later in the month , there was an accident at base that took the lives of two pilots who had recently joined the Cougars . F / Os H. Connelly and J. Hunt had gone up together to practice circuits and landings . As they made a circuit , preparatory to landing , the Mosquito stalled and crashed from 500 feet ( 150 m ) . A few days before Christmas 1944 , there was another accident , the heaviest suffered by the squadron in terms of lives lost . For several days the airfield had been fogbound and when the sky cleared somewhat in the afternoon of 21 December , S / L Fulton , " B ” Flight commander , took off for England in the squadron 's Airspeed Oxford aircraft . With him were three officers and two airmen , all going on leave . Near Wrotham , Kent , the aircraft crashed and only one of its occupants survived . Killed with S / L Fulton were his navigator F / O A.R. Ayton ( RAF ) , who had accompanied him on posting to the Cougars in October , F / L F.G. Thomson , DFC ( RAF ) , who had arrived late in November to begin a second tour , and <unk> E. <unk> and R. Seefried . F / O W. Rumbold , another RAF navigator , was seriously injured ; he had been with the Squadron for two months . The squadron was disbanded at the end of the war on 9 June 1945 .

 At least 12 members of the squadron were decorated during the war , with the award of 11 Distinguished Flying Crosses ( DFC ) and one bar to the DFC , as well as a Distinguished Flying Medal ( DFM ) . The first <unk> went to Acting Flight Lieutenant Martin Anthony <unk> and Flying Officer Harold Herbert <unk> on 9 November 1943 The citation does not mention that they had to return to base on a single engine , and with other damage to the aircraft . This was quickly followed by Flying Officers Rayne Dennis Schultz and Vernon Albert Williams on 14 January 1944 . Again , the citation does not mention the severe damage to their aircraft . At the close of an action with their third Do 217 , which the combat report describes as : " a long duel with the enemy pilot showing a high degree of airmanship , " they were hit by return fire , including a cannon shell that destroyed much of the instrument panel and which narrowly missed the pilot . The starboard engine almost died , then recovered , but then the port engine caught fire . They managed to return to RAF Bradwell with only the starboard engine working , landing at 19 : 45 on 10 December 1943 . 
 Sergeant James Norman was awarded the DFM on 26 September 1944 . Squadron Leader James Dean Somerville and F / O George Douglas Robinson were awarded the DFC on 20 October 1944 . F / L Charles Emanuel Edinger was awarded the DFC on 5 December of the same year , for destroying four Junkers Ju 88s and one unidentified German aircraft between June and October . He subsequently claimed one further Ju 88 and one Junkers Ju 87 in December . 
 Flight Lieutenants Ben Erwin Plumer and William Warren Hargrove received the DFC on 15 December 1944 for shooting down a Messerschmitt Bf 110 on 6 October : F / O Dennis George Tongue was awarded the DFC on 29 December 1944 , and a bar to his DFC on 2 March 1945 . F / O Tongue was a member of the RAF , had been commissioned from sergeant and promoted to flying officer . On the night he won the bar to his DFC , on 25 November 1944 , his pilot was A. A. Harrington of the United States Army Air Forces . They destroyed three Junkers Ju 88s , their own Mosquito having been hit by debris from the second Ju 88 , and during the fight that led to the downing of the third , Tongue was also having to keep track of a further Ju 88 which was endeavouring to attack their aircraft . 
 F / O Donald <unk> Mackenzie was awarded the DFC on 27 February 1945 , having destroyed a Ju 88 on 30 July 1944 , and then two more in a single sortie on 24 December .

 No. 410 Squadron was reactivated on 1 December 1946 as an Air Defence squadron flying de Havilland Vampire F.3 aircraft , and was re @-@ formed from a defence role into that of a fighter role at St Hubert ( Montreal ) , Quebec on 1 December 1948 . From May 1949 to August 1951 , the Blue Devils aerobatics team formed , to demonstrate the abilities of the new Vampire aircraft at formation flying . The squadron later converted to Canadair Sabres and was deployed to Europe , flying from RCAF Station North <unk> in the UK , and then at RCAF Station <unk> ( No. 1 ( Fighter ) Wing ) in France . The squadron had been the first regular force fighter unit to fly the Vampire aircraft and was the first to fly the Sabre and the first to join No. 1 ( Fighter ) Wing of No. 1 Air Division Europe . 
 When No. 445 All Weather ( Fighter ) [ AW ( F ) ] Squadron arrived from Canada , however , No. 410 Squadron was deactivated at <unk> on 1 October 1956 and reactivated as an all @-@ weather fighter squadron at Uplands ( Ottawa ) , Ontario on 1 November of that year , flying Avro Canada CF @-@ 100s . When CF @-@ 100s were removed from service in 1961 , the CF @-@ 101 Voodoo interceptor was introduced for North American air defence . No. 410 Squadron converted to these aircraft and the squadron continued to fly Voodoos until defence cuts led to the squadron being deactivated on 31 March 1964 .

 No. 410 Squadron began flying the North American Harvard training aircraft and then flew the Boulton Paul Defiant from July 1941 to May 1942 . The Boulton Paul Defiant was a " turret fighter " that was used as a night fighter . A problem with this aircraft was that it had no forward armament , and so it was exchanged for the Bristol Beaufighter II , long @-@ range heavy fighter . The Beaufighter was used from April 1942 until January 1943 . The Mk II used the Rolls Royce Merlin engine which provided greater power than the original Beaufighter had had . No. 410 Squadron transitioned to the de Havilland Mosquito Mk II in November 1942 , and the Squadron then used the Mosquito exclusively until the end of the war . It used the variants VI ( July 1943 – September 1943 ) , XIII ( December 1943 – August 1944 ) , and XXX ( August 1944 – June 1945 ) . All of these fighters had the same basic design — that of a low- to medium @-@ altitude daytime tactical bomber , high altitude night bomber , pathfinder , day or night fighter , fighter @-@ bomber , intruder , maritime strike and photo reconnaissance aircraft .

 On 20 December 1961 , No. 410 Squadron became Canada 's first operational CF @-@ 101 Voodoo squadron . The Voodoo was an all @-@ weather interceptor aircraft ; its primary armament was the nuclear @-@ tipped AIR @-@ 2A Genie unguided air @-@ to @-@ air rockets , and was used as Canada 's primary means of air defence .

 No. 410 Squadron is now ( 2010 ) a Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft squadron located at Canada 's primary CF @-@ 18 training base at Cold Lake , Alberta . In 1982 , the squadron was renamed 410 Tactical Fighter ( Operational Training ) Squadron . It runs one fighter pilot course every year , training approximately 20 pilots . The training program consists of nine months of ground school , simulator flights , and operational flying . Students are taken from among the graduates of a Fighter Lead @-@ In Training Course and are provided with the knowledge of basic skills in both air @-@ to @-@ air and air @-@ to @-@ ground combat . Areas covered in depth include aircraft handling , instrument flight , formation flying , night flying , navigation , air @-@ to @-@ air refuelling , and weapons delivery and tactics . 
 There is also an annual Fighter Weapons Instructor Course ( <unk> ) run by No. 410 Squadron , and a Fighter Electronic Warfare and Advanced Radar ( <unk> ) Course . The intense and highly challenging <unk> lasts for three months . Each operational CF @-@ 18 squadron and tactical radar squadron sends candidates ( eight students per course ) who graduate with the leadership qualities and expertise required to return to their squadrons and design tactical training programs themselves . The Advanced Radar Course is conducted in two phases : ground school at 4 Wing , Cold Lake , and a flying phase at an electronic warfare range . This three @-@ week course is designed to allow ten pilots annually to graduate and return to their squadrons as electronic warfare experts and instructors . Since No. 410 Squadron has always had some of the most experienced CF @-@ 18 pilots in the fighter community , it is often charged with carrying out special fighter projects .

 For the first seven years following 1988 , when the CF @-@ 18 was being delivered , the squadron ran six @-@ month full @-@ squadron courses from which the graduating pilots formed new CF @-@ 18 squadrons . Following this initial cadre of courses , No. 410 Squadron trained CF @-@ 18 pilots at a rate of approximately 50 per year . In 1992 , with the closure of three squadrons in Germany , this was reduced to 25 . With the recent reduction in size of the remaining operational squadrons , No. 410 Squadron now trains approximately 20 fighter pilots annually . 
 At the same time as the current work mandate , No. 410 Squadron is also responsible for training and re @-@ certifying about five former CF @-@ 18 Hornet pilots annually . These pilots are returning to the CF @-@ 18 after a ground or exchange tour . No. 410 Squadron also trains newly arrived foreign exchange officers who will be joining one of Canada 's two operational fighter squadrons . As backgrounds can differ significantly , each course is tailored to the individual , based on their experience and demonstrated competencies . Areas covered in depth in the Fighter Pilot Course ( <unk> ) include basic and advanced aircraft handling , instrument flight , formation flying , night flying , all @-@ weather interception , air @-@ to @-@ air refuelling , Basic Fighter Manoeuvres ( BFM – " dogfighting skills " ) and air combat . The latter half of each <unk> comprises academic air @-@ to @-@ ground weapons delivery and Close Air Support ( CAS ) , as well as advanced Air Interdiction ( AI ) tactics , the former usually completed during a squadron deployment to the south @-@ western United States in the late spring and early fall , due to the significantly better weather and the sheer number of bombing ranges available .

 A sub @-@ unit of No. 410 Squadron is the Fighter Operational Test and Evaluation Flight ( <unk> ) , which is responsible for operational testing and evaluation . In 2010 , its efforts were seen as integral to the operational effectiveness of all aspects of core and CF @-@ 18 capabilities . Some of the new systems being evaluated were Night Vision Imaging Systems ( <unk> ) , Multi @-@ function Information Distribution Systems ( <unk> ) , the Advanced Multi @-@ role Infra @-@ Red Sensor , and the evaluation of new mission planning software and the Advanced Distributed Combat Training System .

 The Canadian documentary television series Jetstream was filmed in 2007 , showing life on the base at Cold Lake and what a trainee must endure to become a fighter pilot . The television documentary followed No. 410 Squadron 's training course for the full nine months , and in that time some candidates did not graduate . The television show was given full access to the trainees ' lives from ground school to graduation and was allowed access almost everywhere . The series followed six members of the Canadian Air Force 's " Class of 2006 " who had been selected to learn with No. 410 Squadron . The television show called the air base " fighter town " , but Cold Lake has two squadrons that use fighter / interceptor aircraft , the other being home to No. 409 Squadron , nicknamed " The Nighthawks " . 
 In 2016 , No. 410 Squadron provided the aircraft and pilot for the CF @-@ 18 Demonstration Team . Captain Ryan " Roid " Kean , was selected as the demonstration pilot along with four members from 4 Wing Cold Lake as the western maintenance crew . The theme and paint scheme the 2016 demonstration Hornet was developed in honour of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan . 
 = St. Elmo ( 1914 film ) = 
 St. Elmo is a 1914 American silent drama film produced by the Balboa Amusement Producing Company and distributed by William Fox 's Box Office Attractions Company . It was the first feature @-@ length film adaptation of Augusta Jane Evans 's 1866 eponymous novel . The story follows the life of the title character ( played by William Jossey ) , who kills his cousin ( Francis McDonald ) over the love of Agnes ( Madeline Pardee ) , falls from grace , and eventually finds redemption and love with Edna ( Gypsy Abbott ) . It is disputed who directed the film ; many sources credit Bertram Bracken , while others list St. Elmo as J. Gordon Edwards 's directorial debut . 
 Some reviewers praised the scenery and overall production quality , considering the film an improvement over stage adaptations of the novel . Others found the scenery irrelevant and the story confusing . Despite mixed reviews , the film was financially successful , reportedly setting box office records . The following year , a film adaptation of an unrelated Evans novel , Beulah , was marketed as a sequel . As with most Balboa films , St. Elmo is now believed lost . 
 = = Plot = = 
 St. Elmo and Murray Hammond , his cousin and best friend , are both in love with a young woman named Agnes Hunt . Although Agnes loves Murray , she rejects him for being too poor . Instead , she accepts the wealthy St. Elmo 's marriage proposal . St. Elmo 's mother holds a ball to celebrate the engagement . After the betrothal is publicly announced , Murray and Agnes meet covertly in the gardens . St. Elmo discovers their affair , challenges Murray to a duel , and kills his cousin with the first shot . The Devil possesses St. Elmo , and he becomes a cruel wanderer , spreading misery and misfortune where he travels . 
 Twenty years later , the ingenue Edna Earle is traveling by train , hoping to find employment in a cotton mill after the death of her father , the village blacksmith . The train derails , and St. Elmo saves her from the burning wreckage . This act sets St. Elmo on the path to salvation as he and Edna slowly fall in love . Initially planning to depart for distant lands , a vision of Christ leads him to aid the impoverished . Freed from the Devil , he becomes a minister and marries Edna .

 Augusta Jane Evans 's 1866 domestic novel St. Elmo was one of the best @-@ selling novels of the 19th century , surpassed at the time only by Uncle Tom 's Cabin , and later by Ben @-@ Hur : A Tale of the Christ . With the novel 's success came broad cultural impact . Various consumer products , hotels , steamboats , railway carriages , and even several towns were named after the book , and many families named children after its characters . Although there was considerable interest in a theatrical adaptation , Evans was concerned about how the novel 's themes would be portrayed on the stage and did not approve the first script for a St. Elmo play until 1909 . Other stage versions , many of which were financially successful , were quickly developed after her death later that year . The first film versions of the story followed shortly . In 1910 , the Thanhouser Company chose St. Elmo for its second production , and Vitagraph Studios produced its own adaptation the same year . Both were one @-@ reel short films . 
 In 1914 , while working for the Balboa Amusement Producing Company , William Jossey wrote the screenplay for the first feature @-@ length film adaptation . Filming took place in Long Beach , California , where the Balboa studios were located . Footage of an actual church under construction across the street from the studio was used for a scene in which one was built by St. Elmo . Contemporary writers credited Bertram Bracken as director , as do some modern sources , including the American Film Institute . Others consider the film the directorial debut of J. Gordon Edwards . Both men subsequently had long careers directing for Fox Film . 
 Balboa highlighted the film 's production value and artistry in its marketing ; its film poster advertises " 194 gorgeous scenes " . However , Balboa was not a film distributor , so in May 1914 they contracted with William Fox 's Box Office Attractions Company to have Fox handle the distribution of all Balboa films , beginning with St. Elmo . Copies of these films were then shown at Fox 's theaters or rented out to other theater franchise owners , in what was known as the states ' rights distribution system . On 1 February 1915 , William Fox incorporated Fox Film , which inherited Box Office 's assets . The new company continued to distribute some Box Office films , including St. Elmo , which played in some areas into 1916 . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Contemporary reviews were mixed . Writing for Motion Picture News , A. Danson Michell found the film superior to stage adaptations of the novel , and especially praised the photography . Moving Picture World 's Hanford Judson also gave a generally positive review , believing that its production qualities and popular appeal more than compensated for the " artificiality " of a few scenes . Not all critics praised the film . Vanderheyden Fyles of Movie Pictorial felt the Long Beach scenery lauded elsewhere was irrelevant to the plot and the adapted story was a " baffling mix @-@ up " . A particularly negative review appeared in Variety , suggesting the film was so bad that its makers " might have got a little profit out of the raw [ film ] by not ruining it through putting St. Elmo on it . " The Chicago Board of Censorship found some scenes objectionable and required that Chicago showings of the film be edited to remove depictions of dueling and Murray 's dead body . 
 St. Elmo was a financial success , reported by The <unk> ' Weekly as breaking box office records . The following year , Bertram Bracken directed a film adaptation of another Augusta Jane Evans novel , Beulah ( 1859 ) , for Balboa . Though not directly related to St. Elmo , the 1915 Beulah film was marketed as a sequel . In 1923 , Fox Film produced another adaptation of the novel , also titled St. Elmo , which was also a success . 
 Around 90 % of Balboa 's films have been lost , probably including the 1914 St. Elmo . The Library of Congress is not aware of any extant copies .

 Shambhala : Expedición al Himalaya ( simply known as Shambhala ) is a steel Hyper Coaster roller coaster located at the PortAventura amusement park in <unk> , Catalonia , Spain . Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard , it is the tallest ( 78 metres ( 256 ft ) ) and fastest hypercoaster ( 134 kilometres per hour ( 83 mph ) ) in Europe . It also has the longest drop of any roller coaster in the continent ( 78 metres ( 256 ft ) ) . Shambhala is named and themed after the inaccessible land in the Himalayas ; Shambhala . It was announced to the public on October 24 , 2011 , and opened to the public on May 12 , 2012 .

 Rumors that PortAventura would be investing in a new Bolliger & Mabillard Flying Coaster or Dive Coaster roller coaster emerged in late 2010 . In May 2011 , speculation that the park was planning to build a hypercoaster that would pass over Dragon Khan arose . Land clearing also began in the summer of 2011 . Shambhala was announced to the public on October 24 , 2011 ; the layout of the roller coaster was leaked 2 days earlier . The last piece of track was installed in mid @-@ April 2012 following a signing event and the placement of the several country flags on the track . Testing of the ride began in the same month . Following the completion of testing , a ribbon cutting ceremony was held on May 12 , 2012 before opening to the public the same day . Over 300 workers from countries such as Germany , France , Hungary , Poland , Switzerland , and United States of America took part in the construction of Shambhala . 
 The roller coaster currently holds three records ; tallest , longest drop , and fastest hypercoaster in Europe . All three records were held by Silver Star at Europa @-@ Park prior to Shambhala 's opening .

 After departing from the station , the train makes a 90 degree turn to the right , then begins to climb the 76 @-@ metre ( 249 ft ) tall chain lift hill . Once the train reaches the top of the lift , the train drops back down to the ground on an 77 @.@ 4 degree angle reaching speeds of up to 134 kilometres per hour ( 83 mph ) as it passes through a tunnel . Following the first drop , the train then makes a slight left turn into the first of five camelback hills before dropping again and entering a figure @-@ 8 @-@ like helix . Next , the train goes over a small hill ; at the same time , passing through a trim brake . Immediately after , the train enters the second camelback hill , followed by a slight left turn into an element that is similar to a splashdown as the track crosses under Dragon Khan . After going over the third and fourth camelback hills , the train passing through the mid @-@ course brake run . Finally , after making a banked downward left turn , the train passes over the final camelback hill before entering the final brake run leading directly back to the station where the next riders board .

 Following the opening of Shambhala , <unk> & Parks magazine named the roller coaster as the best European attraction introduced in 2012 . Patrick Purcell from Mirror said that the roller coaster lived up to its hype and that , " It is also one of the smoothest roller coasters I 've encountered . " Sophie Castle from Travel Channel UK praised the height of Shambhala and said that , " Shambhala is definitely an opportunity that shouldn ’ t be missed . " Ethan Williams from the Daily Mail gave the roller coaster a five out of five for its speed , surprise factor , and fear factor . He also liked the amount of airtime the roller coaster gave . In 2013 , Shambhala was featured on Travel Channel 's television series Insane Coaster Wars : World Domination . 
 Also , the ride entered Mitch Hawker 's Best Roller Coaster Poll at 6 in 2012 before dropping to 8 in 2013 as shown in the table below .

 = Maryland Route 18 = 
 Maryland Route 18 ( MD 18 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . The state highway runs 20 @.@ 37 miles ( 32 @.@ 78 km ) from the beginning of state maintenance at Love Point east to MD 213 in Centreville . MD 18 is the main east – west local highway on Kent Island and east to Centreville , serving the centers of Stevensville , Chester , Kent Narrows , Grasonville , and Queenstown that are bypassed by U.S. Route 50 and US 301 . What is signed as MD 18 is actually a set of four suffixed highways : MD 18A , MD 18B , MD 18S , and MD 18C . There are also several unsigned segments of MD 18 scattered along the length of the signed portions . 
 What is now MD 18 was first paved in the 1910s from Centreville to Queenstown along with short segments in Grasonville and Chester . Gaps in the Stevensville – Queenstown highway were filled throughout the 1920s , leaving only a crossing of Kent Narrows to be completed in the early 1930s . MD 18 between Stevensville and Love Point was constructed in the early 1930s . The Stevensville – Queenstown highway was designated part of MD 404 , while the highways on both ends to Love Point and Centreville were designated MD 18 . US 50 replaced MD 404 when the former highway was extended east of Annapolis in 1949 . When US 50 was relocated as a divided highway between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Queenstown in the early 1950s , MD 18 was assigned to the bypassed highway . Since the mid @-@ 1980s , several suffixed sections of MD 18 have been created , relocated , or received new designations due to expansion of US 50 and US 301 to a freeway . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The mainline of MD 18 consists of four internally suffixed sections . MD 18A runs 5 @.@ 39 miles ( 8 @.@ 67 km ) from Love Point south and east through Stevensville to a roundabout at Castle Marina Road in Chester . MD 18B extends 7 @.@ 94 miles ( 12 @.@ 78 km ) from the same roundabout east through Chester , Kent Narrows , and Grasonville to US 50 in Queenstown . MD 18S has a length of 0 @.@ 33 miles ( 0 @.@ 53 km ) between US 50 and US 301 in Queenstown . MD 18C comprises the easternmost 6 @.@ 71 miles ( 10 @.@ 80 km ) of the highway from US 301 in Queenstown to MD 213 in Centreville . 
 MD 18A 's western terminus is at the beginning of state maintenance on Love Point Road just south of the community of Love Point at the northern end of Kent Island . The state highway heads due south through farmland . After meeting Old Love Point Road at an acute angle , MD 18A passes suburban subdivisions and Kent Island High School . Love Point Road , which is unsigned MD 835C , veers southeast to pass through the Stevensville Historic District , which contains the historic Cray House , the Stevensville Bank building , and Christ Church . MD 18A curves to the southwest as Business Parkway . The state highway expands to a four @-@ lane divided highway ahead of the intersection with MD 8 . MD 8 continues south on the divided highway toward an interchange with US 50 and US 301 ( Blue Star Memorial Highway ) just east of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge while MD 18A turns east onto Main Street . MD 18A curves around the southern edge of the Stevensville Historic District , intersecting Love Point Road , which is unsigned MD <unk> to the south , and the other end of MD 835C ( East Main Street ) . The state highway passes Stevensville Middle School , crosses Cox Creek , and passes the Kent Island Shopping Center before reaching its eastern terminus at a roundabout with Castle Marina Road , which is unsigned MD 18H to the south . 
 MD 18B begins at the same roundabout at which MD 18A has its eastern terminus . Piney Creek Road , which is unsigned MD 18T , splits to the east as MD 18B curves southeast and crosses over US 50 and US 301 . The state highway curves east again at an intersection with its old alignment , Postal Road , in Chester shortly before an intersection with MD 552 ( Dominion Road ) . MD 18B continues around the south end of Piney Creek before entering the hamlet of Kent Narrows , where the highway has a direct connection to eastbound US 50 and US 301 . The state highway also has an indirect connection to the westbound freeway via Piney Narrows Road immediately before crossing Kent Narrows on a drawbridge adjacent to the US 50 and US 301 crossing of the strait . MD 18B continues east through Grasonville , where the highway intersects Chester River Beach Road ( unsigned MD 18V ) and Nesbit Road ( unsigned MD <unk> ) , both of which provide full access to the freeway . The state highway continues through farmland before reaching its eastern terminus at US 50 ( Ocean Gateway ) just east of the US 50 – US 301 split in Queenstown . The two highways meet at a superstreet intersection , so there is no direct access between MD 18B and MD 18S on the opposite side of the intersection . 
 MD 18S begins at US 50 opposite MD 18B 's eastern terminus . At the intersection with MD 656 ( <unk> Road ) and Outlet Center Drive , which heads into the Queenstown Premium Outlets , the state highway turns north and reaches its eastern terminus at a superstreet intersection with US 301 ( Blue Star Memorial Highway ) . MD 18C begins at US 301 opposite the eastern terminus of MD 18S . The state highway heads northeast as Main Street through the town of Queenstown , where the highway intersects MD 456 ( Del Rhodes Avenue ) and passes near the historic home <unk> . After leaving the town , MD 18C 's name changes to 4 @-@ H Park Road and the road passes through farmland . The state highway passes the namesake park of the youth agricultural organization shortly after crossing Reed Creek . MD 18C passes by the historic home Bachelor 's Hope before the highway reaches its eastern terminus at MD 213 ( Centreville Road ) on the southwestern edge of Centreville .

 The first sections of MD 18 was paved as three separate state @-@ aid roads within Queenstown and Grasonville by 1915 , and between Stevensville and Chester shortly after 1915 . The first section paved as a state road was between Centreville and Queenstown by 1919 ; there were also short pieces of state road paved in Chester and east of Grasonville by 1921 . The state road in Chester was extended east to Kent Narrows and the state road near Grasonville was extended west through the village in 1923 . The Stevensville – Chester road and the Queenstown – Centreville road were marked as MD 18 by 1927 . The road from Stevensville to Love Point was started in 1929 and completed to just south of Love Point in 1930 . The highway was extended to its present western terminus by 1933 . Pavement was also laid from the west end of Grasonville to Kent Narrows by 1930 . The east – west highway between Stevensville and Queenstown was finished with the completion of a timber trestle bascule bridge over Kent Narrows . That highway was marked as MD 404 in 1933 ; the highways from Stevensville to Love Point and from Queenstown to Centreville remained marked as MD 18 . 
 When US 50 was extended to the Eastern Shore in 1949 , it was routed along MD 404 to Wye Mills . The US 50 divided highway started construction in 1950 and was completed between the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Queenstown in 1952 , including a new drawbridge over Kent Narrows . The 1933 bridge over Kent Narrows was dismantled in 1953 . MD 18 was subsequently assigned to old US 50 between Stevensville and Queenstown , following its own alignment except for a concurrency with US 50 and later US 301 over Kent Narrows . 
 Business Parkway was constructed in 1987 as a new alignment and northern extension of MD 8 . MD 18 was extended west to Business Parkway and north on the divided highway to bypass the Stevensville Historic District in 1989 ; the old alignment was designated MD 835C . MD 18 also bypassed the center of Chester in 1989 by the construction of an overpass of US 50 and US 301 just west of MD 552 , replacing the intersection at Castle Marina Road . The latter improvement was part of the transformation of US 50 and US 301 to a freeway from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge to Queenstown , which was completed in 1991 . The upgrade included a new fixed high @-@ level bridge over Kent Narrows for US 50 and US 301 , relegating the 1952 drawbridge to be used only by MD 18 . In 1999 , MD 18 was relocated to the north to use a new roundabout at Castle Marina Road in Chester ; the old mainline was designated MD 18R . The MD 18 – US 301 junction in Queenstown was transformed into a superstreet intersection in 2003 , resulting in the splitting of the MD 18C designation ; MD 18S was assigned to the highway south of the junction . 
 As part of the reconstruction of US 50 as a six @-@ lane freeway from US 301 in Queenstown to MD 404 in Wye Mills , the Maryland State Highway Administration plans to construct an overpass of MD 18 over US 50 in Queenstown . MD 18 and US 50 would become connected by a pair of right @-@ in / right @-@ out interchanges . Access to eastbound US 50 would be via a new service road south of US 50 and connections with westbound US 50 would be made through Outlet Center Drive . As of 2011 , the project has not been funded .

 Little is known about the production or cast of the film despite its survival status . The only known credit cited by Q. David Bowers is that of Marie Eline cast in the role of Marie . The director , scenario writer and cameraman are also unknown . Thanhouser Company Film Preservation states that the dramatic theme of the film was " family disharmony " and it took the expected sentimental approach for the era . Marie who identifies with her grandmother resolves that she is also " Only in the Way " by virtue of being a cripple . The site states , " Thanhouser <unk> seemed to have had a special sensitivity for the feelings of children which is reflected in this film . "

 The single reel film , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet long , was released on January 31 , 1911 . The Billboard praised Marie Eline 's acting also noting the good photography in its review . The Moving Picture World 's review states , " The part played by the grandmother and the one played by the child are both pathetic and cannot fail to touch the heart . The person who can sit through this and not feel the tears welling up to his eyes is strangely callous to human grief and emotion . " The New York Dramatic Mirror was open in its praise of the film and its portrayal of the subject through good acting , but it also noted the technical faults with film continuity . The reviewer wrote , " It was noticed that the old lady 's bag was brought on immediately , already packed , when she left the son 's house and when she left the home . It looks planned beforehand – similar incidents have hurt the excellence of a number of this company 's superior films . It would take time in life , and a split in the film would have done it . Such things spoil the illusion to a spectator . " 
 Walton of The Moving Picture News , who typically praised Thanhouser films , deviated from the norm by immediately dismissing the film as a whole by stating , " This theme is getting threadbare ; a foreign film is almost identical . The son 's wife acts brutally to her husband 's mother ; things are set right by a child . Compare Gaumont 's Twilight of a Soldier 's Life , etc . The acting of the child is charming , and of the old lady a womanly concept – even to details . The wife 's grabbing the old lady 's bag , umbrella , etc. was , as one said who sat next to me , ' a bit too rushed . ' " This criticism of the theme was accurate because the Gaumont Film Company release had a nearly identical plot except that that " grandma " was an elderly soldier . The similarities between the two films likely are coincidental because the Gaumont film was released four days prior . 
 Q. David Bowers wrote a modern synopsis of the production which contains more details than the official publication from the Thanhouser company . Bowers was present for the showing of this film at Iona College in New Rochelle on October 7 , 1988 and stated that the film was met with cheers by an audience of about 400 persons . 
 A print of the film is preserved in the Library of Congress . 
 = Ganymede ( moon ) = 
 Ganymede / <unk> / ( Jupiter III ) is the largest moon of Jupiter and in the Solar System , and the only moon known to have a magnetic field . It is the seventh satellite outward from Jupiter and third of the Galilean moons , the first group of objects discovered orbiting another planet . Ganymede orbits Jupiter in roughly seven days and is in a 1 : 2 : 4 orbital resonance with the moons Europa and Io , respectively . Ganymede has a diameter of 5 @,@ 268 km ( 3 @,@ 273 mi ) , 8 % larger than the planet Mercury , but its mass is only 45 % that of Mercury . Ganymede is 2 % larger than Saturn 's Titan , the Solar System 's second @-@ largest moon . At 2 @.@ 02 times the mass of the Moon , it is the most massive planetary satellite . It is the ninth @-@ largest object in the Solar System , and the largest without a substantial atmosphere . 
 Ganymede is composed of approximately equal amounts of silicate rock and water ice . It is a fully differentiated body with an iron @-@ rich , liquid core , and an internal ocean that may contain more water than all of Earth 's oceans combined . Its surface is composed of two main types of terrain . Dark regions , saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years ago , cover about a third of the satellite . Lighter regions , crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges and only slightly less ancient , cover the remainder . The cause of the light terrain 's disrupted geology is not fully known , but was likely the result of tectonic activity brought about by tidal heating . 
 Ganymede 's magnetic field was probably created through convection within its liquid iron core . The meager magnetic field is buried within Jupiter 's much larger magnetic field and would show only as a local perturbation of the field lines . The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O , O2 , and possibly O3 ( ozone ) . Atomic hydrogen is a minor atmospheric constituent . Whether the satellite has an ionosphere associated with its atmosphere is unresolved . 
 Ganymede 's discovery is credited to Galileo Galilei , who was the first to observe it on January 7 , 1610 . The satellite 's name was soon suggested by astronomer Simon Marius , for the mythological Ganymede , cupbearer of the Greek gods and Zeus 's lover . Beginning with Pioneer 10 , spacecraft have been able to examine Ganymede closely . The Voyager probes refined measurements of its size , whereas the Galileo craft discovered its underground ocean and magnetic field . The next planned mission to the Jovian system is the European Space Agency 's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer ( JUICE ) , due to launch in 2022 . After flybys of all three icy Galilean moons , the probe is planned to enter orbit around Ganymede . 
 = = History = = 
 Chinese astronomical records report that in 365 BC , Gan De detected what appears to have been a moon of Jupiter , probably Ganymede , with the naked eye . 
 On January 7 , 1610 , Galileo Galilei observed what he thought were three stars near Jupiter , including what turned out to be Ganymede , Callisto , and one body that turned out to be the combined light from Io and Europa ; the next night he noticed that they had moved . On January 13 , he saw all four at once for the first time , but had seen each of the moons before this date at least once . By January 15 , Galileo came to the conclusion that the stars were actually bodies orbiting Jupiter . He claimed the right to name the moons ; he considered " <unk> Stars " and settled on " Medicean Stars " . 
 The French astronomer Nicolas @-@ Claude Fabri de Peiresc suggested individual names from the Medici family for the moons , but his proposal was not taken up . Simon Marius , who had originally claimed to have found the Galilean satellites , tried to name the moons the " Saturn of Jupiter " , the " Jupiter of Jupiter " ( this was Ganymede ) , the " Venus of Jupiter " , and the " Mercury of Jupiter " , another nomenclature that never caught on . From a suggestion by Johannes Kepler , Marius once again tried to name the moons : 
 “ [ … ] Then there was Ganymede , the handsome son of King Tros , whom Jupiter , having taken the form of an eagle , transported to heaven on his back , as poets fabulously tell [ … ] the Third , on account of its majesty of light , Ganymede [ … ] ” 
 This name and those of the other Galilean satellites fell into disfavor for a considerable time , and were not in common use until the mid @-@ 20th century . In much of the earlier astronomical literature , Ganymede is referred to instead by its Roman numeral designation ( a system introduced by Galileo ) as Jupiter III or as the " third satellite of Jupiter " . Following the discovery of moons of Saturn , a naming system based on that of Kepler and Marius was used for Jupiter 's moons . Ganymede is the only Galilean moon of Jupiter named after a male figure — like Io , Europa , and Callisto , he was a lover of Zeus . 
 = = Orbit and rotation = = 
 Ganymede orbits Jupiter at a distance of 1 @,@ 070 @,@ 400 km , third among the Galilean satellites , and completes a revolution every seven days and three hours . Like most known moons , Ganymede is tidally locked , with one side always facing toward the planet . Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator , with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi @-@ periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries . The ranges of change are 0 @.@ <unk> – 0 @.@ 0022 and 0 @.@ 05 – 0 @.@ 32 ° , respectively . These orbital variations cause the axial tilt ( the angle between rotational and orbital axes ) to vary between 0 and 0 @.@ 33 ° . 
 Ganymede participates in orbital resonances with Europa and Io : for every orbit of Ganymede , Europa orbits twice and Io orbits four times . The superior conjunction between Io and Europa always occurs when Io is at periapsis and Europa at apoapsis . The superior conjunction between Europa and Ganymede occurs when Europa is at periapsis . The longitudes of the Io – Europa and Europa – Ganymede conjunctions change with the same rate , making the triple conjunctions impossible . Such a complicated resonance is called the Laplace resonance . 
 The current Laplace resonance is unable to pump the orbital eccentricity of Ganymede to a higher value . The value of about 0 @.@ 0013 is probably a remnant from a previous epoch , when such pumping was possible . The Ganymedian orbital eccentricity is somewhat puzzling ; if it is not pumped now it should have decayed long ago due to the tidal dissipation in the interior of Ganymede . This means that the last episode of the eccentricity excitation happened only several hundred million years ago . Because Ganymede 's orbital eccentricity is relatively low — on average 0 @.@ 0015 — tidal heating is negligible now . However , in the past Ganymede may have passed through one or more Laplace @-@ like resonances that were able to pump the orbital eccentricity to a value as high as 0 @.@ 01 – 0 @.@ 02 . This probably caused a significant tidal heating of the interior of Ganymede ; the formation of the grooved terrain may be a result of one or more heating episodes . 
 There are two hypotheses for the origin of the Laplace resonance among Io , Europa , and Ganymede : that it is primordial and has existed from the beginning of the Solar System ; or that it developed after the formation of the Solar System . A possible sequence of events for the latter scenario is as follows : Io raised tides on Jupiter , causing its orbit to expand until it encountered the 2 : 1 resonance with Europa ; after that the expansion continued , but some of the angular moment was transferred to Europa as the resonance caused its orbit to expand as well ; the process continued until Europa encountered the 2 : 1 resonance with Ganymede . Eventually the drift rates of conjunctions between all three moons were synchronized and locked in the Laplace resonance . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 The average density of Ganymede , 1 @.@ 936 g / cm3 , suggests a composition of approximately equal parts rocky material and water , which is mainly in the form of ice . The mass fraction of ices is between 46 – 50 % , slightly lower than that in Callisto . Some additional volatile ices such as ammonia may also be present . The exact composition of Ganymede 's rock is not known , but is probably close to the composition of L / LL type ordinary chondrites , which are characterized by less total iron , less metallic iron and more iron oxide than H chondrites . The weight ratio of iron to silicon is 1 @.@ 05 – 1 @.@ 27 in Ganymede , whereas the solar ratio is around 1 @.@ 8 . 
 Ganymede 's surface has an albedo of about 43 % . Water ice seems to be ubiquitous on the surface , with a mass fraction of 50 – 90 % , significantly more than in Ganymede as a whole . Near @-@ infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of strong water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1 @.@ 04 , 1 @.@ 25 , 1 @.@ 5 , 2 @.@ 0 and 3 @.@ 0 μm . The grooved terrain is brighter and has more icy composition than the dark terrain . The analysis of high @-@ resolution , near @-@ infrared and <unk> obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from the ground has revealed various non @-@ water materials : carbon dioxide , sulfur dioxide and , possibly , cyanogen , hydrogen sulfate and various organic compounds . Galileo results have also shown magnesium sulfate ( MgSO4 ) and , possibly , sodium sulfate ( Na2SO4 ) on Ganymede 's surface . These salts may originate from the subsurface ocean . 
 The Ganymedian surface is asymmetric ; the leading hemisphere is brighter than the trailing one . This is similar to Europa , but the reverse is true for Callisto . The trailing hemisphere of Ganymede appears to be enriched in sulfur dioxide . The distribution of carbon dioxide does not demonstrate any hemispheric asymmetry , although it is not observed near the poles . Impact craters on Ganymede ( except one ) do not show any enrichment in carbon dioxide , which also distinguishes it from Callisto . Ganymede 's carbon dioxide gas was probably depleted in the past . 
 = = = Internal structure = = = 
 Ganymede appears to be fully differentiated , consisting of an iron @-@ sulfide – iron core and a silicate mantle . The precise thicknesses of the different layers in the interior of Ganymede depend on the assumed composition of silicates ( fraction of olivine and pyroxene ) and amount of sulfur in the core . 
 = = = = Subsurface oceans = = = = 
 In the 1970s , NASA scientists first suspected that Ganymede has a thick ocean between two layers of ice , one on the top and one on the bottom . In the 1990s , NASA 's Galileo mission flew by Ganymede , confirming the moon 's ocean . An analysis published in 2014 , taking into account the realistic thermodynamics for water and effects of salt , suggests that Ganymede might have a stack of several ocean layers separated by different phases of ice , with the lowest liquid layer adjacent to the rocky mantle below . Water – rock contact may be an important factor in the origin of life . The analysis also notes that the extreme depths involved ( ~ 800 km to the rocky " seafloor " ) mean that temperatures at the bottom of a convective ( adiabatic ) ocean can be up to 40 K higher than those at the ice – water interface . In March 2015 , scientists reported how measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope showed that Ganymede has a subsurface ocean by studying how the aurorae moved over Ganymede 's surface . A large salt @-@ water ocean affects Ganymede 's magnetic field , and consequently , its aurora . 
 There is some speculation on the potential habitability of Ganymede 's ocean . 
 = = = = Core = = = = 
 Ganymede has the lowest moment of inertia factor among the solid Solar System bodies . The existence of a liquid , iron – nickel @-@ rich core provides a natural explanation for the intrinsic magnetic field of Ganymede detected by Galileo spacecraft . The convection in the liquid iron , which has high electrical conductivity , is the most reasonable model of magnetic field generation . The density of the core is 5 @.@ 5 – 6 g / cm3 and the silicate mantle is 3 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 6 g / cm3 . The radius of this core may be up to 500 km . The temperature in the core of Ganymede is probably 1500 – 1700 K and pressure up to 10 GPa . 
 = = = Surface features = = = 
 Ganymede 's surface is a mix of two types of terrain : very old , highly cratered , dark regions and somewhat younger ( but still ancient ) , lighter regions marked with an extensive array of grooves and ridges . The dark terrain , which comprises about one @-@ third of the surface , contains clays and organic materials that could indicate the composition of the impactors from which Jovian satellites accreted . 
 The heating mechanism required for the formation of the grooved terrain on Ganymede is an unsolved problem in the planetary sciences . The modern view is that the grooved terrain is mainly tectonic in nature . Cryovolcanism is thought to have played only a minor role , if any . The forces that caused the strong stresses in the Ganymedian ice lithosphere necessary to initiate the tectonic activity may be connected to the tidal heating events in the past , possibly caused when the satellite passed through unstable orbital resonances . The tidal flexing of the ice may have heated the interior and strained the lithosphere , leading to the development of cracks and horst and graben faulting , which erased the old , dark terrain on 70 % of the surface . The formation of the grooved terrain may also be connected with the early core formation and subsequent tidal heating of Ganymede 's interior , which may have caused a slight expansion of Ganymede by 1 – 6 % due to phase transitions in ice and thermal expansion . During subsequent evolution deep , hot water plumes may have risen from the core to the surface , leading to the tectonic deformation of the lithosphere . <unk> heating within the satellite is the most relevant current heat source , contributing , for instance , to ocean depth . Research models have found that if the orbital eccentricity were an order of magnitude greater than currently ( as it may have been in the past ) , tidal heating would be a more substantial heat source than radiogenic heating . 
 Cratering is seen on both types of terrain , but is especially extensive on the dark terrain : it appears to be saturated with impact craters and has evolved largely through impact events . The brighter , grooved terrain contains many fewer impact features , which have been only of a minor importance to its tectonic evolution . The density of cratering indicates an age of 4 billion years for the dark terrain , similar to the highlands of the Moon , and a somewhat younger age for the grooved terrain ( but how much younger is uncertain ) . Ganymede may have experienced a period of heavy cratering 3 @.@ 5 to 4 billion years ago similar to that of the Moon . If true , the vast majority of impacts happened in that epoch , whereas the cratering rate has been much smaller since . Craters both overlay and are crosscut by the groove systems , indicating that some of the grooves are quite ancient . Relatively young craters with rays of ejecta are also visible . Ganymedian craters are flatter than those on the Moon and Mercury . This is probably due to the relatively weak nature of Ganymede 's icy crust , which can ( or could ) flow and thereby soften the relief . Ancient craters whose relief has disappeared leave only a " ghost " of a crater known as a palimpsest . 
 One significant feature on Ganymede is a dark plain named Galileo Regio , which contains a series of concentric grooves , or furrows , likely created during a period of geologic activity . 
 Ganymede also has polar caps , likely composed of water frost . The frost extends to 40 ° latitude . These polar caps were first seen by the Voyager spacecraft . Theories on the formation of the caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma . Data from Galileo suggests the latter is correct . The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions ; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules , with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain . 
 A crater named Anat provides the reference point for measuring longitude on Ganymede . By definition , Anat is at 128 ° longitude . The 0 ° longitude directly faces Jupiter , and unless stated otherwise longitude increases toward the west . 
 = = = Atmosphere and ionosphere = = = 
 In 1972 , a team of Indian , British and American astronomers working in Java ( Indonesia ) and <unk> ( India ) claimed that they had detected a thin atmosphere during an occultation , when it and Jupiter passed in front of a star . They estimated that the surface pressure was around 0 @.@ 1 Pa . However , in 1979 , Voyager 1 observed an occultation of the star κ Centauri during its flyby of Jupiter , with differing results . The occultation measurements were conducted in the far @-@ ultraviolet spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 200 nm , which were much more sensitive to the presence of gases than the 1972 measurements in the visible spectrum . No atmosphere was revealed by the Voyager data . The upper limit on the surface particle number density was found to be 1 @.@ 5 × 109 cm − 3 , which corresponds to a surface pressure of less than 2 @.@ 5 µPa . The latter value is almost five orders of magnitude less than the 1972 estimate . 
 Despite the Voyager data , evidence for a tenuous oxygen atmosphere ( exosphere ) on Ganymede , very similar to the one found on Europa , was found by the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) in 1995 . HST actually observed airglow of atomic oxygen in the far @-@ ultraviolet at the wavelengths 130 @.@ 4 nm and 135 @.@ 6 nm . Such an airglow is excited when molecular oxygen is dissociated by electron impacts , evidence of a significant neutral atmosphere composed predominantly of O2 molecules . The surface number density probably lies in the ( 1 @.@ 2 – 7 ) × 108 cm − 3 range , corresponding to the surface pressure of 0 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 2 µPa . These values are in agreement with the Voyager 's upper limit set in 1981 . The oxygen is not evidence of life ; it is thought to be produced when water ice on Ganymede 's surface is split into hydrogen and oxygen by radiation , with the hydrogen then being more rapidly lost due to its low atomic mass . The airglow observed over Ganymede is not spatially homogeneous like that over Europa . HST observed two bright spots located in the northern and southern hemispheres , near ± 50 ° latitude , which is exactly the boundary between the open and closed field lines of the Ganymedian magnetosphere ( see below ) . The bright spots are probably polar auroras , caused by plasma precipitation along the open field lines . 
 The existence of a neutral atmosphere implies that an ionosphere should exist , because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic electrons coming from the magnetosphere and by solar <unk> radiation . However , the nature of the Ganymedian ionosphere is as controversial as the nature of the atmosphere . Some Galileo measurements found an elevated electron density near Ganymede , suggesting an ionosphere , whereas others failed to detect anything . The electron density near the surface is estimated by different sources to lie in the range 400 – 2 @,@ 500 cm − 3 . As of 2008 , the parameters of the ionosphere of Ganymede are not well constrained . 
 Additional evidence of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede . The detection of ozone ( O3 ) bands was announced in 1996 . In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer ( or diatomic ) absorption features of molecular oxygen . Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase . The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice . The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on latitude and longitude , rather than on surface albedo — they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede , whereas O3 shows an opposite trend . Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede 's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K ( − 173 @.@ 15 ° C ) . 
 A search for sodium in the atmosphere , just after such a finding on Europa , turned up nothing in 1997 . Sodium is at least 13 times less abundant around Ganymede than around Europa , possibly because of a relative deficiency at the surface or because the magnetosphere fends off energetic particles . Another minor constituent of the Ganymedian atmosphere is atomic hydrogen . Hydrogen atoms were observed as far as 3 @,@ 000 km from Ganymede 's surface . Their density on the surface is about 1 @.@ 5 × 104 cm − 3 . 
 = = = Magnetosphere = = = 
 The Galileo craft made six close flybys of Ganymede from 1995 – 2000 ( G1 , G2 , G7 , G8 , <unk> and G29 ) and discovered that Ganymede has a permanent ( intrinsic ) magnetic moment independent of the Jovian magnetic field . The value of the moment is about 1 @.@ 3 × 1013 T · m3 , which is three times larger than the magnetic moment of Mercury . The magnetic dipole is tilted with respect to the rotational axis of Ganymede by 176 ° , which means that it is directed against the Jovian magnetic moment . Its north pole lies below the orbital plane . The dipole magnetic field created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 ± 2 nT at Ganymede 's equator , which should be compared with the Jovian magnetic field at the distance of Ganymede — about 120 nT . The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the Jovian field , meaning reconnection is possible . The intrinsic field strength at the poles is two times that at the equator — 1440 nT . 
 The permanent magnetic moment carves a part of space around Ganymede , creating a tiny magnetosphere embedded inside that of Jupiter ; it is the only moon in the Solar System known to possess the feature . Its diameter is 4 – 5 RG ( RG = 2 @,@ 631 @.@ 2 km ) . The Ganymedian magnetosphere has a region of closed field lines located below 30 ° latitude , where charged particles ( electrons and ions ) are trapped , creating a kind of radiation belt . The main ion species in the magnetosphere is single ionized oxygen — O + — which fits well with Ganymede 's tenuous oxygen atmosphere . In the polar cap regions , at latitudes higher than 30 ° , magnetic field lines are open , connecting Ganymede with Jupiter 's ionosphere . In these areas , the energetic ( tens and hundreds of <unk> ) electrons and ions have been detected , which may cause the auroras observed around the Ganymedian poles . In addition , heavy ions continuously precipitate on Ganymede 's polar surface , sputtering and darkening the ice . 
 The interaction between the Ganymedian magnetosphere and Jovian plasma is in many respects similar to that of the solar wind and Earth 's magnetosphere . The plasma co @-@ rotating with Jupiter impinges on the trailing side of the Ganymedian magnetosphere much like the solar wind impinges on the Earth 's magnetosphere . The main difference is the speed of plasma flow — supersonic in the case of Earth and subsonic in the case of Ganymede . Because of the subsonic flow , there is no bow shock off the trailing hemisphere of Ganymede . 
 In addition to the intrinsic magnetic moment , Ganymede has an induced dipole magnetic field . Its existence is connected with the variation of the Jovian magnetic field near Ganymede . The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following the direction of the varying part of the planetary magnetic field . The induced magnetic moment is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one . The field strength of the induced field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT — half of that of the ambient Jovian field . The induced magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa , indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity . 
 Given that Ganymede is completely differentiated and has a metallic core , its intrinsic magnetic field is probably generated in a similar fashion to the Earth 's : as a result of conducting material moving in the interior . The magnetic field detected around Ganymede is likely to be caused by compositional convection in the core , if the magnetic field is the product of dynamo action , or <unk> . 
 Despite the presence of an iron core , Ganymede 's magnetosphere remains enigmatic , particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature . Some research has suggested that , given its relatively small size , the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions and a magnetic field would not be sustained . One explanation is that the same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist : with Ganymede 's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating increased during such resonances , the mantle may have insulated the core , preventing it from cooling . Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle , which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo @-@ generated field in the past . 
 = = Origin and evolution = = 
 Ganymede probably formed by an accretion in Jupiter 's subnebula , a disk of gas and dust surrounding Jupiter after its formation . The accretion of Ganymede probably took about 10 @,@ 000 years , much shorter than the 100 @,@ 000 years estimated for Callisto . The Jovian subnebula may have been relatively " gas @-@ starved " when the Galilean satellites formed ; this would have allowed for the lengthy accretion times required for Callisto . In contrast Ganymede formed closer to Jupiter , where the subnebula was denser , which explains its shorter formation timescale . This relatively fast formation prevented the escape of accretional heat , which may have led to ice melt and differentiation : the separation of the rocks and ice . The rocks settled to the center , forming the core . In this respect , Ganymede is different from Callisto , which apparently failed to melt and differentiate early due to loss of the accretional heat during its slower formation . This hypothesis explains why the two Jovian moons look so dissimilar , despite their similar mass and composition . Alternative theories explain Ganymede 's greater internal heating on the basis of tidal flexing or more intense pummeling by impactors during the Late Heavy Bombardment . 
 After formation , Ganymede 's core largely retained the heat accumulated during accretion and differentiation , only slowly releasing it to the ice mantle . The mantle , in turn , transported it to the surface by convection . The decay of radioactive elements within rocks further heated the core , causing increased differentiation : an inner , iron – iron @-@ sulfide core and a silicate mantle formed . With this , Ganymede became a fully differentiated body . By comparison , the radioactive heating of undifferentiated Callisto caused convection in its icy interior , which effectively cooled it and prevented large @-@ scale melting of ice and rapid differentiation . The convective motions in Callisto have caused only a partial separation of rock and ice . Today , Ganymede continues to cool slowly . The heat being released from its core and silicate mantle enables the subsurface ocean to exist , whereas the slow cooling of the liquid Fe – FeS core causes convection and supports magnetic field generation . The current heat flux out of Ganymede is probably higher than that out of Callisto .

 Several probes flying by or orbiting Jupiter have explored Ganymede more closely , including four flybys in the 1970s , and multiple passes in the 1990s to 2000s . 
 Pioneer 10 approached in 1973 and Pioneer 11 in 1974 , and they returned information about the satellite . This included more specific determination on physical characteristics and resolving features to 400 km ( 250 mi ) on its surface . Pioneer 10 's closest approach was 446 @,@ 250 km . 
 Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were next , passing by Ganymede in 1979 . They refined its size , revealing it was larger than Saturn 's moon Titan , which was previously thought to have been bigger . The grooved terrain was also seen . 
 In 1995 , the Galileo spacecraft entered orbit around Jupiter and between 1996 and 2000 made six close flybys to explore Ganymede . These flybys are G1 , G2 , G7 , G8 , <unk> and G29 . During the closest flyby — G2 — Galileo passed just 264 km from the surface of Ganymede . During a G1 flyby in 1996 , the Ganymedian magnetic field was discovered , while the discovery of the ocean was announced in 2001 . Galileo transmitted a large number of spectral images and discovered several non @-@ ice compounds on the surface of Ganymede . The most recent close observations of Ganymede were made by New Horizons , which recorded topographic and compositional mapping data of Europa and Ganymede during its flyby of Jupiter in 2007 en route to Pluto .

 The Europa Jupiter System Mission ( EJSM ) had a proposed launch date in 2020 , and was a joint NASA and ESA proposal for exploration of many of Jupiter 's moons including Ganymede . In February 2009 it was announced that ESA and NASA had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission . EJSM consisted of the NASA @-@ led Jupiter Europa Orbiter , the ESA @-@ led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter , and possibly a JAXA @-@ led Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter . ESA 's contribution faced funding competition from other ESA projects , but on 2 May 2012 the European part of the mission , renamed Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer ( JUICE ) , obtained a L1 launch slot in 2022 with a Ariane 5 in the ESA 's Cosmic Vision science programme . The spacecraft will orbit Ganymede and conduct multiple flyby investigations of Callisto and Europa . 
 The Russian Space Research Institute is currently evaluating the Ganymede Lander ( GL ) mission , with emphasis on astrobiology . The Ganymede Lander would be a partner mission for <unk> <unk> moon Explorer ( JUICE ) . If selected , it would be launched in 2024 , though this schedule might be revised and aligned with JUICE . 
 A Ganymede orbiter based on the Juno probe was proposed in 2010 for the Planetary Science Decadal Survey . Possible instruments include Medium Resolution Camera , Flux Gate <unk> , Visible / NIR Imaging Spectrometer , Laser Altimeter , Low and High Energy Plasma Packages , Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer , UV Imaging Spectrometer , Radio and Plasma Wave sensor , Narrow Angle Camera , and a Sub @-@ Surface Radar . 
 Another canceled proposal to orbit Ganymede was the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter . It was designed to use nuclear fission for power , ion engine propulsion , and would have studied Ganymede in greater detail than previously . However , the mission was canceled in 2005 because of budget cuts . Another old proposal was called The Grandeur of Ganymede .

 In his early life , Maximus was a civil servant , and an aide to the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius . However , he gave up this life in the political sphere to enter into the monastic life . Maximus had studied diverse schools of philosophy , and certainly what was common for his time , the Platonic dialogues , the works of Aristotle , and numerous later Platonic commentators on Aristotle and Plato , like Plotinus , Porphyry , Iamblichus , and Proclus . When one of his friends began espousing the Christological position known as Monothelitism , Maximus was drawn into the controversy , in which he supported an interpretation of the Chalcedonian formula on the basis of which it was asserted that Jesus had both a human and a divine will . Maximus is venerated in both Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity . He was eventually persecuted for his Christological positions ; following a trial , his tongue and right hand were mutilated . He was then exiled and died on August 13 , 662 in <unk> , Georgia . However , his theology was upheld by the Third Council of Constantinople and he was venerated as a saint soon after his death . He is almost unique among saints in that he has two feast days : the 13th of August and the 21st of January . His title of Confessor means that he suffered for the Christian faith , but was not directly martyred . The Life of the Virgin , the only extant copy of which is in a Georgian translation , is commonly , albeit mistakenly , attributed to him , and is considered to be one of the earliest complete biographies of Mary , the mother of Jesus .

 Very little is known about the details of Maximus ' life prior to his involvement in the theological and political conflicts of the Monothelite controversy . Numerous Maximian scholars call substantial portions of the Maronite biography into question , including Maximus ' birth in Palestine , which was a common seventh century trope to discredit an opponent . Moreover , the exceptional education Maximus evidently received could not have been had in any other part of the Byzantine Empire during that time except for Constantinople , and possibly Caesarea and Alexandria . It is also very unlikely that anyone of low social birth , as the Maronite biography describes Maximus , could have ascended by the age of thirty to be the <unk> of the Emperor Heraclius , one of the most powerful positions in the Empire . It is more likely that Maximus was born of an aristocratic family and received an unparalleled education in philosophy , mathematics , astronomy , etc . It is true , however , that Maximus did not study rhetoric as he himself notes in the prologue to his Earlier <unk> to John , to which his lack of high stylistic by Byzantine standards attests . Nevertheless , for reasons not explained in the few autobiographical details to be gleaned from his texts , Maximus left public life and took monastic vows at the monastery of Philippicus in Chrysopolis , a city across the Bosporus from Constantinople ( later known as Scutari , the modern Turkish city of Üsküdar ) . Maximus was elevated to the position of abbot of the monastery . " Theology without practice is the theology of demons " . ( One of his most famous quotes ) 
 When the Persians conquered Anatolia , Maximus was forced to flee to a monastery near Carthage . It was there that he came under the tutelage of Saint <unk> , and began studying in detail with him the Christological writings of Gregory of Nazianzus and Dionysius the Areopagite . Maximus continued his career as a theological and spiritual writer while his lengthy stay in Carthage . Maximus was also held in very high esteem by the exarch Gregory , the <unk> George and the population as a holy man , ostensibly becoming an influential unofficial political advisor and spiritual head in North Africa . 
 = = = Involvement in Monothelite controversy = = = 
 While Maximus was in Carthage , a controversy broke out regarding how to understand the interaction between the human and divine natures within the person of Jesus . This Christological debate was the latest development in disagreements that began following the First Council of Nicaea in 325 , and were intensified following the Council of Chalcedon in 451 . The Monothelite position was developed as a compromise between the <unk> and the <unk> , who believed <unk> is conceptually indistinguishable from Nestorianism . The <unk> adhered to the Chalcedonian definition of the <unk> union : that two natures , one divine and one human , were united in the person of Christ . However , they went on to say that Christ had only a divine will and no human will ( Monothelite is derived from the Greek for " one will " ) , which led some to charge them with <unk> <unk> . 
 The Monothelite position was promulgated by Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople and by Maximus ' friend and successor as the Abbot of Chrysopolis , Pyrrhus . Following the death of Sergius in 638 , Pyrrhus succeeded him as Patriarch , but was shortly deposed due to political circumstances . During Pyrrhus ' exile from Constantinople , Maximus and the deposed Patriarch held a public debate on the issue of Monothelitism . In the debate , which was held in the presence of many North African bishops , Maximus took the position that Jesus possessed both a human and a divine will . The result of the debate was that Pyrrhus admitted the error of the Monothelite position , and Maximus accompanied him to Rome in 645 . However , on the death of Emperor Heraclius and the ascension of Emperor Constans II , Pyrrhus returned to Constantinople and recanted of his acceptance of the <unk> ( " two wills " ) position . 
 Maximus may have remained in Rome , because he was present when the newly elected Pope Martin I convened the Lateran Council of 649 at the Lateran Basilica in Rome . The 105 bishops present condemned Monothelitism in the official acts of the synod , which some believe may have been written by Maximus . It was in Rome that Pope Martin and Maximus were arrested in 653 under orders from Constans II , who supported the Monothelite doctrine . Pope Martin was condemned without a trial , and died before he could be sent to the Imperial Capital . 
 = = = Trial and exile = = = 
 Maximus ' refusal to accept Monothelitism caused him to be brought to the imperial capital of Constantinople to be tried as a heretic in 658 . In Constantinople , Monothelitism had gained the favor of both the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople . Maximus stood behind the <unk> position and was sent back into exile for four more years . 
 In 662 , Maximus was placed on trial once more , and was once more convicted of heresy . Following the trial Maximus was tortured , having his tongue cut out , so he could no longer speak his rebellion , and his right hand cut off , so that he could no longer write letters . Maximus was then exiled to the Lazica or Colchis region of modern @-@ day Georgia and was cast in the fortress of <unk> , perhaps <unk> @-@ <unk> near the modern town of <unk> . He died soon thereafter , on 13 August 662 . The events of the trials of Maximus were recorded by Anastasius <unk> . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Along with Pope Martin I , Maximus was vindicated by the Third Council of Constantinople ( the Sixth Ecumenical Council , 680 – 681 ) , which declared that Christ possessed both a human and a divine will . With this declaration Monothelitism became heresy , and Maximus was posthumously declared innocent of all charges against him . 
 Maximus is among those Christians who were venerated as saints shortly after their deaths . The vindication of Maximus ' theological position made him extremely popular within a generation after his death , and his cause was aided by the accounts of miracles at his tomb . In the Roman Catholic Church the veneration of Maximus began prior to the foundation of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints . 
 Maximus is one of the last men to be recognized by both the Orthodox and Catholic Churches as a Father of the Church . In the encyclical <unk> Salvi ( 2007 ) , Pope Benedict XVI called Maximus ' the great Greek doctor of the Church ' , although it 's not clear if the Pontiff intended to nominate Maximus ' Doctor of the Church ' or to say that he already was one . 
 = = Theology = = 
 As a student of Pseudo @-@ Dionysius , Maximus was one of many Christian theologians who preserved and interpreted the earlier Neo @-@ Platonic philosophy , including the thought of such figures as Plotinus and Proclus . Maximus ' work on Pseudo @-@ Dionysius the Areopagite was continued by John Scotus Eriugena at the request of Charles the Bald . 
 The Platonic influence on Maximus ' thought can be seen most clearly in his theological anthropology . Here , Maximus adopted the Platonic model of <unk> @-@ <unk> ( exit and return ) , teaching that humanity was made in the image of God , and the purpose of salvation is to restore us to unity with God . This emphasis on <unk> or theosis helped secure Maximus ' place in Eastern theology , as these concepts have always held an important place in Eastern Christianity . 
 <unk> Maximus insisted on a strict <unk> , which can be seen as a corollary of the emphasis on theosis . In terms of salvation , humanity is intended to be fully united with God . This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation . If Christ did not become fully human ( if , for example , he only had a divine and not a human will ) , then salvation was no longer possible , as humanity could not become fully divine . Furthermore , in his works Maximus the Confessor argued the <unk> of the divine incarnation . 
 Regarding salvation , Maximus has been described as a proponent of <unk> or universal reconciliation , the idea that all rational souls will eventually be redeemed , like Origen and St. Gregory of Nyssa . While this claim has been disputed , others have argued that Maximus shared this belief in universal reconciliation with his most spiritually mature students .

 Maximus ' work was translated by the 9th @-@ century , Irish philosopher and mystical theologian Johannes Scotus Eriugena . In Eastern Christianity , Maximus has always been influential . The Eastern theologians Symeon the New Theologian and Gregory Palamas are seen as intellectual heirs to Maximus . Further , a number of Maximus ' works are included in the Greek Philokalia , a collection of some of the most influential Orthodox Christian writers .

 = Álmos = 
 Álmos ( Hungarian pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) , also Almos or <unk> , ( c . 820 – c . 895 ) was – according to the uniform account of Hungarian chronicles – the first head of the " loose federation " of the Hungarian tribes from around 850 . Whether he was the sacred ruler ( kende ) of the Hungarians , or their military leader ( gyula ) is subject to scholarly debate . He apparently accepted the Khazar khagan 's suzerainty in the first decade of his reign , but the Hungarians acted independently of the Khazars from around 860 . The 14th @-@ century Illuminated Chronicle narrates that he was murdered in Transylvania at the beginning of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin around 895 . 
 = = Ancestry = = 
 Anonymus , the unknown author of the Gesta Hungarorum – who wrote his " historical romance " around 1200 or 1210 – states that Álmos descended " from the line " of Attila the Hun . A late 13th @-@ century chronicler , Simon of Kéza wrote that Álmos was " of the <unk> kindred " . He also wrote of Attila the Hun 's banner , which bore " the image of the bird the Hungarians call <unk> " – identified as either a gyrfalcon or a hawk . A bird has an important role in the legend about Álmos 's birth , which was preserved both by the Gesta Hungarorum and by the Illuminated Chronicle . The legend says that Álmos 's mother , already pregnant with him , dreamed of a bird of prey " which had the likeness of a hawk " impregnating her . Historians Gyula Kristó and Victor Spinei wrote that this story , which has close analogies in Turkic folklore , initially narrated the origin of Álmos 's family from a totemic ancestor . 
 According to the Gesta Hungarorum , Álmos was born to Emese , a daughter of " Prince <unk> " . However , Kristó writes that her name , containing the old Hungarian word for mother ( em ) , may have been invented by Anonymus . The name of Álmos 's father is likewise uncertain because the Hungarian chronicles preserved it in two variants . Anonymus states that Ügyek was his name , but the 14th @-@ century Illuminated Chronicle says that Előd – himself the son of Ügyek – was Álmos 's father . Kristó says that both names may have been the chroniclers ' inventions , since Ügyek 's name derives from the ancient Hungarian <unk> ( " saint , holy " ) word , and Előd 's name simply refers to an ancestor . Anonymus writes that Ügyek married Emese in 819 . If this date is correct , Álmos was born around 820 . 
 Although Anonymus makes a connection between the name of Álmos and the Hungarian word for dream ( <unk> ) , many historians , including András Róna @-@ Tas and Victor Spinei , argue that his name is of Turkic origin . If the latter theory is correct , it has a meaning of " the bought one " . Álmos 's family may have also been of Turkic stock , but according to Victor Spinei , a name 's etymology does not always reflect its bearer 's ethnicity . 
 In the year of Our Lord 's incarnation 819 , <unk> ... took to wife in <unk> the daughter of Prince <unk> , called Emese , from whom he begot a son , who was named Álmos . But he is called Álmos from a divine event , because when she was pregnant a divine vision appeared to his mother in a dream in the form of a falcon that seemed to come to her and impregnate her and made known to her that from her womb a torrent would come forth and from her loins glorious kings be generated , but that they would not multiply in their own land . Because a dream is called <unk> in the Hungarian language and his birth was predicted in a dream , so he was called Álmos . Or he was called Álmos , that is holy , because holy kings and dukes were born of his line . 
 = = Reign = = 
 Álmos , according to Gesta Hungarorum , was freely elected by the heads of the seven Hungarian tribes as their " leader and master " . Anonymus adds that to ratify Álmos 's election , the seven chiefs " swore an oath , confirmed in pagan manner with their own blood spilled in a single vessel " . Anonymus says that they also adopted the basic principles of the government , including the hereditary right of Álmos 's offsprings to his office and the right of his electors ' descendant to have a seat in the prince 's council . According to author Pál Engel , this report of the " treaty by blood " ( Hungarian : <unk> ) , which reflects its authors ' political philosophy rather than actual events , was " often presented by Hungarian historians as the very first manifestation of modern parliamentary thinking in Europe " up until 1945 . 
 In a sharply contrasting narrative from around 950 , the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus states that instead of Álmos , his son Árpád was the first supreme head of the Hungarian tribes , and that Árpád 's election was initiated by the Khazar khagan . The emperor says the khagan sent an envoy to the " voivodes " ( heads of the Hungarian tribes ) after they had been forced by the Pechenegs to leave their dwelling places near the Khazar Khaganate and to settle in a new territory called Etelköz . The khagan was planning to appoint one of the voivodes named Levedi to lead the Hungarian tribes to represent the khagan 's interests . Although Levedi refused the khagan 's offer , he proposed one of his peers , Álmos or Álmos 's son Árpád , to the proposed new position . The khagan accepted Levedi 's offer . Upon his initiative the Hungarians elected their first prince , but they preferred Árpád to his father . 
 Gyula Kristó and many other historians refute Porphyrogenitus 's report of the omission of Álmos in favor of his son , saying that the <unk> legend connected to Álmos 's birth proves his role as forefather of his dynasty . These historians say that the emperor 's account is based on a report by one of Árpád 's descendants named <unk> , who emphasized by this report of Árpád 's election that only those descending from Árpád were suitable to lead the Hungarians ; other children of Álmos were excluded . András Róna @-@ Tas says that Constantine Porphyrogenitus preserved the memory of a coup d 'état organized against Levedi kende by Álmos gyula , who had his own son Árpád elected as sacred ruler in his opponent 's place . A late 9th @-@ century Arabian scholar , al @-@ Jayhani – whose works were partially preserved in Ibn Rusta 's and other Muslim authors ' books – mentions the existence of these two high offices among the Hungarians . He describes the kende as the Hungarians ' sacred ruler and the gyula as their military commander . Historians still debate which of the two offices was held by Álmos . 
 The chagan said to [ Levedi ] : " We have invited you upon this account , in order that , since you are noble and wise and valorous and first among the [ Hungarians ] , we may appoint you prince of your nation , and you may be obedient to our word and our command . " But he , in reply , made answer to the chagan : " Your regard and purpose for me I highly esteem and express to you suitable thanks , but since I am not strong enough for this rule , I cannot obey you ; on the other hand , however , there is a voivode other than me , called [ Álmos ] , and he has a son called [ Árpád ] ; let one of these , rather , either that [ Álmos ] or his son [ Árpád ] , be made prince , and be obedient to your word . " That chagan was pleased at this saying , and gave some of his men to go with him , and sent them to the [ Hungarians ] , and after they had talked the matter over with the [ Hungarians ] , the [ Hungarians ] preferred that [ Árpád ] should be prince rather than [ Álmos ] his father , for he was of superior parts and greatly admired for wisdom and counsel and valour , and capable of this rule ; and so they made him prince according to the custom , or ' <unk> ' , of the Chazars , by lifting him upon a shield . 
 Kristó says that Álmos stood at the head of the Hungarian tribal confederation from around 850 . Porphyrogenitus 's narration says that he initially accepted the khagan 's suzerainty . The Hungarians apparently achieved their independence around 860 , since the earliest reports on their plundering raids in Central Europe were recorded thereafter . The Annals of St. Bertin mentions their incursion into Louis the German 's realm in 862 . Three tribes seceding from the Khazar Khaganate , together known by Porphyrogenitus as " <unk> " , also joined with the Hungarians in the 860s or 870s . Spinei says that the memory of their arrival was preserved by Anonymus , who mentions " the seven dukes of the Cumans " who " subjected themselves to Prince Álmos " at Kiev . 
 Anonymus writes of a war between the Hungarians and the Kievan Rus ' , ending with the victory of the Hungarians , who were commanded by Álmos . The Russian Primary Chronicle refers to a " Hungarian hill " at Kiev in connection with the town 's occupation by Oleg of Novgorod in 882 . The same chronicle mentions " a castle of Ol 'ma " ( <unk> <unk> ) standing on the same hill . George Vernadsky says that this fortress had been named after Álmos , but this theory has not been widely accepted by historians .

 The Hungarians who lived in the westernmost parts of the Pontic steppes were occasionally hired by neighboring powers to intervene in their wars . For instance , they invaded Moravia in alliance with Arnulf of East Francia in 892 . Their intervention in a conflict between the First Bulgarian Empire and the Byzantine Empire caused a joint counter @-@ invasion by the Bulgars and Pechenegs . The Hungarians were forced to leave the Pontic steppes and to cross the Carpathians in search of a new homeland around 895 . 
 According to the Gesta Hungarorum , the Hungarians invaded the Carpathian Basin under Álmos , who " appointed his son , Árpád , as leader and master " of the Hungarian tribal federation at Ungvár ( Uzhhorod , Ukraine ) . Thereafter Anonymous does not mention Álmos . In a contrasting report , the Illuminated Chronicle says that Álmos " could not enter Pannonia , for he was killed in Erdelw " ( Transylvania ) . Kristó says that the chronicle preserves the memory of Álmos 's sacrifice because of the catastrophic defeat of his people by the Pechenegs . If this is true , his ritual murder proves that Álmos was the sacred leader of the Hungarian tribal federation . Róna @-@ Tas refutes this and says that if the chronicle 's report is reliable , Álmos became the victim of a political murder committed or initiated by his own son . Preferring the narration of the Gesta Hungarorum to the report by the Illuminated Chronicle , Victor Spinei states that Álmos was not murdered in Transylvania , since Anonymus writes that the Hungarians bypassed this region when invading the Carpathian Basin .

 No source preserved the name of Álmos 's wife . Anonymus writes that she was " the daughter of a certain most noble prince " . Álmos 's only child known by name was Árpád , who succeeded Álmos after his death . The following is a family tree presenting Álmos 's closest relatives : 
 = Trouble ( Natalia Kills song ) = 
 " Trouble " is a song recorded by English singer and songwriter Natalia Kills for her second studio album of the same name ( 2013 ) , appearing on it as its closing track . The song 's lyrics were written about bad behavior and trouble , while musically , " Trouble " is a midtempo ' 90s @-@ esque pop rock number that emulates arena rock . The overall sound of the song was praised by contemporary music critics , who also highlighted its placement on the album track listing . 
 The song was featured in the 2014 compilation album Now That 's What I Call Music ! 49 , and has been performed by Kills in some live events . Despite not having been released as a single , director Emile Rafael filmed a video for " Trouble " , that explores Kills and her on @-@ screen boyfriend 's use of recreational drugs and their relationship ; it was released in February 2014 . Martin Kierszenbaum produced a remix of " Trouble " which features electronic musician Peaches .

 " Trouble " was recorded at Enormous Studios and Record Plant , both located in Los Angeles , California . It was written by Kills and American record producer Jeff Bhasker , who also produced the song . Additional production was provided by Emile Haynie and Guillaume Doubet , who along with Bhasker , programmed all the musical instruments played in the song . Guitars were played by Bhasker and Jimmy Messer ; keyboards and background vocals were helmed by the former . He also mixed the song . Audio engineering was handled by Bhasker and Pawel Sek , while mastering was done by Chris Athens at the Chris Athens Masters , located in Austin , Texas . 
 " Trouble " was first unveiled online on the same day of the release of its eponymous parent album , on the website Idolator . The release of an official third single for the album was made with the announcement of a fan contest , in which fans were asked to design or draw " interpretations " of the singer , however no winners were announced as of April 2014 . The track was also included in the 2014 compilation Now That 's What I Call Music ! 49 . While Idolator has also referred to it as the album 's third single , no official release proceeded . 
 = = Composition and reception = = 
 Musically , " Trouble " is an anthemic midtempo song , that is styled in the genre of 90s influenced pop rock . The singer 's voice in the song was deemed " <unk> " and " more exhausted " than in the other album tracks , which are also heard during the " singalong hook " . The song 's instrumentation utilizes stadium drums , guitars and keyboards , while background vocals resemblant of choirs — and serve as arena rock elements — sing " whoas " repeatedly . Lyrically , Kills speaks of bad behavior and trouble , while searching an alibi and a friend . Jake Buck of Vada described it as being " the perfect ending to represent the album ’ s entire theme of badass , rawness , [ and ] honesty " . Bradley Stern from MuuMuse described it as " Ryan Tedder @-@ meets @-@ Fun " while observing that the " cinematic quality " of Lana Del Rey 's music was present in the track . 
 Idolator editor Sam Lansky was very positive about " Trouble " , favoring the " anthemic sound " , which he described as evoking the catalog of English indie rock band Florence and the Machine . Bradley Stern from MuuMuse deemed it a " perfect way to close a celebration of imperfection " , and compared it to the music of the band fun .. For MTV Buzzworthy , Stern listed the song as second in his list of the " 5 Must @-@ Hear Pop Songs Of The Week " .

 Emile Rafael directed the official music video for " Trouble " , with production handled by Charlie Herranz . During an interview with Elle , Kills talked on the concept she went with for the visual . Kills revealed that she left her birthplace of Bradford in England at the age of 14 , in order to pursue her desire of having a better life , with a good boyfriend and life ; however she only felt " closer to <unk> " in parties , where she was exposed to recreational drugs . She started to consume them and she felt better with them for " a few short hours " . " They make you feel better , so the minute the high wears off you want more . But what 's wrong with wanting more ? " , Kills reflected . " More happiness , more power or freedom or love if you know that it 's obtainable without the hard work , rejection and bullshit ? [ ..... ] Sometimes it feels that reality is bad — much worse than the drug that helps you escape it for a few short hours . " She further explained that she wanted to create an " honest video that showed both [ her ] realities with all the disaster , delusion , and desire . " The video was released on 19 February 2014 on Kills ' Vevo and YouTube accounts . 
 The video begins with Kills walking around on a bridge , as she reminisces about her relationship with her boyfriend . As the song builds up to the first verse , they are depicted in the living room of a hazy @-@ looking apartment , and Kills smiles at him , who kisses her . They start to involve physically , however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar ; Kills , simultaneously , takes several pills . As they start to hallucinate , images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally . They leave the apartment and drive to a bar — still smoking — and as they reach there , Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there . She keeps hallucinating and sees herself in a golden dress as opposed to what she is actually dressing — a black T @-@ shirt . As she continues to sing , a short @-@ haired man who is watching her performance smiles at her and hits on her . Kills ' on @-@ screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings . A few moments after , Kills — who was oblivious to the fight — tries to break them up but gets hit by her boyfriend , and leaves the bar crying . He pursues her and they both argue inside their car . They abruptly stop arguing and begin having sexual intercourse . As the song reaches its end , Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment , where she spills a bottle of vodka on the ground . After looking at him , she lights it which causes the apartment to burn . 
 Writing for MTV News , Brad Stern opined that the visual was a " big Parental Advisory warning in motion " due to its explicit themes , and found it resemblant of Quentin Tarantino 's filmography . Idolator 's Mike Wass deemed the video " visually arresting " and recognized it as Kills ' " most fully realized " <unk> .

 On 21 November 2013 , Kills performed album songs " Trouble " , " Saturday Night " and " Marlboro Lights " at the studios of New Zealand radio station The Edge . In February of the following year , Kills performed at the Cherrytree Records House lounge . During the performance , Kills sung in an acoustic setting , where she was accompanied solely by a guitar . Bradley Stern from Idolator praised her vocal performance — he wrote that she had previously " prove [ n ] herself as a capable live vocalist " and that the Cherrytree House performance was " no exception " .

 = Great auk = 
 The great auk ( Pinguinus impennis ) was a flightless bird of the alcid family that became extinct in the mid @-@ 19th century . It was the only modern species in the genus Pinguinus ( unrelated to penguins , although it was the first bird to be called penguin ) . It bred on rocky , isolated islands with easy access to the ocean and a plentiful food supply , a rarity in nature that provided only a few breeding sites for the auks . When not breeding , the auks spent their time foraging in the waters of the North Atlantic , ranging as far south as northern Spain and also around the coast of Canada , Greenland , Iceland , the Faroe Islands , Norway , Ireland , and Great Britain . 
 The great auk was 75 to 85 centimetres ( 30 to 33 in ) tall and weighed around 5 kilograms ( 11 lb ) , making it the second largest member of the alcid family ( <unk> was larger ) . It had a black back and a white belly . The black beak was heavy and hooked , with grooves on its surface . During summer , the great auk 's plumage showed a white patch over each eye . During winter , the auk lost these patches , instead developing a white band stretching between the eyes . The wings were only 15 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) long , rendering the bird flightless . Instead , the auk was a powerful swimmer , a trait that it used in hunting . Its favourite prey were fish , including Atlantic menhaden and capelin , and crustaceans . Although agile in the water , it was clumsy on land . Great auk pairs mated for life . They nested in extremely dense and social colonies , laying one egg on bare rock . The egg was white with variable brown marbling . Both parents incubated the egg for about six weeks before the young hatched . The young auk left the nest site after two or three weeks although the parents continued to care for it . 
 The great auk was an important part of many Native American cultures , both as a food source and as a symbolic item . Many Maritime Archaic people were buried with great auk bones , and one was buried covered in over 200 auk beaks , which are assumed to have been part of a cloak made of their skins . Early European explorers to the Americas used the auk as a convenient food source or as fishing bait , reducing its numbers . The bird 's down was in high demand in Europe , a factor which largely eliminated the European populations by the mid @-@ 16th century . Scientists soon began to realize that the great auk was disappearing and it became the beneficiary of many early environmental laws , but this proved not to be enough . Its growing rarity increased interest from European museums and private collectors in obtaining skins and eggs of the bird . On 3 July 1844 , the last two confirmed specimens were killed on Eldey , off the coast of Iceland , which also eliminated the last known breeding attempt . There are unconfirmed later reports of roaming individuals being seen or caught . A record of a bird in 1852 is considered by some to be the last sighting of the species . The great auk is mentioned in several novels and the scientific journal of the American Ornithologists ' Union is named The Auk in honour of this bird . 
 = = Taxonomy and evolution = = 
 Analysis of mtDNA sequences has confirmed morphological and biogeographical studies suggesting that the razorbill is the great auk 's closest living relative . The great auk was also closely related to the little auk ( <unk> ) , which underwent a radically different evolution compared to Pinguinus . Due to its outward similarity to the razorbill ( apart from flightlessness and size ) , the great auk was often placed in the genus Alca , following Linnaeus . 
 The fossil record ( especially the sister species Pinguinus alfrednewtoni ) and molecular evidence show that the three closely related genera diverged soon after their common ancestor , a bird probably similar to a stout <unk> 's murrelet , had spread to the coasts of the Atlantic . By that time the murres , or Atlantic guillemots , had apparently already split from the other Atlantic alcids . <unk> @-@ like birds were common in the Atlantic during the Pliocene , but the evolution of the little auk is sparsely documented . The molecular data are compatible with either view , but the weight of evidence suggests placing the great auk in a distinct genus . Some ornithologists still feel it is more appropriate to retain the species in the genus Alca . It is the only British bird made extinct in historic times . 
 The following cladogram shows the placement of the great auk among its closest relatives , based on a 2004 genetic study : 
 Pinguinus alfrednewtoni was a larger and also flightless member of the genus Pinguinus that lived during the Early Pliocene . Known from bones found in the Yorktown Formation of the Lee Creek Mine in North Carolina , it is believed to have split along with the great auk from a common ancestor . Pinguinus alfrednewtoni lived in the western Atlantic while the great auk lived in the eastern Atlantic , but after the former died out after the Pliocene , the great auk replaced it . The great auk was not closely related to the other extinct genera of flightless alcids , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 The great auk was one of the 4400 animal species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th @-@ century work , Systema Naturae , in which it was named Alca impennis . The name Alca is a Latin derivative of the Scandinavian word for razorbills and their relatives . The species was not placed in its own genus , Pinguinus , until 1791 . The generic name is derived from the Spanish and Portuguese name for the species , and the specific name impennis is from Latin and refers to the lack of flight feathers or <unk> . 
 The Irish name for the great auk is ' <unk> <unk> ' , meaning ' big seabird / auk ' . The Basque name is <unk> , meaning " <unk> " . Its early French name was <unk> . The Norse called the great auk <unk> , which means " <unk> " . This has led to an alternative English common name for the bird , " <unk> " or " <unk> " . The Inuit name for the great auk was <unk> , which meant " little wing " . The word " penguin " first appears in the 16th century as a synonym for " great auk . " It may be derived from the Welsh pen <unk> " white head " , although the etymology is debated . When European explorers discovered what are today known as penguins in the Southern Hemisphere , they noticed their similar appearance to the great auk and named them after this bird , although they are not closely related . 
 = = Description = = 
 Standing about 75 to 85 centimetres ( 30 to 33 in ) tall and weighing around 5 kilograms ( 11 lb ) as adult birds , the flightless great auk was the second largest member of both its family and the order Charadriiformes , surpassed only by the <unk> <unk> . The auks that lived further north averaged larger in size than the more southerly members of the species . Males and females were similar in plumage , although there is evidence for differences in size , particularly in the bill and femur length . The back was primarily a glossy black , and the stomach was white . The neck and legs were short , and the head and wings small . The auk appeared chubby due to a thick layer of fat necessary for warmth . During summer , the great auk developed a wide white eye patch over the eye , which had a hazel or chestnut iris . During winter the auk moulted and lost this eye patch , which was replaced with a wide white band and a gray line of feathers which stretched from the eye to the ear . During the summer , the auk 's chin and throat were blackish @-@ brown , and the inside of the mouth was yellow . In winter , the throat became white . Some individuals had grey plumage on their flanks , but the purpose of this is unknown . The bill was large at 11 centimetres ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) long and curved downwards at the top ; the bill also had deep white grooves in both the upper and lower mandibles , up to seven on the upper mandible and twelve on the lower mandible in summer , though there were fewer in winter . The wings were only 15 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) in length and the longest wing feathers were only 10 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) long . Its feet and short claws were black while the webbed skin between the toes was brownish black . The legs were far back on the bird 's body , which gave it powerful swimming and diving abilities . 
 Hatchlings were grey and downy , but their exact appearance is unknown , since no skins exist today . Juvenile birds had less prominent grooves in their beaks and had mottled white and black necks , while the eye spot found in adults was not present ; instead , a grey line ran through the eyes ( which still had the white eye ring ) to just below the ears . 
 The auk 's calls included low croaking and a hoarse scream . A captive auk was observed making a gurgling noise when anxious . It is not known what its other vocalizations were like , but it is believed that they were similar to those of the razorbill , only louder and deeper . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The great auk was found in the cold North Atlantic coastal waters along the coasts of Canada , the northeastern United States , Norway , Greenland , Iceland , the Faroe Islands , Ireland , Great Britain , France , and northern Spain . The great auk left the North Atlantic waters for land only to breed , even roosting at sea when not breeding . The rookeries of the great auk were found from Baffin Bay to the Gulf of St. Lawrence , across the far northern Atlantic , including Iceland , and in Norway and the British Isles in Europe . For their nesting colonies the great auks required rocky islands with sloping shorelines that provided access to the seashore . These were very limiting requirements and it is believed that the great auk never had more than 20 breeding colonies . The nesting sites also needed to be close to rich feeding areas and be far enough from the mainland to discourage visitation by humans and polar bears . The localities of only six former breeding colonies are known : Papa Westray in the Orkney Islands , St Kilda off Scotland , <unk> Island and Eldey Island near Iceland , Funk Island near Newfoundland , and the Bird Rocks ( <unk> @-@ aux @-@ Oiseaux ) in the Gulf of St. Lawrence . Records suggest that this species may have bred on Cape Cod , Massachusetts . By the late 18th and early 19th centuries , the breeding range of the great auk was restricted to Funk Island , <unk> Island , Eldey Island , the Gulf of St. Lawrence , and St Kilda Island . Funk Island was the largest known breeding colony . 
 The great auk migrated north and south away from the breeding colonies after the chicks fledged and tended to go southward during late autumn and winter . It was common on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland . Its bones have been found as far south as Florida , where it may have occurred during four periods : around 1000 BC , 1000 AD , the 15th century , and the 17th century . ( It has been suggested that some of the bones discovered in Florida may be the result of aboriginal trading . ) The great auk typically did not go further south than Massachusetts Bay in the winter . 
 = = Ecology and behaviour = = 
 The great auk was never observed and described by modern scientists during its existence , and is only known from the accounts of laymen , such as sailors , so its behaviour is not well known and hard to reconstruct . Much can be inferred from its close , living relative , the razorbill , as well as from remaining soft tissue . 
 Great auks walked slowly and sometimes used their wings to help them traverse rough terrain . When they did run , it was awkwardly and with short steps in a straight line . They had few natural predators , mainly large marine mammals , such as the orca , and white @-@ tailed eagles . Polar bears preyed on nesting colonies of the auk . This species had no innate fear of human beings , and their flightlessness and awkwardness on land compounded their vulnerability . They were hunted for food , for feathers , and as specimens for museums and private collections . Great auks reacted to noises , but were rarely scared by the sight of something . The auks used their bills aggressively both in the dense nesting sites and when threatened or captured by humans . These birds are believed to have had a life span of about 20 to 25 years . During the winter , the great auk migrated south either in pairs or in small groups , and never with the entire nesting colony . 
 The great auk was generally an excellent swimmer , using its wings to propel itself underwater . While swimming , the head was held up but the neck was drawn in . This species was capable of banking , veering , and turning underwater . The great auk was known to dive to depths of 76 metres ( 249 ft ) and it has been claimed that the species was able to dive to depths of 1 kilometre ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) . To conserve energy , most dives were shallower . It could also hold its breath for 15 minutes , longer than a seal . Its ability to dive this deeply reduced competition with other alcid species . The great auk was capable of accelerating under water , then shooting out of the water to land on a rocky ledge above the ocean 's surface . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 This alcid typically fed in shoaling waters which were shallower than those frequented by other alcids , although after the breeding season they had been sighted up to 500 kilometres ( 310 mi ) from land . They are believed to have fed cooperatively in flocks . Their main food was fish , usually 12 to 20 centimetres ( 4 @.@ 7 to 7 @.@ 9 in ) in length and weighing 40 to 50 grams ( 1 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 8 oz ) , but occasionally their prey was up to half the bird 's own length . Based on remains associated with great auk bones found on Funk Island and on ecological and morphological considerations , it seems that Atlantic menhaden and capelin were their favoured prey . Other fish suggested as potential prey include <unk> , shorthorn sculpins , cod , crustaceans , and sand lance . The young of the great auk are believed to have eaten plankton and , possibly , fish and crustaceans regurgitated by adult auks . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Historical descriptions of the great auk 's breeding behaviour are somewhat unreliable . Great auks began pairing in early and mid @-@ May . They are believed to have mated for life , although some theorize that auks could have mated outside their pair , a trait seen in the razorbill . Once paired , they nested at the base of cliffs in colonies , where they likely copulated . Mated pairs had a social display in which they bobbed their heads , showing off their white eye patch , bill markings , and yellow mouth . These colonies were extremely crowded and dense , with some estimates stating that there was a nesting auk for every 1 square metre ( 11 sq ft ) of land . These colonies were very social . When the colonies included other species of alcid , the great auks were dominant due to their size . 
 Female great auks would lay only one egg each year , between late May and early June , although they could lay a replacement egg if the first one was lost . In years when there was a shortage of food , the auk did not breed . A single egg was laid on bare ground up to 100 metres ( 330 ft ) from shore . The egg was ovate and elongate in shape , and averaged 12 @.@ 4 centimetres ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) in length and 7 @.@ 6 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) across at the widest point . The egg was yellowish white to light ochre with a varying pattern of black , brown or greyish spots and lines which often congregated on the large end . It is believed that the variation in the egg 's streaks enabled the parents to recognize their egg in the colony . The pair took turns incubating the egg in an upright position for the 39 to 44 days before the egg hatched , typically in June , although eggs could be present at the colonies as late as August . 
 The parents also took turns feeding their chick . According to one account , the chick was covered with grey down . The young bird took only two or three weeks to mature enough to abandon the nest and land for the water , typically around the middle of July . The parents cared for their young after they fledged , and adults would be seen swimming with their young perched on their backs . Great auks sexually matured when they were four to seven years old . 
 = = Relationship with humans = = 
 The great auk was a food source for Neanderthals more than 100 @,@ 000 years ago , as evidenced by well @-@ cleaned bones found by their campfires . Images believed to depict the great auk were also carved into the walls of the El <unk> Cave , Santander in Spain over 35 @,@ 000 years ago , and cave paintings 20 @,@ 000 years old have been found in France 's Grotte <unk> . 
 Native Americans valued the great auk as a food source during the winter and as an important symbol . Images of the great auk have been found in bone necklaces . A person buried at the Maritime Archaic site at Port au Choix , Newfoundland , dating to about 2000 BC , was found surrounded by more than 200 great auk beaks , which are believed to have been part of a suit made from their skins , with the heads left attached as decoration . Nearly half of the bird bones found in graves at this site were of the great auk , suggesting that it had cultural significance for the Maritime Archaic people . The extinct Beothuks of Newfoundland made pudding out of the auk 's eggs . The Dorset Eskimos also hunted it ; the Saqqaq in Greenland overhunted the species , causing a local reduction in range . 
 Later , European sailors used the auks as a navigational beacon , as the presence of these birds signalled that the Grand Banks of Newfoundland were near . 
 This species is estimated to have had a maximum population in the millions . The great auk was hunted on a significant scale for food , eggs , and its down feathers from at least the 8th century . Prior to that , hunting by local natives can be documented from Late Stone Age Scandinavia and eastern North America , as well as from early 5th century Labrador , where the bird seems to have occurred only as a straggler . Early explorers , including Jacques Cartier and numerous ships attempting to find gold on Baffin Island , were not provisioned with food for the journey home , and therefore used this species as both a convenient food source and bait for fishing . Some of the later vessels anchored next to a colony and ran out planks to the land . The sailors then herded hundreds of these auks onto the ships , where they were slaughtered . Some authors have questioned whether this hunting method actually occurred successfully . Great auk eggs were also a valued food source , as the eggs were three times the size of a murre 's and had a large yolk . These sailors also introduced rats onto the islands . 
 = = = Extinction = = = 
 The Little Ice Age may have reduced the population of the great auk by exposing more of their breeding islands to predation by polar bears , but massive exploitation for their down drastically reduced the population . By the mid @-@ 16th century , the nesting colonies along the European side of the Atlantic were nearly all eliminated by humans killing this bird for its down , which was used to make pillows . In 1553 , the auk received its first official protection , and in 1794 Great Britain banned the killing of this species for its feathers . In St. John 's , those violating a 1775 law banning hunting the great auk for its feathers or eggs were publicly flogged , though hunting for use as fishing bait was still permitted . On the North American side , eider down was initially preferred , but once the eiders were nearly driven to extinction in the 1770s , down collectors switched to the auk at the same time that hunting for food , fishing bait , and oil decreased . 
 The great auk had disappeared from Funk Island by 1800 , and an account by Aaron Thomas of HMS Boston from 1794 described how the bird had been systematically slaughtered until then : 
 If you come for their Feathers you do not give yourself the trouble of killing them , but lay hold of one and pluck the best of the Feathers . You then turn the poor Penguin adrift , with his skin half naked and torn off , to perish at his <unk> . This is not a very humane method but it is the common <unk> . While you abide on this island you are in the constant <unk> of horrid cruelties for you not only skin them Alive , but you burn them Alive also to cook their Bodies with . You take a kettle with you into which you put a Penguin or two , you kindle a fire under it , and this fire is absolutely made of the unfortunate Penguins themselves . Their <unk> being oily soon produce a Flame ; there is no wood on the island . 
 With its increasing rarity , specimens of the great auk and its eggs became collectible and highly prized by rich Europeans , and the loss of a large number of its eggs to collection contributed to the demise of the species . Eggers , individuals who visited the nesting sites of the great auk to collect their eggs , quickly realized that the birds did not all lay their eggs on the same day , so they could make return visits to the same breeding colony . Eggers only collected eggs without embryos growing inside them and typically discarded the eggs with embryos . 
 On the islet of Stac an Armin , St Kilda , Scotland , in July 1844 , the last great auk seen in the British Isles was caught and killed . Three men from St Kilda caught a single " <unk> " , noticing its little wings and the large white spot on its head . They tied it up and kept it alive for three days , until a large storm arose . Believing that the auk was a witch and the cause of the storm , they then killed it by beating it with a stick . 
 The last colony of great auks lived on <unk> ( the " Great Auk Rock " ) off Iceland . This islet was a volcanic rock surrounded by cliffs which made it inaccessible to humans , but in 1830 the islet submerged after a volcanic eruption , and the birds moved to the nearby island of Eldey , which was accessible from a single side . When the colony was initially discovered in 1835 , nearly fifty birds were present . Museums , desiring the skins of the auk for preservation and display , quickly began collecting birds from the colony . The last pair , found incubating an egg , was killed there on 3 July 1844 , on request from a merchant who wanted specimens , with Jón <unk> and Sigurður <unk> strangling the adults and Ketill <unk> smashing the egg with his boot . 
 Great auk specialist John <unk> interviewed the two men who killed the last birds , and <unk> described the act as follows : 
 The rocks were covered with blackbirds [ referring to <unk> ] and there were the <unk> ... They walked slowly . Jón <unk> crept up with his arms open . The bird that Jón got went into a corner but [ mine ] was going to the edge of the cliff . It walked like a man ... but moved its feet quickly . [ I ] caught it close to the edge – a precipice many fathoms deep . Its wings lay close to the sides - not hanging out . I took him by the neck and he flapped his wings . He made no cry . I strangled him . 
 A later claim of a live individual sighted in 1852 on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland has been accepted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources ( IUCN ) . 
 = = = Preserved specimens = = = 
 Today , 78 skins of the great auk remain mostly in museum collections , along with around 75 eggs and 24 complete skeletons . All but four of the surviving skins are in summer plumage , and only two of these are immature . No hatchling specimens exist . Each egg and skin has been assigned a number by specialists . Though thousands of isolated bones were collected from 19th century Funk Island to Neolithic middens , only a few complete skeletons exist . Natural mummies are also known from Funk Island , and the eyes and internal organs of the last two birds from 1844 are stored in the Zoological Museum , Copenhagen . It is uncertain where their skins are located today , but according to Errol Fuller , three are suspected due to their connection to a specific dealer in Copenhagen ; the specimens in Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History , in the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences , and the one in <unk> @-@ Museum Bremen . 
 Following the bird 's extinction , remains of the great auk increased dramatically in value , and auctions of specimens created intense interest in Victorian Britain , where 15 specimens are now located , the largest number of any country . A specimen was bought in 1971 by the Icelandic Museum of National History for £ 9000 , which placed it in the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive stuffed bird ever sold . The price of its eggs sometimes reached up to 11 times the amount earned by a skilled worker in a year . The present whereabouts of six of the eggs are unknown , and several other eggs have been accidentally destroyed . Two mounted skins were destroyed in the 20th century , one in the Mainz Museum during the Second World War , and one in the Museu Bocage , Lisbon , was destroyed by a fire in 1978 . 
 = = = Cultural depictions = = = 
 The great auk is one of the more frequently referenced extinct birds in literature , much like the famous Dodo . It appears in many works of children 's literature . Charles Kingsley 's The Water @-@ Babies , A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby depicts a great auk telling the tale of its species ' extinction . ( In this image , Kingsley 's artist played with or misunderstood the words " large pair of white spectacles " , intended to mean the natural white patches on the bird 's face . ) Enid Blyton 's The Island of Adventure features the bird 's extinction , sending the protagonist on a failed search for what he believes is a lost colony of the species . 
 The great auk is also present in a wide variety of other works of fiction . In the short story The Harbor @-@ Master , by Robert W. Chambers , the discovery and attempted recovery of the last known pair of great auks is central to the plot ( which also involves a proto @-@ H.P. Lovecraftian element of suspense ) . The story first appeared in <unk> 's Magazine ( Aug 1889 ) and was slightly revised to become the first five chapters of Chambers <unk> novel In Search of the Unknown , ( Harper and Brothers Publishers , New York , 1904 ) . In his novel Ulysses , James Joyce mentions the bird while the novel 's main character is drifting into sleep . He associates the great auk with the mythical <unk> as a method of formally returning the main character to a sleepy land of fantasy and memory . Penguin Island , a 1908 French satirical novel by the Nobel Prize winning author Anatole France , narrates the fictional history of a great auk population that is mistakenly baptized by a nearsighted missionary . A great auk is collected by fictional naturalist Stephen Maturin in the Patrick O 'Brian historical novel The Surgeon 's Mate . This work also details the harvesting of a colony of auks . The great auk is the subject of a novel , The Last Great Auk by Allen Eckert , which tells of the events leading to the extinction of the great auk as seen from the perspective of the last one alive . The bird also appears in Farley Mowat 's Sea of Slaughter . 
 This bird is also featured in a variety of other media . It is the subject of a ballet , Still Life at the Penguin Café , and a song , " A Dream Too Far " , in the ecological musical Rockford 's Rock Opera . A great auk appears as a prized possession of Baba the Turk in Igor Stravinsky 's opera The Rake 's Progress ( libretto by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman ) . The great auk is the mascot of the Archmere Academy in Claymont , Delaware , Sir Sandford Fleming College in Ontario , and the Adelaide University Choral Society ( <unk> ) in Australia . It is also the mascot of the Knowledge Masters educational competition . The scientific journal of the American Ornithologists ' Union is named The Auk in honour of this bird . According to Homer Hickam 's memoir , Rocket Boys , and its film production , October Sky , the early rockets he and his friends built were ironically named " Auk " . A cigarette company , the British Great Auk Cigarettes , was named after this bird . Walton Ford , the American painter , has featured great auks in two paintings : " The Witch of St. Kilda " and " Funk Island " . The English painter and writer Errol Fuller produced " Last Stand " for his monograph on the species . The great auk also appeared on one stamp in a set of five depicting extinct birds issued by Cuba in 1974 . Ogden Nash warns that humans could suffer the same fate as the great auk in his short poem " A Caution to Everybody . "

 Dr. Megan Hunt ( Dana Delany ) receives a call as a hand and a foot was found . Megan and Peter Dunlop ( Nicholas Bishop ) notice that the hand and foot are severed , leading them to search for the other body parts . Megan concludes that it is a single male and has rheumatoid arthritis . After finding a stamp on the victim , it leads them to a casino , they find out his name is Cal , and see him on the security footage . Megan , Peter , and Ethan Gross ( Geoffrey Arend ) find a knee and a thigh , and the team find out that the man had knee replacement surgery . Peter tracks the serial number for the knee replacement ; finding out the victim is Callum O 'Donnell . His daughter Jenny ( Abigail Hawk ) identifies the body parts of Callum , based on his scars and injuries . They find the rest of Callum 's body parts in his freezer , apart from the head . Megan and Detective Samantha Baker ( Sonja Sohn ) speak to Callum 's neighbours , Mira ( Li Jun Li ) and Frank Ling ( Pun <unk> ) and the Ling 's nanny , Irina ( Kathy Searle ) . 
 The money that Callum won from the casino is missing , and Samantha finds it with Jenny and her husband Dean ( Tom Pelphrey ) , after they stole it . Jenny and Dean are brought into questioning ; however Jenny tells Megan that Callum was giving it to her , to go on an art course . Samantha talks to Frank again , but when they question him about Irina but he does not know her . They find out that Irina was Callum 's nurse , for his arthritis and that Callum was going to help Irina get her son from Belgrade to the US . Irina confesses that she did cut up Callum , but did not kill him . Irina found Callum dead , so cut him up so that she could forge the last immigration document to get her son to her as Callum had not finished it . Irina tells Megan where the head is , and they find a fracture on his head . Megan and Samantha go back to Callum ’ s apartment , and Megan demonstrates why Irina couldn ’ t have killed Callum due to the mark on the wall being too high to be Irina . Megan traces metal to Callum 's landlord , Mike Walsh ( Kelly AuCoin ) . Samantha infers that because Cal was under rent control , Mike killed him so a paying client could stay in the apartment . Meanwhile , Lacey Fleming ( Mary Mouser ) asks if she can go to Megan 's work , for a school project . Lacey arrives , and speaks with Dr. Kate Murphy ( Jeri Ryan ) , discussing her work . Lacey tries to get Kate to allow her to see the body , however she refuses . Lacey speaks to Ethan , Curtis Brumfield ( Windell Middlebrooks ) and later Megan , who shows her pictures of bodies , telling her about her job .

 " Talking Heads " received positive reviews . Of Kathy Searle 's appearance as " steely " Irina , <unk> said , " Searle impressively took on a Russian accent with flying colors in the series Body Of Proof " . Orlando expressed her disappointment at John Carroll Lynch 's character Bud Morris not appearing in this episode saying , " The show lacked his sarcastic wit and his banter with Megan . We 're just a few episode 's into this show and I 've already been enjoying their chemistry " . She also praised Searle 's performance saying , " When Irina described cutting up Callum 's body it was with an eerie coldness . She liked the man and he cared for her . Yet , once dead he was no longer an asset to her but a problem that needed to be disposed of , literally . I could only imagine the parts of yourself you 'd have to shut down to be able to take a hacksaw to someone you were fond of " . Also praising Kelly AuCoin 's performance , she said that she wasn 't " sure who was more disturbing , Irina or the landlord who swung a hammer at the man 's head and then went on with his day as though nothing had occurred " . Finally , she praised the scenes between Megan and Lacey ( Mary Mouser ) . 
 TV Overmind 's Carissa Pavlica commented on Tom Pelphrey guest role saying " I adored Guiding Light and considering the roles Tom Pelphrey ( my beloved Jonathan from GL ) gets after his run as the bad @-@ boy , I immediately suspected he would be the killer .

She continued , " There is nothing I enjoy less than watching the crime being committed in the first minutes of a show and then watching the respective squad of police and detectives miss clues we already know . Body of Proof isn 't afraid to allow the audience to use their intellect " . Pavlica also enjoyed the relationship between Megan and Lacey , calling it " heart wrenching " saying that she had a tear in eye due to the scenes . " I 'm enjoying how the writers are piecing together the strained relationship they had , in a realistic , no holds barred way " . However , <unk> was afraid to " jinx " the show , as she had " no idea of Body of Proof 's place in the ratings " , adding that she was " nervous " as it is up against shows such as The Good Wife and Parenthood . 
 = Battle of Britain Day = 
 The Battle of Britain Day is the name given to the large @-@ scale aerial battle that took place on 15 September 1940 , during the Battle of Britain ( German : <unk> um England or <unk> um <unk> ) . 
 In June 1940 , Nazi Germany had conquered most of Western Europe and Scandinavia . At that time , the only major power standing in the way of a German @-@ dominated Europe was the British Empire and the Commonwealth . After having several peace offers rejected by the British , Adolf Hitler ordered the Luftwaffe to destroy the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) in order to gain air superiority or air supremacy as a prelude to launching Operation Sea Lion , an amphibious assault by the Wehrmacht ( German armed forces ) onto the British mainland . 
 In July 1940 , the Luftwaffe started by closing the English Channel to merchant shipping . In August , Operation Adlerangriff ( Eagle Attack ) was launched against RAF airfields in southern England . By the first week of September , the Luftwaffe had not gained the results desired by Hitler . Frustrated , the Germans turned towards the strategic bombing of cities , an offensive which was aimed at British military and civil industries , but also civilian morale . The attacks began on 7 September 1940 , but were to reach their daylight climax on 15 September . 
 On Sunday , 15 September 1940 , the Luftwaffe launched its largest and most concentrated attack against London in the hope of drawing out the RAF into a battle of annihilation . Around 1 @,@ 500 aircraft took part in the air battles which lasted until dusk . The action was the climax of the Battle of Britain . 
 RAF Fighter Command defeated the German raids . The Luftwaffe formations were dispersed by a large cloud base and failed to inflict severe damage on the city of London . In the aftermath of the raid , Hitler postponed Operation Sea Lion . Having been defeated in daylight , the Luftwaffe turned its attention to The Blitz night campaign which lasted until May 1941 . 
 The 15th of September , also known as Battle of Britain Day , is now an annual commemoration of the battle in the United Kingdom . In Canada , the commemoration takes place on the third Sunday of September . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Battle of Britain began on 10 July 1940 , when the first Luftwaffe bomber fleets began attacking convoys and Royal Navy forces in English ports and Channel . The results were positive and the Germans succeeded in forcing the British to abandon the channel convoy route and to redirect shipping to ports in north @-@ eastern Britain . With this achieved the Luftwaffe began the second phase of its air offensive , attacking RAF airfields and supporting structures on the British mainland . The codename of the offensive was Unternehmen Adlerangriff ( " Operation Eagle Attack " ) . On 12 August , it flew its first missions in this regard . On 13 August , the Luftwaffe carried out its largest attack to date on the mainland . Christened Adlertag ( " Eagle Day " ) , the attack was a failure . Nevertheless , the raids continued , at great cost to both sides . The impact of the German offensive on RAF airfields and Fighter Command is disputed . Some historians believe that the attacks were not having much effect and that the Germans were losing the attrition battle , while others believe the RAF was faltering . 
 Either way , Hitler was dissatisfied with the progress being made . Prompted by an RAF raid on Berlin in late August 1940 , he ordered the Luftwaffe to concentrate its attacks upon London . It was thought the move would draw RAF Fighter Command up into a large , decisive battle . Initially , the change in strategy caught the British off @-@ guard . The first daylight attack of this type occurred on 7 September and caused extensive damage and civilian casualties . Some 107 @,@ 400 long tons ( 109 @,@ 100 t ) of shipping was damaged in the Thames Estuary and 1 @,@ 600 civilians were killed or injured . Still , Hitler was critical of the Luftwaffe and its failure to destroy Fighter Command quickly . He dismissed over @-@ optimistic reports from the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe ( OKL or High Command of the Air Force ) , particularly the Chief of the Luftwaffe general staff Hans Jeschonnek , who asserted the RAF was on its last legs . Confident the RAF was nearly defeated , Jeschonnek requested terror bombing to be enacted as a final blow . Hitler refused , and only allowed attacks on industry , communications and public utility targets . 
 Over the next few days , bad weather prevented more large attacks . On 9 and 11 September , only smaller raids were carried out . It gave Hugh Dowding AOC ( Air Officer Commanding ) Fighter Command , the chance to prepare and reinforce his forces . The British , possibly through the use of Ultra intelligence , recognised the German change in strategy and duly prepared for further attacks on the capital . ULTRA 's contribution to the preparations for 15 September is also disputed . The intelligence from ULTRA at this stage in the war tended to be fragmented . With the Germans launching attacks whenever there was clear weather , it would not have been difficult for RAF Fighter Command to have predicted an attack on 15 September , which was to be a clear day . 
 = = German strategy = = 
 On the afternoon of 14 September , Hitler and his command held a conference at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin to discuss the future direction of the war . Göring was not present . Instead , he was inspecting Luftwaffe units in Belgium . Erhard Milch replaced him . Hitler praised the attacks which had caused heavy damage to the RAF and London . He blamed the failure to achieve more decisive results on the weather . Nevertheless , it was clear to Hitler that victory had still not been attained by the Luftwaffe . Under those circumstances , Operation Sea Lion could not take place . Großadmiral Erich Raeder , commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Kriegsmarine , agreed . He argued that Sea Lion should only be carried out as a last resort regardless of gaining air superiority . 
 Hitler wanted to maintain the threat of invasion by continuing air attacks on military targets in the British capital . Hans Jeschonnek still pushed for attacks on civilian morale . He argued that military and civilian industries were located too far apart to achieve a collapse of morale by attacking the former . Instead , he pressed for attacks against residential areas . Hitler refused . He ordered that only military targets in London were to be attacked . 
 The Luftwaffe intimated that a period of good weather was now due over France , Belgium and southern Britain . They prepared for an attack along the lines set by Hitler . Staff officers of Luftflotte 2 based in Brussels began planning for a two @-@ pronged offensive on 15 September . 
 The targets were purely military . The first target selected was the Battersea railway station ( <unk> ) West London Extension Railway in Battersea district . The tracks were 12 abreast in some places and linked London to the heavy industries of the West Midlands and other industrial cities on the north and south @-@ east of Britain . The conglomeration of lines included rail @-@ over @-@ rail bridges which were vulnerable to air attack . This was what air planners referred to as " choke points " , which if cut could erode enemy communication efficiency . 
 The second target , for the larger second attack during the afternoon would be the dock areas of the Thames Estuary including the warehouse of the East End of London , Surrey Commercial Docks , south of the river , and Royal Docks ( Royal Victoria Dock , West India Docks , Royal Albert Dock and King George V Dock ) . 
 = = = Intelligence = = = 
 The strategy could only be valid if intelligence assessments were correct . To German intelligence , it seemed as if the RAF might be on the verge of collapse . The attacks on London , thus far , seemed to confirm the assumption . None of the Luftwaffe bomber formations had encountered the well organised , effective and ferocious defence that had characterised the battles in August 1940 . If the German intelligence was correct , then by striking against vital choke points in London that the RAF would be forced to defend , the Luftwaffe had the opportunity to destroy the remaining RAF fighter forces . Not only would the attacks allow for the attainment of air superiority , they would eliminate a vital rail network , destroy shipping and supplies brought in from North America , and affect civilian morale by demonstrating London ’ s vulnerability to air power . 
 The policy of attacking London after the successful 7 September raid quickly became counter @-@ productive , and in this matter the Luftwaffe suffered from serious misjudgement resulting from their intelligence service . The crews had been told the RAF was down to its last reserves and that one more assault would clinch victory . This was incorrect which meant bomber crews would be in for a shock on 15 September . The RAF had been given much needed rest after intense operations by the shift in German strategy . British radar , having been virtually untouched , was still able to follow the slow German build ups over France long before the first German aircraft reached British airspace . It would give the rested Fighter Command units plenty of warning . Moreover , by choosing to attack London , it exposed the bombers to greater danger by forcing them to fly greater distances in hostile air space . German crews would be forced to fight all the way to London and back . As it happened , all the German bomber units were at least intercepted on 15 September , and were then scattered as they withdrew . 
 Hitler was satisfied . The reasoning of the Luftwaffe seemed sound . Should the bombing achieve its aim , it offered considerable strategic value . The strike against London meant that most of the fighting on 15 September would take place between Luftflotte 2 under Albert Kesselring and Keith Park ’ s No. 11 Group RAF . 
 = = British strategy = = 
 There was a debate which raged within Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain . It centred around what strategy to pursue against the Luftwaffe . AOC Hugh Dowding and AOC 11 Group Keith Park favoured a strategy of non @-@ attrition . From their perspective , the RAF had to remain intact to win the battle , rather than decimate the Luftwaffe . Both felt that trying to fight a battle of attrition would give the numerically superior enemy the chance to destroy large parts of the Command in one go , thus playing into Göring 's hands . Therefore , Park and Dowding advocated the tactic of sending small numbers of fighters to intercept every raid ; providing opposition to every raid offered the chance of inflicting continued attrition on German formations while avoiding decisive damage to Fighter Command . 
 Park 's equivalent and another of Dowding 's commanders , AOC 12 Group Trafford Leigh @-@ Mallory , held the opposite view . For him , large forces would win the battle by destroying large numbers of the enemy . This attrition strategy would use the concept of the Big Wing as its basis . 
 = = = The Big Wing = = = 
 Air Vice @-@ Marshal Trafford Leigh @-@ Mallory and Squadron Leader Douglas Bader came to play significant roles in the September fighting . Bader commanded 242 Squadron flying Hurricanes in Leigh @-@ Mallory 's 12 Group , which defended the vital industrial targets in the West Midlands . A source of frustration to Leigh @-@ Mallory was the way in which his squadrons were used . During Luftwaffe attacks on south @-@ east England 12 Group units were tasked with protecting 11 Group sector stations north of the Thames Estuary , while Leigh @-@ Mallory believed his units should be in action south of the Thames . Mallory also criticised the way Park and Dowding were conducting the battle . The popular image of outnumbered Spitfires and Hurricanes meeting an enemy with huge numerical strength preyed upon his mind . He favoured a reverse of the image . 
 Bader was bored and frustrated at being left out of the major actions in the south . To Bader , it did not make sense for 12 Group to apparently sit idle while 11 Group suffered heavy losses and fought at a numerical disadvantage . Bader advocated scrambling 12 Group fighters as soon as German aircraft were detected forming up over France or Belgium . He asserted 12 Group was quick enough to reach 20 @,@ 000 ft ( 6 @,@ 100 m ) over the Thames Estuary before the enemy reached the area . He planned to use large forces , three to five squadrons to engage the enemy . Should this succeed , 11 Group , following up attacks , might have found broken enemy formations whose crews had lost the determination to press on to their targets . Bader implied that this may reduce the losses of fighter pilots in 11 Group . After the war , Bader insisted that both he and Leigh @-@ Mallory wanted the Big Wing tactic enacted in 12 Group only . They both believed , according to Bader , that it was impractical to use in 11 Group as the command was located too close to the enemy and would not have enough time to assemble . 
 Dowding saw 12 Group as the protector of the Midlands and a reserve for 11 Group . Mallory and Bader wanted to ignore both the defence of the Midlands and keeping a reserve in order to commit 12 Group to battle . In essence , they proposed the opposite of Dowding and resolved to commit the reserves before the front @-@ line units . While this method may have spared 11 Group , it had its problems . Although Mallory and Bader wanted to stop the enemy before it hit RAF airfields , the amount of time it took to position large formations for interception meant that the Big Wing often failed to achieve this . Instead , they engaged the enemy as he withdrew . Prompted by a supporting comment from Leigh @-@ Mallory , to the effect that it did not matter when an <unk> was made , as long as it accounted for a large number of enemy aircraft , Bader announced that he would rather destroy 50 German bombers after hitting their targets than 10 before . The argument was strong ; crippling losses would act as a deterrent , so that damage sustained on an occasion when the Germans did get through would have to be offset against later occasions when they did not even care to try . 
 The counter @-@ arguments were much stronger . The assumption that the Germans would be put off by losses was wrong ; it would have taken severe losses for the OKL to change its mind on target selection . The targets were also vital . The airfields themselves supported the squadrons in the field , while the loss of the vital sector @-@ stations could well have crippled the defence system . Thus the possibility of allowing the bulk of the German bombers to reach their target unscathed was unacceptable . The idea that the Big Wing could inflict heavier losses than had been achieved up until then was based on an overestimate of the numbers of aircraft shot down by the Big Wing . Leigh @-@ Mallory , Sholto Douglas and Bader had based their opinions on claims made by RAF units in battle . However , particularly when a large number of aircraft were engaged , it was possible for the same aircraft to be claimed by more than one pilot . As a result , the RAF claimed 100 or more German aircraft shot down in one day on five occasions , while analysis of Luftwaffe losses has shown that there were only four occasions on which the Luftwaffe lost more than 50 aircraft , and never did they lose 100 or more in a day . Nevertheless , while it is not known whether Mallory and Bader were aware that the claims of the RAF and Big Wings were exaggerated , they certainly tried to use them as a potent tool with which to remove Park and Dowding from command and pursue the Big Wing tactic . 
 = = = Non @-@ attrition = = = 
 Keith Park , with endorsement from Dowding , opted for the opposite strategy . Park maintained that it was unimportant to inflict large losses on the Germans in comparison to safeguarding his own forces . Park believed the Germans would give up if they could not achieve their aim of air superiority . This , simply put , meant avoiding the destruction and or depletion of Fighter Command was the primary factor in air defence . This would be achieved by sending small numbers of fighters to intercept , minimising losses in the air . By remaining to offer undiminished and constant air opposition , the RAF ensured the Luftwaffe could not win . As long as some sort of cost was imposed before the enemy dropped his bombs and impaired the defence system , the RAF could remain intact to meet the threat again the next day . To this end , Park favoured the 10 bomber kills before the attack , rather than the 50 shot down after it . The strategy suggested an enemy would give up if he felt he was getting nowhere . For even while his losses remained moderate , it would be senseless to suffer those casualties for no return . Park and Dowding 's strategy , under the circumstances , was the wiser choice .

 The Luftwaffe had suffered heavy attrition since the opening of the Battle of Britain . Just over a month earlier , it possessed 2 @,@ 226 operational aircraft on 17 August . By 7 September , it had 1 @,@ 895 aircraft , a drop of 15 percent . Still , most of the losses were being made good by production . During the battle , the Luftwaffe had undergone a major reorganisation . Luftflotte 5 in Norway had sent most of its Messerschmitt Bf 110 and medium bomber units ( Kampfgeschwader or Bomber Wings ) to Luftflotte 2 and 3 . Luftflotte 3 then passed most of its Messerschmitt Bf 109 units to Luftflotte 2 which was based in the Netherlands , Belgium and France . 
 According to the Luftwaffe order of battle dated 7 September , the nearest date covered by the list , the three Air Fleets contained 1 @,@ 895 aircraft . Luftflotte 2 had 1 @,@ 311 machines including ; 533 Bf 109s , 107 Bf 110s , 51 reconnaissance and 484 medium bomber aircraft . A further 120 Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers were on the order of battle , but were not used . 
 Luftwaffe readiness was less than ideal . In August , 211 pilots had been killed , including 105 fighter pilots and 91 bomber pilots . Missing pilots amounted to 132 fighter and 94 bomber pilots alone , with a further respective loss of 47 and 28 wounded . The effect on operational ready crews was significant . Messerschmitt Bf 110 units had 60 % of crews against authorised strength . For bomber units , it was 65 % , while Bf 109 units had 81 % of crews ready , a 5 % increase from the 76 % level in the first week of September . However , by 14 September , Bf 109 units possessed only 67 % of crews against authorised aircraft . In Bf 110 units , it fell to just 46 % , and in bomber units it dropped to 59 % . One week later , the figures were 64 , 52 and 52 % respectively . 
 = = = RAF forces = = = 
 In the six weeks of intensive combat , RAF strength had been maintained to extent far greater than the Luftwaffe intelligence had believed possible . On the evening of 14 September , Fighter Command could muster 269 Supermarine Spitfire and 533 Hawker Hurricane fighters . The two vital groups could put up just over 500 fighters . No. 11 Group RAF had 310 fighters , including 92 Spitfires and 218 Hurricanes . No. 12 Group RAF could field 85 Spitfires and 109 Hurricanes . Should No. 10 Group RAF come into the battle , a further 48 Spitfires and 78 Hurricanes could be committed . Compared with 17 August , there were just 22 fewer Spitfires and Hurricanes . 
 During the battle , the RAF had suffered a serious loss of experienced pilots . In mid @-@ September , Fighter Command could call upon 1 @,@ 492 operational pilots against an establishment of 1 @,@ 662 — a deficiency of 10 % . Many of the pilots were ineffective unless led into battle by experienced men . Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding 's policy was to move in fresh squadrons from quieter areas to replace losses in the units in the south @-@ east as they became exhausted . By early September , the system was breaking down as squadrons were becoming depleted before fresh units could be formed and take their place . 
 Reluctantly , Dowding defined three categories , A , B and C. Category A units were to bear the brunt of the fighting , and were to be kept at full strength in aircraft and pilots . Only if the A units suffered exceptionally high losses would they be replaced . B units were relief units , to be maintained at operational strength and only used if absolutely necessary . C units were generally stripped down to just five or six pilots . These units were devoted to training new pilots . Although not fit for fighter @-@ fighter action , they could defend quieter areas . The system potentially could have had fatal results for Fighter Command , with C units becoming less and less effective . But the system had not been running long enough by 14 September for it to have a serious impact on Fighter Command 's strength . The replacement units were sufficient in number and effectiveness to continue to replace exhausted units . By 15 September , the C units could still give a good account of themselves in battle .

 The Luftwaffe began its eighth consecutive night of bombing London on 15 September . Soon after midnight , 13 unidentified Dornier Do 17 light bombers attacked the capital . At 00 : 15 two Junkers Ju 88s followed from Kampfgeschwader 51 ( KG 51 , or 51st Bomber Wing ) . A further 11 Heinkel He 111s from an unidentified unit bombed the city again at 00 : 50 . At 02 : 00 , five He 111s from Kampfgeschwader 4 ( KG 4 ) bombed the city . A full strike by the Geschwader had been planned , but bad weather had forced a cancellation after five He 111s had taken off . Most of the damage was done to residential areas in Fulham , Chelsea and Westminster . Around 19 people were killed and 31 injured . The heaviest casualties were caused when a bomb fell on a Church in Chelsea killing 14 and injuring 26 . Small raiding forces bombed Cardiff , Bootle ( in Liverpool ) , Leicester and Ipswich . At Bootle , only slight damage was done to rail tracks and facilities at West Alexandra Dock . At sea , a Heinkel He 115 floatplane attacked and sank the 5 @,@ 548 long tons ( 5 @,@ 637 t ) freighter <unk> River off Montrose with a torpedo . Soon after , the freighter Halland was sunk by the same method in the area . At 03 : 30 , He <unk> flew up the Thames Estuary and dropped magnetic anti @-@ shipping mines . Further mines were dropped in the Bristol Channel , Liverpool Bay and Milford Haven and off Hartlepool , Berwick @-@ upon @-@ Tweed and Aberdeen . RAF night fighter defences were still in their infancy . Most fighters lacked radar and in any case , radar was short @-@ range and unreliable . Instead , they flew outside the anti @-@ aircraft guns ' fields of fire on likely approach routes using the pilots ' vision to locate enemy aircraft . In later years , the night fighter defences would be highly sophisticated . But in 1940 , they were not effective . Just 28 sorties were flown against the nocturnal raids . 
 There was also air activity over German @-@ held territory . RAF Bomber Command flew 92 sorties against German invasion targets at Boulogne , Calais , Ostend , Dunkirk , and Antwerp . The remaining sorties were directed at Brussels marshalling yards , Hamm and Krefeld . One Armstrong Whitworth Whitley failed to return . It was lost to ground fire over the Netherlands . A total of 157 sorties were flown overall . By the September 1940 , some 10 – 13 % of invasion barges had been sunk . 
 The first combat in daylight began just after 08 : 00 . A He 111 from Aufklärungsgruppe 51 ( Long @-@ range Reconnaissance Group 51 ) , based near Paris , was intercepted and shot down over the Channel by Hurricanes from No. 87 Squadron RAF . A Heinkel He 59 air @-@ sea rescue aircraft was dispatched , but found no trace of the Heinkel or its five crew . 
 Further flights were made by high altitude Ju 88s . One photographed RAF Sealand , RAF Pembrey and RAF Woodward . It also managed to reach Manchester , Liverpool and Birkenhead without interception . Another managed to photograph the Thames Haven , RAF Netheravon , RAF Benson and the Royal Navy base at Chatham Dockyard . Interception of these high altitude aircraft was difficult , and none were lost on 15 September 1940 .

 The offensive got underway at 10 : 10 in the morning . Major Alois Lindmayr Gruppenkommandeur ( Group Commander ) of I. / KG 76 led the entire formation . Lindmayr was an experienced combat veteran having won the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross for his effective low @-@ level attacks in France . III . / Kampfgeschwader 76 ( KG 76 ) took off with 19 Do 17s from their base at Cormeilles @-@ en @-@ Vexin . At the same time , 20 mi ( 32 km ) to the north , I. / KG 76 took off . Usually a Gruppe ( Group ) could field 27 bombers . After weeks of attrition , I. / KG 76 could put up only eight Do 17s . The Geschwader had to field two Gruppen to do the work of one . Most of the Dorniers were in bad shape , and were worn down by intensive operations . The two groups rendezvoused at Amiens then proceeded to Cap Gris Nez to pick up their Bf 109 fighter escort . As the attacks on Britain had caused heavy losses to the Luftwaffe , German crews and Geschwader experimented with innovative ways to defend themselves . One pilot , Feldwebel Rolf <unk> , had his Dornier fitted with an infantry flame thrower in its tail . If it failed to down a fighter that got too close , it might drive the enemy off : if it worked , it could be fitted to other bombers . After take @-@ off the formation broke up in cloud and was delayed for 10 minutes to allow reforming . Two bombers failed to do and returned to base .

 Initially , the operations room at RAF Uxbridge was disturbed by a visit from Prime Minister Winston Churchill . Most of the plotting tables were bare , save for a few plots indicating German reconnaissance machines . Most of the Women 's Auxiliary Air Force ( WAAF ) were relaxing , in spite of Churchill ’ s presence ( he had ordered that they not behave any differently ) . However , at 10 : 30 the first German aircraft triggered the alarm at Chain Home radar station at Dover . The filter room at Stanmore recognised the formation as hostile . The WAAF detailed group and sector commands throughout the south that 40 @-@ plus enemy aircraft were entering Kentish airspace . 
 By 11 : 04 , Lindmayr 's Dorniers had reached Calais . Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke , Park ’ s senior fighter controller , watched with the Prime Minister and Park as the Germans moved closer . De Broke had a problem of his own . He had no way of knowing which plots represented bombers and fighters . Bombers had to be intercepted , fighters could be ignored . The trick was to strike a balance and time the interception as well as possible . On one hand he must scramble early and allow enough time to get into a favourable attack position ; but on the other hand he had to avoid scrambling them too early lest the fighters run short of fuel before they met the enemy . Park joined de Broke . After a brief discussion he decided to commit several squadrons from RAF Biggin Hill . Park realised the raid could be a trap . Though the target seemed to be London , the aircraft , comprising 120 – 150 in number , may be an advanced guard of Bf 109s sent to clear the skies or disrupt fighter defences . Still , he gambled and sent nine squadrons into action at 11 : 15 . 
 No. 92 Squadron RAF and No. 72 Squadron RAF scrambled Spitfires from Biggin Hill . Their orders were to cover the air space over Canterbury at 25 @,@ 000 ft ( 7 @,@ 600 m ) . De Broke sensed by this time that nothing else was coming in . If this was the main attack , he decided it must be met with force . He ordered squadrons from RAF Northolt , RAF Kenley and RAF Debden to stand by . At 11 : 20 , he ordered RAF Hornchurch and RAF North Weald and No. 10 Group ’ s RAF Middle Wallop into the air . Park now had two squadrons over Canterbury , four over Biggin Hill and Maidstone with further back up of two squadrons over Chelmsford at 15 @,@ 000 ft ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) . 
 The plan was for Nos. 72 and 92 to engage the high escort . No. 603 Squadron RAF would arrive on the scene just afterward and get at the close escort ( JG 3 ) . The pair from North Weald would go to Maidstone , so if the bombers got through , they would run into them over London . Despite Park ’ s reservations about Leigh @-@ Mallory ’ s Big Wing , he ordered that it was time for it to be tested . If the Germans attempted to use the Thames Estuary as a navigation aid , as so often before , fighters from 12 Group ’ s RAF Duxford could meet them over Hornchurch at 20 @,@ 000 ft ( 6 @,@ 100 m ) . They would have a 5 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) height advantage to the west of the bombers and attack out of the Sun , if Leigh @-@ Mallory could get them there in time . The order was sent to Stanmore at 11 : 20 and Duxford scrambled No. 19 , 310 , 302 and No. 611 Squadron RAF . No. 242 Squadron RAF ’ s leader , Wing Commander Douglas Bader led the assault with the 56 fighters . They were airborne at 11 : 22 . 
 = = = Close to contact = = = 
 The Dorniers were supported by a German fighter aircraft that had been sent out in advance of the main strike . Jagdgeschwader 27 ( JG 27 ) and I. / Jagdgeschwader 52 ( JG 52 ) Bf 109s flew in toward London at 16 @,@ 000 ft ( 4 @,@ 900 m ) , while Jagdgeschwader 53 ( JG 53 ) flew top cover over the bombers . Some 30 Jagdgeschwader 3 ( JG 3 ) flew close escort . The bombers were travelling slowly , forcing the fighters to lower their flaps to stay with the bombers , which made them sitting ducks . They crossed the coast at Folkestone at 11 : 36 . Fighters from <unk> 2 ( Demonstration Wing 2 ) were also to form part of the escort . They flew in advance of the main force to drop 550 lb ( 250 kg ) bombs and then resume their role as fighters . The strong head wind slowed the Dorniers , which meant that the Germans took even longer to reach the target while burning up the Bf 109s ' limited fuel supplies . It also speeded up the RAF fighters coming in from the north . 
 LG 2 took off as the bombers crossed the English coast . Even with bombs , the Bf 109s were expected to overhaul the bombers and attack London a few minutes before the main raids began . Park interpreted the LG 2 raid as a major thrust and was determined to meet the " second wave " as he saw it . He scrambled six more squadrons but kept four reserve squadrons at Hornchurch and RAF Tangmere . As the forces closed , around 120 Bf 109s and 25 Do 17s were facing 245 Spitfires and Hurricanes . 
 = = = Combat = = = 
 Park 's plan worked . The Biggin Hill squadrons , 72 and 92 Squadrons made contact with the enemy over Canterbury . Arriving at 25 @,@ 000 ft ( 7 @,@ 600 m ) , they found themselves 3 @,@ 000 ft ( 910 m ) above the top covering German fighters ( JG 53 ) . Beyond Canterbury , they could also see KG 76 and JG 3 over Ashford . At 11 : 50 , they attacked out of the sun . Taken by surprise , four or five of I. / JG 53s Bf 109s were hit by the Spitfires . Spitfires of 92 Squadron tried to charge through the fighter screen to get at the Dorniers but were blocked . Soon afterwards , No. 603 Squadron joined the fight . Park had broken up the top level escort . Some 23 Hurricanes of Nos. 253 and 501 Squadrons arrived at the same height as the bombers and delivered a head @-@ on attack . Lindmayr 's crews were experienced and the formation held its nerve and remained intact . JG 3 in turn attacked the Hurricanes dispatching two from 501 Squadron . Northolt 's No. 229 and No. 303 Squadron RAF were also arriving and engaged JG 52 . One of 239 Squadrons Hurricanes and a JG 52 Bf 109 collided . The bombers ploughed on and reached Lewisham . However , the formation was now isolated . The escorts were embroiled in dogfights all over Kent and half the RAF fighters were yet to engage . JG 53 were further engaged by several squadrons ; Nos. 1 , No. 46 , No. 249 and No. 605 Squadron RAF . No. 605 , led by Archie McKellar broke away and delivered a 12 @-@ fighter attack scoring some hits on the bombers . JG 27 meanwhile suffered two casualties , one possibly against No. 19 Squadron . It claimed only one British fighter that day . JG 3 claimed two fighters for one loss . 
 Up until now , the Bf 109s had successfully blocked attacks on the bombers . However , Park 's tactics of attacking the Germans all along the route forced their fighters to use up fuel more quickly in dogfights . When the outskirts of London came into view , they began to depart at 12 : 07 north of Lewisham . 
 The North Weald pair , No. 504 and 257 Squadrons engaged the Dorniers with 20 Hurricanes . One German pilot , Feldwebel Robert Zehbe developed engine trouble and lagged half a mile behind the main bomber stream . He was set upon and shot down . As he bailed out he set the aircraft on autopilot . He landed near The Oval and was severely wounded by a civilian mob . He was rescued by the British Army but died of his wounds . His Dornier meanwhile flew on empty and attracted a swarm of fighters . Eventually Ray Holmes of 504 Squadron , out of bullets , rammed the bomber . The tail came off and air pressure snapped off the outer wings short of the engines . The bomber crashed onto the forecourt of London Victoria station . During its spinning dive , the gravitational force on the Dornier caused its bombs to be released , which hit or landed near to Buckingham Palace nearby , damaging the building . Holmes survived . 
 Directly over the target , Bader 's Duxford Wing arrived and attacked while the Germans were on the bomb @-@ run . Thirty seconds after the release of the bombs , they hit the target area , the Battersea rail lines next to Battersea Park on the Thames south bank . Each Dornier 's payload of twenty 110 lb ( 50 kg ) bombs carved a run 500 yd ( 460 m ) long and 25 yd ( 23 m ) wide . Some fell on the high @-@ density civilian housing . The bombs missed Clapham Junction but fell across the rail network tracks that connected it to Victoria Station north of the Thames and the main line heading north east on the south side of the river . The damage done had cut the tracks in Battersea in several places and a viaduct had collapsed over some rails . Rail traffic was halted . Four unexploded bombs delayed repairs . The rail lines were only out of action for three days . 
 But within minutes , the Do 17 formation had been reduced to 15 aircraft and most of them were damaged . Six had been shot down and four were attempting to make a run for home . The remainder dropped their bombs and were met by a covering force of Bf 109s and landed back in France without further combat . LG 2 meanwhile had been and gone . They saw one rail station and released their bombs and returned home . They saw only one British fighter , No. 46 Squadron ’ s Pilot Officer Gunning who reported the make up of the formation . Park had decided to ignore their raid . 
 Overall the attackers lost six bombers and 12 Bf 109s , some 12 @.@ 5 % of its strength . However , the British claimed 81 aircraft , 26 by the Duxford Wing . Zehbe 's Dornier alone was claimed nine times . Among the German casualties that day was Rolf <unk> and his flame throwing Dornier ; the device had not been tested at high altitude and when used , squirted black oil over Holmes ' windshield and attracted the attention of British fighters . Park would not have been pleased that despite being stripped of protection the small force of bombers lost only a quarter of its strength while surrounded by 100 fighters . Still , the operation had been a victory . Fighter Command lost 13 fighters , eight were claimed by JG 52 . 
 = = Interlude : 13 : 00 to 13 : 45 = = 
 At 13 : 00 , the German formations were plotted making their way back to France . Churchill was delighted with the results . The WAAF had been due to change shift , but the scheduled relief time could not take place during an operation . By 13 : 05 the fighters were back on the ground . <unk> and refueling began immediately to return the machines back to battle ready status as soon as possible , while the pilots wrote their combat reports which including filing claims and details of their battle to the best of their recollections . Bader 's Big Wing landed . Owing to battle damage , 49 of Duxford 's 56 fighters were operational by the afternoon . 
 By this time , the German bombers were touching down in the Pas de Calais . Two were so badly damaged that they were written off in crash landings , bringing the total losses to eight Do 17s . Almost all bore the scars of battle . One machine had sustained 70 hits , another 200 . 
 In the afternoon , RAF Bomber Command abandoned more attacks on invasion ports because of insufficient cloud cover . Six Bristol Blenheims undertook an armed reconnaissance over the North Sea . RAF Coastal Command flew 95 sorties for anti @-@ invasion , anti @-@ submarine , mine laying and reconnaissance missions . Spitfires photographed every port from Antwerp to Cherbourg . They returned with evidence of a gradually increasing buildup of amphibious forces . All the Command 's aircraft returned . 
 = = Mid @-@ afternoon attack : 13 : 45 to 15 : 45 = = 
 Even before the Do 17s of KG 76 had touched down , the next wave was already just getting airborne . II and III . / Kampfgeschwader 2 ( KG 2 ) , ( from Boissy @-@ Saint @-@ Léger and Cambrai ) II . / Kampfgeschwader 3 ( KG 3 ) ( from Antwerp ) , I and II . / Kampfgeschwader 53 ( KG 53 ) ( from Lille ) and I and II . / Kampfgeschwader 26 ( from <unk> and Gilze en Rijen ) took off to target the West India Docks and Royal Victoria Dock north of the Thames as well as the warehouses of the Surrey Commercial Docks in the south . JG 53 and Adolf Galland 's Jagdgeschwader 26 ( JG 26 ) were to escort the bombers . The fighters met them as the bombers formed up over Calais . 
 The phalanx of the German bombers headed for Dungeness . At the head were 43 Do 17s from KG 2 ; next , a couple of miles behind , came 24 He 111s of KG 53 ; finally , a couple of miles further behind , came 19 Do 17s from KG 3 ; followed by 28 He 111s of KG 26 . The headwind was present again , and the 114 bombers battled against it . The German fighter pilots kept close escort . They detested the tactic . It handed the initiative to the British regarding how and when to attack . Moreover , if they were bounced by Spitfires , the Bf 109s would take too long to accelerate to full throttle in order to escape . 
 The German fighter escort consisted of five Gruppen from JG 3 , JG 53 and Jagdgeschwader 77 ( JG 77 ) . LG 2 Bf 109s flew top cover while Adolf Galland 's JG 26 and Jagdgeschwader 51 ( JG 51 ) conducted fighter sweeps in advance of the main bomber stream . For the sake of appearances ( the morale of the bomber crews ) , Zerstörergeschwader 26 ( Destroyer Wing 26 or ZG 26 ) flying the Messerschmitt Bf 110 flew close escort to KG 26 . It was twice as small as the formation that hit London on 7 September , but instead of having two fighters for every bomber , there were four . Nor could the German pilots complain about being tied to the bombers . Sufficient numbers of fighters were allowed to roam on free @-@ ranging patrols . 
 At 13 : 45 , Chain Home radar picked up the German raids . No. 11 Group scrambled one Spitfire from RAF Hawkinge on the channel coast . Flown by No. 92 Squadron Pilot Officer Alan Wright , his job was to climb as quickly as possible over the sea and act as a spotter . He was to report on the direction , height , composition and strength of the German formation . The radar operators assessed the strengths of the three largest formations at 30 , 50 , and 60 plus . Five smaller formations added up to 85 plus . In fact , the British estimate of 225 aircraft proved too small . The German force was 475 aircraft strong . Shortly before 14 : 00 , the German formation left the French coast . Park ordered his forces to repeat the earlier interception tactic . Four pairs of squadrons were ordered to patrol Sheerness , Chelmsford , Hornchurch and RAF Kenley . 
 = = = RAF scramble = = = 
 At 14 : 00 , No. 11 Group released 68 fighters . Hornchurch 's No. 603 and No. 222 Squadron RAF committed 20 Spitfires to Sheerness at 20 @,@ 000 ft ( 6 @,@ 100 m ) . The squadrons would fail to find each other and went into action singly . At Debden , No. 17 Squadron RAF , No. 257 Squadron RAF sent 20 Hurricanes to Chelmsford at 15 @,@ 000 ft ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) . Kenley dispatched No. 501 and 605 Squadrons with 17 Hurricanes to Kenley at just 5 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) . North Weald ordered No. 249 and 504 Squadrons to cover Hornchurch at 15 @,@ 000 ft ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) . 
 Just five minutes later , the German bombers began splitting into three groups heading for the coast between Dungeness and Dover . Park decided to scramble four more squadrons . When it became apparent that five concentrations of Bf 109s were taking the direct route to London on free @-@ hunting patrols , Park scrambled eight more squadrons . No. 11 Group dispatched Biggin Hill 's No. 41 Squadron RAF followed by 92 Squadron . The force could put up 20 Spitfires . They were directed to Hornchurch at 20 @,@ 000 ft ( 6 @,@ 100 m ) . At 12 : 10 , Northolt No. 1 ( Canadian ) and 229 Squadrons sent 21 Hurricanes to Northolt . North Weald sent nine Hurricanes of No. 46 Squadrons to the London Docks . Biggin Hill sent another wave , No. 72 and No. 66 Squadron RAF , with 20 Spitfires to Biggin Hill at 20 @,@ 000 ft ( 6 @,@ 100 m ) . Debden was called into action again and ordered No. 73 Squadron RAF to Maidstone at 15 @,@ 000 ft ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) . Beginning at 12 : 15 , Kenley dispatched No. 253 Squadron RAF with nine Hurricanes to guard the airfield . RAF Tangmere was in action for the first time , sending Nos. 213 and No. 607 Squadron RAF 's 23 Hurricanes to defend Kenley and Biggin Hill . The largest contingent came from No. 12 Group . Duxford , or the " Big Wing " , No. 19 , 242 , 302 , 310 and 311 Squadrons with 20 Spitfires and 27 Hurricanes were ordered to Hornchurch at 25 @,@ 000 ft ( 7 @,@ 600 m ) . Middle Wallop committed No. 238 Squadron and 12 Hurricanes to the Kenley area . 
 By the time Park decided to launch his third wave , the first engagements were taking place . At 14 : 20 , he ordered No. 11 Group 's No. 303 ( Polish ) Squadron and its nine Hurricanes to <unk> at 20 @,@ 000 ft ( 6 @,@ 100 m ) . Tangmere scrambled No. 602 Squadron RAF and 12 Spitfires to hover over Kenley , Biggin Hill and Gravesend . Meanwhile , No. 10 Group RAF were ordered into action . A request was made for No. 609 Squadron and 13 Spitfires to climb to 15 @,@ 000 ft ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) over Kenley . This squadron left Middle Wallop at 14 : 28 . 
 The RAF now had 276 Spitfires and Hurricanes in the air . The Germans outnumbered the British in this raid by two to one . More seriously , for every two RAF fighters , there were three Bf 109s . 
 = = = Initial clashes = = = 
 Over Romney Marsh Nos. 41 , 92 and 222 Squadrons engaged JG 26 , losing one of their number to the Bf 109s . The second wave of RAF fighters arrived on the scene , comprising 607 and 213 Squadrons with 23 Hurricanes . They initiated a head @-@ on attack against the Do 17s of KG 3 . A Hurricane and a Dornier collided , both going down . The Bf 109s did their best to break up attacks and the bombers held a tight formation , putting up withering cross @-@ fire . The Bf 109s were not permitted to leave the bombers and chase enemy fighters . Time and again , they were forced to break off and return to the bomber stream , allowing the RAF fighters to return and repeat the process . Soon after , No. 605 and No. 501 Squadron arrived with 14 Hurricanes . One fighter was hit by return fire , but the pilot aimed his aircraft at a Dornier and bailed out . The fighter collided and destroyed the bomber . The German bomber crews had no way of knowing that the crashes were not premeditated . It seemed as if the British were desperate . Nevertheless , they thought the ' tactic ' was devastatingly effective . Chastened by losses , the Dorniers closed ranks to snuff out the gaps and continued to their target . 
 At 14 : 31 , they reached the Thames and British AAA defences opened up . The bombers were forced to evade their fire . One Dornier was damaged . KG 53 lost a He 111 following up KG 3 over the area . 
 At 14 : 35 , Park and Churchill watched the battle unfold in Uxbridge 's operations room . The Prime Minister saw that every squadron was being used and asked what reserves were available . Park said there were none . He was referring only to 11 Group , as there were more aircraft in nearby sectors , but at this point Park was stretched . At Park 's request , he had sent all the Squadrons from No. 10 and 12 Group that were adjacent to 11 Group to the capital . If the Luftwaffe launched a follow up attack , there were only three Squadrons available , in 12 and 10 Group ( based in Norfolk and Dorset ) and none in the Kent region . All other day squadrons were based too far away to get involved . Nevertheless , Park knew that a low cloud base over RAF Croydon ( 2 @,@ 000 ft ( 610 m ) ) , Hornchurch ( 3 @,@ 000 ft ( 910 m ) ) , Northolt ( 3 @,@ 500 ft ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) ) , RAF Hendon ( 2 @,@ 100 ft ( 640 m ) ) and Biggin Hill ( 2 @,@ 000 ft ( 610 m ) ) would make a low @-@ level accurate strike the Germans ' only option . High @-@ altitude attacks were improbable . Possibly to create a reserve , Park ordered 41 , 213 and 605 Squadrons to return early though they had only been airborne for 45 minutes and had plenty of fuel left , even if ammunition was short . The vast bulk of the remaining squadrons were heading to London . A total of 185 fighters in 19 Squadrons were ready to engage . The battle would involve over 600 aircraft . 
 = = = Main battle = = = 
 In the vicinity of Gravesend , the right @-@ hand German formation comprising KG 3 and its trailing He 111s of KG 26 would bear the brunt of the next attack from 63 fighters from Nos 17 , 46 , 249 , 257 , 504 and 603 Squadrons . Nos. 249 and 504 Hurricanes went into action first . The first pass saw three Do 17s go down , including Ernst <unk> leading 5th Staffel ( Squadron ) . The Bf 109s escorting KG 26 could only watch , forbidden to leave their Heinkel charges . As the first attack finished , No. 257 Squadron led by Squadron Leader Robert Stanford Tuck attacked the Heinkels with nine Hurricanes . The escorts had their work cut out and were scattered . No. 257 targeted the badly protected bombers . 
 As 257 engaged KG 26 , KG 53 came under attack from No. 1 ( Canadian ) , 66 , 72 , 229 Squadrons . No. 66 attacked first followed by 72 and 229 . Some Spitfires climbed over the bombers to seek cover from the Bf 109s . The British were surprised to see an unidentified formation of Bf 109s continue on without interfering . Two He 111s were forced back to France and another was shot down . I. / JG 3 had nine Bf 109s providing close escort which eventually turned to protect the bombers . They claimed one Canadian Hurricane and one Spitfire from No. 66 Squadron . KG 2 in the left @-@ hand column came under attack from 23 Hurricanes from Nos. 73 , 253 and 303 Squadrons . JG 53 were alert to the danger and shot down one 303 Hurricane and damaged five more . No. 73 Squadron made a head @-@ on attack damaging one bomber . 
 Meanwhile , Park was hoping for Bader 's Wing to turn up and deliver its promised results . As soon as the Duxford Wing did arrive it was intercepted . Arriving between Kenley and Maidstone at varying altitude ( 15 @,@ 000 – 16 @,@ 000 ft ( 4 @,@ 600 – 4 @,@ 900 m ) ) , it emerged from cloud in the vicinity of KG 2 's stream . Galland 's JG 26 was directly above it . In a reversal of their roles , the Hurricanes engaged the Bf 109s while the Spitfires went for the bombers . While they failed to deliver their anti @-@ bomber attacks , they drew in the Bf 109 escorts and free @-@ hunting German fighters making it easier for other RAF fighters to reach the bombers . No. 310 Squadron lost two Hurricanes to JG 26 , one to Adolf Galland , as the battle became a confusing mess of combats . By 14 : 40 , the bombers reached London . KG 3 had lost three Do 17s destroyed and two damaged while KG 26 had suffered only one damaged bomber . KG 53 in the central column had lost one and three more forced to turn back owing to battle damage , while only one KG 2 machine had been forced to do the same . Despite the British presence , 100 bombers with 120 tons of bombs prepared to drop their bombs . 
 One of the reasons the bombers had sustained so little damage was the cloud base . Its density had made it difficult for RAF fighter controllers to direct their squadrons with accuracy . The same cloud that helped shield the bombers was to obscure the target area . Its base started at 2 @,@ 000 ft ( 610 m ) and its top reached 12 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) . The bombers reached the Victoria Docks , but it and the other targets were covered . The skies were clear over West Ham and the bombers concentrated on the borough , in particular the Bromley @-@ by @-@ Bow gas works . KG 3 , 26 and 53 dropped their bombs at 14 : 45 . 
 Most of the targeted area was three square miles in extent , bounded on the north by the over ground railway of the District line , on the west by the River Lea , on the east by the Plaistow Marshes and on the south by the Royal Victoria Dock . The gas works were targeted by KG 26 . Heavy high explosive bombs severely damaged the plant . Upton Park tube station was also hit and an electric sub @-@ station was hit causing a black out . Residential areas were badly damaged . KG 2 was unable to find the Surrey Commercial Docks . It turned away and dropped its bombs over a wide area . According to West Ham borough records , 17 people were killed , or died of wounds sustained in the attack . Another 92 were seriously injured , while 40 were slightly injured . As the Germans retreated back out over the channel , some bomber groups scattered while others formed uneven formations and were pursued by RAF fighters . With fuel dwindling , the Bf 109s headed back to France , unable to help the hard @-@ pressed bombers . 
 The German bombers that had been forced out of formation attempted to make it to France using the cloud as cover . However virtually all were destroyed . Four Do 17s and six He 111s were shot down by fighters that were now swarming over Kentish air space . The main formations withdrew as more RAF squadrons closed in . The escort plan held up , and 50 Bf 109s met the withdrawing units . Still , there were gaps in the formation . Nos. 238 , 602 and 609 Squadrons exploited them . No. 238 Hurricanes engaged KG 53 while the others shot down two Do 17s from KG 2 . Bader 's squadron also took part shooting down one Dornier . Two RAF fighters were lost to the escorts . Another source indicated the German fighters sent to cover the retreat made little impact and were hardly noticed by RAF fighters . It appears I. / Lehrgeschwader 1 ( LG 1 ) formed part of the withdrawal force . It lost three Bf 110s to No. 303 ( Polish ) Squadron RAF at 15 : 50 . No. 303 Squadron claimed three Dorniers and two Bf 110s while No. 602 claimed seven bombers and two fighters . Still , the RAF grossly over claimed German losses . They claimed 77 bombers and 29 fighters . 
 German losses on that raid had been heavy . KG 2 had lost eight Do 17s and seven damaged . Personnel losses of the unit amounted to 19 crew killed , nine captured and 10 wounded . KG 3 had fared little better , losing six destroyed and four damaged . Personnel losses in II . / KG 3 , 15 were killed , 10 were captured and four were wounded . The He 111s were to suffer lightly . One He 111 was lost , its crew was captured . Three more were damaged and two crewmen were wounded . KG 53 lost six Heinkels with another two damaged . It lost 12 aircrew killed , 18 captured and four wounded including Major Max Gruber , II . / KG 53 's Gruppenkommandeur ( Group Commander ) . The German fighter screen suffered as well . In the battle , JG 51 lost two Bf 109s , JG 52 a single Bf 109 , JG 53 lost seven Bf 109s and one damaged , JG 77 lost one and one damaged , while LG 2 lost two Bf 109s . Having lost two Bf 109s in the first raid , two more were lost owing to the pilots running out of fuel or being shot down in combat . 
 In total , the Luftwaffe had lost 21 bombers destroyed , and scores damaged . It also lost at least 12 fighters . The RAF had lost 15 fighters destroyed while 21 were damaged . Another source puts German fighter losses at 23 . 
 From 15 : 00 , III . / Kampfgeschwader 55 ( KG 55 ) took off from Villacoublay led by Major <unk> . It headed towards Southampton before diverting to bomb Royal Navy targets at Portland . British radar reported them as six intruders . There were actually more than 20 He 111s without fighter escort . They were intercepted by six Spitfires from No. 152 Squadron from RAF Warmwell . The bombers dropped their ordnance but only five fell among naval installations causing minor damage . The RAF fighters claimed one destroyed and another damaged . KG 55 9 Staffel lost one He 111P @-@ 2 ( one survivor ) and 8 Staffel suffered one bomber damaged and one of the crew killed . 
 = = Evening and night actions = = 
 There was one more noteworthy operation before the Germans ceased their attacks for the day . At 17 : 40 , 20 aircraft from Erprobungsgruppe 210 took off . It was picked up just off the Cherbourg peninsula as it made its way across the central Channel to the Isle of Wight . By 17 : 50 , it had reached St. Catherine 's Point . Nos. 213 and 602 Squadrons were patrolling nearby at Tangmere , where they were kept for the duration of the raid . No. 607 Squadron , also from Tangmere , was flying to the airfield over Southampton at 15 @,@ 000 ft ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) and No. 609 Squadron was on its way from Middle Wallop to patrol Portsmouth . At 18 : 00 , by which time the German operation was virtually over , the British dispositions were completed when No. 238 Squadron took off from Middle Wallop to patrol the airfield . 
 The German target was the Spitfire factory at Woolston . They arrived near it at 17 : 55 . The Southampton guns engaged them for the entire time over the target . When the Germans retired , RAF fighters appeared . Fortunately for the British , the Germans missed the factory . They did manage to rupture a number of gas and water mains while damaging nearby residential areas . There was slight damage done to the shipbuilding yard in Southampton Harbour . According to German records , 10 – 11 t ( 11 – 12 short tons ) of bombs were dropped . Had they succeeded in hitting the Spitfire factory , they could have seriously impacted British fighter production . As it was , nine civilians were killed , 10 seriously injured , and 23 slightly injured in the attack . 
 The make up of the formation is unclear . An eye @-@ witness , air enthusiast Alexander McKee , 22 , was drinking tea at a cafe in Stoneham when the attack began : 
 .... I went outside on hearing enemy planes . I counted them aloud . Ten . They dived straight on Southampton , without any preliminaries , through a barrage of gunfire , one after the other . Alfred saw a bomb released , then handed the glasses ( <unk> ) to me . The aircraft had twin @-@ rudders , and might have been Dorniers or Jaguars [ a bomber version of the Bf 110 thought to be in use at the time ] . The dives were fast but shallow , and they pulled out of them at about 2 @,@ 000 feet . It was not a dive @-@ bombing attack proper . Soldiers passing made inane remarks about ' nothing could live in that barrage ' , although the Germans were living in it , too . The barrage was quite good , but none of the Huns were brought down .... Very quickly and efficiently the Germans re @-@ formed and disappeared into the cloud . I have never seen a better bit of flying than those Nazi pilots [ sic – German ] put up – they got into formation like a well @-@ drilled team , in the teeth of guns . 
 Nos. 607 and 609 Squadrons engaged the Germans south @-@ west of The Needles . The British reported 30 – 40 Bf 110s with 15 Do 17s in support . The tonnage of bombs dropped suggested there were fewer bombers than claimed . The RAF fighters claimed four Do 17s . The fact remains that the Germans penetrated the airspace without interception and came very close to inflicting critical damage to the Spitfire factory . The radar had done its job and alerted No. 11 and 10 Group 20 minutes before the bombs started to fall . The fault lay either with the No. 10 or 11 Group controllers who were late in ordering their Squadrons to scramble . 
 More interceptions took place in the evening . The interception of two separate He 111s near London at 19 : 00 signalled the last engagement of daylight . It is likely they were on reconnaissance missions to assess the damage done in the attacks . The interception was made by No. 66 Squadron RAF . One of the He 111s was chased out to sea and was last seen flying on one engine . It was likely to have belonged to I. / Kampfgeschwader 1 ( KG 1 ) , which reported one He 111 destroyed upon crash landing back in France after combat . 
 Small groups of German bombers attempted to attack London in the afternoon , causing little damage . II . / Kampfgeschwader 4 ( KG 4 ) had one He 111 crash land near Eindhoven after combat with the crew unhurt . The bomber was 30 percent damaged . 6 Staffel Kampfgeschwader 30 ( KG 30 ) lost one Junkers Ju 88 to fighters when it crashed in France and another force landed after combat . I. and II . / Kampfgeschwader 51 ( KG 51 ) lost one Ju 88 each and another damaged . In the lost Ju 88s , all crews were reported missing . 
 Kampfgeschwader 27 ( KG 27 ) bombed Liverpool during the night at 10 : 48 . Widespread damage was caused in the city and neighbouring Birkenhead , but only nine casualties were inflicted . Elsewhere damage was reported at Eastbourne , Worthing , Bournemouth , Cardiff , Avonmouth , Manchester , Warrington , Bootle and Preston . RAF night fighters flew 64 sorties and intercepted two bombers . Neither the fighters or ground defences claimed any successes . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 = = = Overclaiming and propaganda = = = 
 Over claiming in aerial warfare is not uncommon . During the Second World War , pilots often claimed more aircraft shot down than was actually the case . The Air Ministry released a press statement on 15 September that 175 – 185 German aircraft had been shot down . The actual number of aircraft destroyed was ⅔ lower and significantly less than the number of German losses on 15 and 18 August ( The Hardest Day ) , in which the Luftwaffe lost 75 and 69 respectively . 
 At 20 : 00 , Churchill , who had returned to 10 Downing Street , was awoken . He received bad news from the navy . In the Atlantic sinking of shipping had been bad , but his Secretary informed him that all had been redeemed in the day 's air battle . He was told the RAF had downed 183 enemy aircraft for under 40 losses . 
 On 16 September , a British flying boat arrived in New York delivering news of a " record bag " of 185 enemy aircraft . The German Embassy tried in vain to correct the total . The Germans were ignored and the New York Times ran several excited stories calling for a military alliance with Britain and her Commonwealth . The Germans were slower in putting their story together . On 17 September , the Nazi Party newspaper Völkischer Beobachter announced that attacks had caused considerable damage to London . It claimed the Luftwaffe destroyed 79 RAF aircraft for 43 losses . This was also a severe over claim . RAF losses amounted to 29 fighters . 
 AOC 11 Group Keith Park was livid with the claim returns . As far as he was concerned , claiming 200 on one day was nonsense . He placed particular blame on Leigh @-@ Mallory 's Big Wing which had claimed one third , around 60 , of the 185 ' victories ' ( total claims were 81 in the morning and 104 in the afternoon ) . More damage should have been done to German bombers inbound to the target rather than destroying stragglers that were no military threat as they made their way to the coast . He complained that there were too many inexperienced leaders and interceptions were being missed . Things needed " tightening up " , that was Park 's lesson for 15 September . Park was aware the ratio of losses was 2 : 1 in the British favour . It had been a decent performance , but not Fighter Command 's best . 
 = = = Evaluation of the day 's events = = = 
 In the two main engagements , the fighter losses had been about equal . The big difference was the bombers losses . Fighter Command had had greater success against the afternoon attack rather than the morning assault , which it out numbered 2 : 1 . The ratio of German fighters to bombers had been 3 : 1 in the morning but 5 : 1 in the afternoon , so there were more targets . The more bombers Kesselring sent , the more were lost . 
 Kesselring was back where he started . Park 's handling of the actions was a masterpiece of aggressive defence , yet he was not under the same pressure as he had been in the battles during August when air battles were so confusing they were hard to control . A big set @-@ piece offensive played into his hands . 
 Leigh @-@ Mallory claimed the Big Wings had destroyed entire formations of enemy aircraft upon seeing them . He even claimed the RAF outnumbered their opponents in several engagements . In the afternoon battle , he claimed that the Wing could not get into position to break up the bombers in time and was intercepted by German fighters . Still , while that was true he also claimed his units had shot down 105 enemy aircraft and probably destroyed a further 40 . He claimed another 18 damaged for the loss of 14 and six pilots . 
 The claims were a massive exaggeration . But while the Big Wing had proven physically ineffective for the most part , its biggest contribution to the day had been its use as a psychological weapon . The German bomber units that had seen the Big Wing form up were quite shocked , and those crews in the badly hit units , including KG 2 and KG 3 , that had witnessed head @-@ on collisions with German aircraft were badly shaken . 
 A German victory on the Battle of Britain Day was unlikely . It could only have been possible if Park had made crass errors and had been caught on the ground . Stephen Bungay postulates that had the loss rates been reversed , Dowding could have replaced those with reinforcements from his C units and carried on . Moreover , during both major engagements Fighter Command had used less than ½ of its strength . It would have been able to meet the Luftwaffe again on the morrow . 
 Hermann Göring met his staff at Karinhall the following day for a conference . Their assessments of the air battle verged on pure fantasy . They concluded the RAF had withdrawn all available fighter units from all over the country to concentrate of London . The fact that the Western afternoon raids against ports were uncontested led them to believe the enemy was breaking . Another four or five days , they thought , would be sure to break them . 
 The OKL believed that the British were down to their last 300 fighters , with only 250 being produced . To stop fighter production , factories in Bristol were to be attacked . London was also to be subjected to round the clock bombing . 
 Theo Osterkamp pointed to the massed formations used by the British ( Big Wing ) , and put their use down to the ineffectiveness of the 15 September raids . Göring was delighted with the news that the British were committing mass formations to battle . The Big Wing 's use would allow the German fighters to engage and destroy RAF fighters in large numbers . However , the Germans had not realised this stratagem was by no means the uniform strategy in Fighter Command . Nevertheless , the OKL were still confident of victory . It blamed the bad weather and RAF 's last @-@ minute change of strategy for prolonging summer operations . Still , the Luftwaffe bomber crews were ordered to prepare winter quarters . The campaign turned to London for the duration of 1940 . It would witness some large @-@ scale daylight air battles , but it gradually turned to a campaign by night . It would become known as The Blitz . 
 = = = Hitler 's reaction and Strategic overview = = = 
 Hitler did not seem overly bothered with the outcome of the air battle . For him , Sea Lion had also been a huge risk , even with air superiority , and he had been convinced since the end of August the Luftwaffe would not achieve it anyway . The war with Britain would have to go on . He would maintain the threat of invasion until 1941 through the use of strategic bombing . Then , he would turn against the Soviet Union and eliminate Britain 's last possible ally in Europe . With the Soviets defeated , he believed the British would negotiate . On 17 September , he sent out a directive to the three armed services informing them of Sea Lion 's delay . On this date , the date for S @-@ Day had been 21 September . It was now postponed until further notice . It is likely that Hitler did not want to gamble his new @-@ found military prestige by launching a hazardous venture across the Channel unless the Luftwaffe had crushed all opposition . At the beginning of December 1940 , Hitler told the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht ( OKW ) that they could forget Sea Lion , although he did not formally cancel the operation until 3 March 1942 . 
 Göring had never believed in Sea Lion , while Hitler had never believed Adler could achieve victory without Sea Lion . Both went their own ways . Hitler needed someone to keep up the pressure on Britain , and Göring was willing to do it . On 19 September , Hitler ordered that no further barges were to be added to Sea Lion ports , but those under assembly were to continue . But the damage being done by RAF Bomber Command now meant sustaining the army in readiness was becoming a strain . The invasion forces were broken up and moved East on the understanding it could be reassembled with only three weeks notice . 
 There was no clear solution to combating Britain from the air . Göring had not given up hope of winning a victory by airborne assault . He discussed the possibility of invading Ireland ( Fall Grün , or Operation Green ) with Kurt Student in January 1941 , in order to surround Britain by land , sea and air . The operation was shelved . Instead , the Luftwaffe , with varying degrees of success , carried out the strategic bombardment of British industrial cities . The lack of RAF night defences in this stage of the war enabled the German bombers to inflict extensive damage without suffering the heavy losses of the daylight campaign . It is estimated that the Luftwaffe lost around 500 aircrews during the Blitz in comparison to the Battle of Britain in which it lost around 2 @,@ 800 killed , 340 wounded , 750 captured . Overall losses were cut by one @-@ third of daylight operations . 
 Still , perennial problems with spares meant serviceability rates remained at about 50 % . The Luftwaffe 's bomber crews had never been trained for bad weather or night operations . To support them , navigation aids in the form of <unk> ( Crooked Leg ) were made available . They allowed German crews to navigate effectively to their targets . For the most part , crews were confident in using them , with the exception of poorer quality replacement crews . These systems were responsible for a few very successful attacks , such as the Coventry operation on 14 November . Operations against Liverpool were also successful . Some 75 % of the port 's capacity was reduced at one point , and it lost 39 @,@ 126 long tons ( 39 @,@ 754 t ) of shipping to air attacks , with another 111 @,@ 601 long tons ( 113 @,@ 392 t ) damaged . Minister of Home Security Herbert Morrison was also worried that morale was breaking , noting the defeatism expressed by civilians . Operations against London up until May 1941 could also have a severe impact on morale . 
 The campaign 's ultimate limitation was the poor formulation of military strategy . The types of targets selected from one operation to the next differed radically and no sustained pressure was put on any one type of British target . The Luftwaffe 's strategy became increasingly aimless . Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy . This method condemned the offensive over Britain to failure before it had begun . 
 The end result of the air campaign against Britain in 1940 and 1941 was a decisive failure to end the war . As Hitler committed Germany to ever increasing military adventures , the Wehrmacht became increasingly overstretched and was unable to cope with a multi @-@ front war . By 1944 , the Allies were ready to launch Operation Overlord , the invasion of Western Europe . The Battle of Britain ensured that the Western Allies had a base from which to launch the campaign and that there would be a Western Allied presence on the battlefield to meet the Soviet Red Army in central Europe at the end of the war in May 1945 . 
 = William Lax = 
 William Lax FRS ( 1761 – 29 October 1836 ) was an English astronomer and mathematician who served as Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry at the University of Cambridge for 41 years . 
 Lax was born in Ravensworth in the North Riding of Yorkshire . He attended Trinity College , Cambridge and graduated Bachelor of Arts as the Senior Wrangler and first Smith 's <unk> of his year . He was elected a fellow of Trinity College , ordained as a minister , and received his Master of Arts . Lax was granted the livings of vicar of <unk> , Buckinghamshire and of St Ippolyts near Hitchin , Hertfordshire , where he erected an observatory . 
 Lax was best known for his Remarks on a Supposed Error in the Elements of Euclid ( 1807 ) and his work regarding the Nautical Almanac , which was an important reference for navigation in the period . An obituary claimed that " To whatever Professor Lax applied , he made himself completely master of it " . His daughter married Andrew Amos and through that line Lax is the grandfather of Sheldon Amos and the great grandfather of Maurice Amos , a notable legal dynasty . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Lax was born in the village of Ravensworth , near Richmond in the North Riding of Yorkshire , England , the son of William ( 1731 – 19 August 1812 ) also born in Ravensworth , and Hannah Lax ( 1738 – 10 June 1811 ) . He was educated at the Kirby Ravensworth Free Grammar School , where he learned Latin ( in which he became fluent ) and Greek as well as English language , arithmetic and mathematics . Although the school was subsidised by a charitable trust , " Free " in the context of the school 's name meant free from all authority save for the Crown . 
 Lax was admitted as a sizar to Trinity College , Cambridge University on 22 November 1780 at the age of 19 . Trinity was at the time the richest college at Cambridge . <unk> were students who were not of the gentlemanly class , who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and / or lodging and other assistance during their period of study in exchange for performing work at their colleges . By the eighteenth century , <unk> were fully integrated members of the community , who were as likely to be employed by Fellow commoners as companions rather than servants . They were expected to wait at table ( as were pensioners and scholars ) , but by the eighteenth century they had their own gyps ( servants ) and <unk> . 
 Lax matriculated in the Michaelmas term of 1781 and became a private tutor to John Pond , later Astronomer Royal . Lax was elected a scholar ( i.e. one on a scholarship ) of Trinity in 1784 ; John <unk> and Henry <unk> were his tutors , a role which would have seen them not only teaching Lax , but also acting in the role of in loco parentis . Lax was conferred a Bachelor of Arts ( B.A. ) in 1785 and graduated as the Senior Wrangler and was awarded the first Smith 's Prize of his year . Until 1790 , all examinations at Trinity were written in Latin .

 = = = Early career = = = 
 In 1785 Lax was appointed curate of Tideswell in the Peak District of Derbyshire with an annual stipend of £ 35 . In 1786 , as was essentially the due of Senior Wranglers , he was elected a fellow of Trinity College . According to Peter Linehan , fellows at this time , " were becoming richer , living and behaving more like gentlemen " . He was ordained as a minister in 1787 at Peterborough and received his Master of Arts ( M.A. ) in 1788 . He was a moderator from 1789 to 1791 which entailed him presiding over oral examinations which were then necessary for the B.A. to be awarded . As a moderator Lax was responsible for the introduction of " very high flown compliments , and at the same time extending the disputations to double the usual length , which was around one hour and ten minutes " which " sent a ripple through tradition " according to Greg Dening . Dening argues that this was , " Lax 's way of getting into the act and making Acts flourish " . In 1791 he was appointed as a <unk> by the University . Lax was an assistant tutor from 1797 until 1801 , but resigned when he married Margaret Cradock , as College fellows were not permitted to marry . 
 = = = Lowndean Chair = = = 
 In 1795 Lax was appointed Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry in succession to John Smith . The position was a sinecure with an annual salary initially of around £ 300 , later rising to around £ 500 per annum by 1821 . Cambridge had two astronomical chairs , and the Lowndean was seen as the more theoretical and less experimental of the two . During Lax 's tenure a mathematical chair was seen as " a prize or a means of securing leisure , and at best , merely as offering a position where a man could pursue his own researches undisturbed by other duties " . In 1816 Lax was described as holding the professorship with " great reputation " . The sole duty of Lax 's professorship was that he was required to examine students annually for the Smith 's Prize , including John Herschel , Adam Sedgwick , George Biddell Airy and William Cavendish , 7th Duke of Devonshire . 
 During Lax 's time at Cambridge : " the mathematicians were in the saddle , and it would be difficult to dispute the judgement that they controlled Cambridge studies almost as completely as the logicians had done in the Middle Ages . " In early nineteenth century Cambridge " the discipline of mathematics was at the very heart " . Newtonian mathematics teaching as exemplified by " Cambridge traditionalists " such as Lax and his generation began to wane as the Georgian era drew to a close . In 1817 George Peacock successfully introduced the new French mathematics ( such as Pierre @-@ Simon Laplace and Joseph Louis Lagrange ) into the Senate House Examinations . Peacock reported to Herschel , " The introduction of d 's into the papers excited much remark . Wood , Vince , Lax & Milner were very angry & threatened to protest against [ the infiltration of ] French mathematics . " For the traditionalists the struggle was more than one of intellectual difference as for them , " Newton 's rational mechanics , <unk> , and experimental philosophy were an excellent antidote against materialism and atheism . " However , from 1816 to 1824 Lax continued to sit on the Peacock @-@ led board that established Cambridge Observatory . 
 Lax did encounter some criticism during his tenure . Whilst at the university he " never , as far as is known , delivered a single lecture " , despite his chair 's bequest that the holder deliver forty lectures each year , although his predecessor had not given any lectures either . The excuse was made that there was already an astronomical chair at Cambridge established before the Lowndean that already gave lectures . By the 1820s it was no longer acceptable to consider chairs as sinecures , and Lax received criticism from a living descendent of the original benefactor , Thomas Lowndes , for being remiss in his duties . His successor to the Lowndean chair George Peacock promised " to do his duty in a less lax manner than his predecessor " , and although he struggled to get anyone to attend his lectures on pure mathematics , his lectures on practical astronomy were well attended . However , Peacock 's translation as Dean of Ely three years later meant that he was largely absent from his chair , which he was severely criticised for retaining . 
 = = = Fellow of the Royal Society = = = 
 Lax was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society on 5 April 1796 . He was nominated by the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne , Anthony Shepherd , Richard Farmer and William Wales . However , due to an enmity of the President Joseph Banks , friends of Charles Hutton and Maskelyne , such as Lax , Samuel Vince and Thomas Mudge , frequently saw their submissions for publications overlooked . If any of them submitted papers to the Society : 
 they had the honour of having them carefully lodged in the archives of the Society , where the world in general , or even the members of the Society , would derive no more benefit from them than if they were deposited at the centre of the earth . 
 Lax delivered two papers to the Royal Society which were published in Philosophical Transactions . In 1799 he delivered A Method of finding the Latitude of a place , by Means of two <unk> of the Sun and the Time elapsed betwixt the Observations , described as containing " several valuable remarks " , but criticised as " a subject of no great importance " by the Philosophical Magazine . In his 1809 work On A Method of Examining the Divisions of Astronomical Instruments Lax wrote that no instrument was to be trusted without " previous examination " . This argument had an influence on scientists such as Henry Cavendish and was described as an " ingenious ... examination " in the Edinburgh Encyclopedia . However the method described by Lax " though very ingenious , requires great labour and time , and is inferior in accuracy and efficiency to that which was adopted by Mr. Troughton for tabulating the errors of the primary divisions of circular instruments . " It was also criticised for " greatly <unk> [ ing ] " a method first explicated by the Duke of <unk> . In 1807 Lax delivered Remarks on a Supposed Error in the Elements of Euclid to the Royal Society , however it was not published in Philosophical Transactions , but was eventually published independently . In it Lax defended the Greek mathematician against a charge levied at him by Georges @-@ Louis Le Sage in 1756 . Lax 's defence was applauded by the British Critic as ' perfectly sound ' . Lax also espoused the worth of Euclid 's Elements in the work , which he considered to reflect " the highest honour upon the human intellect " . 
 = = = Board of Longitude = = = 
 Lax was elected to the Board of Longitude after he was nominated to the Lowndean chair in 1795 , and remained on the board until it was dissolved in 1828 . The Board was a governmental body charged with administering a scheme of prizes intended to encourage innovators to solve the problem of finding longitude at sea , which was vital for accurate navigation . Lax published a set of tables for use with the Nautical Almanac for finding latitude and longitude ; these were published by the Board of Longitude in 1821 , and whilst they were not considered to be of much practical use for seamen , they were described by The Nautical Magazine as a " very meritorious attempt to solve the problems of nautical astronomy by one uniform system . " In 1821 , the Board awarded Lax £ 1050 for his tables , which were intended to replace Nevil Maskelyne 's <unk> Tables . However , the extraordinarily accurate chronometers of John Harrison were generally available from the 1820s onwards , rendering the lunar distance method , which Lax had used to create the tables , immaterial . Meanwhile , Edward Sabine criticised errors in Lax 's work . 
 As a scientific member of the Board , Lax was one of eighteen men who were , according to Edmund <unk> , " ultimately responsible for the form and contents of the Nautical Almanac . It would have been difficult in these years to select another group equally eminent in their field . " Lax was notable for his strong attendance record at the quarterly meetings , not missing a single meeting between 1822 – 25 , a record equalled by only three other members , although non @-@ attendance of meetings would have resulted in his not being paid his annual salary of £ 100 . In 1828 Lax appended An easy method of correcting the lunar distance , on account of the spheroidal figure of the earth to the Nautical Almanac . After the Board was dissolved in 1828 Lax unsuccessfully attempted to convince George Biddell Airy to aid in a campaign for its restoration . In 1834 a new edition of his nautical tables was published posthumously . Eva Germaine Rimington Taylor later concluded that all of Lax 's works were " of value to the art of navigation " . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 On 28 February 1801 Lax was granted the livings as vicar of <unk> , Buckinghamshire and <unk> of Great <unk> with St Ippolyts near Hitchin , Hertfordshire " after some years of teaching work " . He lived at St Ippolyts where he erected a private observatory which he had transported from Cambridge and had originally belonged to Isaac Newton . The Monthly Magazine included it in its list of the 21 most notable private observatories in England in 1813 . Lax spent the last thirty years of his life occupied with " studies and pursuits connected with the advancement of astronomy . " 
 When he arrived at St Ippolyts Lax had trees planted in the vicarage grounds in the form of his initials " W L " . That same year he created a park opposite to the vicarage similar to The Backs of Cambridge , built a replica of Trinity College Bridge , dammed the stream and opened springs to form a lake which was used for ice skating in the winter . In September 1801 he married Margaret Cradock ( 11 June 1776 – 20 January 1854 ) at the church in Gilling West in the North Riding of Yorkshire . Margaret was the eldest daughter of Sheldon Cradock of <unk> who was the lord of the manor of Lax 's home village of Ravensworth . Lax was a proposer of Robert Woodhouse , Henry Coddington , Herbert Marsh and John Bell for Royal Society fellowship , the latter being one of Lax 's closest friends , and he was a keen supporter of George Biddell Airy throughout Airy 's career . Lax was a chief supporter of the Whig John Romilly , 1st Baron Romilly 's parliamentary bid . In 1824 Lax purchased a coat of arms for himself . 
 His brother Thomas Lax ( 1770 – 1 Apr 1851 ) lived in Ravensworth . He was a gentleman farmer who became a record holding breeder of shorthorn cattle and at one point was credited with the best shorthorn herd in the country . He was " unquestionably a great breeder " . He also acted as Chief Constable of the wapentake of Gilling West . The Kirkby Ravensworth parish church has a memorial dedicated to Thomas Lax , as well as a memorial dedicated to the mother of the two brothers . 
 = = Death = = 
 On 1 December 1834 , Lax reported that he had been " of late in a very weak state of health " . He died " suddenly " on 28 October 1836 at his home in St Ippolyts . His obituary in The Gentleman 's Magazine reported that " his constitution was broken in early life [ which ] made his last years a period of weakness and suffering , so that his physical strength was unequal to the workings of his active mind . To whatever Professor Lax applied , he made himself completely master of it ... [ a ] most excellent and amiable man . " He left behind a widow and two daughters , the eldest Margaret and the younger Marian or Marianne ( died 21 June 1873 ) . In 1826 Margaret was married to Andrew Amos at St Ippolyts Church , and via that line Lax is the grandfather of Sheldon Amos and the great grandfather of Maurice Amos . 
 = Lad , A Dog = 
 Lad : A Dog is a 1919 American novel written by Albert Payson Terhune and published by E. P. Dutton . Composed of twelve short stories first published in magazines , the novel is based on the life of Terhune 's real @-@ life rough collie , Lad . Born in 1902 , the real @-@ life Lad was an unregistered collie of unknown lineage originally owned by Terhune 's father . Lad 's death in 1918 , was mourned by many of the story 's fans , particularly children . 
 Through the stories of Lad 's adventures , Terhune expresses his views on parenting , obtaining perfect obedience without force , and the nature and rights of the " well @-@ bred " . Terhune began writing the stories in 1915 at the suggestion of his Red Book Magazine editor . They gained in popularity and , as Terhune was under contractual obligation to submit something to Doubleday @-@ Page , he collected them into novel form . After Doubleday rejected the novel , he solicited other publishers until it was picked up by Dutton . After a slow start , the novel became a best seller in the adult fiction and children 's fiction markets , having been repositioned as a young adult novel by Grosset and Dunlap in the 1960s and 1970s . Selling over one million copies , it is Terhune 's best @-@ selling work and the one that propelled him to fame . It has been reprinted over 70 times by Dutton , and republished by a variety of publishers since its original release , including at least six international translations . 
 Contemporaneous critics praised Terhune 's writing style and the overall story appeal , while dog breeders criticized his unrealistic canine characters . In retrospective reviews , critics considered that the novel had aged badly , and that Terhune displayed little actual writing skill , but noted that the novel was able to hold long @-@ lasting appeal as it triggered the reader 's desire to have such an ideal dog . Terhune himself considered the novel " hack writing " and did not understand why it was so popular . Because of its reception , he went on to publish two additional novels featuring Lad and one featuring Lad 's son , Wolf , as well as many other fictional stories featuring dogs . Warner Brothers released a film adaptation in June 1962 . A series of four children 's picture books based on three of the stories from the novel were published by Margo Lundell between 1997 and 1998 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 " His Mate " 
 A rough collie named Lad lives at the Place with his Master , Mistress , and his mate , Lady . When Knave , a younger collie , is boarded at the Place , Lady begins ignoring Lad in favor of the newcomer . During a romp in the forest with Knave , Lady is caught in a <unk> trap . Knave leaves her there and returns home but Lad finds her . Several days later , the still limping Lady accidentally gets locked in the library and is subsequently blamed for the destruction of the Master 's beloved mounted bald eagle . The Master starts to whip her , but Lad intervenes and takes the whipping himself , knowing Knave was the culprit . Later , he attacks Knave for getting Lady in trouble , sending him fleeing from the Place . As the Master apologizes to Lad , Lady lovingly licks his wounds from the fight . 
 " Quiet " 
 On a cold October day , the Mistress falls into the lake and develops pneumonia . As the house must be kept quiet during her recovery , the dogs are sent to a boarding kennel , except Lad who is ordered to keep quiet . One night a thief breaks into the house , hoping to take advantage of the absence of the dogs . After he climbs through a window , Lad silently attacks him . During the ensuing fight Lad is cut with a knife before sending the man crashing back through the window . The noise wakes the humans of the house and the thief is arrested . After Lad 's wound is treated , he enjoys praise from the Mistress then travels some distance from home to enjoy a lengthy session of barking . 
 " A Miracle or Two " 
 One spring , a relative of the Mistress brings her invalid toddler , Baby , to the Place in the hope that the weather will help her grow stronger . Lad immediately befriends the girl and becomes her constant companion . By summer , Baby is growing healthier , though she is still unable to walk . One afternoon , the mother sits the child near the lake , then leaves her to go meet the Master and Mistress , who are returning from town . Lad saves the baby from a copperhead snake , but the distraught mother only sees Lad throw her backwards and begins beating him . To protect her friend , Baby manages to shakily walk to her mother and explain what happened . While the humans fuss over the occurrence Lad sneaks off and spends four days buried in marsh mud to draw out the snake 's poison . 
 " His Little Son " 
 Lady gives birth to three puppies , but after two die of unexplained causes , Lady lavishes all her attention on the surviving pup , Wolf . She later develops distemper and is taken away by the veterinarian , so Lad takes over the raising of his son , solemnly teaching him the Law of the Place . Wolf comes to love and respect his father and soon forgets his mother , though Lad continues to search for her daily . A month later , Wolf falls through the ice of the semi @-@ frozen lake , and Lad nearly drowns while saving him . When Lad staggers to shore , he is ecstatically greeted by the recovered Lady . 
 " For a Bit of Ribbon " 
 The Master and Mistress enter Lad in the Westminster Dog Show in New York , much to Lad 's abject misery as he dislikes the preparatory bathing and brushing . Dismayed to learn that Lad will have to stay chained to a small bench for all four days of the event , his owners begin to regret bringing him . To their joy , Lad wins the blue ribbon in both the Novice and Winner classes , and they decide not to subject him to the four @-@ day stay . When they let Lad know he is going home , he joyfully perks up . 
 " Lost ! " 
 Due to city regulations , the Master and Mistress are forced to muzzle Lad when they take him from the show . During the drive out of the city , Lad falls out of the car and is left behind . After he realizes he is lost , Lad starts towards home . Along the way he is chased by the police and a crowd of people , who presume he is rabid , but he escapes them by swimming across the Hudson River . Later he is attacked by a mongrel guard dog , but he refuses to run from the battle . He initially struggles to defend himself while muzzled , but then the other dog inadvertently bites through the strap holding the muzzle on , allowing Lad to quickly defeat him . When the Master and Mistress return from searching for Lad , they find him waiting on the porch . 
 " The Throwback " 
 Glure , a wealthy neighbor who considers himself gentry , stops at the Place for a night while on the way to a livestock show with a flock of expensive sheep . During the night , Glure 's " Prussian sheep dog " , Melisande , worries the sheep and they break free from the pen . Though Lad has never seen sheep , he instinctively herds them together while keeping Melisande under control . When the humans arrive to take the sheep home , Glure 's herdsman apologizes for having earlier insulted Lad and Glure offers to trade Melisande for Lad . 
 " The Golden Hat " 
 Tired of his high @-@ priced imported livestock losing in local shows , Glure concocts a dog show with a special gold cup event that is limited to collies that are both American Kennel Club blue ribbon winners and capable of completing the tasks of a British working sheep dog trial . Initially , it seems like the only dog who meets the requirements is Glure 's recently purchased blue @-@ merle champion , Lochinvar III ; however , the Mistress is able to command Lad through the motions of the trial . Lochinvar works primarily by hand signal , so when Glure accidentally burns his fingers on his cigar while going through the trial , the dog stops working and waits for Glure 's hand @-@ shaking to be explained . The dog is disqualified and Lad is declared the winner . The Master and Mistress donate the gold cup to the Red Cross in his name . 
 " Speaking of Utility " 
 Glure tries to encourage the Master to support the " war effort " by killing his non @-@ utilitarian animals , including his dogs . The Master quickly points out that Glure himself did not " sacrifice " his dogs but lost them to distemper . Pointing out that Lad had just chased off a trespasser from the Place , he fiercely argues that his dogs are his home 's best protection . A few days later during a livestock show , Lad attacks Glure 's new groom , recognizing him as the trespasser he chased away earlier . Lad 's attack frees a vicious bull , which goes into homicidal rage . Lad abandons his attack of the groom to protect him from the bull . The bull chases Lad over the river and consequently gets stuck in the mud . The Master quickly determines why Lad attacked the man and Glure grudgingly thanks them . 
 " The Killer " 
 Lad is accused of killing eight sheep owned by a neighbor . When the Master refuses to believe the accusations , they are taken to court where the neighbor 's farmhand testifies that he saw Lad kill two of the sheep . The Master successfully shows the improbability of a single dog carrying off six sheep in two nights and that the two dead sheep left behind were clearly cut with a knife , not teeth . After Lad is given a 24 @-@ hour parole , the Master asks the judge to accompany him to the neighbor 's house that night , where they discover that the farmhand was actually stealing the sheep , then killing one from each batch to put the blame on Lad . 
 " Wolf " 
 Wolf , the companion and friend of the Boy , is highly intelligent and an excellent guard dog . The Boy is upset that he is not allowed to enter the dog shows , though he understands that Wolf does not meet the breed standards . While the family is at a dog show with Bruce and Lad , Wolf is poisoned by an intruder . Having only eaten part of the tainted meat , Wolf is still alive when the thief returns to the house that night and is shot twice while protecting the Place . The thief escapes , but is later apprehended by the police while being treated for his bites . Wolf recovers and is given a " Hero Cup " trophy , to the Boy 's delight . 
 " In the Day of Battle " 
 On a cold , snowy day , thirteen @-@ year @-@ old Lad feels snubbed when the three @-@ year @-@ old Wolf does not invite him to join him and Rex , a five @-@ year @-@ old collie and bull terrier mix , for a run in the woods . Later , Lad goes for a walk , following their path . When he meets them on the trail , rather than letting Lad pass , Rex viciously attacks him . With his teeth dulled by old age , Lad is unable to really fight back . Refusing to just run , he defends himself as best he can while moving backwards towards home , half a mile away . Though Wolf betrays him and joins Rex in the life @-@ or @-@ death fight , Lad manages to get close enough to the house for Bruce to hear the battle and alert the Master and Mistress . The Master is forced to kill Rex after the crazed dog turns on him . After four weeks recovering from his wounds , Lad is able to go outside again and Wolf steps aside for him , acknowledging he is still the leader of the Place 's dogs . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The Lad stories tended to follow a persistent formula that Terhune used throughout most of his fiction . The main character was a " noble , almost saintly character " that could engage in battle , exact vengeance as needed , and displayed supernatural intelligence , loyalty , and understanding of the needs of his owners . Lad generally did battle with some villain , human or another dog , in defense of a helpless human or animal . Within each story , Terhune would speak in a positive , authoritative tone while dispensing various tidbits of information about canine behavior and thought processes . Injecting himself and his wife , Anice , into the novel , Terhune positioned the character " Master " as a " just , strict , well @-@ intentioned but often rather bumbling man " who could be overly sentimental and was balanced by the " wise , calm , and patient " " Mistress " . 
 One core theme of Lad : A Dog is the obtaining of perfect obedience without the use of force . Through the story characters ' attempts at explaining Lad 's inexplicable actions using " mythologies of atavism " , Terhune reflects his own views of an ideal relationship between a parent and child , namely an " ideology of noble instinct tempered by inflexible training " . An unknown third @-@ person narrator also reflects Terhune 's perspective and values regarding violence , which is both repelled and embraced . Reflecting patriarchy and the idea of a living creature that obeys unquestioningly and unhesitatingly , the novel indicates that " perfect obedience and submission to a master 's will " can be obtained without needing violence or force . Indeed , Terhune regularly decries the use of physical punishment to gain obedience . For example , in the story " His Little Son " , Lad takes over the raising of his son , using an even tempered , rational training system that reflects " discipline and firm kindliness " . In the end , Lad is stated to have a stronger , love @-@ based relationship with his son versus that of the pup with his mother , the temperamental Lady . Lady raised their son using physical force to impose her will , and thus after she leaves for a period , she is forgotten by him as he holds no love for her . 
 Within the novel , the Law forbids violence between the inhabitants of the Place . Despite its seemingly unyielding nature , it is in fact broken several times , though always with " good reason " . In the story " His Mate " , Lad meets and later must win the heart of his mate , Lady . Lad is clearly " enthralled " by the adult Lady 's sexual appeal . As Terhune seems reluctant to note the facts of canine mating , Lady is never stated to actually go into heat . Instead the relationship is framed within the context of a " human courtly love triangle " when the " showy " Knave comes to the Place and Lady forgets Lad and fawns on the new arrival . When Lady is believed to have destroyed a beloved mounted bald eagle , the master breaks the rules against violence and intends to beat her . Lad , in turn , breaks the rules of perfect obedience and growls , becoming the object of punishment and taking the beating in her stead . At the end of the story , when the master realizes he was mistaken , he apologizes to Lad for beating the wrong dog . Despite the novel 's overall theme of nonviolence , the master 's " unreasonable attachment to the bird " becomes the motivation for his " cruelty toward the helpless dogs " , yet Lad perceives the Master 's actions as " reasonable and functional " . Though the numerous tenets of the Law forbid violence in various forms , if the dogs harm something of sentimental value it is deemed justifiable to treat them with " any amount of violence . " This change is seen as reflecting a lack of maturity in the Master , and his having a " childish fixation on having his own way " , showing a desire to have control and order over that which can never be perfectly ordered : everyday life . Throughout many of the stories , a consistent theme is the Master 's imposition of will , behind which is the " blind rage of a child who cannot get exactly what he wants . " 
 The dogs of the Place are trained and commanded to control any violent outbursts against the Place 's occupants or guests , yet Lad 's engaging acceptable targets is written to " glamorize " the use of violence . Throughout the novel , Lad is victorious in battles against two thieves , a runaway bull , an " invading Negro " , and four other dogs , including a battle against two dogs at once . Each of the battles is referred to as a death match , with intricate detail on the tactics and strengths of a fighting collie . Terhune paints him as a " noble savage " who is " human @-@ like , but better than human " and who worships , and is worshiped by , his humans . 
 Another theme frequently reflected is that of " breeding " , in several senses : " pedigree , an inborn sense of manners and behavior , and , elliptically , sex . " Showcasing contemporary views of " entitlement and noblesse oblige , the novel reflects Terhune 's place as a member of the aristocracy and attempts to " justify the natural rights of the well @-@ bred . " The Place is owned by a rich family , that needs to be guarded against threats by foreigners , thieves of all varieties , Negroes , poachers , and the homeless . Within the novel , Terhune notes the provisions of the " Guest Law " , which reflect a fear of " the flotsam of the American polity " . In the character Hamilcar Q. Glure , shows his dislike for the nouveaux riches , those with " new money " , over those born and bred into wealth . 
 The novel also focuses on competition in the venues of the dog shows and combat . Within the novel , despite disliking shows and being an " old style " collie , Lad 's " sheer noble nature " enables him to win despite the going preferences for " more superficial qualities " . Lad obeys the Law in part because of his heredity as a purebred , and the Master considers himself a thoroughbred due to his having certain " race characteristics that are ingrained in his blood . " Frequently , Terhune references atavism , attributing Lad 's calling upon hereditary instincts to the presence of " a strain of wolf " in the brains of all collies . This idea also reflects the power of humans over nature . 
 = = History = = 
 Albert Payson Terhune was an established newspaperman and author of several books in various genres — including histories and thrillers — when he penned his first canine short story , His Mate . Ray Long , then editor for Red Book Magazine , had jokingly suggested he write a story about Lad one afternoon , when the reticent dog put his head on Long 's knee after having snubbed the familiar visitor for the last year . Having already tried to market the idea of his writing dog stories to magazines for several years , Terhune readily agreed . The first story featured three rough collies , Lad , Lady , and Knave , and used a similar formula to his previous works : an average male ( Lad ) protects a beautiful female ( Lady ) from a larger villain ( Knave ) . Long purchased the work for Red Book for $ 200 and it was published in the January 1916 issue . Four magazines requested similar stories , and Terhune complied , finding them easy to write and sell . Additional stories , all featuring Lad and titled Lad Stories , were published in the Saturday Evening Post , Ladies ' Home Journal , Hartford Courant , and the Atlantic Monthly , though Red Book remained his most consistent publisher . By 1918 , the stories had grown in popularity and Terhune was paid an average of $ 1000 each for the tales , with some selling for as much as $ 2 @,@ 500 , . Though marketed as fiction , even people who were acquainted with the <unk> and Lad reportedly believed that the stories were real . 
 In 1918 , Long began urging Terhune to publish a book of his dog stories , though Terhune himself was not convinced at first . He considered them to be nothing more than " hack writing " and inferior to his other works . Even after Long convinced him of the public 's love of the works , Terhune initially did nothing towards the goal . Later that year , Doubleday @-@ Page , which had published Terhune 's last novel Fortune , wrote asking to see his next book while reminding him that their contract gave them first refusal rights to it . Wanting to escape from that publisher due to the dismal performance of Fortune , Terhune decided to follow Long 's suggestion so he could use the book of dog stories to fulfill his contractual obligation . After he collected together the twenty Lad stories he 'd written so far , he reorganized them into chapters and submitted the book . He was unsurprised that it was rejected , but in the rejection letter the company referred to Alfred Ollivant 's 1898 novel <unk> Bob and Jack London 's 1903 novel Call of the Wild as " superior pieces of work " . As Terhune himself considered both authors to be unimpressive writers , he became determined that Lad : A Dog would be published . E. P. Dutton 's John Macrae , who was a known dog lover , found the stories " simple but charming " and felt the public would like them greatly . 
 Lad : A Dog was published by Dutton in April 1919 , a year after the real @-@ life Lad 's death . Terhune continued receiving royalties for the novel up through his own death . His wife , Anice Terhune , ceased receiving the royalties after she surrendered the rights to them , along with those of Bruce and His Dog in exchange for E.P. Dutton agreeing to publish and perpetually print her work Across the Line , a supposed set of conversations she had with her late husband . With this agreement , Dutton became sole owners of the copyright to Lad : A Dog . Macrae later decided that the agreement was not completely fair to Anice and modified it to provide her a payment of $ 100 a month for the rest of her life , likely exceeding the profits they earned on the novels as the years passed . 
 = = = Real @-@ life Lad = = = 
 Available evidence indicates that the real Lad was born in December 1902 and passed through the hands of at least two owners before coming to Sunnybank . An article in a Terhune family scrapbook indicates that he was likely a mature dog by the time he arrived , possibly not until after Albert Payson Terhune had purchased the Pompton Lakes , New Jersey property from his mother in 1909 . 
 Unlike the fictional Lad , he was not registered with the American Kennel Club and was not a show dog . His pedigree was reportedly lost by one of his previous owners , though there was no doubt he was a purebred collie . At one point , Terhune 's wife Anice claimed Lad had twenty champion collies in his pedigree , but this has never been confirmed . On July 4 , 1917 , Lad was entered into a dog show despite having no papers on his pedigree . It was the only show he ever attended and he won the Veteran Cup . As in the novel , Lad was extremely , even " hostile [ ly ] reserved " with strangers , wanting little to do with anyone outside of the family . 
 Terhune donated some of the earnings from the magazine stories to the Red Cross and Blue Cross in Lad 's name , earning the collie the Honorary Crosses of both groups . When Lad was fifteen , he lost his hearing , after which the other dogs in residence began ignoring him and vice versa . Lad died on September 3 , 1918 , having had a tumor in his heart for five years before his death . Lad 's obituary was carried on a multi @-@ page spread of the September 14 , 1918 issue of Field and Fancy magazine . He was buried near the driveway of Sunnybank , with the Honorary Crosses he was awarded . He was mourned by thousands of fans who had read Terhune 's stories , with dozens of readers , primarily children , visiting Sunnybank to see Lad 's grave . In one season , over 1 @,@ 700 visitors came to see Lad 's grave , prompting Terhune to close the place to visitors for the day . 
 After the <unk> died , Sunnybank slowly deteriorated , with the house and much of the grounds destroyed . Large chunks of the property were sold by the Albert Payson Terhune , Inc , an organization set up in the wills of Bert and Anice Terhune to provide funds for a charitable organization , the Terhune Foundation . The last ten acres of the property were eventually sold to a housing developer , which included the house , graves of the Terhune collies , and the dogs ' old kennels . In 1967 , this remaining chunk of Sunnybank was condemned by the Wayne Township . The next year , the township made the remaining acres a historical park , Terhune Memorial Park . The Van Riper @-@ Hopper Historic House Museum , located several miles away , displays Terhune 's writings , the awards won by the Sunnybank collies , and other memorabilia . The graves of Lad , Wolf , Lady , and the other Sunnybank dogs are preserved there and available for viewing by visitors . Clippings of Lad 's coat are stored at the Library of Congress , having been donated by Anice . Annual gatherings to Sunnybank are organized by the Collie Health Foundation on the third weekend in August , during which speakers familiar with Terhune and his dogs speak , seminars and tours are conducted , and various collie @-@ focused events and competitions are conducted . In 2005 , Marilyn R. Horowitz published a Sunnybank calendar , the proceeds of which were used by the Terhune Sunnybank Memorial to restore Lad 's grave , which had fallen into disrepair , and to aid in maintaining the grounds of Sunnybank .

 The original Lad stories were well received by readers of their respective magazines . After the appearance of His Mate in Red Book , the readers began demanding further stories . Editor Ray Long , who initially purchased His Mate , considered the story In the Day of Battle to be one of the top twenty to appear in Red Book during his time as its editor . The success of the stories propelled Terhune to fame , enabling him to purchase Sunnybank from his mother and quit a loathed job working for a newspaper to become a full @-@ time freelance writer . Although the novel was initially ignored by critics , within weeks it had become a hit . According to Terhune biographer <unk> <unk> , it received praise from most of the important critics of the time . The American Kennel Club Gazette reported that Terhune earned over $ 32 @,@ 000 from the publication of the Lad stories . Originally aimed towards adults , the novel was a best @-@ seller and gained critical acclaim in the adult fiction market . By the end of the year , the book had gone through 18 printings , and by 1935 , over 250 @,@ 000 copies had been sold . In 1939 an anniversary edition was released , marking its 71st printing . In the 1960s and 70s , the novel was repositioned into the young adult market , by dint of its animal subject matter . Grosset and Dunlap reprinted the novel in new editions that were prominently featured on their children 's book lists . By 1970 , these new editions had sold over 650 @,@ 000 copies , and overall Lad : A Dog has sold over 1 million copies and remains Terhune 's highest seller . Considered the novel that " propelled Terhune to fame " , it has been translated into and published in at least six different languages . Recorded Books released an unabridged audiobook edition in 1997 on cassette tape . In 2006 , Alcazar <unk> released a CD version . 
 Veteran dog breeders of the times were the primary critics of the novel , chastising Terhune 's depiction of an unrealistically perfect collie that would mislead the public into believing such a dog could exist . The anniversary and subsequent editions , featuring a sable @-@ and @-@ white collie , also drew criticism from loyal readers as it did not resemble Lad . New York Times Book Review reviewer Alden Welch felt the full novel would " surely appeal not only to all lovers and masters of dogs , but to many who have never owned any and who have no general and indiscriminate liking for them . " He found the stories " interesting " and a " most welcome addition to dog @-@ literature " , praising the novel as the most " delightfully written " of Terhune 's works to date . In 1968 , Sports Illustrated 's Robert H. Boyle stated that Terhune 's stories were responsible for many of the active collie breeders at the time getting involved in the sport . Calling the author a " godlike figure " and the hero of " goggle @-@ eyed youngsters of the 1920s , ' 30s and even into the ' 40s . " In comparing the work to popular collie character Lassie , Boyle noted that rather than having Lassie 's seeming immortality , Terhune 's dogs " led epic lives and they had epic deaths " . 
 In the Fall 1996 issue of Raritan Quarterly Review , Stephen D. Cox , freely admitting to never having read the book , nonetheless called Terhune a " hack writer " who lacked " storytelling skill " and denounced Lad : A Dog as non @-@ literature with " sentences [ that ] are insufferably stilted and hammy " and " have a tendency to wander off on long romps with his personal obsessions . " Terming it a " socially interesting " work , he concedes that the novel has maintained " intense and long @-@ lasting " interest from readers due to its successfully playing on their emotions and " desire to have a collie dog . " He quotes Irving <unk> , author of Terhune 's biography The Master of Sunnybank , stating that Lad " became the dog we always wanted to have and never did . Maybe even more than that — maybe he became the friend we always waited to find , or even the brother , or the father . " In You 're Only Young Twice : Children 's Literature and Film , Timothy Morris felt the novel had " dated badly " due to changes in American society , and while he stated that he enjoyed the work , in comparing it to Anna Sewell 's Black Beauty he faults Lad : A Dog for lacking an " autobiographical frame " and for leaving readers guessing as to what is happening .

 Building on the success of Lad : A Dog , Terhune went on to pen thirty additional canine novels , including two featuring Lad . Further Adventures of Lad , which includes the stories of his arrival at the Place and his death , was published in George H. Doran in 1922 . Like the first , it went on to become a best seller , praised by both new readers and existing fans . Critics , however , gave it more mixed reviews . Though some praised the stories and Lad , others felt Lad was unbelievable and harshly denounced Terhune 's writing style . Lad of Sunnybank was released in 1929 by HarperCollins , and included another selection of stories about Lad 's life . Two of the collies that appear in Lad : A Dog , Lad 's son Wolf and another collie named Bruce , both received their own novels . Bruce was published by E. P. Dutton in 1920 and Wolf was published by Doran in 1925 . 
 Published by Scholastic as part of its Hello reader ! series , Margo Lundell adapted three stories from the novels into a series of 48 page picture books with illustration by Don Bolognese . The first book , Lad , a Dog : Lad to the Rescue , was released in August 1997 and adapts the story of Lad saving the baby from a snake . The next two , Lad , a Dog : Best Dog in the World ( December 1997 ) and Lad , a Dog : Lad is Lost ( February 1998 ) focus on Lad 's first dog show and subsequently becoming lost . The final book , Lad , a Dog : The Bad Puppy , released in May 1998 , details Lad 's raising of Wolf .

 In the 1960s , Warner Brothers purchased the film rights for the novel from Max J. Rosenberg , of Vanguard Productions , who had purchased them from E. P. Dutton . They later negotiated with Anice Terhune for the rights to the two follow up novels , hoping to produce a sequel and television series if the first film proved successful . Starring Peter Breck , Peggy McCay , Carroll O 'Connor , and Angela Cartwright , the film blended several of the novel 's stories with some modifications to make a flowing narrative . Aram Avakian was initially selected to be the film 's director , but his refusal to create a sentimental dog story resulted in his firing ; he was replaced by Leslie H. Martinson . The film was released on June 6 , 1962 . Although it was praised by fans and modern reviewers , contemporary critiques felt Terhune 's work did not translate well to film , and it was considered a low budget B @-@ movie . 
 = Gun politics in the Czech Republic = 
 Gun politics in the Czech Republic incorporates the political and regulatory aspects of firearms usage in the country . Policy in the Czech Republic is in many respects less restrictive than elsewhere in Europe ( see Gun politics in the European Union ) . 
 A gun in the Czech Republic is available to anybody subject to acquiring a shall issue firearms license first . Gun licenses may be obtained in a way very similar to a driving license - by passing a gun proficiency exam , medical examination and having a clean criminal record . Unlike in most other European countries , the Czech gun legislation also permits a citizen to carry a concealed weapon for self @-@ defense . Most Czech gun owners possess their firearms for self @-@ defense , with hunting and sport shooting being less common . 
 The permissive politics have a very long tradition , with the term pistol originating in 15th @-@ century Czech language . The Czech lands have been the manufacturing center ( including weapons industry ) of Central Europe for over two centuries . Firearms possession was severely restricted during German occupation and subsequent communist dictatorship , with ownership rates gradually rising ever since 1989 Velvet Revolution . Today the Czech Republic is home to arms manufacturers that include Česká <unk> Uherský Brod and <unk> & Bellot . 
 = = History = = 
 The Czech Crown lands witnessed one of the earliest mass uses of firearms , in the early 1420s and 1430s by the Hussites who are even today revered as national heroes . <unk> 's use of guns , which had previously been used only during sieges of towns , as a field artillery in the Battle of <unk> Hora was first such recorded utilization . Use of firearms , together with the wagon fort , was one of the key features of Hussite war strategy , which defeated five crusades , launched against the reformation revolt . The word used for one of the guns used by the Hussites , Czech : <unk> , later found its way through German and French into English as the term pistol . Another gun used by the Hussites , the Czech : houfnice , gave rise to the English term , " howitzer " . 
 After the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918 , the country adopted the existing Austrian gun law of 1852 . The law was liberal , allowing citizens to own the guns without any formalities , with restrictions applying only regarding their number . However , carrying the gun was allowed only to the holders of a firearms license . Only a " harmless person " ( trusted person with no criminal record ) could get a firearms license . There was also a list of restricted firearms , such as <unk> , air guns and other weapons considered as " insidious " . Distinctly more restrictive gun law was prepared in 1938 , when the state was endangered by Nazi Germany and its fifth column ( Nazis among German minority ) but never came to use due to occupation of the country . 
 Gun ownership was seriously restricted during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia : at first , all weapons were seized , including the duty @-@ guns of police . Later the Nazis allowed limited armament of the police and governmental troops but forbade private gun ownership ( except for hunting ) and imposed very harsh punishments including the death penalty . Following the defeat of Germany in May 1945 , the more liberal gun law was officially reintroduced . But in reality the government sought to reduce the amount of weapons which were among people as the result of the war . For Germans and suspected collaborators , gun ownership was forbidden . 
 The situation changed again after the communist coup d 'état of 1948 . Although the law allowed for some restricted gun ownership , in reality the authorities were instructed about which groups of people would be allowed to own guns . In 1962 a secret directive was adopted , listing the names of persons deemed loyal enough to be allowed to own guns . Another more liberal law was introduced in 1983 , but gun ownership remained relatively restricted . Access to guns for sporting purposes was easier ( sport shooting was encouraged and supported by the state via <unk> ) and the rules for hunting shotgun ownership were relatively permissive . 
 The new enactment of 1995 , after the Velvet Revolution , meant a return to the more liberal times of the First Czechoslovak Republic . Accession to EU required a new law compliant with the European Firearms Regulation , which was passed in 2002 . The law remained very liberal despite introducing more regulation . 
 = = Current law = = 
 There is no constitutional right to possess firearms in the Czech Republic . According to a 1999 decision of the Czech Constitutional court , the right to possess firearm is not a basic human right and it may not be derived from the right to own property guaranteed by the Art. 11 ( 1 ) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms . 
 The right to have a gun license issued is provided for in the Act No. 119 / 2002 Coll . Subject to fulfillment of the act 's conditions , anyone is entitled to have the license issued and may then obtain a firearm . Holders of D ( exercise of profession ) and E ( self @-@ defense ) licenses , which are also shall @-@ issue , may also freely carry a concealed firearm . 
 = = = Categories of licenses = = = 
 There are six categories of gun license ; however , these should not be mistaken with the categories for guns . 
 A - Firearm collection 
 B - Sport shooting 
 C - Hunting 
 D - Exercise of a profession

 F - <unk> survey

 An applicant applies for a gun license at the police . If the conditions of age , qualification , health clearance , criminal integrity and personal reliability are met and a fee of 700 CZK per category is paid , the license shall be issued in 30 days . The license must be renewed every ten years ( no need to undergo qualification exam if the application is filed at least 2 months before termination of the previous license ; health clearance still necessary ) . 
 = = = = Age = = = = 
 To obtain a B or C category license , the applicant must be at least 18 years old .

To obtain an A , D or E category license , the applicant must be 21 .

 Obtaining the license requires passing a theoretical and practical exam . 
 Theoretical exam : The theoretical exam consists of a written test of 30 multiple choice questions ( selected randomly from a total of 488 questions ) with a maximum of 79 points possible . To pass the written exam , 67 points are needed for category A , 71 for category B or C , and 74 for category D or E. The test deals with the following issues : 
 knowledge of firearms legislation , 
 knowledge of legislation related to legitimate use of firearm ( e.g. self @-@ defense ) , 
 general knowledge of firearms and ammunition , and
