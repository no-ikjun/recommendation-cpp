 " Radio Bart " is the thirteenth episode of The Simpsons ' third season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 9 , 1992 . In the episode , for his birthday Bart receives a microphone that transmits sound to nearby AM radios , and also uses a <unk> to put " Property of Bart Simpson " on all his possessions . To play a prank on the citizens of Springfield , Bart places a radio deep inside a well and uses the microphone to trick the town into thinking a little boy is stuck in it . He enjoys the prank until Lisa reminds him of the " Property of Bart Simpson " label stuck to the radio . Whilst trying to retrieve it , Bart gets trapped in the well . Still smarting from his prank , the town leaves him down there . Eventually Homer decides to rescue Bart by himself . 
 The episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Carlos Baeza . Musician Sting guest starred in the episode as himself , though the producers originally approached Bruce Springsteen to appear . The episode features cultural references to charity singles such as " We Are the World " . Since airing , " Radio Bart " has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . It acquired a Nielsen rating of 14 @.@ 1 and was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network the week it aired . It was nominated for an Emmy Award , but lost to A Claymation Easter . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Simpson family are busy preparing for Bart 's birthday party . Homer sees a commercial on television for a prank microphone called the Superstar Celebrity Microphone that can be used to tap into localized AM radio systems and instantly decides to buy one for Bart. Subsequently , Bart experiences a crushingly disappointing birthday party when all his gifts turn out to be useless things like a cactus , a label maker , and a new suit . At first , he is also disappointed by the microphone , but later finds a use for it in creating practical jokes , such as tricking Ned Flanders ' boys into believing that God is talking to them , listening in on Lisa and Janey 's conversations about boys , and persuading Homer that <unk> are invading the Earth . 
 Bart plays a prank when he throws a radio down a well and speaks through it with the microphone , tricking the townspeople into thinking an orphan named Timmy O 'Toole has fallen down the well . Although they are unable to get " Timmy " out , as the well is too small for any adult to fit in , the entire town offers moral support and do everything they can to give him hope . Krusty even gets musician Sting to join other celebrities in recording a charity single , " We 're Sending Our Love Down the Well " . However , Lisa catches Bart in the act and reminds him he put a label with his name on the radio . Bart falls into the well while trying to retrieve it after Eddie and Lou unintentionally untie his rope . When the townspeople find him , he admits that Timmy O 'Toole does not exist . Angry at being tricked , the townspeople leave Bart in the well . After this , " We 're Sending Our Love Down The Well " dramatically falls off the number one spot all the way down to 97 , supplanted at number one by " I Do Believe We 're Naked " by Funky C , Funky Do . 
 Despite efforts by Homer and Marge to mobilize a rescue operation , the entire town remains outraged at Bart and are disinclined to help . After Bart cries , Homer finally has had enough : he decides to dig a tunnel and rescue Bart himself . Groundskeeper Willie sees this and joins Homer , starting an excavation operation . Bart is finally rescued ( with help from Sting and other residents ) and Willie puts up a small warning sign near the well the next morning to prevent future incidents instead of boarding the well up instead .

 " Radio Bart " was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Carlos Baeza , though series creator Matt Groening came up with the idea for it . The episode was based on the 1951 film Ace in the Hole , which sees the story of a former journalist exploiting a story about a man trapped in a cave to re @-@ jump start his career . Vitti did not watch the film until after the episode had been written ; " [ Groening ] came in out of nowhere and just gave me , start to finish , the whole story . " Vitti said renting the film was the first thing he did after finishing the script . He remarked , " It 's surprisingly hard to rent . It 's really dark and funny and it 's by Billy Wilder , so you think it would be in stores , but it 's not . It was hard to find . " 
 The producers approached singer Bruce Springsteen to appear in the episode because he had participated to the charity song " We Are the World " , on which " We 're Sending Our Love Down the Well " is based . Springsteen declined so the producers offered the role to British musician Sting instead . Executive producer Al Jean said Sting is one of his favorite guest stars that have appeared on the show and he " couldn 't have been better . He was really funny . " The Simpsons director David Silverman said Sting 's appearance in the episode worked for his persona because he has campaigned for political and social causes in real life . Sting was staying in New York City at the time of the episode 's recording so Vitti flew there to record the lines with him . 
 The television commercial for the Superstar Celebrity Microphone that Homer watches , was inspired by a popular <unk> Mr. Microphone commercial from the late 1970s , in which a boy becomes popular and " scores with the girls " by using his microphone to be on the radio . Both commercials feature a boy riding by in a car full of friends saying , " Hey , good @-@ looking , we 'll be back to pick you up later , " a line the staff thought was " hilarious " . In the Superstar Celebrity Microphone commercial , the boy sings the 1975 song " Convoy " by C. W. McCall into the microphone . The producers originally wanted him to sing " The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald " by Gordon Lightfoot , a song about the sinking of the bulk carrier S.S. Edmund Fitzgerald on Lake Superior . 
 Vitti said the reason the song was not used was because Lightfoot had made it so that in order to clear the copyrights for song , they would have to get permission from the families of the twenty @-@ nine crewmen who died on the ship . In another scene , Bart uses his radio to make Homer believe aliens are invading Earth ; Homer was originally supposed to create a punch made from Kool @-@ Aid and rat poison so that he and the family could commit suicide before the aliens arrived . The writers thought this scene was " too dark " and younger viewers might copy him . The scene was changed to Homer brandishing a shotgun and going after the aliens , before finding out that Bart is playing a trick on him . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 " Radio Bart " features several pop culture references . At the beginning of the episode , Homer watches the show Soul Train and its host Don Cornelius on television . The Wall E. Weasel pizza restaurant that Bart celebrates his birthday at is a parody of the family pizza restaurant franchise Chuck E. Cheese 's . The episode also parodies charity singles . The song " We 're Sending Our Love Down the Well " is a spoof of " We Are the World " , and the idea of celebrities singing it is based on USA for Africa , the name under which forty @-@ five famous artists recorded " We Are the World " . Funky @-@ See , Funky @-@ Do with their hit " I Do Believe We 're Naked " resembles the music style of Milli Vanilli . 
 This episode is similar to an incident involving Jessica McClure , who fell into a well and received support from citizens and celebrities . One citizen suggests using chocolate attached to a fish @-@ hook to save Timmy , a reference to a character from the 1975 film Jaws . Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times used " Radio Bart " as an example of the Simpsons writers ability to predict the future . He said " Radio Bart " aired more than five years before Princess Diana 's death that " provoked the exact same celebrity posturing and media panic " as seen in the episode . Timmy 's story is eventually bumped off the front page when the media discovers a squirrel who resembles Abraham Lincoln . Kay said Princess Diana 's death was " bumped by a fund @-@ raising imbroglio involving Vice President Al Gore , a political figure who resembles oatmeal , which squirrels sometimes eat . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 In its original American broadcast , " Radio Bart " finished 31st in the ratings for the week of January 6 – 12 , 1992 , with a Nielsen rating of 14 @.@ 1 , equivalent to approximately 13 million viewing households . It was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week . The episode was nominated for an Emmy Award in the " Outstanding Animated Program " category , but lost to Will Vinton 's A Claymation Easter on CBS . " Radio Bart " was submitted for consideration because it was the staff 's favorite episode of the season . Executive producer Al Jean said they thought this episode or an episode of Ren & Stimpy would win and they were " absolutely floored " when neither did . The Simpsons director David Silverman said he thinks The Simpsons and Ren & Stimpy split the vote , allowing A Claymation Easter to win the Emmy . 
 Since airing , the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . It was named the second best episode of The Simpsons by Kirk Baird of the Las Vegas Sun and the third best episode by Sarah Culp of The Quindecim . DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson commented : " Despite the potential for some heavy @-@ handed moralizing , ' Radio Bart ' provides a terrific show . From Bart ’ s crappy birthday to his pranks to the public reaction to Timmy ’ s trapping , the humor flies fast and furious in this excellent episode . It ’ s one of the better ones . " The Daily Telegraph characterized the episode as one of ten best episodes of The Simpsons . DVD Times 's Chris Kaye said " Radio Bart " is " another demonstration of the series ' knack for cultural references , parodying the Billy Wilder movie Ace in the Hole . " Entertainment Weekly ranked " Radio Bart " as the twentieth best episode of The Simpsons and commented that " it 's a media parody so sharp , we 're still stinging a bit . " 
 Monsters and Critics 's Trent McMartin praised Sting 's guest performance , calling it " humorous " . Total Film 's Nathan Ditum ranked his performance as the 11th best guest appearance in the show 's history . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , commented that " The Police had a song called ' Canary in the <unk> ' ( the episode contains a scene where a canary dies in the well , but is later determined by Dr. Hibbert to have died by " natural causes " ) , and Sting had made a point of campaigning for good causes , which explains why he was singled out in this sharp critique of celebrity posturing and media panic . " Tom Nawrocki of Rolling Stone rated the " We 're Sending Our Love Down the Well " song as one of the best musical moments in the history of the show .

 Holley auditioned to become a featured vocalist on the American reality television show Dancing with the Stars . The audition consisted of him performing seven different sounds , ranging from Frank Sinatra to Sly Stone . He was successful and became a featured singer during the first three seasons of the series . Holley later noted that the concept of diversity in vocal performance was not a new experience for him . " I 've been at sessions where a producer has said he wants me to sound like Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen at the same time . I 've had people say can you make it a little more green . Huh ? It 's tricky . " He added , " Sometimes they think they want Sheryl Crow , because she has a hit single .

 = London , Ontario = 
 London is a city located in Southwestern Ontario , Canada along the Quebec City – Windsor Corridor . The city has a population of 366 @,@ 151 according to the 2011 Canadian census . London is at the confluence of the non @-@ navigable Thames River , approximately halfway between Toronto , Ontario and Detroit , Michigan . The City of London is a separated municipality , politically separate from Middlesex County , though it remains the county seat . 
 London and the Thames were named in 1793 by Lord Simcoe , who proposed the site for the capital of Upper Canada . The first European settlement was between 1801 and 1804 by Peter Hagerman . The village was founded in 1826 and incorporated in 1855 . Since then , London has grown to be the largest Southwestern Ontario municipality and Canada 's 11th largest municipality , having annexed many of the smaller communities that surrounded it . 
 London is a regional centre of health care and education , being home to the University of Western Ontario , Fanshawe College , and several hospitals . The city hosts a number of musical and artistic exhibits and festivals , which contribute to its tourism industry , but its economic activity is centred on education , medical research , insurance , and information technology . London 's university and hospitals are among its top ten employers . London lies at the junction of Highway 401 and 402 , connecting it to Toronto , Windsor , and Sarnia . It also has an international airport , train and bus station . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Founding = = = 
 Prior to European contact in the 18th century , the present site of London was occupied by several Neutral and Odawa / Ojibwa villages . Archaeological investigations in the region indicate that aboriginal people have resided in the area for at least the past 10 @,@ 000 years . 
 The current location of London was selected as the site of the future capital of Upper Canada in 1793 by Lieutenant @-@ Governor John Graves Simcoe . Simcoe intended to name the settlement Georgina , in honour of King George III , and renamed the river . However , the choice of a capital site in the midst of extensive hardwood forests was rejected by Guy Carleton ( Governor Dorchester ) . In 1814 , there was a skirmish during the War of 1812 in what is now southwest London at Reservoir Hill , formerly Hungerford Hill . 
 The village of London , named after the English capital of London , was not founded until 1826 , and not as the capital Simcoe envisioned . Rather , it was an administrative seat for the area west of the actual capital , York ( now Toronto ) . Locally , it was part of the Talbot Settlement , named for Colonel Thomas Talbot , the chief coloniser of the area , who oversaw the land surveying and built the first government buildings for the administration of the Western Ontario peninsular region . Together with the rest of Southwestern Ontario , the village benefited from Talbot 's provisions , not only for building and maintaining roads , but also for assignment of access priorities to main routes to productive land . At the time , Crown and clergy reserves were receiving preference in the rest of Ontario . 
 In 1832 , the new settlement suffered an outbreak of cholera . London proved a centre of strong Tory support during the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837 , notwithstanding a brief rebellion led by Dr. Charles Duncombe . Consequently , the British government located its Ontario peninsular garrison there in 1838 , increasing its population with soldiers and their dependents , and the business support populations they required . London was incorporated as a town in 1840 . 
 On 13 April 1845 , fire destroyed much of London , which was at the time largely constructed of wooden buildings . One of the first casualties was the town 's only fire engine . This fire burned nearly 30 acres of land destroying 150 buildings before burning itself out later the same day . One @-@ fifth of London was destroyed and this was the province 's first million dollar fire . 
 On 1 January 1855 , London was incorporated as a " city " ( 10 @,@ 000 or more residents ) . In the 1860s , a sulphur spring was discovered at the forks of the Thames River while industrialists were drilling for oil . The springs became a popular destination for wealthy <unk> , until the turn of the 20th century when a textile factory was built at the site , replacing the spa . 
 Long before the Royal Military College of Canada was established in 1876 , there were proposals for military colleges in Canada . Staffed by British Regulars , adult male students underwent a 3 month long military courses from 1865 at the School of Military Instruction in London . Established by Militia General Order in 1865 , the school enabled Officers of Militia or Candidates for Commission or promotion in the Militia to learn Military duties , drill and discipline , to command a Company at Battalion Drill , to Drill a Company at Company Drill , the internal economy of a Company and the duties of a Company 's Officer . The school was not retained at Confederation , in 1867 . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Sir John Carling , Tory MP for London , gave three events to explain the development of London in a 1901 speech . They were : the location of the court and administration in London in 1826 ; the arrival of the military garrison in 1838 ; and the arrival of the railway in 1853 . 
 In 1875 , London 's first iron bridge , the Blackfriars Street Bridge , was constructed . It replaced a succession of flood @-@ failed wooden structures that had provided the city 's only northern road crossing of the river . A rare example of a bowstring truss bridge , the Blackfriars remains open to pedestrian and bicycle traffic , though it is currently closed indefinitely to vehicular traffic due to various structural problems . The Blackfriars , amidst the river @-@ distance between the Carling Brewery and the historic Tecumseh Park ( including a major mill ) , linked London with its western suburb of Petersville , named for Squire Peters of Grosvenor Lodge . That community joined with the southern subdivision of Kensington in 1874 , formally incorporating as the municipality of Petersville . Although it changed its name in 1880 to the more inclusive " London West " , it remained a separate municipality until ratepayers voted for amalgamation with London in 1897 , largely due to repeated flooding . The most serious flood was that of July 1883 , which resulted in serious loss of life and property devaluation . This area retains much original and attractively maintained 19th @-@ century tradespeople 's and workers ' housing , including Georgian cottages as well as larger houses , and a distinct sense of place . 
 London 's eastern suburb , London East , was ( and remains ) an industrial centre , which also incorporated in 1874 . Attaining the status of town in 1881 , it continued as a separate municipality until concerns over expensive waterworks and other fiscal problems led to amalgamation in 1885 . The southern suburb of London , including Wortley Village , was collectively known as " London South " . Never incorporated , the South was annexed to the city in 1890 , although Wortley Village still retains a distinct sense of place . By contrast , the settlement at <unk> on the city 's north end had a clear identity , adjoined the university , and was not annexed until 1961 . 
 On 24 May 1881 , the ferry SS Victoria capsized in the Thames River , drowning approximately 200 passengers , the worst disaster in London 's history . Two years later , on 12 July 1883 , the first of the two most devastating floods in London 's history killed 17 people . The second major flood , on 26 April 1937 , destroyed more than a thousand houses and caused over $ 50 million in damages , particularly in West London . After repeated floods the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority in 1953 built Fanshawe Dam on the North Thames to control the downstream rivers . Financing for this project came from the federal , provincial , and municipal governments . Other natural disasters include a 1984 tornado that led to damage on several streets in the White Oaks area of South London . 
 London 's role as a military centre continued into the 20th century during the two World Wars , serving as the administrative centre for the Western Ontario district . In 1905 , the London Armoury was built and housed the First Hussars until 1975 . A private investor purchased the historic site and built a new hotel ( Delta London Armouries , 1996 ) in its place preserving the shell of the historic building . In the 1950s , two reserve battalions amalgamated and became London and Oxford Rifles ( 3rd Battalion ) , The Royal Canadian Regiment .

 London annexed many of the surrounding communities in 1961 , including Byron and Masonville , adding 60 @,@ 000 people and more than doubling its area . After this amalgamation , suburban growth accelerated as London grew outward in all directions , creating expansive new subdivisions such as Westmount , Oakridge , Whitehills , Pond Mills , White Oaks and <unk> . 
 In 1992 , London annexed nearly the entire township of Westminster , a large , primarily rural municipality directly south of the city , including the police village of Lambeth . With this massive annexation , London almost doubled in area again , adding several thousand more residents . London now stretches south to the boundary with Elgin County . 
 The 1993 annexation made London one of the largest urban municipalities in Ontario . Intense commercial and residential development is presently occurring in the southwest and northwest areas of the city . Opponents of this development cite urban sprawl , destruction of rare Carolinian zone forest and farm lands , replacement of distinctive regions by generic malls , and standard transportation and pollution concerns as major issues facing London . The City of London is currently the eleventh @-@ largest urban area in Canada , eleventh @-@ largest census metropolitan area in Canada , and the sixth @-@ largest city in Ontario . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The area was formed during the retreat of the glaciers during the last ice age , which produced areas of marshland , notably the Sifton Bog ( which is actually a fen ) , as well as some of the most agriculturally productive areas of farmland in Ontario . The Thames River dominates London 's geography . The North and South branches of the Thames River meet at the centre of the city , a location known as " The Forks " or " The Fork of the Thames . " The North Thames runs through the man @-@ made Fanshawe Lake , located in northeast London . Fanshawe Lake was created by Fanshawe Dam , constructed to protect the downriver areas from the catastrophic flooding which affected the city in 1883 and 1937 . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 London has a humid continental climate ( Köppen Dfb ) , though due to its downwind location relative to Lake Huron and elevation changes across the city , it is virtually on the Dfa / Dfb ( hot summer ) boundary favouring the former climate zone to the southwest of the confluence of the South and North Thames Rivers , and the latter zone to the northeast ( including the airport ) . Because of its location in the continent , London experiences large seasonal contrast , tempered to a point by the surrounding Great Lakes . The summers are usually warm to hot and humid , with a July average of 20 @.@ 8 ° C ( 69 @.@ 4 ° F ) , and temperatures above 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) occur on average 10 days per year . In 2012 , however , temperatures at or above 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) occurred a total of 27 times . The city is affected by frequent thunderstorms due to hot , humid summer weather , as well as the convergence of breezes originating from Lake Huron and Lake Erie . The same convergence zone is responsible for spawning funnel clouds and the occasional tornado . London is located in Canada 's Tornado Alley . Spring and autumn in between are not long , and winters are cold but witness frequent thaws . Annual precipitation averages 1 @,@ 011 @.@ 5 mm ( 39 @.@ 82 in ) . Its winter snowfall totals are heavy , averaging about 194 cm ( 76 in ) per year . The majority of it comes from lake effect snow and snow squalls originating from Lake Huron , some 60 km ( 37 mi ) to the northwest , which occurs when strong , cold winds blow from that direction . From 5 December 2010 , to 9 December 2010 , London experienced record snowfall when up to 2 m ( 79 in ) of snow fell in parts of the city . Schools and businesses were closed for three days and bus service was cancelled after the second day of snow . 
 The highest temperature ever recorded in London was 41 @.@ 1 ° C ( 106 ° F ) on 6 August 1918 . The lowest temperature ever recorded was − 32 @.@ 2 ° C ( − 26 ° F ) on 20 January 1892 .

 London 's municipal government is divided among fourteen councillors ( one representing each of London 's fourteen wards ) and the mayor . Matt Brown was elected mayor in the 2014 municipal election , officially taking office on 1 December 2014 . Prior to Brown 's election , London 's most recent elected mayor was Joe Fontana ; following Fontana 's resignation on 19 June 2014 , city councillor Joe Swan served as acting mayor until councillor Joni <unk> was selected as interim mayor 24 June . Until the elections in 2010 , there was a Board of Control , consisting of four controllers and the mayor , all elected city @-@ wide . 
 The composition of London City Council was challenged by two ballot questions during the civic election of 2003 . A proposal to restructure the municipal government would have seen the council reduced to ten wards and the Board of Control eliminated . The council could not come to a determination and as a result decided to put two questions on the ballot for the fall 2003 election : whether city council should be reduced in size and whether the Board of Control should be eliminated . While the " yes " votes prevailed in both instances , the voter turnout failed to exceed 50 per cent and was therefore insufficient to make the decisions binding under the Municipal Act . When the council voted to retain the status quo , Imagine London , a citizens group , petitioned the Ontario Municipal Board ( OMB ) to change the ward composition of the city from seven wards in a roughly radial pattern from the downtown core , to 14 wards defined by communities of interest . 
 The OMB ruled for the petitioners in December 2005 and , while the city sought leave to appeal the OMB decision via the courts , leave was denied on 28 February 2006 , in a decision of Superior Court 's Justice McDermid . In response , the city conceded change , but asked for special legislation from the province to ensure that there will only be one councillor in each of the 14 new wards , not two . 1 June 2006 , the Ontario bill received royal assent , which guarantees that London will have one councillor per ward . 
 Although London has many ties to Middlesex County , it is now " separated " and the two have no jurisdictional overlap . The exception is the Middlesex County courthouse and former jail , as the judiciary is administered directly by the province .

 London is at the junction of Highway 401 that connects the city to Toronto and Detroit , and Highway 402 to Sarnia . Also , Highway 403 , which diverges from the 401 at nearby Woodstock , Ontario , provides ready access to Brantford , Hamilton , the Golden Horseshoe area , and the Niagara Peninsula . Many smaller two @-@ lane highways also pass through or near London , including Kings Highways 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 and 22 . Many of these are " historical " names , as provincial downloading in the 1980s and 1990s put responsibility for most provincial highways on municipal governments . Nevertheless , these roads continue to provide access from London to nearby communities and locations in much of Western Ontario , including Goderich , Port Stanley and Owen Sound . 
 Since the 1970s , London has improved urban road alignments that eliminated " jogs " in established traffic patterns over 19th @-@ century street mis @-@ alignments . The lack of a municipal freeway ( either through or around the city ) as well as the presence of two significant railways ( each with attendant switching yards and few over / under @-@ passes ) are the primary causes of rush hour congestion , along with construction and heavy snow . Thus , traffic times can be significantly variable , although major traffic jams are rare . Wellington Road between Commissioners Road E and Southdale Road E is London 's busiest section of roadway , with more than 46 @,@ 000 vehicles using the span on an average day City council rejected early plans for the construction of a freeway , and instead accepted the Veterans Memorial Parkway to serve the east end . Some Londoners have expressed concern that the absence of a local freeway may hinder London 's economic and population growth , while others have voiced concern that such a freeway would destroy environmentally sensitive areas and further contribute to London 's already uncontrolled suburban sprawl . Road capacity improvements have been made to Veterans Memorial Parkway ( formerly named Airport Road and Highway 100 ) in the industrialized east end . However , the Parkway has received criticism for not being built as a proper highway ; a recent city @-@ run study suggested upgrading it by replacing the intersections with interchanges . 
 London 's public transit system is run by the London Transit Commission , which has 38 bus routes throughout the city . The Transit Commission has been improving bus service over the years , but not enough to cope with the city 's growing number of riders during peak periods . Bus service is currently the only mode of public transit available to the public in London , with no ground light rail or rapid transit networks like those used in other Canadian cities .

 = Ventus ( Kingdom Hearts ) = 
 Ventus ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : <unk> ) , commonly referred to as Ven ( <unk> ) , is a fictional character from Square Enix 's video game franchise Kingdom Hearts . Having first made cameos in Kingdom Hearts II and other related titles , Ventus was introduced in the 2010 prequel Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep as one of the three protagonists . In its story , Ventus is introduced as the youngest apprentice of Master Eraqus who trains him alongside his best friends , Terra and Aqua , to become experienced warriors with the Keyblade . When Terra goes on a mission to find Master Xehanort , Ventus follows him , having also become concerned about his fate . As Ventus journeys through various worlds , he learns about his origins as well as his relation with Xehanort and his apprentice Vanitas . 
 Ventus was designed by director Tetsuya Nomura who wanted to create a character with an important connection with the series ' main character Sora . Ventus bears a strong resemblance to the character of Roxas , both of whom are voiced by Kōki Uchiyama in Japanese and Jesse McCartney in English . After Ventus ' first cameo , Nomura had to state that both of them are different characters , and the reason for such connection would be revealed in Birth by Sleep . Video game websites also commented on Ventus ' first appearance , initially confusing him for Roxas during the development of Birth by Sleep , but has since been well received . 
 = = Appearances = = 
 Before being introduced in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep , Ventus first made cameos in the secret endings of Kingdom Hearts II and its re @-@ release , Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix , which depicted him and his friends Terra and Aqua battling Master Xehanort and Vanitas . Ventus is also shown in a cameo in Kingdom Hearts 358 / 2 Days when Xion , a replica of Roxas , appears as Ventus while fighting Xigbar from Organization XIII . Ventus is also constantly referenced by Xigbar in Kingdom Hearts II and 358 / 2 Days while Xemnas , the Nobody of Xehanort , is in search of him in Castle Oblivion . 
 Prior to the start of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep , Ventus was the apprentice of Master Xehanort , who trained him to complete the legendary χ @-@ blade ( pronounced as " key blade " ) . However , due to Ventus ' reluctance to use darkness , Xehanort extracted it from his heart , resulting in the creation of Vanitas , but also leaving his heart incomplete and on the verge of collapse . He is brought by Xehanort to Destiny Islands , where his heart merges with that of the newborn Sora to keep it safe . Having lost his memories , Ventus is placed in the care of Master Eraqus as his youngest Keyblade apprentice alongside Terra and Aqua . At the games beginning , Vanitas taunts Ventus into following Terra who is on a quest to find Xehanort . Ventus travels through various worlds , fighting mysterious creatures called the Unversed and meeting various people . Vanitas attacks Ventus during his journey to test his strength , but he is defeated when Ventus is aided by the Keyblade apprentice Mickey . Upon meeting Xehanort , Ventus is forced to remember his purpose as being used to create the χ @-@ blade . Ventus refuses to battle Vanitas to avoid creating the χ @-@ blade , but is forced to after Vanitas threatens to kill Terra and Aqua if he does refuse . They battle within the Keyblade Graveyard , where Vanitas merges with Ventus and obtains the χ @-@ blade . However , this fusion is incomplete , which allows Ventus to destroy Vanitas within his heart and Aqua to destroy the χ @-@ blade . As a result , Ventus loses his heart and his body is placed within Castle Oblivion by Aqua until he awakens . Ventus ' wandering heart is able to find its way back to the young Sora , who accepts Ventus ' heart into his body . In the game 's secret ending , he is seen in the Land of Departure with Terra , and the two utter Sora 's name with newfound hope . 
 Ventus is mentioned in the secret ending of Kingdom Hearts Re : coded , when Mickey reveals he has learned where Ventus ' heart is , having searched for his whereabouts for the past ten years . In Kingdom Hearts 3D : Dream Drop Distance , Sora briefly takes the form of Ventus during a dream , and when his heart is wounded , Ventus ' armor appears to protect his body . In the ending of the game , Ventus is shown in Castle Oblivion , still in his catatonic state , his face drawn into a smile . 
 = = Creation and development = = 
 When first designing Ventus , Tetsuya Nomura already decided the character should look like Sora or Roxas , and decided to choose the latter when thinking that Vanitas being revealed to have Sora 's appearance would give a big impact to the gamers . Nomura wanted Ventus ' personality to more closely resemble Sora 's , which led to his outgoing personality , yet at the same time he wanted him to become more serious as the game progressed to make them distinct . Ventus was first shown in the secret endings of Kingdom Hearts II and its rerelease Kingdom Hearts II : Final Mix . Ventus ' name first appeared as a code in a 2006 Tokyo Game Show promotional video of the games . While making Final <unk> ending , Nomura had only developed the backstory for Terra , Aqua and Ventus and not their appearances , but had to finish their design for the end of game cameo . Nomura did not reveal their identities , and only stated that the three character were from the chronological past of the Kingdom Hearts series . Following their release , Nomura stated that his nickname was Ven . Ventus was first mentioned by the character Lingering Sentiment in Final Mix as Ven , while his full name was still unrevealed . He also mentioned a connection between him and Xemnas but wanted to leave it up to people 's imaginations as he still could not reveal his identity . 
 Nomura commented that , despite how similar they are , Roxas and Ventus are not the same character . Additionally , he stated that by playing Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep , players will be able to distinguish Roxas from Ventus and that the game explores his true personality . In another interview , Nomura implied both characters are related , specifically to Sora , but he wanted fans to imagine reasons for such connection . The guidebook Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Ultimania clarified the connection , stating that Roxas and Ventus look alike because Ventus ' heart entered Sora 's body and Roxas ' birth allowed Ventus ' heart to reside in Roxas . In early versions of development , Nomura planned to have Ventus ' broken heart be healed by the heart of Sora before he was born , but after negative feedback from overseas coworkers it was abandoned . Like Roxas , Ventus has been voiced Kōki Uchiyama in Japanese and Jesse McCartney in English . 
 Ventus ' name means " wind " in Latin ; both it and his Keyblade are called Wayward Wind , known in Japan as Fresh Breeze ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) , and have a " sky " theme similar to that of Sora 's . During development of Birth by Sleep , the Osaka team in charge of developing the game suggested that Ventus should be related with Vanitas , something which Nomura liked as he wanted to add more connections within the story , so Vanitas ' name was made to sound similar to Ventus ' name . Nomura had trouble designing the armor for Ventus , Terra and Aqua since the gameplay mechanism for activating their armor had not been fleshed out . Therefore , an " X " was added to their clothes as a way to activate the armors as well as due to the fact it was one of the game 's keywords . Ever since development of Birth by Sleep started , the staff already decided that Ventus ' , Aqua 's and Terra 's stories would be told in separate scenarios , with Ventus ' story being the second one written . They also wanted emphasize the lack of coincidences in the series , leading to the interaction between the three scenarios . In gameplay perspective , Ventus was designed to be the easiest character to play with in Birth by Sleep , although Nomura recommended to players that Ventus should be the second character to play with in order to understand the story better . Additionally , the way Ventus handles his Keyblade backwards is meant to show the gameplay differences between his and Terra 's and Aqua 's scenarios . Nomura also remarked Ventus ' encounter with the characters Lea and Isa as an important event from the game , hoping both newcomers and older gamers will also find it important from Ventus ' perspective .

 Due to his resemblance with Roxas , video game publications initially thought that Roxas would be one of the protagonists from Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep when seeing one of Ventus ' images . However , when it was revealed that the two were different , publications continued to discuss how similar they were and if there was a connection between them . GamesRadar particularly thought that there would be an eventual connection between the two of them and Sora . Amanda L. <unk> from Cheat Code Central also commented on speculations regarding the similarities between both of them , but mentioned that due to the existence of Nobodies in series , it is hard to find them as coincidences . When Jesse McCartney confirmed he was working on the English localization of Birth by Sleep , sites thought that he would voice Ventus , as he also voiced Roxas in previous titles . The character 's story and actions shown in the demonstrations were praised for being the " most original take on Kingdom Hearts " and yet " frustratingly traditional " . Upon Ventus ' introduction in Birth by Sleep , X @-@ Play found the character to be very similar to Sora 's due to his friendly attitude . Kevin VanOrd from the same site gave praise to Ventus ' character for his " well @-@ meaning " and yet not " annoying " personality . The site also said that the time players spend playing with Ventus would be " rewarding " and commented on the English voice acting . PlayStation LifeStyle 's Thomas Williams found the trio of Ventus , Terra and Aqua as welcome additions to the franchise , finding their stories enjoyable even though the three travel to the same worlds . On the other hand , PALGN found the three characters unappealing , labelling Ventus as " just a Roxas clone , but without his personality . " In contrast to 1UP 's comments towards Ventus ' actions in Cinderella 's world , VanOrd commented that such interactions to be " more bothersome than boisterous . " Writing for GamesRadar , Chris <unk> called Ventus a " Roxas @-@ clone " , and did not understand why he was briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II .

 Lees Ferry ( also known as Lee 's Ferry , Lee Ferry , Little Colorado Station and Saints Ferry ) is a site on the Colorado River in Coconino County , Arizona in the United States , about 7 @.@ 5 miles ( 12 @.@ 1 km ) southwest of Page and 9 miles ( 14 km ) south of the Utah – Arizona border . 
 Due to its unique geography – the only place in hundreds of miles from which one can easily access the Colorado River from both sides – it historically served as an important river crossing and starting in the mid @-@ 19th century was the site of a ferry operated by John Doyle Lee , for whom it is named . Boat service at Lees Ferry continued for over 60 years before being superseded by a bridge in the early 20th century , which allowed for much more efficient automobile travel . 
 Lees Ferry served as a military outpost for 19th @-@ century settlements in Utah , a center of limited gold seeking and since the 1920s the principal point at which river flow is measured to determine water allocations in the 246 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 640 @,@ 000 km2 ) Colorado River basin . Lees Ferry demarcates the boundary between the Upper and Lower Basins of the Colorado River ; the states which make up each basin are legally allocated one @-@ half of the river 's natural flow . Glen Canyon Dam impounds the Colorado a short distance upstream and completely regulates the river flow past Lees Ferry . Lees Ferry has long been a focal point of American Southwest water disputes , and has been called " both the physical and spiritual heart of water history in the arid West " . Today Lees Ferry is a well @-@ known fishing and boat launching point , including for whitewater rafting trips through the Grand Canyon . 
 = = Geography and geology = = 
 Lees Ferry is located in northern Arizona , at the point where the Paria River joins the Colorado from the north . Lying in an open valley directly downstream from Glen Canyon and shortly above Marble Canyon ( the uppermost section of the Grand Canyon ) , it is the only place in more than 260 miles ( 420 km ) where the Colorado is not hemmed in by sheer canyon walls . This made it an important crossing point before the construction of Navajo and Glen Canyon Bridges in the 20th century . Here , the Colorado River is also much smoother and calmer than the stretches that lie above and below . In the past , another crossing was the former Glen Canyon reach , but it is now flooded under Lake Powell , formed by Glen Canyon Dam 16 miles ( 26 km ) upstream . Lees Ferry is designated within the southwesternmost extreme of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and is considered the northernmost end of Grand Canyon National Park . It lies 689 miles ( 1 @,@ 109 km ) upstream of the Colorado 's mouth at the Gulf of California , at the approximate halfway mark of the river 's length . 
 The surrounding valley formed because of a swell in the underlying rock of the Colorado Plateau that caused the regional elevation to intersect the Chinle and Moenkopi Formations , deposited in the Triassic about 208 – 245 million years ago . This area contains sandstone , siltstone , shale and limestone formed by the sediments on ancient seabeds and later alluvial deposits made by the Colorado and Paria Rivers . Because these are more easily eroded than the rock layers that lie above and below them , the Colorado Plateau gradually slopes down to river level at Lees Ferry through a series of flat <unk> . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early inhabitants and explorers = = = 
 In pre @-@ Columbian times , the Lees Ferry area was inhabited first by Paleo @-@ Indians , who populated the region beginning about 11 @,@ 500 years ago , followed by the Archaic culture , which appeared on the Colorado Plateau about 8 @,@ 000 years ago . The Anasazi , Paiute and Navajo peoples , who left more evidence of habitation in the valley , arrived only in the last 1 @,@ 000 years or so . Evidence , including the discovery of two ruins nearby on the Paria River , suggests that the Anasazi utilized the area sometime in the 12th century A.D. Nonetheless , indigenous peoples generally did not make extensive use of the Lees Ferry area and other canyon stretches of the Colorado River , preferring the open plains above for hunting . However , Lees Ferry did later become a disputed territory between the Navajos and Paiutes , who recognized it as a valuable livestock watering point . 
 The first Europeans who happened upon Lees Ferry were members of the 18th @-@ century Dominguez @-@ Escalante Expedition , an attempt to find an overland route through the Southwest between Spanish settlements in present @-@ day New Mexico and California , and in the process , to convert as many Southwestern Native Americans as possible to Christianity . In late 1776 , the party ran out of supplies in what is now southern Utah and having decided to turn back towards Santa Fe , had to find a way to cross the Colorado River . Their Native American guides told them of two regional fords of the river , one at the site of Lees Ferry and the other at Glen Canyon . When the explorers arrived at Lees Ferry in October , they found the river too wide and deep and had no choice but to head for the second ford more than 40 miles ( 64 km ) upstream . Almost two weeks later they successfully crossed the river , and made it back to Santa Fe on January 2 , 1777 . This point , now submerged under Lake Powell , is named Crossing of the Fathers after Francisco Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante , the two Franciscan priests who headed the expedition . 
 During the 19th century , Lees Ferry served as a gateway for the expansion of white settlement from Utah south into Arizona . Most of the settlers were Mormons , who had been long established in the Utah Valley near present @-@ day Salt Lake City , and were looking for additional land . Although the river at Lee 's Ferry is too deep to ford for most of the year , its relatively calm current presented an attractive site for crossing by boat . Jacob Hamblin successfully crossed the river here in 1864 , and during the next few years the Mormon presence swelled to the scale of a small military outpost ( Fort Meeks ) in order to defend against Navajo raids . However , these works eventually fell into disrepair as a result of not being able to sustain themselves in the valley . 
 = = = John D. Lee and the ferry ( 1870 – 1876 ) = = = 
 John D. Lee , for whom Lees Ferry is now named , came to the crossing in 1870 with the goal of setting up a permanent ferry service for Mormon settlers heading south to Arizona . In 1857 , Lee had taken part in the Mountain Meadows massacre , in which a group of Mormons and Native Americans attacked a passing non @-@ Mormon wagon train from Arkansas , killing about 120 people . The ill @-@ conceived attack was the result of several factors including hysteria surrounding the 1857 " Utah War " and animosity toward Arkansans after the murder of Mormon apostle Parley P. Pratt near Van Buren , Arkansas . Years after the massacre , Lee moved to the remote Colorado River crossing to take refuge from the law . 
 Lee arrived in September with two of his wives and his children , and created a small settlement named Lonely Dell . The ferry was formally established in January 1873 , with the launching of the Colorado , the first of many boats that would ply the treacherous and fluctuating river at this point . The location of the ferry upstream from the Paria River confluence required passengers to traverse a dangerous incline nicknamed " Lee 's Backbone " on their ascent up the south wall of the valley . Four years later , Lee was finally arrested by the U.S. government and tried for his role in the massacre . Found guilty , he was executed by firing squad at Mountain Meadows on March 28 , 1877 . He was the only participant in the massacre to be tried and executed out of the over fifty men who had participated . 
 = = = 1877 – 1929 = = = 
 After Lee 's death , his wife Emma continued to operate the ferry for two years , in 1878 establishing an alternative ferry route below the confluence of the Paria River that allowed travelers to avoid the infamous Lee 's Backbone segment . However , this route could not be used in the summer months due to dangerous high water levels from snowmelt . In 1879 , the LDS Church bought the ferry and transferred its operation to Warren Marshall Johnson and his family . In 1896 the ferry was transferred to Jim <unk> , who installed a cable across the Colorado River to reduce the risk of boats washing downstream during high water . 
 During this time , Lees Ferry and the surrounding area attracted people because of a series of gold strikes in southern Utah , beginning with Cass Hite , a prospector who discovered gold in Glen Canyon in 1883 . Gold seekers came to the area as early as 1889 , when two Mormon prospectors by the names of Holladay and Huntington began to explore the surrounds of Lees Ferry . The most extravagant investment was a full @-@ scale mining operation led by Charles H. Spencer , head of the American Placer Company , who came to Lees Ferry in 1910 planning to extract gold from the Chinle Formation . Spencer brought in tons of equipment including a 92 @-@ foot ( 28 m ) steamboat , the Charles H. Spencer , reputedly the largest vessel ever to float the Colorado River upstream of the Grand Canyon . The operation was a dismal failure , and Spencer left , broke , in 1912 . The steamboat sank in 1921 and now lies in pieces along the Colorado from Glen Canyon to below Lees Ferry . 
 The ferry continued to run until 1928 . In 1929 the first Navajo Bridge was completed at a location 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) downstream and allowed for far more efficient road travel between Utah and Arizona . Somewhat ironically , the ferry was instrumental in transporting materials for the bridge until June 1928 , when the ferryboat capsized , drowning three men and a Ford Model T. The ferry was never replaced , and the bridge was completed seven months later , relegating Lees Ferry from a crowded transportation hub to a quiet backwater . 
 = = Water rights = = 
 Since August 1921 , Lees Ferry has been the site of a stream gage operated by the U.S. Geological Survey and has since accumulated one of the most extensive streamflow records ever made in the United States . The river flow here is the principal factor in allocating water to the seven U.S. and two Mexican states in the Colorado River basin . The Colorado River Compact of 1922 apportioned an equal portion of the river 's flow to the Upper Basin ( the U.S. states of Colorado , New Mexico , Utah , Wyoming and northern Arizona ) and the Lower Basin ( Arizona , California and Nevada ) , with the individual " basins " divided by an imaginary line at Lees Ferry . 
 Total allocations , including a later 1944 treaty with Mexico guaranteeing that country most of the remaining water in the river , ran up to 16 @.@ 5 million acre feet ( 20 @.@ 3 km3 ) , which was believed to be the natural flow of the Colorado River based on early observations at Lees Ferry and other <unk> along the river . To fully utilize these allocations and prevent water from " wasting " to the ocean , the U.S. federal government constructed a number of large storage dams on the Colorado River system . The canyon country around Lees Ferry was considered for the site of the first dam , but was abandoned in favor of a site lower on the Colorado , where Hoover Dam was completed in 1936 . In the 1960s , the area was again investigated as part of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation 's Colorado River Storage Project , and that assessment culminated in the construction of Glen Canyon Dam in 1966 . The filling of the resulting Lake Powell of 24 @.@ 3 million acre feet ( 30 @.@ 0 km3 ) inundated the Crossing of the Fathers , Charles Spencer 's old mining operation , and other historic landmarks of the area . Flood control at Glen Canyon also smoothed out the seasonal flux of the Colorado River that so beleaguered the ferry operations at Lees Ferry in the past . 
 Lees Ferry has long been a focal point of American Southwest water disputes , and has been called " both the physical and spiritual heart of water history in the arid West " . From the 1940s onward , Colorado River flows were found to average significantly less than what was allocated under the two treaties , and 21st century studies have postulated that the actual sustainable flow past Lees Ferry is between 13 @.@ 5 and 14 @.@ 7 million acre feet ( 16 @.@ 7 – 18 @.@ 1 km3 ) , creating water supply issues for the river basin .

 Lees Ferry is considered the official beginning of Grand Canyon National Park on the Colorado River and is used as a fishing area and river rafting launch site . The main access is by Lees Ferry Road , which splits off from U.S. Route 89 at the hamlet of Marble Canyon , Arizona , on the west side of the Navajo Bridges . The Lonely Dell Ranch Historic District , listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and expanded to include Lees Ferry in 1997 , features several buildings built during and after John D. Lee 's brief tenure at the site along with some remnants of the Charles H. Spencer . The area is managed by the National Park Service within the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area as a historical site . 
 Lees Ferry is the principal starting point for whitewater rafting trips through the Grand Canyon , which are said to offer " a trip backwards through time " as the river cuts through progressively older strata . The majority of trips are run by commercial rafting enterprises using both paddle and motorized inflatable rafts to carry large parties of tourists ( up to 24 passengers per raft ) on the river with most trips lasting from one week to ten days . Some trips travel all the way to Lake Mead , 277 miles ( 446 km ) downstream , and can last several weeks . Permits for private trips are no longer backlogged on an extensive waiting list , but instead are now based on a lottery system . All but the most experienced rapid runners are discouraged from this potentially dangerous trip . 
 Trips upstream from the nearby Paria Riffle may be made without special permit ( other than a day use boating fee ) and users may travel 16 miles ( 26 km ) upstream on calm waters to the foot of Glen Canyon Dam . This reach of the Colorado River is also well known for its status as a Blue Ribbon fishery , thanks to releases of cold , clear water from Glen Canyon Dam that make conditions ideal for introduced rainbow trout . While the river here has been stocked with rainbows since 1964 , the implementation of a more stable flow regime at Glen Canyon Dam in 1991 has somewhat reduced the average size of fish caught there due to the increased survival rate of young fish and the resulting competition . 
 Lees Ferry is also the ending point for backpacking and <unk> trips down the Paria River , which features historic petroglyphs , slot canyons , waterfalls and natural bridges including Wrather Arch , the longest such formation in the U.S. outside of Utah . 
 Fishing is an especially important part of the local recreational use of Lees Ferry drawing thousands of anglers a year seeking large trout . In given year there are possible world record fish available in the Glen Canyon Dam area . Several local guides and shops service the water .

 Scenes from the movie Into the Wild ( based on the book by Jon Krakauer ) were shot on location in 2006 at the Lees Ferry National Park Service Station , which featured actors Emile Hirsch as Christopher McCandless and Steven Wiig as the Lees Ferry Ranger , Steve Koehler . 
 = Battle of Baykand = 
 The Battle of Baykand was fought in 729 between the Turkic Turgesh khaganate and its Soghdian allies and the Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate at Baykand , a town near Bukhara in Transoxiana ( in modern Uzbekistan ) . The Arab army , under the governor of Khurasan Ashras ibn Abdallah al @-@ Sulami , campaigned across the Oxus River to suppress a large @-@ scale rebellion of the subject Soghdian princes , that had broken out the previous year and received Turgesh support . As the Arab army advanced on Bukhara , it was encircled by the Turgesh and cut off from water . A series of engagements followed that almost ended in a disaster for the Arabs like the " Day of Thirst " five years earlier , but in the end , through the inspirational bravery of a few Arab leaders and the actions of the vanguard under al @-@ Harith ibn Surayj and Qatan ibn Qutayba , the Arabs broke through and reached Bukhara , which they laid siege to . 
 = = Background = = 
 The region of Transoxiana ( Arabic : Ma wara ' al @-@ nahr ) had been conquered by the Umayyad leader Qutayba ibn Muslim in the reign of al @-@ Walid I ( reigned 705 – 715 ) , following the Muslim conquests of Persia and Khurasan in the mid @-@ 7th century . The loyalties of Transoxiana 's native Iranian and Turkic populations and of the autonomous local rulers remained questionable , however : in 719 the Transoxianian princes sent a petition to the Chinese court and their Turgesh vassals for military aid against the Umayyad Caliphate 's governors . In response , from 720 on the Turgesh launched a series of attacks against the Muslims in Transoxiana , coupled with uprisings against the Caliphate among the local Sogdians . The Umayyad governors initially managed to suppress the unrest , although control over the Ferghana Valley was lost . In 724 governor Muslim ibn Sa 'id al @-@ Kilabi and his army suffered a heavy defeat ( the so @-@ called " Day of Thirst " ) at the hands of the Turgesh when he tried to subdue Ferghana . This defeat pushed the Arabs on the defensive , and even though no pitched battles took place , over the next few years the Arab position in Transoxiana collapsed swiftly . 
 = = Ashras al @-@ Sulami 's campaign = = 
 Faced with this crisis , the Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al @-@ Malik ( r . 723 – 743 ) took drastic measures : Khurasan was separated from the purview of the governor of Iraq and raised to a separate province , under the Jaziran general Ashras ibn Abdallah al @-@ Sulami . Like his predecessor , Asad ibn Abdallah al @-@ Qasri , Ashras tried to win over the loyalties of the local population and the native , non @-@ Arab converts to Islam ( mawali ) , by addressing some of their grievances on taxation . Soon , however , this policy was reversed — possibly due to pressure from the Caliph himself — and the often brutal measures the Arab tax @-@ gatherers employed to gather the taxes from the mawali and the local landed aristocracy ( dihqans ) led to a general revolt in Transoxiana . This was made all the more dangerous to the Arabs due to the rebels ' call for assistance to the Turgesh ruler , the khagan , who replied by leading his army in person against the Arabs . By the time the khagan entered the field in 728 , only Samarkand and the two fortresses of Kamarja and Dabusiyya on the Zarafshan River remained in Arab hands in all of Transoxiana . 
 In order to confront the Turgesh , Ashras assembled the forces of Khurasan , and led them to Amul on the Oxus River . A vanguard under Qatan , son of Qutayba ibn Muslim , was sent over the river and established a fortified camp , but with the arrival of the combined native Soghdian and Turgesh armies , the bulk of the Arab force was unable to cross for three months . During this period Qatan 's force was beleaguered by the Turgesh , who at the same time crossed the Oxus in small raiding parties . Ashras gave command of his cavalry to <unk> <unk> , who managed to rout the raiders and drive them to Amul . There the Arabs defeated the Turgesh , although a decisive victory eluded them as Turgesh reinforcements crossed the river and allowed the raiders to escape to safety back over the Oxus . At length Ashras got his forces across , linked up with Qatan ibn Qutayba , and began to advance on Bukhara . The Arabs beat off attacks to reach the trading town of Baykand , some five farsakhs — roughly 30 kilometres ( 19 miles ) — south of Bukhara itself and outside the oasis that surrounded the latter . After the Arab army encamped at Baykand , the Turgesh and Soghdians cut off the water supply from the oasis . 
 Threatened with thirst , the Arab army left Baykand and headed for Bukhara , with Qatan in the vanguard . When the Turgesh and Soghdian forces attacked , the vanguard , some 6 @,@ 000 men , was cut off from the main body under Ashras , and Ashras and Qatan gave each other up for lost until they met again two days later . The king of Samarkand , Ghurak , who had unto this moment remained ostensibly loyal to the Arabs — although , ever careful to hedge his bets , he had sent his son Mukhtar to the khagan — now switched sides . Exhausted by thirst , the Arab vanguard was almost cut down by their enemies , losing 700 men . At this point , according to the account preserved by al @-@ Tabari , the Tamimi warrior al @-@ Harith ibn Surayj , who was later to lead a widespread revolt in Khurasan , urged the Arabs forward , crying that " being killed by the sword is nobler in ( this ) world and greater in reward with God than death by thirst " . Encouraged by his example , the Tamimi and Qaysi cavalry under al @-@ Harith and Qatan broke through the Turgesh lines and reached the water sources , narrowly staving off a second " Day of Thirst " and allowing Ashras to continue his advance towards Bukhara . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Following the series of battles around Baykand , the Turgesh retired north to Samarkand , where they assaulted the fortress of Kamarja , while Ashras with his troops besieged Bukhara and wintered in its oasis . Warfare did not die down , however , and the Arabs ' situation remained precarious : when , in early 730 , Ashras ' newly appointed successor Junayd ibn Abd al @-@ Rahman al @-@ Murri tried to reach the army , which was still encamped in the Bukhara oasis , he had to be escorted from Amul by 7 @,@ 000 cavalry who were attacked on the way by the Turgesh and almost destroyed . Although Bukhara was recovered by the Arabs at this time , either under Ashras or under Junayd , in the very next year the latter led the Khurasani army to disaster in the Battle of the Defile , an event which shattered the tenuous Arab control over what remained of their possessions in Transoxiana . The Arabs were not able to recover their position until the governorship of Nasr ibn Sayyar , who in 739 – 741 managed to re @-@ establish the Caliphate 's authority up to Samarkand . 
 = Western green mamba = 
 The western green mamba ( Dendroaspis viridis ) , also known as the West African green mamba or Hallowell 's green mamba , is a long , thin , and highly venomous snake of the mamba genus , Dendroaspis . This species was first described in 1844 by the American herpetologist Edward Hallowell . The western green mamba is a fairly large and predominantly arboreal species , capable of navigating through trees swiftly and gracefully . It will also descend to ground level to pursue prey such as rodents and other small mammals . 
 The western green mamba is a very alert , nervous , and extremely agile snake that lives mainly in the coastal tropical rainforest , thicket , and woodland regions of western Africa . Like all the other mambas , the western green mamba is a highly venomous elapid species . Its venom is a highly potent mixture of rapid @-@ acting presynaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins ( <unk> ) , cardiotoxins and fasciculins . Some consider this species to not be a particularly aggressive snake , but others have suggested that they are extremely nervous and are prone to attack aggressively when cornered . Conflict with humans is low compared to some other species found in the region . Bites to people by this species are quite uncommon . Their mortality rate , however , is high ; many of the recorded bites have been fatal . Rapid progression of severe , life @-@ threatening symptoms are hallmarks of mamba bites . Bites with envenomation can be rapidly fatal . Case reports of rapidly fatal outcomes , in as little as 30 minutes , have been recorded for this species . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Dendroaspis viridis was first described by the American herpetologist and physician Edward Hallowell in 1844 . The generic name , Dendroaspis , is derived from Ancient Greek – <unk> , which means " tree " , and aspis ( ασπίς ) or " asp " , which ' is understood to mean " shield " , but it also denotes " cobra " or simply " snake " . In old texts , aspis or asp was used to refer to Naja haje ( in reference to the hood , like a shield ) . Thus , " Dendroaspis " literally means tree snake , which refers to the arboreal nature of most of the species within the genus . Schlegel used the name Dendroaspis , which he described as meaning tree cobra . The specific name viridis is of Latin origin and means " green " . In addition to being called the western green mamba , this species is also commonly known as the West African green mamba or Hallowell 's green mamba . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The western green mamba is classified under the genus Dendroaspis of the family Elapidae . The genus was described by the German ornithologist and herpetologist Hermann Schlegel in 1848 . Slowinski et al ( 1997 ) pointed out that the relationships of the African genus Dendroaspis are problematical . However , evidence suggests that Dendroaspis , Ophiophagus , Bungarus , and <unk> form a solid non @-@ coral snake Afro @-@ Asiatic clade . 
 = = Description = = 
 The western green mamba is a long and very slender bodied snake with a long tapering tail . The average length of an adult snake of this species is between 1 @.@ 4 metres ( 4 @.@ 6 ft ) and 2 @.@ 1 metres ( 6 @.@ 9 ft ) . Some specimens of this species can grow to maximum lengths of 2 @.@ 4 metres ( 7 @.@ 9 ft ) . The head is narrow and elongate , with a distinct canthus and slightly distinct from the neck . On rare occasions the neck may be flattened when the snake is aroused , but there is no hood . Eyes are medium in size with round pupils and a yellow brown iris . 
 = = = Scalation = = = 
 Dorsal surface body colour is vivid yellowish green to green with anterior margins of the scales yellow . In many specimens the posterior body and tail are yellow . In some specimens , dorsal body scales are distinctly bordered with black forming chevron shaped markings . The black interstitial skin is clearly visible especially highlighting individual head scales and scales on the tail . Head dorsum is similar to dorsal surface anterior body colour or slightly darker green . Laterally , the head scales , particularly the labials , are distinctly black edged and colouration is usually paler than dorsum or slightly yellowish tinted . When viewed from above the black edging of scales and black interstitial skin result in a plaited appearance . Head venter , throat , ventral and subcaudal surface colour is pale yellowish to yellowish green .

 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The western green mamba is native to West Africa . Different sources give slightly different ranges but generally agree that it occurs from Gambia and southern Senegal to Benin , including the intervening countries ( from west to east ) Guinea @-@ Bissau , Guinea , Sierra Leone , Liberia , Cote d 'Ivoire ( Ivory Coast ) , Ghana , and Togo . In Togo it has a known northern limit to its distribution in <unk> , but it might occur in forests of the more northerly Kara region Records from Nigeria might be unreliable , and its presence in the Central African Republic is similarly unclear . Some sources mention it also from the very southern tip of Mali along the border with Côte d 'Ivoire , as well as from western Cameroon and Gabon . 
 Western green mambas live mainly in the coastal tropical rainforest , thicket , and woodland regions of western Africa . The majority of records of the western green mamba are from within the continuous forest , but the Gambia and Guinea @-@ Bissau records are from isolated forests . The species persists in areas where the tree cover has been removed , providing that sufficient hedges and thicket remain . Found in some suitably vegetated suburbs and towns and parklands therein . It is largely confined to areas where rainfall exceeds 1 @,@ 500 millimetres ( 150 cm ) . In Togo , however , its range extends into the drier open forests of the north , the Guinean savannas of the west , and the littoral zone . 
 = = = Conservation status = = = 
 This species is classified as Least Concern ( LC ) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species ( <unk> , 2011 ) . The conservation status of this species was last assessed in July 2012 and published in 2013 , and it was classed as such due to a wide distribution , fairly generalist habits , stable population and the lack of major threats . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 This species is mostly diurnal , but may be active at night as well . It is an arboreal snake , but it does commonly go to the ground . In fact , it is equally at home hunting and feeding on prey on the ground or in trees . When it wants to sleep it seeks out tree branches that offer dense cover . It is a very quick , extremely agile , alert , and nervous snake . When confronted it will quickly attempt to escape ( usually up a tree if possible ) and avoid any sort of confrontation . If cornered , the western green mamba is highly dangerous and will show a fearsome display of aggression , loudly hissing and striking repeatedly . 
 = = = Diet and predators = = = 
 The western green mamba 's natural prey consists mainly of birds and small mammals , including rodents such as mice , rats , and squirrels . Other mammals include bats , tree pangolins , and shrews . They also feed on lizards , frogs , and bird eggs . This snake pursues its prey , striking rapidly and often until the prey succumbs to the venom . 
 The western green mamba , as a large and highly venomous snake , has very few natural predators , but humans and birds of prey are this snake 's main threats . 
 = = Venom = = 
 The western green mamba 's venom is similar to those of other members of the mamba genus ( Dendroaspis ) , but differs from others in toxicity and the composition of the toxins . The venom consists mainly of both pre @-@ synaptic and post @-@ synaptic neurotoxins , cardiotoxins , and fasciculins . The toxicity of the venom can vary tremendously depending on various factors including diet , geographical location , age @-@ dependent change , and other factors . The SC and IV LD50 for this species is 0 @.@ 79 mg / kg and 0 @.@ 71 mg / kg , respectively ( Christensen and Anderson ( 1967 ) ) . One study determined the LD50 of the venom administered to mice via the intraperitoneal ( IP ) route was 0 @.@ 33 mg / kg . In another test using mice that were administered the western green mamba 's venom via the intraperitoneal ( IP ) route the LD50 was 0 @.@ 045 mg / kg . Another experimental IV LD50 toxicity of 0 @.@ 5 mg / kg has been reported , with an average wet venom yield of 100 mg . Like other mamba species , western green mamba venom is among the most rapid @-@ acting venom of snakes . 
 Human fatalities as a result of bites from this species are rare due to the fact that this species does not often cross paths with humans , but bites have occurred and the majority of the recorded bites have been fatal . The three species of green mambas , including the western green mamba , have venom toxicities that are similar to and comparable to many species of cobras , but green mamba bites often present with more severe and life @-@ threatening symptoms in a shorter period of time . Mortality rates are also higher among green mamba bite victims than with cobra bite victims . Although bites by Dendroaspis viridis are not well documented and the rate of bites , envenoming and fatality is not well known , it appears that bites attributed to this species produce more severe envenomation than bites caused by Dendroaspis angusticeps ( eastern green mamba ) , but far less severe than bites caused by Dendroaspis polylepis ( black mamba ) . When bitten , symptoms rapidly begin to manifest , usually within the first 15 minutes or less . The extraordinary speed with which the venom spreads through tissue and produces rapid manifestations of life @-@ threatening symptoms is unique to mambas . Common symptoms of a bite from a western green mamba include local pain and swelling , although uncommon , local necrosis can be moderate , ataxia , headache , drowsiness , difficulty breathing , vertigo , hypotension ( low blood pressure ) , diarrhea , dizziness , and paralysis . Left untreated , new and more severe symptoms rapidly progress . All symptoms worsen and the victim eventually dies due to suffocation resulting from paralysis of the respiratory muscles . Bites with envenomation can be rapidly fatal . Case reports of rapidly fatal outcomes , in as little as 30 minutes , have been recorded for this species . 
 = 2015 Clásica de San Sebastián = 
 The 2015 Clásica de San Sebastián was a one @-@ day cycling classic that took place in the Basque Country in Spain on 1 August 2015 . It was the 35th edition of the Clásica de San Sebastián and was the nineteenth race of the 2015 UCI World Tour . The defending champion was Alejandro Valverde ( Movistar Team ) , who won a solo victory in the 2014 race . 
 The race took place in and around the city of San Sebastián and was 219 kilometres ( 136 mi ) in length . The principal difficulty in the race was the sequence of climbs in the final part of the course . Adam Yates ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) attacked on the final climb , the <unk> <unk> . Greg Van Avermaet ( BMC Racing Team ) was leading the race at the time , but he was hit by a race motorbike , forcing him out of the race . Yates went on to win a solo victory , 15 seconds ahead of the chasing group , becoming the first British rider to win the race . Valverde came third behind Philippe Gilbert ( BMC ) . 
 = = Route = = 
 The race began in San Sebastián with a 3 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 3 mi ) neutral zone and left the city to the west , along the coast of the Bay of Biscay . After 22 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 14 @.@ 0 mi ) , in Zarautz , the course turned to the south for another 24 kilometres ( 15 mi ) to come to Azpeitia . Here the route turned to the east and began climbing towards the first categorised climb of the day . The road gradually climbed for over 13 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ) , but only the final 3 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 2 mi ) were categorised . This section of road , the Alto de <unk> , had an average gradient of 5 % and was a first @-@ category climb . The summit of the climb came after 59 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 37 @.@ 0 mi ) . 
 After the descent , there was a fairly flat section of the course . This took the riders northeast for approximately 60 kilometres ( 37 mi ) through <unk> , <unk> and Lezo before the first of two ascents of the Alto de Jaizkibel . This was also a first @-@ category climb ; it was 7 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 8 mi ) in length at an average gradient of 5 @.@ 8 % . The summit of the climb came after 125 kilometres ( 78 mi ) , with 94 kilometres ( 58 mi ) to go to the finish . There was then a descent and a fairly flat 20 @-@ kilometre ( 12 mi ) section of road through <unk> . The next climb was the second @-@ category Alto Arkale . This was 2 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 7 mi ) at 6 @.@ 3 % ; the summit came with 71 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 44 @.@ 2 mi ) remaining . The descent took the riders through <unk> and then into a second loop through the climbs of the Alto de Jaizkibel and the Alto Arkale . At the second summit of the Alto Arkale , there were 30 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 19 @.@ 1 mi ) remaining to the finish line . 
 The next section of the course was 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) of fairly flat roads . During this section of the race , the riders returned to San Sebastián and crossed the finish line ; at this point there were still 16 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) remaining . The riders left the town again to face the final climb of the day , the second @-@ category <unk> <unk> . This was a 2 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) climb at 9 % ; at the summit there were 7 @.@ 1 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 4 mi ) of descent and then flat roads to the finish . The final climb was introduced in the 2014 edition and included gradients up to 20 % ; the lead group was formed on this ascent in the 2014 race , with Alejandro Valverde attacking on the descent and maintaining a gap to the finish line . 
 = = Teams = = 
 As the Clásica de San Sebastián is a UCI World Tour event , all seventeen UCI WorldTeams were invited automatically and obliged to send a squad . Two UCI Professional Continental teams , Caja Rural – Seguros RGA and Cofidis , were given wildcard places to form a nineteen @-@ team peloton . Seventeen teams started the race with eight riders ; Team Sky and LottoNL – Jumbo started the race with seven men . There were therefore 150 riders in the peloton at the start of the race . 
 = = Pre @-@ race favourites = = 
 The Clásica de San Sebastián is the most important one @-@ day race in Spain . It comes a week after the conclusion of the Tour de France . Some riders , including Chris Froome ( Team Sky ) , the winner of the Tour , chose not to participate in the race . Riders also arrived from the Tour in a variety of conditions : some were in good form , while others were exhausted . Another of the principal riders from the Tour de France , Alberto Contador ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , originally planned to participate but was forced to withdraw because of a fever . 
 The principal favourite for the race was Alejandro Valverde ( Movistar Team ) , who was third in the Tour de France . Valverde was the defending champion in the Clásica de San Sebastián , having won the 2014 edition with an attack on the final descent ; he had also won the 2008 race from a small group sprint . As well as his podium place at the Tour , Valverde had also won La Flèche Wallonne and the Liège – Bastogne – Liège in 2015 . The other principal favourite was Joaquim Rodríguez ( Team Katusha ) . Rodríguez won two stages during the Tour and was expected to be in fresh condition , as he did not attempt a high position in the general classification . 
 Several other riders were considered to have a strong chance of victory . These included Philippe Gilbert ( BMC Racing Team ) , the winner in 2011 , Mikel Landa ( Astana ) , who had been third in the Giro d 'Italia , and Julian Alaphilippe ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , who had finished second to Valverde in both La Flèche Wallonne and Liège – Bastogne – Liège . 
 = = Race report = = 
 A breakaway of eight riders formed in the early part of the race . These were Manuele Boaro ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , Valerio Agnoli ( Astana ) , Dennis Vanendert ( Lotto – Soudal ) , Nathan Haas ( Cannondale – Garmin ) , Maarten Wynants ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) , Thomas Degand ( IAM Cycling ) , Lluís Mas ( Caja Rural – Seguros RGA ) and Romain Hardy ( Cofidis ) . These riders stayed together for approximately 160 kilometres ( 99 mi ) ; the Movistar Team controlled the peloton and kept the breakaway 's lead to around three minutes . Boaro attacked the group on the second climb of the Alto de Jaizkibel and opened a gap on the other riders , but he was too far from the finish to make a solo attack last to the finish of the race . 
 On the final climb of the Alto de Jaizkibel , there were several attacks in the main peloton . These attacks came together on the penultimate climb of the day , the Alto Arkale , to form a sixteen @-@ rider lead group . This group included Warren Barguil ( Giant @-@ Alpecin ) , Dan Martin ( Cannondale @-@ Garmin ) , Philippe Gilbert and Greg Van Avermaet ( both BMC Racing Team ) , Alejandro Valverde ( Movistar Team ) , Joaquim Rodríguez ( Team Katusha ) and Adam Yates ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) . There was significant confusion on the final climb : the last riders from the early breakaway were being caught and the television coverage failed , so the teams were relying on race radio to follow the riders ' positions . 
 The first attacks on the final climb came from Barguil and Van Avermaet , followed by Yates , while Rodríguez and Valverde waited in the main group . Yates passed Barguil and was chasing Van Avermaet , who was in the lead of the race . Towards the top of the climb , however , Van Avermaet was hit from behind by one of the motorbikes providing television coverage of the race . He was knocked to the ground and the frame of the bike was broken ; Van Avermaet was unable to finish the race . Yates therefore led the race alone at the top of the final climb as the race descended into San Sebastián . Unlike in the 2014 race , when he had crashed out of the lead group on the final descent , Yates extended his lead to 15 seconds as the road flattened out and was able to keep this advantage to the end of the race . As he crossed the finish line , Yates was unaware that he had won the race , as he believed that the initial breakaway had not been caught . It took some time for the message to come through from his team that he had won . In the group behind , Gilbert sprinted to second place ahead of Valverde . 
 Yates 's victory was the first WorldTour victory of his career and the first ever victory by a British rider in the Clásica de San Sebastián . Van Avermaet and the BMC team , however , were unhappy with the crash that had eliminated him from the race and issued a statement from Jim <unk> , the team 's manager , saying that " Greg was robbed and the BMC Racing Team was robbed " and that the team would " explore every legal option " . Simon Yates – Adam 's brother and his teammate at Orica – GreenEDGE – described these comments as " quite disrespectful " ; Van Avermaet later clarified that he considered Yates 's victory well @-@ deserved . The race organisers later wrote to Van Avermaet apologising for the incident ; Van Avermaet was unable to read the letter , however , as it was written in Spanish .

 = Parity of zero = 
 Zero is an even number . In other words , its parity — the quality of an integer being even or odd — is even . The simplest way to prove that zero is even is to check that it fits the definition of " even " : it is an integer multiple of 2 , specifically 0 × 2 . As a result , zero shares all the properties that characterize even numbers : 0 is divisible by 2 , 0 is neighbored on both sides by odd numbers , 0 is the sum of an integer ( 0 ) with itself , and a set of 0 objects can be split into two equal sets . 
 Zero also fits into the patterns formed by other even numbers . The parity rules of arithmetic , such as even − even 
 = even , require 0 to be even . Zero is the additive identity element of the group of even integers , and it is the starting case from which other even natural numbers are recursively defined . Applications of this recursion from graph theory to computational geometry rely on zero being even . Not only is 0 divisible by 2 , it is divisible by every power of 2 , which is relevant to the binary numeral system used by computers . In this sense , 0 is the " most even " number of all . 
 Among the general public , the parity of zero can be a source of confusion . In reaction time experiments , most people are slower to identify 0 as even than 2 , 4 , 6 , or 8 . Some students of mathematics — and some teachers — think that zero is odd , or both even and odd , or neither . Researchers in mathematics education propose that these misconceptions can become learning opportunities . Studying equalities like 0 × 2 = 
 0 can address students ' doubts about calling 0 a number and using it in arithmetic . Class discussions can lead students to appreciate the basic principles of mathematical reasoning , such as the importance of definitions . Evaluating the parity of this exceptional number is an early example of a pervasive theme in mathematics : the abstraction of a familiar concept to an unfamiliar setting . 
 = = Why zero is even = = 
 The standard definition of " even number " can be used to directly prove that zero is even . A number is called " even " if it is an integer multiple of 2 . As an example , the reason that 10 is even is that it equals 5 × 2 . In the same way , zero is an integer multiple of 2 , namely 0 × 2 , so zero is even . 
 It is also possible to explain why zero is even without referring to formal definitions . The following explanations make sense of the idea that zero is even in terms of fundamental number concepts . From this foundation , one can provide a rationale for the definition itself — and its applicability to zero . 
 = = = Basic explanations = = = 
 Zero is a number , and numbers are used for counting . Given a set of objects , one uses a number to describe how many objects are in the set . Zero is the count of no objects ; in more formal terms , it is the number of objects in the empty set . The concept of parity is used for making groups of two objects . If the objects in a set can be marked off into groups of two , with none left over , then the number of objects is even . If an object is left over , then the number of objects is odd . The empty set contains zero groups of two , and no object is left over from this grouping , so zero is even . 
 These ideas can be illustrated by drawing objects in pairs . It is difficult to depict zero groups of two , or to emphasize the nonexistence of a leftover object , so it helps to draw other groupings and to compare them with zero . For example , in the group of five objects , there are two pairs . More importantly , there is a leftover object , so 5 is odd . In the group of four objects , there is no leftover object , so 4 is even . In the group of just one object , there are no pairs , and there is a leftover object , so 1 is odd . In the group of zero objects , there is no leftover object , so 0 is even . 
 There is another concrete definition of evenness : if the objects in a set can be placed into two groups of equal size , then the number of objects is even . This definition is equivalent to the first one . Again , zero is even because the empty set can be divided into two groups of zero items each . 
 Numbers can also be visualized as points on a number line . When even and odd numbers are distinguished from each other , their pattern becomes obvious , especially if negative numbers are included : 
 The even and odd numbers alternate . Starting at any even number , counting up or down by twos reaches the other even numbers , and there is no reason to skip over zero . 
 With the introduction of multiplication , parity can be approached in a more formal way using arithmetic expressions . Every integer is either of the form ( 2 × <unk> ) + 0 or ( 2 × <unk> ) + 1 ; the former numbers are even and the latter are odd . For example , 1 is odd because 1 
 = ( 2 × 0 ) + 1 , and 0 is even because 0 = 
 ( 2 × 0 ) + 0 . Making a table of these facts then reinforces the number line picture above . 
 = = = Defining parity = = = 
 The precise definition of a mathematical term , such as " even " meaning " integer multiple of two " , is ultimately a convention . Unlike " even " , some mathematical terms are purposefully constructed to exclude trivial or degenerate cases . Prime numbers are a famous example . Before the 20th century , definitions of <unk> were inconsistent , and significant mathematicians such as Goldbach , Lambert , Legendre , Cayley , and Kronecker wrote that 1 was prime . The modern definition of " prime number " is " positive integer with exactly 2 factors " , so 1 is not prime . This definition can be rationalized by observing that it more naturally suits mathematical theorems that concern the primes . For example , the fundamental theorem of arithmetic is easier to state when 1 is not considered prime . 
 It would be possible to similarly redefine the term " even " in a way that no longer includes zero . However , in this case , the new definition would make it more difficult to state theorems concerning the even numbers . Already the effect can be seen in the algebraic rules governing even and odd numbers . The most relevant rules concern addition , subtraction , and multiplication : 
 even ± even 
 = even 
 odd ± odd = 
 even 
 even × integer 
 = even 
 Inserting appropriate values into the left sides of these rules , one can produce 0 on the right sides : 
 2 − 2 = 
 0 
 − 3 + 3 
 = 0 
 4 × 0 = 
 0 
 The above rules would therefore be incorrect if zero were not even . At best they would have to be modified . For example , one test study guide asserts that even numbers are characterized as integer multiples of two , but zero is " neither even nor odd " . Accordingly , the guide 's rules for even and odd numbers contain exceptions : 
 even ± even 
 = even ( or zero ) 
 odd ± odd = 
 even ( or zero ) 
 even × nonzero integer = even 
 Making an exception for zero in the definition of evenness forces one to make such exceptions in the rules for even numbers . From another perspective , taking the rules obeyed by positive even numbers and requiring that they continue to hold for integers forces the usual definition and the evenness of zero . 
 = = Mathematical contexts = = 
 Countless results in number theory invoke the fundamental theorem of arithmetic and the algebraic properties of even numbers , so the above choices have far @-@ reaching consequences . For example , the fact that positive numbers have unique factorizations means that one can determine whether a number has an even or odd number of distinct prime factors . Since 1 is not prime , nor does it have prime factors , it is a product of 0 distinct primes ; since 0 is an even number , 1 has an even number of distinct prime factors . This implies that the Möbius function takes the value μ ( 1 ) = 1 , which is necessary for it to be a multiplicative function and for the Möbius inversion formula to work . 
 = = = Not being odd = = = 
 A number n is odd if there is an integer k such that n 
 = 2k + 1 . One way to prove that zero is not odd is by contradiction : if 0 = 
 2k + 1 then k = − 1 / 2 , which is not an integer . Since zero is not odd , if an unknown number is proven to be odd , then it cannot be zero . This apparently trivial observation can provide a convenient and revealing proof explaining why a number is nonzero . 
 A classic result of graph theory states that a graph of odd order ( having an odd number of vertices ) always has at least one vertex of even degree . ( The statement itself requires zero to be even : the empty graph has an even order , and an isolated vertex has an even degree . ) In order to prove the statement , it is actually easier to prove a stronger result : any odd @-@ order graph has an odd number of even degree vertices . The appearance of this odd number is explained by a still more general result , known as the handshaking lemma : any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree . Finally , the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula . 
 <unk> 's lemma is a more advanced application of the same strategy . The lemma states that a certain kind of coloring on a triangulation of a simplex has a <unk> that contains every color . Rather than directly construct such a <unk> , it is more convenient to prove that there exists an odd number of such <unk> through an induction argument . A stronger statement of the lemma then explains why this number is odd : it naturally breaks down as ( n + 1 ) + n when one considers the two possible orientations of a simplex . 
 = = = Even @-@ odd alternation = = = 
 The fact that zero is even , together with the fact that even and odd numbers alternate , is enough to determine the parity of every other natural number . This idea can be formalized into a recursive definition of the set of even natural numbers : 
 0 is even . 
 ( n + 1 ) is even if and only if n is not even . 
 This definition has the conceptual advantage of relying only on the minimal foundations of the natural numbers : the existence of 0 and of successors . As such , it is useful for computer logic systems such as LF and the Isabelle theorem prover . With this definition , the evenness of zero is not a theorem but an axiom . Indeed , " zero is an even number " may be interpreted as one of the Peano axioms , of which the even natural numbers are a model . A similar construction extends the definition of parity to transfinite ordinal numbers : every limit ordinal is even , including zero , and successors of even ordinals are odd . 
 The classic point in polygon test from computational geometry applies the above ideas . To determine if a point lies within a polygon , one casts a ray from infinity to the point and counts the number of times the ray crosses the edge of polygon . The crossing number is even if and only if the point is outside the polygon . This algorithm works because if the ray never crosses the polygon , then its crossing number is zero , which is even , and the point is outside . Every time the ray does cross the polygon , the crossing number alternates between even and odd , and the point at its tip alternates between outside and inside . 
 In graph theory , a bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices are split into two colors , such that neighboring vertices have different colors . If a connected graph has no odd cycles , then a bipartition can be constructed by choosing a base vertex v and coloring every vertex black or white , depending on whether its distance from v is even or odd . Since the distance between v and itself is 0 , and 0 is even , the base vertex is colored differently from its neighbors , which lie at a distance of 1 . 
 = = = Algebraic patterns = = = 
 In abstract algebra , the even integers form various algebraic structures that require the inclusion of zero . The fact that the additive identity ( zero ) is even , together with the evenness of sums and additive inverses of even numbers and the associativity of addition , means that the even integers form a group . Moreover , the group of even integers under addition is a subgroup of the group of all integers ; this is an elementary example of the subgroup concept . The earlier observation that the rule " even − even 
 = even " forces 0 to be even is part of a general pattern : any nonempty subset of an additive group that is closed under subtraction must be a subgroup , and in particular , must contain the identity . 
 Since the even integers form a subgroup of the integers , they partition the integers into cosets . These cosets may be described as the equivalence classes of the following equivalence relation : x ~ y if ( x − y ) is even . Here , the evenness of zero is directly manifested as the reflexivity of the binary relation ~ . There are only two cosets of this subgroup — the even and odd numbers — so it has index 2 . 
 Analogously , the alternating group is a subgroup of index 2 in the symmetric group on n letters . The elements of the alternating group , called even permutations , are the products of even numbers of transpositions . The identity map , an empty product of no transpositions , is an even permutation since zero is even ; it is the identity element of the group . 
 The rule " even × integer = 
 even " means that the even numbers form an ideal in the ring of integers , and the above equivalence relation can be described as equivalence modulo this ideal . In particular , even integers are exactly those integers k where k ≡ 0 ( mod 2 ) . This formulation is useful for investigating integer zeroes of polynomials . 
 = = = 2 @-@ adic order = = = 
 There is a sense in which some multiples of 2 are " more even " than others . <unk> of 4 are called doubly even , since they can be divided by 2 twice . Not only is zero divisible by 4 , zero has the unique property of being divisible by every power of 2 , so it surpasses all other numbers in " evenness " . 
 One consequence of this fact appears in the bit @-@ reversed ordering of integer data types used by some computer algorithms , such as the Cooley – Tukey fast Fourier transform . This ordering has the property that the farther to the left the first 1 occurs in a number 's binary expansion , or the more times it is divisible by 2 , the sooner it appears . Zero 's bit reversal is still zero ; it can be divided by 2 any number of times , and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s , so it always comes first . 
 Although 0 is divisible by 2 more times than any other number , it is not straightforward to quantify exactly how many times that is . For any nonzero integer n , one may define the 2 @-@ adic order of n to be the number of times n is divisible by 2 . This description does not work for 0 ; no matter how many times it is divided by 2 , it can always be divided by 2 again . Rather , the usual convention is to set the 2 @-@ order of 0 to be infinity as a special case . This convention is not peculiar to the 2 @-@ order ; it is one of the axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra . 
 The powers of two — 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , ... — form a simple sequence of numbers of increasing 2 @-@ order . In the 2 @-@ adic numbers , such sequences actually converge to zero . 
 = = Education = = 
 The subject of the parity of zero is often treated within the first two or three years of primary education , as the concept of even and odd numbers is introduced and developed . 
 = = = Students ' knowledge = = = 
 The chart on the right depicts children 's beliefs about the parity of zero , as they progress from Year 1 to Year 6 of the English education system . The data are from Len Frobisher , who conducted a pair of surveys of English schoolchildren . Frobisher was interested in how knowledge of single @-@ digit parity translates to knowledge of multiple @-@ digit parity , and zero figures prominently in the results . 
 In a preliminary survey of nearly 400 seven @-@ year @-@ olds , 45 % chose even over odd when asked the parity of zero . A follow @-@ up investigation offered more choices : neither , both , and don 't know . This time the number of children in the same age range identifying zero as even dropped to 32 % . Success in deciding that zero is even initially shoots up and then levels off at around 50 % in Years 3 to 6 . For comparison , the easiest task , identifying the parity of a single digit , levels off at about 85 % success . 
 In interviews , Frobisher elicited the students ' reasoning . One fifth @-@ year decided that 0 was even because it was found on the 2 times table . A couple of fourth @-@ years realized that zero can be split into equal parts . Another fourth @-@ year reasoned " 1 is odd and if I go down it 's even . " The interviews also revealed the misconceptions behind incorrect responses . A second @-@ year was " quite convinced " that zero was odd , on the basis that " it is the first number you count " . A fourth @-@ year referred to 0 as " none " and thought that it was neither odd nor even , since " it 's not a number " . In another study , Annie Keith observed a class of 15 second grade students who convinced each other that zero was an even number based on even @-@ odd alternation and on the possibility of splitting a group of zero things in two equal groups . 
 More in @-@ depth investigations were conducted by Esther Levenson , <unk> <unk> , and Dina <unk> , who interviewed a pair of sixth @-@ grade students who were performing highly in their mathematics class . One student preferred deductive explanations of mathematical claims , while the other preferred practical examples . Both students initially thought that 0 was neither even nor odd , for different reasons . Levenson et al. demonstrated how the students ' reasoning reflected their concepts of zero and division . 
 Deborah <unk> Ball analyzed a third grade class students ' ideas about even and odd numbers and zero , which they had just been discussing with a group of fourth @-@ graders . The students discussed the parity of zero , the rules for even numbers , and how mathematics is done . The claims about zero took many forms , as seen in the list on the right . Ball and her coauthors argued that the episode demonstrated how students can " do mathematics in school " , as opposed to the usual reduction of the discipline to the mechanical solution of exercises . 
 One of the themes in the research literature is the tension between students ' concept images of parity and their concept definitions . Levenson et al . ' s sixth @-@ graders both defined even numbers as multiples of 2 or numbers divisible by 2 , but they were initially unable to apply this definition to zero , because they were unsure how to multiply or divide zero by 2 . The interviewer eventually led them to conclude that zero was even ; the students took different routes to this conclusion , drawing on a combination of images , definitions , practical explanations , and abstract explanations . In another study , David Dickerson and Damien Pitman examined the use of definitions by five advanced undergraduate mathematics majors . They found that the undergraduates were largely able to apply the definition of " even " to zero , but they were still not convinced by this reasoning , since it conflicted with their concept images . 
 = = = Teachers ' knowledge = = = 
 Researchers of mathematics education at the University of Michigan have included the true @-@ or @-@ false prompt " 0 is an even number " in a database of over 250 questions designed to measure teachers ' content knowledge . For them , the question exemplifies " common knowledge ... that any well @-@ educated adult should have " , and it is " ideologically neutral " in that the answer does not vary between traditional and reform mathematics . In a 2000 – 2004 study of 700 primary teachers in the United States , overall performance on these questions significantly predicted improvements in students ' standardized test scores after taking the teachers ' classes . In a more in @-@ depth 2008 study , the researchers found a school where all of the teachers thought that zero was neither odd nor even , including one teacher who was exemplary by all other measures . The misconception had been spread by a math coach in their building . 
 It is uncertain how many teachers harbor misconceptions about zero . The Michigan studies did not publish data for individual questions . Betty Lichtenberg , an associate professor of mathematics education at the University of South Florida , in a 1972 study reported that when a group of prospective elementary school teachers were given a true @-@ or @-@ false test including the item " Zero is an even number " , they found it to be a " tricky question " , with about two thirds answering " False " . 
 = = = Implications for instruction = = = 
 Mathematically , proving that zero is even is a simple matter of applying a definition , but more explanation is needed in the context of education . One issue concerns the foundations of the proof ; the definition of " even " as " integer multiple of 2 " is not always appropriate . A student in the first years of primary education may not yet have learned what " integer " or " multiple " means , much less how to multiply with 0 . Additionally , stating a definition of parity for all integers can seem like an arbitrary conceptual shortcut if the only even numbers investigated so far have been positive . It can help to acknowledge that as the number concept is extended from positive integers to include zero and negative integers , number properties such as parity are also extended in a nontrivial way . 
 = = Numerical cognition = = 
 Adults who do believe that zero is even can nevertheless be unfamiliar with thinking of it as even , enough so to measurably slow them down in a reaction time experiment . Stanislas Dehaene , a pioneer in the field of numerical cognition , led a series of such experiments in the early 1990s . A numeral or a number word is flashed to the subject on a monitor , and a computer records the time it takes the subject to push one of two buttons to identify the number as odd or even . The results showed that 0 was slower to process than other even numbers . Some variations of the experiment found delays as long as 60 milliseconds or about 10 % of the average reaction time — a small difference but a significant one . 
 Dehaene 's experiments were not designed specifically to investigate 0 but to compare competing models of how parity information is processed and extracted . The most specific model , the mental calculation hypothesis , suggests that reactions to 0 should be fast ; 0 is a small number , and it is easy to calculate 0 × 2 
 = 0 . ( Subjects are known to compute and name the result of multiplication by zero faster than multiplication of nonzero numbers , although they are slower to verify proposed results like 2 × 0 = 
 0 . ) The results of the experiments suggested that something quite different was happening : parity information was apparently being recalled from memory along with a cluster of related properties , such as being prime or a power of two . Both the sequence of powers of two and the sequence of positive even numbers 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , ... are well @-@ distinguished mental categories whose members are prototypically even . Zero belongs to neither list , hence the slower responses . 
 Repeated experiments have shown a delay at zero for subjects with a variety of ages and national and linguistic backgrounds , confronted with number names in numeral form , spelled out , and spelled in a mirror image . Dehaene 's group did find one differentiating factor : mathematical expertise . In one of their experiments , students in the École Normale Supérieure were divided into two groups : those in literary studies and those studying mathematics , physics , or biology . The slowing at 0 was " essentially found in the [ literary ] group " , and in fact , " before the experiment , some L subjects were unsure whether 0 was odd or even and had to be reminded of the mathematical definition " . 
 This strong dependence on familiarity again undermines the mental calculation hypothesis . The effect also suggests that it is inappropriate to include zero in experiments where even and odd numbers are compared as a group . As one study puts it , " Most researchers seem to agree that zero is not a typical even number and should not be investigated as part of the mental number line . " 
 = = Everyday contexts = = 
 Some of the contexts where the parity of zero makes an appearance are purely rhetorical . The issue provides material for Internet message boards and ask @-@ the @-@ expert websites . Linguist Joseph Grimes muses that asking " Is zero an even number ? " to married couples is a good way to get them to disagree . People who think that zero is neither even nor odd may use the parity of zero as proof that every rule has a counterexample , or as an example of a trick question . 
 Around the year 2000 , media outlets noted a pair of unusual milestones : " 1999 / 11 / 19 " was the last calendar date composed of all odd digits that would occur for a very long time , and that " 2000 / 02 / 02 " was the first all @-@ even date to occur in a very long time . Since these results make use of 0 being even , some readers disagreed with the idea . 
 In standardized tests , if a question asks about the behavior of even numbers , it might be necessary to keep in mind that zero is even . Official publications relating to the GMAT and GRE tests both state that 0 is even . 
 The parity of zero is relevant to odd – even rationing , in which cars may drive or purchase gasoline on alternate days , according to the parity of the last digit in their license plates . Half of the numbers in a given range end in 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 and the other half in 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , so it makes sense to include 0 with the other even numbers . However , in 1977 , a Paris rationing system led to confusion : on an odd @-@ only day , the police avoided fining drivers whose plates ended in 0 , because they did not know whether 0 was even . To avoid such confusion , the relevant legislation sometimes stipulates that zero is even ; such laws have been passed in New South Wales and Maryland . 
 On U.S. Navy vessels , even @-@ numbered compartments are found on the port side , but zero is reserved for compartments that intersect the centerline . That is , the numbers read 6 @-@ 4 @-@ 2 @-@ 0 @-@ 1 @-@ 3 @-@ 5 from port to starboard . In the game of roulette , the number 0 does not count as even or odd , giving the casino an advantage on such bets . Similarly , the parity of zero can affect payoffs in prop bets when the outcome depends on whether some randomized number is odd or even , and it turns out to be zero . 
 The game of " odds and evens " is also affected : if both players cast zero fingers , the total number of fingers is zero , so the even player wins . One teachers ' manual suggests playing this game as a way to introduce children to the concept that 0 is divisible by 2 .

 17th Precinct is a police procedural television program created by Ronald D. Moore . In a modern world where magic supplanted science , the unaired pilot featured two non @-@ intersecting stories : the death of a city executive at the hands of a wrongful convict , and the introduction of terrorists who are devoted to the destruction of magic . Moore developed the series with Sony Pictures Television for NBCUniversal , bringing with him several of the stars of his reimagined Battlestar Galactica franchise as cast members . The series was pitched in September 2010 , the pilot was ordered January 2011 , NBC passed on the series in May 2011 , and the unaired pilot was leaked in December 2011 . Reviewers mostly liked 17th Precinct , commenting on its innovativeness despite its police procedural roots .

 The series takes place in the American city of Excelsior ( shot in Vancouver , modeled on San Francisco ) , in a world where science was never " invented " , and instead of using " oil , electricity , [ and ] coal " , mankind relies on <unk> and fire @-@ powered magic to run society . The police of Excelsior 's 17th Precinct use spells to collect evidence and information , they defend themselves with " magic discs " , and they psychically access " the stream " ( a smokey light beam ) for information , printouts , and newspapers .

 Donald Pynchon , Excelsior 's executive prophet ( a city government official concerned with making and interpreting city @-@ wide prophesies ) , is murdered in a North Beach back alley on September 23 , 2011 . Detectives Longstreet and Bosson ( Bamber & Callis ) are tasked with the case and determine that his murder was intentionally brutal , and it was unobserved due to a magical charm which deadened sound in the alley . It turns out that fifteen years previously , Pynchon was in Mendocino , California when , relying on a prophetic vision , testified against Lionel Dixon on charges of rape and murder . Dixon received a life sentence of magically reliving his victim 's final experiences . After Dixon was acquitted thirteen years later , he was magically given a new life as a child ( Quinn Lord ) in an effort to make up for the mistaken identity ; Dixon instead was driven to murder both Pynchon and the acquitting judge . 
 Unconnected with the Pynchon case , DCI Wilder Blanks ( Walker ) begins seeing visions related to the Stoics , " a group dedicated to the destruction of magic " in favor of " reason , rationality , and [ ... ] science " — a laughable prospect , but one about which they are deadly serious . Twelve years previously ( 1999 ) , the Stoics committed a series of murders to further their cause , but have neither been seen nor heard of since . Blanks retrieves DS Mira Barkley ( Channing ) from her dissatisfying work in another precinct to help with the Stoics ; Barkley was his partner during the previous Stoics case . Blanks partners Barkley with rookie detective Jimmy Travers ( Long ) due to the latter 's potential as an intuitive savant . Investigating a nuisance case in an apartment building , Barkley and Travers unwittingly allow the Stoics access to murder an otherwise protected tenant , a college professor of " advanced magical engineering and biology with an emphasis on power plant design . " In the dénouement , it is revealed that the Stoics use " mechanical , rather than ' true ' magic " which nothing in their world can defend against ; the professor was killed using the Stoics ' means , something called a bullet .

 = Typhoon Nepartak ( 2003 ) = 
 Typhoon Nepartak , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Weng , was a modest tropical cyclone that struck the central Philippines and the southern China island of Hainan in November 2003 . Forming as a tropical depression on November 11 between Yap and Guam , the system moved westward and slowly intensified . It received the name Nepartak midday on November 12 from the Japan Meteorological Agency , becoming the 20th named storm of the 2003 Pacific typhoon season . On November 13 , <unk> struck Samar in the Philippines and bisected the island chain . Up to four million people lost power , and transportation ground to a halt ; over 5 @,@ 000 individuals became stranded on ships forced to stay in port during the tropical storm . It was reported that 13 individuals lost their lives to the storm in the Philippines . 
 After entering the open waters of the South China Sea , Nepartak continued to intensify and turned more toward the northwest . It attained its peak intensity on November 16 , with maximum 10 ‑ minute sustained winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) and 1 @-@ minute winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) . After weakening slightly , the storm found a weakness in the easterly steering currents and bore north , reintensifying slightly and directly striking southwestern Hainan . There , heavy rainfall and strong winds destroyed crops , livestock , and hundreds of homes , leaving $ 197 million ( 2003 USD ) in damage . The storm rapidly deteriorated in the Gulf of Tonkin and dissipated as it neared mainland China . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Nepartak originated in a region of strong thunderstorm activity , associated with a broad trough of low surface pressure , which was situated around 640 km ( 400 mi ) southeast of Guam by 0000 UTC on November 11 . With weak wind shear and modest divergence of air over the system , it began to mature , although initially the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) downplayed the potential for tropical cyclogenesis . Over the next several hours , a low @-@ level circulation center became evident and convection organized around it , prompting the JTWC to issue an updated outlook . At 1800 UTC , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the storm as a tropical depression while it was located northeast of Yap in the Caroline Islands . The JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system at 2030 UTC , and designated it Tropical Depression 25W at 1200 UTC on November 12 . The system intensified gradually as it began to track quickly westward toward the Philippines . 
 The depression had found its way to the southwestern quadrant of a large anticyclone aloft , allowing for continued strengthening . Both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm midday on November 12 , when it gained the name Nepartak from the JMA . Simultaneously , the cyclone entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration , which named it Tropical Storm Weng . <unk> , the storm began to exhibit improved outflow and deepening convection as it neared the central Philippines . At around 1600 UTC on November 13 , Nepartak made landfall on northern Samar Island in the Philippines before traversing the remainder of the archipelago from east to west . The cyclone emerged into the South China Sea briefly weakened and with reduced forward motion , but quickly resumed its intensification trend as it turned more toward the northwest . Shortly thereafter — at 0000 UTC on November 15 — the JTWC further upgraded 25W to a typhoon . 
 Continuing generally toward the west @-@ northwest under steering currents from a mid @-@ level ridge to its north , Nepartak maintained its windspeeds throughout the day . With an improving appearance on satellite imagery , however , the storm gained some additional strength , and the JTWC estimated 25W to have attained its first peak intensity with maximum 1 ‑ minute sustained winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) at 0000 UTC on November 16 . Later that day , the JMA determined Nepartak to have reached maximum 10 @-@ minute winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) , placing it at typhoon status . The cyclonic envelope began to ingest dry air from its surroundings , and convection began to wane , leading to slight weakening as the storm approached the island of Hainan . A shortwave trough soon cut a weakness in the mid @-@ level ridge which had previously suppressed Nepartak to the south , allowing the cyclone to curve north and enhancing outflow over the storm . By late on November 17 , a small eye feature about 19 km ( 12 mi ) in diameter had formed , and at 0000 UTC the next day it was situated just offshore southwestern Hainan . 
 The cyclone 's 1 @-@ minute winds increased once again to 140 km / h , marking its second and final peak at 0000 UTC on November 18 . The JMA , however , maintained Nepartak as a severe tropical storm . The JTWC indicated that 25W made a second landfall on the coast of Hainan , although the JMA did not make such mention , implying Nepartak 's center remained over the Gulf of Tonkin . Regardless , the cyclone 's circulation had obscured most of Hainan and the Gulf of Tonkin and reached into adjacent Vietnam , and its forward speed slowed to a crawl . Extended interaction with land proved detrimental to the storm , and it began to rapidly disintegrate . Just 18 hours after its final bout of strengthening , Nepartak had been reduced to an exposed circulation center with no associated thunderstorms . Turning toward the northeast , the system had been concurrently downgraded to a tropical depression by the JTWC and JMA early on November 19 . The weak remnant low of Nepartak limped ashore over Beihai , China at 1900 UTC and dissipated shortly thereafter . 
 = = Impact = = 
 On its first landfall , the tropical storm buffeted the eastern @-@ central Philippines with damaging winds gusting up to 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) , heavy rainfall , and rough seas . At least 20 provinces experienced adverse or dangerous weather , with the worst conditions concentrated over the islands of Samar and Masbate . While structural and crop damages were limited , local infrastructure and transportation suffered the greatest . Nepartak 's winds caused complete power outages on Samar , Masbate , and nearby Marinduque , affecting their entire collective population of nearly four million individuals . Many schools were closed . The storm forced the cancellation of nearly two dozen domestic flights to and from the region , and at least 120 ferries and other vessels sought shelter in ports around the Manila , Bicol , and Visayas regions . On those ships were more than 5 @,@ 000 people who became stranded until safe passage could be made . By November 15 , five deaths had been confirmed in the Philippines , four the result of electrocutions from downed powerlines . Immediately following the disaster , then @-@ President Gloria Macapagal @-@ Arroyo made assisting the stranded passengers in coastal ports a priority . According to the PAGASA in its post @-@ storm report , a total of 13 people lost their lives , 5 others remained unaccounted for , and 11 sustained injuries . One newspaper reported that a motorized craft in the <unk> Strait capsized at the height of the storm , forcing the rescue of 11 people . Another source also describes the sinking of a boat with at least 13 survivors and one fatality . It is not clear whether these accounts cover the same incident . 
 Nepartak inflicted widespread destruction on Hainan , including damage to farms and buildings . Most of the island was subject to strong winds and torrential rains , but the storm helped to relieve one of the worst summer droughts in almost 65 years . Due to the danger , shipping was halted in the Qiongzhou Strait between November 16 and 19 . Nepartak impacted at least 1 @.@ 72 million people on Hainan , compromised infrastructure , and impeded industry . The storm halted the operation of mines and rendered 72 highways temporarily unusable . Crops suffered extensively ; 64 @,@ 000 ha ( 160 @,@ 000 acres ) of fields were damaged , reducing grain production by as much as 3 @,@ 200 tons . In addition , 400 head of livestock were lost to the typhoon . With about 800 homes destroyed , damage on Hainan amounted to $ 197 million ( 2003 USD ) , and no fatalities were reported . Following the storm , a young male sperm whale weighing over 500 kg ( 1100 lb ) washed ashore near <unk> City on the island 's southern shore , and died shortly after . Biologists speculated that the whale 's demise may have been related to typhoon , although this was not confirmed . 
 By the time the storm had begun to abate over Hainan , it was already nearly dissipated , and as a result produced few , if any , noticeable effects in mainland China . Across the Gulf of Tonkin , Vietnam had experienced deadly flooding in the week before Nepartak 's approach , and the typhoon initially raised concerns about worsening the situation . Officials made preparations to minimize potentially exacerbating factors , and the cyclone remained far enough east to avoid seriously impacting the country .

After recording his first point with an assist on October 14 against the Columbus Blue Jackets , Getzlaf scored his first NHL goal seven days later against goaltender Manny Legace of the Detroit Red Wings . Though Getzlaf had seven points in his first 16 games with Anaheim , he was demoted to the AHL 's Portland Pirates in mid @-@ November , partially to gain more playing time than he was getting in Anaheim . He appeared in 17 games for the Pirates in which he scored 8 goals and added 25 assists . Along with teammate Corey Perry , Getzlaf shared AHL co @-@ rookie of the month honours for December and while he was named to play in the 2006 AHL All @-@ Star game , Getzlaf did not appear in the contest as he was recalled to Anaheim in mid @-@ January . He completed the season in the NHL , and finished with 14 goals and 39 points in 57 regular season games , then added seven points in 16 post @-@ season contests . 
 In his sophomore season with the newly renamed Anaheim Ducks , Getzlaf appeared in all 82 regular season games for the team and finished with 25 goals and 58 points . He played in the YoungStars Game at the 2007 NHL All @-@ Star Game in Dallas .

Getzlaf led the Ducks in post @-@ season scoring with 17 points , at the time a franchise playoff record , as the Ducks defeated the Ottawa Senators in the final series . It was the first Stanley Cup championship in Anaheim 's franchise history . 
 The " kid line " was broken up prior to the 2007 – 08 season after Penner signed a contract as a restricted free agent with the Edmonton Oilers , however Getzlaf opted to remain in Anaheim . He signed a five @-@ year , $ 26 @.@ 625 million extension that carried through the 2012 – 13 season . Getzlaf emerged as one of the NHL 's top young stars as he played in his first All @-@ Star Game in 2008 , and led the Ducks in both assists ( 58 ) and points ( 82 ) . 
 Getzlaf tied a Ducks franchise record early in the 2008 – 09 season as he recorded five assists in a 5 – 4 victory over the Detroit Red Wings on October 29 , 2008 .

Ducks ' Head Coach Randy Carlyle described the promotion of the 25 @-@ year @-@ old in terms of Getzlaf 's maturation as an NHL player . He added , " We felt that with it being his sixth season in the League , now is the time for the transition and the veteran players agreed with us . " During the season , he suffered multiple nasal sinus fractures after being struck in the face by a puck , and consequently appeared in only 67 games ; he recorded 19 goals . Getzlaf 's 57 assists ranked fourth in the NHL and he added six points in six post @-@ season contests , including his 50th career playoff point . 
 Getzlaf played his 500th career game on March 12 , 2012 , a 3 – 2 loss to the Colorado Avalanche . He played all 82 games for the Ducks in 2011 – 12 and led the team with 46 assists .

 Moving up to the national junior team , Getzlaf made his first of two appearances at the World Junior Hockey Championship in 2004 . He recorded six points in six games for a dominant Canadian squad that scored 25 goals in its four round @-@ robin games and surrendered only four en route to a gold medal showdown with the United States . With Canada leading 3 – 1 early in the third period of the final , both Getzlaf and Sidney Crosby failed to capitalize on opportunities to add an extra goal that may have sealed a victory . Instead , Canada surrendered the lead , and Getzlaf and his teammates were forced to settle for the silver medal after goaltender Marc @-@ André Fleury accidentally sent a clearing pass off a teammate and into his own net for the game @-@ winning goal . 
 The 2004 – 05 lockout ensured that several players who would otherwise have been playing in the NHL , including Getzlaf , were available to return to the national team for the 2005 World Junior Championship . One of 12 players with previous experience at the tournament for Canada , Getzlaf was a leading player for what many observers have called the greatest team in the tournament 's history . With 12 points in 6 games , Getzlaf finished second in overall scoring to teammate Patrice Bergeron 's 13 . He scored one goal and added two assists in the championship game against Russia as the Canadians won the gold medal by a 6 – 1 score ; it was the nation 's first title in eight years at the event .

Getzlaf was named to the Canadian roster for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver , however a sprained ankle suffered during the NHL season left his participation in doubt until just before Canada was required to confirm its roster . He had recovered enough to play and recorded seven points in seven games , including the game @-@ winning goal in Canada 's 3 – 2 semi @-@ final victory over Slovakia . Canada won the gold medal with a 3 – 2 overtime victory over the United States .

However , Canada was eliminated in the quarterfinal against Slovakia , 4 – 3 . Getzlaf was assessed a major penalty and game misconduct late in the game for kneeing Juraj <unk> . A dejected Getzlaf lamented the result and his penalty following the game : " It hurts like hell right now . I feel like I let the guys down . To be in a hard @-@ fought game like that and play the tournament we did and lose in that fashion , it 's not easy to swallow as a group . " 
 Returning to the Canadian roster for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi , Getzlaf 's play was cited , along with that of fellow centres Sidney Crosby and Jonathan Toews , as being one of the key aspects of Canada 's successful defence of their Olympic title . Canada defeated Sweden by a 3 – 0 score to win the gold medal and repeat as Olympic champions .

 = German cruiser Blücher = 
 Blücher was the second of five Admiral Hipper @-@ class heavy cruisers of Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine , built after the rise of the Nazi Party and the repudiation of the Treaty of Versailles . Named for Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher , the Prussian victor of the Battle of Waterloo , the ship was laid down in August 1936 and launched in June 1937 . She was completed in September 1939 , shortly after the outbreak of World War II . After completing a series of sea trials and training exercises , the ship was pronounced ready for service with the fleet on 5 April 1940 . 
 Assigned to Group 5 during the invasion of Norway in April 1940 , Blücher served as Konteradmiral Oskar Kummetz 's flagship . The ship led the flotilla of warships into the Oslofjord on the night of 8 April , to seize Oslo , the capital of Norway . Two old 28 cm ( 11 in ) coastal guns in the Oscarsborg Fortress engaged the ship at very close range , scoring two hits . Two torpedoes fired by land @-@ based torpedo batteries struck the ship , causing serious damage . A major fire broke out aboard Blücher , which could not be contained . After a magazine explosion , the ship sank , with major loss of life . The wreck remains on the bottom of the Oslofjord . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Blücher was ordered by the Kriegsmarine from the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel . Her keel was laid on 15 August 1936 , under construction number 246 . The ship was launched on 8 June 1937 , and was completed slightly over two years later , on 20 September 1939 , the day she was commissioned into the German fleet . The commanding admiral of the <unk> der Ostsee ( Baltic Naval Station ) , Admiral Conrad Albrecht , gave the christening speech . Frau Erdmann , widow of Fregattenkapitän Alexander Erdmann , former commander of SMS Blücher , performed the christening . As built , the ship had a straight stem , though after her launch this was replaced with a clipper bow increasing the overall length to 205 @.@ 90 meters ( 675 @.@ 5 ft ) . A raked funnel cap was also installed . 
 As launched , Blücher was 202 @.@ 80 meters ( 665 @.@ 4 ft ) long overall , had a beam of 21 @.@ 30 m ( 69 @.@ 9 ft ) and a maximum draft of 7 @.@ 74 m ( 25 @.@ 4 ft ) . The ship had a design displacement of 16 @,@ 170 t ( 15 @,@ 910 long tons ; 17 @,@ 820 short tons ) and a full load displacement of 18 @,@ 200 long tons ( 18 @,@ 500 t ) . Blücher was powered by three sets of geared steam turbines , which were supplied with steam by twelve ultra @-@ high pressure oil @-@ fired boilers . The ship 's top speed was 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) , at 132 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 98 @,@ 000 kW ) . As designed , her standard complement consisted of 42 officers and 1 @,@ 340 enlisted men . 
 Blücher 's primary armament was eight 20 @.@ 3 cm ( 8 @.@ 0 in ) SK L / 60 guns mounted in four twin gun turrets , placed in superfiring pairs forward and aft . Her anti @-@ aircraft battery consisted of twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) L / 65 guns , twelve 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns , and eight 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) guns . The ship would also have carried a pair of triple 53 @.@ 3 cm ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo launchers abreast of the rear superstructure . She had four triple 53 @.@ 3 cm ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo launchers , all on the main deck next to the four FLAK range finders . The ship was equipped with three Arado Ar 196 seaplanes and one catapult . Blucher never had more than two seaplanes onboard and en route to Oslo one had to rest on the catapult as one of the hangars was used for storing bombs and torpedoes . Blücher 's armored belt was 70 to 80 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 to 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick ; her upper deck was 12 to 30 mm ( 0 @.@ 47 to 1 @.@ 18 in ) thick while the main armored deck was 20 to 50 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 to 1 @.@ 97 in ) thick . The main battery turrets had 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) thick faces and 70 mm thick sides .

 Blücher spent the majority of November 1939 fitting out and finishing additional improvements . By the end of the month , the ship was ready for sea trials ; she steamed to Gotenhafen in the Baltic Sea . The trials lasted until mid @-@ December , after which the ship returned to Kiel for final modifications . In January 1940 , she resumed her exercises in the Baltic , but by the middle of the month , severe ice forced the ship to remain in port . On 5 April , she was deemed to be ready for action , and was therefore assigned to the forces participating in the invasion of Norway . 
 = = = Operation Weserübung = = = 
 On 5 April 1940 , Konteradmiral Oskar Kummetz came aboard the ship while she was in Swinemünde . An 800 @-@ strong detachment of ground troops from the 163rd Infantry Division also boarded . Three days later , on 8 April , Blücher left port , bound for Norway ; she was the flagship for the force that was to seize Oslo , the Norwegian capital . Organized as Group 5 of the invasion force she was accompanied by the heavy cruiser Lützow , the light cruiser Emden , and several smaller escorts . While steaming through the Kattegat and Skagerrak , the British submarine Triton spotted the convoy and fired a spread of torpedoes ; the Germans successfully evaded the torpedoes , however , and proceeded with the mission . 
 Night had fallen by the time the German flotilla reached the approaches to the Oslofjord . Shortly after 23 : 00 ( Norwegian time ) the flotilla was spotted by the Norwegian patrol boat Pol III . The German torpedo boat Albatros attacked Pol III and set her on fire , but not before the Norwegian patrol boat raised the alarm with a radio report of being attacked by unknown warships . At 23 : 30 ( Norwegian time ) the south battery on Rauøy spotted the flotilla in the searchlight and fired two warning shots . Five minutes later , the guns at the Rauøy battery fired four rounds at the approaching Germans , but visibility was poor and no hits were scored . The guns at Bolærne fired only one warning shot at 23 : 32 . Before Blücher could be targeted again , she was out of the firing sector of these shore guns and was seen no more by them after 23 : 35 . 
 The German flotilla steamed on at a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . Shortly after midnight ( Norwegian time ) , an order from the Commanding Admiral to extinguish all lighthouses and navigation lights was broadcast over the NRK ( Norsk <unk> ) [ Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation ] . The German ships had been ordered to fire only in the event they were directly fired on first . Between 00 : 30 and 02 : 00 , the flotilla stopped and 150 infantrymen of the landing force were transferred to the escorts R17 and R21 ( from Emden ) and R18 and R19 ( from Blücher ) . 
 The R @-@ boats were ordered to engage Rauøy , Bolærne and the naval port and city of Horten . Despite the apparent loss of surprise , the Blücher proceeded further into the fjord to continue with the timetable to reach Oslo by dawn . At 04 : 40 , Norwegian searchlights again illuminated the ship and at 04 : 21 the 28 cm ( 11 in ) guns of Oscarsborg Fortress opened fire on Blücher at very close range , beginning the Battle of Drøbak Sound with two hits on her port side . The first was high above the bridge , hitting the battle station for the commander of the anti @-@ aircraft guns , killing AO II Kapitänleutnant Hans @-@ Erich <unk> . The main range finder in the top of the battle mast was knocked out of alignment , but Blücher had four more major rangefinders ( B @-@ turret , on the bridge roof , the aft battle station ( <unk> ) and C @-@ turret ) and many smaller on the bridge and the four rangefinder stations for the AA . The commander in D @-@ turret , <unk> Waldeck , stated that the first 28 cm hit had no influence on the battle capability of the 20 @.@ 3 cm guns . Blücher immediately returned fire . 
 = = = Fire starts = = = 
 The second 28 cm shell struck near the aircraft hangar and started a major fire . As the fire spread , it detonated explosives carried for the infantry , hindering firefighting efforts . The explosion set fire to the two Arado seaplanes onboard : one on the catapult and the other in one of the hangars . The explosion also probably punched a hole in the armored deck over turbine room 1 . Turbine 1 and generator room 3 stopped for lack of steam and only the outboard shafts from turbine room 2 / 3 were operational . 
 The Germans were unable to locate the source of the gunfire . Blücher increased speed to 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) in an attempt to get past the Norwegian guns . The 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns on Drøbak , some 400 yd ( 370 m ) on Blücher 's starboard side , opened fire as well . At a distance of 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) Blücher entered the narrows between Kopås and <unk> ( the main battery ) at <unk> . The Kopås battery ceased firing at Blücher and engaged the next target , Lützow , scoring multiple hits . First engineer <unk> Ingenieur Fregattenkapitän Dip . Ing . Karl <unk> wrote in his report that the hits from the guns on Drøbak , which were fired on the starboard side , were all between section IV and X in a length of 75 metres ( 246 ft ) amidships , between B @-@ turret and C @-@ turret . However , all damage were on the port side . The shells must have traversed most of the superstructure before exploding . 
 After the first salvo from the 15 cm batteries in Drøbak , the steering from the bridge was disabled . Blücher had just passed <unk> ( Drøbak shallows ) and was in a turn to port . The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts , but she lost speed . Normally the rudder is controlled electrically from the bridge to the motors forward of the <unk> ( hand steering room ) deep under the armored deck , forward of the rudder . In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual steering , but orders from the bridge to the rudder may be delayed . At 04 : 34 Norwegian land @-@ based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship . The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive . The speed of the torpedo was known and set , but the speed of the target had to be adjusted by Dead reckoning ( guessing ) . 
 According to Admiral Kummetz ' report , the first torpedo hit <unk> 2 ( <unk> 2 , just under the funnel ) and the second hit <unk> 2 / 3 ( the turbine room for the side shafts ) . Boiler 1 had already been destroyed by gunfire . Only one boiler remained , but the steam pipes through boiler 1 and 2 and turbine room 2 / 3 had been damaged and turbine 1 for the main shaft lost its power . By 04 : 34 , the ship had been severely damaged , but had successfully passed through the firing zone ; the Norwegian guns could no longer bear on her . The 15 cm guns in the Kopås battery were all standing in open positions with a wide sector of firing . After the torpedo hits , Blücher was still within range . The battery asked for orders , but Eriksen concluded : The fortress has served its purpose With all propellers stopped , about 60 % of the electric power gone , Blucher quickly lost speed and at about 04 : 50 dropped anchors at <unk> . 
 = = = Sinking = = = 
 After passing the gun batteries , the crew of Blücher , including the personnel manning the guns , were tasked with fighting the fire . By that time she had taken on a list of 18 degrees , although this was not initially problematic . The fire eventually reached one of the ship 's 10 @.@ 5 cm ammunition magazines between turbine room 1 and turbine room 2 / 3 , which exploded violently . The blast ruptured several bulkheads in the engine rooms and ignited the ship 's fuel stores . The battered ship slowly began to capsize and the order to abandon ship was given . Blücher rolled over and sank at 07 : 30 , with significant casualties . Naval historian Erich Gröner states that the number of casualties is unknown , but Henrik Lunde gives a loss of life figure ranging between 600 and 1 @,@ 000 soldiers and sailors . Jürgen Rohwer meanwhile states that 125 seamen and 195 soldiers died in the sinking . 
 The loss of Blücher and the damage done to Lützow caused the German force to withdraw . The ground troops were landed on the eastern side of the fjord ; they proceeded inland and captured the <unk> Fortress by 09 : 00 on 10 April . They then moved on to attack the capital . Airborne troops captured the Fornebu Airport and completed the encirclement of the city , and by 14 : 00 on 10 April it was in German hands . The delay caused by the temporary withdrawal of Blücher 's task force , however , allowed the Norwegian government and royal family to escape the city . 
 Blücher remains at the bottom of the Drøbak Narrows , at a depth of 35 fathoms ( 210 ft ; 64 m ) . The ship 's screws were removed in 1953 , and there have been several proposals to raise the wreck since 1963 , but none have been carried out . When Blücher left Germany , she had about 2 @,@ 670 cubic metres ( 94 @,@ 000 cu ft ) of oil on board . She expended some of the fuel en route to Norway , and some was lost in the sinking , but she was constantly leaking oil . In 1991 the leakage rate increased to 50 liters ( 11 imp gal ; 13 U.S. gal ) per day , threatening the environment . The Norwegian government therefore decided to remove as much oil as possible from the wreck . In October 1994 the company Rockwater AS , together with deep sea divers drilled holes in 133 fuel tanks and removed 1 @,@ 000 t ( 980 long tons ; 1 @,@ 100 short tons ) of oil ; 47 fuel bunkers were unreachable and may still contain oil . After being run through a cleaning process , the oil was sold . The oil extraction operation provided an opportunity to recover one of Blücher 's two Arado 196 aircraft . The plane was raised on 9 November 1994 and is currently at the <unk> Museum , Sola aviation museum near Stavanger . 
 The shipwreck was 16 . June 2016 protected as a war memorial , but also protected by law by Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage for those who actually have their burial at the bottom of the fjord . The intention was to protect the ship from wreck looters . 
 = High @-@ level radioactive waste management = 
 High @-@ level radioactive waste management concerns how radioactive materials created during production of nuclear power and nuclear weapons are dealt with . Radioactive waste contains a mixture of short @-@ lived and long @-@ lived nuclides , as well as non @-@ radioactive nuclides . There was reported some 47 @,@ 000 tonnes of high @-@ level nuclear waste stored in the USA in 2002 . 
 The most troublesome transuranic elements in spent fuel are neptunium @-@ 237 ( half @-@ life two million years ) and plutonium @-@ 239 ( half @-@ life 24 @,@ 000 years ) . Consequently , high @-@ level radioactive waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from the biosphere . This usually necessitates treatment , followed by a long @-@ term management strategy involving permanent storage , disposal or transformation of the waste into a non @-@ toxic form . Radioactive decay follows the half @-@ life rule , which means that the rate of decay is inversely proportional to the duration of decay . In other words , the radiation from a long @-@ lived isotope like iodine @-@ 129 will be much less intense than that of short @-@ lived isotope like iodine @-@ 131 . 
 Governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options , usually involving deep @-@ geologic placement , although there has been limited progress toward implementing long @-@ term waste management solutions . This is partly because the timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from 10 @,@ 000 to millions of years , according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses . 
 Thus , Alfvén identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high @-@ level radioactive waste : ( 1 ) stable geological formations , and ( 2 ) stable human institutions over hundreds of thousands of years . As Alfvén suggests , no known human civilization has ever endured for so long , and no geologic formation of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period . Nevertheless , avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude . Radioactive waste management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns , examined in the light of uncertainty and futurity : consideration of ' the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations ' . 
 There is a debate over what should constitute an acceptable scientific and engineering foundation for proceeding with radioactive waste disposal strategies . There are those who have argued , on the basis of complex geochemical simulation models , that relinquishing control over radioactive materials to <unk> processes at repository closure is an acceptable risk . They maintain that so @-@ called " natural analogues " inhibit subterranean movement of radionuclides , making disposal of radioactive wastes in stable geologic formations unnecessary . However , existing models of these processes are empirically <unk> : due to the subterranean nature of such processes in solid geologic formations , the accuracy of computer simulation models has not been verified by empirical observation , certainly not over periods of time equivalent to the lethal half @-@ lives of high @-@ level radioactive waste . On the other hand , some insist deep geologic repositories in stable geologic formations are necessary . National management plans of various countries display a variety of approaches to resolving this debate . 
 Researchers suggest that forecasts of health detriment for such long periods should be examined critically . Practical studies only consider up to 100 years as far as effective planning and cost evaluations are concerned . Long term behaviour of radioactive wastes remains a subject for ongoing research . Management strategies and implementation plans of several representative national governments are described below . 
 = = Geologic disposal = = 
 The International Panel on <unk> Materials has said : 
 It is widely accepted that spent nuclear fuel and high @-@ level reprocessing and plutonium wastes require well @-@ designed storage for periods ranging from tens of thousands to a million years , to minimize releases of the contained radioactivity into the environment . <unk> are also required to ensure that neither plutonium nor highly enriched uranium is diverted to weapon use . There is general agreement that placing spent nuclear fuel in repositories hundreds of meters below the surface would be safer than indefinite storage of spent fuel on the surface . 
 The process of selecting appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel is now under way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017 . The basic concept is to locate a large , stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel , or large @-@ bore tunnel boring machines ( similar to those used to drill the <unk> from England to France ) to drill a shaft 500 – 1 @,@ 000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high @-@ level radioactive waste . The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment . However , many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system , suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent . 
 Because some radioactive species have half @-@ lives longer than one million years , even very low container leakage and radionuclide migration rates must be taken into account . Moreover , it may require more than one half @-@ life until some nuclear materials lose enough radioactivity to no longer be lethal to living organisms . A 1983 review of the Swedish radioactive waste disposal program by the National Academy of Sciences found that country ’ s estimate of several hundred thousand years — perhaps up to one million years — being necessary for waste isolation " fully justified . " 
 The proposed land @-@ based <unk> waste disposal method would dispose of nuclear waste in a subduction zone accessed from land , and therefore is not prohibited by international agreement . This method has been described as a viable means of disposing of radioactive waste , and as a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art nuclear waste disposal technology . 
 In nature , sixteen repositories were discovered at the Oklo mine in Gabon where natural nuclear fission reactions took place 1 @.@ 7 billion years ago . The fission products in these natural formations were found to have moved less than 10 ft ( 3 m ) over this period , though the lack of movement may be due more to retention in the uraninite structure than to insolubility and <unk> from moving ground water ; uraninite crystals are better preserved here than those in spent fuel rods because of a less complete nuclear reaction , so that reaction products would be less accessible to groundwater attack . 
 = = Materials for geological disposal = = 
 In order to store the high level radioactive waste in long @-@ term geological depositories , specific waste forms need to be used which will allow the radioactivity to decay away while the materials retain their integrity for thousands of years . The materials being used can be broken down into a few classes : glass waste forms , ceramic waste forms , and nanostructured materials . 
 The glass forms include borosilicate glasses and phosphate glasses . Borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste in many countries which are producers of nuclear energy or have nuclear weaponry . The glass waste forms have the advantage of being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste @-@ stream compositions , they are easy to scale up to industrial processing , and they are stable against thermal , radiative , and chemical perturbations . These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass @-@ forming elements . Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses , which make them a more favorable option . However , no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions . Both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile <unk> elements . 
 The ceramic waste forms offer higher waste loadings than the glass options because ceramics have crystalline structure . Also , mineral analogues of the ceramic waste forms provide evidence for long term durability . Due to this fact and the fact that they can be processed at lower temperatures , ceramics are often considered the next generation in high level radioactive waste forms . Ceramic waste forms offer great potential , but a lot of research remains to be done . 
 = = National management plans = = 
 Finland , the United States and Sweden are the most advanced in developing a deep repository for high @-@ level radioactive waste disposal . Countries vary in their plans on disposing used fuel directly or after reprocessing , with France and Japan having an extensive commitment to reprocessing . The country @-@ specific status of high @-@ level waste management plans are described below . 
 In many European countries ( e.g. , Britain , Finland , the Netherlands , Sweden and Switzerland ) the risk or dose limit for a member of the public exposed to radiation from a future high @-@ level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the International Commission on Radiation Protection or proposed in the United States . European limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the International Commission on Radiation Protection by a factor of 20 , and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) for Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository for the first 10 @,@ 000 years after closure . Moreover , the U.S. EPA ’ s proposed standard for greater than 10 @,@ 000 years is 250 times more permissive than the European limit . 
 The countries that have made the most progress towards a repository for high @-@ level radioactive waste have typically started with public consultations and made voluntary siting a necessary condition . This consensus seeking approach is believed to have a greater chance of success than top @-@ down modes of decision making , but the process is necessarily slow , and there is " inadequate experience around the world to know if it will succeed in all existing and aspiring nuclear nations " . 
 Moreover , most communities do not want to host a nuclear waste repository as they are " concerned about their community becoming a de facto site for waste for thousands of years , the health and environmental consequences of an accident , and lower property values " .

 In the Peoples Republic of China , ten reactors provide about 2 % of electricity and five more are under construction . China made a commitment to reprocessing in the 1980s ; a pilot plant is under construction at Lanzhou , where a temporary spent fuel storage facility has been constructed . Geological disposal has been studied since 1985 , and a permanent deep geological repository was required by law in 2003 . Sites in Gansu Province near the Gobi desert in northwestern China are under investigation , with a final site expected to be selected by 2020 , and actual disposal by about 2050 .

 In the Republic of China , nuclear waste storage facility was built at the Southern tip of Orchid Island in Taitung County , offshore of Taiwan Island . The facility was built in 1982 and it is owned and operated by <unk> . The facility receives nuclear waste from <unk> 's current three nuclear power plants . However , due to the strong resistance from local community in the island , the nuclear waste has to be stored at the power plant facilities themselves .

 Sixteen nuclear reactors produce about 3 % of India ’ s electricity , and seven more are under construction . Spent fuel is processed at facilities in Trombay near Mumbai , at <unk> on the west coast north of Mumbai , and at Kalpakkam on the southeast coast of India . Plutonium will be used in a fast breeder reactor ( under construction ) to produce more fuel , and other waste vitrified at <unk> and Trombay . Interim storage for 30 years is expected , with eventual disposal in a deep geological repository in crystalline rock near Kalpakkam . 
 = = = = Japan = = = = 
 In 2000 , a Specified Radioactive Waste Final Disposal Act called for creation of a new organization to manage high level radioactive waste , and later that year the Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Japan ( <unk> ) was established under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry . <unk> is responsible for selecting a permanent deep geological repository site , construction , operation and closure of the facility for waste emplacement by 2040 . Site selection began in 2002 and application information was sent to 3 @,@ 239 municipalities , but by 2006 , no local government had volunteered to host the facility . Kōchi Prefecture showed interest in 2007 , but its mayor resigned due to local opposition . In December 2013 the government decided to identify suitable candidate areas before approaching municipalities . 
 The head of the Science Council of Japan ’ s expert panel has said Japan 's seismic conditions makes it difficult to predict ground conditions over the necessary 100 @,@ 000 years , so it will be impossible to convince the public of the safety of deep geological disposal .

 = = = = Belgium = = = = 
 Belgium has seven nuclear reactors that provide about 52 % of its electricity . Belgian spent nuclear fuel was initially sent for reprocessing in France . In 1993 , reprocessing was suspended following a resolution of the Belgian parliament ; spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants . The deep disposal of high @-@ level radioactive waste ( HLW ) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years . Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal . The Hades underground research laboratory ( URL ) is located at − 223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site . The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice Economic Interest Group , a joint organisation between <unk> • CEN , the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and <unk> / <unk> , the Belgian agency for radioactive waste management . In Belgium , the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing approval is the Federal Agency of Nuclear Control , created in 2001 . 
 = = = = Finland = = = = 
 In 1983 , the government decided to select a site for permanent repository by 2010 . With four nuclear reactors providing 29 % of its electricity , Finland in 1987 enacted a Nuclear Energy Act making the producers of radioactive waste responsible for its disposal , subject to requirements of its Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority and an absolute veto given to local governments in which a proposed repository would be located . Producers of nuclear waste organized the company <unk> , with responsibility for site selection , construction and operation of a permanent repository . A 1994 amendment to the Act required final disposal of spent fuel in Finland , prohibiting the import or export of radioactive waste . 
 Environmental assessment of four sites occurred in 1997 – 98 , <unk> chose the <unk> site near two existing reactors , and the local government approved it in 2000 . The Finnish Parliament approved a deep geologic repository there in igneous bedrock at a depth of about 500 meters in 2001 . The repository concept is similar to the Swedish model , with containers to be clad in copper and buried below the water table beginning in 2020 . An underground characterization facility , <unk> spent nuclear fuel repository , was under construction at the site in 2012 . 
 = = = = France = = = = 
 With 58 nuclear reactors contributing about 75 % of its electricity , the highest percentage of any country , France has been reprocessing its spent reactor fuel since the introduction of nuclear power there . Some reprocessed plutonium is used to make fuel , but more is being produced than is being recycled as reactor fuel . France also reprocesses spent fuel for other countries , but the nuclear waste is returned to the country of origin . Radioactive waste from reprocessing French spent fuel is expected to be disposed of in a geological repository , pursuant to legislation enacted in 1991 that established a 15 @-@ year period for conducting radioactive waste management research . Under this legislation , partition and transmutation of long @-@ lived elements , immobilization and conditioning processes , and long @-@ term near surface storage are being investigated by the Commissariat à l ’ Energie <unk> ( CEA ) . Disposal in deep geological formations is being studied by the French agency for radioactive waste management , L <unk> Nationale pour la Gestion des <unk> <unk> , in underground research labs . 
 Three sites were identified for possible deep geologic disposal in clay near the border of Meuse and Haute @-@ Marne , near Gard , and at Vienne . In 1998 the government approved the Meuse / Haute Marne Underground Research Laboratory , a site near Meuse / Haute @-@ Marne and dropped the others from further consideration . Legislation was proposed in 2006 to license a repository by 2015 , with operations expected in 2025 . 
 = = = = Germany = = = = 
 Nuclear waste policy in Germany is in flux . German planning for a permanent geologic repository began in 1974 , focused on salt dome Gorleben , a salt mine near Gorleben about 100 kilometers northeast of Braunschweig . The site was announced in 1977 with plans for a reprocessing plant , spent fuel management , and permanent disposal facilities at a single site . Plans for the reprocessing plant were dropped in 1979 . In 2000 , the federal government and utilities agreed to suspend underground investigations for three to ten years , and the government committed to ending its use of nuclear power , closing one reactor in 2003 . 
 Within days of the March 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster , Chancellor Angela Merkel " imposed a three @-@ month moratorium on previously announced extensions for Germany 's existing nuclear power plants , while shutting seven of the 17 reactors that had been operating since 1981 " . Protests continued and , on 29 May 2011 , Merkel 's government announced that it would close all of its nuclear power plants by 2022 . 
 Meanwhile , electric utilities have been transporting spent fuel to interim storage facilities at Gorleben , <unk> and <unk> until temporary storage facilities can be built near reactor sites . Previously , spent fuel was sent to France or the United Kingdom for reprocessing , but this practice was ended in July 2005 . 
 = = = = Russia = = = = 
 In Russia , the Ministry of Atomic Energy ( <unk> ) is responsible for 31 nuclear reactors which generate about 16 % of its electricity . <unk> is also responsible for reprocessing and radioactive waste disposal , including over 25 @,@ 000 tons of spent nuclear fuel in temporary storage in 2001 . 
 Russia has a long history of reprocessing spent fuel for military purposes , and previously planned to reprocess imported spent fuel , possibly including some of the 33 @,@ 000 metric tons of spent fuel accumulated at sites in other countries who received fuel from the U.S. , which the U.S. originally pledged to take back , such as Brazil , the Czech Republic , India , Japan , Mexico , Slovenia , South Korea , Switzerland , Taiwan , and the European Union . 
 An Environmental Protection Act in 1991 prohibited importing radioactive material for long @-@ term storage or burial in Russia , but controversial legislation to allow imports for permanent storage was passed by the Russian Parliament and signed by President Putin in 2001 . In the long term , the Russian plan is for deep geologic disposal . Most attention has been paid to locations where waste has accumulated in temporary storage at <unk> , near Chelyabinsk in the Ural Mountains , and in granite at Krasnoyarsk in Siberia . 
 = = = = Sweden = = = = 
 In Sweden , as of 2007 there are ten operating nuclear reactors that produce about 45 % of its electricity . Two other reactors in <unk> were shut down in 1999 and 2005 . When these reactors were built , it was expected their nuclear fuel would be reprocessed in a foreign country , and the reprocessing waste would not be returned to Sweden . Later , construction of a domestic reprocessing plant was contemplated , but has not been built . 
 Passage of the <unk> Act of 1977 transferred responsibility for nuclear waste management from the government to the nuclear industry , requiring reactor operators to present an acceptable plan for waste management with " absolute safety " in order to obtain an operating license . In early 1980 , after the Three Mile Island meltdown in the United States , a referendum was held on the future use of nuclear power in Sweden . In late 1980 , after a three @-@ question referendum produced mixed results , the Swedish Parliament decided to phase out existing reactors by 2010 . In 2010 , the Swedish government opened up for construction of new nuclear reactors . The new units can only be built at the existing nuclear power sites , Oskarshamn , <unk> or <unk> , and only to replace one of the existing reactors , that will have to be shut down for the new one to be able to start up . 
 The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company . ( Svensk <unk> AB , known as SKB ) was created in 1980 and is responsible for final disposal of nuclear waste there . This includes operation of a monitored <unk> storage facility , the Central Interim Storage Facility for Spent Nuclear Fuel at Oskarshamn , about 150 miles south of Stockholm on the Baltic coast ; transportation of spent fuel ; and construction of a permanent repository . Swedish utilities store spent fuel at the reactor site for one year before transporting it to the facility at Oskarshamn , where it will be stored in excavated caverns filled with water for about 30 years before removal to a permanent repository . 
 Conceptual design of a permanent repository was determined by 1983 , calling for placement of copper @-@ clad iron canisters in granite bedrock about 500 metres underground , below the water table in what is known as the KBS @-@ 3 method . Space around the canisters will be filled with bentonite clay . After examining six possible locations for a permanent repository , three were nominated for further investigation , at <unk> , Oskarshamn , and <unk> . On 3 June 2009 , Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Co. chose a location for a deep @-@ level waste site at <unk> , near <unk> Nuclear Power plant . The application to build the repository was handed in by SKB 2011 . 
 = = = = Switzerland = = = = 
 Switzerland has five nuclear reactors that provide about 43 % of its electricity . Some Swiss spent nuclear fuel has been sent for reprocessing in France and the United Kingdom ; most fuel is being stored without reprocessing . An industry @-@ owned organization , <unk> , built and operates a central interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel and high @-@ level radioactive waste , and for conditioning low @-@ level radioactive waste and for incinerating wastes . Other interim storage facilities predating <unk> continue to operate in Switzerland . 
 The Swiss program is considering options for the siting of a deep repository for high @-@ level radioactive waste disposal , and for low & intermediate level wastes . Construction of a repository is not foreseen until well into this century . Research on sedimentary rock ( especially <unk> Clay ) is carried out at the Swiss Mont Terri rock laboratory ; the <unk> Test Site , an older facility in crystalline rock is also still active . 
 = = = = United Kingdom = = = = 
 Great Britain has 19 operating reactors , producing about 20 % of its electricity . It processes much of its spent fuel at Sellafield on the northwest coast across from Ireland , where nuclear waste is vitrified and sealed in stainless steel canisters for dry storage above ground for at least 50 years before eventual deep geologic disposal . Sellafield has a history of environmental and safety problems , including a fire in a nuclear plant in Windscale , and a significant incident in 2005 at the main reprocessing plant ( <unk> ) . 
 In 1982 the Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Management Executive ( <unk> ) was established with responsibility for disposing of long @-@ lived nuclear waste and in 2006 a Committee on Radioactive Waste Management ( <unk> ) of the Department of Environment , Food and Rural Affairs recommended geologic disposal 200 – 1 @,@ 000 meters underground . <unk> developed a generic repository concept based on the Swedish model but has not yet selected a site . A Nuclear Decommissioning Authority is responsible for packaging waste from reprocessing and will eventually relieve British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. of responsibility for power reactors and the Sellafield reprocessing plant .

 = = = = Canada = = = = 
 The 18 operating nuclear power plants in Canada generated about 16 % of its electricity in 2006 . A national Nuclear Fuel Waste Act was enacted by the Canadian Parliament in 2002 , requiring nuclear energy corporations to create a waste management organization to propose to the Government of Canada approaches for management of nuclear waste , and implementation of an approach subsequently selected by the government . The Act defined management as " long term management by means of storage or disposal , including handling , treatment , conditioning or transport for the purpose of storage or disposal . " 
 The resulting Nuclear Waste Management Organization ( NWMO ) conducted an extensive three @-@ year study and consultation with Canadians . In 2005 , they recommended Adaptive <unk> Management , an approach that emphasized both technical and management methods . The technical method included centralized isolation and containment of spent nuclear fuel in a deep geologic repository in a suitable rock formation , such as the granite of the Canadian Shield or Ordovician sedimentary rocks . Also recommended was a phased decision making process supported by a program of continuous learning , research and development . 
 In 2007 , the Canadian government accepted this recommendation , and NWMO was tasked with implementing the recommendation . No specific timeframe was defined for the process . In 2009 , the NWMO was designing the process for site selection ; siting was expected to take 10 years or more .

 The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established a timetable and procedure for constructing a permanent , underground repository for high @-@ level radioactive waste by the mid @-@ 1990s , and provided for some temporary storage of waste , including spent fuel from 104 civilian nuclear reactors that produce about 19 @.@ 4 % of electricity there . The United States in April 2008 had about 56 @,@ 000 metric tons of spent fuel and 20 @,@ 000 canisters of solid defense @-@ related waste , and this is expected to increase to 119 @,@ 000 metric tons by 2035 . The U.S. opted for Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository , a final repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada , but this project was widely opposed , with some of the main concerns being long distance transportation of waste from across the United States to this site , the possibility of accidents , and the uncertainty of success in isolating nuclear waste from the human environment in perpetuity . Yucca Mountain , with capacity for 70 @,@ 000 metric tons of radioactive waste , was expected to open in 2017 . However , the Obama Administration rejected use of the site in the 2009 United States Federal Budget proposal , which eliminated all funding except that needed to answer inquiries from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , " while the Administration devises a new strategy toward nuclear waste disposal . " On March 5 , 2009 , Energy Secretary Steven Chu told a Senate hearing " the Yucca Mountain site no longer was viewed as an option for storing reactor waste . " Starting in 1999 , military @-@ generated nuclear waste is being entombed at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico . 
 In a Presidential Memorandum dated January 29 , 2010 , President Obama established the Blue Ribbon Commission on America ’ s Nuclear Future ( the Commission ) . The Commission , composed of fifteen members , conducted an extensive two @-@ year study of nuclear waste disposal , what is referred to as the " back end " of the nuclear energy process . The Commission established three subcommittees : Reactor and Fuel Cycle Technology , Transportation and Storage , and Disposal . On January 26 , 2012 , the Commission submitted its final report to Energy Secretary Steven Chu . In the Disposal Subcommittee ’ s final report the Commission does not issue recommendations for a specific site but rather presents a comprehensive recommendation for disposal strategies . During their research the Commission visited Finland , France , Japan , Russia , Sweden , and the UK . In their final report the Commission put forth seven recommendations for developing a comprehensive strategy to pursue : 
 Recommendation # 1 
 The United States should undertake an integrated nuclear waste management program that leads to the timely development of one or more permanent deep geological facilities for the safe disposal of spent fuel and high @-@ level nuclear waste . 
 Recommendation # 2 
 A new , single @-@ purpose organization is needed to develop and implement a focused , integrated program for the transportation , storage , and disposal 1 of nuclear waste in the United States . 
 Recommendation # 3 
 Assured access to the balance in the Nuclear Waste Fund ( NWF ) and to the revenues generated by annual nuclear waste fee payments from utility ratepayers is absolutely essential and must be provided to the new nuclear waste management organization . 
 Recommendation # 4 
 A new approach is needed to site and develop nuclear waste facilities in the United States in the future . We believe that these processes are most likely to succeed if they are : 
 Adaptive — in the sense that process itself is flexible and produces decisions that are responsive to new information and new technical , social , or political developments . 
 Staged — in the sense that key decisions are revisited and modified as necessary along the way rather than being pre @-@ determined in advance . 
 Consent @-@ based — in the sense that affected communities have an opportunity to decide whether to accept facility siting decisions and retain significant local control . 
 Transparent — in the sense that all stakeholders have an opportunity to understand key decisions and engage in the process in a meaningful way . 
 <unk> and science @-@ based — in the sense that the public can have confidence that all facilities meet rigorous , objective , and consistently @-@ applied standards of safety and environmental protection . 
 Governed by partnership arrangements or legally @-@ enforceable agreements with host states , tribes and local communities . 
 Recommendation # 5 
 The current division of regulatory responsibilities for long @-@ term repository performance between the NRC and the EPA is appropriate and should continue . The two agencies should develop new , site @-@ independent safety standards in a formally coordinated joint process that actively engages and solicits input from all the relevant constituencies . 
 Recommendation # 6 
 The roles , responsibilities , and authorities of local , state , and tribal governments ( with respect to facility siting and other aspects of nuclear waste disposal ) must be an element of the negotiation between the federal government and the other affected units of government in establishing a disposal facility . In addition to legally @-@ binding agreements , as discussed in Recommendation # 4 , all affected levels of government ( local , state , tribal , etc . ) must have , at a minimum , a meaningful consultative role in all other important decisions . Additionally , states and tribes should retain — or where appropriate , be delegated — direct authority over aspects of regulation , permitting , and operations where oversight below the federal level can be exercised effectively and in a way that is helpful in protecting the interests and gaining the confidence of affected communities and citizens . 
 Recommendation # 7 
 The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board ( <unk> ) should be retained as a valuable source of independent technical advice and review . 
 = = = International repository = = = 
 Although Australia does not have any nuclear power reactors , Pangea Resources considered siting an international repository in the outback of South Australia or Western Australia in 1998 , but this stimulated legislative opposition in both states and the Australian national Senate during the following year . Thereafter , Pangea ceased operations in Australia but reemerged as Pangea International Association , and in 2002 evolved into the Association for Regional and International Underground Storage with support from Belgium , Bulgaria , Hungary , Japan and Switzerland . A general concept for an international repository has been advanced by one of the principals in all three ventures . Russia has expressed interest in serving as a repository for other countries , but does not envision sponsorship or control by an international body or group of other countries . South Africa , Argentina and western China have also been mentioned as possible locations . 
 In the EU , <unk> is negotiating a European @-@ wide waste disposal system with single disposal sites that can be used by several EU @-@ countries . This EU @-@ wide storage possibility is being researched under the <unk> @-@ 2 program .

 Ezra Ray Johnson ( born October 2 , 1955 in Shreveport , Louisiana ) is a retired American football defensive end who played for the Green Bay Packers , Indianapolis Colts and Houston Oilers in a fifteen @-@ year career that lasted from 1977 to 1991 in the National Football League ( NFL ) . 
 A first @-@ round pick from Morris Brown College by the Green Bay Packers in 1977 , Johnson was known as one of the best defensive linemen in his first few years in the league . Johnson earned a spot in the 1979 Pro Bowl after unofficially finishing second , to Detroit Lions Al " Bubba " Baker , with 20 @.@ 5 sacks in 1978 . ( Quarterback sacks were not an official NFL statistic until 1982 . ) However by 1981 , Johnson 's career was marred by a series of back injuries and allegations of his lack of discipline on the field , including one incident in which he ate a hot dog while sitting on the bench during a preseason game , and being inconsistent at times . He lost and regained his starting job multiple times during that period . 
 Johnson was exclusively used as the third @-@ down pass rush specialist after 1986 , and took a leadership role with the team . He was released by the Packers in 1988 and played with two seasons with the Colts , and one with the Oilers before retiring in 1991 . Despite his adverse relationship with the team at times , Johnson was elected to the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1997 . 
 = = College career = = 
 Johnson played college football at Morris Brown College in Atlanta , Georgia . In his last year at Morris Brown he had 112 tackles and 28 sacks . However his size and the small school he played for helped lower his draft stock . He was projected to go anywhere from the first to fourth rounds prior to the NFL Draft .

 Johnson was drafted as the 28th pick of the first round in the 1977 NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers . Johnson was considered a " gamble pick " for the Packers because of lack of major college experience and his relatively small size for a defensive end . In his rookie season , Johnson appeared in 14 games as the backup for Alden Roche at defensive end . Johnson significantly improved in his second year , becoming one of the top defensive ends in the league with his size and speed , a 4 @.@ 5 in the 40 @-@ yard dash , being the main factors for his success . He thrived on the Packers 4 – 3 defense , and recorded 14 sacks by the eighth game of the season . Johnson had two sacks and forced two fumbles in a 45 – 28 win against the Seattle Seahawks on October 16 , 1978 . At that time , the Packers had the best record in the NFC Central at 6 – 1 . By the end of the year , Johnson recorded an unofficial 20 @.@ 5 sacks , a statistic used , but not kept , by the NFL until 1982 . However , the Packers offense were among the worst in the league , and the team lost a chance for a playoff berth in the final game of the season against the Los Angeles Rams . Johnson was rewarded for his efforts by being selected to play in the Pro Bowl and was rewarded with the Packers Defensive Player of the Year award . 
 In 1979 , Johnson missed seven games early in the season because of a sprained left ankle . On his return against the Minnesota Vikings on November 11 , he sacked quarterback Tommy Kramer four times in a 19 – 7 win . During that period , Johnson teamed up with fellow first @-@ round pick Mike Butler to form one of the league 's most potent defensive lineups . Nicknamed the " Gang Green " , they became known for their ability to pressure the quarterback to force a sack . 
 Prior to the start to the 1980 season , Johnson was notoriously fined $ 1 @,@ 000 and required by then @-@ general manager @-@ head coach Bart Starr to apologize for eating a hot dog on the sidelines during the fourth quarter of a 38 – 0 Packers ' home preseason loss to the Denver Broncos on August 30 , 1980 . Starr gave Johnson back the $ 1 @,@ 000 at the end of the year . However , defensive line coach Fred von <unk> resigned five days after the incident because Starr refused to suspend Johnson . He started in all 15 games that season , as the Packers finished with a 5 – 10 – 1 record . After the season , Johnson and Butler were both criticized for not playing up to the Packers expectations when they drafted them . One journalist stated that their development was halted because of a lack of stability in the Green Bay coaching situation , who went though four defensive line coaches in three years . 
 In 1981 , Johnson lost his starting role to Casey Merrill as the Packers had changed to a 3 – 4 defensive scheme , and decided instead to use Johnson exclusively for pass rushing situations . It was a decision which confused the local media as Johnson had been the starter since 1978 . Merrill , who was released by the Cincinnati Bengals and claimed off waivers by the Packers , was considered by the team as the better , more consistent interior lineman against the run . The Packers claimed Johnson lost his job because of his lack of " size " and low upside . However , during the preseason , many people within the Packers organization " questioned " Johnson 's desire to play and his attitude , an allegation Johnson quickly denied . He also was fined by Starr an unknown amount of money for almost missing a team flight to New York after celebrating his birthday the previous night , misplacing his car keys . He only started three games that season . 
 By 1982 , Johnson regained his starting job over Merrill . Defensive coordinator John Meyer stated that Johnson was " playing his best football " since his breakout 1978 season . Johnson stated that " eating his mother 's cooking " and being " healthy " were the main reasons for his improvement . He signed a three @-@ year contract with the Packers at $ 450 @,@ 000 a year . It led to a lawsuit against his former agency <unk> Sports Servicing , who claimed that he never gave the agency their commission . He had an official career best of 14 @.@ 5 quarterback sacks in 1983 along with 107 tackles , a team record by a defensive lineman in a single season . 
 The success didn 't last long , as Johnson started to get hampered with back injuries , which reduced his effectiveness . In 1984 , Johnson had surgery for a herniated disk , an injury he suffered during training camp , and was known as a potential career @-@ ending injury . He missed the first game of the regular season against the St. Louis Cardinals and could not fully recover from the injury . Again he lost his starting job , becoming a third @-@ down pass @-@ rushing specialist , and was credited with seven sacks for the year ; the injury forced Johnson to mull retirement . 
 Prior to the start of training camp for the 1985 season , Johnson had a second surgery to repair his herniated disk . At the same time , Johnson took on a leadership role for the Green Bay defense , and started to accept his role as a backup and started to mentor the younger players . After injuries befell the Packers ' defensive line , Johnson regained his starting position at defensive end . He started all 16 games that year , achieving 9 @.@ 5 sacks . His career started to diminish after that season . In 1986 , Johnson was credited with three and a half sacks as he was used as the designated third @-@ down pass rushing specialist . He injured his right knee in 1987 , missing 10 of the first 11 games of the season . He was released by the Packers on January 8 , 1988 . At the time of his release , Johnson was the Packers ' all @-@ time leader in sacks with 84 . 
 = = = Indianapolis and Houston = = = 
 Johnson signed with the Indianapolis Colts in 1988 in order to provide experience to a young and inexperienced Colts squad . During his time with the Colts , Johnson was used as a part @-@ time starter in a role similar to his final few years with the Packers . He played in ten games that year , recording three sacks and played in all 16 games the following year , recording 8 @.@ 5 sacks . He joined the Houston Oilers in 1990 , where he played in all 16 games , starting three , and was credited with 2 @.@ 5 sacks . After playing two games for the Oilers in 1991 , Johnson retired . 
 He played in 192 games in his career , having officially 55 @.@ 5 quarterback sacks ( 99 when his unofficial totals are added ) .

 " Army of Ghosts " is the twelfth and penultimate episode in the second series of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who which was first broadcast on 1 July 2006 . It is the first episode of a two @-@ part story ; the concluding episode , " Doomsday " , was first broadcast on 8 July . 
 The episode takes place on contemporary Earth , some time after the Doctor 's and Rose 's last visit to Earth in " Love & Monsters " . During this time , the public have become accustomed to intermittent appearances of ghosts . The Doctor tracks the source of the ghosts to the Torchwood Institute , where the Doctor learns of the Cybermen from " Rise of the Cybermen " and " The Age of Steel " crossing a breach in the Void created by a Dalek @-@ piloted Void ship . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The episode begins with a cold open in which Rose , via narration , recollects her life with the Doctor and her belief that they would always be travelling together . She then mentions that this episode is " the story of how I died " . 
 Rose Tyler and the Doctor decide to visit Rose 's mother Jackie . Jackie is pleased to see them , but makes a strangely happy remark that her deceased father will be joining them shortly . Despite Rose 's protestations that her grandfather is dead , Jackie insists that he has returned and has been visiting her for some time . A vaguely humanoid and luminous silhouette appears in the flat , surprising both the Doctor and Rose but delighting Jackie before disappearing . TV broadcasts confirm that this is a worldwide phenomenon and Jackie explains that a few months previously millions of ghosts began appearing all over the world . Humans have come to accept them and believe that they are the manifestations of loved ones . 
 The Doctor dismisses the possibility that these are ghosts and conducts an experiment with the help of the TARDIS . He attempts to trap a ghost and determines that they are not ghosts but are impressions of something forcing its way into this universe . The Doctor tracks the signal back and uses the TARDIS to travel there , arriving at the Torchwood Institute . The Doctor introduces himself and tells everyone that Jackie is Rose , his companion . They are taken by soldiers to see Torchwood 's current director Yvonne Hartman , while the TARDIS is impounded with Rose inside . Ms. Hartman shows the Doctor the source of the ghost energy , an invisible breach in the universe through which a mysterious spherical object has arrived . The Doctor inspects the sphere , declaring it to be a " Void ship " — which , according to him , is impossible . It is designed to exist in the space between universes , a nothingness called the Void . The ship is completely undetectable by all scientific instruments . Torchwood has no explanation for the sphere is or how it got there , but they claim responsibility for the ghosts . Torchwood has been conducting experiments on the breach , forcing it open in an attempt to harness it as a source of energy . Ms. Hartman also reveals to the Doctor that his encounter with Queen Victoria in " Tooth and Claw " made him an enemy of the state and was the catalyst for the creation of Torchwood . Unbeknownst to all at this point , an unseen party has infiltrated the institute and has been successful in subverting three Torchwood staff . 
 Meanwhile , Rose slips out of the TARDIS and uses a lab coat she found to masquerade as an employee to explore Torchwood . She gains access to the sphere chamber with the Doctor 's psychic paper , but is detained by a Dr. Singh . He discovers that Rose is an imposter and informs Ms. Hartman of her presence . Dr. Singh then asks his colleague Samuel , whom Rose recognises as Mickey Smith , to seal the doors . Ms. Hartman questions the Doctor , who admits that the woman in the sphere chamber is really Rose and that the woman with him in her office is Rose 's mum Jackie . In the command centre , the three employees under manipulation initiate an unscheduled ghost shift and forcibly open the breach . The extended shift causes millions of ghosts to appear across the globe before they materialise into their true form , the Cybermen . At the same time the Cybermen arrive the Void ship suddenly activates and begins to open . The Cybermen take control of Torchwood and order the complete surrender of humanity for conversion . The Doctor , puzzled at how the Cybermen could have created an advanced piece of technology like the Void ship , asks the Cyber Leader how they were able to build it . The Cyber Leader responds that the Cybermen are similarly oblivious to the origins of the sphere and that they merely followed its course through the breach . 
 In the sphere chamber , Mickey explains to Rose that after a battle in the parallel universe the Cybermen mysteriously disappeared . He happened upon their means of escape and returned to his native universe with the intention of stopping them . Mickey believes that the Cybermen are in control of the sphere and produces a gun to destroy whatever is in it . Rose is horrified when the sphere opens and reveals its occupants to be a quartet of Daleks , who identify their location as Earth and begin chanting , " Exterminate ! Exterminate ! " .
