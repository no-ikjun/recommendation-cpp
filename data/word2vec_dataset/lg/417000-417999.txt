 = = Etymology and taxonomy = = 
 The name " gastrotrich " comes from the Greek <unk> gaster , meaning " stomach " , and <unk> <unk> , meaning " hair " . The name was coined by the Russian zoologist Élie Metchnikoff in 1865 . The common name " <unk> " apparently arises from a mistranslation of " gastrotrich " . 
 The relationship of gastrotrichs to other phyla is unclear . Morphology suggests that they are close to the Gnathostomulida , the Rotifera , or the Nematoda . On the other hand , genetic studies place them as close relatives of the Platyhelminthes , the Ecdysozoa or the Lophotrochozoa . As of 2011 , around 790 species have been described . The phylum contains a single class , divided into two orders : the Macrodasyida and the Chaetonotida . Edward Ruppert et al. report that the Macrodasyida are wholly marine , but two rare and poorly known species , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , are known from fresh water . The Chaetonotida comprises both marine and freshwater species . 
 = = Anatomy = = 
 Gastrotrichs vary in size from about 0 @.@ 06 to 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 002 to 0 @.@ 118 in ) in body length . They are bilaterally symmetrical , with a transparent strap @-@ shaped or bowling pin @-@ shaped body , arched dorsally and flattened ventrally . The anterior end is not clearly defined as a head but contains the sense organs , brain and pharynx . <unk> are found around the mouth and on the ventral surface of the head and body . The trunk contains the gut and the reproductive organs . At the posterior end of the body are two projections with cement glands that serve in adhesion . This is a double @-@ gland system where one gland secretes the glue and another secretes a de @-@ adhesive agent to sever the connection . In the Macrodasyida , there are additional adhesive glands at the anterior end and on the sides of the body . 
 The body wall consists of a cuticle , an epidermis and longitudinal and circular bands of muscle fibres . In some primitive species , each epidermal cell has a single cilium , a feature shared only by the <unk> . The whole ventral surface of the animal may be ciliated or the cilia may be arranged in rows , patches or transverse bands . The cuticle is locally thickened in some gastrotrichs and forms scales , hooks and spines . There is no coelom ( body cavity ) and the interior of the animal is filled with poorly differentiated connective tissue . In the macrodasyidans , Y @-@ shaped cells , each containing a vacuole , surround the gut and may function as a hydrostatic skeleton . 
 The mouth is at the anterior end , and opens into an elongated muscular pharynx with a triangular or Y @-@ shaped lumen , lined by myoepithelial cells . The pharynx opens into a cylindrical intestine , which is lined with glandular and digestive cells . The anus is located on the ventral surface close to the posterior of the body . In some species , there are pores in the pharynx opening to the ventral surface ; these contain valves and may allow <unk> of any excess water swallowed while feeding . 
 In the <unk> , the excretory system consists of a single pair of protonephridia , which open through separate pores on the lateral underside of the animal , usually in the midsection of the body . In the macrodasyidans , there are several pairs of these opening along the side of the body . Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall , as part of respiration , and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in osmoregulation . Unusually , the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells , but , instead , the excretory cells consist of a skirt surrounding a series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central flagellum . These cells , termed <unk> , connect to a single outlet cell which passes the excreted material into the <unk> duct . 
 As is typical for such small animals , there are no respiratory or circulatory organs . The nervous system is relatively simple . The brain consists of two ganglia , one on either side of the pharynx , connected by a <unk> . From these lead a pair of nerve cords which run along either side of the body beside the longitudinal muscle bands . The primary sensory organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface which function as mechanoreceptors . There are also ciliated pits on the head , simple ciliary photoreceptors and fleshy appendages which act as chemoreceptors . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Gastrotrichs are cosmopolitan in distribution . They inhabit the interstitial spaces between particles in marine and freshwater environments , the surfaces of aquatic plants and other submerged objects and the surface film of water surrounding soil particles on land . They are also found in stagnant pools and anaerobic mud , where they thrive even in the presence of hydrogen sulphide . When pools dry up they can survive periods of desiccation as eggs , and some species are capable of forming cysts in harsh conditions . In marine sediments they have been known to reach 364 individuals per 10 cm2 ( 1 @.@ 6 sq in ) making them the third most common invertebrate in the sediment after nematodes and <unk> copepods . In freshwater they may reach a density of 158 individuals per 10 cm2 ( 1 @.@ 6 sq in ) and are the fifth most abundant group of invertebrates in the sediment . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 In marine and freshwater environments , gastrotrichs form part of the benthic community . They are detritivores and are <unk> , sucking dead or living organic material , diatoms , bacteria and small protozoa into their mouths by the muscular action of the pharynx . They are themselves eaten by turbellarians and other small <unk> . 
 Like many microscopic animals , gastrotrich locomotion is primarily powered by hydrostatics , but movement occurs through different methods in different members of the group . <unk> only have adhesive glands at the back and , in them , locomotion typically proceeds in a smooth gliding manner ; the whole body is propelled forward by the rhythmic action of the cilia on the ventral surface . In the pelagic <unk> genus <unk> , however , movement proceeds in jerks as the long , muscle @-@ activated spines are forced rhythmically towards the side of the body . By contrast , with <unk> , macrodasyidans typically have multiple adhesive glands and move forward with a creeping action similar to that of a " <unk> " caterpillar . In response to a threat , the head and trunk can be rapidly pulled backwards , or the creeping movement can be reversed . Muscular action is important when the animal turns sideways and during copulation , when two individuals twine around each other . 
 = = Reproduction and lifespan = = 
 <unk> reproduction and reproductive behaviour has been little studied . That of <unk> probably most represents that of the ancestral lineage and these more primitive gastrotrichs are simultaneous hermaphrodites , possessing both male and female sex organs . There is generally a single pair of gonads , the anterior portion of which contains sperm @-@ producing cells and the posterior portion producing ova . The sperm is sometimes packaged in spermatophores , and is released through male gonopores that open , often temporarily , on the underside of the animal , roughly two @-@ thirds of the way along the body . A copulatory organ on the tail collects the sperm and transfers it to the partner 's seminal receptacle through the female gonopore . Details of the process and the behaviour involved vary with the species , and there are a range of different accessory reproductive organs . During copulation , the " male " individual uses his copulatory organ to transfer sperm to his partner 's gonopore and fertilisation is internal . The fertilised eggs are released by rupture of the body wall which afterwards repairs itself . As is the case in most protostomes , development of the embryo is determinate , with each cell destined to become a specific part of the animal 's body . At least one species of gastrotrich , <unk> <unk> , is viviparous . 
 Many species of <unk> gastrotrichs reproduce entirely by parthenogenesis . In these species , the male portions of the reproductive system are degenerate and non @-@ functional , or , in many cases , entirely absent . Though the eggs have a diameter of less than 50 µm , they are still very large in comparison with the animals ' size . Some species are capable of laying eggs that remain dormant during times of desiccation or low temperatures ; these species , however , are also able to produce regular eggs , which hatch in one to four days , when environmental conditions are more favourable . The eggs of all gastrotrichs undergo direct development and hatch into miniature versions of the adult . The young typically reach sexual maturity in about three days . In the laboratory , <unk> <unk> has lived for up to forty days , producing four or five eggs during the first ten days of life . 
 Gastrotrichs demonstrate <unk> , each species having an invariant genetically fixed number of cells as adults . Cell division ceases at the end of embryonic development and further growth is solely due to cell enlargement .

 " The Căluşari " is the twenty @-@ first episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It originally aired on the Fox network on April 14 , 1995 . It was written by Sara B. Charno and directed by Michael Vejar . " The Căluşari " is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology , or fictional history . It earned a Nielsen household rating of 8 @.@ 3 , being watched by 7 @.@ 9 million households in its initial broadcast . Due to perceived inconsistencies in the plot , " The Căluşari " received mixed reviews from television critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In this episode , a photograph taken just before the death of a two @-@ year @-@ old boy yields evidence of some supernatural intervention which piques Mulder and Scully 's curiosity . When another death in the family occurs , the grandmother of the remaining child requests the aid of some Romanian ritualists , named the Calusari , in order to cleanse the home of evil . 
 The script for " The Căluşari " was inspired by Charno 's experience as a doctor of Eastern medicine . The inspiration for the entry came from an idea series creator Chris Carter had involving someone getting hanged with a garage @-@ door opener . Because " The Căluşari " was heavy in terms of violence , Fox 's standards and practices department took issues with several scenes . In addition , Carter re @-@ cut the episode after it was completed in order to make it scarier .

 In Murray , Virginia , the Holvey family visits a local amusement park . When the youngest child , Teddy , lets his balloon fly away , his father , Steve , gives him the balloon that belongs to his older brother , Charlie ( Joel Palmer ) . When the boys ' mother , Maggie ( Helene Clarkson ) , is in the bathroom , the strap in Teddy 's stroller comes undone . Teddy follows the balloon floating under its own power out of the restroom and onto the tracks of the park 's tour train , leading to him getting killed by the train . Charlie is the only member of the Holvey family not to grieve Teddy 's death at the scene . 
 Three months later , Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) shows Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) a photo taken moments before Teddy 's death , showing that the balloon moved horizontally against the wind . Chuck Burks ( Bill Dow ) , a digital photo expert , uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances in the shape of a child , holding the balloon . During a visit by the agents , the <unk> adamantly dispute Mulder 's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks . Scully sees Golda ( <unk> Chauvin ) , Maggie 's elderly Romanian mother , drawing a swastika on Charlie ’ s hand . Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey children may be victims of Munchausen by proxy , perpetrated by their grandmother . At a meeting with Steve Holvey , he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie , and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family . Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie , leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff ( Christine Willes ) . While preparing to take Charlie to a session with Kosseff , Steve 's tie is caught in the seemingly @-@ malfunctioning garage door , strangling and hanging him . Charlie , having been mysteriously locked in the car , starts crying over his father 's death . 
 Investigating Steve 's death , the police find evidence of the ritualistic sacrifices in Golda 's room . Mulder finds a film of fine dust in the garage , which Chuck identifies it as <unk> , a residual sign of spiritual energy . Golda and three elderly Căluşari mystics conduct a ritual in her room . Meanwhile , during Charlie 's appointment with Kosseff , the child goes into convulsions . Kosseff and Maggie see smoke coming from under Golda 's door , coming across their ritual . Maggie is horrified , and forces the old men to leave the house . However , Golda grabs Charlie and pulls him into her room in an attempt to complete the ritual . However , Charlie quickly gains the upper hand and brings a pair of dead chickens back to life and makes them kill her . 
 When Kosseff asks Charlie about the incident , he insists that he was not in his grandmother 's room , and that it was a boy named Michael . Maggie is terrified at the claim , explaining to the agents that Michael was Charlie ’ s stillborn twin , about whom she and Steve agreed to never tell Charlie . Maggie also explains that Golda had told the parents that a ritual should be performed to separate the spirits of the twins , but Steve refused . Charlie has another seizure and is hospitalized . Michael knocks out the nurse and afterward convinces Maggie , by pretending to be Charlie , to take him home . Scully sees them leaving , and checks on Charlie . They find the nurse and Charlie still in the hospital room . Mulder , now convinced that Michael 's spirit is behind the killings , sends Scully to the Holvey residence to stop him . 
 Maggie tries to complete her mother 's ritual , but Michael tries to intervene . Back at the hospital , Mulder joins the Căluşari as they perform an exorcism on Charlie . As Mulder helps with the ritual , Scully arrives at the Holvey house , and finds Maggie being attacked by Michael . Scully is tossed across the room by an unseen force . Just as Michael is about to stab Scully , the exorcism ends , and Michael 's spirit disappears , sparing both Scully and Maggie 's lives . Maggie returns to the hospital and is reunited with Charlie . Before the agents leave , the head elder of the Căluşari says it 's over for the time being and cautiously <unk> Mulder that " it knows you . "

 The episode was written by Sara Charno and directed by Mike Vejar . Before becoming a writer , Charno had been a doctor of Eastern medicine . According to writer Frank Spotnitz , her " esoteric knowledge that none of the rest of [ the writers ] had about all kinds of things " was put to use in the script for " The Calusari " . The episode was based largely on an idea that series creator Chris Carter had ; his thought revolved around a " garage @-@ door opener hanging " . When Charlie stands over his grandmother and begins speaking in Romanian , he utters the words " You are too late to stop us . " Christine Willes , who plays the part of Agent Kosseff , reprises her role ; she originally appeared in the earlier episode " Irresistible " . 
 During production of the episode , the producers " agonized " over the teaser — due to the fact that it featured the death of a small child — as well as the darkness of the entire episode . Fox 's standards and practices department took issues with Steve 's strangulation scene ; in the end , the sequence was left in the episode , but Steve 's face was obscured to " soften the impact " . Although the episode 's filming went along smoothly , the final cut " didn 't pass muster " . Spotnitz explained that Carter " spent a lot of time in the editing room trying to figure out how to make this more terrifying . " Spotnitz later noted that Carter 's dedication impacted his work ethic and proved that something could be so " much better [ … ] if you didn 't give up . "

A total of 7 @.@ 9 million households watched this episode during its original airing . " The Calusari " is the only episode of the series to have received an explicit rating of " 18 " in the United Kingdom by the BBFC for " occasional strong horror " and themes involving " demonic possession " . 
 " The Calusari " received mixed reviews , with critics citing inconsistencies in the plot as the main detractions . Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a " B – " rating , calling it " an Exorcist / Omen rip @-@ off , but a classy one " . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave it a " C + " , writing that it was " an episode with a lot of great and spooky moments " , but " a messy , chaotic story that could have been much better developed , and too many things that happen [ ... ] just because the writers thought it would be cool if they happened " . However , while he was " not sure everything hangs together " and he wished for more backstory , VanDerWerff did praise some " really great moments " , particularly the opening teaser . John Keegan from Critical Myth , while calling the episode " a mixed bag " , awarded it a 7 out of 10 . He praised the entry 's " fascinating implications [ about ] the mythology hidden within the events depicted " , and noted that it was " well directed and acted " . Despite this , he was more critical of the episode 's plot and wrote that there were " clear logical flaws [ ... ] and the subject matter can be disturbing . This is an episode that falls heavily to subjective interpretation . " Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , gave the episode a largely negative review and rated it one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five . The two called it a " pale retread of The Exorcist " and noted that many of the episode 's elements , like the chicken @-@ sacrificing grandmother and the Calusari members , were " tremendously crass " . Shearman and Pearson , however , did enjoy the episode 's dialogue , praising one scene in particular where the spirit of Michael torments his mother by asking to be taken to the amusement park and ride the train that killed his younger brother . Regardless , however , the duo concluded that " there 's something stale and pointless at [ the episode 's ] heart . "

In this episode , Scully is kidnapped by an alien bounty hunter and Mulder offers his sister Samantha ( Leitch ) forward as ransom . However , Samantha is merely one of several clones created as part of a human @-@ alien hybrid project , leading Mulder to pursue the bounty hunter for the truth about her disappearance . " End Game " is a two @-@ part episode , continuing the plot from the previous episode , " Colony " . 
 " End Game " was the first episode of the series written by Spotnitz , who eventually went on to become one of the series ' executive producers .

 The USS Allegiance , an American nuclear submarine , is patrolling the Beaufort Sea off the coast of Alaska when it comes across a craft below the ice that is emitting a radio signal . The Allegiance is ordered to fire upon the craft by Pacific Command . However , the craft manages to disable the sub using a high @-@ pitched frequency , stranding it far below the ice . 
 Continuing from the cliffhanger ending in " Colony " , Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) is beaten and kidnapped by " Mulder " , who is really the Bounty Hunter in disguise . When the real Mulder ( David Duchovny ) finds the wrecked hotel room , his sister Samantha explains that the Bounty Hunter will set up a hostage exchange to swap Scully for her . She further explains that the Bounty Hunter can only be killed by piercing the base of his neck , and that his toxic alien blood is deadly to humans . Finally , Samantha reveals that the clones are the progeny of two original aliens , and worked at abortion clinics to gain access to fetal tissue . Their objective was to set up an extraterrestrial colony on Earth , an effort that has gone as far back as the 1940s . However , because the clones ' experiments were considered to have tainted their alien race , the Bounty Hunter was sent to kill them . 
 Walter Skinner meets Mulder and Samantha at Mulder 's apartment , telling them that the remaining clones are missing . Mulder receives a call from Scully , who tells him that the Bounty Hunter seeks an exchange for Samantha . Mulder and Samantha are sent to a bridge near Bethesda while Skinner hides nearby with a sharpshooter . After the exchange takes place , Samantha attacks the Bounty Hunter . During the struggle , the sharpshooter fires upon the Bounty Hunter , and both he and Samantha fall into a river . An anguished Mulder tearfully apologizes to his father , Bill , for losing her again . His father leaves him a note from Samantha , which provides Mulder with the address of a Maryland clinic where they can meet if separated . Mulder hopes that she is alive , but soon gets a call from Scully reporting that Samantha 's body has been found . After Scully ends the call , she discovers Samantha 's body dissolving into a green liquid . 
 Meanwhile , inside the clinic , Mulder finds multiple clones of Samantha working on fetuses in labs similar to that of the clones . They reveal that they manipulated Mulder by sending one of their own to pose as " Samantha " in an effort to have him protect her original clone . They also claim to know the real Samantha 's location . Mulder , realizing he has been duped , initially refuses to help and starts to leave , but is knocked unconscious by the arriving Bounty Hunter , who proceeds to kill the Samantha clones and burn down the clinic . When no trace of the clones are found , Mulder meets with X at the Kennedy Center , demanding to know the Bounty Hunter 's location . X says that the Bounty Hunter 's craft below the Beaufort Sea has been found , and that a naval fleet has been sent to destroy it . Mulder heads there , and e @-@ mails Scully to tell her not to follow him . 
 Scully goes to Skinner for help , but he initially refuses . Scully also summons X to Mulder 's apartment , but he turns her down . On his way out , X is confronted by Skinner in an elevator . After the two men get into a vicious physical altercation , X divulges Mulder 's whereabouts . Meanwhile , Mulder finds the stranded Allegiance , with its sail broken through a patch of shallow ice . Inside , he finds what seems to be the sub 's only surviving crewman , whom Mulder correctly guesses is the disguised Bounty Hunter . The two struggle , during which Mulder becomes exposed to the Bounty Hunter 's toxic blood . The Bounty Hunter claims that Samantha is still alive before dumping Mulder off the sail and submerging the Allegiance ; Mulder is nearly cut in half with the sub 's diving plane in the process . Mulder is discovered and rushed to the field hospital seen at the beginning of " Colony " , where Scully — having learned that the alien blood contains a retrovirus that dies in cold temperatures — convinces the doctors to take him out of the bath that would warm his body up . 
 As Mulder 's condition stabilizes , Scully writes a field report crediting science with detecting the retrovirus and saving Mulder . She contends that the retrovirus is of a mysterious origin , and reports that neither the Bounty Hunter nor the Allegiance have been found . When Mulder regains consciousness , he tells Scully that his experiences did not give him the answers he had been searching for , but that they have given him renewed " faith to keep looking " .

 This was the first episode of the series written by Frank Spotnitz . Spotnitz , who came up with the idea to bring back Samantha Mulder in " Colony " , wrote this episode , his first credited work on the show . According to Spotnitz , he along with Chris Carter , were overly ambitious when writing this episode . Since this was Spotnitz 's debut as a television writer , he got significant help from Carter to put the script together . All of the scenes originally pitched by Spotnitz were kept , except for a car chase scene that ended with a crash , and one where Mulder mistakes a federal marshal for the bounty hunter . The scenes were cut due to time restraints during filming . Spotnitz later became a frequent collaborator on many of the subsequent mythology episodes of the show , as well as co @-@ writing the two feature films . 
 It turned out in this episode that the Samantha Mulder ( Megan Leitch ) who appeared was a clone . Carter did not want it to be the real Samantha , since that would have been " straight science fiction " and it was too " ridiculous " to give too many answers . Spotnitz further explained that the production crew never saw The X @-@ Files as a " science fiction show " , but more of a show that incorporated science fiction , and that this and previous episode " Colony " were more of a " suspense thriller " than any other genre . Chris Carter described the " Colony " and " End Game " two @-@ parter as the " backbone of the show , the romantic quest of Mulder for the truth and Scully as well " , and that it led Scully to believe in the conspiracy . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The motel scene with the bounty hunter and Dana Scully was shot on a sound stage in Vancouver , Canada in a simple motel room set . The scene featuring Scully being beaten up by the bounty hunter was primarily performed by a stunt woman . The stiletto weapon , often referred to as the " gimlet " , used by the bounty hunter was constructed from aluminium and acrylic , and activated by a pneumatic hose hidden in actor Brian Thompson 's sleeve . The grunt Scully utters when thrown through a table was insisted on by Standards and Practices , giving the reasoning that the show needed to make it clear for the viewers that she was not dead . According to executive producer Frank Spotnitz it was an " arcane , bizarre logic that you have to deal with when you 're putting a show on network television . " As director Rob Bowman was dissatisfied with the first take of Skinner shoving X against the elevator wall , Mitch Pileggi and Steven Williams decided to do the stunt for real , and Pileggi did it with so much strength that it broke the back of the elevator scenery . Williams ' background in fight choreography , stemming from his role in Missing in Action 2 : The Beginning , allowed him to help in choreographing the brawl . 
 One hundred and forty tons of snow and ice were trucked into a soundstage to create the scene with the submarine towards the end of the episode , and the stage had to be refrigerated for five days . The control tower scenery was able to rise or lower only five feet , leading to restrictions such as filming on black backdrops . A decommissioned destroyer , Her Majesty 's Canadian Ship Mackenzie , was rented from the Royal Canadian Navy and used for the submarine interior . It was reused two episodes later for interior shots in " Død Kalm " .

" Chicago Tribune rock music critic Greg Kot said that Jackson is not " convincing as the vulnerable ladies ' man on drippy ballads " such as " Butterflies " . Stephen Thomas Erlewine , a writer for Allmusic , commented that Invincible was " highlighted " by " lovely ballads " such as " Break of Dawn " and " Butterflies " . David Browne of Entertainment Weekly wrote in his review for Invincible that , " The ballads are a squishy bunch with glaringly banal lyrics , pleasantries like ' Butterflies ' and ' Break of Dawn ' that could emanate from just about " anyone . A journalist for the Philadelphia Inquirer called the track " gorgeous " and <unk> Jones of Salon.com called " Butterflies " a " sparkling " track . Ben Rayer of the Toronto Star wrote that Jackson " fares best " on " Butterflies " .

Jon Pareles , writing for The New York Times , said that tracks on Invincible like " Butterflies " ' and " Don 't Walk Away " are " melting love ballads " . Pareles noted in his review for the album that songs on it are recurring themes present on Jackson 's albums , such as love ballads , as well as tracks pertaining to making the world a better place . Tim <unk> of the Duke Chronicle wrote , " By the time ' Butterflies ' spins on track seven , it 's unclear why Michael didn 't record a collaborative boxed set with Mariah Carey , whose ' Heartbreaker , ' ' Breakdown ' and ' Butterfly ' would fit quite nicely " into Jackson 's Invincible album . Pop music critic <unk> Seymour of the Buffalo News wrote that " another winning tune " on the album is the " dreamy ' Butterflies , ' which flows along at a groovy midtempo pace . " Kevin C.

 = = = Founding and early history = = = 
 Lindenwood University traces its roots back to George Champlin Sibley , an early 19th @-@ century American explorer , soldier , Indian agent , and politician , and his wife Mary Easton Sibley , an educator . In 1808 , Acting Governor and friend Frederick Bates promoted Sibley to the position of chief factor at Fort Osage in western Missouri , near present @-@ day Kansas City , Missouri . While at Fort Osage , Sibley immediately set to work creating relationships with the neighboring Osage tribes . He also Mary Easton , the daughter of Rufus Easton , a prominent St. Louis attorney and Missouri 's second Attorney General . The couple were married in 1815 . During the Sibleys ' time at Fort Osage , Mary began teaching the children at the fort . 
 In 1813 , Sibley opened a temporary trading post at Fort Sibley , now known as the town of Arrow Rock , Missouri , which remained in operation until 1822 . After the trading post shut down , George and Mary remained at Fort Osage , with George serving as postmaster until the fort closed in 1825 . The couple then settled in St. Charles , where Mary began teaching family members and later , in 1827 , other young women from the community . Lindenwood University is now considered the second @-@ oldest higher @-@ education institution west of the Mississippi River , after Saint Louis University , as well as the first women 's college west of the Mississippi . In 1829 , the Sibleys purchased 280 acres ( 113 @.@ 3 ha ) of land , known as the " Linden Wood " because of the numerous linden trees . The Sibleys borrowed money and began clearing the overgrown property to convert it into a farm with livestock brought from Fort Osage . They completed construction of a cabin and outhouses and moved into Linden Wood in December 1829 . As the work on Linden Wood continued , the idea of opening a boarding school evolved . 
 Mary Sibley took in students within a year of moving into the cabin . Her 12 @-@ year @-@ old sister , Alby , became the first student at Linden Wood in the fall of 1830 . A year later , the first two paying students arrived ; in early 1832 , the Sibleys made plans to expand the cabin to create a boarding school for women to over a dozen students During the 1830s , the school was known as The Boarding School for Young Ladies at Linden Wood , Missouri . Mary took charge of the boarding school and developed a strict curriculum that included literature , grammar , writing , spelling , and diction . French , music and piano , landscape painting , flower painting and needle work were available for an additional fee . The school was one of the first to require physical education , which included walking and dancing . 
 By the 1840s , the boarding school had grown to 30 students . As the enrollment expanded , the Sibleys added new rooms to the cabin . The continued improvements created a financial strain on the school and Mary Sibley traveled to the East Coast to solicit additional funding . In the early 1850s , the school was on the brink of closing when the Sibleys offered the property to the Presbyterian Church . In 1853 , the school was incorporated by special act of the Missouri Legislature and became known as the Lindenwood College for Women . The newly chartered college was placed under the control of 15 directors appointed by the Presbytery of St. Louis . On July 4 , 1856 , the cornerstone was laid for a new permanent brick building to replace the original log cabins . The new building , Sibley Hall , was completed in July 1857 , and at the time contained the entire school . This event marked the beginning of a new era of significant growth for Lindenwood . 
 George Sibley died in 1863 . Following his death , the college charter was amended in 1870 to provide that the appointment of directors for the management of the college would be under the control of the Synod of Missouri instead of the Presbytery of St. Louis . A south wing was added to Sibley Hall in 1881 and a north wing in 1886 . The school began expanding in the early 20th century with four new buildings constructed between 1900 and 1920 . 
 In 1913 , the school was accredited as a junior college by the North Central Association . Lindenwood received a $ 4 million bequest in 1918 , the entire estate of the late Margaret Leggat Butler , wife of Colonel James Gay Butler , a Civil War veteran and philanthropist . The college used the funds to establish a permanent endowment and moved from a two @-@ year to a four @-@ year curriculum . A few years later , the college became a full member of the North Central Association . 
 The college became a co @-@ educational institution in 1969 and changed its name from Lindenwood College for Women to Lindenwood Colleges , with a separate college for men and women . In 1970 , the college started offering evening classes and in 1976 began awarding master 's degrees . That same year , the St. Louis Football Cardinals of the NFL constructed a football field for practices . In 1980 , the college became a member of the NAIA for athletics . Lindenwood Colleges , Lindenwood College for Men and Lindenwood College for Women were merged into Lindenwood College in 1983 . It was known as Lindenwood College until 1997 , at which time the school changed its name to the current name of Lindenwood University . 
 = = = Recent history and expansion = = = 
 By 1989 , Lindenwood College was bankrupt with student enrollment below 800 . The college was in danger of closing when the administration hired Dennis Spellmann as the new president . Spellmann immediately began to implement changes , eliminating co @-@ ed dorms and placing the emphasis on a " values @-@ centered " approach in the classroom . 
 The university began an extensive expansion of academic , residential , and athletic facilities starting in the mid @-@ 1990s which included construction of eight new residence halls , the Spellmann Campus Center , Lou Brock Sports Complex , and Harlen C. Hunter Stadium , as well as extensions to Ayres Hall and Harmon Hall . A change that caused controversy for the school was the " Pork for Tuition " program begun in 2002 and designed to help rural families pay for tuition by the university accepting livestock in return for discounts . The animals were then processed and used in the school cafeteria . At the time , People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals staged a small protest in Saint Charles in response to the program . In 2006 , Dennis Spellmann died by which time the university had seen its endowment grow to more than $ 50 million . Dr. James Evans became Lindenwood 's 21st president on February 9 , 2007 . 
 Expansion continued under Evans . The J. Scheidegger Center for the Arts , a performance and fine arts center , opened in late 2008 at a cost of $ 32 million . The university also constructed new dormitories and began building a new home for university presidents . Construction of Evans Commons began in 2009 and was completed during the summer of 2011 . In 2011 , Lindenwood University became the Lindenwood University System . Lindenwood University @-@ Belleville transitioned from a satellite campus to a separately accredited college . The university was notified of the accrediting decision in November by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools . Under the new accreditation , Lindenwood University @-@ Belleville will keep the same name and the same governing board as the St. Charles campus , now considered to be a sister school as part of the Lindenwood University System . By 2010 , Lindenwood University 's endowment had reached $ 148 million Early the following year , Lindenwood began construction of a new parking lot to ease congestion on campus . The university announced a new athletic facility would be constructed behind the west end zone stands of Hunter Stadium . The three @-@ story , 43 @,@ 450 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 4 @,@ 037 m2 ) building includes new football , men 's and women 's soccer , men 's and women 's lacrosse , and field hockey locker rooms . It also houses a new academic support center for student @-@ athletes , coaches ' offices , and meeting rooms overlooking the stadium . Lindenwood plans to construct a new administrative building , as well as additional dorms and campus facilities , and expand enrollment to over 20 @,@ 000 students . The university and the <unk> Group announced in February 2011 that the St. Charles City Council had approved a resolution supporting the Lindenwood Town Center , a planned $ 30 million development that includes a shopping center , retail / business plaza , hotel , and apartment @-@ style student housing complexes . 
 In the fall of 2012 , the university announced it had purchased the 28 @-@ acre ( 11 @.@ 3 ha ) property that was previously home to the Barat Academy . The 69 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 6 @,@ 400 m2 ) facility opened in 2007 and was used by the private high school until it was evicted in 2011 and relocated to a smaller property . Lindenwood purchased the facility for $ 8 @.@ 1 million with plans to enlarge classrooms and add chemistry labs . The building became the home of the Lindenwood Nursing and Allied Health Sciences program opening in fall 2013 . It is a BSN completion program for students who hold associate degrees in nursing . The university hired Dr. Peggy Ellis as the dean of the program . Ellis had served since 2005 as the associate dean of graduate studies at the St. Louis University nursing school . 
 In May 2014 , the Lindenwood University Board of Directors approved plans for a 100 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot Academic Resources Center off First Capitol Drive , adjacent to the Welcome Center on the St. Charles campus . In 2015 , Lindenwood announced the construction of the new facility , which will replace the 36 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot Margaret Leggat Butler Library , built in 1929 . The new Academic Resources Center building will bring together a variety of student services under one roof , including the Writing Center , Student and Academic Support Services ( SASS ) , Career Services , English as a Second Language , the Office of International Students and Scholars , and Lindenwood Online , all of which were involved in putting together the proposal for the new structure . The building will also include classroom space and an expanded coffee shop . Completion is expected in the latter part of 2016 .

 = Vkhutemas = 
 Vkhutemas ( Russian : <unk> , acronym for <unk> художественно @-@ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ( Higher Art and Technical Studios ) ) was the Russian state art and technical school founded in 1920 in Moscow , replacing the Moscow <unk> . The workshops were established by a decree from Vladimir Lenin with the intentions , in the words of the Soviet government , " to prepare master artists of the highest qualifications for industry , and builders and managers for professional @-@ technical education " . The school had 100 faculty members and an enrollment of 2 @,@ 500 students . Vkhutemas was formed by a merger of two previous schools : the Moscow School of Painting , Sculpture and Architecture and the Stroganov School of Applied Arts . The workshops had artistic and industrial faculties ; the art faculty taught courses in graphics , sculpture and architecture while the industrial faculty taught courses in printing , textiles , ceramics , woodworking , and metalworking . It was a center for three major movements in avant garde art and architecture : constructivism , rationalism , and suprematism . In the workshops , the faculty and students transformed attitudes to art and reality with the use of precise geometry with an emphasis on space , in one of the great revolutions in the history of art . In 1926 , the school was reorganized under a new rector and its name was changed from " Studios " to " Institute " ( <unk> , <unk> художественно @-@ <unk> институт , Vkhutein , <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> Institut ) , or Vkhutein . It was dissolved in 1930 , following political and internal pressures throughout its ten @-@ year existence . The school 's faculty , students , and legacy were dispersed into as many as six other schools . 
 = = Basic course = = 
 A preliminary basic course was an important part of the new teaching method that was developed at Vkhutemas , and was made compulsory for all students , regardless of their future specialization . This was based on a combination of scientific and artistic disciplines . During the basic course , students had to learn the language of plastic forms , and <unk> . Drawing was considered a foundation of the plastic arts , and students investigated relationships between color and form , and the principles of spatial composition . Akin to the Bauhaus 's basic course , which all first @-@ year students were required to attend , it gave a more abstract foundation to the technical work in the studios . In the early 1920s this basic course consisted of the following : 
 the maximal influence of color ( given by Lyubov Popova ) , 
 form through color ( Alexander <unk> ) , 
 color in space ( Aleksandra <unk> ) 
 color on the plane ( Ivan <unk> ) , 
 construction ( Alexander Rodchenko ) , 
 simultaneity of form and color ( Aleksandr <unk> ) , 
 volume in space ( Nadezhda <unk> ) , 
 history of the Western arts ( <unk> <unk> ) and 
 tutelage by Wladimir <unk> @-@ <unk> . 
 = = Art faculty = = 
 The primary movements in art which influenced education at Vkhutemas were constructivism and suprematism , although individuals were versatile enough to fit into many or no movements — often teaching in multiple departments and working in diverse media . The leader figure of suprematist art , Kazimir Malevich , joined the teaching staff of Vkhutemas in 1925 , however his group <unk> , of the Vitebsk art college that included El Lissitzky , exhibited at Vkhutemas as early as 1921 . While constructivism was ostensibly developed as an art form in graphics and sculpture , it had architecture and construction as its underlying subject matter . This influence pervaded the school . The artistic education at Vkhutemas tended to be multidisciplinary , which stemmed from its origins as a merger of a fine arts college and a craft school . A further contributor to this was the generality of the basic course , which continued after students had specialised and was complemented by a versatile faculty . Vkhutemas cultivated polymath masters in the Renaissance mold , many with achievements in graphics , sculpture , product design , and architecture . Painters and sculptors often made projects related to architecture ; examples include Tatlin 's Tower , Malevich 's <unk> , and Rodchenko 's Spatial Constructions . Artists moved from department to department , such as Rodchenko from painting to metalworking . Gustav <unk> , who was head of a workshop on colour theory , also moved from painting and sculptural works to exhibition stands and kiosks . El Lissitzky , who had trained as an architect , also worked in a broad cross section of media such as graphics , print and exhibition design . 
 = = Industrial faculty = = 
 The industrial faculties had the task of preparing artists of a new type , artists capable of working not only in the traditional pictorial and plastic arts but also capable of creating all objects in the human environment such as the articles of daily life , the implements of labor , etc . The industrial department at Vkhutemas endeavored to create products of viability in the economy and functionality found in society . Class @-@ based political requirements steered artists toward crafts , and the designing of household or industrial goods . There was significant pressure in this respect by the Central Committee of the Communist Party , that in 1926 , 1927 , and 1928 , required a student body composition " of worker and peasant origins " , and several demands for " working class " elements . This push for design economy resulted in a tendency towards working , functional designs with minimised luxuries . Tables designed by Rodchenko were equipped with mechanical moving parts , and were standardised and multi @-@ functional . The products designed at Vkhutemas never bridged the gap between workshops and factory production , although they cultivated a factory aesthetic — Popova , Stepanova , and Tatlin even designed worker 's industrial apparel . Furniture pieces constructed at Vkhutemas explored the possibilities of new industrial materials such as plywood and tubular steel . 
 There were many successes for the departments , and they were to influence future design thinking . At the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels <unk> in Paris , the Soviet pavilion by Konstantin Melnikov and its contents attracted both criticism and praise for its economic and working class architecture . One focus of criticism was the " nakedness " of the structure , in comparison to other luxurious pavilions such as that by Émile @-@ Jacques Ruhlmann . Alexander Rodchenko designed a worker 's club , and the furniture that the Wood and Metal Working Faculty ( <unk> ) contributed was an international success . The student work won several prizes , and Melnikov 's pavilion won the Grand Prix . As a new generation of artist / designers , the students and faculty at Vkhutemas paved the way for designer furniture by architects such as Marcel Breuer , and Alvar Aalto later in the century . 
 = = = Metalwork and woodwork = = = 
 The dean of this department was Alexander Rodchenko , who was appointed in February 1922 . Rodchenko 's department was more expansive than its name would suggest , concentrating on abstract and concrete examples of product design . In a report to the rector of 1923 , Rodchenko listed the following subjects as being offered : higher mathematics , descriptive geometry , theoretical mechanics , physics , the history of art and political literacy . Theoretical tasks included graphic design and " volumetric and spatial discipline " ; while practical experience was given in foundry work , minting , engraving and <unk> . Students were also given internships in factories . Rodchenko 's approach effectively combined art and technology , and he was offered the deanship of Vkhutein in 1928 , although he refused . El Lissitzky was also a member of the faculty . 
 = = = Textiles = = = 
 The textile department was run by the constructivist designer Varvara Stepanova . In common with other departments , it was run on utilitarian lines , but Stepanova encouraged her students to take an interest in fashion : they were told to carry notebooks so that they could note the contemporary fabrics and aesthetics of everyday life as seen on the high street . Stepanova wrote in her 1925 course plan that this was done " with the goal of devising methods for a conscious awareness of the demands imposed on us by new social conditions " . Lyubov Popova was also a member of the textile faculty , and in 1922 , when hired to design fabrics for the First State Textile Print Factory , Popova and Stepanova were among the first women designers in the Soviet textile industry . Popova designed textiles both with asymmetrical architectonic geometries , and also work that was thematic . Before her death in 1924 , Popova produced fabrics with grids of printed hammers and sickles , which would predate work by others in the political climate of the First Five Year Plan . 
 = = Lenin 's visit = = 
 Vladimir Lenin signed a decree to create the school although its emphasis was on art rather than Marxism . Three months after its founding , on 25 February 1921 , Lenin went to Vkhutemas to visit the daughter of Inessa Armand and to converse with the students , where in a discussion about art he found an affinity among them for Futurism . There he first viewed avant garde art , such as suprematist painting and he did not wholly approve of it , expressing concern over the connection between the student 's art and politics . After the discussion , he was accepting and stated , " Well , tastes differ " and " I am an old man " . 
 Although Lenin was not an enthusiast for avant garde art , the Vkhutemas faculty and students made projects to honor him and further his politics . Ivan <unk> 's final project at Vkhutemas was his design for a Lenin Institute of Librarianship . Vladimir Tatlin 's Monument to the Third International was built by students and displayed at their workshop in Saint Petersburg . Furthermore , Lenin 's Mausoleum was designed by faculty member Aleksey <unk> . Alexei Gan 's book Constructivism , published in 1922 , provided a theoretical link between the new emerging art and contemporary politics , connecting constructivism with the revolution , and Marxism . The founding decree included a statement that students have an " obligatory education in political literacy and the fundamentals of the communist world view on all courses " . These examples help justify the school 's projects in terms of the early political requirements but others would arise throughout the school 's existence . 
 = = Comparisons with the Bauhaus = = 
 Vkhutemas was a close parallel to the German Bauhaus in its intent , organization and scope . The two schools were the first to train artist @-@ designers in a modern manner . Both schools were state @-@ sponsored initiatives to merge the craft tradition with modern technology , with a Basic Course in aesthetic principles , courses in color theory , industrial design , and architecture . Vkhutemas was a larger school than the Bauhaus , but it was less publicised and consequently , is less familiar to the West . Vkhutemas 's influence was expansive however — the school exhibited two structures by faculty and award @-@ winning student work at the 1925 Exposition in Paris . Furthermore , Vkhutemas attracted the interest and several visits from the director of the Museum of Modern Art , Alfred Barr . With the internationalism of modern architecture and design , there were many exchanges between the Vkhutemas and the Bauhaus . The second Bauhaus director Hannes Meyer attempted to organise an exchange between the two schools , while <unk> <unk> of the Bauhaus collaborated with various Vkhutein members on the use of colour in architecture . In addition , El Lissitzky 's book Russia – an Architecture for World Revolution published in German in 1930 featured several illustrations of Vkhutemas / Vkhutein projects . Both schools flourished in a relatively liberal period , and were closed under pressure from increasingly totalitarian regimes . 
 = = Vkhutein = = 
 As early as 1923 , Rodchenko and others published a report in <unk> which foretold of Vkhutemas 's closure . It was in response to students ' failure to gain a foothold in industry and was entitled , The Breakdown of <unk> : Report on the Condition of the Higher Artistic and Technical Workshops , which stated that the school was " disconnected from the ideological and practical tasks of today " . In 1927 , the school 's name was modified : " Institute " replaced " Studios " ( <unk> , <unk> художественно @-@ <unk> институт ) , or Vkhutein . Under this reorganisation , the ' artistic ' content of the basic course was reduced to one term , when at one point it was two years . The school appointed a new rector , Pavel <unk> , who took over from the painter Vladimir <unk> in 1926 . It was under <unk> 's tenure that external political pressures increased , including the " working class " decree , and a series of external reviews by industry , and commercial organisations of student works ' viability . The school was dissolved in 1930 , and was merged into various other programs . One such merger was with <unk> , forming the Architectural @-@ Construction Institute , which became the Moscow Architectural Institute in 1933 . The Modernist movements which Vkhutemas had helped generate were critically considered as abstract formalism , and were succeeded historically by socialist realism , <unk> , and the Empire style of Stalinist architecture . 
 = Rain in England = 
 Rain in England is an ambient hip hop album by Berkeley , California rapper Lil B , released on the label Weird Forest on September 21 , 2010 . Produced by Lil B under his persona " The Based God " , Rain in England is unusual for the hip hop genre because it has no percussive beats . Instead , Lil B raps over new @-@ age @-@ style synthesizer music . The lyrical style , which finds Lil B speaking on topics like family , love and death , has been noted for its sincerity and reflectiveness . 
 The album had a mixed reception upon release , and many critics were left baffled by the album 's highly unorthodox musical and lyrical content . It has been cited as a particularly idiosyncratic release for hip hop music and an example of Lil B 's artistic eccentricities . According to Louis Pattison of The Guardian , the album " transcended familiar notions of good and bad , being one of the most peculiar rap albums ever pressed . " 
 = = Background and music = = 
 Before Rain in England , Lil B had developed a cult following through social media by sharing music through YouTube and MySpace . Lil B wrote the lyrics to Rain in England in a coffee shop over the course of about a month . It was also his first time producing his own music , though he credited the production as a collaboration with his alter ego The Based God . In advance of the album 's release , Lil B told XXL that Rain in England would be " one of the best hip @-@ hop albums to ever come out and one of the most unique albums to ever come out in hip @-@ hop . " Lil B described it as " like a melting pot to the soul , just thinking and melting into your emotions " , and said the album would deal with both dark and positive themes . 
 Rain in England is described by Lil B as the first ambient hip hop album . The lyrics , described as meditative and surreal , explore themes like death , life , family , God , birth and gender . Most tracks begin with Lil B announcing the theme , which he then contemplates in a zigzag of free associative thought . Lil B took care not to use profanity at all on the album . The synthesizer music is droning and tonally simple ; one critic compared the tonality to the nursery rhyme " Three Blind Mice " . Tom Breihan of Pitchfork called Rain in England " an album of quasi @-@ rap spoken @-@ word over self @-@ produced music even more ambient than the spaced @-@ out , lo @-@ fi synth landscapes he usually raps over . " Nitsuh Abebe wrote in Pitchfork 's " Why We Fight " column that the album is " beatless washes of new @-@ <unk> synths with Lil B flowing over them more like the host of a self @-@ hypnosis tape than a rapper . " Rain in England has been compared to the music of Brian Eno , Stars of the Lid , Ray Lynch and Tangerine Dream . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Rain in England was released on September 21 , 2010 on the independent label Weird Forest , which usually focuses on experimental and electronic music . The album was released digitally , as a CD , and as a double LP edition of 1000 copies with a poster . Pitchfork called it " a rare opportunity to own a physical Lil B artifact " . The album officially became available for free from the mixtape website <unk> on November 22 . 
 Critical reception to the album was mixed , with writers acknowledging the album 's uniqueness but questioning its lyrical and musical quality . Sam Davies of The Wire wrote , " There are hits and misses : platitudes and cliches , interspersed with bursts of surreal genius . [ ... ] So much indie <unk> [ sic ] tries to challenge mainstream orthodoxy through a cryptic acceleration of thought and voice [ ... ] but Lil B 's slower , more ruminative delivery here feels far braver for being more exposed and vulnerable . " A positive review in Vice called Lil B " the most revolutionary MC of the last 15 years , " but said Rain in England is not a good starting point for people new to his music because the album is " a bit too raw for most life forms to process " . Rating the album a 6 out of 10 , Charles Aaron of Spin said the album was Lil B 's " least accessible " release to date and sounded like " a therapy @-@ session testimony that sounds like Soulja Boy having a Damascus moment in the champagne room over a beatless synth tide . " 
 Blogger Andrew Nosnitsky of hip hop blog Cocaine Blunts wrote , " while it 's a very personal and honest affair there 's also something , well , not quite good about it . The early buzz about B was that he was making outsider art and England is probably the closest he comes to that standard . He has ideas about what the creation of spoken word poetry and ambient music entails but it 's quite clear he hasn ’ t taken a ton of time to study those forms . " David Morris of Tiny Mix Tapes said that although the album is " conceptually daring " and a showcase for Lil B 's " poetic , philosophical streak " , he called the musical backing " utter garbage " and " pure , unstructured noodling " . Morris blamed what he saw as a misguided effort to be " left @-@ field and trendy " on Lil B 's internet hype and coverage in the indie rock press . The Quietus praised the album as " baffling , flawed but utterly engrossing " , and said Lil B 's flow is " more measured but no less dexterous than his contemporaries , and the pace of his eloquent , brooding verses lend themselves well to the alien , frosted glass synth sounds and syrupy electronics that form the majority of the backing tracks here . Rain In England comes across like the work of some rap savant , a man whose inner filter has been disabled , creating something which may polarise but which is , at least , utterly distinctive . " Daniel Levin Becker wrote in Dusted that , despite its <unk> , the album is " irredeemably bad " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Rain in England has been repeatedly referenced for its uniqueness and its demonstration of Lil B 's broad range of styles . Hip hop writer Andrew Nosnitsky remarked in The Wire that Lil B was likely the only rapper who could pull off both an ambient release on Weird Forest and a collaboration with Soulja Boy in the same year . The San Francisco Bay Guardian said the album demonstrated Lil B 's unpredictability ; similarly , SF Weekly called it " a different beast entirely " from the rest of his work . In Seattle Weekly , Eric Grandy called Rain in England an " oddity " and said Lil B 's music is better served by randomly listening to him on YouTube then in a long @-@ form album format . In a 2012 profile of Lil B 's career so far , The Wire 's Lisa Blanning said the album " feels like a new musical expression . " Lil B himself described Rain in England as " my favorite work ... I think that 's my most powerful work , to myself . ... That 's my favorite , because I know no one else has done that , and that 's what I 'm most proud of , when I do things that I know nobody else has done before . " 
 At the end of the year , the album received one vote in the Village Voice Pazz & Jop music critics poll . Rob Sevier , co @-@ founder of the label The Numero Group , and Games , a collaboration between Daniel Lopatin ( Oneohtrix Point Never ) and Joel Ford , named Rain in England one of their favorite albums of the year . Dean Blunt of the electronic duo Hype Williams admired the album and said , " it was artistic , it was the merit . ... Part of the reason it 's so interesting , part of the reason why I think this is so good , it 's a juxtaposition of two things that you really don 't think are meant to be together . " Oakland , California rapper Kreayshawn said Lil B " was an influence on me . I was starting to listen to his music and hanging out with him a lot when he was working on Rain in England . " Cloud rap duo Main Attrakionz has been compared to the style of Rain in England . 
 At Lil B 's unscripted lecture at New York University in 2012 , a fan told Lil B , possibly facetiously , that his mom cried while listening to the track " All Women " . Lil B responded : 
 I love you . Thank you family . I love you man . Respect knowledge . If you see somebody with gray hair , embrace that beauty . Show the world that we are beautiful ! That was me trying to get everybody to rally . Show the world we 're beautiful ! 
 Lil B also said at the lecture that he was " the first artist ever to release an ambient album in history with no cursing , Rain in England . " Portland @-@ based producer E * Rock adapted a transcript of the lecture into an ambient music piece with a synthesized voice , and the result was compared to Rain in England .

 = Deep frying = 
 Deep frying ( also referred to as deep fat frying ) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat , most commonly oil , rather than the shallow oil used in conventional frying , done in a frying pan . Normally , a deep fryer or chip pan is used for this ; industrially , a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used . Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot . Deep frying is classified as hot @-@ fat cooking method Typically , deep frying cooks foods quickly : all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has a high rate of heat conduction . 
 The term " deep frying " and many modern deep @-@ fried foods were not invented until the 19th century , but the practice has been around for millennia . Early records and cookbooks suggest that the practice began in a few European and Arabian countries before other countries adopted the practice . 
 Deep frying is popular worldwide , with deep @-@ fried foods accounting for a large portion of global caloric consumption . Many foods are deep @-@ fried and cultures surrounding deep frying have developed , most notably in the Southern United States , where many events dedicated to deep frying food and non @-@ edible items are held . 
 = = History = = 
 Although the nouns " deep @-@ fried " , " deep @-@ frying " , and the verb " deep @-@ fry " were not documented until 1916 , 1932 , and 1933 ( respectively ) ; the practice of deep frying food has been around much longer . One of the earliest known practices of deep frying came from the Egyptians in the 5th millennium BCE . Later developments included the Greeks deep frying food in olive oil in the 5th century BCE . In the 1st century CE , a Roman cookbook , Apicius , appears to list the ancient Romans ' first use of deep frying to prepare Pullum <unk> , a chicken dish . The practice of deep frying spread to other parts of Europe and Arabia in the following centuries . Deep @-@ fried foods such as funnel cakes arrived in northern Europe by the 13th century , and deep @-@ fried fish recipes have been found in cookbooks in Spain and Portugal at around the same time . Falafel arrived in the Middle East from population migrations from Egypt as soon as the 14th century . The deep frying of food in Japan was likely introduced by Portuguese the 16th century . Evidence of potato frying can be found as early as the late 17th century in Europe . 
 Modern deep frying began in the 19th century with the growing popularity of cast iron , particularly around the American South which led to the development of many modern deep @-@ fried dishes . French fries , invented in the late 18th century , became popular in the early 19th century western Europe . Doughnuts were invented in the mid @-@ 19th century , with foods such as onion rings , deep @-@ fried turkey , and corn dogs all being invented in the early 20th century . In recent years , the growth of fast food has expanded the reach of deep @-@ fried foods , especially French fries . 
 = = Technique = = 
 Deep frying food is defined as a process where food is completely submerged in hot oil at temperatures typically between 350 ° F ( 177 ° C ) and 375 ° F ( 191 ° C ) . One common method for preparing food for deep frying involves adding multiple layers of batter around the food , such as cornmeal , flour , or tempura ; breadcrumbs may also be used . After the food is submerged in oil , the surface of it begins to dehydrate and it undergoes Maillard reactions which break down sugars and proteins , creating the golden brown exterior of the food . Once the surface is dehydrated , it forms a crust which prevents further oil absorption . The heat conducts throughout the food causing proteins to denature , starches to undergo starch gelatinization , and dietary fiber to soften . 
 While most foods need batter coatings for protection , it is not as necessary for cooked noodles and potatoes because their high starch content enables them to hold more moisture and resist shrinking . Meats may be cooked before deep frying to ensure that they are done inside while keeping <unk> . 
 When performed properly , deep frying does not make food excessively greasy , because the moisture in the food repels the oil . The hot oil heats the water within the food , steaming it ; oil cannot go against the direction of this powerful flow because ( due to its high temperature ) the water vapor pushes the bubbles toward the surface . As long as the oil is hot enough and the food is not immersed in the oil for too long , oil penetration will be confined to the outer surface . Foods deep @-@ fried at proper temperatures typically absorb " no more than a couple of tablespoons per 2 1 ⁄ 2 cups of oil " used . This oil absorption rate is around the same as occurs with shallow frying , such as in a pan . 
 However , if the food is cooked in the oil for too long , much of the water will be lost and the oil will begin to penetrate the food . The correct frying temperature depends on the thickness and type of food , but in most cases it lies between 350 – 375 ° F ( 177 – 191 ° C ) . An informal test for a temperature close to this range involves adding a tiny amount of flour into the oil and watching to see if it sizzles without immediately burning . A second test involves adding one piece of food to deep fry and watching it sink somewhat and rise back up . Sinking without resurfacing indicates that the oil is too cold ; not sinking at all indicates that the oil is too hot . 
 It is recommended that deep fryers be cleaned often to prevent contamination . The process of cooking with oil can also contaminate nearby surfaces as oil may splatter on adjacent areas . Oil vapors can also condense on more distant surfaces such as walls and ceilings . Supplies such as dish detergent and baking soda can effectively clean affected surfaces . 
 = = Tools = = 
 Deep frying is done with a deep fryer , a pan such as a wok or chip pan , a Dutch oven , or a cast @-@ iron pot . Additional tools include fry baskets , which are used to contain foods in a deep fryer and to strain foods when removed from the oil , and cooking thermometers , used to gauge oil temperature . <unk> , slotted spoons , wooden spoons , and sieves may be used to remove or separate foods from the hot oil . 
 Japanese deep frying tools include long metal chopsticks ; the <unk> @-@ <unk> deep frying pot , which is heavy for retaining heat and deep for holding oil ; the ami @-@ <unk> net ladle used for scooping out batter debris ; and the <unk> @-@ kiri oil drying rack pan .

 = = Oil deterioration = = 
 Overheating or over @-@ using the frying oil leads to formation of rancid @-@ tasting products of oxidation , polymerization , and other deleterious , unintended or even toxic compounds such as acrylamide ( from starchy foods ) . Recent research suggests fat deterioration may be worse when fat or oil is fried with food than when fat or oil is tested on its own in a laboratory . Deep @-@ frying under vacuum helps to significantly reduce acrylamide formation , but this process is not widely used in the food industry due to the high investment cost involved . 
 Some useful tests and indicators of excessive oil deterioration are the following : 
 Sensory – darkening , smoke , foaming , thickening , rancid taste and unpleasant smell when heating . This is the most unreliable way to decide when to change oil because those are very individual factors and can depend on different causes . 
 Testing strips – decide when to change oil depending on FFA ( free fatty acids ) only 
 <unk> – measurement tool to exactly define the point of change oil by <unk> / TPC ( Total polar material / compounds ) 
 Laboratory – acidity , <unk> value , viscosity , total polar compounds , polymeric triglycerides . 
 Instruments that indicate total polar compounds , currently the best single gauge of how deep @-@ fried an object is , are available with sufficient accuracy for restaurant and industry use . 
 = = Hazards = = 
 Cooking oil is flammable , and fires may be caused by it igniting at too high a temperature . Further , attempts to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely dangerous condition , a <unk> , as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil , in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire . This is the leading cause of house fires in the United Kingdom . Instead , oil fires must be extinguished with a non @-@ water fire extinguisher or by smothering . Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder ( e.g. , baking soda , salt ) or fire fighting foam . Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam . 
 <unk> hot cooking oil can also cause severe third degree burns , In the worst @-@ case scenario , severe burns can be fatal . The higher temperatures and tendency of oil to stick to the skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water . Children can accidentally place their hands on top of the stove , playing with the materials while being cooked , or accidentally pull the pot down , which can cause significant injury . The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present , to protect their safety at all times .

 Deep frying produces large amounts of waste oil , which must be disposed of properly . Waste oil can overflow sewage systems , bind to the walls of sewage pipes , and interfere with sewage treatment . Waste oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel . Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water , which makes the time required to deep fry them into chips longer . This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time . According to one source , an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2 @,@ 000 watts . 
 = = = Health = = = 
 The process of deep frying food is generally detrimental to its nutritional value . The oils that foods absorb in their batter typically contain large amounts of fats , especially saturated fats and trans fats . Consumption of large amounts of saturated and trans fats has been linked to a higher risk for some cancers including prostate cancer . Eating deep @-@ fried foods has also been linked to higher cholesterol levels , obesity , heart attacks , and diabetes . Deep @-@ fried foods cooked at certain temperatures can also contain acrylamide , a possible carcinogen . Additionally , fat degradation processes during deep frying results in the loss of nutritional value in deep @-@ fried foods . 
 Some studies have found that deep frying in olive and sunflower oils has been found to be less of a detriment to health and in some cases have positive effects on insulin levels . Oil can be reused a few times after original use after straining out solids . However , excessive use of the same oil can cause it to break down and release compounds into the food that may be carcinogenic , affect liver health , or influence the body 's ability to absorb vitamins . Some European countries have set public health standards for the safety of frying oil . 
 = Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U = 
 Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U are fighting video games developed by Sora Ltd. and Bandai Namco Games , with assistance from tri @-@ Crescendo , and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U game consoles . Despite being similarly titled games , even with almost similar content , the two titles are officially considered the fourth and fifth installments , respectively , in the Super Smash Bros. series of games by creator and game director Masahiro Sakurai . 
 Like the rest of the series , Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U are non @-@ traditional fighting games where players use different attacks to weaken their opponents and knock them out of an arena . The games are crossover titles that feature characters , items , music , and stages from various Nintendo franchises , including Mario , Donkey Kong , Pokémon , Fire Emblem , Kirby , Metroid , Star Fox , The Legend of Zelda , Kid Icarus , and Animal Crossing among others , as well as from several third @-@ party franchises , including Sega 's Sonic the Hedgehog and Bayonetta , Capcom 's Mega Man and Street Fighter , Bandai Namco 's Pac @-@ Man , and Square Enix 's Final Fantasy VII . New features include having up to eight players fighting at a time on the Wii U version , support for Amiibo , using Miis as playable fighters , post @-@ release downloadable content including additional fighters and stages , and customizable special moves unlockable for every non @-@ DLC character . Some features from previous games in the series were removed , such as the story mode in Brawl . 
 A sequel to Brawl was announced at E3 2011 , but development did not begin until 2012 , and the game 's official unveiling did not come until E3 2013 . The gameplay was designed to be somewhere between that of the faster , more competition @-@ oriented Melee and the slower , more casual @-@ friendly Brawl . The 3DS version was released in Japan in September 2014 , and in North America , Europe , and Australia in October 2014 . The Wii U version was released in North America , Europe , and Australia in November 2014 , and in Japan in December 2014 . 
 Critics applauded the fine @-@ tuning of existing Super Smash Bros. gameplay elements , but criticized some issues with online play . Both versions sold well , with the 3DS version selling over 8 @.@ 12 million copies worldwide by March 2016 , and the Wii U version selling over 4 @.@ 80 million copies during the same period of time . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Like in previous games in the series , Super Smash Bros. is a multiplayer fighting game in which the players use various attacks , techniques , and items to deal damage to their opponents and knock their opponents out of the arena . As a character 's damage percentage increases , they fly back further when attacked , and may eventually be knocked far enough out of the playing field to be knocked out . To assist players during battle , items sometimes appear on the battlefield if turned on , most of which represent the various video games represented in the series . An item called a Smash Ball allows players to use a powerful , character @-@ specific attack , otherwise known as the " Final Smash " . Another item is an Assist Trophy , which summons various non @-@ playable characters from a represented series onto the field to assist the summoner . Both of them were previously introduced in Super Smash Bros. Brawl . Like its predecessors , Super Smash Bros. features collectible in @-@ game trophies based on characters or items seen in various Nintendo or third @-@ party games . Each stage now features an alternate Omega form , which replaces the stage 's layout with a flat surface with ledges on both sides and removes all stage hazards . Certain stages , collectible trophies , and game features are exclusive to each version of game , with the Wii U version primarily featuring elements taken from home console titles and the 3DS version taking elements primarily from handheld titles . Both games feature revisited stages from past entries in the series and new stages representing newly @-@ introduced properties or recent entries in existing ones . 
 New to the series is the ability to customize both existing characters and custom Mii Fighters , altering their attacks and giving them unique power @-@ ups . These characters can be transferred between the 3DS and Wii U versions of the game , as well as certain items earned in specific modes . Additionally , players can use amiibo to train computer controlled players and import them into a match . Both versions of the game support local and online multiplayer . Whereas local and online matches with friends have fully customizable rules , online matches with strangers are divided into two modes : " For Fun " and " For Glory . " For Fun features random stages and items , with time matches only and Omega stages omitted , while For Glory features stock matches with no items exclusively on Omega stages and features both standard Smash and 1 @-@ on @-@ 1 battles , all of which the player 's wins and losses are recorded from For Glory . Customized characters , Mii Fighters , and amiibo cannot be used in online matches against strangers . Additionally , solo play once again features Classic mode , which features an intensity setting directly influenced by Masahiro Sakurai 's previous project Kid Icarus : Uprising , in which players can make the game more difficult by spending in @-@ game currency in order to earn greater rewards . Both versions share two new modes . Target Blast has players beat up a ticking bomb before launching it into a set of targets , with the goal of earning as many points as possible by causing chain reactions . Trophy Rush has players clear out falling crates to build up a Fever meter and quickly earn new trophies and customization items . 
 In addition to a moderation system to prevent <unk> , the game features an online ranking system called " Global Smash Power " for a player 's solo mode score , which shows how many other players someone has outscored , rather than listing their position on a leaderboard . Although the game does not feature a ranking system for online matches , matchmaking between players of similar skill levels was introduced . Online also features Spectator Mode , where spectators can place bets on other players to win more gold , and Conquest , in which players can support selected characters by playing as them online , earning rewards if their supported team wins , and earning bonus rewards for going on a win streak .

 The Nintendo 3DS version features stereoscopic 3D graphics with optional cel @-@ shaded outlines to make the characters more visible . The game also features two exclusive modes ; Smash Run and <unk> . Smash Run , based on the City Trial mode from Kirby Air Ride , has players navigate an open environment , fighting computer @-@ controlled enemies to earn stat @-@ increasing power @-@ ups , before facing each other in a randomly selected match , such as vertical or horizontal races against each other or battles with various special rules . <unk> is a StreetPass @-@ based game in which players control a disc on a top @-@ down board and attempt to knock their opponents out of the arena . The 3DS version supports the additional controls featured on the New Nintendo 3DS , such as using the C @-@ Stick to trigger Smash Attacks , but is not compatible with the Circle Pad Pro peripheral because of hardware limitations . 
 The Wii U version features high @-@ definition graphics ( native <unk> ) and a special mode that allows up to eight players simultaneously . This mode is restricted to certain larger stages and cannot be played online , though additional stages were made available for eight players via post @-@ release update patches . Various modes from the 3DS version , such as Classic mode , feature various changes in the Wii U version , with some modes allowing two players to play cooperatively or against each other in other modes . The Wii U version also features three exclusive new game modes ; Smash Tour , Special Orders , and Event Mode . Smash Tour is a traditional board game @-@ type mode in which up to four players assemble a team of fighters that they pick up on the board . Players have the ability to change size of the game board , the number of turns , and choose if they allow to have custom characters on the board ( not including Miis ) . In this mode , players earn stat increasing power @-@ ups , triggering various battles and events along the way . Special Orders is a series of challenges set by Master Hand and Crazy Hand , which players can attempt to earn rewards . Each time a battle is won , the reward and the stakes will rise , but if a round is lost , all accumulated prizes will be lost . In Event Mode , one or two players can participate in themed challenges , moving along the path by completion . The Wii U version has vast compatibility with controllers ; Wii U GamePad , Wii Remote , Wii Remote and Nunchuk , Classic Controller , Classic Controller Pro , Wii U Pro Controller , GameCube controller through GameCube Controller Adapter for Wii U , and the Nintendo 3DS systems ( using either a copy of the 3DS version , or a Smash Controller app released on June 14 , 2015 ) . Returning features unique to this version include Special Smash , allowing for unique rules , Stage Builder and Photo mode , which allow players to create personalized stages and dioramas ( with a compatible SD card ) , and demo versions of classic games in a " Masterpieces " gallery . An update on April 15 , 2015 added content @-@ sharing features , with a Miiverse stage added for free on June 14 , 2015 . An update released on July 31 , 2015 added an online tournament mode .

 Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U features a roster of 58 playable characters ( 51 on @-@ disc and 7 available as downloadable content ) taken from both Nintendo 's first @-@ party franchises and some third @-@ party franchises , including returning character Sonic the Hedgehog . The base game includes 19 newcomers to the series : the Wii Fit Trainer , Animal Crossing 's Villager , Rosalina and Bowser Jr. from the Mario series ( with Rosalina being accompanied by a Luma ) , Little Mac from Punch @-@ Out ! ! , <unk> from Pokémon X and Y , Palutena and Dark Pit from Kid Icarus : Uprising , Lucina and Robin from Fire Emblem Awakening , Shulk from Xenoblade Chronicles , the dog and duck as a duo from Duck Hunt , Capcom 's Mega Man , Bandai Namco 's Pac @-@ Man , and the Mii Fighter , which can be customized with one of three fighting styles : Brawler , <unk> , and Gunner . 
 Some characters such as Wii Fit Trainer and Bowser Jr. have multiple variations , such as different genders and alternate character skins , which are selected in the same manner as alternate colors . Some returning fighters who could change forms during a match in previous titles are now playable solely as individual characters . As such , Zelda , Sheik , Samus , and Zero Suit Samus are now all individual fighters , along with Charizard , who was previously included alongside the now @-@ absent Squirtle and <unk> in the Pokémon Trainer 's team in Brawl . Dr. Mario , a cloned fighter based on Mario who first appeared in Super Smash Bros. Melee , makes his return to the roster after his absence in Brawl . The Ice Climbers were originally planned for inclusion , but were removed due to the technical limitations of the 3DS . Wolf O 'Donnell and Solid Snake are also absent following their appearances in the previous game .

 In addition to the main roster , seven additional characters , including three returning characters and four newcomers , were released as downloadable content between April 2015 and February 2016 . Mewtwo , who last appeared in Melee , was released on April 28 , 2015 , but was made available on April 15 , 2015 for Club Nintendo members who purchased and registered both 3DS and Wii U versions of the game before March 31 , 2015 . Roy from Fire Emblem : The Binding Blade and Lucas from Mother 3 , who last appeared in Melee and Brawl respectively , along with Ryu from Capcom 's Street Fighter franchise , were released on June 14 , 2015 . Cloud Strife from Square Enix 's Final Fantasy VII was released on December 15 , 2015 following increasing requests for Final Fantasy series characters . Finally , Corrin from Fire Emblem Fates and Bayonetta from Sega 's Bayonetta series were released on February 3 , 2016 , in North America and in Europe and Japan the next day . Bayonetta was chosen as the overall winner worldwide among " negotiable and realizable " characters in a player @-@ nominated ballot which ran between April 1 , 2015 and October 3 , 2015 , ranking first in Europe and among the top five in North America . Corrin was developed as a downloadable character in response to the critical and commercial success of Fire Emblem Fates in Japan and in anticipation for the game 's worldwide localization . 
 = = Development = = 
 Former Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata first announced that a new Super Smash Bros. game was planned for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U at E3 2011 in June 2011 , but development only officially began following the completion of series creator Masahiro Sakurai 's other project , Kid Icarus : Uprising , in March 2012 . The game was later revealed to be a joint @-@ project between Sora Ltd. and Bandai Namco Games , with various staff members from Bandai Namco 's Soulcalibur and Tekken series assisting Sakurai in development . Sakurai , who was previously the sole person responsible for balance in the series ' multiple fighters , has involved more staff to further improve the game 's competitive balance . The game was officially revealed at E3 2013 on June 11 , 2013 , during a Nintendo Direct . Along with screenshots being posted each weekday on the game 's official website and Miiverse community , various cinematic trailers were released , introducing each of the brand new fighters . Sakurai chose to use these trailers , which benefit from Internet sharing , as opposed to including a story campaign similar to the Subspace Emissary mode featured in Brawl , as he believed the impact of seeing the mode 's cinematic cutscenes for the first time was ruined by people uploading said scenes to video sharing websites . 
 At E3 2013 , Sakurai stated that the tripping mechanic introduced in Brawl had been omitted , with him also stating that the gameplay was between the fast @-@ paced and competitive style of Melee and the slower and more casual style of Brawl . While the game does not feature cross @-@ platform play between the Wii U and 3DS , due to each version featuring certain exclusive stages and gamemodes , there is the option to transfer customized characters and items between the two versions . The game builds upon the previous game 's third @-@ party involvement with the addition of third @-@ party characters such as Capcom 's Mega Man and Bandai Namco 's Pac @-@ Man , as well as the return of Sega 's Sonic the Hedgehog . This involvement expands beyond playable characters , as other third @-@ party characters , such as Ubisoft 's Rayman , are also included in the game as trophies . The addition of Mii characters was made in response to the growing number of requests from fans to have their dream characters included in the game . To prevent potential bullying , as well as to maintain game balance online , Mii Fighters cannot be used in online matches against strangers . The decision to release the Wii U version at a later date from the 3DS version was made to allow each version to receive a dedicated debugging period . Hardware limitations on the Nintendo 3DS led to various design choices , such as the removal of mid @-@ match transformations , the lack of Circle Pad Pro support , and the absence of the Ice Climbers , from the NES game Ice Climber , who were previously playable in both Melee and Brawl . 
 In late August 2014 , a series of allegedly leaked photos and videos of the 3DS version were uploaded to the Internet , revealing at the time several unannounced fighters . The original videos were removed shortly thereafter citing a copyright claim by Nintendo of America . These leaks were confirmed on September 11 , 2014 when various gamers in Japan and Taiwan obtained the 3DS version two days prior to its release date and streamed footage of the game on Twitch . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Like previous games in the series , Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U features many original and re @-@ arranged musical pieces from various different gaming franchises . Both versions have multiple musical tracks that can be selected and listened to using the " My Music " feature , including pieces taken directly from earlier Super Smash Bros. titles . The 3DS version features less music altogether than the Wii U version however , and only has two songs per stage because of size limitations . The 3DS version also has a " Play in Sleep Mode " option , allowing players to listen to the game 's music from the sound menu whilst the system is in sleep mode . 
 On August 22 , 2014 , the Super Smash Bros. website revealed the list of composers and arrangers for the game . Various well known video game composers and musicians such as Masashi Hamauzu , Yuzo Koshiro , Yasunori Mitsuda , Motoi Sakuraba , Yoko Shimomura , Mahito Yokota , Akari Kaida , Michiru Yamane , Koji Kondo , Kazumi Totaka , and Hiroshi Okubo , among many others , contributed new arrangements for the game .

 In an announcement for the Super Smash Bros. Invitational , a tournament which was held at E3 2014 , Nintendo revealed an official GameCube controller adapter for the Wii U , which allows players to use GameCube controllers with the game , as well as a Smash Bros. themed game controller . The adapter and controllers were released alongside the game and are also available separately , but vary depending on the region . 
 Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS was released in Japan on September 13 , 2014 , in North America and Europe on October 3 , 2014 , and in Australia on October 4 , 2014 . A playable demo was released on the Nintendo eShop on September 10 , 2014 , in Japan and on September 19 , 2014 , in North America and Europe . Select Club Nintendo Platinum members in North America and Europe received early access to the 3DS demo which , unlike the public demo of the game , had an unlimited number of plays . The Wii U version was released in North America on November 21 , 2014 , in Europe on November 28 , 2014 , in Australia on November 29 , 2014 , and in Japan on December 6 , 2014 . Bundles containing Amiibo figures were available at launch , with plans to eventually release figures of every fighter , including downloadable ones . 
 On April 15 , 2015 , a software update was released , adding the ability to purchase additional content , such as playable characters , new stages and Mii Fighter costumes , and addressing some balancing issues in the game . It also enabled online sharing of photos , Mii fighters , replays and custom stages . An update released on July 31 , 2015 , added an online tournament mode and the ability to upload replays to YouTube . A Smash Controller app released on Nintendo eShop on June 14 , 2015 , allows players to use the Nintendo 3DS as a controller for the Wii U version without needing a copy of the 3DS version .

 Reviews for the 3DS version were positive , with a rating of 85 / 100 on Metacritic . The game was praised for its large and diverse character roster , its improvements to game mechanics , and its variety of multiplayer options . Some criticisms include a lack of single player modes and issues concerning the 3DS hardware , such as the size of characters on the smaller screen when zoomed out and latency issues during both local and online multiplayer . There were also reports of players damaging their 3DS Circle Pads while playing the game excessively . The 3DS version sold over a million copies in its first weekend on sale in Japan , and had sold more than 3 @.@ 22 million copies worldwide by the end of October 2014 . 
 The Wii U version received critical acclaim , receiving praise for its variety of gameplay modes and for improvements upon features in the 3DS version . It has a Metacritic score of 92 / 100 and is among the highest reviewed games of 2014 . Daniel Bischoff of Game Revolution called it " the biggest leap forward Smashers have seen yet , " praising the game for its graphics and " incredibly fast action . " Daniel Starkey at GameSpot criticized the inconsistent performance of online multiplayer , but still called the game " incredible , " noting , " With the Wii U release , Smash Bros. has fully realized its goals . " Jose Otero from IGN praised the game for " appeal [ ing ] to the nostalgia of long @-@ time Nintendo fans " while also being " accessible to new players . " Thomas Schulenberg of Joystiq criticized occasional " matches plagued with stuttering frame rates " during online play and discussed his " indifference toward the Amiibo experience " but praised the game for its " abundance of goals to chase .

 = Brighton Forum = 
 <unk> Brighton ( previously known as the The Brighton Forum by <unk> ) is a complex of serviced offices on a prominent elevated position in the Round Hill area of Brighton , part of the English city of Brighton and Hove . The large Gothic Revival building , by two architect brothers from London , has had three greatly different uses since its construction at the edge of Brighton parish in 1854 : for its first 85 years , it trained Anglican <unk> ; then it became a military base and records office ; and in 1988 it opened as a multipurpose business centre and office complex . The elaborate flint exterior is finely detailed in the Gothic style , especially around the windows . English Heritage has listed it at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance . 
 = = History = = 
 The ancient Sussex fishing village of Brighthelmston , which in the 18th and 19th centuries developed into the fashionable seaside resort of Brighton , lay within the Anglican Diocese of Chichester . In the 19th century , before the Elementary Education Act 1870 centralised the provision of primary @-@ level education and established school boards , most 5- to 12 @-@ year @-@ olds were taught ( if at all ) at schools founded and sponsored by charities , private benefactors or churches . There were many such church schools in Brighton : Anglican churches with their own schools included Christ Church , St Bartholomew 's , St John the Evangelist 's , St Mark 's , St Martin 's , St Paul 's and St Stephen 's . 
 The Diocese established an institute to train female schoolteachers for the Anglican schools in Brighton and the rest of Sussex in Black Lion Street in The Lanes ( the ancient heart of the town ) in April 1842 . This was done in association with the National Society for the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church . More space was soon needed , so in 1854 it found a site on the west side of Ditchling Road on which to build a larger college . Ditchling Road , which ran across Ditchling Beacon to Ditchling village and then on to Cuckfield and eventually London , became a turnpike in 1770 and was thereafter one of the main north – south routes into and out of Brighton . The chosen site was on the north side of Viaduct Road , which was built to link Ditchling and London Roads and which formed the northern edge of Brighton 's ecclesiastical parish and municipal borough until 1873 . 
 The architects William and Edward Habershon were commissioned to design the new building . They were based in London but worked extensively in Sussex ; buildings they designed separately or together in the county include St Leonards @-@ on @-@ Sea Congregational Church , St John the Baptist 's Church in Hove , St Helen 's Church in Ore and St Augustine 's Church at <unk> Hill . They started work at the large corner site in 1854 , and the building was ready later that year . The local firm of Edmund Scott and F.T. Cawthorn extended the building to the rear ( north side ) in 1886 . 
 Teachers continued to be trained at the college ( officially called the Chichester Diocesan Training College for <unk> ) until 1939 . As World War II approached , the institution closed and the building was auctioned ; but before it could be sold , the Royal Engineers requisitioned it for their use during wartime . They used it as a base for their operations , then after the war it became their archives and records office . In 1987 , they moved out , and the vacant building was threatened with demolition . A local campaign helped it receive listed status , offering a degree of protection , and the building 's future was secured when it was bought and converted into a complex of serviced offices . It opened in November 1988 as the Brighton Business Centre , and was later renamed the Brighton Forum . 
 The Brighton Forum was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 22 March 1988 . This status is given to " nationally important buildings of special interest " . As of February 2001 , it was one of 1 @,@ 124 Grade II @-@ listed buildings and structures , and 1 @,@ 218 listed buildings of all grades , in the city of Brighton and Hove . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Brighton Forum is built on a high , prominent corner position , giving it good visibility from the west and south and long southward views . <unk> flint is the main building material , augmented by stone dressings and some yellow brickwork to the quoins . The roof is laid with tiles . 
 The two @-@ storey façade to Viaduct Road is E @-@ shaped and regular , with a symmetrical seven @-@ bay plan . The first and seventh bays project further forward than the centre ( fourth ) bay , which is formed by an elevated entrance porch . This has lancet windows on the sides , grouped under single hood moulds and with a string course . The doorway is under a segmental arch which is topped by a gable . The rest of the ground floor has larger lancets arranged in pairs and with a small trefoil above . The south @-@ facing walls have two pairs together , while on the inward @-@ facing walls of the first and seventh bays there are two sets of paired windows placed some distance apart . At first @-@ floor level , similar paired lancets and trefoils rise as gabled dormers above the roofline . The south walls of the first and seventh bays have prominent five @-@ light oriel windows , canted to form a 1 – 3 – 1 pattern of trefoil @-@ headed panes . These oriel windows are supported on ornate corbels . Above these at first @-@ floor level , and also above the entrance porch , there are three @-@ light trefoil @-@ headed windows set under a segmental arch @-@ shaped hood mould . Many of the windows on the south side have plate tracery . 
 The eastern face ( to Ditchling Road ) has eight bays and a carriage arch at the north end . The first four bays have trefoil @-@ headed lancet windows , while the next four have simpler straight @-@ headed windows . The carriage arch is segmental @-@ headed . The first floor has eight dormers . On the west side , the roof is cross @-@ gabled : the gables are parallel to , rather than perpendicular to , the ridge . 
 = Marie @-@ Rosalie Cadron @-@ Jetté = 
 Marie @-@ Rosalie Cadron Jetté , S.M. , ( née Cadron , January 27 , 1794 – April 5 , 1864 ) , also known as Marie of the Nativity , was a Canadian widow and midwife who undertook the charitable care of unwed and struggling mothers between 1840 and 1864 . Out of this work , she became the foundress of the Congregation of the Sisters of Misericorde . The cause for her canonization is now being studied in the Vatican . Pope Francis declared her " Venerable " in 2013 . 
 Cadron @-@ Jetté was born and raised in Lavaltrie , Quebec , and in 1811 married Jean @-@ Marie Jetté . They had 11 children , several of whom died young . In 1827 she moved to Montreal and in 1832 her husband died of cholera . From 1840 , in collaboration with Ignace Bourget ( then Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Montreal ) , she engaged in the charitable care of unwed mothers . At this time in Montreal , unwed mothers and those associating with them attracted a significant social stigma . Cadron @-@ Jetté operated initially out of her own home and the homes of her children , and later , with the aid of other women , worked from a series of buildings known as the Hospice de Sainte @-@ Pélagie . In 1848 , she took religious vows , along with several other women , and founded a Roman Catholic religious institute known as the Sisters of Misericorde , dedicated to the care of unwed mothers and their children . In 1849 she obtained formal midwifery qualifications . In 1853 the Misericorde Sisters built a convent on the corner of Dorchester Boulevard and Saint @-@ André Street and she lived there the remainder of her life . 
 Cadron @-@ Jetté died in 1864 . After her death , Ignace Bourget , with whom she had worked closely throughout her life , proposed that Cadron @-@ Jetté be considered for canonization by the Roman Catholic Church . Over a century later , in 1989 , the proposal was put into effect and her canonization cause was opened . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Rosalie Cadron was born in Lavaltrie , Quebec on January 27 , 1794 , the older of two daughters . Her father was Antoine Cadron , a farmer , and her mother Rosalie Roy , a midwife . Her sister was Sophie Cadron ( born March 21 , 1806 ) . Her family was Roman Catholic and shortly after birth she was baptized by the Abbé Louis Lamotte . She lived at a family home on the Rue Notre @-@ Dame in Lavaltrie until 1822 . 
 Cadron undertook brief education while boarding at a convent located in Pointe @-@ aux @-@ Trembles in east Montreal , but returned home due to loneliness after only a few weeks . She did not learn to read until later in life , and appears to have never learned to write . After returning from the convent , she was educated at home in housekeeping , sewing and crafts . In 1806 Cadron took First Communion . 
 At the age of 16 or 17 , Cadron met a travelling salesman named Jean @-@ Marie Jetté , possibly while at a family gathering , and married him on October 7 , 1811 at the Church of Lavaltrie . Jean @-@ Marie was the brother of Paul Jetté , Cadron 's uncle by marriage , and at the time the two met he was in his thirties . After the wedding , Rosalie Cadron took her husband 's name and was known as Rosalie Cadron @-@ Jetté . Jean @-@ Marie moved into Cadron @-@ Jetté 's parents ' house with her , and undertook a new career as a farmer . In 1811 , that house , along with the surrounding land and outbuildings , was donated to Cadron @-@ Jetté and Jean @-@ Marie by Cadron @-@ Jetté 's parents , on the condition that the parents be allowed to live there until their death , and that Cadron @-@ Jetté and Jean @-@ Marie assume the care of Cadron @-@ Jetté 's sister Sophie until her age of majority . 
 Between 1812 and 1832 Cadron @-@ Jetté and Jean @-@ Marie had 11 children , five of whom died young ( four prior to Jean @-@ Marie 's death , and one afterwards , in 1836 ) . The children were Jean @-@ Marie Junior ( born 1812 ) , Marie @-@ Rose ( born 1813 ) , Pierre ( born 1815 ) , Francois ( born 1817 ) , <unk> ( born 1819 ) , Joseph @-@ Léonard ( born 1819 ) , an anonymous stillbirth ( 1823 ) , Marie Edwige ( born 1825 – died 1827 ) , Antoine ( born 1827 – died 1827 ) , <unk> ( born 1830 – died 1831 ) , and Marie <unk> ( born 1832 – died 1836 ) . 
 In 1822 , seeking more land in order to provide for their children 's inheritance , the Jetté family sold their farm under a staggered payment arrangement whereby they would not have the full payment for three years . While waiting for the payments to come through , the <unk> lived in <unk> , either in rented property or residing with relatives . Cadron @-@ Jetté , Jean @-@ Marie and their children were accompanied in the move by Rosalie 's parents and Rosalie 's sister Sophie . In 1823 they moved again to Saint Hyacinthe and in 1824 they bought land there from a Charles Jarret . However , they later discovered the seller did not own the relevant land , leading in late 1826 or early 1827 to the repossession of the majority of the Jetté family 's property . Following this setback the family moved to Montreal , took residence in the borough of Saint @-@ Laurent , and joined the congregation of Saint @-@ Jacques Cathedral . 
 = = Widowhood = = 
 On June 14 , 1832 , Cadron @-@ Jetté 's husband Jean @-@ Marie died of cholera , one of many victims of that year 's cholera epidemic , leaving Cadron @-@ Jetté widowed . Cadron @-@ Jetté responded to her husband 's death by vowing to be in mourning , or wear black , for the remainder of her life . At that time , Cadron @-@ Jetté 's eldest two sons , Jean @-@ Marie and Pierre ( 20 and 17 years old , respectively ) , were employed as shoemakers , and the eldest daughter , Rose ( 19 ) was engaged ( and was married in July 1833 ) , while Cadron @-@ Jetté 's other four surviving children still required Cadron @-@ Jetté 's care , as did Cadron @-@ Jetté 's elderly mother . It was not until 1838 , following the death of Cadron @-@ Jetté 's mother and the maturity or death of her remaining children , that she found herself with time free to devote to charitable activities . 
 = = Hospice de Sainte @-@ Pélagie = = 
 Several sources describe an incident which purportedly had an influence on Cadron @-@ Jetté 's future career . Between 1830 and 1832 , while living in Montreal , Cadron @-@ Jetté was visited at her house in the middle of the night by a prostitute who was seeking asylum from two sailors with intentions of violence . Cadron @-@ Jetté hid the woman for the night in her cellar , fed her , and counselled her to change her way of life . Subsequently Cadron @-@ Jetté received a letter from the woman informing her the woman had emigrated to the United States and made positive changes to her life , including marriage . 
 In any case , during her time in Montreal , Cadron @-@ Jetté made the acquaintance of Ignace Bourget , Bishop of the Diocese of Montreal . She met Bourget through her attendance at Saint Jacques Cathedral , where he became her spiritual director . Cadron @-@ Jetté joined his <unk> du Très Saint et <unk> Coeur de Marie , a group formed by Bourget to pray for the conversion of sinners . Beginning in 1840 , Bourget began to call upon Cadron @-@ Jetté to find crisis accommodation for unwed mothers who had approached him for confession and help . This accommodation was to be secret , as unwed mothers carried a significant social stigma at the time and were often the targets of hostility , and it was to be " with a kind and prayerful woman " . Cadron @-@ Jetté undertook this work , and between 1840 and 1845 helped around 25 women during their pregnancy , childbirth , and recovery . She would often place the women with her ( now @-@ independent ) children , and sometimes offered the women accommodation in her own home . After the birth of each child , Cadron @-@ Jetté would take the newborn to be baptised at Montreal 's Notre Dame church , and stand as godmother for the child . 
 In 1845 , in response to growing demand brought about by Montreal 's burgeoning population , Bourget began an organised project to assist unwed mothers in need of crisis accommodation and medical care . Although the Grey Nuns had been doing work in this area since 1754 , their efforts were limited to the care of illegitimate newborns , and no services existed to aid the unwed mothers themselves . In addition , the work of the Grey Nuns did not address the rate of abortions and infanticides among unwed mothers , which was of concern to Bourget due to Roman Catholic Church prohibitions on these activities . Therefore , rather than partnering with an existing religious community for this project , Bourget hoped to create a new one " free of traditions or previous hampering ties " , and asked Rosalie Cadron @-@ Jetté to take a leading role . Cadron @-@ Jetté agreed , and on May 1 , 1845 she founded the Hospice Sainte @-@ Pélagie ( also known as the <unk> de Sainte @-@ Pélagie ) , operating out of the attic of a house on Saint @-@ Simon Street , Montreal , which her son Pierre had leased from a widow named Aurelie <unk> . The hospice derived its name from Saint Pelagia , a 5th @-@ century reformed courtesan who chose to martyr herself rather than be raped by soldiers , to whom the Hospice was blessed and dedicated by Bishop Bourget shortly after its inception . 
 Early on , conditions in the hospice were rudimentary , consisting only of a table , some chairs , a stove , and a few beds for the mothers ( called " penitents " ) , with Cadron @-@ Jetté herself sleeping on the floor . The attic could only be reached by a ladder on the exterior of the house and was not insulated . For this reason , Cadron @-@ Jetté 's new occupation was unpopular with her ( now mature ) children , who objected to the conditions of dire poverty in the Hospice and attempted to dissuade her from her new calling , on one occasion going so far as to begin moving her belongings out of the Hospice . Despite this , Cadron @-@ Jetté persevered , expanding the Hospice 's operations to provide accommodation for up to seven or eight women at a time , and , from July 1845 , taking on an additional caregiver . This caregiver was Sophie Raymond née <unk> , herself a widow , who in addition to helping with the mothers , undertook fundraising activities on behalf of the hospice . Through the combined efforts of Raymond and Bourget , the Hospice attracted the attentions of Antoine @-@ Olivier <unk> , a wealthy philanthropist , who provided money , food and firewood , and later contributed to the building of facilities for the Misericordia Sisters on Dorchester Boulevard . 
 On May 4 , 1846 , the hospice moved to an address on Wolfe Street in Faubourg Quebec owned by Jean @-@ Baptiste <unk> . The new premises consisted of two storeys plus an attic , with the Hospice occupying one side of the house and the owner occupying the other . The expanded space provided room for a small chapel featuring Stations of the Cross , where Mass was held twice weekly . It also allowed for the addition of three extra staff at the Hospice , including a Mrs <unk> , a midwife . During the Hospice 's second year of operation it was host to 33 pregnant women and saw the birth of 25 infants . 
 On July 26 , 1846 , Bishop Bourget unilaterally opened the <unk> of the Saint @-@ Pélagie Community , and placed the assembled female staff of the Hospice as novices within that program . This effectively established the Hospice de Saint @-@ Pélagie as a religious community , of which Bourget proclaimed Sophie Raymond to be the superior . It also allowed for women to join the community as <unk> , with the aim of eventually taking religious vows . Bourget designated himself spiritual and canonical director of the novitiate , and delegated a priest , the Abbé Antoine Rey , to be Director of the Hospice . Later that year at the direction of Coadjutor Bishop Jean @-@ Charles Prince ( later Bishop of Saint @-@ Hyacinth ) the Wolfe Street premises were expanded through the acquisition of the first floor adjacent to the hospice . 
 On September 17 , 1846 , <unk> Malo @-@ Galipeau joined the community , bringing with her a large endowment of funds left to her by her late husband , which substantially enriched the community . Despite these additional funds the women of the Hospice were still forced to do odd jobs outside the hospice to make ends meet . Cadron @-@ Jetté during this time undertook occasional work as a shoemaker . Elections were held within the community on November 6 , 1846 , with the result of Cadron @-@ Jetté being appointed as the new superior for a period of one year , with Malo @-@ Galipeau named as her assistant . From December 1 , 1846 , the women of the community began wearing a religious habit at the direction of Bishop Prince . 
 In early 1847 , Jean @-@ Baptiste <unk> , owner of the Wolfe Street premises , notified Cadron @-@ Jetté and the Hospice that he was evicting them , citing concern for his reputation . After exhaustive enquiries , a new premises was located on the corner of Sainte @-@ Catherine and Saint @-@ André streets , provided by John <unk> , a Montreal businessman , at a rent of 60 dollars a year . On April 26 , 1847 the Hospice moved to the new site . 
 A typhus epidemic swept Montreal in late 1847 and Montreal 's religious communities , including Cadron @-@ Jetté and the staff of the hospice , were called upon by Bishop Bourget to assist in combating it . The hospice 's chaplain and director , Antoine Rey , and its midwife , Madame <unk> , were among the nine priests and 13 Religious Sisters of Montreal who were killed by the disease . One of the hospice 's penitents also died due to the disease . Bishop Bourget subsequently named Father <unk> Pilon as Rey 's replacement as Director of the Hospice . 
 = = Sisters of Misericorde = = 
 On January 16 , 1848 , at the age of 53 , Cadron @-@ Jetté took Religious vows , along with seven other women who had worked with her at the Hospice . Those in attendance as observers at the profession ceremony included Bishop Ignace Bourget , and Émilie Gamelin , under whose leadership the Sisters of Providence had been founded five years previously . Along with her vows Cadron @-@ Jetté took the religious name <unk> de la Nativité ( Sister Nativity ) , a reference to the role of the Virgin Mary in the birthing of Christ . Together , the eight women of the Hospice formed the Institute of the Misericordia Sisters . 
 Bourget petitioned the Church of Montreal to recognise the Institute and that recognition was granted . The institute received the ecclesiastical mandate to " live the mercy of Jesus the Saviour with girls and women in a situation of maternity out of wedlock and their children , and with the mothers of families who are having a difficult time with their maternity . " The Institute was the first religious community in Canada to receive such a mission . The vows of the Misericordia Sisters were the traditional vows of poverty , chastity and obedience , together with a fourth vow , being that of " assisting in their labour fallen girls and women " , with a consequence to " form a corps of midwives " . 
 On January 17 , 1848 , elections were held to determine leadership of the new community , and at the first election <unk> Malo @-@ Galipeau ( now Sister Sainte @-@ Jeanne @-@ de @-@ Chantal ) was appointed mother superior , and Cadron @-@ Jetté made councillor , with responsibility for the infirmary . This position left Cadron @-@ Jetté free to undertake care for the ill and disadvantaged , including home visits and visits to prisons . Sources , including Grégoire 's 2007 book Rosalie Cadron @-@ Jetté . A Story of Courage and Compassion , suggest Cadron @-@ Jetté may have been offered the position of mother superior , but declined it . 
 Beginning January 17 , 1848 , the eight founders of the Misericorde Sisters , including Cadron @-@ Jetté , commenced practical training in midwifery under Dr Eugène @-@ Hercule <unk> , a young obstetrician . The objective of the training was to better prepare the sisters to meet the obligations of their fourth vow . The training lasted for 18 months and concluded with an examination before two members of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Lower Canada , with the result that on July 12 , 1849 , the women received formal certificates of midwifery . It is most likely during this period or the years immediately following that Cadron @-@ Jetté learned to read and write . 
 In 1849 Malo @-@ Galipeau was again elected Mother Superior with Cadron @-@ Jetté being given the position of assistant . Around this time the relationship between the two women became strained . Despite the election result Malo @-@ Galipeau did not bestow formal titles on Cadron @-@ Jetté and is recorded as referring to Cadron @-@ Jetté disrespectfully as " Nativity " ( a short form of her religious name ) and on at least one occasion " fool " . Malo @-@ Galipeau on several occasions during this period reprimanded Cadron @-@ Jetté for decisions Cadron @-@ Jetté had made in discharge of her formal responsibilities , and imposed punishments , including barring Cadron @-@ Jetté from communion . The 1849 election was the last election to be held by the community until late 1858 . 
 The Misericorde Sisters were not well liked by the Montreal community . Throughout the early years of the Hospice de Sainte @-@ Pélagie and the Institute , the locations in which Jetté and the Sisters worked were kept secret , in order to protect the single mothers from public hostility towards prostitutes and unwed mothers . On some occasions when the Sisters brought newborns to church for baptism , garbage was thrown at them . People in prayer were reported to leave when the Sisters would enter the church . 
 The Sisters faced controversy not only from public opinion , but also within the medical profession . Initially the response of Montreal doctors was positive , and in 1850 the College of Physicians petitioned Bishop Bourget for permission to send students to the Hospice de Sainte @-@ Pélagie for training , which Bourget granted over the objections of the Sisters . However , friction arose between the Sisters and the students ; the Sisters did not want the students present ( a position shared by many of the unwed mothers ) , while the students were often contemptuous , rude , or dismissive towards their patients . Combined with the competency of the Misericorde Sisters , and their non @-@ profit mandate , this friction bloomed into hostility between the Sisters and Montreal physicians , who came to see the midwives as a professional threat . 
 On May 13 , 1851 , Antoine @-@ Olivier <unk> purchased land on the corner of Dorchester Boulevard and Saint @-@ André Street ( in Montreal ) for use by the Misericorde Sisters , and in December 1851 , following renovations to the two pre @-@ existing structures on the land , the Sisters moved to the new address . In 1853 work began on a Mother House ( or convent ) for the Institute . The <unk> was planned to be a multistory building , built of grey stone , financed by borrowed money . Plans for the <unk> had been drawn up in 1852 but the Montreal fires of July 8 , 1852 , which destroyed around 11 @,@ 000 homes along with the Saint @-@ Jacques Cathedral , had the result of delaying construction projects throughout the city . 
 In 1853 , Bourget met with the Sisters and questioned whether their fourth vow ( that of assisting in labour ) should be abandoned , with the consequence of the medical work of midwifery being done by physicians and lay midwives . Bourget 's concerns stemmed both from pressure and criticism from the Montreal medical community , and from a desire to expand the membership of the Sisters , as he feared potential candidates would be deterred by the necessity of learning and practicing the craft of midwifery . Cadron @-@ Jetté took the firm position that the vow should be retained , citing the general contempt held by physicians for the Sisters and their patients , the incompetence of the student doctors who were the Sisters ' primary competition , and the expressed preference of her patients to deal with the Sisters rather than doctors . Bourget retreated in the face of Cadron @-@ Jetté 's opposition and the matter was not raised again for some years . 
 In 1856 the City of Montreal donated a building located across the street from the convent for the use of the Misericordia Sisters . Called " Corporation House " it was put to use as a residence for the single mothers cared for by the Institute , with the mothers being charged rent by the Sisters while they stayed there . In late 1858 new elections were held by the Sisters , with Malo @-@ Galipeau reappointed as mother superior and Cadron @-@ Jetté given the position of Councillor . Around this time of these elections Bishop Bourget also gave the Sisters permission to baptise children at the Hospice , rather than take them to Notre Dame Cathedral for baptism , which was significant as by 1858 the Sisters were supervising around 137 births per year , each requiring a trip to the Cathedral for baptism . 
 By 1858 , Malo @-@ Galipeau had become widely recognised as foundress of the Misericordia Sisters , partly due to her role as Mother Superior and partly due to the endowment she had brought to the community upon her arrival . This understanding was reflected in published works of the time , including a souvenir album prepared by the City of Montreal in 1853 . However , during Bourget 's visit to the Institute in late 1858 , he made a speech to the assembled community confirming that in the eyes of himself and of the Church , Cadron @-@ Jetté should receive credit as the foundress of the congregation . He also bestowed upon Cadron @-@ Jetté the title of Mother ( such that her religious name became Mother Mary of the Nativity , or Mère de la Nativité ) and confirmed that she was second in authority only to the current Mother Superior of the community . 
 For some years , beginning prior to 1853 , the Institute had been taking in what were called " <unk> " or " <unk> " , and in 1859 this practice was formally recognised with the Magdalens made a secondary order of the Misericordia Sisters . The practice of taking in Magdalens followed a tradition originating in Europe , where religious orders would take in " <unk> " or " penitents " and place them under the protection of Mary Magdalene , a famous reformed sinner of Roman Catholic tradition , and from whom they took the name . In the case of the Misericordia Sisters , Magdalens were recruited from those unwed mothers who did not wish to leave the care of the sisters even after recovering from giving birth . They were allowed to take religious vows and live within the Misericordia Sisters community , obeying particular rules of dedication to contemplation . During the time the program lasted , about 1 % to 1 @.@ 5 % of mothers helped by the Institute stayed on as Magdalens . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 By 1859 , Rosalie Cadron @-@ Jetté 's health was worsening significantly . Information about the particular conditions she was afflicted with is contradictory . Testimony from Cadron @-@ Jetté 's family suggests that Cadron @-@ Jetté had become ill when she was 36 years old and never fully recovered . Other sources suggest generalised edema , known at the time as dropsy , while still others diagnose her with chronic nephritis , known at the time as Bright 's disease , which worsened over the following years . Symptoms observed in Cadron @-@ Jetté by her contemporaries included difficulty breathing , almost constant coughing , fits of breathlessness while standing and at rest , and swollen legs displaying open sores . 
 In any case , from around 1859 , due to declining health , Cadron @-@ Jetté ceased her work as a midwife , and from 1862 stopped making house visits to care for the ill . As the convent did not yet have an infirmary , she spent most of her days during this time in the convent 's dormitory , until 1861 , when at Bishop Bourget 's request a private room was prepared for Cadron @-@ Jetté by Malo @-@ Galipeau . In 1863 , Cadron @-@ Jetté , by then bedridden , was moved to a room adjoining the convent 's newly constructed chapel . 
 Advised of her failing health , Bishop Ignace Bourget visited Cadron @-@ Jetté on April 4 , 1864 , and administered to her the last rites . Rosalie Cadron @-@ Jetté died shortly thereafter , during the early hours of April 5 , 1864 . Her death was witnessed by Sister Marie @-@ des @-@ Saints @-@ Anges , who said this of the occasion : " I witnessed her blessed death . I was sitting vigil with our good sister Sainte @-@ <unk> . Around 2 a.m. she made the sign of the cross and asked us to recite the Litanies of the Virgin Mary ; then she arranged herself as if to prepare for sleep , then in a high pitched voice she said : O my Jesus ! Then I noticed she was getting weaker ; we brought the light closer to her and realized she had already passed over to a better life . " 
 Several unexplained incidents are associated with Cadron @-@ Jetté 's death . According to Hélène Grégoire 's 2007 book Rosalie Cadron @-@ Jetté . A Story of Courage and Compassion , at the moment of Cadron @-@ Jetté 's death an " unknown , elderly sister " holding a lantern was observed by women in the Magdalens ' dormitory . The " elderly sister " is recorded as addressing one of the Magdalens who was ill and telling her that " if she is very brave and prays with confidence , she will be healed " . The unknown sister then left the dormitory . Grégoire also claims that the other Sisters were mysteriously awakened during the night of Cadron @-@ Jetté 's death , and that following Cadron @-@ Jetté 's death the wounds on Cadron @-@ Jetté 's legs were observed to be inexplicably healed over . 
 A funeral was held for Cadron @-@ Jetté on April 8 , 1864 at the chapel of the Misericordia Sisters , with Bishop Bourget and several dignitaries of the Church of Montreal in attendance . At the time of her death , the Institute of Misericordia Sisters comprised 33 professed religious , 11 novices and <unk> , and 25 <unk> and other women . 
 = = Cause for canonization = = 
 In 1879 , Ignace Bourget suggested to Sister St @-@ Thérèse de Jésus ( then mother superior of the Misericordia Sisters ) that she gather testimonials from Cadron @-@ Jetté 's contemporaries for use in a possible future canonization cause .

 = Newton 's theorem of revolving orbits = 
 In classical mechanics , Newton 's theorem of revolving orbits identifies the type of central force needed to multiply the angular speed of a particle by a factor k without affecting its radial motion ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . Newton applied his theorem to understanding the overall rotation of orbits ( apsidal precession , Figure 3 ) that is observed for the Moon and planets . The term " radial motion " signifies the motion towards or away from the center of force , whereas the angular motion is perpendicular to the radial motion . 
 Isaac Newton derived this theorem in Propositions 43 – 45 of Book I of his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica , first published in 1687 . In Proposition 43 , he showed that the added force must be a central force , one whose magnitude depends only upon the distance r between the particle and a point fixed in space ( the center ) . In Proposition 44 , he derived a formula for the force , showing that it was an inverse @-@ cube force , one that varies as the inverse cube of r . In Proposition 45 Newton extended his theorem to arbitrary central forces by assuming that the particle moved in nearly circular orbit . 
 As noted by astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in his 1995 commentary on Newton 's Principia , this theorem remained largely unknown and undeveloped for over three centuries . Since 1997 , the theorem has been studied by Donald Lynden @-@ Bell and collaborators . Its first exact extension came in 2000 with the work of Mahomed and Vawda . 
 = = Historical context = = 
 The motion of astronomical bodies has been studied systematically for thousands of years . The stars were observed to rotate uniformly , always maintaining the same relative positions to one another . However , other bodies were observed to wander against the background of the fixed stars ; most such bodies were called planets after the Greek word " <unk> " ( <unk> ) for " wanderers " . Although they generally move in the same direction along a path across the sky ( the ecliptic ) , individual planets sometimes reverse their direction briefly , exhibiting retrograde motion . 
 To describe this forward @-@ and @-@ backward motion , Apollonius of Perga ( c . 262 – c . 190 BC ) developed the concept of deferents and epicycles , according to which the planets are carried on rotating circles that are themselves carried on other rotating circles , and so on . Any orbit can be described with a sufficient number of judiciously chosen epicycles , since this approach corresponds to a modern Fourier transform . Roughly 350 years later , Claudius Ptolemaeus published his Almagest , in which he developed this system to match the best astronomical observations of his era . To explain the epicycles , Ptolemy adopted the geocentric cosmology of Aristotle , according to which planets were confined to concentric rotating spheres . This model of the universe was authoritative for nearly 1500 years . 
 The modern understanding of planetary motion arose from the combined efforts of astronomer Tycho Brahe and physicist Johannes Kepler in the 16th century . Tycho is credited with extremely accurate measurements of planetary motions , from which Kepler was able to derive his laws of planetary motion . According to these laws , planets move on ellipses ( not epicycles ) about the Sun ( not the Earth ) . Kepler 's second and third laws make specific quantitative predictions : planets sweep out equal areas in equal time , and the square of their orbital periods equals a fixed constant times the cube of their semi @-@ major axis . Subsequent observations of the planetary orbits showed that the long axis of the ellipse ( the so @-@ called line of apsides ) rotates gradually with time ; this rotation is known as apsidal precession . The apses of an orbit are the points at which the orbiting body is closest or furthest away from the attracting center ; for planets orbiting the Sun , the apses correspond to the perihelion ( closest ) and aphelion ( furthest ) . 
 With the publication of his Principia roughly eighty years later ( 1687 ) , Isaac Newton provided a physical theory that accounted for all three of Kepler 's laws , a theory based on Newton 's laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation . In particular , Newton proposed that the gravitational force between any two bodies was a central force F ( r ) that varied as the inverse square of the distance r between them . Arguing from his laws of motion , Newton showed that the orbit of any particle acted upon by one such force is always a conic section , specifically an ellipse if it does not go to infinity . However , this conclusion holds only when two bodies are present ( the two @-@ body problem ) ; the motion of three bodies or more acting under their mutual gravitation ( the n @-@ body problem ) remained unsolved for centuries after Newton , although solutions to a few special cases were discovered . Newton proposed that the orbits of planets about the Sun are largely elliptical because the Sun 's gravitation is dominant ; to first approximation , the presence of the other planets can be ignored . By analogy , the elliptical orbit of the Moon about the Earth was dominated by the Earth 's gravity ; to first approximation , the Sun 's gravity and those of other bodies of the Solar System can be neglected . However , Newton stated that the gradual apsidal precession of the planetary and lunar orbits was due to the effects of these neglected interactions ; in particular , he stated that the precession of the Moon 's orbit was due to the perturbing effects of gravitational interactions with the Sun . 
 Newton 's theorem of revolving orbits was his first attempt to understand apsidal precession quantitatively . According to this theorem , the addition of a particular type of central force — the inverse @-@ cube force — can produce a rotating orbit ; the angular speed is multiplied by a factor k , whereas the radial motion is left unchanged . However , this theorem is restricted to a specific type of force that may not be relevant ; several perturbing inverse @-@ square interactions ( such as those of other planets ) seem unlikely to sum exactly to an inverse @-@ cube force . To make his theorem applicable to other types of forces , Newton found the best approximation of an arbitrary central force F ( r ) to an inverse @-@ cube potential in the limit of nearly circular orbits , that is , elliptical orbits of low eccentricity , as is indeed true for most orbits in the Solar System . To find this approximation , Newton developed an infinite series that can be viewed as the forerunner of the Taylor expansion . This approximation allowed Newton to estimate the rate of precession for arbitrary central forces . Newton applied this approximation to test models of the force causing the apsidal precession of the Moon 's orbit . However , the problem of the Moon 's motion is <unk> complex , and Newton never published an accurate gravitational model of the Moon 's apsidal precession . After a more accurate model by Clairaut in 1747 , analytical models of the Moon 's motion were developed in the late 19th century by Hill , Brown , and Delaunay . 
 However , Newton 's theorem is more general than merely explaining apsidal precession . It describes the effects of adding an inverse @-@ cube force to any central force F ( r ) , not only to inverse @-@ square forces such as Newton 's law of universal gravitation and Coulomb 's law . Newton 's theorem simplifies orbital problems in classical mechanics by eliminating inverse @-@ cube forces from consideration . The radial and angular motions , r ( t ) and θ1 ( t ) , can be calculated without the inverse @-@ cube force ; afterwards , its effect can be calculated by multiplying the angular speed of the particle 
 <formula> 
 = = Mathematical statement = = 
 Consider a particle moving under an arbitrary central force F1 ( r ) whose magnitude depends only on the distance r between the particle and a fixed center . Since the motion of a particle under a central force always lies in a plane , the position of the particle can be described by polar coordinates ( r , θ1 ) , the radius and angle of the particle relative to the center of force ( Figure 1 ) . Both of these coordinates , r ( t ) and θ1 ( t ) , change with time t as the particle moves . 
 Imagine a second particle with the same mass m and with the same radial motion r ( t ) , but one whose angular speed is k times faster than that of the first particle . In other words , the azimuthal angles of the two particles are related by the equation θ2 ( t ) = k θ1 ( t ) . Newton showed that the motion of the second particle can be produced by adding an inverse @-@ cube central force to whatever force F1 ( r ) acts on the first particle 
 <formula> 
 where L1 is the magnitude of the first particle 's angular momentum , which is a constant of motion ( conserved ) for central forces . 
 If k2 is greater than one , F2 − F1 is a negative number ; thus , the added inverse @-@ cube force is attractive , as observed in the green planet of Figures 1 – 4 and 9 . By contrast , if k2 is less than one , F2 − F1 is a positive number ; the added inverse @-@ cube force is repulsive , as observed in the green planet of Figures 5 and 10 , and in the red planet of Figures 4 and 5 . 
 = = = Alteration of the particle path = = = 
 The addition of such an inverse @-@ cube force also changes the path followed by the particle . The path of the particle ignores the time dependencies of the radial and angular motions , such as r ( t ) and θ1 ( t ) ; rather , it relates the radius and angle variables to one another . For this purpose , the angle variable is unrestricted and can increase indefinitely as the particle revolves around the central point multiple times . For example , if the particle revolves twice about the central point and returns to its starting position , its final angle is not the same as its initial angle ; rather , it has increased by 2 × 360 ° 
 = 720 ° . Formally , the angle variable is defined as the integral of the angular speed 
 <formula> 
 A similar definition holds for θ2 , the angle of the second particle . 
 If the path of the first particle is described in the form r = 
 g ( θ1 ) , the path of the second particle is given by the function r 
 = g ( θ2 / k ) , since θ2 = 
 k θ1 . For example , let the path of the first particle be an ellipse 
 <formula> 
 where A and B are constants ; then , the path of the second particle is given by 
 <formula> 
 = = Orbital precession = = 
 If k is close , but not equal , to one , the second orbit resembles the first , but revolves gradually about the center of force ; this is known as orbital precession ( Figure 3 ) . If k is greater than one , the orbit precesses in the same direction as the orbit ( Figure 3 ) ; if k is less than one , the orbit precesses in the opposite direction . 
 Although the orbit in Figure 3 may seem to rotate uniformly , i.e. , at a constant angular speed , this is true only for circular orbits . If the orbit rotates at an angular speed Ω , the angular speed of the second particle is faster or slower than that of the first particle by Ω ; in other words , the angular speeds would satisfy the equation ω2 
 = ω1 + Ω . However , Newton 's theorem of revolving orbits states that the angular speeds are related by multiplication : ω2 = 
 <unk> , where k is a constant . Combining these two equations shows that the angular speed of the precession equals Ω = ( k − 1 ) ω1 . Hence , Ω is constant only if ω1 is constant . According to the conservation of angular momentum , ω1 changes with the radius r 
 <formula> 
 where m and L1 are the first particle 's mass and angular momentum , respectively , both of which are constant . Hence , ω1 is constant only if the radius r is constant , i.e. , when the orbit is a circle . However , in that case , the orbit does not change as it precesses . 
 = = Illustrative example : Cotes 's spirals = = 
 The simplest illustration of Newton 's theorem occurs when there is no initial force , i.e. , F1 ( r ) 
 = 0 . In this case , the first particle is stationary or travels in a straight line . If it travels in a straight line that does not pass through the origin ( blue line in Figure 6 ) the equation for such a line may be written in the polar coordinates ( r , θ1 ) as 
 <formula> 
 where θ0 is the angle at which the distance is minimized ( Figure 6 ) . The distance r begins at infinity ( when θ1 – θ0 = 
 − 90 ° ) , and decreases gradually until θ1 – θ0 
 = 0 ° , when the distance reaches a minimum , then gradually increases again to infinity at θ1 – θ0 = 
 90 ° . The minimum distance b is the impact parameter , which is defined as the length of the perpendicular from the fixed center to the line of motion . The same radial motion is possible when an inverse @-@ cube central force is added . 
 An inverse @-@ cube central force F2 ( r ) has the form 
 <formula> 
 where the numerator μ may be positive ( repulsive ) or negative ( attractive ) . If such an inverse @-@ cube force is introduced , Newton 's theorem says that the corresponding solutions have a shape called Cotes 's spirals . These are curves defined by the equation 
 <formula> 
 where the constant k equals 
 <formula> 
 When the right @-@ hand side of the equation is a positive real number , the solution corresponds to an <unk> . When the argument θ1 – θ0 equals ± 90 ° × k , the cosine goes to zero and the radius goes to infinity . Thus , when k is less than one , the range of allowed angles becomes small and the force is repulsive ( red curve on right in Figure 7 ) . On the other hand , when k is greater than one , the range of allowed angles increases , corresponding to an attractive force ( green , cyan and blue curves on left in Figure 7 ) ; the orbit of the particle can even wrap around the center several times . The possible values of the parameter k may range from zero to infinity , which corresponds to values of μ ranging from negative infinity up to the positive upper limit , L12 / m . Thus , for all attractive inverse @-@ cube forces ( negative μ ) there is a corresponding <unk> orbit , as for some repulsive ones ( μ < L12 / m ) , as illustrated in Figure 7 . Stronger repulsive forces correspond to a faster linear motion . 
 One of the other solution types is given in terms of the hyperbolic cosine : 
 <formula> 
 where the constant λ satisfies 
 <formula> 
 This form of Cotes 's spirals corresponds to one of the two Poinsot 's spirals ( Figure 8 ) . The possible values of λ range from zero to infinity , which corresponds to values of μ greater than the positive number L12 / m . Thus , Poinsot spiral motion only occurs for repulsive inverse @-@ cube central forces , and applies in the case that L is not too large for the given μ . 
 Taking the limit of k or λ going to zero yields the third form of a Cotes 's spiral , the so @-@ called reciprocal spiral or hyperbolic spiral , as a solution 
 <formula> 
 where A and ε are arbitrary constants . Such curves result when the strength μ of the repulsive force exactly balances the angular momentum @-@ mass term 
 <formula> 
 = = Closed orbits and inverse @-@ cube central forces = = 
 Two types of central forces — those that increase linearly with distance , F 
 = Cr , such as Hooke 's law , and inverse @-@ square forces , F = 
 C / r2 , such as Newton 's law of universal gravitation and Coulomb 's law — have a very unusual property . A particle moving under either type of force always returns to its starting place with its initial velocity , provided that it lacks sufficient energy to move out to infinity . In other words , the path of a bound particle is always closed and its motion repeats indefinitely , no matter what its initial position or velocity . As shown by Bertrand 's theorem , this property is not true for other types of forces ; in general , a particle will not return to its starting point with the same velocity . 
 However , Newton 's theorem shows that an inverse @-@ cubic force may be applied to a particle moving under a linear or inverse @-@ square force such that its orbit remains closed , provided that k equals a rational number . ( A number is called " rational " if it can be written as a fraction m / n , where m and n are integers . ) In such cases , the addition of the inverse @-@ cubic force causes the particle to complete m rotations about the center of force in the same time that the original particle completes n rotations . This method for producing closed orbits does not violate Bertrand 's theorem , because the added inverse @-@ cubic force depends on the initial velocity of the particle . 
 Harmonic and subharmonic orbits are special types of such closed orbits . A closed trajectory is called a harmonic orbit if k is an integer , i.e. , if n 
 = 1 in the formula k = 
 m / n . For example , if k 
 = 3 ( green planet in Figures 1 and 4 , green orbit in Figure 9 ) , the resulting orbit is the third harmonic of the original orbit . Conversely , the closed trajectory is called a subharmonic orbit if k is the inverse of an integer , i.e. , if m = 
 1 in the formula k 
 = m / n . For example , if k = 
 1 / 3 ( green planet in Figure 5 , green orbit in Figure 10 ) , the resulting orbit is called the third subharmonic of the original orbit . Although such orbits are unlikely to occur in nature , they are helpful for illustrating Newton 's theorem . 
 = = Limit of nearly circular orbits = = 
 In Proposition 45 of his Principia , Newton applies his theorem of revolving orbits to develop a method for finding the force laws that govern the motions of planets . Johannes Kepler had noted that the orbits of most planets and the Moon seemed to be ellipses , and the long axis of those ellipses can determined accurately from astronomical measurements . The long axis is defined as the line connecting the positions of minimum and maximum distances to the central point , i.e. , the line connecting the two apses . For illustration , the long axis of the planet Mercury is defined as the line through its successive positions of perihelion and aphelion . Over time , the long axis of most orbiting bodies rotates gradually , generally no more than a few degrees per complete revolution , because of gravitational perturbations from other bodies , oblateness in the attracting body , general relativistic effects , and other effects . Newton 's method uses this apsidal precession as a sensitive probe of the type of force being applied to the planets . 
 Newton 's theorem describes only the effects of adding an inverse @-@ cube central force . However , Newton extends his theorem to an arbitrary central forces F ( r ) by restricting his attention to orbits that are nearly circular , such as ellipses with low orbital eccentricity ( ε ≤ 0 @.@ 1 ) , which is true of seven of the eight planetary orbits in the solar system . Newton also applied his theorem to the planet Mercury , which has an eccentricity ε of roughly 0 @.@ 21 , and suggested that it may pertain to Halley 's comet , whose orbit has an eccentricity of roughly 0 @.@ 97 . 
 A qualitative justification for this extrapolation of his method has been suggested by Valluri , Wilson and Harper . According to their argument , Newton considered the apsidal precession angle α ( the angle between the vectors of successive minimum and maximum distance from the center ) to be a smooth , continuous function of the orbital eccentricity ε . For the inverse @-@ square force , α equals 180 ° ; the vectors to the positions of minimum and maximum distances lie on the same line . If α is initially not 180 ° at low ε ( quasi @-@ circular orbits ) then , in general , α will equal 180 ° only for isolated values of ε ; a randomly chosen value of ε would be very unlikely to give α = 180 ° . Therefore , the observed slow rotation of the apsides of planetary orbits suggest that the force of gravity is an inverse @-@ square law . 
 = = = Quantitative formula = = = 
 To simplify the equations , Newton writes F ( r ) in terms of a new function C ( r ) 
 <formula> 
 where R is the average radius of the nearly circular orbit . Newton expands C ( r ) in a series — now known as a Taylor expansion — in powers of the distance r , one of the first appearances of such a series . By equating the resulting inverse @-@ cube force term with the inverse @-@ cube force for revolving orbits , Newton derives an equivalent angular scaling factor k for nearly circular orbits 
 <formula> 
 In other words , the application of an arbitrary central force F ( r ) to a nearly circular elliptical orbit can accelerate the angular motion by the factor k without affecting the radial motion significantly . If an elliptical orbit is stationary , the particle rotates about the center of force by 180 ° as it moves from one end of the long axis to the other ( the two apses ) . Thus , the corresponding apsidal angle α for a general central force equals k × 180 ° , using the general law θ2 = k θ1 . 
 = = = Examples = = = 
 Newton illustrates his formula with three examples . In the first two , the central force is a power law , F ( r ) 
 = rn − 3 and , hence , C ( r ) is proportional to rn . The formula above indicates that the angular motion is multiplied by a factor k = 
 1 / √ n , so that the apsidal angle α equals 180 ° / √ n . 
 This angular scaling can be seen in the apsidal precession , i.e. , in the gradual rotation of the long axis of the ellipse ( Figure 3 ) . As noted above , the orbit as a whole rotates with a mean angular speed Ω = ( k − 1 ) ω , where ω equals the mean angular speed of the particle about the stationary ellipse . If the particle requires a time T to move from one apse to the other , this implies that , in the same time , the long axis will rotate by an angle β 
 = <unk> = 
 ( k − 1 ) <unk> 
 = ( k − 1 ) × 180 ° . For an inverse @-@ square law such as Newton 's law of universal gravitation , where n equals 1 , there is no angular scaling ( k = 
 1 ) , the apsidal angle α is 180 ° , and the elliptical orbit is stationary ( Ω 
 = β = 
 0 ) . 
 As a final illustration , Newton considers a sum of two power laws 
 <formula> 
 which multiplies the angular speed by a factor 
 <formula> 
 Newton applies both of these formulae ( the power law and sum of two power laws ) to examine the apsidal precession of the Moon 's orbit . 
 = = Precession of the Moon 's orbit = = 
 The motion of the Moon can be measured accurately , and is noticeably more complex than that of the planets . The ancient Greek astronomers , Hipparchus and Ptolemy , had noted several periodic variations in the Moon 's orbit , such as small oscillations in its orbital eccentricity and the inclination of its orbit to the plane of the ecliptic . These oscillations generally occur on a once @-@ monthly or twice @-@ monthly time @-@ scale . The line of its apses precesses gradually with a period of roughly 8 @.@ 85 years , while its line of nodes turns a full circle in roughly double that time , 18 @.@ 6 years . This accounts for the roughly 18 @-@ year periodicity of eclipses , the so @-@ called Saros cycle . However , both lines experience small fluctuations in their motion , again on the monthly time @-@ scale . 
 In 1673 , Jeremiah Horrocks published a reasonably accurate model of the Moon 's motion in which the Moon was assumed to follow a precessing elliptical orbit . A sufficiently accurate and simple method for predicting the Moon 's motion would have solved the navigational problem of determining a ship 's longitude ; in Newton 's time , the goal was to predict the Moon 's position to 2 ' ( two arc @-@ minutes ) , which would correspond to a 1 ° error in terrestrial longitude . Horrocks ' model predicted the lunar position with errors no more than 10 arc @-@ minutes ; for comparison , the diameter of the Moon is roughly 30 arc @-@ minutes . 
 Newton used his theorem of revolving orbits in two ways to account for the apsidal precession of the Moon . First , he showed that the Moon 's observed apsidal precession could be accounted for by changing the force law of gravity from an inverse @-@ square law to a power law in which the exponent was 2 + 4 / 243 ( roughly 2 @.@ <unk> ) 
 <formula> 
 In 1894 , Asaph Hall adopted this approach of modifying the exponent in the inverse @-@ square law slightly to explain an anomalous orbital precession of the planet Mercury , which had been observed in 1859 by Urbain Le Verrier . Ironically , Hall 's theory was ruled out by careful astronomical observations of the Moon . The currently accepted explanation for this precession involves the theory of general relativity , which ( to first approximation ) adds an inverse @-@ quartic force , i.e. , one that varies as the inverse fourth power of distance . 
 As a second approach to explaining the Moon 's precession , Newton suggested that the perturbing influence of the Sun on the Moon 's motion might be approximately equivalent to an additional linear force 
 <formula> 
 The first term corresponds to the gravitational attraction between the Moon and the Earth , where r is the Moon 's distance from the Earth . The second term , so Newton reasoned , might represent the average perturbing force of the Sun 's gravity of the Earth @-@ Moon system . Such a force law could also result if the Earth were surrounded by a spherical dust cloud of uniform density . Using the formula for k for nearly circular orbits , and estimates of A and B , Newton showed that this force law could not account for the Moon 's precession , since the predicted apsidal angle α was ( ≈ 180 @.@ 76 ° ) rather than the observed α ( ≈ 181 @.@ 525 ° ) . For every revolution , the long axis would rotate 1 @.@ 5 ° , roughly half of the observed 3 @.@ 0 ° 
 = = Generalization = = 
 Isaac Newton first published his theorem in 1687 , as Propositions 43 – 45 of Book I of his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica . However , as astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar noted in his 1995 commentary on Newton 's Principia , the theorem remained largely unknown and undeveloped for over three centuries . 
 The first generalization of Newton 's theorem was discovered by Mahomed and Vawda in 2000 . As Newton did , they assumed that the angular motion of the second particle was k times faster than that of the first particle , θ2 
 = k θ1 . In contrast to Newton , however , Mahomed and Vawda did not require that the radial motion of the two particles be the same , r1 = 
 r2 . Rather , they required that the inverse radii be related by a linear equation 
 <formula> 
 This transformation of the variables changes the path of the particle . If the path of the first particle is written r1 
 = g ( θ1 ) , the second particle 's path can be written as 
 <formula> 
 If the motion of the first particle is produced by a central force F1 ( r ) , Mahomed and Vawda showed that the motion of the second particle can be produced by the following force 
 <formula> 
 According to this equation , the second force F2 ( r ) is obtained by scaling the first force and changing its argument , as well as by adding inverse @-@ square and inverse @-@ cube central forces . 
 For comparison , Newton 's theorem of revolving orbits corresponds to the case a = 
 1 and b 
 = 0 , so that r1 = 
 r2 . In this case , the original force is not scaled , and its argument is unchanged ; the inverse @-@ cube force is added , but the inverse @-@ square term is not . Also , the path of the second particle is r2 = g ( θ2 / k ) , consistent with the formula given above . 
 = = Derivations = = 
 = = = Newton 's derivation = = = 
 Newton 's derivation is found in Section IX of his Principia , specifically Propositions 43 – 45 . His derivations of these Propositions are based largely on geometry . 
 Proposition 43 ; Problem 30 
 It is required to make a body move in a curve that revolves about the center of force in the same manner as another body in the same curve at rest . 
 Newton 's derivation of Proposition 43 depends on his Proposition 2 , derived earlier in the Principia . Proposition 2 provides a geometrical test for whether the net force acting on a point mass ( a particle ) is a central force . Newton showed that a force is central if and only if the particle sweeps out equal areas in equal times as measured from the center . 
 Newton 's derivation begins with a particle moving under an arbitrary central force F1 ( r ) ; the motion of this particle under this force is described by its radius r ( t ) from the center as a function of time , and also its angle θ1 ( t ) . In an infinitesimal time dt , the particle sweeps out an approximate right triangle whose area is 
 <formula> 
 Since the force acting on the particle is assumed to be a central force , the particle sweeps out equal angles in equal times , by Newton 's Proposition 2 . Expressed another way , the rate of sweeping out area is constant 
 <formula> 
 This constant areal velocity can be calculated as follows . At the <unk> and periapsis , the positions of closest and furthest distance from the attracting center , the velocity and radius vectors are perpendicular ; therefore , the angular momentum L1 per mass m of the particle ( written as h1 ) can be related to the rate of sweeping out areas 
 <formula> 
 Now consider a second particle whose orbit is identical in its radius , but whose angular variation is multiplied by a constant factor k 
 <formula> 
 The areal velocity of the second particle equals that of the first particle multiplied by the same factor k 
 <formula> 
 Since k is a constant , the second particle also sweeps out equal areas in equal times . Therefore , by Proposition 2 , the second particle is also acted upon by a central force F2 ( r ) . This is the conclusion of Proposition 43 . 
 Proposition 44 
 The difference of the forces , by which two bodies may be made to move equally , one in a fixed , the other in the same orbit revolving , varies inversely as the cube of their common altitudes . 
 To find the magnitude of F2 ( r ) from the original central force F1 ( r ) , Newton calculated their difference F2 ( r ) − F1 ( r ) using geometry and the definition of centripetal acceleration . In Proposition 44 of his Principia , he showed that the difference is proportional to the inverse cube of the radius , specifically by the formula given above , which Newtons writes in terms of the two constant areal velocities , h1 and h2 
 <formula> 
 Proposition 45 ; Problem 31 
 To find the motion of the apsides in orbits approaching very near to circles . 
 In this Proposition , Newton derives the consequences of his theorem of revolving orbits in the limit of nearly circular orbits . This approximation is generally valid for planetary orbits and the orbit of the Moon about the Earth . This approximation also allows Newton to consider a great variety of central force laws , not merely inverse @-@ square and inverse @-@ cube force laws .

 Modern derivations of Newton 's theorem have been published by Whittaker ( 1937 ) and Chandrasekhar ( 1995 ) . By assumption , the second angular speed is k times faster than the first

 = Mother and Child Reunion ( Degrassi : The Next Generation ) = 
 " Mother and Child Reunion " is the two @-@ part pilot episode of the Canadian teen drama television series Degrassi : The Next Generation , which premiered on October 14 , 2001 on the CTV Television Network . The episode was written by story editor Aaron Martin and series co @-@ creator / creative consultant Yan Moore , and directed by Bruce McDonald . As with the majority of Degrassi : The Next Generation episodes , " Mother and Child Reunion " takes its title from a pop song , " Mother and Child Reunion " , written and performed by Paul Simon . 
 Degrassi : The Next Generation is the fourth series in the fictional Degrassi universe created in 1979 . The preceding series , Degrassi High , ended in 1991 , although a television movie , School 's Out , aired in 1992 and wrapped up the storylines of the characters . " Mother and Child Reunion " reunited some of those characters in a ten @-@ year high school reunion , while also introducing a new generation of Degrassi Community School students : Emma Nelson , Manny Santos , J.T. Yorke and Toby Isaacs . 
 The episode received mixed reviews from the mass media , with the Ottawa Citizen saying that it offers " nothing new to viewers familiar with the groundbreaking preceding series " , and The Seattle Times saying it " soft @-@ pedals through the issues " , although the acting from the new generation of children was lauded as " stellar ... solid [ and ] believable " by Canoe.ca 's <unk> . It was nominated for two Gemini Awards and two Directors Guild of Canada Awards , winning in the " Outstanding Achievement in a Television Series – Children 's " category .

 Archie " Snake " Simpson ( played by Stefan Brogren ) , a former student of Degrassi High , and now teacher at Degrassi Community School , has arranged a mixed reunion for the classes of 1991 and 1992 . Spike Nelson ( Amanda Stepto ) , Caitlin Ryan ( Stacie Mistysyn ) , and Lucy Fernandez ( Anais Granofsky ) , who also attended Degrassi High , plan on attending and try to persuade Joey Jeremiah ( Pat Mastroianni ) to join them . Joey , however , is reticent as he is still dealing with his grief over the death of his wife . Along with Caitlin 's fiancé Keith ( Don McKellar ) , the five friends go out to a bar for the night , reminiscing about the past and discussing their present lives . 
 Spike 's daughter , Emma ( played by Miriam McDonald ) is told by her online boyfriend , Jordan , that he is coming to Toronto for a school field trip , and asks her if she would like to meet him for the first time . Her friends , Manny Santos ( Cassie Steele ) , J.T. Yorke ( Ryan Cooley ) and Toby Isaacs ( Jake Goldsbie ) warn her of the potential dangers of meeting somebody she only knows from the Internet , and tell her that he could be an Internet stalker , pointing out that schools do not take field trips in the middle of summer . However , Emma is undeterred , convinced that Jordan is just a normal boy with whom she shares the same interests .

 At the reunion party , Joey and Caitlin meet Alison Hunter ( Sara Holmes ) , another Degrassi High attendee . As the evening progresses , Joey overhears Keith and Alison flirting with each other and Keith reveals he does not want to marry Caitlin . When Joey confronts Keith , their argument turns into a physical altercation , and Alison has to tell Caitlin about Keith 's hesitance over getting married . Joey and Caitlin have a heart @-@ to @-@ heart discussion about their past and their relationships , and after ten years , finally make amends , while Wheels ( Neil Hope ) apologizes to Lucy for crippling her while driving drunk nine years ago . 
 While her mother attends the reunion , Emma visits Jordan at his hotel where she meets his teacher , Mr. Nystrom ( Jeff <unk> ) . He takes her up to Jordan 's hotel room but as they enter , Emma sees that it is completely empty except for a video camera which has been set up . She immediately becomes suspicious and tries to escape but Nystrom blocks her access to the bedroom door . She locks herself in the bathroom , and comes to the startling realization that Nystrom is Jordan . Nystrom apologizes and tells Emma he will let her go , but when she comes out of the bathroom he grabs and restrains her . 
 Unable to get in contact with Emma , Manny tells Toby and J. T. that she is afraid that Emma may have gone to meet Jordan . They hack into Emma 's email account and realize that Jordan has told her a number of lies . After discovering which hotel Emma is meeting Jordan at , they rush to the school to inform Spike . As Nystrom attempts to rape Emma , Spike and Snake arrive just in time to save her . Emma manages to break free from Nystrom and rushes out of the hotel room . Snake restrains Nystrom until the police arrive to take him away .

 Linda Schuyler had co @-@ created The Kids of Degrassi Street in 1979 with Kit Hood , and Yan Moore was a writer on that series . As the children grew up , the Degrassi franchise developed into Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High . In 1999 two episodes of <unk> , a CBC Television talk show aimed at teenagers , reunited some of the cast members from the series . At the same time , Schuyler and Moore were developing a new television drama . When the <unk> reunion episode proved to be popular , Schuyler and Moore wondered about reuniting the characters , too . As the months passed , they began thinking about what might have happened to the characters of Degrassi High and realized that the character Emma Nelson , born at the end of Degrassi Junior High 's second season , would soon be entering junior high school . Stephen Stohn , Schuyler 's husband suggested Degrassi : The Next Generation as the name for the new sequel series , borrowing the concept from Star Trek : The Next Generation , of which he was a fan . 
 The new series was offered a place on a number of television networks , with CTV and CBC ( the franchise 's former network ) vying as the top contenders . CTV won through , offering $ 10 million for a fifteen @-@ episode season . The project was greenlit in May 2000 , with the originally planned reunion episode serving as the pilot to the new series . CTV announced the new series at its annual press conference in June 2001 , and said the pilot would air in the fall . 
 In contrast to the previous Degrassi series , which were filmed on and around De Grassi Street in Riverdale , Toronto , Degrassi Junior High used Vincent Massey Public School , then known as Daisy Avenue Public School , as its primary filming location , and Centennial College was used in Degrassi High . Degrassi : The Next Generation is filmed at Epitome Pictures ' studios in North York , Toronto . A 100 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 9 @,@ 300 m2 ) former printing factory was converted in 1997 for Epitome , consisting of four soundstages and a backlot . The exterior of Degrassi Community School was located on the studio 's backlot , and used the same colours and glass pattern as Degrassi High 's Centennial College . 
 Production on " Mother and Child Reunion " began earlier than expected , as CTV initially planned to launch the series in January 2002 . At the eleventh hour the broadcaster decided to bring it forward to October 2001 to coincide with the back @-@ to @-@ school season . The episode was written by series co @-@ creator Moore , also credited as creative consultant , and script editor Aaron Martin . Co @-@ creator Schuyler , with her husband and Epitome Pictures partner Stohn , served as executive producers . The line producer was David Lowe . " Mother and Child Reunion " was directed by Bruce McDonald , who had previously directed the films Roadkill ( 1989 ) , Highway 61 ( 1991 ) , Hard Core Logo ( 1996 ) , and the television series Queer As Folk ( 2001 – 2005 ) . Epitome Pictures sought funding from the Government of Canada , through its two Crown corporations , Telefilm Canada and the Canadian Television Fund , which provide financial support to Canadian audiovisual productions . Filming began on July 3 , before Epitome Pictures could finalize their contracts with Telefilm and the Television Fund . Other financial contributors included Royal Bank of Canada , Cogeco , Shaw Communications , and Bell Canada . 
 To appeal to Degrassi 's established audience , a number of references to events which occurred in Degrassi Junior High , Degrassi High and School 's Out were written into the episode . Throughout those two series , Joey would frequently wear a fedora which became that character 's trademark prop . The fedora made a reappearance in this episode , and was worn by Manny , Spike , Snake , Caitlin and Lucy , but not Joey , and it appeared in every scene which featured a character from the old series . The accident in School 's Out when Wheels hit Lucy while drink @-@ driving was discussed twice , first at the bar when the characters were discussing their lives , and a second time when Wheels came to the reunion to apologize to Lucy . Finally , Joey and Caitlin made amends ; their relationship had ended when he cheated on her with Tessa in School 's Out . 
 Prior to the episode airing , a website was created with a " virtual school " in which fans could " enrol " in order to receive regular emails from their character " classmates " and discuss ongoing plots , in an effort to provide a complete viewing experience for the audience . As the broadcast date of the episode neared , more content was added to the website to make it appear as if it were a true school reunion website . The website was actually seen on screen when the characters Spike and Caitlin were reminiscing about their high school days . 
 " Mother and Child Reunion " aired on the terrestrial television network CTV on October 14 , 2001 and was advertised as a television special . In the United States it was broadcast on July 1 , 2002 on The N , a digital cable network , and served as the final episode of season one . In Australia , the episode aired on the terrestrial network ABC TV on August 1 , 2002 . The episode has been released on DVD as part of the complete first season DVD boxset , which was released in Canada on October 19 , 2004 , in the U.S. on September 28 , 2004 , and in Australia on September 8 , 2010 . The episode is also available at iTunes Stores to download and watch on home computers and certain iPod models , and at Zune Marketplace for the Xbox 360 and Zune media players . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Producers were able to bring back a number of actors from Degrassi High to guest star as their characters for the reunion storyline . Stefan Brogren , Pat Mastroianni , Stacie Mistysyn and Amanda Stepto agreed early on to return for the episode to play their characters Archie " Snake " Simpson , Joey Jeremiah , Caitlin Ryan and Christine " Spike " Nelson respectively , and appeared at the CTV press conference in June to publicize the new series . Brogren and Stepto signed contracts to appear in the entire season . Dan Woods also returned to play Dan <unk> , now principal of Degrassi Community School . By the time " Mother and Child Reunion " began to shoot , twelve more former Degrassi High cast members had agreed to appear : <unk> Jean Brown ( Trish Skye ) , Darrin Brown ( Dwayne Myers ) , Michael Carry ( Simon Dexter ) , Irene <unk> ( Alexa <unk> ) , <unk> <unk> ( Diana <unk> ) , Anais Granofsky ( Lucy Fernandez ) , Rebecca Haines ( Kathleen Mead ) , Sara Holmes ( Alison Hunter ) , Neil Hope ( Derek " Wheels " Wheeler ) , Kyra Levy ( Maya Goldberg ) , Cathy Keenan ( Liz O 'Rourke ) , and <unk> <unk> ( Yick Yu ) all reprised their roles . 
 For the new generation of students , the producers chose from six hundred auditionees , all of whom were children in an attempt to provide a group of characters that the target audience of teenagers could relate to , rather than actors in their twenties pretending to be teenagers , something other shows of the same period and target audience such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson 's Creek were doing . Miriam McDonald first auditioned in October 2000 to play Emma Nelson , Spike 's daughter , and was selected for the role after a callback and three screen tests . Ryan Cooley appeared as J.T. Yorke , Jake Goldsbie as Toby Isaacs , and Cassie Steele as Manny Santos . All signed their contracts just days before appearing at the CTV press conference . Christina Schmidt appeared briefly as Terri McGreggor , and Melissa McIntyre appeared in just one scene as Ashley Kerwin ; she had no lines to speak in this episode . Cassie Steele 's sister , Alex Steele , made her first appearance as Angela Jeremiah , Joey 's six @-@ year @-@ old daughter . She returned with Mastroianni to the series at the beginning of season two to take on more permanent roles . 
 Film director Kevin Smith , who had been a fan of Degrassi from the early 1990s when he worked at a convenience store in Leonardo , New Jersey , has paid homage to Degrassi by making reference to it in several of his films . For example , he named a Clerks character Caitlin Bree after Caitlin Ryan , his favorite Degrassi character , wrote Shannen Doherty 's character Rene wearing a Degrassi jacket throughout his Mallrats film , and had Jason Lee 's character in Chasing Amy specifically mention Degrassi Junior High as the television show he would rather be watching , instead of going out . At the press conference for the new series , Schuyler announced that Smith would appear in " Mother and Child Reunion " as Caitlin 's boyfriend , but due to scheduling conflicts he was unable to film the role and it was passed on to Don McKellar . Smith and his View <unk> sidekick Jason Mewes later guest starred in Degrassi : The Next Generation for three episodes of season four , two episodes of season five , and four episodes of season eight .

 " Mother and Child Reunion " received mixed reviews from the media . Stephanie McGrath of Canoe.ca 's <unk> acknowledged Miriam McDonald 's portrayal of Emma Nelson as " stellar acting abilities in a super creepy storyline ... high on tension , low on cheese [ and ] top @-@ notch " , and continued , " The young actors actually showed up their classic Degrassi counter @-@ parts in the pilot episode . Their acting was solid , believable and age @-@ appropriate , while some of the older crowd 's dialogue sounded a bit stilted and over @-@ rehearsed . Slightly wooden acting aside , it was still good to see Joey , Caitlin and the gang together again . Emma 's story @-@ line demonstrates that the creative forces behind The Next Generation haven 't lost touch with teens yet , showing that one instalment of Degrassi : The Next Generation is worth 20 episodes of Dawson 's Creek . " 
 Tony Atherton of the Ottawa Citizen had mixed feelings of the new incarnation , saying it " has a cleaner , more polished look , has lost its edge [ and offers ] nothing new to viewers familiar with the groundbreaking preceding series , nor to anyone else who has watched the deluge of teen dramas since " , adding that because there is " little ground left to break in teen drama there is a sense of déjà vu with regards to the plots and characters " . He did , however , praise the show for having " the same simple narrative told from a kid 's viewpoint , and the same regard for unvarnished reality [ as Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High ] . It is light years from far @-@ fetched high @-@ school melodramas like Boston Public and Dawson 's Creek ... is every bit as good as its beloved predecessor . In fact , in some respects it is even better " . 
 When the series began in the U.S. , The Seattle Times ' Melanie McFarland was unsure whether its success and popularity in Canada would continue across the border . " As popular as Degrassi was , it was still a mere cult hit in the United States ; the crowd that had access to it initially on PBS might not be able to tune into [ The N ] . Soft @-@ pedaling through the issues might work for today 's family of viewers , but what 's gentle enough for Mom and Dad 's peace of mind might not be enough to hook Junior or the original Degrassi 's older fans " . She was , however , " happy The N chose Degrassi students to navigate teen perils instead of digging up Screech and the gang characters from Saved by the Bell , a popular children 's sitcom from the early 1990s for another nauseating go @-@ round " . 
 " Mother and Child Reunion " was nominated for two Directors Guild of Canada Awards , winning in the " Outstanding Achievement in a Television Series – Children 's " category , and picked up two Gemini Award nominations in the categories for " Best Photography in a Dramatic Program or Series " and " Best Short Dramatic Program " .

 Whedonesque.com ( also referred to as Whedonesque and spelled in the site 's logo as <unk> ) is a collaborative weblog devoted to the works of Joss Whedon . At its inception in 2002 , Whedonesque covered Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel , but has since expanded to follow Whedon 's professional output , as well as the careers of cast and crew associated with Whedon projects . Since 2004 , the site has been recognized in other media outlets by awards and citations of Whedon 's writings originally posted to Whedonesque . 
 Beyond simply being an informational site , Whedonesque has been referenced in books and cited in academic papers . It is used by marketers to drum up interest in Buffy products and by comic book editors to gauge reader reactions . Whedon has occasionally posted his personal political views to the site , such as during the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike . This led some to mistakenly believe that Whedonesque is Whedon 's personal or official site and prompted some fans to take up the writers ' cause . 
 Posters to the site are usually referred to as " <unk> " . User registration is required to post , but is often closed .

 Whedonesque was started in mid @-@ 2002 by Caroline van Oosten de Boer , who remains the site owner as of February 2009 , and Milo Vermeulen . Whedonesque started with a set of rules designed to mandate linking to external sites , encourage civil conduct , discourage copyright violations , and minimize discussion of perpetually contentious issues . The first print media mention of Whedonesque was a one sentence blurb in USA Today a month after its launch . In 2003 , it was cited as one of two top Buffy Internet sites in an article commemorating the show 's end .

 The site 's popularity grew even further once Whedon himself started posting . Whedon first acknowledged reading Whedonesque in late 2004 , and the account ' joss ' was created for his use on August 15 , 2004 . Whedon 's first post directly to the site was on April 27 , 2005 , announcing preview screenings of Serenity . He later extended his involvement , using the site as a means of communication with fans on topics including his own fandom of Veronica Mars , the canonicity of Buffy Season 8 comic books , and status updates on his projects . Through the use of tagging , Whedonesque maintains a list of threads Whedon has started or in which he has posted . In 2006 , Angel : After the Fall comic book author Brian Lynch began posting to Whedonesque as well . 
 Late 2004 saw the first two recognitions of Whedonesque.com by major Internet media .

 In early 2007 , Whedon announced the end of his relationship with the Wonder Woman movie in a Whedonesque post , which was directly cited in traditional media , including Reuters , the Los Angeles Times , and industry press . That year Whedonesque was also cited in much more modest coverage of Whedon 's involvement with Runaways and The Office . In February 2008 , Whedonesque was cited as a source in a New York Times piece on Steven Brust 's Firefly novel , My Own Kind of Freedom . Later that year , Whedonesque was cited in mainstream media treatment of Dollhouse ( especially Whedon 's post explaining the new pilot ) and Dr. Horrible 's Sing @-@ Along Blog . The site was taken offline for a day by the attention prompted by the release of Dr. Horrible , resulting in the site 's movement from <unk> , where it had originated , to <unk> Unlike previous mainstream media mentions , Dollhouse and Dr. Horrible have garnered Whedonesque mainland European media attention .

 = Frank McGee ( ice hockey ) = 
 Francis Clarence McGee , ( November 4 , 1882 – September 16 , 1916 ) was an ice hockey player during the early days of hockey for the Ottawa Hockey Club , nicknamed the Silver Seven . Though blind in one eye , McGee was a legendary player of his era , and known as a prolific scorer . He once scored 14 goals in a Stanley Cup game and eight times scored five or more . Despite a brief senior career — only 45 games over four seasons — he led the Silver Seven in its reign as Stanley Cup champions during this time ( 1903 – 06 ) , playing both centre and rover . During World War I , he enlisted in the Canadian Army and died in battle in France . When the Hockey Hall of Fame was founded in 1945 , McGee was one of the original nine inductees . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Frank McGee came from a prominent Canadian family . His late uncle , Thomas D 'Arcy McGee , had been a Father of Confederation . His father , John Joseph McGee , was clerk of the Privy Council ( considered the top civil servant position ) . Frank was one of nine children born to John Joseph McGee and Elizabeth Crotty . Frank had five brothers and three sisters , Thomas D 'Arcy , Jim , John , Walter , Charles , Katharine , Mary and Lillian . His brother Jim was also a noted athlete in football and ice hockey before dying in a horse @-@ riding accident in May 1904 . Charles , like Frank , also died in World War I. 
 After his education in Ottawa , McGee worked for the Canadian government Department of Indian Affairs , but he had a passion for sports and played lacrosse and rugby and excelled at ice hockey . While playing half @-@ back for his rugby team , Ottawa City , he was a member of the team that won the Canadian championship in 1898 . He played for the Ottawa Hockey Club from 1902 until 1906 . 
 He enlisted in the military and fought in World War I for the 43rd Regiment ( Duke of Cornwall ’ s Own Rifles ) as a lieutenant in the 21st Infantry Battalion , starting in May 1915 . That December he suffered a knee injury , and was sent to England to recover . He was given the choice of a posting in Le Havre away from the action , but chose to return to his battalion at the front . He returned to the 21st Battalion in August 1916 for the Battle of the Somme and was killed in action on September 16 , 1916 near Courcelette , France . His body was never recovered . His brother Charles died in action in May 1915 . 
 It is not known how McGee was allowed into the army with sight in only one eye . In his certificate of examination , the medical officer wrote that McGee could " see the required distance with either eye . " According to McGee 's nephew , Frank Charles McGee , his uncle tricked the doctor . When he was asked to cover one eye and read the chart he covered his blind eye , and when required to cover the other eye he switched hands instead of eyes . His medical history only lists " good " for his vision . 
 = = Hockey career = = 
 On March 21 , 1900 , the young and promising McGee lost use of an eye during an amateur game for a local Canadian Pacific Railway team from a " lifted puck . " He retired from playing , becoming a referee . By 1903 , he missed playing the sport so much that he joined the Ottawas despite the risk of permanent blindness . McGee was the youngest member of the team and stood only five feet six inches tall in a brutal sport ; regardless , he excelled . 
 McGee was considered an outstanding playmaker and deadly scorer . He scored two goals in his first game with Ottawa . On a number of occasions , he scored several goals in a single game , the most famous being his 14 @-@ goal effort in a 23 @-@ 2 victory over the team from Dawson City , on January 16 , 1905 . Those 14 goals , which included eight consecutive goals scored in less than nine minutes , remain to this day the most goals scored by a single player in a Stanley Cup hockey game , and has not been surpassed in any professional match . It was the most lopsided playoff game in Stanley Cup history . He scored five or more goals in eight other senior matches ; his highest single @-@ game total in regular season play was eight on March 3 , 1906 against the Montreal Hockey Club . 
 His linemates included future Hall of Famers Alf Smith , Harry Westwick , Billy Gilmour and Tommy Smith . Frank Patrick , a contemporary of McGee 's and like him a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame , described McGee : " He was even better than they say he was . He had everything - speed , stickhandling , scoring ability and was a punishing checker . He was strongly built but beautifully proportioned and he had an almost animal rhythm . " 
 After Ottawa lost the Stanley Cup to the Montreal Wanderers in 1906 , McGee retired at just 23 years old . His retirement is attributed to his government position not allowing him to travel . He had briefly retired after his brother Jim 's death in 1904 . McGee retired after scoring 135 goals in only 45 games ( both league and challenge ) . Only Russell Bowie rivals his average of 3 goals per game . 
 McGee was one of the original players inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame at its founding in 1945 . Five years later , a poll of sports editors of Canadian newspapers selected the Silver Seven as the country ’ s outstanding team in the first half of the 20th century . In 1966 , he was inducted into the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame .

 Fuad Muhammad Syafruddin ( 18 February 1963 – 16 August 1996 ) , best known by his pen name Udin , was an Indonesian journalist who was murdered in 1996 . A reporter at the Yogyakarta , Java , daily newspaper Bernas , he published a series of articles on corruption in the Bantul Regency in the months before his death . On 13 August , he was attacked at his house by two unidentified assailants using a metal rod and taken to the hospital . He died three days later without regaining consciousness . 
 His murder became a national cause célèbre . Several independent inquiries concluded that local government officials had been involved . However , the Bantul police early on discounted a political motive . Instead , they arrested a local driver named Dwi Sumaji for the murder , alleging a motive of jealousy . Sumaji was later acquitted after the prosecution withdrew its case owing to a lack of evidence . The police in turn were successfully sued for their mishandling of the case and deliberate destruction of evidence . The murder has never been solved , and is expected to be <unk> after 2014 due to Indonesia 's 18 @-@ year statute of limitations on murder . 
 = = Life and journalism = = 
 Udin was born on 18 February 1963 , a date considered unlucky in the Javanese calendar as it fell on a <unk> Monday . His father was Wagiman <unk> , a mosque watchman , and his mother was <unk> ; Udin had five siblings . As a young man , Udin had wanted to join the Indonesian military , but was unable due to his family 's lack of political connections . Instead , he worked various manual labour jobs , including stonemason . 
 In the ten years prior to his death , Udin was a freelance reporter for Bernas , a daily newspaper of Yogyakarta , Java , owned by the Kompas Gramedia Group . He was known for writing about crime and local politics , and would also take pictures to illustrate his articles . Aside from his reporting , Udin and his wife Marsiyem owned a small store which developed pictures and sold stationary ; Marsiyem would usually manage the store . 
 In 1996 , Udin began a series of articles reporting on corruption in the regency of Bantul , a suburb of Yogyakarta , focusing particularly on the activities of Bantul 's regent Colonel Sri Roso Sudarmo . In one report , Udin stated that Sudarmo had paid a bribe of Rp . 1 billion ( US $ 111 @,@ 000 ) to President Suharto 's <unk> Foundation to secure his reappointment that year . Udin also reported that Sudarmo had demanded that village heads guarantee a " 200 per cent " victory for Golkar ( President Suharto 's party ) in the upcoming legislative elections . 
 Following the publication of these articles , Udin began to complain of what he considered a campaign of official harassment . Some district officials had reportedly spoken to him about his writings , and others had threatened him with a libel action . As a result of this perceived harassment , Udin had filed multiple complaints with the Legal Aid Institute ( Lembaga <unk> <unk> ) in Yogyakarta . Udin had also been offered bribes to cease his reporting and received threats of violence . When his wife asked him about the threats , he responded , " What I write is the facts . If I have to die , I will accept it . " The night of his murder , two men came to the Bernas office looking for him , but a secretary sent them away . 
 = = Murder = = 
 On 13 August 1996 at around 10 : 30 pm local time ( UTC + 7 ) , Udin received two visitors outside his home in Bantul , off Parangtritis Road . The visitors claimed to want to leave a motorcycle with him for safekeeping , and reportedly had come the day before as well . While his wife Marsiyem was preparing tea , the men attacked him with a metal rod , striking him in the head and stomach . The assailants then escaped on a motorcycle they had parked in front of his home . Marsiyem found Udin unconscious on the ground , bleeding from his ears . 
 With the help of six youths passing in a jeep and a neighbour , Marsiyem took Udin to a small hospital nearby . The hospital was not equipped to treat Udin 's wounds , so he was transferred to Bethesda Hospital , a Protestant institution in Yogyakarta . In a coma , he was diagnosed with a fractured skull ; a shard of bone had also punctured his skull . 
 Initially , coverage of the assault in Bernas was slow . The murder had occurred too late in the evening to be covered in the 14 August edition , and head editor <unk> – due to press censorship – was uncomfortable with covering a politically charged case . However , other staff members convinced him to give greater coverage , and the front page of the 15 August edition showed Udin covered in bandages and gave detailed information about the case . On 16 August , Udin died without having regained consciousness ; on the morning of his death , a breathing tube had been inserted . 
 After his death , Udin 's body was autopsied then brought to the Bernas office for a quick memorial service , in which the staff sang " <unk> Bunga " ( " Fallen Flowers " ) . The following day , Udin was buried in a small cemetery in <unk> , Bantul ; his burial attracted 2 @,@ 000 people . Udin was survived by his wife Marsiyem and two children , <unk> and Wikan . 
 = = Investigation and cause célèbre = = 
 Investigation into the assault began even before Udin 's death . The police began their investigation on 13 August , but were hampered as the crime scene had been contaminated during the commotion after the assault . Under the command of Sergeant Major Edy Wuryanto , the police began by collecting Udin 's notes and blood from his family ; the family had received several bags of blood from Bethesda and were planning to bury it with the body . 
 Meanwhile , five members of the Indonesian Journalists ' Association ( <unk> Wartawan Indonesia , or PWI ) formed a fact @-@ finding team on 14 August under the leadership of <unk> <unk> and <unk> Sutan . The team read the articles written by Udin in the previous six months , looking for any coverage which could have led to the attack ; they concluded that most of his articles could have been a trigger . The committee eventually focused on the bribery allegations against Sudarmo , as those were the only ones exclusively covered in Bernas , as well as a case of election rigging . Another team , from Bernas , known as the " White Kijang " team for the type of car they drove , investigated the case independently when the PWI team failed to share the information they had gathered . 
 Udin 's death swiftly became a national cause célèbre , with the circumstances of his death and the resulting investigation covered extensively in national media . Muslim prayer services held by Bernas seven days after Udin 's death attracted hundreds of mourners and saw several community leaders give speeches on politics and Udin 's death . Others , such as Goenawan Mohamad , wrote poems and flowery obituaries . 
 Though police ruled out Udin 's political reporting as a motive in the early stages of the investigation , many reports focused on the theory that his killing had been related to his reporting on Sudarmo . One journalist quoted the regent as having said shortly before the murder that he would like to teach Udin " a lesson " . The police focused instead on allegations of infidelity ; in late August the police stated that Udin had been murdered by a jealous husband as a result of an extramarital affair with a woman named Tri <unk> , a Citizens Band radio enthusiast who had once dated Udin 's younger brother . However , <unk> soon admitted to the press that she had been paid to fabricate this testimony by a nephew of Sri Roso . 
 Meanwhile , the PWI and Bernas teams concluded that Udin had been murdered by a government official intent on saving face . By late September , Bernas was under political pressure to cease coverage of the case . One of the PWI team members , <unk> , reported that his daughter had been nearly kidnapped and his home broken into . Several journalistic and human rights organisations stated their belief that the murder was likely connected with Udin 's reporting , including Amnesty International , which expressed its concern that allegations about the involvement of government officials had " not been properly investigated " . The Committee to Protect Journalists sent a letter to President Suharto that demanded a full investigation into Udin 's death , with the results made public . An independent report by the Indonesian Alliance of Independent Journalists praised the courage and neutrality of Udin 's reporting , stating , " he was not an NGO activist , nor was he involved in the student movement . He was just an ordinary journalist who did an average job for a regional newspaper . " However , the regent denied these reports and rumours ; in a press conference on 23 August 1996 , he said that he was " at the receiving end of over @-@ dramatization " . 
 = = Arrest of Dwi Sumaji = = 
 On 21 October , the police arrested Dwi Sumaji , an advertising company driver , for the murder ; they alleged that Sumaji had killed Udin for having an affair with his wife , <unk> . After Sumaji confessed to the crime , police announced that an iron bar and a T @-@ shirt , both stained with Udin 's blood , had been found in Sumaji 's home . Though Sumaji 's police @-@ appointed lawyer agreed that Sumaji had confessed to the crime , within a week Sumaji obtained independent counsel through whom he attempted to withdraw the confession . Marsiyem , who had seen her husband 's attackers , insisted that Sumaji was innocent . On 23 October , Bernas published a sketch of Udin 's attacker , drawn soon after the murder based on Marsiyem 's description , with a picture of Sumaji ; under Sumaji 's photograph , they wrote " <unk> " ( " rejected " ) , drawing attention to the dissimilarities between the two . 
 Sumaji withdrew his confession , then alleged that police had encouraged him to confess after plying him with alcohol and bribing him with money , a prostitute , and a better job if he confessed to the crime . <unk> , incredulous that her husband could be a murderer , wrote letters to several high @-@ ranking officials and bodies , including President Suharto . Only one , to the National Commission on Human Rights ( <unk> HAM ) , received a reply : on 28 October , the commission announced that it would investigate irregularities in Sumaji 's arrest and internment . Meanwhile , Sumaji 's counsel and the White Kijang team located several witnesses to corroborate Sumaji 's account , including the prostitute . 
 The police continued the investigation , under pressure to finish quickly . Two reconstructions of the murder were conducted , drawing hundreds of spectators . One was done with Sumaji playing the role of the murderer , without his lawyers ' knowledge ; when the counsel found out , they removed him from the reconstruction . Eventually , police agreed to a deal with the counsel , in which Sumaji 's pre @-@ trial release was guaranteed in exchange for a promise from his lawyers to not sue for wrongful arrest . Sumaji was released on 17 December , awaiting trial . In early 1997 , Sumaji 's case was refused by the prosecutor 's office several times due to weak evidence .

 On 7 November , Udin 's family announced their intention to sue the city for improper use of evidence . This announcement followed a report from police chief <unk> that Udin 's blood had been disposed of in the southern sea off Parangtritis Beach as an offering to Nyai Roro Kidul , the area 's deity , to ensure quick resolution of the investigation . Marsiyem 's lawyers from the Legal Aid Institute ( Lembaga <unk> <unk> ) filed a case in January 1997 against the police ( national , provincial , and local ) , and Edy Wuryanto . The lawsuit demanded Rp . 1 million ( US $ 36 @,@ 400 ) in damages . The police countered that the blood had been given voluntarily , and that Marsiyem hoped to exploit the situation . 
 The hearing began on 21 January 1997 , under the supervision of a three @-@ judge panel led by Mikaela Warsito . After both sides were unable to come to an amicable settlement , a several @-@ month @-@ long trial began , in which Udin 's family , Bernas reporters , and the police testified . On 7 April 1997 , Wuryanto was convicted of destroying evidence for taking the blood , which <unk> 's lawyers speculated was used to frame Sumaji . Only a small percentage of the damages were awarded , after the court ruled that testimony from Udin 's family – whom they saw as having a conflict of interest in the outcome of the case – was ineligible . 
 = = Trial of Sumaji = = 
 Shortly before Marsiyem 's case concluded , the members of the White Kijang team were assigned to other , distant cities . After a final , unsuccessful , plea by Sumaji 's council on 5 May 1997 to drop the case , the prosecutor 's office appointed <unk> Naim to lead the case against Sumaji . On 15 July , after the legislative elections , the office filed charges ; the trial began on 29 July , with two members of the three @-@ judge panel that served in the Marsiyem case . 
 After a failed attempt by the defence to question the court 's jurisdiction , several witnesses were questioned over a period of several weeks , including Udin 's neighbours and wife , as well as Sudarmo 's nephew . The hearings , which were held on Mondays and Thursdays , were filled with spectators . At the trial , the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible , but were told by the tribunal to focus on the case at hand . Further witnesses , including a key witness for the prosecution , came across as unconvincing ; they also changed their stories , reneging statements which they had made before the trial . Other witnesses for the prosecution , including several of Sumaji 's neighbours , testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because he was at home on the night of 13 August . Another said that the steel pipe said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin 's blood on it . 
 On 2 October 1997 , the prosecution began to call more witnesses . Although attendance did not abate , most observers were police officers or paid spectators . One witness , who claimed to have participated in a sting operation to arrest Sumaji , was arrested for perjury . An officer who investigated Sumaji reported that he had pursued the driver based on instinct , not evidence . Wuryanto , while presenting his account , was contemptuous towards the defence and ordered by the judge several times to answer truthfully . On 3 November , the prosecution withdrew its case . Under Indonesian law , the judges had the right to find the subject guilty despite the prosecution 's withdrawal ; after further consideration , on 27 November , the tribunal acquitted Sumaji . Following the acquittal , <unk> police refused to investigate Udin 's murder further ; several of Yogyakarta 's police chiefs stated that the department had fulfilled its duty by arresting a suspect and sending him to trial . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On 6 June , several weeks after President Suharto resigned , Sudarmo was ousted from his office after students conducted a sit @-@ in at the Bantul Assembly House . He was soon convicted of corruption for his payment to the <unk> Foundation , but the conviction was overturned by a higher court , after which Sudarmo retired . Wuryanto never served time for his disposal of Udin 's blood . 
 Sumaji 's defence initially prepared a legal case for wrongful imprisonment , but the driver chose not to pursue it . He was unable to work for three years due to the infamy he had acquired from the case , but by 2000 was driving a public bus near Mount Merapi . By 2000 , Marsiyem had married a neighbour , with whom she had a child . 
 The Alliance of Independent Journalists created the " Udin Award " in Udin 's honour , " given for exceptional contribution to press freedom " . In 2010 , the organisation also petitioned the National Police to take over the case , noting that under Indonesian law , the case could be declared " expired " in 2014 . 
 = Parsnip = 
 The parsnip ( Pastinaca sativa ) is a root vegetable closely related to the carrot and parsley . It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual . Its long , tuberous root has cream @-@ colored skin and flesh ; and left in the ground to mature , it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts . In its first growing season , the plant has a rosette of pinnate , mid @-@ green leaves . If unharvested , it produces its flowering stem , topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers , in its second growing season . By this time , the stem is woody and the tuber is inedible . The seeds are pale brown , flat , and winged . 
 The parsnip is native to Eurasia . It has been used as a vegetable since antiquity and was cultivated by the Romans , although some confusion exists in the literature of the time between parsnips and carrots . It was used as a sweetener before the arrival in Europe of cane sugar . It was introduced into the United States in the 19th century . 
 The parsnip is usually cooked , but can also be eaten raw . It is high in vitamins and minerals , especially potassium . It also contains antioxidants and both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber . It can be cultivated in deep , stone @-@ free soils . It is attacked by the carrot fly and other insect pests , viruses , and fungal diseases , of which canker is the most serious . Handling the stems and foliage can cause a skin rash if the skin is exposed to sunlight after handling . 
 = = Description = = 
 The parsnip is a biennial plant with a rosette of roughly hairy leaves that has a pungent odor when crushed . Parsnips are grown for their fleshy , edible , cream @-@ colored taproots . The roots are generally smooth , although lateral roots sometimes form . Most are cylindrical , but some cultivars have a more bulbous shape , which generally tends to be favored by food processors as it is more resistant to breakage . The plant 's apical meristem produces a rosette of pinnate leaves , each with several pairs of leaflets with toothed margins . The lower leaves have short stems , the upper ones are stemless , and the terminal leaves have three lobes . The leaves are <unk> or twice @-@ pinnate with broad , ovate , sometimes lobed leaflets with toothed margins ; they grow up to 40 cm ( 16 in ) long . The petioles are grooved and have sheathed bases . The floral stem develops in the second year and can grow to more than 150 cm ( 60 in ) tall . It is hairy , grooved , hollow ( except at the nodes ) , and sparsely branched . It has a few stalkless , single @-@ lobed leaves measuring 5 to 10 cm ( 2 to 4 in ) long that are arranged in opposite pairs . 
 The yellow flowers are in a loose , compound umbel measuring 10 to 20 cm ( 4 to 8 in ) in diameter . Six to 25 straight pedicels are present , each measuring 2 to 5 cm ( 1 to 2 in ) that support the <unk> ( secondary umbels ) . The umbels and <unk> usually have no upper or lower bracts . The flowers have tiny sepals or lack them entirely , and measure about 3 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 14 in ) . They consist of five yellow petals that are curled inward , five stamens , and one pistil . The fruits , or <unk> , are oval and flat , with narrow wings and short , spreading styles . They are colored straw to light brown , and measure 4 to 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 16 to 0 @.@ 31 in ) long . 
 Despite the slight morphological differences between the two , wild parsnip is the same taxon as the cultivated version , and the two readily cross @-@ pollinate . Parsnip has a chromosome number of 2n = 22 . 
 = = History = = 
 Like carrots , parsnips are native to Eurasia and have been eaten there since ancient times . <unk> and Hopf note that the archaeological evidence for the cultivation of the parsnip is " still rather limited " , and that Greek and Roman literary sources are a major source about its early use . They warn that " there are some difficulties in distinguishing between parsnip and carrot ( which , in Roman times , were white or purple ) in classical writings since both vegetables seem to have been sometimes called pastinaca , yet each vegetable appears to be well under cultivation in Roman times " . The parsnip was much esteemed , and the Emperor Tiberius accepted part of the tribute payable to Rome by Germany in the form of parsnips . In Europe , the vegetable was used as a source of sugar before cane and beet sugars were available . As <unk> <unk> , the " common " pastinaca figures in the long list of <unk> enjoyed by the Milanese given by <unk> da la Riva in his " Marvels of Milan " ( 1288 ) . 
 This plant was introduced to North America simultaneously by the French colonists in Canada and the British in the Thirteen Colonies for use as a root vegetable , but in the mid @-@ 19th century , it was replaced as the main source of starch by the potato and consequently was less widely cultivated . 
 In 1859 , a new cultivar called ' Student ' was developed by James Buckman at the Royal Agricultural College in England . He back @-@ crossed cultivated plants to wild stock , aiming to demonstrate how native plants could be improved by selective breeding . This experiment was so successful , ' Student ' became the major variety in cultivation in the late 19th century .
