 In 1935 , Dilling returned to her alma mater to accuse such people as university president Robert Maynard Hutchins , educational reformer John Dewey , activist Jane Addams and Republican Senator William Borah as communist sympathizers . Retail tycoon Charles R. <unk> asked for her help to obtain a public hearing after his niece complained that professors at the university were communists . They demanded the closure of the university . The Illinois legislature convened to discuss the matter , ultimately deciding that the claims were unfounded . Dilling delivered a frenetic half @-@ hour speech at the Assembly , with calls from the audience to " kill every communist " . She declared , " It is certain that the University of Chicago is diseased with Communism and that its contagion is a menace to the community and the Nation . " 
 Dilling 's next book , The Roosevelt Red Record and Its Background , published two weeks before the 1936 presidential election , was less successful . Like much of her later writing , it was largely a disjointed series of quotations . Roosevelt 's " Jew Deal " ( as many including Dilling were calling the New Deal ) was already a central theme of The Red Network , and it was already being debated elsewhere . Dilling later claimed that the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee was founded largely thanks to her two books . She wrote a pamphlet attacking Borah entitled Borah : " Borer from Within " the G.O.P. , fearing that if he won the presidential nomination voters would be forced to choose between two communists . She distributed 5 @,@ 000 copies at the Republican National Convention , and claimed credit for his defeat . 
 In 1938 , Dilling founded the Patriotic Research Bureau , a vast archive in Chicago with a staff of " Christian women and girls " from the Moody Bible Institute . She began regular publication of the Patriotic Research Bulletin , a newsletter outlining her political and personal views , which she mailed free of charge to her supporters . Editions were often 25 to 30 pages long , with a youthful photograph of the author on the cover conveying a personal touch . The masthead of early issues reads : " Patriotic Research Bureau . For the defense of Christianity and Americanism " 
 Dilling was paid $ 5000 in 1939 by industrialist Henry Ford to investigate communism at the University of Michigan . As well as funding the Nazi Party and distributing his anti @-@ semitic newspaper The Dearborn Independent during the 1920s , Ford was a financial supporter of dozens of anti @-@ semitic propagandists . Dilling discovered hundreds of books at the university library written by " radicals " . Her 96 @-@ page report stated that the university was " typical of those American colleges which have permitted Marxist @-@ bitten , professional theorists to inoculate wholesome American youths with their collectivist propaganda . " She reached a similar conclusion when the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce paid her to investigate UCLA , and when she investigated her children 's universities , Cornell and Northwestern . 
 In 1940 , hoping to influence the presidential election , Dilling published The Octopus , setting out her Jewish Communism theories . The book was published under the pseudonym " Rev. Frank Woodruff Johnson " . <unk> <unk> reported Dilling claiming that " The Jews can never prove that I 'm anti @-@ semitic , I 'm too clever for them . " Her husband feared that allegations of anti @-@ semitism would damage his law practice . She admitted that she was the author at her divorce trial in 1942 . She explained that it was written as a response to B 'nai B 'rith . She stated : " It airs their dirty lying attempts to shut every Christian mouth and prevent anyone from getting a fair trial in this country " ( for which she was cited for contempt ) . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Besides relying on a gendered appeal to patriotic duty , Dilling enjoyed portraying herself as a helpless victim confronted by diabolical evil . One telling example was when a federal subpoena in 1941 , issued by the Justice Department , ordered her to Washington DC to explain her alleged affiliations with Nazi sympathizers . She described her experiences at the " New Deal <unk> , " an unsubtle reference to Stalin 's secret police , in the format of a play , in which she acted the part of the victim interrogated by an agent of the New Deal . The dramatic scene overflowed with " sinister <unk> [ s ] , " " sarcastic questions " and " long harangue [ s ] . " The victim , " a bit weary with the endless hectoring , " answered unfair questions with righteous indignation . Throughout this little skit , Dilling downplayed her public role and denied the accusation that she was " an important woman " and that her " name carr [ ied ] weight . " A sincere act of humility this was not , but it did reveal Dilling 's inclination for martyrdom and self @-@ importance , as well as a talent for propaganda . 
 Dilling was a central figure in a mass movement of isolationist women 's groups , which opposed US involvement in World War II from a " <unk> " perspective . The membership of these groups in 1941 was between one and six million . According to historian Kari Frederickson : " They argued that war was the antithesis of <unk> motherhood , and that as women they had a particular stake in preventing American involvement in the European conflict . ... they intertwined their <unk> arguments with appeals that were right @-@ wing , anti @-@ Roosevelt , anti @-@ British , anti @-@ communist and anti @-@ Semitic . " 
 The movement was strongest in the Midwest , a conservative stronghold with a culture of anti @-@ semitism , which had long resented the political dominance of the East coast . Chicago was the base of far @-@ right activists Charles E. Coughlin , Gerald L. K. Smith and <unk> Clark Van Hyning , as well as the America First Committee , which had 850 @,@ 000 members by 1941 . Dilling spoke at America First meetings , and was involved in the founding of Van Hyning 's " We the Mothers <unk> for America " , a highly active group with 150 @,@ 000 members who were tasked with infiltrating other organizations . The Chicago Tribune , the newspaper with the highest circulation in the region , was strongly isolationist . It treated Dilling as a trusted expert on anti @-@ communism and continued to support her after she was charged with sedition . 
 In early 1941 , when the movement was at its height , Dilling spoke at rallies in Chicago and other cities in the Midwest , and recruited a group to coordinate her efforts to oppose Lend @-@ Lease , the " Mothers ' Crusade to Defeat H. R. 1776 " . Hundreds of these activists picketed the Capitol for two weeks in February 1941 . Dilling was arrested when she led a sit @-@ down strike with at least 25 other protesters in the corridor outside the office of 84 @-@ year @-@ old Senator Carter Glass . After a sensational trial lasting six days , she wept as she was found guilty of disorderly conduct and fined $ 25 . Glass called for the FBI to investigate the women 's groups , and stated in the New York Times on March 7 that the women had caused " a noisy disorder of which any self @-@ respecting fishwife would be ashamed . I likewise believe that it would be pertinent to inquire whether they are mothers . For the sake of the race , I devoutly hope not . " Isolationist leader Cathrine Curtis believed that the image of the Mothers ' movement had been wrecked , and privately criticised Dilling 's " hoodlum " tactics as " communistic " and " un @-@ womanly " . 
 Many of the women 's groups continued to oppose the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor , unlike their allies , the America First Committee . Dilling campaigned for Thomas E. Dewey in the 1944 presidential election , although she accused him of " fawning at the feet of international Jewry " . Her political activity decreased as a result of her highly publicized divorce trial , beginning in February 1942 , during which dozens of fist fights broke out , involving both men and women , and Dilling received three citations for contempt . The judge , Rudolph <unk> , said that he feared he would suffer " a nervous breakdown " during the four @-@ month trial . 
 A grand jury , convened in 1941 to investigate fascist propaganda , called several women 's leaders to testify , including Dilling , Curtis and Van Hyning . Roosevelt prevailed upon Attorney General Francis Biddle to launch a prosecution , and on July 21 , 1942 , Dilling and 27 other anti @-@ war activists were indicted on two counts of conspiracy to cause insubordination of the military in peacetime and wartime . The case was the main part of a government campaign against domestic subversion , which historian Leo P. <unk> labelled " The Brown Scare " . The charges and list of defendants were extended in January 1943 . The charges were again extended in January 1944 . The judge , Edward C. Eicher , suffered a fatal heart attack on November 29 , 1944 . A mistrial was declared . The charges were dismissed on November 22 , 1946 , after the government had failed to present any compelling new evidence of a German conspiracy . Biddle later called the proceedings " a dreary farce " . Dilling continued to publish the Patriotic Research Bulletin , and in 1954 , she published The Plot Against Christianity . The book " reveals the satanic hatred of Christ and Christians responsible for their mass murder , torture and slave labour in all Iron Curtain countries – all of which are ruled by <unk> " . It was retitled after her death to The Jewish Religion : Its Influence Today . 
 The UN Charter and treaties are constructed to make way for the " man of sin , " the Anti @-@ Christ who will hold supreme power over life or death as he briefly heads this last Red satanic world empire .

 = French battleship Bretagne = 
 Bretagne was a battleship of the French Navy built in the 1910s , and the lead ship of her class ; she had two sister ships , Provence and Lorraine . The ship was laid down in July 1912 at the Arsenal de Brest , launched in April 1913 , and commissioned into the fleet in February 1916 , after the outbreak of World War I. She was named in honour of the French region of Brittany , and was armed with a main battery of ten 340 mm ( 13 in ) guns . 
 Bretagne spent the bulk of her career in the French Mediterranean Squadron . During World War I , she was stationed at Corfu to prevent the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet from leaving the Adriatic Sea , but she saw no action . She remained in service during the 1920s and 1930s , while her sisters were placed in reserve . She participated in non @-@ intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War . Bretagne escorted convoys after the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , and was stationed in Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir when France surrendered on 22 June 1940 . Fearful that the Germans would seize the French Navy , the British Royal Navy attacked the ships at Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir ; in the attack Bretagne was hit badly and exploded , killing the majority of her crew . The wreck was eventually raised in 1952 and broken up for scrap . 
 = = Design = = 
 Bretagne was 166 meters ( 544 ft 7 in ) long overall and had a beam of 26 @.@ 9 m ( 88 ft 3 in ) and a full @-@ load draft of 9 @.@ 8 m ( 32 ft 2 in ) . She displaced around 25 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 25 @,@ 000 long tons ; 28 @,@ 000 short tons ) at full load and had a crew of between 1124 and 1133 officers and enlisted men . She was powered by four Parsons steam turbines with twenty @-@ four Niclausse boilers . They were rated at 29 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 22 @,@ 000 kW ) and provided a top speed of 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . Coal storage amounted to 2 @,@ 680 t ( 2 @,@ 640 long tons ; 2 @,@ 950 short tons ) . 
 Bretagne 's main battery consisted of ten 340mm / 45 Modèle 1912 guns mounted in five twin gun turrets , numbered from front to rear . They were placed all on the centerline ; two were in a superfiring pair forward , one amidships , and the last two in a superfiring arrangement aft . The secondary battery consisted of twenty @-@ two Canon de 138 mm Modèle 1910 guns in casemates along the length of the hull . She also carried seven 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns , two on the conning tower and one on the roof of each turret . The ship was also armed with four submerged 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . The ship 's main belt was 270 mm ( 10 @.@ 6 in ) thick and the main battery was protected by up to 300 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) of armor . The conning tower had 314 mm ( 12 @.@ 4 in ) thick sides .

 Bretagne was laid down at the Arsenal de Brest on 1 July 1912 , launched on 21 April 1913 , and completed in September 1915 . She was commissioned into the French Navy on 10 February 1916 . After entering service in 1916 , Bretagne and her sisters were assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron , their unit for the remainder of the war , Bretagne becoming flagship of the squadron . They spent the majority of their time at Corfu to prevent the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic . The fleet 's presence was also intended to intimidate Greece , which had become increasingly hostile to the Triple Entente . Later in the war , men were drawn from their crews for anti @-@ submarine warfare vessels . As the Austro @-@ Hungarians largely remained in port for the duration of the war , Bretagne saw no action during the conflict . Indeed , she did not leave port at all for the entirety of 1917 , due to a severe shortage of coal at Corfu . Around July 1918 , the ship 's foremast was replaced by a tripod foremast that mounted an experimental fire @-@ control director and her mainmast was shortened to allow the ship to fly a captive kite balloon . Bretagne returned to Toulon in November 1918 . 
 The ship received a lengthy refit at Toulon from 12 June 1919 to 18 October 1920 . This included modifications to her gun turrets that increased the elevation of the 340 @-@ millimeter ( 13 in ) from 12 ° to 18 ° and thus their maximum range to 21 @,@ 000 meters ( 23 @,@ 000 yd ) . The four forward 138 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 4 in ) guns were removed . Both 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns and two 47 @-@ millimeter guns were replaced by four 75 mm AA guns mounted on the forward superstructure . A Vickers fire @-@ control director replaced the experimental model and it was equipped with a 3 @.@ 66 @-@ meter ( 12 ft 0 in ) rangefinder . Two additional 2 @-@ meter ( 6 ft 7 in ) rangefinders were installed , one on each side of the superstructure , to control the 138 mm guns . Bretagne became flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet in mid @-@ June 1921 and the ship accompanied Provence to Le Havre for a naval review , and were back in Toulon in September . In 1922 , Provence and Lorraine were placed in reserve , leaving Bretagne the only member of her class in service . She spent the 1920s conducting periodic fleet maneuvers and cruises around the Mediterranean and to French colonial possessions in West Africa . Provence became the fleet flagship in September 1923 . 
 Bretagne received a major refit at Toulon from 1 May 1924 to 29 September 1925 , during which the elevation of her main armament was increased to 23 ° , giving her a maximum range of 23 @,@ 700 meters ( 25 @,@ 900 yd ) , the forward hull armor was removed to make her less bow heavy , one group of boilers was converted to oil @-@ firing and two 1 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 4 ft 11 in ) high @-@ angle rangefinders were added for the AA guns . The ship resumed her position as flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet in October after her refit was completed , but Provence assumed that role in October 1927 when Bretagne began another refit to repair her boilers . The navy took the opportunity to upgrade her fire @-@ control systems ; replacing her Vickers system with a French Chamond @-@ Granat model , adding a 4 @.@ 57 @-@ meter ( 15 ft 0 in ) rangefinder at the top of the foremast and another on the conning tower . 
 Bretagne was modernized in 1931 – 32 ; her torpedo tubes and four more 138 mm guns were removed while four more 75 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns were added . In 1934 , Bretagne and Provence were assigned to the 2nd Squadron in the Atlantic . There , they joined fleet exercises off the Azores , Madeira , and Morocco . The two ships took part in a cruise to Africa in 1936 . In August , they were involved in non @-@ intervention patrols after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War ; these patrols lasted until April 1937 . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , Bretagne was based in Toulon . At the time , Italy remained neutral , so there was no immediate threat for the Mediterranean Fleet . In December , Bretagne covered convoy traffic in the Atlantic . On 4 December , she and Provence , along with the cruisers Colbert , Dupleix , and Primauguet and several destroyers and submarines operated out of Dakar . Around the middle of the month , the task force began to return to the Mediterranean . After returning to Toulon , Bretagne underwent an extensive overhaul , which lasted until 3 March 1940 . On 11 March , she left France carrying 1 @,@ 820 boxes of gold bars from the French treasury along with the cruiser <unk> , which carried another 1 @,@ 179 boxes . They arrived in Halifax on 10 April . On the return voyage , they escorted two American merchant ships carrying 82 aircraft bought by France and arrived at Toulon on 10 April . On 27 April , Bretagne and her two sisters were transferred to Alexandria . Bretagne and Provence returned to Mers El Kébir on 18 May .

 Following the French surrender on 22 June , the French fleet was to be disarmed under German and Italian supervision , under the terms of the Armistice . The British high command , however , was concerned that the French ships would be seized by the Axis powers and placed in service . The Axis navies would then outnumber the British Royal Navy . Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice Admiral James Somerville , the commander of Force H , to neutralize the French fleet at Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir . He was instructed to order the French vessels to join the British with the Free French , surrender for internment , to scuttle themselves , or be sunk . On 3 July , Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum ; the French rejected it , and so the British ships opened fire . 
 Bretagne was hit by four 15 @-@ inch ( 380 mm ) projectiles from HMS Hood , HMS Resolution , and HMS Valiant ( no ship is especially credited for ) . The two first shells <unk> simultaneously at the third British salvo . The first one hit the ship below the waterline under the turret IV , igniting some 340mm shells and triggering a massive explosion . The deflagration blew up bulkheads and <unk> doors , and set all the stern ablaze , killing about 350 sailors . In the meantime , the massive hole on the starboard side of the ship allowed a massive amount of water ( estimated at a rate of 300 tons per minute ) to pour in . This flooding prevented the complete destruction of the ship : it limited the fire around the aft 340mm magazines , which were now opened to the air . 
 The second shell struck above the waterline , in the aft engine room , killing all the sailors inside and damaged the internal communication system of the ship . 
 Seven minutes later , two other high @-@ caliber shells struck the Bretagne at the same time . The first one detonated at the base of the tripod mast , igniting some ready @-@ to @-@ use anti @-@ aircraft projectiles which were stored in lockers next to the anti @-@ aircraft mounts . The second one went through the central <unk> casemate , exploding deep inside the ship . A huge fire started , with leaking oil burning next to the ship . In about thirty seconds , the ship rolled over while a massive explosion occurred . 
 The sinking caused the loss of 977 of her crew , the vast majority of the 1 @,@ 147 French naval personnel killed in the attack . Some initial salvaging work was done in the aftermath of the attack , but the Allied invasion of North Africa in November 1942 interrupted the work . Because she was an impediment to the work of extension of the military harbor ( which was now a full military complex with anti @-@ atomic bunkers ) ; Bretagne ultimately was salvaged from 1952 to 1954 . The hull was cut in to big parts , which were raised and scrapped ashore . 
 = Colorado @-@ class battleship = 
 The Colorado @-@ class battleships were a group of four battleships built by the United States Navy after World War I. However , only three of the ships were completed : Colorado , Maryland , and West Virginia . The fourth , Washington , was over 75 % completed when she was canceled under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922 . As such , the Colorado @-@ class ships were the last and most powerful battleships built by the US Navy until the North Carolina class entered service on the eve of World War II . 
 The Colorados were the final group of Standard @-@ type battleships , designed to have similar speed and handling to simplify maneuvers with the line of battle . ( The South Dakota class which was to follow would in several ways have been a departure from this practice . ) Apart from an upgrade in striking power to eight 16 @-@ inch guns , the ships were essentially repeats of the earlier Tennessee class . The Colorados were also the last American capital ships built with four turrets and twin @-@ mounted guns . The change to larger guns was prompted by the Japanese Nagato @-@ class battleships , which also mounted eight 16 @-@ inch guns . 
 All three ships had extensive careers during World War II . Maryland and West Virginia were both present during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 . Maryland escaped relatively unscathed ; West Virginia was sunk in the shallow waters of the harbor but subsequently raised and repaired . All three ships served as artillery support ships during amphibious operations . Maryland and West Virginia were present at the last surface action between battleships , the Battle of Surigao Strait during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944 . The three ships , put into the reserve fleet after the end of the war , were scrapped by the late 1950s . 
 = = Design = = 
 The construction of battleships armed with 16 @-@ inch guns was envisioned by the United States Navy General Board and Bureau of Construction and Repair ( C & R ) as early as 1913 , as the upgrade in gun caliber promised twice the kinetic energy of the 12 @-@ inch gun then in service and half again as much as the 14 @-@ inch gun then being introduced . This weapon dominated the design of battleships between 1913 and 1916 , just as the 14 @-@ inch gun had dictated designs from 1908 to 1910 . However , while the General Board approved the 16 @-@ inch gun as early as 1911 , the secretary of the navy felt that a move to a new gun caliber might make capital ships still on the drawing board obsolete . For this reason , he restricted the Bureau of Ordnance to proceed no further than blueprints for the new gun as a hedge against foreign developments . He finally approved construction of this gun in October 1912 and the weapon was test fired successfully in August 1914 . This success , along with the unofficial news in several naval publications of 15- and 16 @-@ inch weapons being adopted by Britain , Italy , Germany and Japan , the Board considered abandoning construction of the Pennsylvania class in favor of an up @-@ gunned design . Such a move meant an increase of 8 @,@ 000 tons per ship , twice as much as the jump from the Nevadas to the Pennsylvanias . Debate continued for the next three years . Each year , President Woodrow Wilson 's secretary of the navy , Josephus Daniels , balked at the potential increase in cost and ordered instead that the design features of Standard Class be upheld . Daniels finally compromised with the 1917 design battleships by allowing their armament to be upgraded . This , however , was to be the only substantial change to be allowed . 
 The design of the Colorado class , therefore , was taken from the preceding Tennessee class ; other than the notable improvement of eight 16 in ( 410 mm ) / 45 caliber in four dual turrets taking the place of the Tennessee @-@ class 's twelve 14 in ( 360 mm ) / 50 caliber guns in four triple gun turrets , there was not a major difference between the two designs . Likewise , the Tennessees were the results of modifications to the New Mexico class , which had been the most modern US capital ships to see service in World War I and had attracted the attention of British constructors both serving with and outside C & R. This similarity would carry over into the Lexington and South Dakota classes as the United States Navy increasingly standardized its capital ship designs . This was partly the result of wartime experience , when over 250 destroyers and more than 450 submarine chasers had to be built quickly for service in the North Atlantic . The U.S. Navy had done this by a process almost akin to the assembly line , sticking to one basic design per class with a maximum amount of standardization and rationalization . Since the Naval Act of 1916 meant the imminent construction of 16 battleships and six battlecruisers , it was necessary to streamline production to save time and labor . 
 Nevertheless , while US battleships were standardized as much as possible , design improvements were incorporated whenever possible . Most of the changes in the Tennessees were incorporated prior to any of their keels being laid . However , plans for the underwater protection — the ships ' main defense against torpedoes and shells that fell short of the ship but traveled through the water to hit underneath the waterline — could not be worked out in time . The problem was that tests in caissons — experiments that would eventually prove that a series of compartments divided between being filled with liquid and being left empty would be a very effective defense against torpedoes — were not yet complete . In order to commence construction of the ships as soon as possible , bids sent out to shipbuilding corporations noted that if they were selected to build the ships , an alteration to the design of the ships three months after their keels were laid must be allowed . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The Colorados were extremely similar overall to the Tennessees , with a 624 @-@ foot ( 190 m ) overall length and a beam at the waterline of 97 feet ( 30 m ) . They displaced 32 @,@ 600 long tons ( 33 @,@ 100 t ) at normal load and 33 @,@ 590 long tons ( 34 @,@ 130 t ) at deep load and had a draft of 30 @.@ 5 feet ( 9 @.@ 3 m ) . Like the Tennessees , they were designed with a clipper bow to make the ships dryer in rough weather . One improvement over previous classes was the location of the secondary battery in the superstructure rather than the upper hull , where it had proved to be excessively wet . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Turbo @-@ electric transmission , which had been used in the prior class , was retained here . Advantages included the ability for the turbines to run at optimum speed without regard to propeller speed , which led to greater fuel economy and range , and an easier sub @-@ division of machinery , which increased the ships ' ability to withstand torpedo hits . Each of the four propeller shafts was powered by a 5 @,@ 424 kilowatt electric motor , fed by two two @-@ phase turbo generators ( General Electric for Maryland , Westinghouse for Colorado and West Virginia ) rated at 5 @,@ 000 volts ) . Eight oil @-@ fired Babcock & Wilcox water @-@ tube boilers , each in its individual compartment , provided steam for the generators . Altogether , the ships ' power plant was rated at 28 @,@ 900 electrical horsepower ( <unk> ) to provide a flank speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . With a maximum bunker capacity of <unk> tons , the Colorados ' range without refueling at sea was 10 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 19 @,@ 000 km ; 12 @,@ 000 mi ) .

 The Colorado class was armed with eight 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) / 45 caliber Mark 1 guns , which fired a 2 @,@ 100 @-@ pound ( 950 kg ) armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 600 feet per second ( 790 m / s ) and a rate of about 1 @.@ 5 rounds per minute to a range of 34 @,@ 300 yards ( 31 @,@ 400 m ) at a maximum turret elevation of 30 degrees . Development of this weapon had begun in August 1913 , using a bored @-@ out and relined 13 @-@ inch ( 330 mm ) Mark 2 gun , with the promise of twice the muzzle energy of the 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) / 50 caliber Mark 7 guns and 50 percent more than the 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) / 45 caliber weapon used on the Nevada @-@ class battleships . After an initial proof firing in July 1914 and minor changes , the 16 @-@ inch Mark 1 was re @-@ proved in May 1916 and production approved in January 1917 . When the Colorados were modernized in the 1930s , these guns were rebuilt per standard navy practice and redesignated 16 @-@ inch / 45 ( 40 @.@ 6 cm ) Mark 5 and Mark 8 . 
 = = = = Secondary guns = = = = 
 Fourteen 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 51 caliber Mark 15 guns were installed to defend against enemy destroyers . This was reduced to 12 in 1922 . The Mark 15 fired a 50 @-@ pound ( 23 kg ) shell at a velocity of 3 @,@ 150 feet per second ( 960 m / s ) to a maximum range of 14 @,@ 400 yards ( 13 @,@ 200 m ) at 45 degrees at a rate of seven rounds per minute and was extremely accurate , with a danger space longer than the range to the target for distances less than 3 @,@ 000 yards ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) . As in the New Mexico and Tennessee classes , these were mounted in unarmored casemates on the main deck , one deck higher than in previous classes , to allow them to be manned in heavy weather if necessary . 
 In 1942 , the Mark 15 guns were replaced on West Virginia with sixteen 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 38 caliber Mark 12 dual @-@ purpose guns in twin turrets . On Maryland and Colorado ten Mark 15s were retained and augmented with eight 5 in / 38 cal Mark 12s in single mountings with protective shields ; the twin turrets planned and later installed were at that time in short supply . The Mark 12 fired a 55 @.@ 18 @-@ pound ( 25 @.@ 03 kg ) shell to a maximum range of 17 @,@ 392 yards ( 15 @,@ 903 m ) and a maximum elevation of 37 @,@ 200 feet ( 11 @,@ 300 m ) at an elevation of 45 degrees . They had a high rate of fire due to their being hand @-@ loaded but power @-@ rammed and their capability for easy loading at any angle of elevation . The introduction of proximity @-@ fused anti @-@ aircraft shells in 1943 made the 5 in / 38 even more potent in this capacity .

 Four 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) / 23 caliber guns were mounted initially for anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defense . This was increased to eight guns in 1922 . These guns fired a 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 650 feet per second ( 500 m / s ) to a maximum range of 8 @,@ 800 yards ( 8 @,@ 000 m ) and ceiling of 18 @,@ 000 feet ( 5 @,@ 500 m ) at an elevation of 45 @.@ 3 degrees and a rate of between eight and nine rounds per minute . These weapons were replaced in 1928 @-@ 9 with the same number of 5 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) / 25 caliber guns , the first Navy gun designed specifically for AA use . They fired a 54 @-@ pound ( 24 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 155 feet per second ( 657 m / s ) at a rate of between 15 and 20 rounds per minute to a maximum range of 14 @,@ 500 yards ( 13 @,@ 300 m ) at an elevation of 45 degrees and a ceiling of 27 @,@ 400 feet ( 8 @,@ 400 m ) at a maximum elevation of 85 degrees . These guns were supplemented with eleven 28 mm machine guns in 1937 @-@ 8 . 
 In 1942 , the air defense system on these ships was overhauled completely . In addition to her 5 in / 38s , they carried sixteen Bofors 40 mm guns in quad mounts and up to thirty @-@ two Oerlikon 20 mm cannons in single mounts . The quad 40 mm Bofors fired a 1 @.@ 985 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 900 kg ) at a rate of 120 rounds per minute per barrel nominal , 140 to 160 rounds per minute when horizontal ( gravity assist ) , to a maximum range of 11 @,@ 133 yards ( 10 @,@ 180 m ) at 45 degrees and a ceiling of 22 @,@ 299 feet ( 6 @,@ 797 m ) . The 20 mm Oerlikons fired a 0 @.@ 271 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 123 kg ) shell at an average muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 725 feet per second ( 831 m / s ) and a practical rate of between 250 and 320 rounds per minute to a maximum range of 4 @,@ 800 yards ( 4 @,@ 400 m ) at 45 degrees and a ceiling of 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) . 
 A second overhaul of AA defense was made between 1944 and 1945 , as the Navy had found 20 mm shells too light to stop Japanese kamikaze planes ; this plus the higher approach speeds of these planes made these manually controlled guns obsolete . In their place , more quad 40 mm Bofors mounts were fitted . Maryland eventually carried forty quad 40 mm and eighteen 20 mm guns . Colorado 's quad 40s were increased to forty but she kept all her 20 mm guns . West Virginia carried forty quad 40 mm and fifty 20 mm. guns . 
 = = = Armor and underwater protection = = = 
 The " all or nothing " armor scheme introduced in the Nevada @-@ class battleships was continued here , as throughout the Standard @-@ type warships , with armor suite virtually identical to the preceding Tennessee class . The exception was an increase in belt armor near vital machinery to 16 inches ( 410 mm ) to correspond with the increased main gun caliber . Otherwise , the minimum thickness along the belt remained 14 inches ( 360 mm ) . Upper deck armor was 3 @.@ 6 inches ( 91 mm ) initially and was later increased to 4 @.@ 1 inches ( 100 mm ) . Lower deck armor ranged between 2 @.@ 25 and 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 57 and 38 mm ) and was also presumably strengthened during conversion . 
 As with the Tennessees , the Colorados were modernized in the 1930s to improve their staying power . A new underwater protection scheme featured five compartments separated by armored <unk> inches ( 19 mm ) thick on either side of the ship : an outer empty one , three filled , and an empty inner one . In addition , the eight boilers were moved from their location in previous designs and placed in separate spaces to port and starboard of the <unk> power plant . This arrangement formed another line of defense , which would allow the ship to sail if one or even an entire side of boilers was incapacitated . A consequence was the chief aesthetic change between the New Mexicos and Tennessees : the single large funnel of the former was replaced by two smaller funnels in the latter . 
 Other improvements imported from the Tennessee class included an attempt to move the forward torpedo room away from the 16 @-@ inch gun magazines , as the room was viewed as vulnerable . Also , the design called for the use of external , rather than internal , belt armor so that a " break in the continuity of the side structure " would not exist , which would minimize drag in the water and any corresponding waste of power . 
 = = Class history = = 
 With fiscal year 1917 appropriations , bids on the four Colorados were opened on 18 October 1916 ; though Maryland 's keel was laid on 24 April 1917 , the other three battleships were not until 1919 – 1920 . With the cancellation of the first South Dakota class , the Colorados were the last U.S. battleships to enter service for nearly two decades . They were also the final U.S. battleships to use twin gun turrets — the North Carolinas and second South Dakota classes had nine 16 @-@ inch / 45 caliber guns and the Iowas used nine 16 in / 50 caliber in three triple turrets . 
 = = = Inter @-@ war modernization = = = 
 Plans for modernization of the Tennessee and Colorado classes were made in October 1931 , in part to take advantage of loopholes in the Washington Naval Treaty . While reconstruction under this treaty was allowed only to increase protection from air and underwater attack , it could include improvements in fire control and increased elevation for main armament as these items were not listed in the treaty . Also , any changes made inside the hull could be justified as meant to increase protection , even if the outcome meant increased speed or longer operational range , since the term " blister " had been specified to limit changes only outside the hull , such as main armor belt thickness and main gun caliber . Modifications to the secondary battery were also outside the purview of the Washington Treaty . 
 Included in initial plans was some protection against chemical shells which contained poisonous gas , although the General Board stated in the late 1920s that <unk> a battleship hit with these shells would not be possible — the ship would have to be scuttled . Also , the deck armor was to be bolstered with 80 lb ( 36 kg ) <unk> treatment steel ( STS ) — which would add 1 @,@ 319 long tons ( 1 @,@ 340 t ; 1 @,@ 477 short tons ) to the displacement of the ships — the armor on the tops of the main turrets was to be made thicker , fire controls were to be improved with the latest technology , and new shells for the main guns were to be designed . Two , later four , 1 @.@ 1 " / 75 caliber machine cannons were to be added , and all of the machinery in place would be removed in favor of newer equipment so that the ships would not lose any speed with the great increase in weight . Blisters were also to be installed to improve buoyancy but not to increase the ships ' beams any greater than 106 feet ( 32 m ) so they could still use the Panama Canal when transferring from the Atlantic to the Pacific and vice verse . These improvements were estimated to cost about $ 15 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 per ship ( $ 71 @,@ 723 @,@ 000 total ) . However , with the country in the throes of the Great Depression , not much money was available for the Navy . Savings of $ 26 @,@ 625 @,@ 000 could be realized by reconditioning the propulsion machinery rather than replacing it , which would lower the ships ' speed . Adding protection against chemical shells could be dropped , along with development of the new shells . Nevertheless , the cost @-@ saving elements of the later proposal were later dropped . The Navy asked the Secretary of the Navy to request money in the fiscal year 1933 to modernize the two classes from Congress , but the depression worsened . Although proposals for modifications were still made , plans were put on hold and never carried out . 
 In the beginning of 1934 , the Bureau of Construction and Repair proposed that the " Big Five " — the two Tennessees and three Colorados — be fitted with anti @-@ torpedo bulges so that the ships could benefit from increased buoyancy ; because of , among other factors , the normal procedure of leaving port with the maximum amount of fuel possible on board , the five ships were quite overweight and rode low in the water . For example , in June 1935 , Tennessee had a normal operating displacement of 38 @,@ 200 long tons ( 38 @,@ 800 t ; 42 @,@ 800 short tons ) — more than 2 @,@ 000 long tons ( 2 @,@ 000 t ; 2 @,@ 200 short tons ) above the maximum emergency load her original design called for . This made her draft higher — meaning that the ship 's waterline was down 5 ft 4 in ( 1 @,@ 630 mm ) . Construction and Repair called for a bulge on the Colorados that would displace about 2 @,@ 000 long tons ( 2 @,@ 000 t ; 2 @,@ 200 short tons ) and raise the ships ' draft by 20 in ( 510 mm ) . Installing these would be a year 's worth of work , with each ship spending six months of that in a dry dock — the first month docked so that the hull shape could be determined , the next six sailing while the bulge was built , and the last five back in the dock so it could be added to the ship . 
 Three years later ( 1937 ) , the various Navy bureaus held a joint meeting to discuss a possible partial modernization of the Tennessee 's and Colorado 's . They were much different than the changes proposed in 1933 ; there were no provisions for extra deck armor , but many additions and replacements . To gain space for newer fire control systems , the ships were to be reboilered . The main and secondary battery fire controls were to be replaced , including new rangefinders and plotting room instruments for the main , while new Mark 33 anti @-@ aircraft fire control directors were planned . The mainmast and M2 Browning machine guns would be removed , and studies of the feasibility of a torpedo bulge , the addition of which Construction and Repair believed to be paramount , which would increase the beam to 108 ft ( 33 m ) and displacement to 39 @,@ 600 long tons ( 40 @,@ 200 t ; 44 @,@ 400 short tons ) . Varying plans for these were complete by October 1938 . None was a full reconstruction ; costs ranged from $ 8 @,@ 094 @,@ 000 to $ 38 @,@ 369 @,@ 000 per ship . However , as the money for the improvements would lessen the amount available for new battleship construction , and these would be better than even reconstructed old battleship , the Secretary of the Navy rejected these plans in November . Congress did appropriate $ 6 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 in 1939 for some of these improvements , including the bulges . 
 = = = World War II changes = = = 
 With the beginning of World War II in Europe , the Navy began to apply lessons learned by the British to U.S. ships . The King Board of 1940 – 1941 proposed sweeping changes to the secondary armament of the battleships to increase their defense against air attacks . These included the removal of all 5 in ( 130 mm ) / 25 caliber guns and 5 in / 51 in favor of the dual @-@ purpose 5 in / 38 , the addition of six quadruple 1 @.@ 1 in ( 28 mm ) machine cannons , and the cutting away of superstructure to clear arcs of fire for the new anti @-@ aircraft weapons . An ultimate secondary battery of sixteen 5 in / 38 in dual mounts , sixteen Bofors 40 mm in quadruple mounts and eight single Oerlikon 20 mm was called for by the board in 1941 , although they were not certain the ships could handle the added weight and it would take a large amount of time in dry dock for these modifications to take place . With these concerns , an interim measure of four 1 @.@ 1 in guns was proposed by the board ; however , the gun was not being produced in any great number very quickly , so a second interim solution was implemented . 3 in ( 76 mm ) / 50 caliber guns were added to all of the U.S. ' battleships except for Arizona and Nevada by June 1941 ; these were replaced on the three battleships in the Atlantic by the 1 @.@ 1 in by November — they received them first because they were closer to a war zone . 
 As these modifications were carried out upon the various battleships , much additional weight was added onto the already overweight ships , forcing torpedo bulges to be added so that a decent freeboard could be maintained . These would cost $ 750 @,@ 000 and around three or four months in a dry dock . The King Board suggested that the deck armor be bolstered and 5 in / 38 dual @-@ purpose guns be added , but the Chief of Naval Operations decreed that any major changes such as these had to wait due to the wars raging around the world at the time . The addition of bulges , however , was approved for the " Big Five " , with each ship spending three months in dry dock at the Puget Sound Naval Yard . Maryland would be first ( 17 February 1941 to 20 May ) , followed by West Virginia ( 10 May to 8 August ) , Colorado ( 28 July to 28 October ) , Tennessee ( 19 January 1942 to 21 April ) and California ( 16 March to 16 June ) . However , the estimates for how long the addition of bulges would take were too low ; Puget Sound believed that they could complete work on Maryland in 123 calendar days ( about four months ) — if the work would be given a priority equal to that of Saratoga 's refit and higher than new construction . 
 Only two of the ships had bulges added to them through this program , Maryland ( completed 1 August 1941 ) and Colorado ( 26 February 1942 ) ; the attack on Pearl Harbor interrupted the refits intended for West Virginia and the two Tennessees . The surprise strike did not touch Colorado , which was at Puget Sound , and did not hurt Maryland very badly ; however , West Virginia was severely damaged and needed a major refit at minimum . 
 Little to no major modifications were made to the two active Colorados in the opening months of the U.S. ' s entry into the war ; all of the battleships in the Pacific Fleet had a constant order to be ready to sail within 48 hours in case of a Japanese attempt to invade Hawaii or the West Coast and could not be spared for any major yard work . Colorado was hurried through the rest of her refit with the addition of essential items like radar , splinter protection , 14 Oerlikon 20 mm and four 1 @.@ 1 in light anti @-@ aircraft guns ; Maryland received a similar treatment later , the only difference being 16 20 mm 's and no 1 @.@ 1 in . Although tower masts were constructed for Colorado and Maryland and a majority of the old cage masts were cut down by the ships ' crews in the beginning of 1942 , the ships could not be spared the time needed to install the new masts . The tower masts were placed into storage and not used until early 1944 . 
 Colorado and Maryland were greatly needed in the war zone , and as such did not undergo a major refit until 1944 , although minor additions and removals , mainly to the anti @-@ aircraft weaponry , were made in @-@ between . Throughout the war , both ships saw their anti @-@ aircraft battery changed constantly . Beginning in 1942 , they carried eight 5 in / 25 , four quadruple @-@ mounted 1 @.@ 1 in guns , a greatly varying number of 20 mm , and eight .50 caliber machine guns . In June 1942 , Colorado had fourteen 20 mm ; just five months later , this was upped to twenty @-@ two , with thirty @-@ six temporarily approved for a later time . By February 1943 , both Colorado and Maryland had two more quad 1 @.@ 1 in added ( for a total of 6 ) and forty @-@ eight total 20 mm ; a month later she was given an additional ten .50 caliber machine guns . November 1943 saw the removal of two of the single @-@ purpose 5 in / 51 , the six quad 1 @.@ 1 in , and a small number of 20 mm ( six in Colorado , eight in Maryland ) in favor of thirty @-@ two Bofors 40 mm — six quad and two twin . 
 Both ships finally underwent major refits in 1944 . Here the remaining cage masts were taken off in favor of the tower masts , the two twin 40 mm replaced by quads , a quadruple 20 mm added , and a new radar fitted . Although more extensive refits were proposed by Admiral Ernest J. King , including the addition of eight twin 5 in / 38 , more advanced fire control systems , and a second protective deck plating , the Bureau of Ships , after demonstrating what would have to be removed as compensation for the weight added for King 's ideas , counter @-@ proposed that a smaller reconstruction , like the ones given to the New Mexico class , would be more desirable . However , no action was taken until Maryland was struck by a kamikaze aircraft . While undergoing repair , eight twin 5 in / 38 were added , but nothing else ; her conning tower was removed and replaced by a 50 lb ( 23 kg ) special @-@ treated steel structure to balance the additional weight of the 5 in guns .

 USS Colorado ( BB @-@ 45 ) was the third ship of the United States Navy named in honor of the 38th state . Her keel was laid down on 29 May 1919 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden , New Jersey . She was launched on 22 March 1921 and commissioned on 30 August 1923 , Captain R. R. Belknap in command . During her career , Colorado was involved in various ceremonies and fleet exercises , and assisted Long Beach residents following an earthquake there in 1933 . In 1937 , she was one of several ships that searched for Amelia Earhart after her plane went missing . Colorado was at Puget Sound at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 . 
 She returned to Pearl Harbor April 1942 . From November 1942 to September 1943 she was stationed in the South West Pacific . In November 1943 , Colorado participated in operations against the Japanese during both the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign and Mariana and Palau Islands campaign , and she shelled Luzon and Okinawa in advance of the planned amphibious assaults there . Following World War II Colorado participated in Operation Magic Carpet before being decommissioned in 1947 . She was sold for scrap in 1957 .

 USS Maryland ( BB @-@ 46 ) was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of the seventh state . Her keel was laid down 24 April 1917 by Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Newport News , Virginia . She was launched on 20 March 1920 and commissioned on 21 July 1921 , with Captain C.F. Preston in command . During her career she made a goodwill voyage to Australia and New Zealand in 1925 , and transported President @-@ elect Herbert Hoover on the Pacific leg of his tour of Latin America in 1928 . Throughout the 1920s and 1930s , she served as a mainstay of fleet readiness through tireless training operations . 
 In 1940 , Maryland changed her base of operations to Pearl Harbor . She was present at Battleship Row along Ford Island during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 . Damaged during the attack , Maryland reported to the Puget Sound Navy Yard , where she was repaired and modernized . Maryland supported the amphibious landings during the Battle of Tarawa , and thereafter participated in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign , the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign , the Battle of Peleliu , the Philippines Campaign , and the Battle of Okinawa . Following the end of World War II Maryland participated in Operation Magic Carpet before decommissioning in 1947 . She was sold for scrap in 1959 .

 USS Washington ( BB @-@ 47 ) was the second ship of the United States Navy named in honor of the 42nd state . Her keel was laid down on 30 June 1919 at Camden , New Jersey , by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation . She was launched on 1 September 1921 , but on 8 February 1922 , two days after the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armaments , all construction work ceased on the 75 @.@ 9 % completed dreadnought . 
 The ship was towed out in November 1924 to be used as a gunnery target . On the first day of testing , the ship was hit by two 400 @-@ pound ( 180 kg ) torpedoes and three 1 short ton ( 0 @.@ 91 t ) near @-@ miss bombs with minor damage and a list of three degrees . On that day , the ship had 400 pounds of TNT detonated on board , but she remained afloat . Two days later , the ship was hit by fourteen 14 @-@ inch ( 360 mm ) shells dropped from 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) , but only one penetrated . The ship was finally sunk by the battleships New York and Texas with fourteen 14 in shells . After the test , it was decided that the existing deck armor on battleships was inadequate , and that future battleships should be fitted with triple bottoms .

 USS West Virginia ( BB @-@ 48 ) was the second ship of the United States Navy named in honor of the 35th state . Her keel was laid down on 12 April 1920 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Newport News , Virginia . She was launched on 17 November 1921 and commissioned on 1 December 1923 , Captain Thomas J. Senn in command . Despite a grounding incident early in her career West Virginia received high acclaim for gunnery and armor protection , and was involved in exercises to test the defenses of the Hawaiian Islands in the 1930s . On the morning of 7 December 1941 , West Virginia sustained heavy damage , but thanks in large part to counter flooding orders the battleship sank at her berth on an even keel , which is similar to that of California . Resurrected from the mud on 17 May 1942 , West Virginia received enough patchwork to sail for Washington State ; she entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in 1942 for repairs and modernization . 
 In July 1944 she emerged from her repairs and overhaul , and set out to rejoin the Pacific Fleet for combat operations . She joined the fleet on the eve of the Philippines Campaign . There she participated in the Battle of Surigao Strait , the last battleship vs battleship duel of World War II , where her new Mk . 8 fire @-@ control radar allowed her to hit the Yamashiro with her first salvo - in the dark - at 22 @,@ 800 yards ( 20 @,@ 800 m ) . In February 1945 West Virginia participated in the Battle of Iwo Jima , initially by preinvasion bombardment , and later by <unk> support for the ground forces on the island . Her last combat operations were during the Battle of Okinawa ; after the surrender of Japan , she was called upon to participate in Operation Magic Carpet . Decommissioned in 1947 , she was sold for scrapping in 1959 . 
 = Kuala Terengganu = 
 Kuala Terengganu ( Malaysian pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] Jawi : <unk> <unk> , Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) colloquially abbreviated as K.T. ) is the administrative capital , royal capital , district and the main economic centre of Terengganu , Malaysia . Kuala Terengganu is also the administrative centre for the eponymous district of Kuala Terengganu . Kuala Terengganu is located about 440 kilometres northeast of Kuala Lumpur on the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia . The city is situated at the estuary of Terengganu River , facing the South China Sea . 
 As a district , Kuala Terengganu is the smallest in terms of area , but it ( together with the district of Kuala Nerus that form the city area ) has the largest population in Terengganu with a population of 406 @,@ 317 in 2010 . City status was awarded to Kuala Terengganu with the title Bandaraya Warisan <unk> Air ( English : Coastal Heritage City ) on 1 January 2008 . 
 Besides being a major political and economic centre to the state , the city is also the main gateway to many of the state 's tourist destinations . The attractions in and around the city include Kampung Cina , Pasar Besar <unk> Payang , Terengganu State Museum , and Batu Buruk Beach . Even though the city is not spared from modernity and development , Kuala Terengganu still retains strong Malay influences that are intermixed with other cultures from its long history as a port . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 In Malay , <unk> can have the meanings of " river mouth " , " estuary " , or " confluence " . Thus , the name Kuala Terengganu is roughly translated as " the confluence / estuary of Terengganu " , referring to the broad expanse of the Terengganu River estuary which empties into the South China Sea . There are several theories regarding the name Terengganu . One such theory attributes the name 's origin to <unk> <unk> , Malay for ' bright rainbow ' . Another story , which is considered to be the most popular version , is said to have been originally narrated by the ninth Sultan of Terengganu , Baginda Omar . It tells of a party of hunters from Pahang roving and hunting in the area of what is now southern Terengganu . One of the hunters spotted a big animal fang lying on the ground . A fellow party member asked to which animal did the fang belong . The hunter , not knowing which animal , simply answered <unk> anu ( Malay : ' fang of something ' ) . The party later returned to Pahang with a rich hoard of game , fur and sandalwood , which impressed their neighbours . They asked the hunters where did they source their riches , to which they replied , from the land of <unk> anu , which later evolved into Terengganu . 
 = = History = = 
 Among the earliest references of Terengganu are in Chinese historical sources . A Chinese writer ’ s note during the Sui dynasty has mentioned about a state named Tan @-@ Tan that sent tributes to China . The state was presumably located somewhere in Terengganu . Tan @-@ Tan sent tributes to Sui dynasty and then to the Tang dynasty after Sui dynasty has collapsed . It ceased to send tributes to China after it came under the dominance of the Srivijaya during the 7th century . Chinese history books such as Ling @-@ wai @-@ dai @-@ da ( <unk> ) written by Zhou Qufei ( <unk> ) in 1178 and the book Zhu fan zhi ( also romanised as Chu @-@ <unk> ) written by Zhao <unk> ( <unk> ; also romanised as Chau Ju @-@ <unk> ) in 1226 mentioned Teng @-@ ya @-@ nu and Teng @-@ ya @-@ nung respectively , as being a vassal state of San @-@ fo @-@ ts ’ i ( <unk> ) , which is thought to be Srivijaya . After Srivijaya fell during the 13th century , Terengganu came under the influence of Majapahit . In the 15th century , Majapahit was vying with Ayutthaya Kingdom and the nascent Malacca Sultanate for the control of the Malay Peninsula . Malacca Sultanate prevailed and Terengganu then came under its influence . When the Malacca Sultanate fell in 1511 to the Portuguese , the newly established Sultanate of Johor exerted its influence on most of the former territories of the Malacca Sultanate , including Terengganu . Terengganu was briefly under the influence of the Aceh Sultanate during the early 17th century , but Johor managed to exert its influence again on Terengganu in the late 17th century . 
 The present Sultanate of Terengganu was established in the 1708 . The first Sultan of Terengganu , Sultan Zainal Abidin I established his court near Kuala <unk> , then he moved his court a few more times until he settled near Bukit <unk> , Kuala Terengganu . During the early 18th century , Kuala Terengganu was still a small town . It was described as having about one thousand houses that were scattered around the town . The Chinese were already present in Kuala Terengganu at that time . Half of the population were Chinese and they were engaged in agriculture and trading . After the death of Sultan Daud in 1831 , a brief civil war erupted between two claimants to the throne , namely Tengku Mansur and Tengku Omar . Tengku Omar was based at Bukit Puteri while Tengku Mansur was based at Balik Bukit . Tengku Omar was defeated by Tengku Mansur and he fled from Terengganu . Tengku Mansur became the next Sultan as Sultan Mansur II . His son , Sultan Muhammad succeeded him as the next Sultan after his death in 1837 . However , in 1839 , Tengku Omar returned to Terengganu with his entourage to reclaim the throne . He defeated Sultan Muhammad and forced Sultan Muhammad to flee . Tengku Omar reoccupied his fort at Bukit Puteri and was throned as the next Sultan , Sultan Omar . 
 In 1862 , ex @-@ Sultan of Riau @-@ Lingga , Sultan Mahmud IV Muzaffar Shah went to Terengganu from Bangkok on a Siamese vessel . The British requested that the ex @-@ Sultan to be withdrawn because the British accused the ex @-@ Sultan and also the Sultan of Terengganu , Sultan Omar of supporting Wan Ahmad . Wan Ahmad had constantly attacked Pahang using <unk> as his base and British trade there were disrupted by the constant attacks . The Siamese agreed to British request , but they have yet to follow through with their agreement . The Strait Settlements Governor , Sir <unk> Cavenagh sent three ships , HMS Scout , HMS Coquette and a steamer <unk> to Kuala Terengganu , under the command of Captain Corbett , accompanied by Major MacPherson . They were sent with orders to compel the ex @-@ Sultan of Riau @-@ Lingga to be sent back by the British to Siam , and to call upon the Sultan to cease supporting Wan Ahmad . After the Sultan of Terengganu declined to surrender the ex @-@ Sultan to the British , the ships bombarded Kuala Terengganu . The Sultan of Terengganu and the ex @-@ Sultan had fled Kuala Terengganu during the bombardment . The ships then returned to Singapore . Kuala Terengganu was ravaged by a fire in 1882 . The fire that swept through Kuala Terengganu destroyed many buildings , including Green Palace ( Istana Hijau ) , the Sultan ’ s palace . Maziah Palace ( Istana Maziah ) was later built to replace the destroyed palace . 
 Kuala Terengganu continued to be Terengganu 's capital when it was still a vassal state of Siam and during the early years of British colonisation of Malaya . Terengganu fell under the administration of Britain through the Bangkok Treaty of 1909 and was forced to accept a resident " British advisor " . Terengganu , along with four other states were grouped under the term of Unfederated Malay States . British maintained its rule on Terengganu except during the Japanese occupation in World War II . In 1957 , Malaya achieved its independence , and subsequently in 1963 , Malaya , North Borneo ( now the state of Sabah ) , Sarawak , and Singapore merge to form Malaysia . On 18 January 1979 , Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council was established to oversee the development of the town . The Municipal Council was upgraded to Kuala Terengganu City Council on 1 January 2008 .

 The city is administered by Kuala Terengganu City Council , which covers the whole area of Kuala Terengganu district . The district 's location at the estuary of Terengganu River divided the district into two parts , Kuala Terengganu Utara ( North Kuala Terengganu ) , now known as Kuala Nerus , and Kuala Terengganu Selatan ( South Kuala Terengganu ) , which is considered to be Kuala Terengganu proper . As the capital , the city is vital to the political and economic welfare of the state . It is the centre for the state and federal government agencies administration buildings , housing the offices of many ministries ' departments and governmental bodies , such as the Immigration and Customs Department , State Economic Planning Unit , Pos Malaysia Kuala Terengganu General Post Office , Terengganu State Library , and many others . As the administrative capital of Terengganu , the Legislative Assembly convenes at Wisma Darul Iman , the state secretariat building . Kuala Terengganu is also the royal capital of the state , being the site of the Sultan 's many palaces , for example Istana <unk> and Istana Maziah . 
 The Election Commission of Malaysia has divided Kuala Terengganu into two different parliament constituencies : <unk> for Kuala Nerus , and <unk> for Kuala Terengganu . There are four state assembly districts in each Parliament . They are :

 Kuala Terengganu was first designated as a local government area in 1928 through the Municipal and Health Enactment 1928 . At this time , the area only covered a small part of the current city border , specifically the historic core around the river mouth . The area , nevertheless , was enlarged slowly . In 1950 , the town was administrated by Kuala Terengganu Town Board under section 51 ( 1 ) , the Local Authority Election Ordinance 1950 . Like many other town boards at that time , the process of town planning was carried out according to the Town Board Enactment 1930 . Until 1979 , the town continued to be managed by Kuala Terengganu Town Board that governed an area of 5 @.@ 4 square miles ( 1 @,@ 398 @.@ 6 hectares ) , with a population of around 53 @,@ 300 people . Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council ( MPKT ) was established due to the development that spilled over to the areas outside the jurisdiction of the former Town Board . MPKT was established on 18 January 1979 under the enforcement of the Local Government Act 1976 . MPKT was created through the amalgamation of Kuala Terengganu Town Board and four local councils ( North KT , South KT , West KT , and Central KT ) with an area of 18 @,@ 712 hectares covering 21 mukim or sub @-@ districts , including some parts of Northern Kuala Terengganu . 
 On 1 January 1985 , the sub @-@ districts of Bukit Palos and <unk> <unk> were removed from the Council and placed under the administration of <unk> District Council . With these changes , the area under the Council 's administration was reduced to 16 @,@ 806 hectares . On 16 December 1996 , Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council was extended to cover the entire area of Kuala Terengganu district back then , including the resort island , Redang Island . With that , the number of the sub @-@ districts increased to 23 while the area increased dramatically to 60 @,@ 528 hectares . On 1 January 2008 , a declaration was made by the state government and Kuala Terengganu became the first city on the East Coast region of Peninsular Malaysia to achieve city status . Kuala Terengganu Municipal Council changed its name to Kuala Terengganu City Council ( MBKT ) to reflect the change of its status . On 18 September 2014 , the northern part of Kuala Terengganu ( formerly called as Northern Kuala Terengganu ) was declared as the state 's newest district with the name of Kuala Nerus . This however does not mean a creation of a new local government area as Kuala Nerus is still under the jurisdiction of MBKT . 
 As the local council for the districts of Kuala Terengganu and Kuala Nerus , and an agency under the Terengganu state government , MBKT is responsible for public health and sanitation , waste removal and management , town planning and beautification , environmental protection and building control , social , economic and tourism development , and general maintenance and constructions of urban infrastructure . The MBKT main headquarters is located at Menara <unk> in Jalan Sultan Ismail . There are two districts that are administered by MBKT . They are Kuala Terengganu and Kuala Nerus . Kuala Nerus was formerly a part of Kuala Terengganu district , but on 18 September 2014 , the Malaysian Prime Minister , Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak declared this northern part of Kuala Terengganu district as the eighth and newest district in Terengganu state . 
 With a population or over 200 @,@ 000 and a size of 39 @,@ 890 hectares , it comprises a substantial part of the former larger Kuala Terengganu district . Significant development in the areas of higher education and housing projects have occurred there in contemporary times . The main population centres of Kuala Nerus include <unk> and Batu <unk> . Among major education institutions located in this district are Universiti Malaysia Terengganu , Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin , The Institute of Teacher Education Dato <unk> Ismail Campus and an industrial training institute . The Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin ( <unk> ) Teaching Hospital is now under construction , thus providing this district with a new establishment . The Sultan Mahmud Airport is located within the district , as is the multipurpose Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium . Although Kuala Nerus and Kuala Terengganu are now two districts on their own , since both of them are under the administration of the same local government , this makes MBKT among the few local governments in Malaysia to manage two different districts . 
 The mukim or sub @-@ districts under MBKT are : 
 = = Geography = = 
 The eastern part of Terengganu district that faces the South China Sea is characterised by sandy coastal beaches that cover the entire stretch of both parts . Small bays and coastal plains can be found . The district is divided into four major drainage basins : Terengganu River basin , Nerus River basin , Ibai River basin , and other small rivers basin . Certain parts of the rivers of Kuala Terengganu are lined with swamp forests . Hills between 200 – 600 metres mostly dominate the western part of the district , with more than 70 % of the district made up of lowlands less than 20 metres high because of its geographical proximity to the coast . The city itself has a few high points with the highest being Bukit Besar , followed by Bukit Kecil . Bukit Puteri is centrally located in the city , just near the Terengganu River estuary . The lowlands provide the district with suitable areas for plantations such as paddy , palm oil trees , and rubber trees . 
 The Redang archipelago is a group of islands in which two , the main island of Redang and <unk> Island , are inhabited , and the other smaller islands are not ( Ling Island , <unk> <unk> Island , Lima Island , Paku Island , Paku Kecil Island , <unk> Island , and <unk> Kecil Island ) . The Redang Islands are located 45 kilometres away from Kuala Terengganu in the South China Sea . Together these islands contain around 500 species of corals and the thousands of fish and invertebrates . The islands are designated as a marine park in 1994 . In Malaysia , a marine park is established to protect and manage the marine ecosystem and give people the opportunities to enjoy the underwater heritage . The Redang Islands are composed mainly of granite and sedimentary rocks that are metamorphosed . The main river is Redang River . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 As a part of Terengganu , Kuala Terengganu has a tropical rainforest climate under the Köppen climate classification ( Af ) with constant temperature and high humidity . The amount of rainfall varies according to the monsoon season . It is generally fairly hot and humid all year round , averaging from 28 ° C to 30 ° C in daytime and slightly cooler after dusk . Nevertheless , the sea breeze from South China Sea <unk> moderates the humidity in offshore areas while the altitude and lush forest trees and plant has cooled the mountain and rural areas . 
 There are two main types of monsoons in the state . The southwest monsoon season is usually established in the later half of May or early June and ends in September . The prevailing wind flow is generally southwesterly and light , below 15 knots . The northeast monsoon season usually starts in early November and ends in March . During this season , steady easterly or northeasterly winds of 10 to 20 knots prevail . The winds over the east coast states of Peninsular Malaysia may reach 30 knots or more during periods of strong surges of cold air from the north ( cold surges ) . The annual rainfall of this area is 2 @,@ 911 millimetres . During the northeast monsoon season , Kuala Terengganu , being exposed to the coast , receives heavy rainfall . It is not advised to visit any of the offshore islands or participating in sea activities as the sea can be very rough . However , in some clear sunny days during the monsoon season , surprisingly east coast is always presented with clear blue sky and cooling wind .

 In the 19th century , Thomas John Newbold , an English soldier working for the East India Company , estimated the population of Kuala Terengganu to be around 15 @,@ 000 to 20 @,@ 000 Malays with 600 Chinese , but it was presumably an overestimation . There were few brick buildings in the town . The principal brick buildings were a mosque and a custom house . Most of the houses were made of wood and thatch . The Chinese settlement in Kuala Terengganu , Kampung Cina , had become an old and established settlement . Most of the houses and shops in Kampung Cina were made of stone and brick .

 = HMS Indefatigable ( 1909 ) = 
 HMS Indefatigable was a battlecruiser of the Royal Navy and the lead ship of her class . Her keel was laid down in 1909 and she was commissioned in 1911 . She was an enlarged version of the earlier Invincible class with a revised protection scheme and additional length amidships to allow her two middle turrets to fire on either broadside . 
 When the First World War began , Indefatigable was serving with the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron ( BCS ) in the Mediterranean , where she unsuccessfully pursued the battlecruiser Goeben and the light cruiser Breslau of the German Imperial Navy as they fled towards the Ottoman Empire . The ship bombarded Ottoman fortifications defending the Dardanelles on 3 November 1914 , then , following a refit in Malta , returned to the United Kingdom in February where she rejoined the 2nd BCS . 
 Indefatigable was sunk on 31 May 1916 during the Battle of Jutland , the largest naval battle of the war . Part of Vice @-@ Admiral Sir David Beatty 's Battlecruiser Fleet , she was hit several times in the first minutes of the " Run to the South " , the opening phase of the battlecruiser action . Shells from the German battlecruiser Von der Tann caused an explosion ripping a hole in her hull , and a second explosion hurled large pieces of the ship 200 feet ( 60 m ) in the air . Only two of the crew of 1 @,@ 019 survived . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 No battlecruisers were ordered after the three Invincible @-@ class ships in 1905 until Indefatigable became the lone battlecruiser of the 1908 – 09 Naval Programme . A new Liberal Government had taken power in January 1906 and demanded reductions in naval spending , and the Admiralty submitted a reduced programme , requesting dreadnoughts but no battlecruisers . The Cabinet rejected this proposal in favour of two outmoded armoured cruisers but finally acceded to a request for one battlecruiser instead , after the Admiralty pointed out the need to match the recently published German naval construction plan and to maintain the heavy gun and armour industries . Indefatigable 's outline design was prepared in March 1908 , and the final design , slightly larger than Invincible with a revised protection arrangement , was approved in November 1908 . A larger design with more armour and better underwater protection was rejected as too expensive . Note ; plan is of Invincible @-@ class battlecruisers ; the Indefatigable @-@ class has a third superstructure element with ' P ' & ' Q ' turrets more widely spaced . 
 The ship had an overall length of 590 feet ( 179 @.@ 8 m ) , a beam of 80 feet ( 24 @.@ 4 m ) , and a draught of 29 feet 9 inches ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) at deep load . She normally displaced 18 @,@ 500 long tons ( 18 @,@ 800 t ) and 22 @,@ 130 long tons ( 22 @,@ 490 t ) at deep load . Her turbines were designed to produce a total of 43 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 32 @,@ 000 kW ) , but reached over 55 @,@ 000 shp ( 41 @,@ 000 kW ) during sea trials in 1911 . She was designed for 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) , but reached 26 @.@ 89 knots ( 49 @.@ 80 km / h ; 30 @.@ 94 mph ) during trials . 
 Indefatigable 's main armament was eight breech @-@ loading BL 12 @-@ inch Mark X guns mounted in four hydraulically powered twin turrets . Two turrets were mounted fore and aft on the centreline , identified as ' A ' and ' X ' respectively . The other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally : ' P ' was forward and to port of the centre funnel , while ' Q ' was situated starboard and aft . ' P ' and ' Q ' turrets had some limited ability to fire to the opposite side . Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL 4 @-@ inch Mark VII guns positioned in the superstructure . She mounted two 17 @.@ 72 @-@ inch ( 450 mm ) submerged torpedo tubes , one on each side aft of ' X ' barbette , and twelve torpedoes were carried . 
 Indefatigable was unique among British battlecruisers in having an armoured spotting and signal tower behind the conning tower , protected by 4 inches ( 102 mm ) of armour . However , the spotting tower was of limited use , as its view was obscured by the conning tower in front of it and the legs of the foremast and superstructure behind it . During a pre @-@ war refit , a 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) rangefinder was added to the rear of the ' A ' turret roof , and this turret was equipped to control the entire main armament as an emergency backup for the normal fire @-@ control positions . 
 = = = Wartime modifications = = = 
 Indefatigable received a single QF 3 @-@ inch 20 cwt anti @-@ aircraft gun on a high @-@ angle Mark II mount in March 1915 . It was provided with 500 rounds . All of her 4 @-@ inch guns were enclosed in casemates and given gun shields during a refit in November 1915 to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action , although two aft guns were removed at the same time . 
 She received a fire @-@ control director between mid @-@ 1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire control under the director officer who now fired the guns . The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target . This greatly increased accuracy since the ship 's roll no longer dispersed the shells as each turret fired on its own ; also , the fire @-@ control director could more easily spot the fall of the shells .

 = = = Early career = = = 
 Indefatigable was laid down at the Devonport Dockyard , Plymouth on 23 February 1909 . She was launched on 28 October 1909 and was completed on 24 February 1911 . Upon commissioning , Indefatigable served in the 1st Cruiser Squadron , which in January 1913 was renamed the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron ( BCS ) . In December 1913 , she transferred to the Mediterranean , where she joined the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron . 
 = = = Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau = = = 
 Indefatigable , accompanied by the battlecruiser Indomitable and under the command of Admiral Sir Berkeley Milne , encountered the German battlecruiser Goeben and the light cruiser Breslau on the morning of 4 August 1914 , which were headed east after a cursory bombardment of the French Algerian port of Philippeville . Britain and Germany were not yet at war , so Milne turned to shadow the Germans as they headed back to Messina to re @-@ coal . All three battlecruisers had problems with their boilers , but Goeben and Breslau were able to break contact and reached Messina by the morning of the 5th . By this time Germany had invaded Belgium and war had been declared , but an Admiralty order to respect Italian neutrality and stay more than six miles ( 10 km ) from the Italian coast precluded entering the Strait of Messina , from which they could have observed the port directly . Therefore , Milne stationed Inflexible and Indefatigable at the northern exit of the strait , expecting the Germans to break out to the west where they could attack French troop transports . He stationed the light cruiser Gloucester at the southern exit , and sent Indomitable to coal at Bizerte , where she was ready for action in the Western Mediterranean . 
 The Germans sortied from Messina on 6 August and headed east , towards Constantinople , trailed by Gloucester . Milne , still expecting Rear @-@ Admiral Wilhelm Souchon to turn west , kept the battlecruisers at Malta until shortly after midnight on 8 August when he set sail at a leisurely 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) for Cape Matapan , where Goeben had been spotted eight hours earlier . At 2 : 30 p.m. he received an incorrect message from the Admiralty stating that Britain was at war with Austria @-@ Hungary . War would not actually be declared until 12 August , and the order was countermanded four hours later , but Milne gave up the hunt for Goeben , following his standing orders to guard the Adriatic against an Austrian break @-@ out attempt . On 9 August Milne was given clear orders to " chase Goeben which had passed Cape Matapan on the 7th steering north @-@ east . " Milne still did not believe that Souchon was heading for the Dardanelles , and so he resolved to guard the exit from the Aegean , unaware that the Goeben did not intend to come out . 
 On 3 November 1914 , Winston Churchill , then First Lord of the Admiralty , ordered the first British attack on the Dardanelles following the commencement of hostilities between Ottoman Turkey and Russia . The attack was carried out by Indomitable and Indefatigable , as well as the French pre @-@ dreadnought battleships Suffren and Vérité . The intention of the attack was to test the fortifications and measure the Turkish response . The results were deceptively encouraging . In a twenty @-@ minute bombardment , a single shell struck the magazine of the fort at Sedd el Bahr at the tip of the Gallipoli peninsula , displacing ( but not destroying ) 10 guns and killing 86 Turkish soldiers . The most significant consequence was that the attention of the Turks was drawn to strengthening their defences , and they set about expanding the mine field . This attack actually took place before Britain 's formal declaration of war on 6 November against the Ottoman Empire . Indefatigable remained in the Mediterranean until she was relieved by Inflexible on 24 January 1915 and proceeded to Malta for a refit ; she then sailed to England on 14 February and joined the 2nd BCS upon her arrival . The ship conducted uneventful patrols of the North Sea for the next year and a half . She was the temporary flagship of the 2nd BCS during April – May 1916 , while her half @-@ sister HMAS Australia was under repair after colliding with Indefatigable 's other half @-@ sister HMS New Zealand . 
 = = = Battle of Jutland = = = 
 On 31 May 1916 , the 2nd BCS consisted of New Zealand ( flagship of Rear @-@ Admiral William Pakenham ) and Indefatigable . The squadron was assigned to Admiral Beatty 's Battlecruiser Fleet which had put to sea to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea . The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea . Admiral Franz von Hipper 's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 3 : 20 p.m. , but Beatty 's ships did not spot the Germans to their east until 3 : 30 . Two minutes later , he ordered a course change to east south @-@ east to position himself astride the German 's line of retreat and called his ships ' crews to action stations . He also ordered the 2nd BCS , which had been leading , to fall in astern of the 1st BCS . Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard , away from the British , to assume a south @-@ easterly course , and to reduce speed to 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up . With this turn Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet , then about 60 miles ( 97 km ) behind him . Around this time Beatty altered course to the east as it was quickly apparent that he was still too far north to cut off Hipper . 
 This began what was to be called the " Run to the South " as Beatty changed course to steer east south @-@ east at 3 : 45 , paralleling Hipper 's course , now that the range closed to under 18 @,@ 000 yards ( 16 @,@ 000 m ) . The Germans opened fire first at 3 : 48 , followed by the British . The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships , Lion and Princess Royal , had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire . The British formation was echeloned to the right with Indefatigable in the rear and furthest to the west , and New Zealand ahead of her and slightly further east . The German fire was accurate from the beginning , but the British overestimated the range as the German ships blended into the haze . Indefatigable aimed at Von der Tann and New Zealand targeted Moltke while remaining unengaged herself . By 3 : 54 , the range was down to 12 @,@ 900 yards ( 11 @,@ 800 m ) and Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 3 : 57 . 
 Around 4 : 00 , Indefatigable was hit around the rear turret by two or three shells from Von der Tann . She fell out of formation to starboard and started sinking towards the stern and listing to port . Her magazines exploded at 4 : 03 after more hits , one on the forecastle and another on the forward turret . Smoke and flames gushed from the forward part of the ship and large pieces were thrown 200 feet ( 61 @.@ 0 m ) into the air . The most likely cause of her loss was a deflagration or low @-@ order explosion in ' X ' magazine that blew out her bottom and severed the steering control shafts , followed by the explosion of her forward magazines from the second volley . Von der Tann fired only fifty @-@ two 28 cm ( 11 in ) shells at Indefatigable before she exploded . Of her crew of 1 @,@ 019 , only two survived . While still in the water , two survivors found Indefatigable 's captain , C. F. Sowerby , who was badly wounded and died before they could be rescued . The two survivors , Able Seaman Frederick Arthur Gordon Elliott and Leading Signalman Charles Farmer , were rescued by the German torpedo boat S16 . A third survivor , Signalman John Bowyer , was picked up by another unknown German ship . He was incorrectly reported as a crew member from HMS Nestor in " The Times " on 24 June 1916 .

 Tony Stewart appeared in victory lane after his victory lap to start celebrating his first win of the season , and his third at Atlanta Motor Speedway , in front of a crowd of 93 @,@ 200 people . After breaking a thirty @-@ one race losing streak , Stewart stated on the team 's radio , " Ring the bell baby , woo ! Good job , guys ! You got it done , that 's the only way we had a shot . You guys won this thing in the pits . " He also added , " I 've never been so happy to win in my life . " 
 Although , Denny Hamlin lead the most laps in the first half of the race , his engine failed , and sent him to the garage for the rest of the race . He said , " It ’ s frustrating . I know if we had the reliability that we could win this championship and the odds would be pretty good to win the championship if I can just keep it together for 10 weeks . " In the subsequent press conference , Stewart said , " It ’ s been a long time since we have been in victory lane . So it ’ s something we are not used to ; luckily , we have had the good fortune to not normally go this long without a win . But we had an awesome race car tonight . This thing , it was balanced off the start of the race , and you know , I knew the first run when we were a little bit off , and the leaders were not getting away from us , I thought , we have probably got a shot at this thing tonight and a shot at a solid Top 5 or Top 3 , but once we got a couple of runs in there , and it was Denny and I trading spots back and forth . " He continued by saying : 
 " It was fun racing with him like that . We gave each other room . Whoever got caught in traffic , the other guy got the lead back . It was fun switching the lead . We struggled on restarts or I struggled on restarts , Darian wasn ’ t driving the car , so I can ’ t blame it on him . I struggled on restarts all night . Finally the last two , I hit it a lot closer and kept them from spinning quite as bad . The pit crew is who we have got to give all the credit to tonight . They had an awesome pit stop the last time we came in that got us that track position that I lost on the previous restart . So you know , without that , I don ’ t think we would have a shot to be here tonight . " 
 Ryan Newman discussed his contact with Kahne by explaining , " Yeah , the No. 18 ( Kyle Busch ) hit me the same time I hit the No. 9 ( Kahne ) — it was within a millisecond . I was trying to push him to get ahead of the No. 2 car ( Kurt Busch ) and it didn ’ t work out . We ’ ve seen this several times this year , and it was me trying to help him out . It causes accidents once in a while . It hurt him but in the grand scheme of things he tried to hurt me and it didn ’ t hurt us as bad . So , we ’ ll just go on . " Stewart also stated , " When you have a car that ’ s that good , it ’ s not good to lose those spots like that . ... We got caught back there one time and we struggled getting that track position back . But when you have a car that ’ s that fast , it ’ s nice . You don ’ t feel like you ’ re in too much trouble when you lose a couple of spots on a restart like that . "

 = Hale Commission = 
 The Hale Commission was established by the Commonwealth of England on 30 January 1652 and led by Sir Matthew Hale to investigate law reform . Consisting of eight lawyers and thirteen laymen , the Commission met approximately three times a week and proposed changes as radical ( at the time ) as reducing the use of the death penalty , allowing witnesses , legal aid and lawyers for defendants in criminal cases and creating County Courts and a Court of Appeal for criminal cases . Though the Commission was unsuccessful at passing any of its measures under the Rump Parliament , two of its measures were put into law by the subsequent Barebone 's Parliament , and , by the middle of the 20th century , most of the others were as well . Debate has occurred over the effectiveness and strife within the Commission between its more moderate and radical members ; the general conclusion is that with the sheer volume of work produced and the vast proportion of moderate to radical members , it is unlikely such strife existed . 
 = = Background and establishment = = 
 The loss of Charles I of England in the English Civil War led to the establishment of the Commonwealth of England on 19 May 1649 . During the rule of both the Commonwealth and the succeeding Protectorate , there was considerable desire for law reform . Many judges and lawyers were corrupt , and criminal law followed no real reason or philosophy . Any felony was punishable by death , proceedings were in a form of Norman French , and judges regularly imprisoned jurors for reaching a verdict they disagreed with . Cromwell and the Rump Parliament aimed to establish a " new society " , which included reforming the law ; to that end , on 30 January 1652 Sir Matthew Hale was appointed chairman of a commission to investigate law reform , which soon became known as the Hale Commission . The Commission 's official remit was defined by the Commons ; " taking into consideration what inconveniences there are in the law ; and how the mischiefs which grow from delays , the <unk> and irregularities in the proceedings in the law may be prevented , and the speediest way to reform the same , and to present their opinions to such committee as the Parliament shall appoint " . 
 The Commission consisted of eight lawyers and thirteen laymen , appointed by the Rump Parliament on 26 December 1651 , and sat from 23 January 1652 approximately three times a week in the chamber of the House of Lords . No Members of Parliament were allowed to sit . In addition to Hale , members included John Desborough , John Rushworth , Hugh Peters , Anthony Cooper , John Sadler , John Fountaine , William Steele , Henry Blount , William Roberts , Josiah <unk> , Samuel Moyer , Charles George Cock and Matthew Thomlinson . 
 = = Recommendations = = 
 The Commission recommended various changes . On the criminal law side , they supported reducing the use of the death penalty , although " wilful murderers " were still to be executed , and the abduction of a child under 16 was to be considered a capital crime . They also suggested allowing prisoners access to lawyers in any case where the prosecution was permitted representation and allowing witnesses for the defence to give evidence under oath . Legal aid was also considered , although the rejection of a case where legal aid was given would result in the defendant being sent to a workhouse for a month and whipped . The abolition of peine forte et dure as a way to avoid the forfeiture of land was also proposed . 
 For legal system reform , the Commission suggested the creation of county courts led by the Westminster judges with jurisdiction over civil actions , and small claims courts for amounts under £ 4 to be manned by commissioners , approved by Justices of the Peace . They also supported the creation of a Court of Appeal consisting of laymen chosen by Parliament , the formation of a land registry and a permanent law commission . Against Hale 's wishes , the Commission called for the abolition of benefit of clergy , and the acquittal of those charged with justified homicide . The Commission also suggested that debtors should no longer be imprisoned , and attorneys should be educated at an Inn of Court and not allowed to practise until they were admitted as members . 
 = = Disestablishment = = 
 None of the Commission 's recommendations ever made it into law under the Rump Parliament , though the Commission did produce 16 bills . Several were read in the House of Commons , and the remainder given to the Parliamentary Law Committee in July 1652 following the Committee 's dissolution on 23 July . The Rump Parliament 's successor , the Barebone 's Parliament , brought two of the Commission 's suggestions ( to abolish fines for original writs and to develop procedures for civil marriages ) into force through statutes . Most of the Commission 's suggestions were , at some point , followed . In 1837 the use of the death penalty was curtailed , and it was finally abolished in 1969 . From 1702 onwards , witnesses were allowed for the defence , and the Prisoners ' Counsel Act 1836 allowed legal representation for the defendants . The use of peine forte et dure was abolished in 1741 , and the benefit of clergy in 1827 . A permanent Law Commission was finally established with the Law Commissions Act 1965 . County Courts were finally established in 1846 , and a Court of Criminal Appeal in 1907 . 
 Academic debate over the Commission 's value has been strong . On the one hand , William Holdsworth wrote that the Commission was riven by strife between its lawyerly members and those of a more radical nature , and that its proposals were sometimes extreme . Other academics argued that the reform scheme was of great merit , and Hostettler , writes that " there is no evidence to confirm the belief of Sir William Holdsworth that the lawyers had a difficult time with the laymen " . Mary Cotterell , writing in the English Historical Review , notes that 13 of the 21 members were certainly not radicals , although Moyer and <unk> , Blount and Peters certainly were . The lawyers , all moderates , nevertheless dominated the discussions . Debate was on a highly technical level which prevented many of the laymen contributing much , although six of them had been educated at the Inns of Court . The large number of meetings and sheer volume of work produced also suggests that there was little dissent and argument . John Hostettler , in his biography of Hale , has suggested that if the measures had been put into law immediately , " we would have been honouring such pioneers for their farsightedness in enhancing our legal system and the concept of justice " . 
 = Commelina communis = 
 Commelina communis , commonly known as the Asiatic dayflower , is an herbaceous annual plant in the dayflower family . It gets its name because the blooms last for only one day . It is native throughout much of East Asia and northern parts of Southeast Asia . In China , the plant is known as <unk> ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) , roughly translating to " <unk> herb " , while in Japan it is known as <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) , meaning " dew herb " . It has also been introduced to parts of central and southeastern Europe and much of eastern North America , where it has spread to become a noxious weed . It is common in disturbed sites and in moist soil . The flowers emerge from summer through fall and are distinctive with two relatively large blue petals and one very reduced white petal . 
 The Asiatic dayflower plant serves as the type species for its large genus . Linnaeus picked the name Commelina in honour of the two Dutch botanists of the <unk> family , using the two large showy petals of Commelina communis to symbolise them . Linnaeus described the species in the first edition of his landmark work , Species Plantarum , in 1753 . Long before the plant was studied in Europe , however , it had been used for generations in traditional Chinese medicine . The flowers have also been used in Japan to produce a dye and a pigment that was used in many world @-@ renowned Ukiyo @-@ e woodcuts from the 18th and early 19th centuries . In the modern era the plant has found limited use as a model organism in the field of plant physiology due to its complex pigment chemistry and the ease of viewing its stomata . 
 The Asiatic dayflower is considered a weed both in areas where it was introduced and in certain parts of its native range . The flowers ' interactions with pollinators have been well studied and have helped to support important hypotheses about pollination in the field of plant ecology . Recent research has also revealed that the Asiatic dayflower can bioaccumulate a number of metals , making it a candidate for <unk> and essentially cleaning spoiled copper mines . Several animals and fungi use the plant as a food source , with a few species feeding upon it exclusively . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Asiatic dayflower is an annual herb with stems that are typically <unk> , meaning that they are prostrate at the base but become erect towards the tips , but some individuals may be simply erect . The diffusely branched stems tend to root at the basal nodes . The pubescence on the stems is variable , but common patterns include a line of hair continuous with the leaf sheath , or they may be glabrous basally , meaning hairless , and puberulent towards the extremities , that is covered with fine hairs . The leaves are sessile : they lack a leaf stalk , also known as a petiole ; or they may be <unk> , meaning they have very small petioles . The leaf sheaths are cylindrical , sometimes striped with red , and typically glabrous , but usually have margins that are puberulent or pilose , meaning lined with fine , soft hairs . The leaf blades range from narrowly lanceolate , or lance @-@ shaped , to ovate @-@ elliptic , between egg @-@ shaped and ellipse @-@ shaped . They measure 3 – 12 cm ( 1 1 ⁄ 4 – 4 3 ⁄ 4 in ) by 1 – 4 cm ( 1 ⁄ 2 – 1 1 ⁄ 2 in ) wide . The blades range from glabrous to puberulent and have <unk> , or slightly rough , margins . Their tips are acute , meaning they come to a point quickly , to acuminate , meaning the point develops gradually . The leaf bases are oblique , or uneven . 
 The flowers are arranged on inflorescences called cincinni ( singular : cincinnus ) , which are also called <unk> <unk> . This is a form of a <unk> where the lateral branches arise alternately . The cincinni are subtended by a spathe , a modified leaf . The solitary spathes usually measure 1 @.@ 2 – 3 cm ( 1 ⁄ 2 – 1 1 ⁄ 4 in ) long , but some may be up to 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 1 ⁄ 2 in ) in length , while they are 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 3 cm ( 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 in ) tall , but sometimes up to 1 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 ⁄ 4 in ) . The <unk> spathes typically have a cordate , or heart @-@ shaped , whitish base , which contrasts with its dark green veins . Their margins lack hairs , are somewhat scabrous , or rough , and are unfused , meaning they are distinct to the base . Their apices are acute to acuminate while the surfaces are glabrous , puberulent , or hirsute @-@ ciliate , meaning with longer , shaggier hairs . The spathes are borne on peduncles , or stalks , that measure 0 @.@ 8 – 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 1 ⁄ 2 in ) and sometimes up to 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) long . 
 There are often two cincinni present , though the upper , or distal , cincinnus may be vestigial . The lower , or proximal , cincinnus bears 1 to 4 bisexual flowers and is nearly included in the spathe , while the upper cincinnus has 1 to 2 male flowers and is about 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) long . The individual flowers are subtended by <unk> that fall off early in development . The pedicels supporting single flowers , and later the fruits , are erect initially but curve when in fruit . They measure about 3 – 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 – 0 @.@ 16 in ) . The 3 concave , membranous sepals are inconspicuous , but persist after the fruit develops ; the lateral pair are fused basally , measure only 4 @.@ 5 – 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 18 – 0 @.@ 20 in ) long by 3 – 3 @.@ 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 – 0 @.@ 15 in ) wide , and are elliptic and glabrous . The lower <unk> is lanceolate and about 4 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 18 in ) long by about 2 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 087 in ) wide . The 2 upper petals are blue to indigo in colour , while the much smaller lower petal is white . The upper two petals measure 9 – 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 35 – 0 @.@ 39 in ) long by 8 – 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 – 0 @.@ 39 in ) wide , while the lower petal is 5 – 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 20 – 0 @.@ 24 in ) long by about 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 in ) wide . The 2 upper petals are composed of a claw about 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 in ) long and a broadly ovate limb with an acute apex and a cuneate @-@ cordate base . 
 There are three <unk> fertile stamens , meaning they are on the lower part of the flower , and three <unk> infertile stamens , meaning they are on the upper part of the flower . These infertile stamens are termed staminodes . The fertile stamens are dimorphic : the lateral pair have maroon to indigo anthers that measure about 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 079 in ) long and are elliptic with a base that is <unk> or arrowhead @-@ shaped . Their filaments are about 10 – 12 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 – 0 @.@ 47 in ) long . The central fertile stamen has a yellow , elliptic anther with a maroon connective and a base that is <unk> or spearhead @-@ shaped , but with the lobes at right angles . The anther measures about 2 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 098 in ) long while its filament is about 5 – 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 20 – 0 @.@ 24 in ) long . The three staminodes are all alike with yellow , cruciform , or cross @-@ shaped , antherodes that are about 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 079 in ) long on filaments about 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 in ) long . Sometimes the antherodes will have a central maroon spot . Each <unk> has two abortive lateral pollen sacks . The ovary is ellipsoid , about 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 079 in ) long and has a style that is about 1 @.@ 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 51 in ) long . 
 The fruit is a dehiscent , ellipsoid capsule with two locules each containing two seeds . The capsule is glabrous , brown , measures 4 @.@ 5 – 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 18 – 0 @.@ 31 in ) long , and dehisces into two valves . The seeds are brown or brownish yellow in colour and deltoid , or roughly triangular in outline . They are <unk> , meaning they have distinct upper and lower surfaces , with the ventral , or lower , surface being planar and the dorsal , or upper , surface being convex . Seeds range in length from 2 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 098 – 0 @.@ 165 in ) , but seeds as short as 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 079 in ) can occur , while they are 2 @.@ 2 – 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 087 – 0 @.@ 118 in ) across . The surfaces are rugose pitted @-@ reticulate and are densely covered with smaller farinose granules with sparse larger farinose granules . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Commelina communis was first described in 1753 by Carolus Linnaeus in the first edition of his Species Plantarum , along with eight other species in the genus . The plant serves as the type species for the genus . The scientific name Commelina was chosen based on the Asiatic dayflower . Linnaeus picked the name in honour of the Dutch botanists Jan and Caspar <unk> , using the two large showy petals of Commelina communis to symbolise them . A number of names given to plants thought to be different species have fallen into synonymy with the Asiatic dayflower . Albrecht Wilhelm Roth created the first such synonym , Commelina <unk> , in 1790 . Wenceslas <unk> described what he believed were two new species , Commelina <unk> and Commelina salicifolia , in his work Hortus <unk> , both of which were quickly found to be identical to C. communis . Karl Sigismund Kunth created the synonym Commelina <unk> in 1841 . Finally , Korean populations of the species were named under the synonym Commelina <unk> in 1910 by Augustin Abel Hector Léveillé . 
 Several varieties have also been named . Commelina communis var. ludens was created by C.B. Clarke after demoting it from the full species status in which it was placed by Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel in 1861 . The variety is distinguished by its darker flowers , antherodes with central maroon spots , less well developed distal <unk> that usually do not produce a flower , and spathes that are proportionally broader . Jisaburo <unk> 's Flora of Japan also treats the variety as geographically distinct , stating that it is restricted to mountainous areas . This variety is still accepted by some workers , but others , such Robert B. Faden , consider it impossible to consistently separate from the type variety . Another variety , C. communis var. hortensis , which was named by <unk> Makino and is apparently a cultivated variety which originated from C. communis var. ludens in Japan , is also accepted by some botanists . It differs in having larger showy flowers which are used to produce a dye ( see " Uses " section below ) . A variegated form called C. communis var. ludens f. <unk> named by Frank C. <unk> in 1961 is known to occur randomly throughout much of the species ' range . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The plant 's native distribution includes much of East Asia and Southeast Asia . Country by country , it is found in China , Taiwan , Japan , Korea , the Russian Far East , Cambodia , Laos , Malaysia , Thailand and Vietnam . Within China it is found in all provinces except Qinghai , Hainan , Xinjiang , and Tibet . In Japan the plant is found throughout the bulk of the country from Hokkaido south to Kyūshū . In Russia the Asiatic dayflower is found naturally on Sakhalin as well as in the Far East in areas surrounding the Ussuri River . 
 The species has been introduced to much of Europe and eastern North America . On the former continent it is now found from Central Europe well into western Russia . Specifically it is known from Italy north to Switzerland , east through the region encompassing the former Yugoslavia , east into the regions around the Black Sea including Romania , the Moldavia Region , and the Ukraine but excluding Crimea , north through the Dnieper Basin into Belarus and Russia , continuing east into the regions surrounding the Don River and the Volga River south to their intersection at the Volga @-@ Don Canal and north to the regions around Lake Ladoga and Lake Ilmen , and farther east to the regions of the Ural River and the Kama River . It is also found in the Czech Republic and Slovakia . It is present in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in Canada , and in most of the eastern and central American states from Massachusetts and New York in the northeast , west to Minnesota and south through the Great Plains to Texas and east to extreme northern Florida in the United States . 
 Within its native distribution , the plant is most typical of moist , open places , including shady forest edges and wet areas of crop fields , orchards , ditches , and roadsides . In Taiwan , it can be found from 350 to 2 @,@ 400 m ( 1 @,@ 150 to 7 @,@ 870 ft ) elevation . In areas where the Asiatic dayflower is an introduced weed it is most common in waste places , but also along the edges of fields , woods , and marshes , and occasionally penetrating into woods . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 The Asiatic dayflower is considered an invasive weed in many areas where it has been introduced . In the United States , the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation , for example , categorises the species as " occasionally invasive " in its Invasive Plant Species of Virginia . This means that the plant will " not affect ecosystem processes , but may alter plant community composition by outcompeting one or more native plant species " . The species is typically limited to disturbed sites , whence it spreads relatively slowly . Within its native range in China it is also sometimes considered a pest , especially in the northeast of the country where it has caused economically significant agricultural damage in orchards . 
 The Asiatic dayflower has been used in pollination studies concerning the behaviour of plants in relation to their pollinators . One important experiment tested the hypotheses that floral guides ( i.e. various patterns and colours on anthers and petals ) simultaneously promote pollinator visitation and prevent visits where the pollinator fails to come into contact with the stigma or anthers , termed pollen theft . As the flowers of the Asiatic dayflower lack nectar , they offer only pollen as a reward to their visitors . To attract pollinators , the plant has three types of brightly colored floral organs : the large blue petals , fertile yellow anthers , and infertile yellow antherodes that lack pollen . When the infertile antherodes were experimentally removed in natural populations , the number of total floral visitor landings was reduced , supporting the hypothesis that these infertile anthers essentially trick their pollinators into believing they offer more than they actually do . When the central , bright yellow fertile anther was removed , leaving only two brown fertile anthers , the frequency of legitimate flower landings decreased , meaning that the visitors were not pollinating the flowers , suggesting that floral signals also prevent " theft " , or visits where the pollinators take pollen , but do not place any on the stigma . Thus both the fertile anthers and the infertile antherodes were shown to play an important role in both increasing visitor landings and orienting floral visitors toward a landing point appropriate for pollination . 
 Recent studies have shown that wild Asiatic dayflower populations found growing on copper mine spoils in eastern China exhibited very high concentrations of copper within the plants , more so than the 48 species tested . Commelina communis had sequestered some 361 mg / kg of copper , while the plant with the next highest concentration , Polygonum <unk> , had 286 mg / kg . Five of the species examined , including the Asiatic dayflower , also showed high concentrations of other metals such as zinc , lead , and cadmium . The results suggest that the Asiatic dayflower is a good candidate for copper mine spoil revegetation and phytoremediation . 
 Ten species of fungi have been found on the Asiatic dayflower , four of which can infect the plant , while 12 species of insects are known to be associated with it . Two of the fungi , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , are thought to be host specific with the Asiatic dayflower . Of the ten fungi seven are Basidiomycota and three are Ascomycota . Nine of the 12 insects associated with the plant are beetles , seven of which are in the genus Lema , while the other two are in the families <unk> and Pentatomidae . The remaining three insects include one species of moth , <unk> <unk> , and two true bugs , namely Aphis <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Important pollinators include the Asian honeybee , Apis <unk> , <unk> fly , <unk> <unk> , and the bumble bee species Bombus <unk> .

 = = = Medicine and food = = = 
 In China it is used as a medicinal herb with <unk> , antipyretic , anti @-@ inflammatory , and diuretic effects . Additionally , it is also used for treating sore throats and tonsillitis . Recent pharmacological investigations have revealed that the Asiatic dayflower contains at least five active compounds . One of these , p @-@ <unk> acid , shows antibacterial activity , while another , D @-@ mannitol , has an <unk> effect . In China and India the plant is also used as a vegetable and fodder crop . 
 = = = Pigment and dye = = = 
 In Japan there is a sizeable dye industry devoted to the plant . The purported variety Commelina communis var. hortensis , which is apparently a cultivated form of another putative variety , namely Commelina communis var. ludens , is grown for its larger petals which yield a blue juice used in manufacturing a paper called <unk> or aigami ( <unk> ) , which is the famous product of the Yamada village in the Shiga prefecture . The paper is usually <unk> , allowing the pigment to be reabsorbed in water for use as a dye . The dye , also referred to as aigami , but also as <unk> ( <unk> ) or <unk> ( <unk> ) , is composed primarily of malonyl <unk> and was used extensively as a colorant in 18th and 19th century woodblock prints in Japan , especially during the early Ukiyo @-@ e era . The colorant is known to have been used by several famous Ukiyo @-@ e artists such as Torii Kiyonaga . However , aigami fades to a greenish yellow in a matter of months when exposed to sunlight . As a result , the color was eventually replaced by imported Prussian blue , a much more stable colour with its first commercial appearance in 1829 in the work of <unk> Eisen . The plant is also grown for its dye in northern China . Additional uses of the colourant include making preparatory designs on cloth before dyeing with other pigments . 
 <unk> is the blue pigment from the flowers of C. communis , is a <unk> . It is a complex of 4 Mg2 + ions chelating six anthocyanin molecules . 
 = = = Plant physiology and development = = = 
 Commelina communis is also used as a model organism in plant physiology and plant development to a limited extent , especially in relation to stomatal physiology and the biology of pigmentation development . For example , the blue pigmentation of Asiatic dayflower petals was shown to consist of a large complex of six anthocyanins , six flavones , and two associated <unk> ions , demonstrating that supramolecular complexes of several <unk> and <unk> metals often determine colour . Other research on the plant has helped to explain photoreceptor systems in plants such as their stomatal responses to blue light versus red light spectrums , <unk> acid perception and its role in cell signaling , particularly concerning the chemical 's role in stomatal function , the role of <unk> in inhibiting stomatal opening , and the necessity of calcium in stomatal closure , among other topics . Its widespread use in stomatal studies is due to the fact that the leaves produce exceptional epidermal peels that are consistently one cell layer thick . This same quality makes the plant popular for use in laboratory exercises in higher education for demonstrating stomatal function and morphology . Guard cell turgor pressure and its regulation in the opening and closing of stomata is particularly easy to demonstrate with the Asiatic dayflower .

 Outlaw Star ( 星方武侠アウトロースター , Seihō Bukyō <unk> Sutā , lit . " Outlaw Star : Starward Warrior Knight " ) is a seinen manga series written and illustrated by Takehiko Itō and his affiliated Morning Star Studio . The series takes place in the " Toward Stars Era " universe in which spacecraft are capable of traveling faster than the speed of light . The plot follows protagonist Gene Starwind and his motley crew of an inherited ship dubbed the " Outlaw Star " , as they search for a legendary , outer space treasure trove called the " Galactic Leyline " . 
 Outlaw Star was originally serialized in the monthly Shueisha magazine Ultra Jump between 1996 and 1999 for a total of 21 chapters . Three volumes of collected chapters were published in Japan between August 1997 and January 1999 . Although no official English version of the manga exists , it has been published in Chinese , German , Italian , and Spanish . Sunrise Studios produced a 26 @-@ episode anime adaptation that was directed by Mitsuru Hongo and aired on the Japanese station TV Tokyo in early 1998 . The animated series has since been translated and broadcast worldwide . This includes an English version from Bandai Entertainment that received an edited airing on the North American Cartoon Network blocks Toonami in early 2001 and later on Adult Swim in early 2002 . Outlaw Star has been licensed for release in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment and in Europe by Beez Entertainment . A few Japanese @-@ exclusive audio CDs and light novels have been spawned since the start of the manga 's publication . 
 Critical reception for Outlaw Star has been mostly positive . Many reviewers praised the anime series , particularly its animation style and its balance of dramatic and comedic elements . However , some found fault with the show 's pacing , believing that the storyline quality begins to wane after the first few episodes . Sunrise produced a spin @-@ off television series titled Angel Links ( <unk> , Seihō Tenshi Enjeru <unk> , lit . " Angel Links : Starward Angels " ) , which aired in Japan in 1999 . Preliminary plans were made to create a direct sequel in the form of a single @-@ episode ( OVA ) called " Sword of Wind , " but production never began . Nevertheless , staff have expressed their hopes of there one day being a sequel on television , with certain plot developments in the final episode , such as the survival of Gene 's longtime enemy Ron MacDougall , the crew heading off into space to a new adventure , and Gene and his friend Melfina becoming lovers , leaving the door open to a continuation to the anime . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Outlaw Star is a space opera / Space Western set in the fictional " Towards Stars Era " ( <unk> , <unk> ) universe . During its past , an asteroid containing a material known as " <unk> " crashed in the fictional <unk> desert of northern China . Scientists found that the <unk> contained properties related to " ether " , an energy source that would allow spacecraft to travel faster than the speed of light , and thus traverse large distances of the universe in a short time . As new colonies were formed throughout the vast reaches of outer space , pirates , assassins , and outlaws began to threaten humanity 's new frontier . To create order , the Earth Federation established four empires : USSA , Einhorn , Piotr , and <unk> . However , internal power struggles within the factions and conflicts amongst one another become abundant , leading to inevitable lawlessness . The storyline starts shortly after an infamous outlaw named " Hot Ice " Hilda flees from the Kei Pirates , a branch of the Tin <unk> . Hilda has stolen from them a highly @-@ advanced prototype ship dubbed the <unk> @-@ II and a suitcase containing a bio @-@ android called Melfina , the only being capable of interfacing with the ship . 
 Outlaw Star opens on the backwater planet Sentinel III , on which the protagonist Gene Starwind and his 11 @-@ year @-@ old business associate James " Jim " Hawking run a small jack @-@ of @-@ all @-@ trades business . After the two take a job as bodyguards for a disguised Hilda and engage in a brief skirmish with the Kei Pirates , Gene and Jim find themselves the owners of the <unk> @-@ II ( which they nickname the " Outlaw Star " ) and the caretakers of Melfina . Hilda reveals that the ship 's true purpose is to locate the " Galactic Leyline " ( <unk> , Ginga no Ryū <unk> , lit . " Galactic Dragon Vein " ) , a place which popular claims say is a holder of immense treasure , knowledge , and power . Throughout the course of the series , the crew grows to include the kimono @-@ garbed contract killer " Twilight " Suzuka and the <unk> @-@ <unk> alien <unk> Aisha <unk> . 
 The Outlaw Star manga series and animated television series are paced differently than one another . The anime episodes often involve Gene and his comrades taking on various jobs or missions to fund their ship 's massive maintenance costs . Throughout their travels , the crew often encounters Ronald MacDougall and Harry MacDougall , a pair of bounty hunters responsible for the death of Gene 's father . Ronald acts as a rival to Gene , while Harry wishes to form a bond with Melfina , a bio @-@ android like himself , who instead develops strong feelings for Gene . The crew also contends with others that learn of the Outlaw Star 's connection to the Galactic Leyline . They are Nguyen Khan , a scientist wishing to gain omniscience through the Leyline ; and Lord Hazanko , the leader of the ruthless assassin organization the <unk> Seven that seek the Leyline to gain ultimate power . The series climaxes when all parties meet on the physical plane of the Leyline . In the end , Ron MacDougall retreats , saved by a computer copy of his brother Harry ( who is killed trying to protect Melfina from Hazanko ) , Khan is integrated into the Leyline as data , Gene reveals to Melfina that he is in love with her and frees her from the Leyline by making it their shared wish to be together forever , and Hazanko is eventually defeated by the Outlaw Star crewmembers . Once the conflict comes to a close , Gene and his friends return to Sentinel III and go their separate ways , but ultimately reunite to continue their adventures together . 
 = = Production = = 
 Outlaw Star was created by Morning Star Studio . Takehiko Itō was the manga 's director , writer , and chief artist . Itō was aided in his duties by Hajime Yatate , a pseudonym of writers at Sunrise . Others who contributed to the work include producer <unk> Tomita ; starship designer Shoji Kawamori ; character concept and imageboard illustrators Yutaka <unk> and Hajime <unk> ; and a team of production designers and assistant artists . Outlaw Star takes place in the Toward Stars Era , the same universe as Itō 's <unk> <unk> Monogatari ( <unk> , lit . " Future @-@ Retro Hero Story " ) , a pulp @-@ science fiction manga that was first serialized by Kadokawa Shoten in 1988 . Itō has described this earlier work as " something out of boy 's dream " and took a much more mature , scientific approach when writing Outlaw Star . The author also referenced aspects of Chinese culture when creating Outlaw Star . 
 The animated television series of Outlaw Star was produced by Sunrise and directed by Mitsuru Hongo , whose previous credits include the comedy Crayon Shin @-@ chan and the magical girl series Shamanic Princess . The script was chiefly written by Katsuhiko Chiba , who wrote about three @-@ quarters of the episodes . Character designs were handled by Hiroyuki <unk> ( Detonator <unk> , Armored Trooper <unk> ) and Takuya Saito . The show 's vehicles were designed by <unk> Ishigaki and Macross and Gundam mecha artist Shōji Kawamori , the latter of whom designed the Outlaw Star ship itself . Koh Otani composed the musical score for the Outlaw Star anime . The series features the opening theme " Through the Night " written and performed Masahiko <unk> , and two closing themes , " Hiru no Tsuki " ( <unk> , lit . " Daytime Moon " ) and " Tsuki no Ie " ( <unk> , lit . " House of the Moon " ) , both written and performed by Akino Arai . " Through the Night " was chosen for the opening among several candidate songs . Itō and Sunrise agreed that the theme should be one that had not been used in a recent animation and that it should feature male vocals . <unk> wrote the song to resemble a story , took into account its longterm impact , and felt it fit Outlaw Star perfectly .

 The 26 @-@ episode anime adaptation of Outlaw Star began broadcasting in Japan on TV Tokyo from January 8 , 1998 and ended on June 25 , 1998 , though the broadcast began on January 9 , as it was in a 1 : 15 A.M. time slot . The series was licensed by Bandai Entertainment The English version was produced by <unk> Limit Productions and was aired on the evening Toonami block beginning on January 15 , 2001 . This broadcast of the show was heavily edited due to its adult content . Profanity was removed , scenes with violence and lewd behavior were cut or toned down , and many scenes containing nudity were altered by digitally inserting clothing onto characters . Episode 23 , in which the Outlaw Star crew visits a hot spring planet , was not aired due to nudity and suggestive themes . However , some instances of adult language were not removed for the anime 's initial run . Sean Akins , Toonami 's creative director , claimed that Cartoon Network made all of their own edits to their licensed properties during this time period , which they did " in a way that preserves the story " . The role of Fred Luo , a recurring homosexual character , was considerably toned down . Cartoon Network had no specific editing policy with regard to gay characters , but that " overt sexuality or implied sexuality of any kind are not allowed " . Outlaw Star was also aired on the late night Adult Swim block throughout 2002 . However , the broadcast was cancelled late in the year and , according to Akins , the network allowed its rights to the anime to expire by 2003 . Outlaw Star was aired in the United Kingdom on CNX in October 2002 . 
 Bandai released the first 13 episodes of Outlaw Star on DVD in Japan on August 25 , 1999 , and the remaining 13 episodes on November 25 , 1999 . A Japanese " remastered " DVD boxset containing the entire series was published by Bandai on September 22 , 2006 . Yet another DVD boxset , Emotion the Best : Seihō Bukyō Outlaw Star , was released in Japan on September 24 , 2010 . Bandai released the series in North America in three DVD collections on September 1 , 2000 , February 14 , 2001 , and March 6 , 2001 .

 A hardcover guidebook titled <unk> no Kioku – Seihō Bukyō Outlaw Star ( <unk> ― 星方武侠アウトロースター , lit . " Outlaw Record – Starward Warrior Knight Outlaw Star " ) was published by Fujimi Shobo as part of its Dragon Magazine imprint in November 1998 . The guide contains summaries of the manga and anime , character profiles , sketches , animation cels , and interviews with the production staff . In 2001 , Bandai released an Outlaw Star action figure set as part of a line based on its licensed anime franchises . The set contains the Outlaw Star ship and the characters Gene and Melfina . Asako Nishida , one of the show 's animation directors , compiled her contributions to the Toward Stars Era franchise in a 2009 art book .

 Critical reception for Outlaw Star has been favorable . Eric Luce , <unk> Upatkoon , and Michael Poirier of EX.org all gave similarly positive reviews for the Japanese manga , Japanese anime , and English anime versions of Outlaw Star respectively . Luce was complimentary of the manga 's " raw " yet " good and distinctive " artwork , detailed backgrounds , and good placement of characters among one another . However , he was annoyed that all the women have " disturbing tendency to all have the same silicone stiffened chests " and that characters typically wear mad grins . Upatkoon found the artwork of the anime version to be good , and he particularly enjoyed the opening sequence , but took issue with the occasionally inconsistent character designs . He also appreciated the show 's dichotomy between serious and humorous subject matter , shown by the titular ship in its <unk> mode and how it communicates with the crew . Poirier found the main protagonist Gene to be the anime 's best characterization : " Gene Starwind is a sly , sharp @-@ shooting hero whose success with his gun ( and with the ladies ) is matched only by his propensity to get space @-@ sick . Imagine that : the star of a space @-@ faring series has to continually worry about vomiting onto his control panel . This sort of ironic comedy can be found throughout Outlaw Star , creating excellent segues between the fantastic action sequences and the delightful characters . " Poirier was intrigued by its other characters as well , and was impressed by the " sharp but fluid " animation style and the spaceship designs . Mania.com 's David Owens appreciated the artistic style specifically for the characters , nearly all of which he incidentally found likeable . Jacob <unk> of THEM Anime Reviews additionally noted high animation quality throughout . Although he proclaimed the vehicle designs of Outlaw Star to be superb , <unk> Addicts writer Martin Ouellette judged the animation and character designs to be " less lucky " and lacking in " the special aura " of Sunrise 's acclaimed 1998 series Cowboy Bebop . Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy , authors of the The Anime Encyclopedia agreeably denoted Outlaw Star as " no competition for Cowboy Bebop in terms of style , content , or execution " . 
 Critical reception for the plot of Outlaw Star has been mixed . <unk> found that though the series features many clichés of 1990 's science fiction anime , Outlaw Star manages to transcend them as well . " Maybe it doesn 't go anywhere that other series haven 't already been , " the reviewer stated . " But boy , does it have a damn good time getting there . " Upatkoon observed that the plot " [ takes ] off with a bang at the beginning " and then begins to drag . Keith Dawe of Animerica also noted this about the anime 's pacing , stating that even as the first few episodes do well to begin the narrative , the show 's writers rely too heavily on inertia to advance it . He went on to remark that the series suffers from " unfocused scripting " and that " one has to endure the occasional cheesy episode to reap the rewards of a show that is clever , pragmatic and amusing " . However , Dawe did regard the English script writing and voice acting , and called the over @-@ the @-@ top introductory narration for each episode a reminder that the show should be enjoyed for what it was . Owens commented that the plot will not seem very original , but that it does seem to have direction , despite said direction not being very clear . 
 Outlaw Star has received very modest commercial success and miscellaneous viewer recognition . The initial shipment of the manga 's first volume sold out nationwide in Japan . According to Morning Star Studio 's English website , the Outlaw Star manga has sold 250 @,@ 000 copies , though the anime series was less successful . The Outlaw Star television series was aired in Japan during a late night timeslot because it was not likely to obtain more than one or two percent viewership like prime time shows . Outlaw Star was voted as the 20th best anime of 1999 in the Japanese Animage Anime Grand Prix . During a summer 2001 online poll to determine which show would return to Toonami , Outlaw Star received approximately two @-@ thirds of the more than 150 @,@ 000 votes cast . In August 2002 , Cartoon Network announced that the late @-@ night Adult Swim Outlaw Star received a Nielsen rating of 0 @.@ 9 , up 125 percent for that same time slot and a delivery of 414 @,@ 000 , up 135 percent for the 18 – 34 age range . The Outlaw Star Complete Collection was the 21st best @-@ selling anime DVD in the United States in 2006 and the 25th in 2007 . In 2012 , Bandai 's North American division , Bandai Entertainment , listed Outlaw Star as one of its top five most successful anime properties . Josh Pool of IGN listed Outlaw Star at number six on its " Top Ten Anime Themes and Soundtracks of All @-@ Time " , noting a stark polarity between the opening and ending themes .

 In 1999 , Sunrise Studios produced a spin @-@ off television series titled Angel Links ( <unk> , Seihō Tenshi Enjeru <unk> , lit . " Angels of the Stars : Angel Links " ) . Outlaw Star and Angel Links take place in the same universe ; characters from both series appeared in an episode of Outlaw Star , but the two have little else in relation . Morning Star Studio also drafted a proposed sequel to Outlaw Star in the form of a single @-@ episode OVA special titled Outlaw Star 2 : Sword of Wind on its official website with character designs and a plot outline . Set three years after the events of Outlaw Star , it was to continue the adventures of Gene Starwind in his new starship named " Sword of Wind " . Due to the lack of the franchise 's popularity in Japan and the busy schedule of animation director Mitsuru Hongo , no production date was set . In October 2001 , Takehiko Itō commented that his team only had static , preliminary plans for the sequel series and that they could perhaps continue the manga series in the future . Staff have also expressed their hopes of there being a sequel on television to the original anime series . 
 = Isopogon anethifolius = 
 Isopogon anethifolius , commonly known as <unk> or narrow @-@ leafed drumsticks , is a shrub in the family Proteaceae . The species is found only in coastal areas near Sydney , Australia , and to the immediate west . It occurs naturally in woodland , open forest and heathland on sandstone soils . An upright shrub , it can reach to 3 m ( 10 ft ) in height , with terete leaves that are divided and narrow . The yellow flowers appear from September to December and are prominently displayed . They are followed by round grey cones , which give the plant its common name of drumsticks . The small hairy seeds are found in the old flower parts . 
 Isopogon anethifolius regenerates after bushfire by resprouting from its woody base , known as a lignotuber , as well as from seed . It was described by Richard Salisbury in 1796 , and was first grown in the United Kingdom the same year . One of the easiest members of the genus Isopogon to grow in cultivation , I. anethifolius grows readily in the garden if located in a sunny or part @-@ shaded spot with sandy soil and good drainage . 
 = = Description = = 
 Isopogon anethifolius is a shrub usually between 1 and 3 m ( 3 and 10 ft ) high with an upright habit ( tall and thin with mostly vertical stems ) . It generally grows taller in more sheltered areas such as woodlands , and shorter in more exposed areas . The stems are reddish in colour , and new growth in winter is tinged with reddish and tan tones . The leaves are terete ( round in cross section ) and less than 1 mm ( 1 ⁄ 25 in ) in diameter . They branch once or twice in their 16 cm ( 6 1 ⁄ 4 in ) length . The globular yellow flowerheads , known as inflorescences , appear at the ends of branches in spring and early summer ( September to December ) , though occasionally at other times of year . These are up to 4 cm ( 1 1 ⁄ 2 in ) in diameter . The individual flowers arise out of the central woody globe in a spiral pattern , and are around 1 @.@ 2 cm ( 1 ⁄ 2 in ) long . They are straight stalkless structures that originate from a scale on the globe , composed of a tubular structure known as the perianth , which envelopes the flower 's sexual organs . The perianth splits into four segments , revealing a thin delicate style that is tipped with the stigma . At the ends of the four perianth segments are the male pollen @-@ bearing structures known as anthers . Arranged in a spiral pattern , the flowers open from the outer / bottom of the flowerhead inwards . The egg @-@ shaped grey cones are revealed as the old flower parts fall away , and are up to 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 in ) in diameter . The seed @-@ bearing nuts are small — up to 4 mm ( 3 ⁄ 16 in ) across — and lined with hairs . The seed weighs around 4 mg ( 0 @.@ <unk> oz ) . 
 The terete leaves readily distinguish Isopogon anethifolius from other members of the genus , which have flat leaves and are greater than 1 mm ( 1 ⁄ 25 in ) across . On a microscopic level , the supporting ground tissue of I. anethifolius differs from some of its genus by its irregular misshapen <unk> ( thick @-@ walled cells that make up part of the ground tissue ) and contorted cell body . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Isopogon anethifolius was among the plants collected by English botanist Joseph Banks and Swedish naturalist Daniel Solander on 5 May 1770 at Botany Bay during the first voyage of Captain James Cook . A drawing by Scottish artist Sydney Parkinson was the source for a subsequent painting by James Britten , published in 1905 . 
 English botanist Richard Salisbury described this species in 1796 as Protea <unk> , from a specimen collected in Port Jackson ( Sydney ) . The species name is derived from the Latin words <unk> " dill " and folium " leaf " , from the resemblance of its leaves to those of the herb . The common name is variously written as <unk> , narrow @-@ leaf- , or narrow @-@ leafed drumsticks . The common name drumsticks is derived from the globular cones of the members of the genus . 
 In 1799 , the Spanish botanist Antonio José Cavanilles described Protea <unk> , later identified as a synonym by Salisbury and Robert Brown . I. anethifolius gained its current name in 1809 when it was redescribed as the dill @-@ leaved <unk> ( Isopogon anethifolius ) by English plantsman Joseph Knight in his controversial work On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae . Robert Brown had written of the genus Isopogon but Knight had hurried out his work before Brown 's . Brown 's description appeared in his paper On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae in the Transactions of the Linnean Society in 1810 . 
 French naturalist Michel Gandoger described four taxa in 1919 that he regarded as similar to ( but distinct from ) I. anethifolius . I. <unk> was a plant from Rylstone on the Central Tablelands , which he distinguished by its crowded leaves that were 7 – 8 cm ( 2 3 ⁄ 4 – 3 1 ⁄ 4 in ) long . I. <unk> was a plant with more scattered leaves that were 12 – 14 cm ( 4 3 ⁄ 4 – 5 1 ⁄ 2 in ) long . He described I. <unk> from the Port Jackson district on the basis of round ( rather than oval ) infructescences ( cones ) , and I. <unk> from Western Australia . All four were subsequently synonymised with I. anethifolius . Gandoger described 212 taxa of Australian plants , almost all of which turned out to be species already described . 
 The 1891 publication Revisio generum plantarum was German botanist Otto Kuntze 's response to what he perceived as poor method in existing nomenclatural practice . Because Isopogon was based on Isopogon anemonifolius , and that species had already been placed by Salisbury in the segregate genus Atylus in 1807 , Kuntze revived the latter genus on the grounds of priority , and made the new combination Atylus anethifolius . However , Kuntze 's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists . Ultimately , the genus Isopogon was nomenclaturally conserved over Atylus by the International Botanical Congress of 1905 . 
 Like all species in the Isopogon genus , I. anethifolius has 13 haploid chromosomes . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Isopogon anethifolius is found only in New South Wales , where it occurs in the Sydney Basin and surrounds , from Braidwood northwards to Mount <unk> in Wollemi National Park . The annual rainfall in these areas ranges from 900 to 1600 mm ( 35 – 60 in ) . The species occurs naturally from sea level to 1200 m ( 4000 ft ) altitude and is found on sandstone in heathland and dry sclerophyll woodland . Typical trees it is associated with include the scribbly gums Eucalyptus haemastoma and E. sclerophylla and silvertop ash ( E. sieberi ) , open forest plants such as soft geebung ( Persoonia mollis ) , and heathland plants such as heath banksia ( Banksia ericifolia ) , dwarf she @-@ oak ( Allocasuarina nana ) and Wingello grevillea ( Grevillea molyneuxii ) . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Isopogon anethifolius resprouts from its woody base , known as a lignotuber , after bushfire . It is also serotinous — the seeds are held on the plant as a canopy @-@ based seedbank and are released after fire . These then fall directly to the ground or are blown a short distance by wind . Plants resprouting from the lignotuber can flower in around two and a half years , while seedlings take around three and a half years . 
 Leaf spotting is caused by the fungus <unk> . Flower buds may be damaged by weevils . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 Isopogon anethifolius was first cultivated in the United Kingdom in 1796 . Along with Isopogon <unk> , it is the easiest member of the genus to grow . The fine foliage , red stems , bright yellow flowers in spring and distinctive drumsticks afterwards make I. anethifolius an appealing garden plant . It has potential as a screening plant ( its dense foliage can be used for privacy ) . It prefers acidic soil with extra water , though it does not tolerate waterlogging . A part @-@ shaded position is the preferred location , though I. anethifolius grows readily in full sun . Plants can withstand frosts to − 8 ° C ( 20 ° F ) . Fertiliser applied in spring assists growth . Young plants can grow long stems that eventually droop , and respond well to pruning . The species can be propagated by cuttings or seeds , which germinate after 30 to 60 days . Flowering can take several years from seed . Western Australian Isopogon species including I. cuneatus and I. <unk> have been grafted onto rootstocks of this species . The flowers , cones and foliage are used in the cut @-@ flower industry . 
 = 1996 Orange Bowl ( December ) = 
 The 63rd Orange Bowl , also known as the 1996 Orange Bowl , was a 1996 – 1997 Bowl Alliance game played on December 31 , 1996 between the Nebraska Cornhuskers and the Virginia Tech Hokies . Virginia Tech , champions of the Big East Conference , came into the game with a 10 – 1 record and # 10 AP ranking , whereas Nebraska , members of the Big 12 Conference , came into the game with a 10 – 2 and No. 6 ranking . In a high @-@ scoring affair , Nebraska defeated Virginia Tech , 41 – 21 . 
 Due to Bowl Alliance ( predecessor to the Bowl Championship Series ) rules , the Orange Bowl following the 1996 season was played on December 31 , instead of January 1 or later . This marked the first time that an Orange Bowl was played prior to New Year 's Day : there were two Orange Bowls in the same calendar year — one in January , following the 1995 season , and the other in December , following the 1996 season . The Orange Bowl Committee , which had the fourth and sixth selections of eligible Bowl Alliance teams , selected Big East champions Virginia Tech and Nebraska , an at @-@ large selection that appeared to be a national championship game contender before its loss to Texas in the inaugural Big 12 Championship Game . 
 The weeks before the game were filled with controversy , as both teams had multiple players arrested or charged with crimes . Despite having lost their last game before the Orange Bowl , Nebraska was heavily favored over Virginia Tech , as spread bettors favored the Cornhuskers by 16 or 17 points , depending on the source used . The Cornhuskers had won the 1994 and 1995 national championships , and presented an imposing history when compared with that of Virginia Tech , which had posted its most important win in school history at the end of the previous season , defeating Texas in the 1995 Sugar Bowl . 
 On December 31 , the weather was clear and warm at the start of the game , though a light rain began to fall in the fourth quarter . Virginia Tech scored first , taking a 7 – 0 lead at the end of the first quarter — its only advantage in the game . In the second quarter , Nebraska scored three times for 17 points , taking a 17 – 7 lead before Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller threw a touchdown pass with 19 seconds remaining in the first half , cutting Nebraska 's lead to 17 – 14 . In the third quarter , the two teams alternated scores , with Nebraska maintaining a three or 10 @-@ point lead throughout . At the end of the third quarter , Nebraska had a 31 – 21 lead . In the final quarter of the game , Nebraska scored 10 unanswered points as the Cornhuskers used their large number of backup players to advantage . The final score was 41 – 21 , Nebraska . 
 = = Team selection = = 
 During the 1996 season , the Orange Bowl was a member of the Bowl Alliance , a precursor to the modern Bowl Championship Series . The Bowl Alliance was formed prior to the 1995 college football season in an effort to match the No. 1 and No. 2 teams at the conclusion of the regular season while also ensuring other high @-@ ranking teams were allowed to participate in high @-@ profile bowl games . The Alliance included the Southeastern Conference , Big 12 Conference , Atlantic Coast Conference , and Big East Conference . As agreed , the champions of each conference would play in one of three Bowl Alliance games : the Orange Bowl , Sugar Bowl , and Fiesta Bowl . The Big Ten and Pac @-@ 10 conferences , which had a separate agreement with the Rose Bowl , were not included in the Bowl Alliance until 1998 , when the Alliance became the Bowl Championship Series . 
 In 1996 , the Orange Bowl had the fourth and sixth selections from eligible Bowl Alliance teams . The Sugar Bowl had the top two picks , while the Fiesta Bowl , which had the top picks in 1995 , received the third and fifth picks . Due to Bowl Alliance restrictions , the Orange Bowl at the end of the 1996 season had to be played on December 31 , marking the first time in the history of the Orange Bowl that the game was not played in January and that there were two Orange Bowls in the same year — one at the end of the 1995 season , and the other at the conclusion of the 1996 season . The only other time was in 2014 , the first year of the college football playoffs . 
 = = = Nebraska = = = 
 The Nebraska Cornhuskers began the 1996 season having won the national championship in both 1994 and 1995 . Though Nebraska was now a member of a new conference — the former Big Eight Conference had been merged with four Texas schools to become the Big 12 — it was widely expected that Nebraska would repeat the performance for a third time in 1996 . 
 Nebraska was ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press preseason poll , and lived up to the ranking in its first game of the season . On September 7 , Nebraska overwhelmed the Michigan State Spartans , 55 – 14 . After an off week , however , Nebraska fans were shocked by one of the first big national upsets of the season as Nebraska was shut out by No. 17 Arizona State , 19 – 0 . The loss dropped Nebraska to No. 8 in the rankings , but as the season wore on , Nebraska rose through the ranks as the Cornhuskers won seven consecutive games . Nebraska 's 10 – 1 record to that point earned it a trip to the first @-@ ever Big 12 Championship Game in St. Louis , Missouri , against the Texas Longhorns . 
 Despite Nebraska 's early @-@ season loss , the Cornhuskers still had a chance to win a record @-@ setting third consecutive national championship . A win against Texas would earn Nebraska a bid to the Sugar Bowl and a game against No. 1 Florida State to decide the national championship . Unfortunately for Nebraska , the underdog Longhorns upset heavily favored Nebraska , 37 – 27 . Eight days after losing to Texas , Nebraska was awarded a bid to the Orange Bowl . 
 = = = Virginia Tech = = = 
 The Virginia Tech Hokies entered the 1996 season having ended 1995 with a victory over No. 9 Texas in the 1995 Sugar Bowl ( December ) , considered to be the most important game in Virginia Tech history to that point . Following the victory , hopes were high that the Hokies would repeat the performance in the 1996 season . 
 Virginia Tech kicked off the 1996 season in Akron , Ohio , against the Akron Zips . The Hokies were nearly upset by the Zips , but eventually won the game , 21 – 18 . Tech dropped in rank due to the close finish , and traveled next to Boston , Massachusetts to play the Boston College Eagles . In a nationally televised game , Tech defeated the Eagles , 45 – 7 . The Hokies followed that win with a home @-@ opening victory against Rutgers , then traveled to Syracuse , New York , to play the Syracuse Orangemen . Though the Hokies lost , 21 – 52 , they recovered to win their final seven games of the regular season , securing a Big East championship and a trip to the Orange Bowl .

 Nebraska was heavily favored to win the contest , as the point spread favored Nebraska by 16 points to 17 points . Heading into the Orange Bowl , the two teams presented a study in contrasts . The Cornhuskers boasted a string of 28 seasons with nine or more victories , received 28 straight bowl bids , spent 256 consecutive weeks ranked in the AP poll , and had recorded 214 straight sellouts in their 75 @,@ 000 @-@ capacity home stadium . Virginia Tech , meanwhile , had a bowl streak dating back just three years , to the 1993 Independence Bowl , and while the game was Nebraska 's 16th Orange Bowl , it was Virginia Tech 's first . Nebraska and Virginia Tech were among the winningest seven teams in Division I @-@ A college football during the two seasons prior to the Orange Bowl . Virginia Tech had 20 wins in those two seasons , while Nebraska had 22 victories . 
 In the first weeks after the matchup was announced , Virginia Tech sold its allotment of 15 @,@ 000 tickets , while Nebraska sales lagged , only reaching the 5 @,@ 000 mark in the time it took Tech to sell its allotment . The slow Nebraska sales were largely due to fans who had booked trips to the Sugar Bowl in anticipation of a victory by the Cornhuskers in the Big 12 championship game . Disappointed by the loss , many people elected not to make the trip to Miami . By December 27 , four days prior to the game , Tech had increased its total to 15 @,@ 500 , while Nebraska improved to 8 @,@ 000 sold . The game was the first Orange Bowl to be played at Miami 's professional football arena , Pro Player Stadium , instead of Orange Bowl stadium . The move was made in order to secure the Orange Bowl 's place in the Bowl Alliance , as Pro Player Stadium was a more modern facility with a larger seating capacity .

 In the months , weeks and days prior to the Orange Bowl , the Virginia Tech and Nebraska football teams were affected by multiple criminal incidents . In the 15 months immediately prior to the Orange Bowl , Virginia Tech players accumulated 22 arrests , six convictions , and four charges dropped . The most notable of these arrests came on December 16 , slightly more than two weeks prior to the Orange Bowl , when Brian Edmonds , the Hokies ' starting fullback , and James Crawford , a backup wide receiver , were arrested on charges of rape and attempted sodomy . The two players were immediately suspended from the football team . The day before the Orange Bowl , Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer announced further suspensions , indicating that backup defensive tackle Nat Williams , backup linebacker Tyron Edmond , and backup receiver Angelo Harrison would not participate in the Orange Bowl .

 At the conclusion of the 1996 regular season , the Nebraska Cornhuskers boasted the No. 4 rushing offense in Division I @-@ A college football , averaging 292 rushing yards per game and 422 overall yards per game . Despite those figures , the Cornhuskers ' two leading rushers were hampered by injury and their participation was in doubt . Ahman Green , who led the Nebraska offense with 155 carries , 917 rushing yards , and seven touchdowns , suffered a stress fracture in his foot during the second @-@ to @-@ last Nebraska regular @-@ season game . The No. 2 rusher , DeAngelo Evans , had 776 rushing yards and a team @-@ high 14 rushing touchdowns , but was limited by a groin injury .

Wide receiver Brenden Holbein also suffered an ankle injury in practice , but was able to play . 
 At quarterback , Nebraska had Scott Frost , a transfer player from Stanford who had 1 @,@ 440 passing yards , 13 passing touchdowns , three interceptions , and 578 rushing yards in his first season with the team . Frost 's three interceptions were the third @-@ least in Division I @-@ A ; only Army and Ohio University had fewer .

Because of these numbers , he was considered one of the top quarterback prospects in the upcoming NFL draft . Despite Druckenmiller 's success , it was the Hokies ' rushing game that received most of the attention . The Hokies averaged 4 @.@ 8 yards per rushing attempt and produced 2 @,@ 504 yards rushing and 27 touchdowns during the regular season .

This followed being named National Defensive Player of the Year at the end of the previous season . Tech 's leading tackler was linebacker Brandon <unk> , who accumulated 88 during the season . Free safety Torrian Gray also was a significant presence on the Virginia Tech defense . Gray ranked No. 1 on the team in solo tackles with 58 , and was No. 3 in total tackles , with 76 . He started every game for Tech during the three seasons immediately prior to the Orange Bowl and was a second @-@ team All @-@ Big East pick in 1996 .

 In a December 26 practice , Virginia Tech linebacker Myron Newsome suffered an ankle injury that threatened to force him to sit out the Orange Bowl . Newsome , who had been a starter during the regular season , eventually recovered to participate in the game , but his injury was a point of media interest in the days prior to kickoff .

 Virginia Tech won the traditional pre @-@ game coin toss and elected to kick off to Nebraska to begin the game . The Hokie kickoff was returned to the Nebraska 25 @-@ yard line , where the Cornhuskers ran the first play of the game . On that first play , Frost completed a five @-@ yard pass to Brendan Holbein . This was followed by two rushes by Benning , who picked up 18 yards and a first down in the process . Benning then crossed into the Virginia Tech half of the field with a five @-@ yard rush . Frost then threw an incomplete pass , and Benning was unable to pick up another first down after gaining two yards on a pass from Frost . Nebraska punter Jesse <unk> came on to the field to punt to Virginia Tech . The kick sailed into the end zone for a touchback , and Virginia Tech began its first possession at its 20 @-@ yard line . 
 Tech 's first drive began inauspiciously for the Hokies . Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass on the first Tech play , then was sacked for a four @-@ yard loss . Facing third down , Druckenmiller evaded another sack and connected with Oxendine on a 41 @-@ yard pass that picked up a first down and pushed Tech into the Nebraska side of the field . Despite the gain , the Hokies were unable to gain another first down as Oxendine ran for one yard before Druckenmiller threw two successive incomplete passes . Virginia Tech punter Jimmy Kibble kicked the ball back to Nebraska , which returned it to its 15 @-@ yard line , and the Nebraska offense returned to the field . 
 With 9 : 28 remaining in the quarter , Nebraska 's second possession of the game mirrored its first . The Cornhuskers picked up a first down on a Scott Frost throw , but were unable to gain another after being stopped for a loss on one play and had to punt . Following the kick , Virginia Tech took over at its 28 @-@ yard line . The Hokies performed better than their first possession , picking up a quick first down on two rushes by Oxendine . Druckenmiller then completed a first @-@ down throw that pushed the Hokies into Nebraska territory for a second time . Druckenmiller rushed for eight yards on the next play , then ran an option with Oxendine that saw the players combine for 20 yards and a first down . Now at the Nebraska 20 @-@ yard line , Oxendine ran for a yard , pushing the Hokies into the red zone . On the first play inside the Nebraska red zone , Druckenmiller completed a 19 @-@ yard pass to Marcus Parker for a Virginia Tech touchdown — the game 's first points . Virginia Tech placekicker Shayne Graham kicked the extra point , and Virginia Tech took a 7 – 0 lead with 3 : 14 remaining in the first quarter . The drive covered 72 yards and had taken eight plays and 4 : 06 of game time . 
 Following the post @-@ touchdown kickoff and a short return , Nebraska 's offense began work at its 21 @-@ yard line . Three rushes by as many different players — Joel <unk> , Damon Benning , and Jay Sims — resulted in 11 yards and a first down . During Sims ' run , Tech 's Loren Johnson committed a 15 @-@ yard personal foul facemask penalty that pushed Nebraska to the Nebraska 47 @-@ yard line . From there , Frost threw an incomplete pass , then Sims ran twice for fifteen yards and a first down , crossing into the Virginia Tech half of the field in the process . Now at the Tech 38 @-@ yard line , Frost completed a 23 @-@ yard throw to Lance Brown , who picked up another first down at the Tech 15 @-@ yard line . With time running out in the quarter , the Cornhuskers executed a quick four @-@ yard rush to the Tech 11 @-@ yard line . At the end of the first quarter , Virginia Tech led Nebraska , 7 – 0 , but the Cornhuskers were in scoring position . 
 = = = Second quarter = = = 
 The second quarter began with Nebraska in possession of the ball at the Virginia Tech 11 @-@ yard line and facing a second down and needing six yards . On the first play of the quarter , Nebraska rusher Brian Schuster was tackled for a five @-@ yard loss in a failed trick play , pushing Nebraska back to the 16 @-@ yard line . Sims rushed for eight yards on third down , but failed to pick up the first down and Nebraska sent kicker Kris Brown into the game . Brown 's 25 @-@ yard field goal was successful , and Nebraska cut Virginia Tech 's lead to 7 – 3 with 13 : 25 remaining before halftime . 
 The post @-@ score kickoff rolled into the end zone for a touchback , and Virginia Tech began at its 20 @-@ yard line . On the first play , Nebraska committed a five @-@ yard offsides penalty . Shyrone Stith and Parker then ran for a combined six yards on the next two plays , picking up a first down with the shortened yardage provided by the penalty . From the first down at the Tech 31 @-@ yard line , Druckenmiller threw three consecutive passes : The first was incomplete , the second gained one yard , and the third gained nine yards and a first down . After that gain , however , Tech lost yardage on a rush by Oxendine , Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass , then was sacked for a loss of nine yards during the third down play . Kibble punted , and Nebraska began at the Tech 45 @-@ yard line after the kick was returned 26 yards by Michael Hawkes . The Cornhuskers took quick advantage of the good field position . Ahman Green ran 17 yards for a first down , then Frost passed for 23 yards to Kenny Cheatham , pushing Nebraska inside the Virginia Tech red zone . On just the third play after Virginia Tech 's punt , Frost ran the remaining five yards , crossing the goal line for a touchdown . The extra point was good , and with 9 : 14 remaining , Nebraska took a 10 – 7 lead . 
 Before the subsequent kickoff , Virginia Tech committed a 15 @-@ yard personal foul penalty , allowing Nebraska to kick off from the 50 @-@ yard line instead of the regulation 35 @-@ yard line . The kick resulted in a touchback , and Tech started from its 20 @-@ yard line . Oxendine picked up nine yards on a rush , and Parker earned another seven yards for a first down at the Tech 36 . Oxendine then ran three consecutive times for 17 yards and a first down . After Parker was stopped for no gain , Druckenmiller ran the ball himself for a seven @-@ yard gain and a first down at the Nebraska 40 @-@ yard line . Oxendine gained one yard on a carry to the left , but on the next play , Druckenmiller was sacked for an 11 @-@ yard loss , negating the minor gain . Druckenmiller then completed a 24 @-@ yard pass to Oxendine , but the play was negated by a holding penalty against Virginia Tech , effectively resulting in a loss of 34 yards and pushing the Hokies back to their 33 @-@ yard line . On the first play after the holding penalty , Druckenmiller fumbled the football after he was jarred by Nebraska defender Mike Rucker . The loose ball was picked up by Cornhusker Jason Peter , who ran 31 yards for a defensive touchdown . The score gave Nebraska a 17 – 7 lead with 3 : 36 remaining in the first half . 
 Following the kickoff , Virginia Tech 's offense began work to cut Nebraska 's lead before halftime . The Hokies started at their 20 @-@ yard line after a touchback , and Druckenmiller completed a 20 @-@ yard throw to Bryan Jennings after Oxendine was stopped for no gain on a carry to the left . From the Tech 40 @-@ yard line , Oxendine carried the ball 39 yards for another first down deep inside Nebraska 's half of the field . Nebraska committed a five @-@ yard offsides penalty , but Virginia Tech was stopped for short gains on the two plays following the penalty . Virginia Tech was forced to use a timeout in order to stop the clock from moving and to allow time to plan the third @-@ down play . With 57 seconds remaining in the first half , Parker ran the remaining two yards for a first down at the Nebraska 11 @-@ yard line . Druckenmiller then completed a five @-@ yard pass to Cornelius White , but because White was unable to get out of bounds or cross the goal line , Tech was again forced to call a timeout to stop the clock with 25 seconds remaining . On the next play , Druckenmiller completed a six @-@ yard pass to Shawn Scales for Tech 's second touchdown of the game . The score came with 19 seconds remaining in the first half , and the extra point was good , cutting Nebraska 's lead to 17 – 14 . 
 With just a few seconds remaining in the first half , there appeared to be little chance that Nebraska would have a chance to score . But Nebraska received the kickoff at its 24 @-@ yard line and returned it to the Nebraska 42 . Frost attempted a long pass to get Nebraska into position for a field goal attempt , but the throw fell incomplete . Instead of trying another long pass , Nebraska proceeded to run out the clock , and the Cornhuskers went into halftime with a 17 – 14 lead . 
 = = = Third quarter = = = 
 Because Nebraska received the ball to begin the game , Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half . Following the kickoff and return , Virginia Tech began at its 19 @-@ yard line . On the first play of the second half , Oxendine broke loose for a 36 @-@ yard run to the Nebraska 45 @-@ yard line and a first down . Despite that strong opening play , Tech was unable to gain another first down and was forced to punt after gaining only two additional yards . The Tech punt rolled out of bounds at the Nebraska 26 @-@ yard line . 
 The Cornhuskers ' subsequent drive did not have the initial offensive explosion of Tech 's drive , but it was in the end more successful . Benning rushed for five yards and Jeff Lake caught a 10 @-@ yard pass for a first down at the Nebraska 41 @-@ yard line . Frost then threw two incomplete passes and a nine @-@ yard toss to <unk> Jackson . Facing fourth down and needing one yard , Nebraska head coach Tom Osborne elected to attempt to gain the yardage rather than punt the ball . Benning rushed for three yards , and Nebraska was able to convert the fourth down into another first down . Benning followed that success with another , breaking loose for a 33 @-@ yard run and the first touchdown of the second half . The extra point was good , and Nebraska extended its lead to 24 – 14 with 4 : 58 remaining in the quarter . 
 Following the Nebraska kickoff , Tech tried to answer the Cornhusker score with one of its own . The Hokies started at their 20 @-@ yard line after a touchback . Parker caught an eight @-@ yard pass from Druckenmiller , then ran for three yards and a first down . With a first down at the Tech 31 @-@ yard line , Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass . This was followed by a four @-@ yard run by Oxendine and a ten @-@ yard completion by Druckenmiller for another first down , this time to the Tech 45 @-@ yard line . Oxendine picked up three yards on two short runs , then Druckenmiller advanced the Hokies into the Nebraska side of the field with a 19 @-@ yard pass to Jennings . Oxendine was stopped for no gain and Druckenmiller threw an incompletion , but on third down , Druckenmiller connected with White for a 33 @-@ yard gain and Tech 's first touchdown of the second half . The extra point was good , and the Hokies again trimmed Nebraska 's lead to three points : 24 – 21 . Tech 's drive covered 80 yards in 12 plays and 4 : 56 of game time . 
 The Cornhuskers ' offense returned to the field with 4 : 58 remaining in the third quarter . Nebraska began at its 39 @-@ yard line after the kickoff was returned 23 yards . Frost ran four yards , and Benning earned eight yards with two rushes , giving Nebraska a first down at the Tech 49 @-@ yard line . Frost 's first pass of the drive fell incomplete , but Benning ran seven yards and Frost completed his second pass of the drive for nine yards and another first down , this time to the Tech 33 @-@ yard line . Three more rushes created 10 more yards and another first down , but a bigger loss came to the Tech defense when Hokie All @-@ American Cornell Brown was injured . Nebraska 's offense inexorably pressed onward , aided by a 15 @-@ yard pass interference penalty against Virginia Tech , and Nebraska capitalized on a six @-@ yard rush by Benning , giving Nebraska a touchdown with 20 seconds remaining in the quarter . The extra point was good , and Nebraska returned to a 10 @-@ point lead , 31 – 21 . 
 Nebraska 's kickoff was returned to the Tech 19 @-@ yard line , and Oxendine ran one yard on the last play of the third quarter . With one quarter remaining in the game , Virginia Tech was in possession of the ball , but trailed , 31 – 21 . 
 = = = Fourth quarter = = = 
 The fourth quarter began with Virginia Tech in possession of the ball and facing a second @-@ and @-@ nine at its 20 @-@ yard line . On the first play of the quarter , Druckenmiller completed a 20 @-@ yard pass to Oxendine for a first down at the Tech 40 @-@ yard line . Parker ran for three yards , but Tech was forced to call a timeout before the next play . During the timeout , a light rain began to fall that would last through the remainder of the game . Coming out of the timeout , Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass , but made it up on the next play by rushing for 16 yards , picking up a first down at the 41 @-@ yard line of Nebraska . This was followed by another rush by Druckenmiller , this time for nine yards . The two gains were negated on the next play , however , as Virginia Tech committed a penalty that pushed the Hokies back to their 41 @-@ yard line . Druckenmiller then threw two incomplete passes , and Tech was forced to punt . 
 Nebraska began its possession at its five @-@ yard line after the returner was tackled for a three @-@ yard loss and the Cornhuskers were assessed six yards of penalties during the return . Frost threw an incomplete pass , Schuster ran for four yards , then Frost completed a 14 @-@ yard pass to <unk> Wiggins for a first down at the Nebraska 23 @-@ yard line . Frost continued the drive by earning nine yards on an option , then Schuster picked up three yards for another first down . Sims followed this by gaining 22 yards and two first downs on the next three plays . Frost then completed a 17 @-@ yard throw to Jeff Lake for a first down at Tech 's 26 @-@ yard line . Just outside Tech 's red zone , however , the drive petered out . Sims was stopped for a short loss , Frost ran for eight yards , and threw an incomplete pass , causing a fourth down . Kris Brown kicked his second field goal of the game , this time a 37 @-@ yard kick , which was successful . With 7 : 52 remaining in the game , Nebraska had a 34 – 21 lead . 
 With time running out , Virginia Tech 's offense returned to the field needing to score . Nebraska 's kickoff was downed in the end zone for a touchback , and the Hokies started at their 20 @-@ yard line . The Hokies ' need for quick points was foiled by an injury to Druckenmiller , who left the game after throwing an incomplete pass on the first play of the drive . Backup quarterback Al Clark was unable to gain a first down , and neither was Druckenmiller , who returned to the game for third down . Tech punted back to Nebraska , which returned the kick to its 45 @-@ yard line . 
 Cornhusker Ahman Green , who had started most of Nebraska 's games during the regular season , entered the game and ran three straight plays for 24 yards . On the third play , Green fumbled the ball , which was recovered by a Nebraska player . Frost then completed an 11 @-@ yard pass for a first down to the Tech 21 @-@ yard line . The Cornhuskers were stopped for losses on two consecutive running plays , but Frost broke free for a 22 @-@ yard touchdown run . The score and subsequent extra point gave the Cornhuskers a 41 – 21 lead with 3 : 26 remaining in the game . 
 The limited time left in the game meant there was little chance the Hokies could make good the 20 @-@ point deficit . Tech 's hopes flared after Nebraska 's kickoff was returned 67 yards to the Nebraska 25 @-@ yard line , providing a chance for a quick score . Druckenmiller completed a 14 @-@ yard pass after the long return , giving Tech a first down at the 11 @-@ yard line , but the Hokies were unable to advance the ball much further . Oxendine ran for five yards , but Druckenmiller threw three incomplete passes , turning the ball over on downs . With a firm lead , Nebraska proceeded to run four short rushes , running out the clock and bringing the game to an end . Nebraska won the 63rd Orange Bowl , 41 – 21 . 
 = = Statistical summary = = 
 From 1970 through 1998 , the Orange Bowl Committee , organizers of the Orange Bowl , recognized two most valuable players . Following the 63rd Orange Bowl , Virginia Tech running back Ken Oxendine and Nebraska running back Damon Benning were awarded the honor . Oxendine carried the ball 20 times during the game for a total of 150 rushing yards — an average of 7 @.@ 5 yards per carry . He also caught three passes for 60 yards , making him the game 's leading receiver as well as its leading rusher . Benning , meanwhile , carried the ball 15 times for 96 yards and two touchdowns . He also caught one pass for two yards and returned one kickoff 23 yards . 
 Oxendine accounted for the majority of Virginia Tech 's 193 total rushing yards , but Nebraska had many more players run the ball than just Benning , who accounted for just over one @-@ third of Nebraska 's 279 @-@ yard rushing total . Scott Frost carried the ball nine times for 62 yards and two touchdowns for the Cornhuskers , and Ahman Green , despite being hampered by his injured foot , managed seven carries for 52 yards . All told , seven Nebraska players managed to carry the ball at least once . Virginia Tech , on the other hand , saw just four players carry the ball , and its No. 2 rusher , Marcus Parker , had eight carries for 22 yards . 
 Though behind in the rushing game , Tech 's passing offense finished ahead of Nebraska 's . Hokie quarterback Jim Druckenmiller completed 16 of his 33 pass attempts , earning 214 passing yards and three touchdowns . On the opposite side of the ball , Nebraska quarterback Scott Frost earned just 136 passing yards from 11 completed passes and 22 attempts . Combining the rushing and passing totals results in a similar total offensive performance from both teams . Virginia Tech finished the game with 407 net yards from 72 offensive plays , while Nebraska eked 415 net yards from 71 offensive plays . The Hokies had a slight advantage in the time of possession , 31 : 02 to 28 : 58 . The real statistical difference comes in penalties — Tech committed five for 89 yards , while Nebraska had just three for 16 yards — and turnovers . The sole turnover in the game was a Virginia Tech fumble returned for a touchdown . Neither quarterback threw an interception . 
 Oxendine 's 150 rushing yards for Tech were the fifth @-@ highest total in the history of the Orange Bowl to that point . Druckenmiller 's three touchdown passes came behind only Notre Dame quarterback Danny Kanell 's four touchdown passes in the previous season 's Orange Bowl . Virginia Tech center Billy Conaty set a Virginia Tech record by making his 48th consecutive start in a game . 
 On defense , Virginia Tech 's Torrian Gray led all defenders with 12 total tackles . Second was Nebraska 's Mike Minter , who had 11 tackles and a pass breakup . Two Nebraska players had nine tackles apiece , and one of those players , <unk> McFarlin , recorded two tackles for loss . Nebraska recorded three sacks of Jim Druckenmiller , while the Virginia Tech defense was unable to sack Scott Frost . The Hokies did manage seven tackles for loss , compared to Nebraska 's five . 
 = = Postgame effects = = 
 Nebraska 's win pushed it to a final 1996 record of 11 – 2 , while Virginia Tech 's loss dropped it to 10 – 2 on the season . In the final Associated Press poll of the season , the Hokies finished 13th nationally . 
 Thanks to its appearance in the Orange Bowl and a revenue @-@ sharing agreement with other Big East schools , Virginia Tech earned $ 3 @.@ 981 million for playing in the 1996 Orange Bowl . $ 3 @.@ 5 million of that total came directly from the bowl , while the remaining $ 481 @,@ 000 came from the revenue @-@ sharing pool generated by all the Big East teams that participated in bowl games . The <unk> $ 4 million payout made Virginia Tech 's football team the wealthiest of the 36 schools that participated in bowl games after the 1996 season . 
 Multiple players from each team were selected in the 1997 NFL Draft , which took place April 19 – 20 , 1997 . Nebraska had eight players selected : Michael Booker , Jared Tomich , Mike Minter , Adam Treu , Chris <unk> , Jamel Williams , Eric Stokes , and Jon Hesse . 
 = Silver center cent = 
 The silver center cent is an American pattern coin , one of the precursors to the large cent and an early example of a bimetallic coin . Less than a dozen specimens are known to exist today , and they generally fetch substantial prices ; an uncirculated silver center cent sold at auction for $ 414 @,@ 000 in January 2002 . That price was eclipsed by an example graded <unk> <unk> offered at auction in April 2012 , with a price tag of more than $ 1 million . 
 = = Origins = = 
 During the early years of the American republic , there was a general consensus that the intrinsic bullion value of the new nation 's coinage should be approximately equal to its face value . Some merchants would refuse to accept coins that did not meet this standard . For most denominations , bullion parity was achieved by producing the coins in a gold or silver alloy . However , the Coinage Act of 1792 specified that the cent was to consist of 11 <unk> ( 264 grains or 17 @.@ 1 g ) of pure copper . Such a weight , needed to maintain intrinsic value , would have been too heavy for practical everyday use . 
 U.S. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson suggested an alternative : a coin made of an alloy that was primarily copper , but that included enough silver to give a reasonably @-@ sized coin an intrinsic value of one cent . This billon alloy was considered by the U.S. Mint , but U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton feared that it would be too susceptible to counterfeiting , since its appearance differed little from that of pure copper . In 1792 , the Mint 's chief coiner , Henry Voight , hit upon a solution : a copper planchet , slightly smaller than that of a modern quarter , with a small silver " plug " inserted in a center hole during the striking process . The silver plug would have been worth approximately 3 ⁄ 4 ¢ at contemporary bullion prices , while the copper planchet added an additional 1 ⁄ 4 ¢ of intrinsic value . Several such coins were produced as test pieces . Ultimately , the additional labor required for these bimetallic coins proved unsuitable for mass production , and the large cent that was produced for circulation starting in 1793 consisted of 208 grains of 100 % copper .

 The obverse of the silver center cent features a Liberty head with flowing hair . The date appears below the portrait , and the words " LIBERTY <unk> OF <unk> & <unk> .

Surrounding the wreath , " UNITED STATES OF AMERICA " is inscribed . 
 = 1948 Miami hurricane = 
 The 1948 Miami hurricane ( Air Weather Service designation : Fox ) caused no fatalities in Florida , despite moving across the Miami area as a hurricane . The ninth tropical storm and fifth hurricane of the 1948 season , the storm developed from a large low pressure area over the northwestern Caribbean Sea on October 3 . The storm intensified into a tropical storm early the next day and a hurricane several hours later . Fox then significantly deepened , peaking with winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) early on October 5 . Around that time , Fox made landfall in eastern Pinar del Río Province of Cuba . Fox crossed the island and emerged into the Straits of Florida . Late on October 5 , the hurricane struck Bahia Honda Key , Florida , with winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) and two hours later , hit Flamingo . Fox emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Fort Lauderdale early on October 6 . The storm moved northeastward and later curved to the east @-@ northeast . Late on October 7 , Fox made landfall on Bermuda with winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . Fox weakened over the next several days and later executed a large cyclonic loop . By October 16 , it became extratropical while well east @-@ southeast of Newfoundland . 
 In Cuba , homes and cattle were swept away by flash flooding . Eleven deaths and about 300 injuries were attributed to the tropical cyclone . Damage in the country reached about $ 6 million . The storm brought strong winds to Florida , with a sustained wind speed of 122 mph ( 196 km / h ) at Naval Air Station Key West . Heavy rainfall exceeding 9 @.@ 5 in ( 240 mm ) in Miami and three tornadoes also contributed to the damage in South Florida . Throughout the state , 674 homes were severely damaged or destroyed , while 45 other buildings were demolished . Overall , damage in Florida reached $ 5 @.@ 5 million and there were no deaths , but 36 injuries , none of which were serious . In Bermuda , buildings were unroofed and the sides of some structures were knocked down . Electrical light wires and telephone lines were toppled across the island . Damage totaled over $ 1 million .

 A very large but weak and elongated low pressure area first noted over the Intertropical Convergence Zone on October 1 developed into a tropical depression around 12 : 00 UTC on October 3 , while situated about 55 mi ( 90 km ) southeast of the Swan Islands . The storm intensified into a tropical storm early on October 4 and was designated as Tropical Storm Fox by the Air Weather Service in real time , although the name Fox is not included in HURDAT . Several hours later , the storm intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . A reconnaissance flight into the hurricane late on October 4 indicated winds near the center estimated at 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) . Early the following day , Fox became a Category 2 hurricane . At 06 : 00 UTC the system peaked as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) . About an hour later , Fox made landfall at the same intensity in eastern Pinar del Río Province of Cuba . Shortly before 12 : 00 UTC on October 5 , the storm emerged into the Straits of Florida . Prior to reanalysis in 2014 , it was thought that Fox briefly strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph ( 215 km / h ) , but reanalysis instead revealed that the storm weakened to 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) because the aforementioned wind speed was a gust rather than a sustained wind . 
 Fox weakened while moving northeastward and fell to Category 2 hurricane intensity by 18 : 00 UTC , at which time it made landfall on Bahia Honda Key , Florida , with winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . Continuing northeastward , the hurricane struck near Flamingo about two hours later at the same intensity . While passing near Miami early on October 6 , Fox briefly weakened to a Category 1 hurricane . Shortly thereafter , it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Fort Lauderdale and quickly re @-@ strengthened to a Category 2 hurricane . After brushing Grand Bahama island , the storm continued on its northeasterly trajectory into the open sea , until curving east @-@ northward on October 7 . Around 12 : 00 UTC , a ship observed a barometric pressure of 971 mbar ( 28 @.@ 7 inHg ) , the lowest in relation to the cyclone . Ten hours later , Fox made landfall on Bermuda with winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . The storm fell to Category 1 early on October 8 and to tropical storm status after about 24 hours . Fox then meandered out in the central Atlantic for several days and executed a large cyclonic loop between October 11 and October 14 . Fox turned northward on October 14 and began to accelerate . After curving northeastward , the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone early on October 16 while located about 535 mi ( 861 km ) east @-@ southeast of Cape Race , Newfoundland . The remnants were absorbed by a cold front several hours later . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The storm brought strong winds to Cuba , with a wind gust of 132 mph ( 212 km / h ) in Havana . The city suffered considerable damage , forcing police to patrol for looters . Nearly all of the city was left without electricity . In some portions of the neighborhood of Miramar , flooding was reported . Trees were felled onto Paseo del Prado , a famous street in Havana . In other parts of the city , falling trees and rubble also disrupted transportation . There were heavy crop losses in Havana and Pinar Del Rio provinces , where several rivers overflowed their banks . Homes and cattle were swept away by flash flooding . Overall , the hurricane left eleven fatalities , three of them due to houses collapsing on their occupants . Additionally , there were about 300 injuries and an estimated $ 6 million in damage . After the storm , Cuban President Ramón Grau , President @-@ elect Carlos Prío Socarrás , and Major General <unk> Pérez <unk> – Chief of Staff of the Army – assessed damage in the Havana area and developed plans for recovery . 
 The Hurricane Warning Service , operated by the United States Weather Bureau and the predecessor to the National Hurricane Center , issued hurricane warnings from Fort Myers to Miami , including the Florida Keys on October 4 . Miami Weather Bureau chief Grady Norton urged residents to take precautions and concentrate on further advisories . On October 5 , the hurricane warning was revised to include Naples to Jupiter . Additionally , other warnings were issued for areas surrounding Lake Okeechobee due to flooding concerns . Four U.S. Navy wartime housing project areas in Key West were evacuated . About 100 Seminoles fled the Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation , with 95 % of the property still inundated from the September hurricane . Two 25 @-@ car trains evacuated about 5 @,@ 000 people in the Lake Okeechobee area in Lake Harbor and transported them to Sebring . Many residents throughout South Florida boarded @-@ up their windows and sandbagged their properties . The American Red Cross opened 143 shelters , which 21 @,@ 663 people sought refuge in . 
 The hurricane , reminiscent of Hurricane Floyd in 1987 , produced minimal damage in the Florida Keys . Strong winds were reported at some islands , with winds well over 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) observed on Bahia Honda Key . At the Naval Air Station Key West on Boca Chica Key , several buildings were deroofed . The cyclone produced a storm surge of 4 @.@ 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) on Biscayne Bay . Rainfall exceeded 9 @.@ 5 in ( 241 @.@ 30 mm ) at the Miami airport station , inundating many streets in the city and in Hialeah , Homestead , Miami Beach , Miami Springs . In Hialeah , the city mayor reported water depths of 3 @.@ 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) in the streets . A Miami bridge , located near the Miami River , was damaged by a loose barge during the hurricane . Planes were overturned and damaged by strong winds at the Tamiami Airport . Electrical outages occurred in Miami as power lines snapped due to the wind . In Miami Beach , a fire that broke out during the storm severely damaged a meat market and destroyed a photo shop . Prior to landfall , the hurricane produced three tornadoes , all of which attained the equivalence of F2 intensity on the modern Fujita scale . A tornado destroyed three homes in the city of Opa @-@ locka , where damage reached $ 15 @,@ 000 . The tornado flipped cars and inflicted extensive damage at the Royal Palm dairy farm . 
 Another tornado touched down just south of Pompano Beach demolished 25 homes and left $ 100 @,@ 000 in damage and seven injuries . Forty @-@ four minutes later , a third tornado struck homes west of Fort Lauderdale . One building , containing two stories , lost its roof , while five homes incurred damage . Barns were damaged or destroyed . Losses reached $ 15 @,@ 000 . West Palm Beach observed wind gusts up to 62 mph ( 100 km / h ) . The hurricane caused no fatalities across the state , which the Weather Bureau considered unusual due to the storm 's path over the densely populated Miami metropolitan area . The passage of hurricane in September , which had resulted in pre @-@ existing damage , mitigated the destruction from the October hurricane .

 = Burger King legal issues = 
 The legal issues of Burger King include several legal disputes and lawsuits , as both plaintiff and defendant , of the international fast food restaurant chain Burger King ( BK ) , in the years since its founding in 1954 . Situations involving these many legal topics have affected almost every aspect of the company 's operations . Depending on the ownership and executive staff at the time of these incidents , the company 's responses to these challenges have ranged from a conciliatory dialog with its critics and litigants to a more aggressive opposition with questionable tactics and negative consequences . The company 's response to these various issues has drawn praise , scorn , and accusations of political appeasement from different parties over the years . 
 Controversies and disputes have arisen from a diverse source of group such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) over the welfare of animals , governmental and social agencies over health issues and compliance with nutritional labeling laws , and unions and trade groups over labor relations and laws . These situations have touched on the concepts of animal rights , corporate responsibility and ethics , as well as social justice . While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits , in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions , dealt with statutory compliance , or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties . The resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its suppliers and franchisees or how it does business with the public . 
 Further controversies have occurred because of the company 's involvement in the Middle East . The opening of a Burger King location in the Israeli @-@ occupied territories lead to a breach of contract dispute between Burger King and its Israeli franchise ; the dispute eventually erupted into a geopolitical conflagration involving Muslim and Jewish groups on multiple continents over the application of and adherence to international law . The case eventually elicited reactions from the members of the 22 @-@ nation Arab League ; the Islamic countries within the League made a joint threat to the company of legal sanctions including the revocation of Burger King 's business licenses within the member states ' territories . A second issue involving members of the Islamic faith over the interpretation of the Muslim version of canon law , Shariah , regarding the promotional artwork on a dessert package in the United Kingdom raised issues of cultural sensitivity , and , with the former example , posed a larger question about the lengths that companies must go to insure the smooth operation of their businesses in the communities they serve . 
 A trademark dispute involving the owners of the identically named Burger King in Mattoon , Illinois led to a federal lawsuit ; the case 's outcome helped define the scope of the Lanham act and trademark law in the United States . An existing trademark held by a shop of the same name in South Australia forced the company to change its name in Australia , while another state trademark in Texas forced the company to abandon its signature product , the Whopper , in several counties around San Antonio . Legal decisions from other suits have set contractual law precedents in regards to long @-@ arm statutes , the limitations of franchise agreements , and ethical business practices ; many of these decisions have helped define general business dealings that continue to shape the entire marketplace .

 In 2001 , the animal rights group PETA began targeting fast food chains in the United States regarding the treatment of chickens by suppliers such as Tyson Foods . Using parodies of corporate logos and slogans , the group sought to publicly embarrass the companies into changing their corporate policies in dealing with their poultry suppliers . After winning concessions from McDonald 's with its " McCruelty " campaign , the group targeted Burger King with a six @-@ month campaign it called Murder King . The group and its supporters , with the backing of celebrities including Alec Baldwin , James Cromwell , and Richard Pryor , staged protests outside Burger King restaurants across the United States , calling on the company to establish these new compliance guidelines . On June 28 , 2001 , Burger King entered into an agreement with the group and established a contractual framework that defined procedures to ensure that its suppliers were conforming to the agreed @-@ upon standards of animal welfare . These changes , along with the company 's new vegetarian offering , the BK Veggie sandwich , drew praise from the group . 
 In 2006 , PETA went before Burger King 's board of directors during its parent company 's annual corporate meeting to request that poultry suppliers switched to a more @-@ humane method of slaughter called controlled atmosphere killing ( CAK ) . Instead of using its previous tactic of stating that the procedure is more humane , the group claimed that CAK was economically more feasible as it reduces the chances of injury to workers in poultry factories and it produces better products by preventing injury to the animal . Responding to the proposal in March 2007 , Burger King announced it would make further changes to its animal @-@ welfare policies . The new policies favor suppliers of chickens that utilize CAK rather than electric shock to knock birds unconscious before slaughter , and require its pork and poultry suppliers to upgrade the living conditions of pigs and chickens . Under the agreement , 2 % of BK 's North American egg suppliers are to use cage @-@ free @-@ produced eggs and 10 % of pork suppliers are to use crate @-@ free pigs for its pork products . PETA and the Humane Society of the United States were quoted as saying that Burger King ’ s initiatives put it ahead of its competitors in terms of animal rights and welfare and that they were hopeful that the new initiatives would trigger reform throughout the fast food industry as a whole .

 Since the 1980s , several parties , including the Center for Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) , the British Heart Foundation , the City of New York , and the Spanish government , have argued that Burger King has contributed to obesity and unhealthy eating behaviors in Western nations by producing products that contain large amounts of salt , fat , trans @-@ fat and calories . After its purchase by TPG Capital from former parent company Diageo in 2002 , the company introduced several large , over @-@ sized products including its European BK XXL line , the British Angus burger six @-@ pack , the Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line . These new offerings , and others like them , have resulted in further international scorn and negative attention due the large portion size and increased amounts of unhealthy fats and trans @-@ fats in these items . Many consumer groups have accused Burger King and other fast food restaurant chains of failing to provide healthier alternatives . 
 A 1985 agreement with the New York city public health commissioner 's office , over publication of nutritional data regarding the food it sells , helped define guidelines used by the city for the dissemination of nutritional information . In a five @-@ month negotiation with Burger King and its then parent Grand Metropolitan PLC ( now part of Diageo ) , the company agreed to post complete nutritional information that complied with the Federal Government 's guidelines for the maximum daily recommended intake of fat and sodium . Additionally the data was to be presented in a format easy for the general public to understand and use . On the basis of this agreement , New York public health commissioner Mark Green , with support of Mayor David Dinkins , proposed legislation that would require all fast food restaurants to display nutritional data as well . 
 In response to the 2006 introduction of the BK XXL product line in Spain , the Spanish Health Ministry publicly claimed that the company had violated a voluntary agreement between the company and the Spanish Federation of Hoteliers and Restaurateurs , a group to which Burger King belongs , that called on its members to refrain from advertising large portions of food . The Minister of Health , Elena Salgado , claimed that the new promotion and the new sandwiches , averaging over 970 calories each , violated the accord . The head of Spain 's food regulatory body , Felix Lobo , stated a legal case could be made against Burger King for " illegally failing to comply with a contract " . In a response to the Government 's allegations , the European offices of Burger King released this statement : " In this campaign , we are simply promoting a line of burgers that has formed part of our menu in recent years . Our philosophy can be summed up with the motto ' As you like it , ' in which our customers ' taste trumps all . " The company also explained that it had always worked " to reduce the risk of illness provoked by an inadequate diet and to promote a balanced ... diet . " A spokesperson for the company stated that customers have the choice of salads versus a Whopper , that they have the option to modify their sandwiches as they please , and that the company was going to continue to advertising the products . 
 In May 2007 , the Center for Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) sought a state @-@ level class action lawsuit against Burger King in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia over the inclusion of trans @-@ fats in foods served by Burger King and Burger King 's failure to set a definitive time line for their elimination from the company 's menu . The CSPI suit sought to require the company to place large heath warnings on Burger King 's food packaging that explained the dangers of trans @-@ fat and the levels of trans @-@ fat contained in its products . Burger King sought to move the case to the Federal courts and have the suit dismissed . The Federal Court denied the company 's motion for dismissal and sent the case back to the Superior Court for trial . To address the CSPI 's legal challenge , as well as several laws passed in New York City , Philadelphia and other cities regarding the issue of trans @-@ fats in its food , BK announced a plan in July 2007 to phase out all trans @-@ fats from its products by the end of 2008 . 
 In response to the issue of childhood obesity , Burger King announced in October 2007 that it was joining The Council of Better Business Bureau 's Children 's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative . The program is a voluntary self @-@ regulation program designed to modify advertising messages aimed at children so as to encourage healthier eating habits and lifestyles . As part of its participation in the program , Burger King announced a series of steps in its advertising and children 's product lines to which it was committing itself : 
 ... In addition , Burger King Corp. will : 
 Restrict advertising to children under 12 that uses third @-@ party licensed characters to Kids Meals that meet its Nutrition Guidelines 
 Refrain from advertising in elementary schools and from product placement in media primarily aimed at children under 12 
 Promote Kids Meals that meet its Nutrition Guidelines on its Web site 
 Promote healthy lifestyles and healthy dietary choices in advertising 
 The modified Kid 's Meal line will include new products , such as broiled Chicken Tenders , apple " fries " ( French cut , raw apples served in a fry box ) , and Kraft macaroni and cheese . According to the statement by the company 's corporate parent , Burger King Brands , the meals will contain no more than 560 calories per meal , with less than 30 percent of the calories derived from fat , less than 10 percent of the calories from saturated fat , no added trans fats and no more than 10 percent of calories derived from added sugars . As of August 1 , 2008 , Burger King has introduced the product line in the United States , but not the broiled Chicken Tenders product available in the United Kingdom and Ireland . 
 = = = Labor = = = 
 A protracted South Florida labor dispute between the Coalition of Immokalee Workers ( CIW ) and growers of tomatoes in the region expanded to include Burger King and other major fast food companies , including McDonald 's and Yum ! Brands . In 2001 , the CIW sought a pay raise for tomato pickers in the region and , starting with its Boot the Bell campaign aimed at Yum ! subsidiary Taco Bell , began to target the chains with protests , letter writing campaigns , and petitions demanding that the companies purchase tomatoes only from suppliers who agree to the pay increase . The campaign , which eventually attracted the support of religious groups , labor organizations , student groups and anti @-@ slavery activists , became known as the Campaign for Fair Food with a stated goal to increase the wages of the pickers by 1 ¢ per pound picked above the 45 ¢ paid per bucket at the time , or about 77 ¢ for each 32 @-@ pound ( 14 @.@ 5 kg ) bucket in 2005 US dollars . In 2005 , McDonald 's Corporation and Yum ! signed agreements acquiescing to the group 's purchasing demands , although implementation was put on hold due to threats by the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange to fine its members $ 100 @,@ 000 if they complied ; however , Burger King corporate parent Burger King Brands declined to enter into a similar agreement with the group . 
 A December 2007 QSR Magazine article about the conflict claimed that Burger King Brands had devised a contingency plan to remove itself from the dispute . Citing internal company documents , the Associated Press stated BK had concerns that such agreements might prove to be a possible violation of anti @-@ trust laws , had possible tax implications , and that there were issues with third @-@ party oversight for the agreements . As part of the company 's plan , QSR Magazine claimed that the company was going to cease purchasing product from suppliers with whom the CIW was in disagreement . In response , the company issued a press release in February 2007 claiming that while it is a large purchaser , it is not responsible for the pay rates of it suppliers ' workers as wage disputes are the province of the producer . BK also pointed out that it has an open offer of employment for any dissatisfied CIW members and scholarships ( through its Have it Your Way Foundation ) for family members of CIW workers . 
 In the release , Steven Grover , BK Vice President of Global Food Safety , Quality Assurance , and Regulatory Compliance , confirmed the factuality of the QSR report and that if the dispute between the growers and the CIW continues , the company would go forward with its plans to stop purchasing tomatoes from farms in the Immokalee region . The company stated it would purchase only one percent of its tomatoes from that area and other suppliers could easily make up the difference . Speaking on the dispute , Grover stated , " We ’ re being asked to do something that we have legal questions about . We want to find a way to make sure that workers are protected and receive a decent wage . " CIW spokesperson Julia Perkins faulted this move , stating , " ... farm workers across the country and world face the same problems as those in the Immokalee region , but many do not have a human rights organization , such as the CIW , to stand up for their interests . Running away from the scene of the crime , does that make you any more innocent ? Are they really willing to pay an exorbitantly higher transportation cost [ s ] to bring in tomatoes from overseas or Mexico and pass that on to their customers rather than pay a penny more per pound ? " 
 In an April 2008 Senate hearing chaired by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I @-@ VT ) regarding farm conditions , Eric Schlosser , author of the best @-@ selling Fast Food Nation , commented on Burger King 's recalcitrance to sign an agreement with the CIW while Yum ! and McDonald 's had . Schlosser stated , " The admirable behavior of these two industry giants makes the behavior or Burger King ... seem completely unjustifiable . " 
 In May 2008 , several issues came to the fore that damaged the credibility of Burger King and its position on the topic . Steven Grover was found to be trolling websites that have posted pro @-@ CIW positions and opinions ; under an assumed screen name , Grover posted several comments disparaging the ethics and honesty of the leadership of the group . Besides the trolling incident , Grover was tied to several terse , stridently worded e @-@ mails sent from a possibly fictitious employee name at the BK global headquarters in Miami to supporters and media groups ; the company labeled these communications as unsanctioned and not reflecting official corporate positions . Additionally , Burger King was found to have hired an outside security company , Pembroke Pines , Florida based Diplomatic Tactical Services , to infiltrate the CIW and its supporting groups and spy on their members . After these issues came to light , BK terminated Grover and company spokesman Keva Silversmith , as well as its relationship with Diplomatic Tactical Services . Critics of the personnel action , such as PR Watch editor Sheldon Rampton , noted that it appeared that the two terminated employees were being made scapegoats by the company . Rampton went on to note that Silversmith had been , up to a few weeks before the story came to light , employed by the PR firm Edelman , which had been contracted by company parent Burger King Brands to provide PR services ; Edelman has employed tactics on the behalf of its other clients , Wal @-@ Mart and Microsoft , which Rampton and his organization termed " sleazy " . Sen. Sanders agreed with Rampton 's claim of scapegoating , and called for hearings into the incidents to investigate the company 's behaviors to see if other Burger King officers had instigated the attacks on the labor group as company policy . Sanders stated that he wished to " make sure that we find out how high up the corporate ladder this scheme went " . 
 The issue was resolved on May 23 , 2008 when BK CEO John Chidsey announced an agreement with the CIW granting the requested 1 ¢ pay increase to the workers . Chidsey also apologized on behalf of the company for the comments made about the pickers and the behavior of Grover and Silversmith . Additionally , the company agreed to provide a ½ ¢ per pound payment to the CIW to cover payroll taxes and administrative costs for the tomato growers .

 In the summer of 1999 , a geopolitical dispute with the global Islamic community and Jewish groups in the United States and Israel arose over an Israeli franchisee opening stores in the Israeli @-@ occupied territories . When Burger King franchisee in Israel , Rikamor , Ltd . , opened a store in the West Bank settlement of Ma 'aleh Adumim in August of that year , Islamic groups , including the Arab League and American Muslims for Jerusalem , argued that international Burger King parent Burger King Corporation 's licensing of the store helped legitimize the illegal settlement . Beyond the called @-@ for Islamic boycott of the company , the Arab League also threatened the revocation of the business licenses of Burger King 's primary Middle Eastern franchise in the 22 countries that are part of the League 's membership . 
 Burger King Corporation quickly pulled the franchise license for that location and had the store shuttered explaining that Rikamor , Ltd. had violated its contract by opening the location in the West Bank . Several American @-@ based Jewish groups issued statements that denounced the decision as acceding to threats of boycotts by Islamic groups . Burger King Corporation issued a statement that it " made this decision purely on a commercial basis and in the best interests of thousands of people who depend on the Burger King reputation for their livelihood " . 
 = = = Islamic relations = = = 
 An issue of a religious nature arose in 2005 in the United Kingdom when Burger King introduced a new prepackaged ice cream product ; the label of the product included a silhouette of the ice cream that when rotated on its side bore a resemblance to the Islamic inscription for God , Allah ( الله ) . When a British Muslim named Rashad Akhtar , a resident of the community of High Wycombe , was presented with the ice cream cone in a Park Royal Burger King restaurant , he noticed the resemblance and became angered at what he felt was an offense to the Islamic faith . After being informed of the likeness , the local Islamic group Muslim Council of Britain pointed out the issue of the possible interpretation to Burger King and its relevance to Shariah , the Muslim version of canon law which governs the lives of members of the Islamic faith and carries the same weight as civil law in their belief structure . The company responded by voluntarily recalling the product and reissuing it with a new label . The Muslim Council praised the company for its " sensitive and prompt action " in resolving the matter ; however , Akhtar was not satisfied with the company 's withdrawal of the product . 
 In response to the perceived blasphemy , Akhtar declared it was his personal jihad to find those responsible for the packaging and destroy their professional status , personal life and the UK as a whole for having a culture allowing the insult to occur . This event , Akhtar 's reaction and other similar issues with companies such as Nike and Unilever have been used by conservative political critics , such as James Joyner , claiming that western nations and organizations are kowtowing in too easily to Muslims ' claims or threats and by commentators , including author Daniel C. Dennett , highlighting how factions of the Islamic faith gravitate towards iconoclasm .

 = = = Burger King Corporation v. Hungry Jack 's Pty Limited = = = 
 When Burger King moved to expand its operations into Australia in the early 1970s , its business name was already trademarked by a takeaway food shop in Adelaide . As a result , Burger King provided the Australian franchisee , Jack Cowin , with a list of possible alternative names derived from pre @-@ existing trademarks already registered by Burger King and its then corporate parent Pillsbury that could be used to name the Australian restaurants . Cowin selected the Hungry Jack brand name , one of Pillsbury 's US pancake mixture products , and slightly changed the name to the possessive form , Hungry Jack 's . The first Australian franchise of Burger King Corporation was established in Perth in 1971 , under the auspices of Cowin 's new company Hungry Jack 's Pty , Limited . 
 In 1990 , Hungry Jack 's renewed its franchise agreement with then BK parent Burger King Corporation , which allowed Hungry Jack 's to license third party franchisee . One of the terms and conditions of the renewed agreement required Hungry Jack 's to open a minimum number of new locations each year for the duration of the contract . Shortly after the Australian trademark on the Burger King name lapsed in 1996 , Burger King requested that Cowin rebrand the Hungry Jack 's locations to Burger King , which Cowin declined . Burger King Corporation accused Hungry Jack 's of violating the conditions of the renewed franchise agreement by failing to expand the chain at the rate defined and sought to terminate the agreement . Under the aegis of this claim , Burger King Corporation , in partnership with Royal Dutch Shell 's Australian division Shell Company of Australia Ltd . , began to open its own stores in 1997 beginning in Sydney and extending throughout the regions of New South Wales , Australian Capital Territory and Victoria . In addition , BK sought to limit HJ 's ability to open new locations in the country , whether they were corporate locations or third @-@ party licensees . 
 As a result of Burger King 's actions , Hungry Jack 's owner Jack Cowin and his private holding company Competitive Foods Australia began legal proceedings in 2001 against Burger King 's parent Burger King Corporation with a counter @-@ claim that the company had violated the conditions of the master franchising agreement and was in breach of the contract . In a decision handed down by the Supreme Court of New South Wales that affirmed Cowin 's claims , Burger King was determined to have violated the terms of the contract and as a result was required to pay Cowin and Hungry Jack 's a A $ 46 @.@ 9 million ( US $ 41 @.@ 6 million 2001 ) award . The court 's decision was one of the first major cases in Australia that implied that the American legal concept of good faith negotiations existed with the framework of the Australian legal system , which until that verdict , had rarely been seen in the country 's courts . In its decision , the Court stated that Burger King had failed to act in good faith during contract negotiations by seeking to include standards and clauses that would engineer a default of the franchise agreement , allowing the company to limit the number of new Hungry Jack ’ s branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own , a purpose that was extraneous to the agreement . 
 After Burger King Corporation lost the case , it decided to terminate its operations in the country , and in July 2002 , the company transferred its assets to its New Zealand franchise group , Trans @-@ Pacific Foods ( TPF ) . The terms of the sale had TPF assume oversight of the Burger King franchises in the region as the Burger King brand 's master franchisee . Trans @-@ Pacific Foods administered the chain 's 81 locations until September 2003 when the new management team of Burger King Corporation reached an agreement with Hungry Jack 's Pty Ltd to re @-@ brand the existing Burger King locations to Hungry Jack 's and make HJP the sole master franchisee of both brands . An additional part of the agreement required Burger King Corporation to provide administrative and advertising support as to insure a common marketing scheme for the company and its products . Trans @-@ Pacific Foods transferred its control of the Burger King franchises to Hungry Jack 's Pty Ltd , which subsequently renamed the remaining Burger King locations as Hungry Jack 's . 
 = = = Burger King v. Rudzewicz = = = 
 In 1979 , two Michigan businessmen , John Rudzewicz and Brian MacShara , entered into a franchise agreement with Burger King to run a restaurant in Detroit , Michigan . After MacShara attended four months of training courses at the regional Burger King training facilities in Michigan and in the Florida headquarters on how to operate and administer a Burger King franchise , it was agreed that the partners would take over operation of an existing Burger King location in Drayton Plains , Michigan . However , during this time disagreements arose between the partners and BK over issues of rent , construction fees , building designs and the assignment of legal liabilities . MacShara and Ruzewicz finally signed their franchise agreement after gaining limited concessions over the issues , with Rudzewicz assuming a 20 @-@ year , $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 financial obligation over the life of the contract . 
 Due to a recessionary period in the United States beginning with the energy crisis in late 1979 , sales began to decline at the location and the partnership failed to pay their required franchise fees and rent service to Burger King Corporation . After attempts over the intervening months to negotiate a compromise with MacShara and Ruzewicz failed , Burger King terminated the franchise agreement and ordered the pair to vacate the property . Rudzewicz and MacShara refused to comply and continued operation of their restaurant even after they were served the notice . Burger King response was to file a lawsuit in May 1981 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida claiming breach of contract and trademark infringement . Burger King sought an injunction against the pair preventing them from operating the restaurant and seeking damages because MacShara and Ruzewicz were " ... tortiously infringing its [ Burger King ] trademarks and service marks through their continued , unauthorized operation as a Burger King restaurant " . The company also sought reimbursement of all legal fees and costs associated with the filing . 
 The defendants , MacShara and Rudzewicz , filed a motion to dismiss the case on the argument as Michigan residents , the District Court of Southern Florida did not have jurisdiction . After a hearing , the Court ruled that Florida has personal jurisdiction under State of Florida 's long @-@ arm statute , stating that " ... a non @-@ resident Burger King franchise is subject to the personal jurisdiction of this Court in actions arising out of its franchise agreements " . The partners filed a counter claim and alleged Burger King had violated Michigan 's Franchise Investment Law and sought damages and fees . After a short trial , the Court found for Burger King and ordered Rudzewicz and MacShara to close the restaurant and awarded BK damages , fees , and costs . 
 After the loss , MacShara withdrew from the case but Rudzewicz appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit . In the filing , Rudzewicz claimed that since they were residents of Michigan , and because the claims did not arise within the Southern District of Florida , that District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over them . Additionally Rudzewicz argued that the long @-@ arm statute violated the 14th Amendment and was unconstitutional . Citing a similar case , World @-@ Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson , the Appeals court agreed with the defendants and overturned the lower court 's decision . The court also agreed with Rudzewicz 's assertion of the constitutionality of Florida 's long arm statute in its application to the case . 
 In turn , Burger King Corporation asked for a rehearing , which was denied . Burger King then filed an appeal to the US Supreme Court , which agreed to hear the case on its merits , after which it would decide if it had jurisdiction to grant a writ of certiorari . In its decision , the Supreme Court overturned the Appellate Court and found that Florida does have jurisdiction in the case . The Court concluded that the defendants , Rudzewicz and MacShara , sought out their franchise in the state of Florida and were availed of the protections of that state and were , therefore , subject to jurisdiction there . Additionally , the Court reasoned that the defendants had a " substantial and continuing " relationship with Burger King in Florida and that due process would not be violated because the defendants should have reasonably anticipated being summoned into court in Florida for breach of contract . 
 The decision in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , has been criticized as complicating " personal jurisdiction jurisprudence by creating , in dicta , a new bifurcated test " that duplicates a venue analysis , adds little to the minimum contacts inquiry , hinders predictability , is a burdensome process , and potentially allows a plaintiff to manipulate a defendant 's constitutional rights . 
 = = = Burger King of Florida , Inc. v. Hoots = = = 
 As the company expanded , it was subject to several legal issues regarding trademarks . Because of its use as a case study in American law schools , one of the most prominent incidents of infringement in the United States occurred with the similarly named Burger King located in Mattoon , Illinois . Eugene and Elizabeth Hoots owned an ice cream shop in the city of Mattoon ; due to the success of the store , in 1957 they expanded it with an additional shop in a former garage next to the original operation . Keeping with theme related to the name of the ice cream shop , Frigid Queen , they named their burger stand Burger King and registered their trademark with the state of Illinois in 1959 . In 1962 The Hootses , with knowledge of the Federal trademark held by Burger King Corporation , added a second location in Charleston , Illinois . 
 In 1961 , with its first location in Skokie , Illinois , Burger King Corporation and its franchises began opening stores and by 1967 had over 20 locations spread throughout the state . The Hootses , claiming that their trademark gave them exclusive rights to the name in Illinois sued BK in the state , and later federal , courts under the case Burger King of Florida , Inc. v. Hoots 403 F.2d 904 ( 7th Cir . 1968 ) . The decision issued by United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois , and upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit , stated that the BK federal trademark , applied for in 1961 and granted in 1963 , took precedence over the Hootses ' older , state trademark ; The Court granted the Hootses exclusive rights to the Burger King trademark within a circular area defined with a 20 @-@ mile ( 32 km ) radius centered on their original location . 
 The Burger King v. Hoots trademark dispute and its resulting decision went beyond the original case , it established a major legal precedent in the United States in regards to the Lanham Act . The ruling states that while the senior user of the state service mark or trademark has prior usage of the common law marks , federal statute overrides the earlier , state service mark and prohibits the senior user from preventing the junior user from exercising the use of the federally registered mark outside a defined geographic reach of the senior user . 
 The Hoots decision would again affect Burger King as it moved into the state of Texas . When Burger King expanded into the San Antonio area , it was prevented from utilizing the name of its signature product , the Whopper , in its local advertising and stores due to a prior state registered service mark owned by a local chain known as Whopper Burger . The chain , owned by Frank and Barbara Bates , prevented the company from using the name in Bexar County for several years until Mrs. Bates , the CEO of Whopper Burger after the death of her husband in 1983 , retired and sold the chain with its related trademarks to then @-@ corporate parent Pillsbury in the mid @-@ 1980s . 
 = Joppenbergh Mountain = 
 Joppenbergh Mountain is a nearly 500 @-@ foot ( 152 m ) mountain in Rosendale Village , a hamlet in the town of Rosendale , in Ulster County , New York . The mountain is composed of a carbonate bedrock overlain by glacially deposited material . It was named after Rosendale 's founder , Jacob Rutsen , and mined throughout the late 19th century for dolostone that was used in the manufacture of natural cement . Extensive mining caused a large cave @-@ in on December 19 , 1899 , that destroyed equipment and collapsed shafts within Joppenbergh . Though it was feared that several workers had been killed , the collapse happened while all the miners were outside , eating lunch . Since the collapse , the mountain has experienced shaking and periodic rockfalls . 
 During the late 1930s , Joppenbergh became the site of several ski jumping competitions , which continued until the early 1940s . The original slope was designed by Harold Schelderup for Rosendale 's first competition in 1937 ; Schelderup himself skied that July , after the slope was coated with borax for a summer competition . Several Olympic skiers participated in the competitions . Skiing began again in the 1960s , when a new slope was built on the mountain , and the revived competitions continued until 1971 . 
 The town of Rosendale considered buying land near the mountain in 2003 for parking , and the following year , the town leased a tract of land to build a municipal parking lot . Joppenbergh was put up for sale in 2009 , and in March 2011 , the Open Space Institute ( OSI ) offered to purchase the entire 117 @-@ acre ( 47 ha ) property and sell it to the town . The Rosendale town board initially agreed to the deal the following month , with payment planned to come from a surplus fund . That June , however , the board found that the surplus fund had already been exhausted and could not cover the entire cost of the purchase . Ultimately , the OSI completed its purchase of Joppenbergh in October 2011 , without town money .

 Joppenbergh is named after Colonel Jacob Rutsen , born Jacobsen Rutger van <unk> . Rutsen was a merchant , and the son of a Dutch immigrant , from Albany ; he founded the first settlement in what is now the town of Rosendale , New York , in the late 17th century . The spelling of the mountain 's name has been disputed , and has been rendered as <unk> and <unk> . It has also been called Jacob 's Nose , Jacob 's Mount , and , in an early 18th @-@ century deed , <unk> . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Sources differ on whether Joppenbergh is 485 feet ( 148 m ) or 495 feet ( 151 m ) . Both measurements give Joppenbergh a lower elevation than the highest point in the town of Rosendale , a 600 @-@ foot ( 180 m ) peak of the Shawangunk Ridge . 
 The bedrock underlying the mountain is composed of limestone and dolostone members of the Helderberg Group , laid during the Paleozoic era . Most of the Helderberg carbonates in Rosendale are located north of the Rondout Creek , and have given Rosendale a karst topography , resulting in " sink holes , disappearing streams , caves , and springs " . The mountain 's surface is composed of unconsolidated , glacially deposited outwash and till , with several outcrops exposing Joppenbergh 's bedrock . Soils have been mapped as Farmington @-@ Rock outcrop complex . In some areas , the soil depth is less than 20 inches ( 51 cm ) , which hinders groundwater filtration . Other parts of the mountain have a steep , 30 percent grade . These areas , comprising nearly 75 percent of the 117 @-@ acre ( 47 ha ) property , cannot be easily developed .

 In 1825 , engineers working on the Delaware and Hudson Canal found large numbers of dolostone rocks in the region , which enabled the production of natural cement . The rocks contained dolomite of the Upper Silurian 's Rondout formation . Joppenbergh was rich in the mineral , and was mined . Several quarries operated on the mountain , including the New York and Rosendale Cement Company , and the James Cement Company . No one company had complete control of the entire mountain . 
 By late December 1899 , mining had compromised Joppenbergh 's integrity enough to cause a series of landslides , followed by a large cave @-@ in on December 19 . Four collapses occurred that day , beginning at 8 AM , and culminating in the 11 : 30 AM collapse of the Black Smoke Mine shaft network . Though it was initially believed that fifteen workers had been killed , the collapse happened while all 150 men were outside of the mountain , eating lunch . 
 The collapse rendered the canal and nearby road impassable , and caused a boiler explosion that shook the nearby Rosendale trestle . At the time of the collapse , the total cost of the damage was estimated to be between $ 20 @,@ 000 and $ 25 @,@ 000 . Another , larger collapse happened the following week , late at night . This cave @-@ in was believed to have been caused by the December 19 collapse . Shortly after the landslides , " swarms of <unk> spectators " crowded the village to photograph the debris ; one such photograph was alleged to depict the Madonna . Frequent rockfalls as a result of mining led to calls to destroy the mountain in 1907 . 
 = = = Skiing competitions = = = 
 Throughout the 1930s the tourist industry in Rosendale flourished , generating almost $ 700 @,@ 000 each year between spring and autumn . The Rosendale Township Association , founded in 1934 to encourage tourism in the town , sought out new activities to attract tourists to Rosendale during the winter . In 1936 the association asked a Brooklyn @-@ based <unk> skiing club to build its new 40 @-@ meter ( 130 ft ) ski jumping slope in Rosendale . The group leased Joppenbergh from owner Warren Sammons . 
 Rosendale 's first ski jumping competition was held on January 24 , 1937 . The ski track was designed by Harold Schelderup , a ski hill designer from Norway . Bad weather caused the cancellation of competitive events , but a skiing exhibition still occurred . That April , the Telemark club held a special dinner in Brooklyn to honor members who performed well in the January competition . The club planned to hold a summer competition by covering the mountain with " straw and pine needles " . Harold Schelderup , who was recognized at the dinner for his skills , performed in the summer tournament . Joppenbergh 's ski track was coated with borax , and the tournament was held on July 18 , 1937 at 2 : 30 in the afternoon , with enough parking provided for 500 cars . In front of a crowd of 3 @,@ 300 people , " jumpers took off from an in @-@ run covered with borax and landed on a hill covered with mats and carpets topped with straw and borax " . 
 Olympic skier <unk> Satre set a record jump of 112 feet ( 34 m ) in 1937 . The following year a 25 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) extension was placed atop the mountain to increase jumpers ' distance . Although Satre 's 112 @-@ foot ( 34 m ) record was expected to be beaten by more than 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) , the winner of the January 23 , 1938 competition was Norwegian skier Nils <unk> , who jumped only 128 feet ( 39 m ) . Harold Schelderup also participated in the competition , which was held the week after he won a separate tournament in White Plains . Another Joppenbergh tournament was planned for March 7 , 1938 . Competitions were held in 1940 and 1941 . The length of the slope was increased to 50 meters ( 160 ft ) in 1941 , but the United States ' entrance into World War II caused skiers to enter the military , and competitions were not held after the war . 
 Skiing resumed on Joppenbergh in the 1960s . The Rosendale Nordic Ski Club was organized on January 11 , 1964 , and immediately created the Joppenbergh Mountain Corporation ( JMC ) to manage the Joppenbergh property . Three hundred shares of stock were issued for the JMC , priced at $ 100 per share , to build a new slope – and to buy the mountain itself for $ 20 @,@ 000 from its owner , Mary Sammons . The JMC gained control of the property on August 20 , 1964 , and immediately announced its intent to build a new ski slope on the site of the original one , as well as a parking lot capable of holding 10 @,@ 000 cars . The goal of the club was to make Rosendale the " Nordic Ski Capital of the East " . A new 70 @-@ meter ( 230 ft ) slope was completed on November 14 , 1965 , and augmented by a snowmaking system to provide artificial snow . When a ski jumping competition was held on January 30 , 1966 , skier Leif <unk> achieved a 152 @-@ foot ( 46 m ) jump from the new slope . Competitions were held January 22 , 1967 and January 27 , 1968 . The winner of the 1968 tournament was Per <unk> , a 22 @-@ year @-@ old Dartmouth student who reached 206 feet ( 63 m ) . The slope was icy prior to the competition ; a snowmaking machine was used the night before the jump , and club members , as well as the competitors themselves , " help [ ed ] manicure the slope " . When the jump began , the slope was in fine condition . 
 The Rosendale Outing Ski Club organized a competition on January 25 and 26 , 1969 , attended by a crowd of 3 @,@ 000 people . Olympic medalist Franz Keller jumped 212 feet ( 65 m ) down a 65 @-@ meter ( 213 ft ) slope on Joppenbergh , though he managed to reach 214 feet ( 65 m ) during practice . It had rained the week before the competition , and although 20 truckloads of snow were brought in , the condition of the track was " extremely fast " . Several participants fell , and one was brought to a hospital in Kingston . 
 A jump took place on January 18 , 1970 , the same year that the Rosendale Outing Ski Club became part of the Rosendale Nordic Ski Club . The new club organized Rosendale 's final skiing competition , which took place on February 6 and 7 , 1971 . Keller 's 212 @-@ foot ( 65 m ) record was broken twice on February 6 , by Middlebury College student Hugh Barber . The 185 @-@ pound ( 84 kg ) Barber reached heights of 213 feet ( 65 m ) and 217 feet ( 66 m ) during the competition , and 226 feet ( 69 m ) during practice , in front of 3 @,@ 500 spectators . Although Barber believed the ski hill was in " great condition " , 10 to 15 percent of participants had fallen during the tournament . Consistently unfavorable weather conditions and a lack of profitability were the major reasons skiing stopped on Joppenbergh ; the poor design of the slope , as well as infighting among ski club members , also contributed . The slope was subsequently abandoned , and an adjacent facility , for the ski jumps , fell into disuse . The JMC continued to own and maintain the property after skiing ceased .

 Periodic rockfalls continue to happen , with debris sliding down the mountain face . In 1984 , State Route 213 was moved 50 feet ( 15 m ) away from Joppenbergh and closer to Rondout Creek to protect motorists . A retaining wall was put up at the foot of the mountain to prevent falling rocks from rolling onto the street . During the 1980s , <unk> TV Systems leased part of the mountain from the JMC to set up an antenna . Cellular One considered building a 180 @-@ foot ( 55 m ) cell tower on top of Joppenbergh in 1992 , but decided not to do so . Although there was public opposition to the proposal , Cellular One stated that local sentiment was not a factor in its decision against building the tower . In 1995 the mountain was studied by the New York Public Service Commission to determine a possible route for new transmission lines laid by a local energy utility . 
 The body of a 25 @-@ year @-@ old substitute teacher from Kingston , Amy <unk> , was found on Joppenbergh after an October 1998 search . Police determined that she died of head trauma following a fall . Her car had been found in a parking lot by the mountain . 
 In 2003 , the town of Rosendale considered either leasing a tract of land near Joppenbergh , or purchasing a 1 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 61 ha ) lot , to expand parking on Main Street . The lot belonged to former village mayor Joseph Reid , who refused to sell it to the town . Although the town board considered using eminent domain to acquire Reid 's property , it agreed in June 2004 to lease the Joppenbergh property instead , for a period of 10 years , at a rate of $ 3 @,@ 500 each year . One member of the town board opposed the deal because it would not secure the land beyond the 10 @-@ year term . The lease allowed the town to create a park by the municipal lot , Willow Kiln Park , which contains several defunct cement kilns . Willow Kiln Park has served as the setting of an art show and , following a zombie @-@ themed street festival , a concert . 
 Though the JMC had been unwilling to sell its land in 2004 , by December 2009 the entire mountain was put up for sale , for $ 500 @,@ 000 . Before 2009 , the assessed value of the property was only about $ 50 @,@ 000 . In early March 2011 , the Open Space Institute ( OSI ) offered to purchase the 117 @-@ acre ( 47 ha ) property – which had , by that time , been reassessed at $ 240 @,@ 000 – for $ 185 @,@ 000 , and sell it to the town for $ 85 @,@ 000 . The deal would create an easement with the town , allowing only noncommercial use of the mountain while preserving the municipal parking lot at its base . While some government officials viewed such an acquisition as a permanent solution to the hamlet 's parking problems , other officials viewed the loss of tax revenue from the privately owned property to be undesirable . 
 More than 175 people showed up for a rancorous public hearing over the purchase on April 6 , 2011 . During the hearing , members of the Rosendale town board determined that the tax income from the entire property was much less than the cost of renting part of it for parking . Residents brought up several issues , such as the liability the town would assume from falling rocks , and sinkholes . Other issues discussed were the lack of road access to the parking lot , and whether the property should be used commercially . An individual living adjacent to the property , Brett Hansen , expressed a strong desire to buy it and build additional parking lots , as well as an amphitheater . Proponents of the purchase described how ownership of Joppenbergh would allow Rosendale to connect the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail with Main Street , and how property values near the mountain would increase . The town board agreed to the purchase in a 3 – 2 vote on April 13 . 
 Although a 17 @-@ page petition with 298 signatures in favor of a public referendum was presented at the meeting , the board felt that OSI funds would not be available by the proposed November referendum . Opponents of the board 's decision protested it by placing signs near the mountain deriding the purchase as an unwise expenditure . The town was not legally obligated to hold a referendum , regardless of public sentiment , because the money budgeted for the purchase was not borrowed ; board members planned to tap a $ 340 @,@ 000 surplus fund , generated by the 2010 sale of town land to the OSI , which intended to allow bouldering on the property . The $ 340 @,@ 000 fund was originally intended for capital improvements , specifically the construction of a new town hall , but a June 2011 audit of the town 's 2010 budget found that a large part of the surplus had already been used to offset budget and tax shortfalls ; only $ 79 @,@ 000 remained available . 
 Several local businesses considered contributing money to the mountain 's purchase . Such funding would be considered surplus , and would not be subject to referendum . Owners of businesses on Main Street expressed concern at the June 1 town board meeting that the cost of parking would increase if the property was purchased by a third party . One board member estimated that without paying rent , the town would recoup the cost of the property within 12 years . Ulster County Area Transit expressed a desire to route its buses through the property , creating a connection to the Mohonk Preserve . A nonprofit organization , the Joppenbergh Mountain Preservation Association , was created in June 2011 to raise funding to purchase the mountain , the parking lot , and Willow Kiln Park . 
 In an effort to reduce the purchase price , the town board asked the mountain 's current owners to discount the final four years of rent on the parking lot , a cost of $ 32 @,@ 000 . The town considered buying only the parking lot and Willow Kiln Park , but the JMC 's lawyer indicated that the 117 @-@ acre ( 47 ha ) property would not be divided . Ultimately , the OSI bought Joppenbergh without any financial assistance from the town , gaining ownership of the property in October 2011 , although the sale was not completed until December 20 , 2011 . By that time , most of the JMC 's stockholders had died , and ownership of the property generated so little income that it served " no further business purpose " . Joppenbergh was a point of contention during the town 's November 2011 elections , with Republicans criticizing the affair as " reflect [ ing ] poorly on town Democrats ' fiscal management skills " . The town of Rosendale approached the OSI in January 2012 to renew its lease of the parking lot , which was set to expire at the end of 2013 . 
 In 2012 the OSI transferred ownership of the property to a local conservancy , the Wallkill Valley Land Trust ( WVLT ) . An informal association of businesses , the Joppenbergh Mountain Advisory Group ( <unk> ) , began working with the WVLT to create a land use policy . The WVLT began having monthly meetings with the <unk> , and with town and state departments ; its stated goal was to combine Joppenbergh 's development with the rehabilitation of the adjacent railroad trestle and subsequent expansion of the rail trail . In late September 2012 , the WVLT held a hearing on a proposed land use plan that would allow deer hunting on the property beginning in 2013 , and would prohibit entry into several caves on the mountain . 
 = The Basement Tapes = 
 The Basement Tapes is a studio album by American singer @-@ songwriter Bob Dylan and the Band , released on June 26 , 1975 by Columbia Records . It is Dylan 's sixteenth studio album . The songs featuring Dylan 's vocals were recorded in 1967 , eight years before the album 's release , at houses in and around Woodstock , New York , where Dylan and the Band lived . Although most of the Dylan songs had appeared on bootleg records , The Basement Tapes marked their first official release . 
 During his world tour of 1965 – 66 , Dylan was backed by a five @-@ member rock group , the Hawks , who would subsequently become famous as the Band . After Dylan was injured in a motorcycle accident in July 1966 , four members of the Hawks gravitated to the vicinity of Dylan 's home in the Woodstock area to collaborate with him on music and film projects . While Dylan was concealed from the public 's gaze during an extended period of convalescence in 1967 , they recorded more than 100 tracks together , incorporating original compositions , contemporary covers and traditional material . Dylan 's new style of writing moved away from the urban sensibility and extended narratives that had characterized his most recent albums , Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde , toward songs that were more intimate and which drew on many styles of traditional American music . While some of the basement songs are humorous , others dwell on nothingness , betrayal and a quest for salvation . In general , they possess a rootsy quality anticipating the Americana genre . For some critics , the songs on The Basement Tapes , which circulated widely in unofficial form , mounted a major stylistic challenge to rock music in the late sixties . 
 When Columbia Records prepared the album for official release in 1975 , eight songs recorded solely by the Band — in various locations between 1967 and 1975 — were added to sixteen songs taped by Dylan and the Band in 1967 . Overdubs were added in 1975 to songs from both categories . The Basement Tapes was critically acclaimed upon release , reaching number seven on the Billboard 200 album chart . Subsequently , the format of the 1975 album has led critics to question the omission of some of Dylan 's best @-@ known 1967 compositions and the inclusion of material by the Band that was not recorded in Woodstock . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 By July 1966 , Bob Dylan was at the peak of both creative and commercial success . Highway 61 Revisited had reached number three on the US album chart in November 1965 ; the recently released double @-@ LP Blonde on Blonde was widely acclaimed . From September 1965 to May 1966 , Dylan embarked on an extensive tour across the US , Australia and Europe backed by the Hawks , a band that had formerly worked with rock and roll musician Ronnie Hawkins . The Hawks comprised four Canadian musicians — Rick Danko , Garth Hudson , Richard Manuel and Robbie Robertson — and one American , Levon Helm . Dylan 's audiences reacted with hostility to the sound of their folk icon backed by a rock band . Dismayed by the negative reception , Helm quit the Hawks in November 1965 and drifted around the South , at one point working on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico . The tour culminated in a famously raucous concert in Manchester , England , in May 1966 when an audience member shouted " Judas ! " at Dylan for allegedly betraying the cause of politically progressive folk music . Returning exhausted from the hectic schedule of his world tour , Dylan discovered that his manager , Albert Grossman , had arranged a further 63 concerts across the US that year . 
 = = = Motorcycle crash = = = 
 On July 29 , 1966 , Dylan crashed his Triumph motorcycle near his home in Woodstock , New York , suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion . The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled . Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash : " A quarter of a century on , Dylan 's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career . As a sudden , abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode . The great irony is that 1967 — the year after the accident — remains his most prolific year as a songwriter . " In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner , Dylan said , " I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me away for a while , and I still didn 't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after that . I realized that it was a real accident . I mean I thought that I was just gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before ... but I couldn 't do it anymore . " 
 Dylan was rethinking the direction of his life while recovering from a sense of having been exploited . Nine months after the crash , he told New York Daily News reporter Michael <unk> , " Songs are in my head like they always are . And they 're not going to get written down until some things are evened up . Not until some people come forth and make up for some of the things that have happened . " After discussing the crash with Dylan , biographer Robert Shelton concluded that he " was saying there must be another way of life for the pop star , in which he is in control , not they . He had to find ways of working to his own advantage with the recording industry . He had to come to terms with his one @-@ time friend , longtime manager , part @-@ time neighbor , and sometime landlord , Albert Grossman . "

 Rick Danko recalled that he , Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson joined Robbie Robertson in West Saugerties , a few miles from Woodstock , in February 1967 . The three of them moved into a house on Stoll Road nicknamed " Big Pink " ; Robertson lived nearby with his future wife , Dominique . Danko and Manuel had been invited to Woodstock to collaborate with Dylan on a film he was editing , Eat the Document , a rarely seen account of Dylan 's 1966 world tour . At some point between March and June 1967 , Dylan and the four Hawks began a series of informal recording sessions , initially at the so @-@ called Red Room of Dylan 's house , Hi Lo Ha , in the Byrdcliffe area of Woodstock . In June , the recording sessions moved to the basement of Big Pink . Hudson set up a recording unit , using two stereo mixers and a tape recorder borrowed from Grossman , as well as a set of microphones on loan from folk trio Peter , Paul and Mary . Dylan would later tell Jann Wenner , " That 's really the way to do a recording — in a peaceful , relaxed setting — in somebody 's basement . With the windows open ... and a dog lying on the floor . " 
 For the first couple of months , they were merely " killing time " , according to Robertson , with many early sessions devoted to covers . " With the covers Bob was educating us a little " , recalls Robertson . " The whole folkie thing was still very questionable to us — it wasn 't the train we came in on . ... He 'd come up with something like ' Royal Canal ' , and you 'd say , ' This is so beautiful ! The expression ! ' ... He remembered too much , remembered too many songs too well . He 'd come over to Big Pink , or wherever we were , and pull out some old song — and he 'd prepped for this . He 'd practiced this , and then come out here , to show us . " Songs recorded at the early sessions included material written or made popular by Johnny Cash , Ian & Sylvia , John Lee Hooker , Hank Williams and Eric Von Schmidt , as well as traditional songs and standards . Linking all the recordings , both new material and old , is the way in which Dylan re @-@ engaged with traditional American music . Biographer Barney Hoskyns observed that both the seclusion of Woodstock and the discipline and sense of tradition in the Hawks ' musicianship were just what Dylan needed after the " globe @-@ trotting psychosis " of the 1965 – 66 tour . 
 = = = New compositions = = = 
 Dylan began to write and record new material at the sessions . According to Hudson , " We were doing seven , eight , ten , sometimes fifteen songs a day . Some were old ballads and traditional songs ... but others Bob would make up as he went along . ... We 'd play the melody , he 'd sing a few words he 'd written , and then make up some more , or else just mouth sounds or even syllables as he went along . It 's a pretty good way to write songs . " Danko told Dylan biographer Howard Sounes , " Bob and Robbie , they would come by every day , five to seven days a week , for seven to eight months . " Hudson added , " It amazed me , Bob 's writing ability . How he would come in , sit down at the typewriter , and write a song . And what was amazing was that almost every one of those songs was funny . " 
 Dylan recorded around thirty new compositions with the Hawks , including some of the most celebrated songs of his career : " I Shall Be Released " , " This Wheel 's on Fire " , " Quinn the Eskimo ( The Mighty Quinn ) " , " Tears of Rage " and " You Ain 't Goin ' Nowhere " . Two of these featured his lyrics set to music by members of the Band : Danko wrote the music of " This Wheel 's on Fire " ; Manuel , who composed " Tears of Rage " , described how Dylan " came down to the basement with a piece of typewritten paper ... and he just said , ' Have you got any music for this ? ' ... I had a couple of musical movements that fit ... so I just elaborated a bit , because I wasn 't sure what the lyrics meant . I couldn 't run upstairs and say , ' What 's this mean , Bob : " Now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse " ? ' " 
 One of the qualities of The Basement Tapes that sets it apart from contemporaneous works is its simple , down @-@ to @-@ earth sound . The songs were recorded in mid @-@ 1967 , the " Summer of Love " that produced the Beatles ' Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , their most technically elaborate album . In a 1978 interview , Dylan reflected on the period : " I didn 't know how to record the way other people were recording , and I didn 't want to . The Beatles had just released Sgt. Pepper which I didn 't like at all . I thought that was a very indulgent album , though the songs on it were real good . I didn 't think all that production was necessary . " Of the sound and atmosphere of the basement recordings , Barney Hoskyns wrote that " Big Pink itself determined the nature of this homemade brew . " " One of the things is that if you played loud in the basement , it was really annoying , because it was a cement @-@ walled room " , recalled Robertson . " So we played in a little huddle : if you couldn 't hear the singing , you were playing too loud . " 
 Mike Marqusee describes how the basement recordings represented a radical change of direction for Dylan , who turned his back on his reputation for importing avant @-@ garde ideas into popular culture : " At the very moment when avant @-@ gardism was sweeping through new cultural corridors , Dylan decided to dismount . The dandified , aggressively modern surface was replaced by a self @-@ consciously unassuming and traditional garb . The giddiness embodied , celebrated , dissected in the songs of the mid @-@ sixties had left him exhausted . He sought safety in a retreat to the countryside that was also a retreat in time , or more precisely , a search for timelessness . " 
 Dylan had married Sara Lownds in November 1965 . By the time the basement sessions started in Big Pink around June 1967 , he had two children : Maria ( Sara 's daughter from her first marriage ) and Jesse Dylan . Anna Dylan was born on July 11 , 1967 . Both Heylin and biographer Sid Griffin suggest that recording had to move from Dylan 's home to Big Pink when it became clear that the sessions were getting in the way of family life . <unk> was the context of The Basement Tapes , as Hudson said in The Last Waltz : " Chopping wood and hitting your thumb with a hammer , fixing the tape recorder or the screen door , wandering off into the woods with Hamlet [ the dog Dylan shared with the Band ] ... it was relaxed and low @-@ key , which was something we hadn 't enjoyed since we were children . " Several Basement Tapes songs , such as " Clothes Line Saga " and " Apple Suckling Tree " , celebrate the domestic aspects of the rural lifestyle . 
 The intense collaboration between Dylan and the Hawks that produced the basement recordings came to an end in October 1967 when Dylan relocated to Nashville to record a formal studio album , John Wesley Harding , with a different crew of accompanying musicians . The same month , drummer Levon Helm rejoined his former bandmates in Woodstock , after he received a phone call from Danko informing him that they were getting ready to record as a group . In his autobiography , Helm recalled how he listened to the recordings the Hawks had made with Dylan , and remembered that he " could tell that hanging out with the boys had helped Bob to find a connection with things we were interested in : blues , rockabilly , R & B. They had rubbed off on him a little . " 
 = = Dwarf Music demos and Great White Wonder = = 
 Dylan referred to commercial pressures behind the basement recordings in a 1969 interview with Rolling Stone : " They weren 't demos for myself , they were demos of the songs . I was being <unk> again into coming up with some songs . You know how those things go . " In October 1967 , a fourteen @-@ song demo tape was copyrighted and the compositions were registered with Dwarf Music , a publishing company jointly owned by Dylan and Grossman . <unk> and tapes of the songs then circulated among interested recording artists . 
 Peter , Paul and Mary , managed by Grossman , had the first hit with a basement composition when their cover of " Too Much of Nothing " reached number 35 on the Billboard chart in late 1967 . Ian & Sylvia , also managed by Grossman , recorded " Tears of Rage " , " Quinn the Eskimo " and " This Wheel 's on Fire " . In January 1968 , Manfred Mann reached number one on the UK pop chart with their recording of " The Mighty Quinn " . In April , " This Wheel 's on Fire " , recorded by Julie Driscoll , Brian Auger and the Trinity , hit number five on the UK chart . That same month , a version of " You Ain 't Goin ' Nowhere " by the Byrds was issued as a single . Along with " Nothing Was Delivered " , it appeared on their country @-@ rock album Sweetheart of the Rodeo , released in August . The Hawks , officially renamed the Band , recorded " This Wheel 's on Fire " , " I Shall Be Released " and " Tears of Rage " for their debut album , Music from Big Pink , released in July 1968 . Fairport Convention covered " Million Dollar Bash " on their 1969 album Unhalfbricking . 
 As tapes of Dylan 's recordings circulated in the music industry , journalists became aware of their existence . In June 1968 , Jann Wenner wrote a front @-@ page Rolling Stone story headlined " Dylan 's Basement Tape Should Be Released " . Wenner listened to the fourteen @-@ song demo and reported , " There is enough material — most all of it very good — to make an entirely new Bob Dylan album , a record with a distinct style of its own . " He concluded , " Even though Dylan used one of the finest rock and roll bands ever assembled on the Highway 61 album , here he works with his own band for the first time . Dylan brings that instinctual feel for rock and roll to his voice for the first time . If this were ever to be released it would be a classic . " 
 Reporting such as this whetted the appetites of Dylan fans . In July 1969 , the first rock bootleg appeared in California , entitled Great White Wonder . The double album consisted of seven songs from the Woodstock basement sessions , plus some early recordings Dylan had made in Minneapolis in December 1961 and one track recorded from The Johnny Cash Show . One of those responsible for the bootleg , identified only as Patrick , talked to Rolling Stone : " Dylan is a heavy talent and he 's got all those songs nobody 's ever heard . We thought we 'd take it upon ourselves to make this music available . " The process of bootlegging Dylan 's work would eventually see the illegal release of hundreds of live and studio recordings , and lead the Recording Industry Association of America to describe Dylan as the most bootlegged artist in the history of the music industry . 
 = = Columbia Records compilation = = 
 In January 1975 , Dylan unexpectedly gave permission for the release of a selection of the basement recordings , perhaps because he and Grossman had resolved their legal dispute over the Dwarf Music copyrights on his songs . Clinton Heylin argues that Dylan was able to consent following the critical and commercial success of his album Blood on the Tracks , released that same month : " After Blood on the Tracks , The Basement Tapes no longer had the status of a final reminder of Dylan 's lost genius " . In 1975 , as well , the Band purchased Shangri @-@ La ranch in Malibu , California , which they transformed into their recording studio . 
 Engineer Rob Fraboni was brought to Shangri @-@ La to clean up the recordings still in the possession of Hudson , the original engineer . Fraboni had worked on Dylan 's Planet Waves album , with backing by the Band , and the live Dylan – Band album Before the Flood , both released in 1974 . Fraboni has described Robertson as the dominant voice in selecting the final tracks for The Basement Tapes and reported that Dylan was not in the studio very often . The stereo recordings made by Hudson were remixed to mono , while Robertson and other members of the Band overdubbed new keyboard , guitar , and drum parts onto some of the 1967 Woodstock recordings . According to Fraboni , four new songs by the Band were also recorded in preparation for the album 's official release , one of which , a cover of Chuck Berry 's " Going Back to Memphis " , did not end up being included . There is disagreement about the recording date of the other three songs : " Bessie Smith " , " Ain 't No More Cane " and " Don 't Ya Tell Henry " . While Fraboni has recalled that the Band taped them in 1975 , the liner notes for the reissued versions of the Band 's own albums state that these songs were recorded between 1967 and 1970 . Ultimately , eight of the twenty @-@ four songs on The Basement Tapes did not feature Dylan , several of them studio outtakes <unk> the sessions at Big Pink . In justifying their inclusion , Robertson explained that he , Hudson and Dylan did not have access to all the basement recordings : " We had access to some of the songs . Some of these things came under the heading of ' homemade ' which meant a Basement Tape to us . " Robertson has suggested that the Basement Tapes are , for him , " a process , a homemade feel " and so could include recordings from a wide variety of sources .

 The art director / design consultant credited on the 1975 album was Bob Cato . The cover photograph for the 1975 album was taken by designer and photographer Reid Miles in the basement of a Los Angeles YMCA . It poses Dylan and the Band alongside characters suggested by the songs : a woman in a Mrs. Henry T @-@ shirt , an Eskimo , a circus strongman and a dwarf who has been identified as Angelo <unk> . Robertson wears a blue Mao @-@ style suit , and Manuel wears an RAF flight lieutenant uniform . Michael Gray has identified musicians David Blue and Neil Young in the photograph . The identification of Young has been disputed by Bill Scheele who has written that Young was not present . Bill Scheele and his brother John Scheele worked with The Band from 1969 until 1976 and were present in the cover photo .

 Columbia Records released The Basement Tapes on June 26 , 1975 . The album peaked at number seven on the Billboard chart , and reached number eight in the UK . It was acclaimed by critics . John Rockwell of The New York Times hailed it as " one of the greatest albums in the history of American popular music . " Rolling Stone 's Paul Nelson called its contents " the hardest , toughest , sweetest , saddest , funniest , wisest songs I know " . Robert Christgau gave it an A + in his Village Voice " Consumer Guide " column . He commented on how the recordings sounded richer and stranger in 1975 than when they were made and concluded , " We don 't have to bow our heads in shame because this is the best album of 1975 . It would have been the best album of 1967 , too . " The Basement Tapes topped the Voice 's Pazz & Jop Critics Poll . The review in The Washington Post declared , " He may perplex , irritate , and disappoint , but Dylan has to rank as the single greatest artist modern American pop music has produced . " 
 = = Criticism of 1975 album = = 
 Criticism of the 1975 official release of The Basement Tapes has centered on two issues : the recordings by the Band on their own , and the selection of the Dylan songs . In his book about the basement sessions , Greil Marcus describes the album 's contents as " sixteen basement recordings plus eight Band demos " . Critic Michael Gray writes of the album , " The interspersed tracks by the Band alone merely disrupt the unity of Dylan material , much more of which should have been included . Key songs missing here include ' I Shall Be Released ' and ' The Mighty Quinn ' " . Heylin similarly argues that compiler Robbie Robertson did Dylan fans " a major disservice " by omitting those two songs as well as " I 'm Not There " and " Sign On The Cross " . He writes , " The album as released hardly gave a real idea of what they had been doing in Woodstock . Not even the two traditional songs pulled to the master reels — ' Young But Daily <unk> ' ' and ' The Banks Of The Royal Canal ' — made the final twenty @-@ four cuts . " 
 The authenticity of the 1975 album was questioned by a reviewer of the remastered version of the Band 's Music from Big Pink , issued in 2000 . Dave Hopkins noted that " Katie 's Been Gone " , which appears as a bonus track on the Big Pink reissue , is the same recording that appeared on The Basement Tapes , but now " in stereo and with improved sound quality beyond what the remastering process alone would provide " . Hopkins declared , " The cat 's out of the bag : ' Katie ' and the other Band @-@ only tracks on The Basement Tapes must have been intentionally muddied in the studio in 1975 so that they would fit better alongside the Dylan material recorded in the basement with a home reel @-@ to @-@ reel . " Heylin also takes exception to Robertson 's passing off the Band 's songs as originating from the basement sessions . By including eight Band recordings to Dylan 's sixteen , he says , " Robertson sought to imply that the alliance between Dylan and the Band was far more equal than it was : ' Hey , we were writing all these songs , doing our own thing , oh and Bob would sometimes come around and we 'd swap a few tunes . ' " Heylin asserts that " though revealing in their own right , the Band tracks only pollute the official set and reduce its stature . " 
 Barney Hoskyns describes " Heylin 's objections [ as ] the academic ones of a touchy <unk> : The Basement Tapes still contained some of the greatest music either Dylan or the Band ever recorded . " Sid Griffin similarly defends the inclusion of the Band 's songs : " ' Ain 't No More Cane ' may be included under false pretenses , but it is stirring stuff . ... And while a Dylan fan might understandably grumble that he wanted to hear another Bob song , a fan equally versed and interested more generally in late 20th century American music would only smile and thank the Good Lord for the gift of this song . " Of the Band 's version of " Don 't Ya Tell Henry " , he writes , " True , the argument could be made that Robertson was way outside his brief in including this on the two @-@ LP set , as this wasn 't from Woodstock or ' 67 , and has no Dylan on it . ... But it is a song from the Basement Tapes era and it swings like a randy sailor on shore leave in a bisexual bar . So give Robbie a break . " 
 By 1975 , Dylan showed scant interest in the <unk> minutiae of the recordings . Interviewed on the radio by Mary Travers , he recalled , " We were all up there sorta drying out ... making music and watching time go by . So , in the meantime , we made this record . Actually , it wasn 't a record , it was just songs which we 'd come to this basement and recorded . Out in the woods ... " Heylin has commented that Dylan seemed to " dismiss the work as unfinished therapy " . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Although The Basement Tapes reached the public in an unorthodox manner , officially released eight years after the songs were recorded , critics have assigned them an important place in Dylan 's development . Michael Gray writes , " The core Dylan songs from these sessions actually do form a clear link between ... two utterly different albums . They evince the same highly serious , precarious quest for a personal and universal salvation which marked out the John Wesley Harding collection — yet they are soaked in the same blocked confusion and turmoil as Blonde on Blonde . ' Tears of Rage ' , for example , is an exact halfway house between , say , ' One of Us Must Know ( Sooner or Later ) ' and ' I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine ' " . 
 Singer @-@ songwriter David Gray commented that the great achievement of The Basement Tapes is that Dylan found a way out of the anguish and verbal complexity that had characterized his mid @-@ sixties albums such as Blonde on Blonde : " It 's the sound of Dylan letting his guard down . ' Clothes Line Saga ' and all those ridiculous songs , he 's obviously just making it all up , they were having such a great time . The sound of the Band is so antiquated like something out of the Gold Rush and Dylan fits in because he 's this storyteller with an ancient heart . At the time everything he did was so scrutinised , yet somehow he liberated himself from all that and enjoyed making music again . You hear an unselfconscious quality on this record which you don 't ever hear again . " " He mocks his own inertia and impotence " , writes critic Mike Marqusee , " but with a much gentler touch than in Blonde on Blonde . In place of that album 's strangled urgency , Dylan adopts a laconic humor , a deadpan tone that speaks of resignation and self @-@ preservation in the face of absurdity and betrayal . " 
 Robert Shelton has argued that The Basement Tapes revolves around two sets of themes . One group of songs is " <unk> with the search for salvation " : " I Shall Be Released " ( on the demo , but not on the album ) , " Too Much of Nothing " , " Nothing Was Delivered " , " This Wheel 's On Fire " , " Tears of Rage " and " Goin ' To Acapulco " . " ' Nothing ' and ' nowhere ' perplex and nag " in these songs , he writes . " The ' nothing ' echoes the artist 's dilemma : death versus life , vacuum versus harvest , isolation versus people , silence versus sound , the void versus the life @-@ impulse . " A second group , comprising " songs of joy , signaling some form of deliverance " , includes most of the remaining songs in the collection . 
 In his sleeve notes for the 1975 release of The Basement Tapes , Greil Marcus wrote , " What was taking place as Dylan and the Band <unk> with the tunes , was less a style than a spirit — a spirit that had to do with a delight in friendship and invention . " He compared the songs to fabled works of American music : " The Basement tapes are a testing and a discovery of roots and memory ... they are no more likely to fade than Elvis Presley 's ' Mystery Train ' or Robert Johnson 's ' Love In Vain . ' " 
 In 1997 , after listening to more than 100 basement recordings issued on various bootlegs , Marcus extended these insights into a book @-@ length study , Invisible Republic ( reissued in 2001 under the title The Old , Weird America ) . In it , he quotes Robertson 's memory of the recording : " [ Dylan ] would pull these songs out of nowhere . We didn 't know if he wrote them or if he remembered them . When he sang them , you couldn 't tell . " Marcus calls the songs " <unk> with a community of ghosts . ... These ghosts were not abstractions . As native sons and daughters they were a community . And they were once gathered in a single place : on the Anthology of American Folk Music " . A collection of blues and country music recorded in the 1920s and 1930s , the Anthology — compiled by Harry Smith and originally released by Folkways Records in 1952 — was a major influence on the folk music revival of the 1950s and the 1960s . Marcus suggests that Dylan 's Basement Tapes shared with Smith 's Anthology a sense of alchemy , " and in the alchemy is an undiscovered country " .

 While removed from the public 's gaze , Dylan and the Band made music very different from the recordings of other major artists . Andy Gill writes , " Musically , the songs were completely at odds with what was going on in the rest of the pop world , which during the long hot summer of 1967 was celebrating the birth of the hippie movement with a gaudy explosion of ' psychedelic ' music — mostly facile paeans to universal love draped in interminable guitar solos . " Patrick Humphries <unk> the ways in which Dylan 's songs dissented from the dominant ethos of rock culture : " While the rock world vented its spleen on parents and leaders , Dylan was singing privately about parental fidelity . While George Harrison was testifying that life went on within and without you , Dylan was taking his potatoes down to be mashed . While Mick Jagger was 2 @,@ 000 light years from home , Dylan was strapping himself to a tree with roots . " 
 This aspect of the basement recordings became obvious when Dylan chose to record his next album , John Wesley Harding , in Nashville in late 1967 . The songs on that record , according to Howard Sounes , revealed the influence of Dylan 's daily reading of both the Bible and the Hank Williams songbook . And its sound came as a shock to other rock musicians . As producer Bob Johnston recalled , " Every artist in the world was in the studio trying to make the biggest @-@ sounding record they possibly could . So what does [ Dylan ] do ? He comes to Nashville and tells me he wants to record with a bass , drum and guitar . " Dylan summed up the gap : " At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we were singing these homespun ballads . " 
 When the Band began work on their debut album , Music from Big Pink , in a New York studio in January 1968 , they employed a recording technique similar to the one they had become familiar with during the Basement Tapes sessions . As Robertson described it , " We used the same kind of mike on everything . A bit of an anti @-@ studio approach . And we realized what was comfortable to us was turning wherever we were into a studio . Like the Big Pink technique . " That technique influenced groups including the Beatles , writes Griffin , who calls their Twickenham Get Back sessions in early 1969 an effort to record " in the honest , live , no frills , no overdubs , down home way that the Hawks / Band did for the Basement Tapes " . 
 " Listening to The Basement Tapes now , it seems to be the beginning of what is called Americana or <unk> , " wrote Billy Bragg . " The thing about <unk> which makes it ' alt ' is that it is not polished . It is not rehearsed or slick . Neither are The Basement Tapes . Remember that The Basement Tapes holds a certain cultural weight which is timeless — and the best Americana does that as well . " The songs ' influence has been detected by critics in many subsequent acts . Stuart Bailie wrote , " If rock 'n'roll is the sound of a party in session , the Basement Tapes were the morning after : bleary , and a bit rueful but dashed with emotional potency . Countless acts — Mercury Rev , Cowboy Junkies , Wilco , the Waterboys — have since tried to get back to that place . " 
 For Elvis Costello , The Basement Tapes " sound like they were made in a cardboard box . I think [ Dylan ] was trying to write songs that sounded like he 'd just found them under a stone . As if they sound like real folk songs — because if you go back into the folk tradition , you will find songs as dark and as deep as these . " 
 In 2016 , Rolling Stone magazine ranked The Basement Tapes number 292 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time . In a special issue devoted to Dylan 's work , Q magazine awarded the record five stars , its highest rating , commenting that " Dylan 's work is by turns haunting , hilarious and puzzling — and all of it taps into centuries of American song " .

 On March 31 , 2009 , Legacy Records issued a remastered version of the original 1975 Basement Tapes double album , which critics praised for its improved sound quality . According to reviewer Scott Hreha , there was " something about the remastering that makes it feel more like an official album — the earlier CD version ’ s weak fidelity unfairly emphasized the ' basement ' nature of the recordings , where it now possesses a clarity that belies its humble and informal origins .

 = Meat ant = 
 The meat ant ( Iridomyrmex purpureus ) , also known as the gravel ant or southern meat ant , is a species of ant endemic to Australia . A member of the genus Iridomyrmex in the subfamily Dolichoderinae , it was described by British entomologist Frederick Smith in 1858 . The meat ant is associated with many common names due to its appearance , nest @-@ building behaviour and abundance , of which its specific name , purpureus , refers to its coloured appearance . It is among the best @-@ known species of ant found throughout Australia ; it occurs in almost all states and territories except for Tasmania . Its enormous distribution , aggression and ecological importance have made this ant a dominant species . 
 The meat ant is monomorphic ( occurs in a particular form ) , although there is evidence that certain populations can be polymorphic . It is characterised by its dark @-@ bluish body and red head . It is a medium to large species , measuring 6 – 12 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 – 0 @.@ 47 in ) . The workers and males are approximately the same sizes at 6 – 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 – 0 @.@ 28 in ) and 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) , respectively . The queens are the largest and appear mostly black , measuring 12 @.@ 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 50 in ) . The iridescence in workers ranges from green or blue to plain green and purple , varying in different body parts and castes . Meat ants inhabit open and warm areas in large , oval @-@ shaped mounds that are accompanied by many entrance holes . The nest area is always cleared of vegetation and covered with materials including gravel , pebbles and dead vegetation . They are also polydomous , where a colony may be established in a series of satellite nests connected by well @-@ defined paths and trails . Satellite nests are constructed away from the main nest and nearby areas with valuable food sources so workers can exploit them . 
 Queens mate with a single male and colonies may have more than one queen until the workers arrive , where they both exhibit antagonism . It takes around one or two months for an individual egg to develop into an adult . Colonies range in size , varying between 11 @,@ 000 individuals to over 300 @,@ 000 . The meat ant is a diurnal species ( active throughout most of the day ) , especially when it is warm . It forages on trees and collect sweet substances such as honeydew and nectar , and also capture insects or collect the remains of animals . A number of predators eat these ants , including the short @-@ beaked echidna ( Tachyglossus aculeatus ) , numerous species of birds , blindsnakes and spiders . This species is also a competitor of the banded sugar ant ( Camponotus consobrinus ) . Meat ants establish territorial borders with neighbouring colonies and solve disputes through ritualised fighting . 
 Meat ants play an important role in both the environment and for humans . A single nest is capable of dispersing over 300 @,@ 000 plant seeds ; moreover , meat ants have formed symbiotic relationships with many insects . This ant may be used as a form of pest control to kill the cane toad , an invasive species . They can also help farmers to remove animal carcases by consuming and reducing them to bones in a matter of weeks . Despite this , meat ants are sometimes pests around urban areas and eradicating them is difficult . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The meat ant was first described in 1858 by British entomologist Frederick Smith in his Catalogue of <unk> Insects in the Collection of the British Museum part VI , under the binomial name Formica purpurea from a holotype worker ant he collected in Melbourne , Victoria . The type material is currently housed in the Natural History Museum , London . In 1862 , Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr erected the genus Iridomyrmex , and reclassified the meat ant as a member of Iridomyrmex rather than the genus Formica . The ant was named Iridomyrmex purpurea in 1862 ; however , Mayr renamed the ant as Iridomyrmex purpureus one year after . I. purpureus was later classified as a synonym of Iridomyrmex detectus , and this taxon was designated as the type species of Iridomyrmex in 1903 . In 1993 , I. detectus was synonymised with I. purpureus and grouped into the I. purpureus species complex . I. detectus was described as a separate species by Smith the same year as I. purpureus from two syntype queens he collected from the Hunter River in New South Wales . Although the name I. purpureus was used by many authors , Karl Wilhelm von Dalla Torre reused I. detectus and this was adopted by several authors , replacing I. purpureus . By the 1960s , however , I. purpureus once again became preferred over I. detectus . While the two names were described in the same year and publication , the name I. purpureus is the valid name for the species in accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature . Entomologist B.T. <unk> was the first person to revise I. purpureus and I. detectus , and he synonymised the two species . 
 Several synonyms have either been classified as a separate species from the meat ant or even a subspecies . Iridomyrmex purpureus sanguineus and I. p. viridiaeneus were classified as subspecies in 1974 , previously being recognised as two species . I. detectus castrae was originally described as a variant of the meat ant in 1925 ( as I. d. var. castrae ) , but the taxon was reclassified as a subspecies in 1985 ; subsequently , a 1993 revision reclassified I. p. sanguineus and I. p. viridiaeneus at species level while I. d. castrae was synonymised , based on morphological examinations of collected material . Camponotus horni , Formica smithii and <unk> <unk> were described as three distinct species in three different ant genera , but these classifications were short @-@ lived , as scientists discovered that these taxa were all identical , and subsequently synonymised them with the meat ant . Camponotus horni was described by English entomologist William Forsell Kirby in 1896 from worker and queen syntypes he collected at Palm Creek in the Northern Territory . In 1930 , Australian entomologist John S. Clark reviewed these specimens and synonymised the taxon with the meat ant . However , the queen was later found to be distinct from the workers and C. horni was redescribed as a species . The information provided by Clark makes it sufficient to retain the validity of the name , making Clark the new author of C. horni . Due to the uncertain taxonomic status of Clark 's C. horni , a proposal to rename the species cannot be carried through . Clark 's C. horni is currently a junior homonym for Kirby 's C. horni . 
 One synonym , Iridomyrmex greensladei , was described as a separate species from the meat ant based on the anatomical differences of its head and pronotum ( the dorsal portion of the prothorax 's exoskeletal plates ) , which are the same colour as its mesosoma . In the meat ant , the head and pronotum are usually lighter than the mesosoma . American entomologist Steve Shattuck notes that the two ants are non @-@ sympatric ( they exist in the same geographic area and regularly encounter each other ) , and supporting evidence to separate them as two distinct species emerged when the enzymes esterase and amylase were examined and the results show that they had different amylase allele . These examinations , however , did not take any account of any distinction in colour between populations previously known as I. greensladei and I. purpureus . For example , colonies residing in Western Australia may have lighter heads whereas those living in the eastern states have darker heads . An unpublished study examining the mitochondrial DNA did not find any distinction between eastern and western populations of I. greensladei and I. purpureus . Additional evidence suggests that the populations found in the east and west are the same species . Despite this evidence , there are several problems : forms intended to be I. greensladei were found in the Yorke Peninsula by a 1987 study , which noted that while the ants were morphologically indistinguishable from both I. greensladei and I. purpureus populations , their nests only contained a single nest hole ( whereas I. purpureus nests have many ) . Shattuck also collected workers for his holotype and paratype specimens from Israelite Bay in Western Australia , rather than collecting those from Yorke Peninsula . The forms in Yorke Peninsula have also never been subject to study , so future research may shed light as to whether or not these ants are genetically different from the meat ant . 
 Under the present classification , the meat ant is a member of the genus Iridomyrmex in the tribe <unk> , subfamily Dolichoderinae . It is a member of the family Formicidae , belonging to the order Hymenoptera , an order of insects containing ants , bees , and wasps . The genus <unk> is the sister group of Iridomyrmex , both of which are in a clade that is 23 million years old . Fossils related to the meat ant and other species are from the Eocene and Oligocene . 
 = = = Forms = = = 
 In the early 1970s , scientists discovered several different forms of meats ants , forming the Iridomyrmex purpureus species group ; three forms were identified ( the regular I. purpureus and the other two forms I. sanguineus and I. viridiaeneus ) , differing in colour and nest structure . However , as there were no clear morphological differences among these variations , the taxonomic status and evolutionary relationship of these ants remained uncertain . Colouration varies from ants with a red head and thorax and a blue metallic sheen , to those with a yellowish body and a bluish @-@ purple gaster . Others may be darker , appearing metallic @-@ bluish to purplish @-@ black . Owing to their different geographical ranges , the behaviour and ecology of these forms differentiated , based on examinations where multiple forms were sympatric . Each form had its own geographical limit , although the regular I. purpureus form is very common , inhabiting at least one @-@ third of the Australian continent . Some forms may be dominant in certain habitats ; for example , one form may be widespread throughout moist environments in dry areas , and others in cool and dry areas . 
 In 1974 , I. sanguineus and I. viridiaeneus were classified as two subspecies of the meat ant by P.J. Greenslade . He also recognised another form , an undescribed blue form that was first studied several years earlier . Greenslade did not propose any taxonomic recognition of the newly discovered taxon , but instead referred to it as a " form " . In 1975 , a study examined the distinctiveness of three forms by comparing the amylase enzyme allele frequencies . The blue form was found to be genetically isolated and its allele frequencies differed significantly from the forms purpureus and viridiaeneus , but the same study concluded that these latter two forms were similar . During this time , Greenslade would continue to study these forms to include a dark yellow , yellow , orange and a small purple form . In addition , two new forms were recognised in later studies , but these two forms were not given any formal species description . Instead , they were only recognised by their colour and the genitalia of the males . Although these forms most likely represented undescribed , yet distinct species , the I. purpureus species group only contained a single valid species , three subspecies and seven different forms . In 1993 , all known forms and subspecies were either revived or classified at species level in an article revising the group , concluding the separation of the forms from each other . 
 = = = Etymology and common names = = = 
 The specific epithet of the meat ant , purpureus , derives from Latin , in which it means " purple " , " purple @-@ coloured " or " dark @-@ red " , referencing the coloured appearance of the ant . In classical Latin , purpureus primarily translated to " dyed purple " , while the word purpura , used by Smith for the meat ant ( Formica purpura ) , translates to " <unk> @-@ dyed cloth " . The generic name , Iridomyrmex , translates to " rainbow ants " from Ancient Greek , another reference which points to its appearance ; this , in particular , is due to its blue @-@ green iridescence colour . It is a compound of two Ancient Greek words – <unk> , meaning " rainbow " , and myrmex , that means " ant " . The ant is commonly known as the meat ant because of its habit of stripping the meat off dead vertebrates . Alternative names include the gravel ant , Greenslade 's meat ant , meat @-@ eater ant , mound ant , or southern meat ant . The name " southern meat ant " is due to its extreme abundance in the southern regions of Australia . 
 = = Description = = 
 In general , meat ants are medium to large in size , measuring 6 – 12 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 – 0 @.@ 47 in ) , and can be easily recognised by their dark @-@ bluish body and red head . Generally , their heads and <unk> share similar colours and are lighter than the mesothorax ( the middle of the three segments in the thorax ) and the propodeum ( the first abdominal segment ) , which are reddish brown . However , the head may sometimes be lighter , and the pronotum and mesothorax may share similar colours . The <unk> setae ( as in <unk> found on the mesosoma ) are dark and sometimes translucent . The iridescence between the compound eyes and the lateral portion of the head ranges from slightly purple to strong and dark purple . The colour of the legs and coxae ( the basal segment of the insect leg , which attaches to the body ) are darker than the mesothorax , and the petiole ( narrow waist ) is reddish brown and also darker than the mesothorax . The lateral portion of the second gastral tergite ( a dorsal segment other than the head ) is shiny , and the iridescence varies among workers , from green or blue to plain green and purple . The soft hairs on the head are frequent around the occipital margin , and around the mandibular insertion , three to eight pale setae are usually seen . The soft hairs are also common around the first gastral tergite . Examined specimens show no known ocelli . Erect setae on the pronotum are abundant . The anterodorsal ( meaning in front and toward the back ) portion of the propodeum is arched and flat . 
 There are no allometric differences among workers . On average , workers measure around 6 – 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 – 0 @.@ 28 in ) ; this character distinguishes these ants from queens , as well as the different variety of colours they exhibit on their bodies . The head and pronotum range from orange to brick @-@ red , and the mesonotum and propodeum are either light , same in colour or darker than the head . The gaster can be brown or black with blue or purple iridescence and the legs are either orange or brown . The iridescence around the <unk> is blue , pink , pale greenish yellow and purple . The erect setae are brown . The head has a concave posterior margin ( as in the end of an organism from its head ) with erect setae abundant in front of the face . The sides of the head are convex . Fully erect setae on the genal ( side region of the head ) are either present or absent , although a small number of setae may be seen around the mandibular insertion . The eyes are semicircular and positioned around the midpoint of the ants ' head capsule . The frontal carinae ( a keel @-@ shaped ridge or structure ) are convex and the antennal scapes extend beyond the head 's posterior margin by two or three times the diameter . Erect setae are found all over the antennal scape and noticeably prominent on the clypeal margin ( a shield @-@ like plate at the front of an insect ) . The mandibles are elongated and triangular , with long curved setae around the head capsule . The pronotum is evenly curved with at least 12 or more <unk> setae present . These setae are mostly short and bristly . The mesonotum is sinuous ( meaning it has many curves ) , and , like the pronotum , has 12 or more <unk> setae . The <unk> spiracles are very small and the propodeal dorsum is smooth or convex . There are also a number of propodeal setae . The dorsum of the node ( a segment between the mesosoma and gaster ) is thin , scale @-@ like and sometimes vertical . There are both non @-@ marginal and marginal setae present on the first gastral tergite around the gaster . 
 Queens are easily distinguishable from workers by their black colour and larger size , measuring 12 @.@ 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 50 in ) . Queens are black and fuscous , being mostly dark and sombre . The antennae and legs are ferruginous ( rust @-@ like colour ) , the head is <unk> @-@ ferruginous , and the sides beneath the face and mandibles are ferruginous . The head is wider than the thorax and emarginate . There is an impressed line that runs from the anterior ( nearer to the front of the body ) stemma to the base of the clypeus . The thorax is ovate ( has an oval @-@ shaped outline ) and thinly covered with short reddish brown pubescence ( soft short hair ) . The wings are <unk> , exhibiting a glassy appearance . The wings are yellowish along the anterior margin of the superior pair and also around the base ; the <unk> ( the veins of the wings ) are rufo @-@ fuscous . Like the thorax , the abdomen is ovate and several abdominal segments appear rufo @-@ <unk> , making it reddish @-@ brown or glossy brownish black . Males are smaller than queens , measuring 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) . Males are bright violet , and the antennae ( except for the first joint ) and tarsi are ferruginous . The first pair of the legs look almost ferruginous , and the head , legs and thorax are covered with black pubescence . Like the queen , the wings are <unk> ( imperfectly hyaline ) and the <unk> are rufo @-@ fuscous . The abdomen shows a bright green tinge when seen under certain light . 
 Larvae measure 2 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 9 mm ( 0 @.@ 11 – 0 @.@ 11 in ) . The body is stout @-@ shaped and the dorsal side is longer whereas the ventral side ( the bottom portion of the body ) is shorter and more straight . The head and anus are ventral . The integument is covered in spinules that are either isolated from each other or in short rows on the posterior somite and on the ventral surface . The body hairs are very short , measuring 0 @.@ 008 – 0 @.@ 016 mm ( 0 @.@ 00031 – 0 @.@ <unk> in ) . The cranium on its dorsal side outlines a curve which is smooth , and the spinules are moderately large . These spinules are either isolated or seen in near parallel rows . Several head hairs are present but they are small at 0 @.@ 013 – 0 @.@ 025 mm ( 0 @.@ <unk> – 0 @.@ <unk> in ) in length . The labrum is narrow and <unk> ( consisting of two lobes ) . Each lobe has spinules and three sensilla ( simple sensory receptors ) around the anterior surface . The ventral border only has two sensilla and a number of spinules , and on the posterior surface , there are several rows of spinules and three sensilla . The mandibles have a central apical ( most distal plate or appendage from the body ) tooth which is clearly noticeable and sharp . The maxillae have lobes , and the labial palps ( sensory structures on the labium ) are knob @-@ shaped . 
 Meat ant workers may be confused with those of I. lividus , as the two appear similar and are grouped in the same species complex . I. lividus and the much more localised I. <unk> can be distinguished from other members of the I. purpureus group by the shape of the pronotum . Aside from colour differentiation that was a key morphological character to distinguish I. purpureus and the synonym I. greensladei from each other , some meat ant populations exhibit polymorphism despite being monomorphic ( occurs in a particular form ) ; specifically , body size among meat ants may vary geographically . For example , those that are found in very hot regions tend to be larger , whereas those found in regions of high humidity tend to be smaller than average . Examined workers once referred to as I. greensladei from southwestern Western Australia have erect setae on the genae ( lateral sclerites ) , whereas those studied elsewhere have glabrous genae , meaning that these areas have no hairs . Such patterns are most likely clinal , where several characteristics may gradually differentiate over a geographical area . The colour of the setae throughout the body and the iridescence may vary geographically . For example , populations restricted to the coasts of Western Australia usually have pale setae , compared to most colonies throughout the country , which have the common blackish setae . In 1993 , Shattuck could not separate populations with pale setae when other key diagnostic traits that would separate these populations were not considered . Meat ants from the Western Australian wheatbelt and goldfields show different iridescence ; the iridescence in some collected specimens ranged from pale greenish @-@ blue to yellowish @-@ green , especially around the humeri ( a structure which forms the basal corner of an insect 's wing or wing case ) and frons . The variation of the iridescence is , however , a consistent pattern found in other Iridomyrmex species with little distinction , making it a subtle character . The colour variation is less marked in all collected specimens of I. purpureus , as well as its close relative I. viridiaeneus , which is found in dry regions around the south @-@ western regions . Shattuck further notes that populations found throughout the Northern Territory and South Australia have reduced pubescence on the first gastral tergite , but this is different elsewhere . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The meat ant is one of the best @-@ known species of ant endemic to Australia ; it has an enormous geographical range , covering at least one @-@ third of the continent . Its range spans 4 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 2 @,@ 500 mi ) from east to west , and 3 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 900 mi ) from north to south . This extensive range has allowed the meat ant to form large nesting grounds in areas where no development has occurred , and large amounts of gravel and open space have led to an abundant supply of materials ( i.e. pebbles and dead pieces of vegetation ) used to construct nests . Its isolation has also allowed meat ants to form associations with neighbouring nests of the same species . The ant is particularly dominant and frequently seen across the coastal and inland regions of southeastern Australia . Based on examined material , meat ants are widespread throughout New South Wales , the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria . In Queensland , they are frequently encountered in the eastern regions , whereas their abundance is limited around the north and central parts . The ants are common in the southwestern regions of Western Australia , though not in the north . However , the Division of Entomology of the CSIRO states that the ant 's presence in the state has not been verified . Most specimens collected in South Australia are from the south @-@ east , but some populations are known in the north @-@ west and northeast regions of the state . In the Northern Territory , specimens have been collected in the north and south regions but compared to other jurisdictions the ant is uncommon . No specimens have been collected from Tasmania or any outlying islands surrounding Australia . 
 Meat ants thrive in varied habitats , especially where it is open and warm . These ants are adapted to and thrive in warm climates and areas with constant high temperatures . The meat ant shares its distribution with many other animals and insects , some of which may cause harm to the ant or rival it , such as the banded sugar ant ( Camponotus consobrinus ) . Nests are seen in box @-@ pine scrubs , Callitris forests , dry and wet sclerophyll woodland , eucalypt open woodland , in farm pastures , flat savannah woodland , mallee woodland , heath , mulga , riparian woodland , around roads and cracks in sidewalks , and urban areas such as urban gardens and parkland . Nests are also common in lateritic ridges , granite outcrops and clay formations . Meat ants are able to survive in dry areas if there is a rich supply of water and food resources ( such as honeydew and arthropod prey ) , especially along river banks , station properties and irrigated areas . Meat ants typically occur at altitudes of 5 and 1 @,@ 170 m ( 16 and 3 @,@ 839 ft ) above sea level , though at times they can be found at heights of 915 m ( 3 @,@ 002 ft ) . Those that are found at these altitudes are always associated with Eucalyptus rubida , and colonies situated in eastern New South Wales tend to nest near E. melliodora and E. blakelyi . In the south coast of New South Wales , meat ants are mainly found in heath shrubland , but are absent from heavily timbered slopes and cannot build nests in quartz . Other areas where the ants do not occur include dense pastures , dense bushes , tropical rainforests and treeless areas . For example , the Canberra suburb of Turner was constructed on subterranean clover pasture , which meat ants do not nest around . Their populations would later flourish and nests became numerous around houses after shrubs and trees were planted . 
 = = = Nests = = = 
 Meat ants are well known for their large , oval @-@ shaped nest @-@ mounds ( normally 1 or 2 metres ( 3 @.@ 3 or 6 @.@ 6 ft ) in diameter ) that are encountered in areas of occurrence , and obvious to identify . These nests are often associated with many entrance holes ; most nests have 20 to 35 holes . On the surface on the nest , workers clear the area of vegetation and cover the mound with gravel , but may use other materials that are available , including sand , pebbles dead vegetation , eucalyptus fruits and twig fragments . Nests are built in the sun and hardly in the shade to keep them warm . The ant is a polydomous species , meaning that they live in more than one nest . Some colonies are known to create " super @-@ nests " : workers construct many nests connected through established paths , extending up to 650 metres ( 2 @,@ 130 ft ) in length . In one extreme case , a single colony was found to occupy over 10 hectares ( 25 acres ) of land with 85 individual nests and 1 @,@ 500 entrance holes . While they show no aggression toward to their nest mates , meat ants are aggressive to occupants of different nests within the same colony . <unk> within a colony is typically favoured as it improves access to forage , as workers deliver most of their food to the nest that is closest to any site they forage in . 
 At any size , a meat ant nest always has a possibility of dying out in any year , but the site may be reoccupied by another colony . Hence , nests can be very old as suggested in one study . Some nests may never be reoccupied for unknown reasons . The regrowth of vegetation which shades the nest , soil damage or even a disease may wipe out a colony and leave the nest site completely abandoned . The death of a colony may be obvious when competing colonies increase in population and size by expanding their territories with well @-@ established satellite nests in order exploit the food sources once used by a former colony . Satellite nests may diverge from their parent nests to become independent , as suggested by the antagonism of worker ants from different nests or when others are uninhabitable by insecticide treatment . After the eradication of a nest , satellite nests emerge nearby , and may sever their connections with the parent nest . The separation of a satellite nest is an effective way for a nest to exploit food sources , and a colony with less than 11 entrance holes is recognised as non @-@ mature ( a nest is mature at 12 ) . As most satellite nests have 11 holes and accept a queen of their own , a satellite nest may easily develop maturity in one year . 
 All entrance holes of a given nest lead into a separate set of galleries . Entrance holes tend to be very small with only enough space for a single worker to fit through , but others may be 1 centimetre ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) wide . Beneath the surface , there are widened circular vertical shafts which are 1 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) wide . Below these shafts , the tunnels turn into irregular galleries with paths going outward and downward which form more galleries . Almost all of these galleries are clustered together 15 to 20 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 9 to 7 @.@ 9 in ) beneath the soil , which is extensively reworked by worker ants in the area above the nest . These sets of galleries are isolated from others connecting to neighbouring holes , although some may come close . However , there is no known physical connection . Each gallery has a flat floor , a domed roof and is irregularly oval @-@ shaped . A gallery is typically 1 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) high and 5 to 7 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 to 2 @.@ 8 in ) wide . Below the galleries are a small number of shafts in undisturbed soil with large , yet scattered chambers where the population remains during the winter . In the upper areas of the colony , the galleries and shafts only account for 7 – 10 % of nest space . For example , the galleries of excavated colonies occupy 420 cubic centimetres ( 26 cu in ) whereas the total volume is around 5 @,@ 000 cubic centimetres ( 310 cu in ) . Overall , a nest may dwell extremely deep beneath the soil as excavated nests are as deep as 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) .

 = = = Foraging and dominance = = = 
 A diurnal species ( active mainly during the day ) , the meat ant shows minimal interaction with nocturnal ant species when their territories overlap . The meat ant and other members of the I. purpureus species group are regarded as a dominant group of diurnal species in Australia , as they are highly active , aggressive , and have an enormous geographical range . During the day , the bulk of the workers attend and feed on honeydew secreted by insects that live on the leaves of Eucalyptus trees . These trees are connected by foraging trails formed by meat ants , which also connect to satellite nests that are a part of a single colony ; these trails are easily visible due to the absence of vegetation and lead to important food and water sources . Other workers in smaller numbers will often scavenge around the nest area for dead insects , or other proteinaceous foods to bring back to their colony . Their dominance is clear when meat ants are capable of finding food sources more successfully than most ants , capable of displacing many ants and other insects . Food sources are also discovered more rapidly and greatly reduces the foraging efficiency of other ants , including those of Iridomyrmex . However , some ants such as the green @-@ head ant ( Rhytidoponera metallica ) are not affected by the presence of meat ants and are still successful in finding food sources . As green @-@ head ants are general predators and forage singularly and cannot recruit other nestmates , they are unable to defend food sources from dominant ants . They heavily rely on any food source and the impossibility of successfully defending it from other ants may have led to its peaceful coexistence with dominant species , including meat ants . This means green @-@ head ants avoid conflict with meat ants . Certain <unk> , which are highly competitive , are capable of defending themselves from foraging workers ; the rapid recruitment of nestmates and the use of chemicals for defence allows them to withstand attacks from meat ants . In particular , <unk> ants have been observed occupying baits regardless of the presence or absence of the meat ant . This is not the case with mealworms , but they have moderate success with honey baits . In foraging areas where meat ants are excluded or not present , the number of other ants observed is far greater and activity dramatically increases . However , the presence of meats ants does not affect abundant species , and most of the time it is only Iridomyrmex ants that increase their foraging rate . 
 The impact of meat ants on other species varies , depending on the habitat and type of food source , and the ecological role the ant plays . The deliberate exclusion of meat ants show that not only they can alter the amount of sources available , but the dynamics of resource use on entire outcrops . If present , meat ants rely on rapidly discovering food sources and retain their dominance so other ants cannot collect them , as well as exploitation and interference which helps displace other ants . The habitat meat ants live in may affect their dominance among the fauna . They are less successful in complex habitats and more successful in open areas , allowing workers to forage efficiently ; for example , workers forage around rocks and collect food sources more successfully in contrast to those in vegetation . Meat ants are even more dominant than other I. purpureus species group members in non @-@ complex habitats . Meat ants are normally larger than other Iridomyrmex species and can displace or even kill those trying to compete for food sources . The similar behaviours among meat ants and certain Iridomyrmex species have increased the level of conflict among each other , especially those in open habitats . 
 The rate of movement of workers is associated with temperature , and foraging workers leave the nest after sunrise when the nest is warmed in the early morning . Meat ants emerge and start foraging when temperatures are approximately 14 ° C ( 57 ° F ) , but they are capable of withstanding extremely hot temperatures , as workers have been seen foraging in 43 ° C ( 109 ° F ) heat . Workers may only forage for several minutes when soil temperature is well above their thermal limit at 45 @.@ 8 ° C ( 114 ° F ) . At 50 ° C ( 122 ° F ) ( soil surface temperature ) , foraging activity is reduced even further . As these ants exhibit high running speeds during hot days , their speed decreases after temperatures of 50 ° C due to the physiological stress put onto them . Workers can withstand such temperatures by exhibiting opportunistic thermal responses to adjust their behaviour in order to handle high trail temperatures and alter their thermal biology for low temperatures . They will also deliberately expose themselves closely to their thermal maxima . 
 The success of meat ants depends on what resource they are dealing with . In one study , the removal of meat ants allowed the successful foraging of Iridomyrmex ants at carbohydrate sources , but not for protein baits . The success of the ants also did not increase with mealworm baits , suggesting that competition does not always occur between meat ants and other species , and factors , such as food preference , may be involved . In contrast with <unk> and some <unk> , both of their success was affected at numerous food sources with meat ants present . <unk> exhibit no aggression and cannot defend themselves .
