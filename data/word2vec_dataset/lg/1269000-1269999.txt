 Make @-@ up artist Greg Cannom was pleased to be involved in Hannibal as it offered him the chance to produce " incredible and original make @-@ ups " . For Mason Verger , the make @-@ up team would initially produce 20 different heads which looked like zombies and did not reflect the vision Scott had of the character ; Scott wanted Verger to look real with hideous scarring , and not something from the " House of Wax " . Scott himself would actually call up the help of expert doctors in an effort to get the look of the character as realistic as possible . Scott showed the make @-@ up team pictures of foetal things , which he thought touching ; he wanted to make Mason Verger more touching than monstrous , as he thought of Verger as being someone who hadn ’ t lost his sense of humour ... almost sympathetic . Oldman would spend six hours a day in make @-@ up to prepare for the role . 
 For one of the film 's final and infamous scenes , an exact duplicate was created of the character Paul Krendler , played by Ray Liotta , a scene which blended make @-@ up , puppet work and CGI in a way which Scott called " seamless " . 
 = = = Title sequence = = = 
 The main titles were designed by Nick Livesey , a graduate of the Royal College of Art who worked for one of Scott 's production companies in London . The sequence , shot in Florence by Livesey himself was intended as the film 's second promotional trailer . The studio thought it not " quite right " , but it remained on Scott 's mind and would eventually end up as the main title sequence . Livesey would gather footage of pigeons in an empty square in Florence early one morning which , in the final cut , would morph into the face of Hannibal Lecter . Scott believed it a good idea , as it fundamentally asked the question : ' Where is Hannibal Lecter ? ' Scott explains : " And of course this story tells it , with pigeons in the cobblestones of somewhere , where you wonder where that is ... and there he is [ ... ] his face appears . " The titles are said to have been influenced by the film Seven . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Ridley Scott worked very closely with composer Hans Zimmer , during post @-@ production on Hannibal . Scott believes the music to a film is as important as dialogue — " It is the final adjustment to the screenplay , being able to also adjust the performance of the actors in fact . " Zimmer and Scott sat in during the editing process with editor Pietro Scalia to discuss scenes in the film and " not music " . Zimmer used a symphony orchestra for the opera sequence , but would mostly use what he described as a " very odd orchestra ... only cellos and basses all playing at the extreme ends of their range . " This was done to emphasise the character of Hannibal Lecter . He explains : " Anthony 's character is for me somebody at the extreme range of whatever is humanly imaginable somehow . " Zimmer also did not want the score to sound like a " modern day orchestra " . The character Mason Verger had his own " theme " , which become more " perverted " as the film progressed , according to Zimmer . Dante 's sonnet was put to music by Zimmer and Patrick Cassidy for the opera scene in Florence . Tracksounds.com wrote positively of Zimmer 's score . " Zimmer truly crafts a score worthy of most fans ' full attention ... the classical elements , and yes , even the monologue combine to make this an intense listening experience . " In a poll by British Classic FM listeners to find the greatest film soundtrack of all time , Hannibal ranked at No. 59 . Strauss 's The Blue Danube is also played at several points in the film . 
 = = Themes = = 
 = = = Romance = = = 
 Scott has said he believes the underlying emotion of Hannibal is " affection " . " In some instances , you might even wonder or certainly from one direction — is it more than affection ? It is dark , because the story is of course essentially dark , but it 's kind of romantic at the same time . " Scott openly admits to a " romantic thematic " running though the film . He told CNN that : " Hannibal was quite a different target , essentially a study between two individuals . Funny enough , it 's rather romantic and also quite humorous , but also there 's some quite bad behaviour as well . " During the opera scene in Florence , Lecter attends an operatic adaptation of one of Dante 's sonnets , and meets with Detective Pazzi and his wife , Allegra . She asks Lecter , " Do you believe a man could become so obsessed by a woman after a single encounter ? " Lecter replies : " Yes , I believe he could ... but would she see through the bars of his plight and ache for him ? " This scene , in the film , is one which Scott claims most people " missed " the meaning of . It was in reference to Starling — to their encounter in The Silence of the Lambs . The New York Times , in its review of the film , said Hannibal , " toys " with the idea of " love that dare not speak its name " . Composer Hans Zimmer believes there to be " many " messages and subtext in each scene of the film . He said , " I can score this movie truly as a Freudian archetypal beauty and the beast fairy tale , as a horror movie , as the most elegant piece , on corruption in the American police force , as the loneliest woman on earth , the beauty in renaissance ... " Zimmer ultimately believes it to be a dark love story , centering on two people who should never be together — a modern day Romeo and Juliet . During the film 's post @-@ production , Scott , Zimmer and the editor passionately argued about what a single shot meant , where a tear slides down Starling 's cheek during a confrontation with Lecter . They could not agree if it was a tear of " anguish " , " loneliness " or " disgust " . Scott told the New York Post that , the affair of the heart between Lecter and Starling is " metaphorical " . Rolling Stone magazine even said in their review , " Scott offers a sly parody of relationships — think ' When Hannibal met Sally ' . " 
 = = = Retribution and punishment = = = 
 Ridley Scott has said that he believes Lecter , in his own way , to be " pure " — one of the key motivating factors for the character is the search for " retribution and punishment " . 
 " There is something very moral about Lecter in this film , " said Scott in his audio commentary . " The behaviour of Hannibal is never insane — [ I ] didn 't want to use that excuse . Is he insane ? No , I think he 's as sane as you or I. He just likes it . " Scott did say , however , " In our normal terms , he 's truly evil . " Scott also brings up the notion of absolution in reference to Lecter towards the film 's end . Verger has one overriding objective in life : to capture Lecter and subject him to a slow , painful death . 
 = = = Corruption = = = 
 Part of the story involves the character Rinaldo Pazzi ( Giancarlo Giannini ) , a Florentine policeman who learns " Dr. Fell " ' s true identity and realizes that this knowledge could make him rich . His escalating abandonment of morality allows him to countenance and facilitate the death of a gypsy pickpocket , egged on by the desire to have the best for his much younger wife . There is a moment in the film when Pazzi becomes corrupted , despite being what Scott describes as " very thoughtful " . Paul Krendler also succumbs to greed and corruption . Starling does not , however , and perseveres to the end , even refusing to release Lecter when she believes he is about to cut off her hand in order to free himself .

 The first trailer appeared in theaters and was made available via the official website in early May 2000 , over nine months before the film 's release . As the film had only just begun production , footage was used from The Silence of the Lambs . A second trailer , which featured footage from the new film , was released in late November 2000 . In marketing the film , Hopkins ' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was chosen as the unique selling point of Hannibal . " Mr Hopkins is the draw here " , said Elvis Mitchell in a 2001 The New York Times article . A poster released in the UK to promote Hannibal , featuring Lecter with a " skin mask " covering the right side of his face , was quickly removed from circulation as it was deemed " too shocking and disturbing for the public . " 
 Upon its release , Hannibal was met with significant media attention , with the film 's stars and director making several appearances on television , in newspapers and in magazines . In an article for CBS News , Jill Serjeant stated that " the long @-@ awaited sequel to the grisly 1991 thriller Silence of the Lambs is cooking up the hottest Internet and media buzz since the 1999 Star Wars ' prequel ' .

 The reviews for Hannibal were mixed . Time magazine wrote : " A banquet of creepy , gory or grotesque incidents is on display in Hannibal . But this superior sequel has romance in its dark heart . " Empire magazine gave it two out of five stars , calling it " laughable to just plain boring , Hannibal is toothless to the end . " David Thomson , writing in the British Film Institute magazine Sight & Sound , praised the film . " It works . It 's smart , good @-@ looking , sexy , fun ... dirty , naughty and knowing . " Thomson does make clear , however , he is a great fan of director Ridley Scott 's work . He adds : " It is , literally , that Hannibal Lecter has become such a household joke that he can 't be dreadful again . It seems clear that Anthony Hopkins and Scott saw that , and planned accordingly . That 's how the movie was saved . " Variety magazine in its review said " Hannibal is not as good as Lambs ... ultimately more shallow and crass at its heart than its predecessor , Hannibal is nevertheless tantalizing , engrossing and occasionally startling . " 
 A negative review in The Guardian claimed that what was wrong with the film was carried over from the book : " The result is an inflated , good @-@ looking bore of a movie . The Silence of the Lambs was a marvelous thing . This , by contrast is barely <unk> @-@ dokey . " Roger Ebert gave the film a " Thumbs down " rating on the television program At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper and gave the film a 2 @.@ 5 out of 4 stars rating in his print review , which he began with the following : " Ridley Scott 's Hannibal is a carnival geek show . We must give it credit for the courage of its depravity ; if it proves nothing else , it proves that if a man cutting off his face and feeding it to his dogs doesn 't get the NC @-@ 17 rating for violence , nothing ever will . " Hannibal has an overall Metacritic rating of 57 out of 100 from 36 reviews and a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 39 % , with an average rating of 5 @.@ 1 out of 10 from 163 reviews . 
 = = Differences from the novel = = 
 According to Variety magazine , the script for Hannibal was : " quite faithful to the Harris blueprint ; fans of the tome may regret the perhaps necessary excision of some characters , most notably Mason Verger 's muscle @-@ bound macho sister Margot , as well as the considerable fascinating academic detail , but will basically feel the book has been respected ( yes , even the climactic dinner party is served up almost intact , with the only surprise twists saved for its wake ) . " Time Out noted : " The weight @-@ watchers script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew that 's enjoyably spicy but low on substance . So much story is squeezed into 131 minutes that little time 's left for analysis or characterization . " Producer Dino De Laurentiis was asked why some characters , notably Jack Crawford , were left out of the film : " I think if you get a book which is 600 pages , you have to reduce it to a script of 100 pages . In two hours of film , you cannot possibly include all the characters . We set ourselves a limit , and cut characters which weren 't so vital . " 
 In the book , Mason Verger runs an orphanage , from which he calls children to verbally abuse as a substitute for his no longer being able to molest them . He also has a sister , Margot , whom he had raped when they were children and who is a lesbian . When she disclosed her sexual orientation to her family , their father disowned her . As she is sterile due to steroid abuse , Verger exerts some control over her by promising her a semen sample with which to impregnate her lover , who could then inherit the Verger fortune . Also , in the novel , Verger literally has no face and has to be kept in a sterile room at all times to keep bacteria from affecting exposed muscle and tissues . At the book 's end , Margot and Starling both help Lecter escape during a shootout between Starling and Verger 's guards . Margot , at Lecter 's advice , stimulates her brother to ejaculate with a rectally inserted cattle prod , and then kills him by ramming his pet Moray eel down his throat . 
 The book 's controversial ending has Lecter presenting Starling with the exhumed bones of her father , which he " brings to life " by hypnotizing Starling , allowing her to say goodbye . This forges an odd alliance between Starling and Lecter , culminating in their becoming lovers and escaping to Argentina . At the novel 's end , Barney sees them at the Teatro Colón of Buenos Aires . 
 Also gone from the film are the flashbacks to Lecter 's childhood , in which he sees his younger sister , Mischa , eaten by German deserters in 1944 . These flashbacks formed the basis for the 2007 film Hannibal Rising ( written concurrently with the 2006 novel of the same name ) which portrays Lecter as a young man . 
 Hopkins was asked in an interview on the subject of whether or not he believed the idea of Starling and Lecter heading off into the sunset as lovers ( as happens in the book ) . " Yes , I did . Other people found that preposterous . I suppose there 's a moral issue there . I think it would have been a very interesting thing though . I think it would have been very interesting had she gone off , because I suspected that there was that romance , attachment there , that obsession with her . I guessed that a long time ago , at the last phone call to Clarice , at the end of <unk> , she said , ' Dr. Lecter , Dr. Lecter ... ' . "

 = Mushishi ( film ) = 
 Mushishi ( Japanese : <unk> ) , also known in English as Mushi @-@ Shi : The Movie and Bugmaster , is a 2006 Japanese fantasy film directed by Katsuhiro Otomo , based on the manga of the same name . It stars Joe Odagiri as Ginko , a traveler who dedicates himself to protecting the populace from supernatural creatures called Mushi . Otomo began work on the film in 2005 after declining a jidaigeki project . He was interested in creating a mix of live action and animation and felt the manga gave him an appropriate creative vehicle . 
 The film debuted at the Venice International Film Festival in 2006 and was screened at several other festivals prior to its theatrical release on March 24 , 2007 , in Japan . The DVD was released in Japan in 2007 , in the United Kingdom in 2008 , and in North America in 2009 . The film has received a mixed response from film critics . Many praised Odagiri 's performance and its visual but critiqued the plot and mythology as confusing . Mushishi received nominations and awards at film festivals and was among the 100 highest @-@ grossing films of 2007 in Japan . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Mushishi opens with Yoki and his mother walking along a mountain when a cliff suddenly collapses . This is followed by a nonlinear narrative that moves between the past and the present . A series of flashbacks reveal that only Yoki survived , coming under the care of Nui , who is a Mushishi ( or Bugmaster ) — an expert in Mushi , which are supernatural bug @-@ like creatures that are invisible to most humans . She lives near a pond where there are two types of Mushi : a fish @-@ like Ginko who swims in the darkness @-@ like Tokoyami . Because Nui spent too long looking at the Ginko , one of her eyes and the color of her hair were altered by the shadow of Tokoyami . Eventually , Nui is swallowed by the Tokoyami . When Yoki tries to help her , he is also swallowed . Only by sacrificing one of his eyes and his memories is Yoki able to survive . He then renames himself Ginko because it is the only name he can remember . 
 In the present , Ginko , to escape a blizzard , finds a village inn . After revealing himself as a Mushishi , he is asked to help several locals suffering from hearing loss . After he helps the locals , Ginko is asked by the innkeeper to look at her granddaughter , Maho , who is deaf , has horns on her forehead , and hears strange noises . Maho 's mother had the same symptoms and was cremated after her death . Maho , however , kept her mother 's horns , which turned out to be a disguised Mushi and the cause of her illness . Ginko heals the girl and then continues on his journey . 
 Ginko receives a letter requesting his presence from Tanyu , a woman infected with a Mushi that demands her to write about Mushi to expel it . On the way , he meets Koro , a Mushishi who is trying to capture a rainbow @-@ like Mushi . They go to the house of Tanyu , where her nanny , Tama , says that a white @-@ haired woman told them about the Tokoyami . When Tanyu tried to write about it , she was afflicted by paralysis and gangrene . Ginko then asks to read about the Tokoyami ; while he is reading , the Tokoyami from the writings leave them and return to Tanyu , further exacerbating her condition . 
 Ginko faces the Tokoyami itself in the writings warehouse , while Tama and Koro try to remove the Tokoyami by bloodletting . The newly healed Tanyu accompanies Tama and Koro to the warehouse , where they find a collapsed Ginko . Tanyu begins to remove the writings from Ginko 's body and reattach them to the parchments . After Tanyu removes the writings , Ginko awakens and continues on with Koro . The pair finds the rainbow @-@ like Mushi . After this , they part ways , and Koro goes back to his hometown to build bridges . Ginko faces a Tokoyami @-@ possessed Nui and carries her to the River of Light ( or <unk> ) , a stream of glittering Mushi called <unk> — the origin of Mushi life .

 In November 2005 , Katsuhiro Otomo announced that he would direct a live @-@ action film based on Mushishi , a Kodansha manga by Yuki Urushibara , which would star Joe Odagiri and Makiko <unk> and would be released in 2006 . Japan Digital Content Trust planned to raise $ 2 @.@ 2 million ( ¥ 260 million ) of the film 's projected $ 8 @.@ 5 million ( ¥ 1 billion ) budget . Its filming lasted three months , and production of the film took two years . 
 Initially , producer Satoru Ogura came up with the idea of making a jidaigeki in collaboration with the team that worked on Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon . Otomo was not confident in working on " a project of that size " as he had only directed one live @-@ action film in 1991 , titled World Apartment Horror . He instead suggested adapting Mushishi as he felt it would be " an opportunity to mix live action and computer graphics , to create a hybrid of the natural and the virtual " . 
 Otomo felt that the concept of Mushishi was sufficiently unique to interest him creatively . He found the episodic nature of the work challenging but was able to fashion a cohesive screenplay by combining elements of the different stories present in the manga . Although he sent his script to Urushibara for review , she gave him complete creative autonomy . Otomo describes the film as " a kind of fable " , and as such , he chose the Meiji era as its setting because he felt it offered the best framing for the story . The sudden disappearances of certain characters were also consistent with the nature of that historical period . 
 = = Release = = 
 The worldwide premiere of Mushishi took place at the 63rd Venice International Film Festival , which ran from August 30 to September 9 , 2006 . The film was shown at the " Visions " section of the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2006 under the title of Bugmaster . It was later screened in January at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival in the " Spectrum " section . It opened in Japanese theaters on March 24 , 2007 , after the release of a novelization by Naoki <unk> on February 23 , a soundtrack album by Avex on March 14 , and a book with details about the film 's production by Kodansha on March 22 . In October of the same year , it was shown at the 2007 Sitges Film Festival . 
 In Japan , the film was released in DVD format by <unk> Film on October 26 , 2007 . Revolver Entertainment licensed it in January 2008 and was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on February 25 . In September 2008 , Funimation announced that it had acquired the distribution rights of the film to North America . A Blu @-@ Ray version was released in Japan on February 20 , 2009 , while Funimation released its DVD version on August 25 , 2009 , calling it Mushi @-@ Shi : The Movie .

 In its opening weekend in Japan , Mushishi ranked eighth at the box office . In total , it grossed $ 4 @,@ 194 @,@ 890 , making it the 81st best gross of a film released in Japan in 2007 . It was nominated at the Venice Film Festival in the best film category and at the Sitges Film Festival in the best film , best special effects , and best soundtrack categories , winning in the latter two . On its exhibition at the Sundance Film Festival , all tickets were sold out , and some people watched it standing because they did not buy reserved seats . 
 Critical response was mixed . Todd Brown , writing for Twitch Film , characterized the film as " long , slow , fairly pedestrian in its visual style , confusing for the newbies , [ and ] over @-@ familiar for the existing fan " . Anime News Network 's Bamboo Dong praised its visuals but noted that the film could be confusing for viewers who are unfamiliar with the manga series and that Ginko " looks more like a <unk> " . Tony Sullivan of Eye for Film said it is " beautifully acted , shot and scored " but cited the " lack of oomph " as a reason why " the movie is rather dull " . Mark Schilling from The Japan Times praised Odagiri but criticized the film for being " a text too tangled and murky for the uninitiated to easily penetrate or parse " . The cast performance was praised by Variety reviewer Derek Elley who declared its " <unk> and narrative <unk> consign this ' Bug ' to highly specialized outings " . Sullivan , Schilling , and Elley criticized its soundtrack , especially the use of <unk> . 
 Sally Foster from Film Threat praised its visuals and " a few good Japanese @-@ style creep @-@ out scenes " but described the storyline as " incomprehensible " due to " the overabundance " of information about its mythology . John Sinnott of DVD Talk asserted the film could not reach the quality of the manga ; he cited the lack of explanation about Ginko 's background as one of the reasons . Sinnott criticized its slow pace considering its duration and said that " there isn 't much mystery or suspense . " Anthony <unk> from Den of Geek said its plot is " complex at times , and often drifts into the realms of the incomprehensible " . Although he criticized the film 's " pedestrian " pace , <unk> praised Omori 's performance as well as the film 's cinematography and use of CGI . While praising Odagiri 's acting and deeming the film 's visuals an " A @-@ game " , DVD Verdict 's Adam Arseneau said it " feels disjointed and fragmented " . 
 While he preferred the anime version , Mania.com 's Chris Beveridge praised the film as " a soothing and atmospheric movie that captures everything that it should " , singling out Otomo 's direction and Odagiri 's acting . Scott Green from Ain 't It Cool News wrote that he " didn 't find it as breathtaking as Otomo 's anime spectacles or as effecting as earlier version of Mushi @-@ Shi " , but did " find it a fascinating movie to watch and consider " . Joseph Luster from Otaku USA called it " fantastic " though declared Mushishi would not be " nearly as strong without him [ Odagiri ] in the lead " . Kevin Kelly , writing for <unk> , dubbed it " a film not for everyone " because of its storyline 's complexity and " unusual type of mythology and storytelling " . Kelly concluded , " if you like Japanese cinema , fantasy storytelling , and interesting characters , you 'll love this film . " Similarly , Justin Howe of Tor.com declared it is " a bit too inert for most people 's tastes " but said " Mushishi is a fantasy film that 's worth seeing . It 's more eerie than scary , often haunting , and occasionally beautiful . " 
 = Wind power in South Australia = 
 Wind power has become a significant energy source within South Australia over the past decade . As of August 2014 , there was an installed capacity of 1 @,@ 473 MW , which accounts for 27 per cent of electricity production in the state . This represents around half of Australia 's installed wind power capacity . 
 The development of wind power capacity in South Australia has been encouraged by a number of factors . These include the Australian Government 's Renewable Energy Target , which require electricity retailers to source a proportion of energy from renewable sources , incentives from the South Australian Government including a supportive regulatory regime and a payroll tax rebate scheme for large scale renewable energy developments . Also the state 's proximity to the Roaring forties means there are high quality wind resources for wind farms to exploit . In mid @-@ 2009 , <unk> was established by the South Australian Government to encourage further investment in renewable energy in the state . 
 The load factor ( or capacity factor ) for South Australian wind farms is usually in the range 32 @-@ 38 % . This means that a wind farm could typically produce between 32 and 38 % of its nameplate capacity averaged over a year .

As of late 2015 there are a large range of new wind farms in various stages of planning but only one under construction , the <unk> Wind Farm . 
 South Australia has provided regulatory certainty for wind farms , and the government has implemented land use planning policies which represent national best practice for accommodating wind farms . On 2 June 2009 , Premier Mike Rann announced plans to increase South Australia 's renewable energy production target to 33 % by 2020 , well above the national target of 20 % by 2020 .

 In addition to its operating wind farms , South Australia has several proposals for new farms at various stages of development . These include : 
 = = Impacts = = 
 The increasing proportion of renewable energy in the state has caused a significant decrease in the emissions intensity of electricity generation in South Australia . 
 The rapid development of wind power in South Australia has led to direct economic effects from the construction and operation of wind farms . There has been a total of $ 2 @.@ 8 billion in wind power investment up to October 2011 which is estimated to have created 3 @,@ 000 direct and indirect jobs . Studies into the economic effects of wind farms have reported that a 50 MW installation pays host landholders some $ 250 @,@ 000 per year , is constructed by workers who spend up to $ 1 @.@ 2 million locally and contributes up to $ 80 @,@ 000 annually to community projects . 
 Policies to streamline the approval process for wind farm developments have met with some community opposition . Specific concerns have been raised by rural residents who claim that wind farms have an unacceptable impact on property values , health and the environment . 
 There has been some controversy with respect to the impact of the rising share of wind power and other renewables such as solar on retail electricity prices in South Australia . A 2012 report by The Energy Users Association of Australia claimed that retail electricity prices in South Australia were then the third highest in the developed world behind Germany and Denmark , with prices likely to rise to become the most expensive in the near future . The then South Australian Opposition Leader , Isobel Redmond , linked the state 's high retail prices for electricity to the Government 's policy of promoting development of renewable energy , noting that Germany and Denmark had followed similar policies . On the other hand , it has been noted that the impact of wind power on the merit order effect , where relatively low cost wind power is purchased by retailers before higher cost sources of power , has been credited for a decline in the wholesale electricity price in South Australia . Data compiled by the Australian Energy Market Operator ( <unk> ) shows South Australian wholesale electricity prices are the third highest out of Australia 's five mainland states , with the 2013 South Australian Electricity Report noting that increases in prices were " largely driven by transmission and distribution network price increases " . 
 The South Australian Government has stated that the price increase due to the Australian Government 's carbon price ( in place from July 2012 to June 2014 ) was approximately half of that experienced by other states due to the high installed capacity of wind and gas @-@ fired generation .

 In October 2011 the South Australian state Government released a renewable energy plan proposing a range of measures including :

 a ban on new coal @-@ fired power stations 
 greater involvement of local government in the development approval process to promote more effective community engagement 
 investigations into increasing the capacity of transmission lines to support renewable energy developments including wind energy 
 no wind farms allowed within one kilometre of any home unless agreement is reached between the developer and the home owner . 
 = Plesiorycteropus = 
 Plesiorycteropus , also known as the <unk> or Malagasy aardvark , is a recently extinct eutherian mammalian genus from Madagascar . Upon its description in 1895 , it was classified with the aardvark , but more recent studies have found little evidence to link it to aardvarks or any other order of mammals . Therefore , it is now placed in its own order , <unk> , which may be part of Afrotheria . Molecular evidence suggests that it is related to the tenrecs . Two species are currently recognized , the larger P. madagascariensis and the smaller P. germainepetterae . They probably overlapped in distribution , as subfossil remains of both species have been found in the same site . 
 Knowledge of the skeletal anatomy is limited , as only limb and partial pelvis and skull bones have been recovered to date . Plesiorycteropus was probably a digging animal that fed on insects such as termites and ants . It also shows adaptations for climbing and sitting . Estimates of its mass range from 6 to 18 kilograms ( 13 to 40 lb ) . When and why it became extinct remains unknown . One bone has been radiocarbon dated to 200 BCE ; forest destruction by humans may have contributed to its extinction .

 = = = Identification and species = = = 
 French naturalist Henri Filhol first described Plesiorycteropus madagascariensis in 1895 on the basis of a partial skull found at the cave of Belo . His description was vague even by 19th @-@ century standards , but he placed the animal close to the aardvark ( Orycteropus ) . The generic name combines Ancient Greek <unk> " near " with Orycteropus , the genus of the aardvark , and the specific name refers to Madagascar . Charles Lamberton , who had access to a larger sample for his 1946 review of the genus , noted substantial variation , but did not attempt to differentiate multiple species . In 1994 , Ross MacPhee again reviewed Plesiorycteropus and was able to separate two species , the larger P. madagascariensis and a new , smaller species that he named Plesiorycteropus germainepetterae after scientist Germaine Petter . The two species differ in a number of morphological characters in addition to size . 
 Remains of Plesiorycteropus have been misidentified as rodents and primates . Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major described <unk> <unk> in 1908 as a " giant subfossil rat " on the basis of two innominate bones ( pelvic bones ) . The generic name was replaced by Majoria in 1915 , because <unk> was preoccupied by the name of a nematode worm . However , according to MacPhee , <unk> of Majoria are identical to those assigned to Plesiorycteropus . Guillaume Grandidier assigned a well @-@ preserved femur ( upper leg bone ) to a gigantic relative of the living <unk> ( Hypogeomys antimena ) , a large rodent , which he described as Hypogeomys boulei . Lamberton identified this femur as Plesiorycteropus and MacPhee concurred . Remains of both Majoria <unk> and Hypogeomys boulei fall at the upper end of the size range of the genus , indicating that they are referable to P. madagascariensis . Another Plesiorycteropus innominate was mistakenly assigned to Daubentonia robusta , the extinct giant aye @-@ aye , and other material has been misidentified as of a dwarf lemur ( Cheirogaleus ) . 
 = = = Relationships = = = 
 Filhol had classified Plesiorycteropus as close to the aardvark on the basis of morphological similarities . In his 1946 review , Charles Lamberton was unable to provide a definitive allocation , confused by the various similarities he saw with aardvarks , pangolins , armadillos , and anteaters . He believed it was most likely a primitive , isolated member of " Edentata " , a group in which he included aardvarks , pangolins , and Xenarthra ( sloths , armadillos , and anteaters ) . He rejected some alternatives , such as a close affinity to aardvarks or the possibility that the material assigned to Plesiorycteropus did not in fact represent a single animal . Bryan Patterson , who revised tubulidentates ( the order of which the aardvark is the only living representative ) in the 1970s , accepted Plesiorycteropus as a member of the group , dismissing many similarities with pangolins and other animals as convergent . However , he placed it as the only member of its own subfamily <unk> in view of its differences from other tubulidentates ( subfamily <unk> ) , and hypothesized that it arrived on Madagascar in the Eocene , at the same time as the lemurs . Johannes Thewissen , who critiqued some aspects of Patterson 's classification in 1985 , also accepted Plesiorycteropus as a <unk> without comment . 
 Reviewing Patterson 's and Thewissen 's contributions in 1994 , Ross MacPhee found little support for the classification of Plesiorycteropus as a <unk> in their data . MacPhee used a cladistic analysis of eutherians to ascertain the relationships of the genus , but found that while different analytic variants supported different affinities — with aardvarks , hyraxes , ungulates ( <unk> mammals ) , and even <unk> ( shrews , moles , hedgehogs , and allies ) — there was no compelling evidence linking it to any other eutherian group . Therefore , he erected a separate order for Plesiorycteropus , named <unk> , arguing that it would be unacceptable to leave a Recent eutherian unassigned to any order and that discovery of more material , or further analysis , was unlikely to demonstrate close affinities of Plesiorycteropus with any other order . He considered it possible but unlikely that a few fossil taxa , such as <unk> and <unk> from the Paleogene of France , would eventually be found to be <unk> . Various analyses published by Robert Asher and colleagues in 2003 , 2005 , and 2007 , based on morphology combined with DNA sequence data in some analyses , produced different estimates of the relationships of Plesiorycteropus , some placing it within Afrotheria close to aardvarks or <unk> , but others supporting a relationship with the hedgehog <unk> . A 2004 morphological study by Inés Horovitz , focusing on extinct South American ungulates ( such as <unk> and <unk> ) , placed Plesiorycteropus among tubulidentates and closer to the extinct aardvark relative <unk> than to Orycteropus . A 2013 study by Michael Buckley examined preserved collagen sequences in Plesiorycteropus bones . Buckley found that the animal was closely related to the tenrecs , a group of insectivorous mammals native to Madagascar , and suggested that it should be placed in the order <unk> with the tenrecs and golden moles . 
 = = = Common names = = = 
 " Madagascar aardvark " has been used as a common name for Plesiorycteropus , but MacPhee considered it inappropriate because the animal may not be related to aardvarks . Instead , he proposed " <unk> " as a common name , a manufactured Malagasy word meaning " Malagasy animal " . 
 = = Description = = 
 Plesiorycteropus is known from a number of subfossil bones , comparable to coverage of some of the poorly known subfossil lemurs , such as Daubentonia robusta . The material includes several skulls , all of which are missing the facial bones , complete long bones such as the femur and humerus ( upper arm bone ) , and other bones , but some elements are still unknown , including most of the skeleton of the hand and foot . There is little reason to assume it was similar in general form to the aardvark . No teeth or jaws referable to Plesiorycteropus have been found , and it is generally assumed that the animal was toothless . 
 Based on the area of a femur cross @-@ section , MacPhee calculated estimates of body mass . The lowest estimate , based on comparative data from armadillos and pangolins , was 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) for the smallest femur he had ( referable to P. germainepetterae ) and the highest estimate , based on comparative data from <unk> rodents , was 18 kilograms ( 40 lb ) for the largest available femur ( P. madagascariensis ) ; estimates from primates fell between those extremes . MacPhee favored the lower estimates , because those were based on armadillos , which have femora similar to those of Plesiorycteropus . On the other hand , the <unk> model produced a better estimate of brain size in Plesiorycteropus . 
 = = = Skull = = = 
 There are four known skulls ( three of P. madagascariensis and one of P. germainepetterae ) , each of which is damaged . All are missing the front ( rostral ) part , and three are broken at about the same place ( at the paranasal cavities , at the front of the braincase ) , suggesting that the front part of the skull was thinner and more fragile than the back part , which consists of thick bones . MacPhee estimated maximum skull length in P. madagascariensis at 101 millimetres ( 4 @.@ 0 in ) . The length of the frontal bone averages 35 @.@ 4 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 39 in ) in P. madagascariensis and is 29 @.@ 4 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 16 in ) in P. germainepetterae . 
 The robust nasal bones , preserved in a single specimen , are widest at the front , a feature unusual among placentals that is also seen in armadillos , and are also unusually flat . The <unk> labyrinth , in the nasal cavity , was large , suggesting that Plesiorycteropus had a good sense of smell . A much larger part of the nasal septum , which separates the left and right nasal cavities , is ossified than usual in other mammals ; MacPhee could find a similar condition only in sloths , which have a very short nose . The lacrimal bone is relatively large . At it is a single lacrimal canal , which opens near the suture between the frontal and lacrimal bones , like in <unk> . There is a small tubercle ( absent in aardvarks ) near this opening . The orbital cavity , which houses the eyes , is relatively short , similar to the situation in pangolins and armadillos . A distinct tubercle is present on the suture between the frontal and parietal bones in P. germainepetterae , but not P. madagascariensis . P. madagascariensis has a more expansive braincase and a less pronounced narrowing between the orbits . The foramen rotundum , an opening in the bone of the orbit , is present . The optic canal , which houses the nerves leading to the eyes , is narrow , suggesting that the eyes were small , similar to many other <unk> . As in pangolins and xenarthrans , little of the squamosal bone can be seen from above . The temporal lines on the braincase , which anchor muscles , are located lower in P. germainepetterae . Like in aardvarks , the parietals are relatively large . An interparietal bone is present . Unlike in anteaters and pangolins , the occiput ( the back of the skull ) is flat and vertical . Plesiorycteropus lacks notches above the foramen magnum ( the opening that connects the brain to the spinal cord ) , which are present in aardvarks . The nuchal crest , a projection on the occiput , is straight in P. madagascariensis , but in P. germainepetterae it is interrupted in the middle , similar to the situation in armadillos and hyraxes . 
 In their descriptions of Plesiorycteropus , Lamberton and Patterson posited different interpretations of the location of the mandibular fossa , where the mandible ( lower jaw ) articulates with the cranium . MacPhee found problems with either interpretation and suggested that the true mandibular fossa was part of the area Lamberton identified as such , at the side of the braincase . The fossa is small and low , suggesting that the animal was not capable of powerful biting . At the back of this fossa is a <unk> <unk> , which is more prominent in P. germainepetterae . In P. germainepetterae but not P. madagascariensis , a small opening , perhaps the vascular foramen , is present next to the foramen ovale . The petrosal bone forms a relatively large portion of the roof of the tympanic cavity , which houses the middle ear ; parts of the petrosal are more developed in P. madagascariensis . <unk> ( casts of the inside of the skull ) indicate that the <unk> part of the brain was relatively small . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 There are 34 known vertebrae of Plesiorycteropus . The animal had at least seven sacral and five or six lumbar vertebrae . A find of associated caudal vertebrae from the base of the tail , which diminish in size only slowly from front to back , suggests that the tail was long . There is no evidence for the additional joints between the vertebrae that are characteristic of xenarthrans . In the seven known thoracic ( chest ) vertebrae , the articulations with the intervertebral disks are bean @-@ shaped and much wider from side to side than from top to bottom . In the back <unk> and all <unk> , a longitudinal <unk> canal is present in the neural arch . 
 A scapula ( shoulder blade ) , only tentatively assigned to Plesiorycteropus , has the acromion , a process , present , but the structure is probably not as large as in aardvarks or armadillos . Six humeri have been found ; the bone is robust and an entepicondylar foramen is present in the distal ( far ) end . There are three examples of the radius , a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius . The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal ( near ) end is well @-@ developed , but the distal end is narrow ; the morphology of the bone suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms . 
 The innominate is known from seven examples , but most are quite incomplete . It includes a narrow ilium and long ischium . The ischial tuberosity , a narrow rough piece of bone in most placentals , is broad and smooth in Plesiorycteropus . With 17 specimens , the femur is the best represented long bone . It is distinctive in its long neck , similar only to the <unk> <unk> according to MacPhee . A projection known as the third trochanter is larger in P. madagascariensis . The tibia and fibula are extensively fused into a <unk> , of which eight examples are known . This bone resembles that of armadillos in the extensive fusion , the compression of the shaft of the tibia , the narrowness of the articulation surface at the distal end , and the broad space between the bones . Unlike in armadillos , the tibia and fibula are not inclined relative to each other , but about parallel . The astragalus , which is known from four examples , is wide and short and contains a uniquely large <unk> process . Seven metapodials ( middle hand or foot bones ) are known , rather variable in size , but MacPhee was unable to separate metacarpals ( from the hand ) and metatarsals ( from the foot ) . All are rather short and are broad proximally and narrow distally . Among the few known phalanges , the proximal phalange is shorter than the middle one and the distal phalanges are narrow and <unk> . 
 = = Ecology , behavior , and extinction = = 
 The forelimbs of Plesiorycteropus show specializations for scratch @-@ digging , in which the forefeet are placed against the substrate , the claws are entered into the substrate , and the forefeet are then drawn back against the body . Other parts of the body also show such specializations , including large hindlimbs and a broad tail . Some aspects of the vertebral column and the pelvis suggest that the animal often assumed an erect , or sitting , posture . The animal may also have been capable of climbing , perhaps in a manner similar to <unk> and shrew tenrecs , which are small @-@ eyed like Plesiorycteropus . It was probably <unk> , eating insects such as ants and termites , but may also have eaten other soft food , and because of its small size probably did not forage in termite mounds , as the aardvark does . 
 MacPhee had material of Plesiorycteropus from twelve sites in central , western , and southern Madagascar . It and other recently extinct Madagascar mammals may have lived in and near wetlands . P. madagascariensis is known from sites throughout this range , but P. germainepetterae has only been definitely recorded from the center ; small bones from southern sites may also belong to it . Thus , the two species apparently had widely overlapping ranges . 
 Little is known about the extinction of Plesiorycteropus , but MacPhee assumed it may have happened around 1000 years ago , when the extinction of the rest of the subfossil fauna of Madagascar is thought to have concluded . Nothing like it was reported by 17th @-@ century European explorers of the island , and one bone has been radiocarbon dated to around 2150 Before Present ( 200 BCE ) . Its extinction is somewhat anomalous , as other recently extinct Madagascan animals — such as subfossil lemurs , Malagasy hippopotamuses , the giant fossa , and elephant birds — were generally larger and not exclusively insectivorous ; also , some species with likely more specialized diets , such as the falanouc ( <unk> <unk> ) and aye @-@ aye ( Daubentonia madagascariensis ) , did survive . Early human colonists of Madagascar may have caused the extinction of Plesiorycteropus through the destruction of the forest and other disturbances . 
 = Transandinomys = 
 Transandinomys is a genus of rodents in the tribe Oryzomyini of family Cricetidae . It includes two species — T. bolivaris and T. talamancae — found in forests from Honduras in Central America south and east to southwestern Ecuador and northwestern Venezuela in northern South America . Until 2006 , its members were included in the genus Oryzomys , but phylogenetic analysis showed that they are not closely related to the type species of that genus , and they have therefore been placed in a new genus . They may be most closely related to genera like Hylaeamys and Euryoryzomys , which contain very similar species . Both species of Transandinomys have had eventful taxonomic histories . 
 Transandinomys bolivaris and T. talamancae are medium @-@ sized , soft @-@ furred rice rats . The upperparts — brownish in T. bolivaris and reddish in T. talamancae — are much darker than the whitish underparts . Both species are characterized by very long vibrissae ( whiskers ) , but those of T. bolivaris are particularly long . In addition to whisker length and fur color , several other morphological differences distinguish the two , including the wider first upper molar in T. bolivaris . Species of Hylaeamys and Euryoryzomys also differ from Transandinomys in some details of the skull and teeth and have shorter whiskers . Species of Transandinomys live on the ground , are active during the night , eat both plant and animal matter , and construct nests of vegetation . Both are hosts to various external parasites . They are in no apparent danger of extinction and have been assessed as " Least Concern " in the IUCN Red List . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The first species of Transandinomys to be scientifically described was T. talamancae , named as Oryzomys talamancae by Joel Asaph Allen in 1891 . Several other species were soon added to the genus Oryzomys , then more broadly defined than currently , that are now classified in Transandinomys , including Oryzomys bolivaris ( now Transandinomys bolivaris ) by Allen in 1901 . In his 1918 review of North American Oryzomys , Edward Alphonso Goldman placed Oryzomys talamancae and Oryzomys bombycinus ( = T. bolivaris ) each in their own group , but thought them closely related . In 1960 , O. talamancae was synonymized with " Oryzomys capito " ( = Hylaeamys megacephalus ) , but it has again been recognized as a separate species since 1983 . The species was reviewed by Guy Musser and Marina Williams in 1985 and again by Musser and colleagues in 1998 , who documented the diagnostic characters of the species , its synonyms , and its distribution . The 1998 study by Musser and colleagues also documented Oryzomys bolivaris as the correct name for the species previously known as Oryzomys bombycinus and reviewed that species . 
 In 2006 , Marcelo Weksler published a broad phylogenetic analysis of Oryzomyini , the tribe to which Oryzomys and related genera belong , using morphological data and DNA sequences from the IRBP gene . O. talamancae appeared within " clade B " , together with other species formerly associated with Oryzomys capito . Some analyses placed it closest to species now placed in Euryoryzomys or Nephelomys , but with low support . O. bolivaris was not included . Species of Oryzomys included in Weksler 's study did not cluster together in his results , but instead appeared dispersed across Oryzomyini , indicating that the genus was polyphyletic and should be split up . Later in the same year , Weksler , Alexandre Percequillo , and Robert Voss introduced ten new genera of Oryzomyini formerly placed in Oryzomys , including Transandinomys for Oryzomys talamancae and O. bolivaris , with the former as the type species . Transandinomys is now one of about thirty genera within Oryzomyini , a diverse group of well over a hundred species . Oryzomyini is one of several tribes within the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae , which includes hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents , distributed chiefly in Eurasia and the Americas . 
 = = Description = = 
 Transandinomys species are medium @-@ sized , soft @-@ furred rice rats . They closely resemble other medium @-@ sized lowland forest rice rats , such as Hylaeamys and Euryoryzomys from Amazonia and surrounding areas and Handleyomys alfaroi from Central America and northwestern South America . In general , Transandinomys are distinguished from those animals by their very long superciliary vibrissae ( whiskers above the eyes ) . Euryoryzomys species are in general slightly larger and Hylaeamys are about as large as Transandinomys , so that the only feature of external morphology that distinguishes the two genera is the length of the vibrissae . Handleyomys alfaroi is smaller than both species of Transandinomys , but juvenile Transandinomys may be confused with similarly colored adult H. alfaroi . 
 The fur is brownish ( T. bolivaris ) or reddish ( T. talamancae ) above and lighter below , appearing whitish , but the hairs on the underparts have gray bases . The snout is large . The mystacial ( above the mouth ) and superciliary vibrissae both extend to at least the back margin of the ears when laid back against the head , but are much longer in T. bolivaris . The pinna ( external ear ) is large . On the hindfeet , which are long and narrow , ungual tufts of hairs surround the bases of the toes . In T. bolivaris , the sole usually entirely lacks squamae ( small , scale @-@ like structures ) , but T. talamancae does have squamae on part of its sole . The claw of the first toe extends about to the middle of the first phalange of the second and that of the fifth toe extends nearly to the base of the second phalange of the fourth . The tail is at least about as long as the head and body , sometimes slightly longer . The tail is darker above than below in T. talamancae , but there may not be a difference in color in T. bolivaris . The tail appears naked , but is covered with fine hairs . 
 Females have four pairs of mammae , as usual in oryzomyines . Like most rice rats , Transandinomys species have twelve thoracic ( chest ) and seven lumbar vertebrae . According to a study in Costa Rica , T. bolivaris has 58 chromosomes and the number of chromosomal arms ( fundamental number ) is 80 ( 2n 
 = 58 , FN = 
 80 ) . Studies in Ecuador and Venezuela have recorded several different karyotypes in T. talamancae , with the number of chromosomes ranging from 34 to 54 and the fundamental number from 60 to 67 . 
 = = = Skull and teeth = = = 
 In the skull , the rostrum ( front part ) is long . The nasal bones are short , with their back margin not extending beyond the lacrimal bones , which are in contact with both the maxillary and frontal bones . The zygomatic notch is moderately developed and the jugal bone is small , so that when seen from the side the maxillary and squamosal parts of the zygomatic arch ( cheekbone ) overlap . Usually , the suture ( line of fusion ) between the frontal and the squamosal is continuous with that between the frontal and the parietal bone . In T. talamancae , the parietals usually extend from the roof of the braincase broadly on to the sides , but in T. bolivaris they are more commonly restricted to the roof . 
 The incisive foramina ( openings in the front part of the palate ) are short , not extending between the first molars . The posterolateral palatal pits ( small openings at the back of the palate , near the third molars ) are poorly developed . The mesopterygoid fossa , the gap behind the back margin of the palate , does not usually reach forward between the maxillaries . Its roof either is wholly ossified or contains small sphenopalatine vacuities . Unlike in some other oryzomyines , the buccinator @-@ masticatory foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium , two foramina ( openings ) in the skull , are not separated by an alisphenoid strut . The pattern of grooves and foramina in the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head follows the primitive pattern , as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys . Usually , the mastoid bone contains small openings ( fenestrations ) in T. talamancae , but not in T. bolivaris . In the mandible ( lower jaw ) , the capsular process ( a process at the root of the incisor ) is weak to absent and the upper and lower masseteric ridges , which anchor some of the chewing muscles , do not join into a single crest and reach their front margin below the first molar . 
 The upper incisor is opisthodont , with the cutting edge oriented backward . As usual in oryzomyines , the molars are brachydont ( low @-@ crowned ) . The first upper molar is narrower in T. talamancae than in T. bolivaris . Unlike in many other rice rats , including Handleyomys alfaroi and Euryoryzomys species , the mesoflexus on the second upper molar , which separates the paracone ( one of the main cusps ) from the mesoloph ( an accessory crest ) , is not divided in two by an enamel bridge . On the upper third molar , the <unk> ( which in oryzomyines ranges from a slight indentation on the lingual , or inner , side of the tooth to a conspicuous valley between the main cusps ) is more developed in Euryoryzomys than in Transandinomys . The hypoflexid on the second lower molar , the main valley between the cusps , extends more than halfway across the crown ; it is much shorter in H. alfaroi , Euryoryzomys , and Hylaeamys <unk> . Each of the upper molars has three roots ( two at the labial , or outer , side and one at the lingual , or inner , side ) and each of the lowers has two ( one at the front and one at the back ) ; both species of Transandinomys lack the additional small roots that are present in various other oryzomyines , including species of Euryoryzomys , Nephelomys , and Handleyomys . 
 = = Distribution , ecology , and behavior = = 
 The distribution of Transandinomys extends from eastern Honduras through Nicaragua , Costa Rica , Panama , and Colombia south and east to southwestern Ecuador and northern Venezuela , generally west and north of the Andes . The ranges of the two species overlap , but are distinct . T. bolivaris occurs from Honduras mainly on the Caribbean side of Central America south to western Colombia and northwestern Ecuador , up to 1800 m ( 5900 ft ) above sea level . T. talamancae , which is found up to 1525 m ( 5000 ft ) above sea level , is less widely distributed in Central America , as it is not known further north than northwestern Costa Rica , but is more widely distributed in South America , occurring into far southwestern Ecuador and northern Venezuela . It has also been recorded south of the Venezuelan Andes , in the narrow strip of forest between the Llanos and the mountains . Both species are forest rats , but whereas T. bolivaris is restricted to humid forest formations , T. talamancae apparently is more tolerant of drier forest , which explains its wider South American distribution . 
 Both species live on the ground , are active during the night , are solitary , and feed mainly on fruits and seeds , but may also eat herbs and insects . They build nests of leaves and branches among vegetation , for example in a tree hollow , or under rocks . In Panama , T. talamancae breeds throughout the year and the average litter size is about six . Various species of mites , chiggers , fleas , and sucking lice have been recorded as parasites on both species . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 Transandinomys talamancae is common or even abundant , but T. bolivaris generally occurs less frequently . Because both species are widespread , presumably have large populations , and occur in numerous protected areas , they are assessed as " Least Concern " by the IUCN Red List ; deforestation is noted as a possible threat to T. bolivaris , but T. talamancae is said to lack major threats . 
 = Siege of Yorktown = 
 The Siege of Yorktown , also known as the Battle of Yorktown , the Surrender at Yorktown or the German Battle , ending on October 19 , 1781 , at Yorktown , Virginia , was a decisive victory by a combined force of American Continental Army troops led by General George Washington and French Army troops led by the Comte de Rochambeau over a British Army commanded by British lord and Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis . The culmination of the Yorktown campaign , the siege proved to be the last major land battle of the American Revolutionary War in the North American theater , as the surrender by Cornwallis , and the capture of both him and his army , prompted the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict . The battle boosted faltering American morale and revived French enthusiasm for the war , as well as undermining popular support for the conflict in Great Britain . 
 In 1780 5 @,@ 500 French soldiers landed in Rhode Island to assist their American allies in operations against British @-@ controlled New York City . Following the arrival of dispatches from France that included the possibility of support from the French West Indies fleet of the Comte de Grasse , Washington and Rochambeau decided to ask de Grasse for assistance either in besieging New York , or in military operations against a British army operating in Virginia . On the advice of Rochambeau , de Grasse informed them of his intent to sail to the Chesapeake Bay , where Cornwallis had taken command of the army . Cornwallis , at first given confusing orders by his superior officer , Henry Clinton , was eventually ordered to build a defensible deep @-@ water port , which he began to do at Yorktown , Virginia . Cornwallis ' movements in Virginia were shadowed by a Continental Army force led by the Marquis de Lafayette . 
 The French and American armies united north of New York City during the summer of 1781 . When word of de Grasse 's decision arrived , the combined armies began moving south toward Virginia , engaging in tactics of deception to lead the British to believe a siege of New York was planned . De Grasse sailed from the West Indies and arrived at the Chesapeake Bay at the end of August , bringing additional troops and providing a naval blockade of Yorktown . He was transporting 500 @,@ 000 silver pesos collected from the citizens of Havana , Cuba , to fund supplies for the siege and payroll for the Continental Army . While in Santo Domingo , de Grasse met with Francisco Saavedra de <unk> , an agent of Carlos III of Spain . De Grasse had planned to leave several of his warships in Santo Domingo . Saavedra promised the assistance of the Spanish navy to protect the French merchant fleet , enabling de Grasse to sail north with all of his warships . In the beginning of September , he defeated a British fleet led by Sir Thomas Graves that came to relieve Cornwallis at the Battle of the Chesapeake . As a result of this victory , de Grasse blocked any escape by sea for Cornwallis . By late September Washington and Rochambeau arrived , and the army and naval forces completely surrounded Cornwallis . 
 After initial preparations , the Americans and French built their first parallel and began the bombardment . With the British defense weakened , Washington on October 14 , 1781 , sent two columns to attack the last major remaining British outer defenses . A French column took redoubt # 9 and an American column took redoubt # 10 . With these defenses taken , the allies were able to finish their second parallel . With the American artillery closer and more intense than ever , the British situation began to deteriorate rapidly and Cornwallis asked for capitulation terms on the 17th . After two days of negotiation , the surrender ceremony took place on the 19th ; Lord Cornwallis , claiming to be ill , was absent from the ceremony . With the capture of more than 7 @,@ 000 British soldiers , negotiations between the United States and Great Britain began , resulting in the Treaty of Paris in 1783 .

 On December 20 , 1780 , Benedict Arnold sailed from New York with 1 @,@ 500 troops to Portsmouth , Virginia . He first raided Richmond , defeating the defending militia , from January 5 – 7 before falling back to Portsmouth . Admiral Destouches , who arrived in Newport , Rhode Island in July 1780 with a fleet transporting 5 @,@ 500 soldiers , was encouraged by Washington and French Lieutenant General Rochambeau to move his fleet south , and launch a joint land @-@ naval attack on Arnold 's troops . The Marquis de Lafayette was sent south with 1 @,@ 200 men to help with the assault . However , Destouches was reluctant to dispatch many ships , and in February sent only three . After they proved ineffective , he took a larger force of 8 ships in March 1781 , and fought a tactically inconclusive battle with the British fleet of Marriot Arbuthnot at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay . Destouches withdrew due to the damage sustained to his fleet , leaving Arbuthnot and the British fleet in control of the bay 's mouth . 
 On March 26 , Arnold was joined by 2 @,@ 300 troops under command of Major General William Phillips , who took command of the combined forces . Phillips resumed raiding , defeating the militia at Blandford , then burning the tobacco warehouses at Petersburg on April 25 . Richmond was about to suffer the same fate , but Lafayette arrived . The British , not wanting to engage in a major battle , withdrew to Petersburg on May 10 . 
 On May 20 , Charles Cornwallis arrived at Petersburg with 1 @,@ 500 men after suffering heavy casualties at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse . He assumed command , as Phillips had recently died of a fever . Cornwallis had not received permission to abandon the Carolinas from his superior , Henry Clinton , but he believed that Virginia would be easier to conquer , feeling that it favored an invading army . 
 With the arrival of Cornwallis and after more reinforcements from New York , the British Army numbered 7 @,@ 200 men . Cornwallis wanted to push Lafayette , whose force now numbered 3 @,@ 000 men with the arrival of Virginia militia . On May 24 , he set out after Lafayette , who withdrew from Richmond , and linked forces with those under the command of Baron von Steuben and Anthony Wayne . Cornwallis did not pursue Lafayette . Instead , he sent raiders into central Virginia , where they attacked depots and supply convoys , before he recalled them on June 20 . Cornwallis then headed for Williamsburg , and Lafayette 's force of now 4 @,@ 500 followed him . General Clinton , in a confusing series of orders , ordered Cornwallis first to Portsmouth and then Yorktown , where he was instructed to build fortifications for a deep water port . 
 On July 6 , the French and American armies met at White Plains , north of New York City . Although Rochambeau had almost 40 years of warfare experience , he never challenged Washington 's authority , telling Washington he had come to serve , not to command . 
 Washington and Rochambeau discussed where to launch a joint attack . Washington believed an attack on New York was the best option , since the Americans and French now outnumbered the British defenders 3 to 1 . Rochambeau disagreed , arguing the fleet in the West Indies under Admiral de Grasse was going to sail to the American coast , where easier options than attacking New York could be attempted . 
 In early July , Washington suggested an attack be made at the northern part of Manhattan Island , but his officers and Rochambeau all disagreed . Washington continued to probe the New York area until August 14 , when he received a letter from de Grasse stating he was headed for Virginia with 29 warships and 3 @,@ 200 soldiers , but could only remain there until October 14 . De Grasse encouraged Washington to move south so they could launch a joint operation . Washington abandoned his plan to take New York , and began to prepare his army for the march south to Virginia . 
 = = March to Virginia = = 
 The march to Yorktown led by Washington and Rochambeau began on August 19 and has become known as the celebrated march . 4 @,@ 000 French and 3 @,@ 000 American soldiers began the march in Newport , Rhode Island , while the rest remained behind to protect the Hudson Valley . Washington wanted to keep absolute secrecy as to where they were headed . Washington sent out fake dispatches that reached Clinton , and convinced him that the Franco @-@ American army was going to launch an attack on New York , and that Cornwallis was not in any danger . 
 The French and American armies paraded through Philadelphia from September 2 to 4th , where the American soldiers announced they would not leave Maryland until they received one month 's pay in coin , rather than in the worthless Continental paper currency . General Rochambeau generously loaned Washington half of his supply of gold Spanish coins . This would be the last time the men would be paid . It also went a long way to strengthening the bond between the French and the Americans . On September 5 , Washington learned of the arrival of de Grasse 's fleet off the Virginia Capes . De Grasse debarked his French troops to join Lafayette , and then sent his empty transports to pick up the American troops . Washington made a visit to his home , Mount Vernon , on his way to Yorktown . 
 In August , Admiral Sir Thomas Graves led a fleet from New York to attack de Grasse 's fleet . Graves did not realize how large the French fleet was , and neither did Cornwallis . The British fleet was defeated by de Grasse 's fleet in the Battle of the Chesapeake on September 5 , and forced to fall back to New York . On September 14 , Washington arrived in Williamsburg , Virginia .

 On September 26 , transports with artillery , siege tools , and some French infantry and shock troops from Head of Elk , the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay , arrived , giving Washington command of an army of 7 @,@ 800 Frenchmen , 3 @,@ 100 militia , and 8 @,@ 000 Continentals . Early on September 28 , Washington led the army out of Williamsburg to surround Yorktown . The French took the positions on the left while the Americans took the position of honor on the right . Cornwallis had a chain of seven redoubts and batteries linked by earthworks along with batteries that covered the narrows of the York River at Gloucester Point . That day , Washington reconnoitered the British defenses and decided that they could be bombarded into submission . The Americans and the French spent the night of the 28th sleeping out in the open , while work parties built bridges over the marsh . Some of the American soldiers hunted down wild hogs to eat . 
 On September 29 , Washington moved the army closer to Yorktown and British gunners opened up on the infantry . Throughout the day several British cannon fired on the Americans but there were few casualties . Fire was also exchanged between American riflemen and Hessian Jägers . 
 Cornwallis pulled back from all of his outer defenses , except for the Fusilier 's redoubt on the west side of the town and redoubts 9 and 10 in the east . Cornwallis had his forces occupy the earthworks immediately surrounding the town because he had received a letter from Clinton that promised relief force of 5 @,@ 000 men within a week and he wished to tighten his lines . The Americans and the French occupied the abandoned defenses and began to establish their own batteries there . With the British outer defenses in their hands , allied engineers began to lay out positions for the artillery . The men improved their works and deepened their trenches . The British also worked on improving their defenses . 
 On September 30 , the French attacked the British Fusiliers redoubt . The skirmish lasted two hours , in which the French were repulsed suffering several casualties . On October 1 , the allies learned from British deserters that , to preserve their food , the British had slaughtered hundreds of horses and thrown them on the beach . In the American camp , thousands of trees were cut down to provide wood for earthworks . Preparations for the parallel also began . 
 As the allies began to put their artillery into place , the British kept up a steady fire to disrupt them . British fire increased on the 2nd and the allies suffered moderate casualties . General Washington continued to make visits to the front , despite concern shown by several of his officers over the increasing enemy fire . On the night of October 2 , the British opened a storm of fire to cover up the movement of the British cavalry to Gloucester where they were to escort infantrymen on a foraging party . On the 3rd , the foraging party , led by Banastre Tarleton , went out but collided with Lauzun 's Legion , and John Mercer 's Virginia militia , led by the Marquis de <unk> . The British cavalry quickly retreated back behind their defensive lines , losing 50 men . 
 By October 5 , Washington was almost ready to open the first parallel . That night the sappers and miners worked , putting strips of pine on the wet sand to mark the path of the trenches . 
 = = = Bombardment = = = 
 After nightfall on October 6 , troops moved out in stormy weather to dig the first parallel : the heavily overcast sky negated the waning full moon and shielded the massive digging operation from the eyes of British sentries . Washington ceremoniously struck several blows with his pick axe to begin the trench . The trench was to be 2 @,@ 000 yards ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) long , running from the head of Yorktown to the York River . Half of the trench was to be commanded by the French , the other half by the Americans . On the northernmost end of the French line , a support trench was dug so that they could bombard the British ships in the river . The French were ordered to distract the British with a false attack , but the British were told of the plan by a French deserter and the British artillery fire turned on the French from the Fusiliers redoubt . 
 On October 7 , the British saw the new allied trench just out of musket @-@ range . Over the next two days the allies completed the gun placements and dragged the artillery into line . The British fire began to weaken when they saw the large number of guns the allies had . 
 By October 9 , all of the French and American guns were in place . Among the American guns there were three twenty @-@ four pounders , three eighteen pounders , two eight @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) howitzers and six mortars , totaling fourteen guns . At 3 : 00 pm , the French guns opened the barrage and drove the British frigate , HMS Guadeloupe across the York River , where she was scuttled to prevent capture . At 5 : 00 pm the Americans opened fire . Washington fired the first gun ; legend has it that this shot smashed into a table where British officers were eating . The Franco @-@ American guns began to tear apart the British defenses . Washington ordered that the guns fire all night so that the British could not make repairs . All of the British guns on the left were soon silenced . The British soldiers began to pitch their tents in their trenches and soldiers began to desert in large numbers . Some British ships were also damaged by cannonballs that flew across the town into the harbor . 
 On October 10 , the Americans spotted a large house in Yorktown . Believing that Cornwallis might be stationed there , they aimed at it and quickly destroyed it . Cornwallis sank more than a dozen of his ships in the harbor . The French began to fire at the British ships and scored a hit on the British HMS Charon , which caught fire , and in turn set two or three other ships on fire . Cornwallis received word from Clinton that the British fleet was to depart on October 12 , however Cornwallis responded by saying that he would not be able to hold out for long . 
 On the night of October 11 , Washington ordered that the Americans dig a second parallel . It was 400 yards ( 370 m ) closer to the British lines , but could not be extended to the river because the British number 9 and 10 redoubts were in the way . During the night , the British fire continued to land in the old line ; Cornwallis did not suspect that a new parallel was being dug . By morning of the 12th , the allied troops were in position on the new line . 
 = = = Assault on the redoubts = = = 
 By October 14 , the trenches were within 150 yards ( 140 m ) of redoubts # 9 and # 10 . Washington ordered that all guns within range begin blasting the redoubts to weaken them for an assault that evening . Washington planned to use the cover of a moonless night to gain the element of surprise . To reinforce the darkness , he added silence , ordering that no soldier should load his musket until reaching the <unk> the advance would be made with only " cold steel . " Redoubt 10 was near the river and held only 70 men , while redoubt 9 was a quarter of a mile inland , and was held by 120 British and Germans . Both redoubts were heavily fortified with rows of abatis surrounding them , along with muddy ditches that surrounded the redoubts at about 25 yards ( 23 m ) . Washington devised a plan in which the French would launch a diversionary attack on the Fusiliers redoubt , and then a half an hour later , the French would assault redoubt 9 and the Americans redoubt 10 . Redoubt 9 would be assaulted by 400 French regular soldiers under the command of the German Lieutenant Colonel Wilhelm von Zweibrücken and redoubt 10 would be assaulted by 400 light infantry troops under the command of Alexander Hamilton . There was briefly a dispute as to who should lead the attack on redoubt # 10 . Lafayette named his aide , Jean @-@ Joseph <unk> de <unk> , who commanded a battalion of Continental light infantry . However , Hamilton protested , saying that he was the senior officer . Washington concurred with Hamilton and gave him command of the attack . 
 At 6 : 30 pm , gunfire announced the diversionary attack on the Fusiliers redoubt . At other places in the line , movements were made as if preparing for an assault on Yorktown itself , which caused the British to panic . With bayonets fixed , the Americans marched towards redoubt # 10 . Hamilton sent Lieutenant Colonel John Laurens around to the rear of the redoubt to prevent the British from escaping . The Americans reached the redoubt and began chopping through the British wooden defenses with their axes . A British sentry called a challenge , and then fired at the Americans . The Americans responded by charging with their bayonets towards the redoubt . They hacked through the abatis , crossed a ditch and climbed the parapet into the redoubt . The Americans forced their way into the redoubt falling into giant shell holes from the bombardment of the redoubts . The British fire was heavy , but the Americans overwhelmed them . Someone in the front shouted , " Rush on boys ! The fort 's ours ! " The British threw hand grenades at the Americans with little effect . Men in the trench stood on the shoulders of their comrades to climb into the redoubt . The bayonet fight cleared the British out of the redoubt and almost the entire garrison was captured , including the commander of the redoubt , Major Campbell . In the assault , the Americans lost 9 dead and 25 wounded . 
 The French assault began at the same time , but they were halted by the abatis , which was undamaged by the artillery fire . The French began to hack at the abatis and a Hessian sentry came out and asked who was there . When there was no response , the sentry opened fire as did other Hessians on the <unk> the French soldiers fired back , and then charged the redoubt . The Germans charged the Frenchmen climbing over the walls but the French fired a volley , driving them back . The Hessians then took a defensive position behind some barrels but threw down their arms and surrendered when the French prepared a bayonet charge . 
 With the capture of redoubts 9 and 10 , Washington was able to have his artillery shell the town from three directions and the allies moved some of their artillery into the redoubts . On October 15 , Cornwallis turned all of his guns onto the nearest allied position . He then ordered a storming party of 350 British troops under the command of Colonel Robert Abercromby to attack the allied lines and spike the American and French cannon ( i.e. , plug the touch hole with an iron spike ) . The allies were sleeping and unprepared . As the British charged Abercromby shouted " Push on my brave boys , and skin the bastards ! " The British party spiked several cannon in the parallel and then spiked the guns on an unfinished redoubt . A French party came and drove them out of the allied lines and back to Yorktown . The British had been able to spike six guns , but by the morning they were all repaired . The bombardment resumed with the American and French troops engaged in competition to see who could do the most damage to the enemy defenses . 
 On the morning of October 16 , more allied guns were in line and the fire intensified . In desperation , Cornwallis attempted to evacuate his troops across the York River to Gloucester Point . At Gloucester Point the troops might be able to break through the allied lines and escape into Virginia and then march to New York . One wave of boats made it across but a squall hit when they returned to take more soldiers across , making the evacuation impossible . 
 = = = British surrender = = = 
 The fire on Yorktown from the allies was heavier than ever as new artillery pieces joined the line . Cornwallis talked with his officers that day and they agreed that their situation was hopeless . 
 On the morning of October 17 , a drummer appeared followed by an officer waving a white handkerchief . The bombardment ceased , and the officer was blindfolded and led behind the French and American lines . Negotiations began at the Moore House on October 18 between Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Dundas and Major Alexander Ross ( who represented the British ) and Lieutenant Colonel Laurens ( who represented the Americans ) and the Marquis de Noailles ( who represented the French ) . To make sure that nothing fell apart between the French and Americans at the last minute , Washington ordered that the French be given an equal share in every step of the surrender process . 
 The articles of capitulation were signed on October 19 , 1781 . Signatories included Washington , Rochambeau , the Comte de Barras ( on behalf of the French Navy ) , Cornwallis , and Captain Thomas Symonds ( the senior Royal Navy officer present ) . Cornwallis ' British men were declared prisoners of war , promised good treatment in American camps , and officers were permitted to return home after taking their parole . At 2 : 00 pm the allied army entered the British positions , with the French on the left and the Americans on the right . 
 The British had asked for the traditional honors of war , which would allow the army to march out with flags waving , bayonets fixed , and the band playing an American or French tune as a tribute to the victors . However , Washington firmly refused to grant the British the honors that they had denied the defeated American army the year before at the Siege of Charleston . Consequently , the British and Hessian troops marched with flags furled and muskets shouldered , while the band was forced to play " a British or German march . " According to legend , the British drummers and <unk> played the tune " The World Turn 'd Upside Down " , which was actually a popular British marching tune of the time , but curiously appropriate under the circumstances . The British soldiers had been issued new uniforms hours before the surrender and until prevented by General O 'Hara some threw down their muskets with the apparent intention of smashing them . Others wept or appeared to be drunk . In all , 8 @,@ 000 troops , 214 artillery pieces , thousands of muskets , 24 transport ships , wagons and horses were captured . 
 Cornwallis refused to meet formally with Washington , and also refused to come to the ceremony of surrender , claiming illness . Instead , Brigadier General Charles O 'Hara presented the sword of surrender to Rochambeau . Rochambeau shook his head and pointed to Washington . O 'Hara offered it to Washington , but he refused to accept it , and motioned to his second in command , Benjamin Lincoln , who had been humiliated by the British at Charleston , to accept it . The British soldiers marched out and laid down their arms in between the French and American armies , while many civilians watched . At this time , the troops on the other side of the river in Gloucester also surrendered . 
 = = = Casualties = = = 
 The French casualties were 60 killed and 194 wounded and the American casualties were 28 killed and 107 wounded : a grand total of 88 killed and 301 wounded . 
 The British official casualty return for the siege listed 156 killed , 326 wounded and 70 missing . Cornwallis surrendered 7 @,@ 087 officers and enlisted men in Yorktown when he capitulated and a further 840 sailors from the British fleet in the York River . Another 84 prisoners had been taken during the assault on the redoubts on October 16 . Since only 70 men were reported as missing , this would suggest that 14 of the men officially marked down as ‘ killed ’ had in fact been captured . This gives a grand total of 142 killed , 326 wounded prisoners and 7 @,@ 685 other prisoners . Jerome A. Greene mentions a German account that gives much higher figures : 309 killed and 595 wounded .

 George Washington refused to accept the Tenth Article of the Articles of Capitulation , which granted immunity to American Loyalists , and Cornwallis failed to make any effort to press the matter . " The outcry against the Tenth Article was vociferous and immediate , as Americans on both sides of the Atlantic proclaimed their sense of betrayal . "

 Malaria was endemic in the marshlands of eastern Virginia during the time , and Cornwallis 's army suffered greatly from the disease ; he estimated during the surrender that half of his army was unable to fight as a result . The Continental Army enjoyed an advantage , in that most of their members had grown up with malaria , and hence had acquired resistance to the disease . As malaria has a month @-@ long incubation period , most of the French soldiers had not begun to exhibit symptoms before the surrender .

 Five days after the battle ended , on October 24 , 1781 , the British fleet sent by Clinton to rescue the British army arrived . The fleet picked up several Loyalists who had escaped on October 18 , and they informed Admiral Thomas Graves that they believed Cornwallis had surrendered . Graves picked up several more Loyalists along the coast , and they confirmed this fact . Graves sighted the French Fleet , but chose to leave because he was outnumbered by nine ships , and thus he sent the fleet back to New York . 
 After the British surrender , Washington sent Tench Tilghman to report the victory to Congress . After a difficult journey , he arrived in Philadelphia , which celebrated for several days . The British Prime Minister , Lord North , is reported to have exclaimed " Oh God , it 's all over " when told of the defeat . Washington moved his army to New Windsor , New York where they remained stationed until the Treaty of Paris was signed on September 3 , 1783 , formally ending the war .

 On October 19 , 1881 , an elaborate ceremony took place to honor the battle 's centennial . U.S. naval vessels floated on Chesapeake Bay , and special markers highlighted where Washington and Lafayette 's siege guns were placed . President Chester Arthur , sworn in only thirty days before , following James Garfield 's death , made his first public speech as president . Also present were descendants of Lafayette , Rochambeau , de Grasse , and Steuben . To close the ceremony , Arthur gave an order to salute the British flag . 
 There is a belief that General Cornwallis 's sword , surrendered by Charles O 'Hara after the battle , is to this day on display at the White House . However , U.S. National Park Service historian Jerome Green , in his 2005 history of the siege , The Guns of Independence , concurs with the 1881 centennial account by Johnston , noting simply that when Brigadier General O 'Hara presented the sword to Major General Lincoln , " he held it for a moment and immediately returned it to O 'Hara . " 
 The siege of Yorktown is also known in some German historiographies as " die deutsche Schlacht " ( " the German battle " ) , because Germans played significant roles in all three armies , accounting for roughly one third of all forces involved . According to one estimate more than 2 @,@ 500 German soldiers served at Yorktown with each of the British and French armies , and more than 3 @,@ 000 German @-@ Americans were in Washington 's army . 
 Four Army National Guard units ( 113th Inf , 116th Inf , 175th Inf and 198th Sig Bn ) and one active Regular Army Field Artillery battalion ( 1 @-@ 5th FA ) are derived from American units that participated in the Battle of Yorktown .

 Anna Eleanor Roosevelt ( / <unk> <unk> / ; October 11 , 1884 – November 7 , 1962 ) was an American politician , diplomat , and activist . She was the longest @-@ serving First Lady of the United States , having held the post from March 1933 to April 1945 during her husband President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's four terms in office , and served as United States Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly from 1945 to 1952 . President Harry S. Truman later called her the " First Lady of the World " in tribute to her human rights achievements . 
 Roosevelt was a member of the prominent American Roosevelt and Livingston families and a niece of President Theodore Roosevelt 's . She had an unhappy childhood , having suffered the deaths of both parents and one of her brothers at a young age . At 15 , she attended Allenwood Academy in London and was deeply influenced by its feminist headmistress Marie Souvestre . Returning to the U.S. , she married her fifth cousin once removed , Franklin Delano Roosevelt , in 1905 . The Roosevelts ' marriage was complicated from the beginning by Franklin 's controlling mother , Sara , and after discovering an affair of her husband 's with Lucy Mercer in 1918 , Roosevelt resolved to seek fulfillment in a public life of her own . She persuaded Franklin to stay in politics after he was stricken with debilitating polio in 1921 , which cost him the use of his legs , and Roosevelt began giving speeches and appearing at campaign events in his place . Following Franklin 's election as Governor of New York in 1928 , and throughout the remainder of Franklin 's public career in government , Roosevelt regularly made public appearances on his behalf , and as First Lady while her husband served as President , she significantly reshaped and redefined the role of that office during her own tenure and beyond , for future First Ladies . 
 Though widely respected in her later years , Roosevelt was a controversial First Lady for her outspokenness , particularly her stance on racial issues . She was the first presidential spouse to hold press conferences , write a syndicated newspaper column , and speak at a national convention . On a few occasions , she publicly disagreed with her husband 's policies . She launched an experimental community at Arthurdale , West Virginia , for the families of unemployed miners , later widely regarded as a failure . She advocated for expanded roles for women in the workplace , the civil rights of African Americans and Asian Americans , and the rights of World War II refugees . 
 Following her husband 's death , Roosevelt remained active in politics for the rest of her life . She pressed the United States to join and support the United Nations and became its first delegate . She served as the first chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights , and oversaw the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Later she chaired the John F. Kennedy administration 's Presidential Commission on the Status of Women . By the time of her death , Roosevelt was regarded as " one of the most esteemed women in the world " ; she was called " the object of almost universal respect " in her New York Times obituary . In 1999 , she was ranked ninth in the top ten of Gallup 's List of Most Widely Admired People of the 20th Century .

 Anna Eleanor Roosevelt was born at 56 West 37th Street in Manhattan , New York City , to socialites Elliott Bulloch Roosevelt ( 1860 – 1894 ) and Anna Rebecca Hall ( 1863 – 1892 ) . From an early age , she preferred to be called by her middle name ( Eleanor ) . Through her father , she was a niece of President Theodore " T.R. " Roosevelt , Jr . ( 1858 – 1919 ) . Through her mother , she was a niece of tennis champions Valentine Gill " <unk> " Hall III ( 1867 – 1934 ) and Edward Ludlow Hall ( 1872 – 1932 ) . She acted in such an old @-@ fashioned manner as a child that her mother nicknamed her " Granny " . 
 Eleanor had two younger brothers : Elliott Jr . ( 1889 – 1893 ) and Hall ( 1891 – 1941 ) . She also had a half brother , Elliott Roosevelt Mann ( c . 1890 – 1941 ) , through her father 's affair with Katy Mann , a servant employed by the family . Roosevelt was born into a world of immense wealth and privilege , as her family was part of New York high society called the " swells " . 
 Her mother died from diphtheria on December 7 , 1892 , and Elliott Jr. died of the same disease the following May . Her father , an alcoholic confined to a sanitarium , died on August 14 , 1894 after jumping from a window during a fit of delirium tremens . He survived the fall but died from a seizure . Her brother Hall would also suffer from alcoholism . Eleanor 's childhood losses left her prone to depression throughout her life . 
 After the deaths of her parents , Eleanor was raised in the household of her maternal grandmother , Mary Livingston Ludlow ( 1843 – 1919 ) of the Livingston family in Tivoli , New York . In his Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning biography of Eleanor Roosevelt , Joseph P. Lash describes her in childhood as insecure and starved for affection , and she considered herself the " ugly duckling " . However , Roosevelt wrote at 14 that one 's prospects in life were not totally dependent on physical beauty : " no matter how plain a woman may be if truth and loyalty are stamped upon her face all will be attracted to her . " 
 Roosevelt was tutored privately and , at the age of 15 , with the encouragement of her aunt Anna " <unk> " Roosevelt , the family sent her to Allenswood Academy , a private finishing school in Wimbledon , outside London , England , from 1899 to 1902 . The headmistress , Marie Souvestre , was a noted feminist educator who sought to cultivate independent thinking in young women . Souvestre took a special interest in Roosevelt , who learned to speak French fluently and gained self @-@ confidence . Her first cousin Corinne Douglas Robinson , whose first term at Allenswood overlapped with Eleanor 's last , said that when she arrived at the school , Eleanor was " ' everything ' at the school . She was beloved by everybody . " Roosevelt wished to continue at Allenswood , but in 1902 was summoned home by her grandmother to make her social debut . 
 In 1902 – at age 17 – Roosevelt returned to the United States , ending her formal education , and was presented at a debutante ball at the Waldorf @-@ Astoria hotel on December 14 . She was later given her own " coming out party " . Roosevelt was active with the New York Junior League shortly after its founding , teaching dancing and calisthenics in the East Side slums . The organization had been brought to Roosevelt 's attention by her friend , organization founder Mary Harriman , and a male relative who criticized the group for " drawing young women into public activity " . 
 = = = Marriage and family life = = = 
 In the summer of 1902 , Eleanor encountered her father 's fifth cousin , Franklin Delano Roosevelt ( 1882 – 1945 ) , on a train to Tivoli , New York . The two began a secret correspondence and romance , and became engaged on November 22 , 1903 . Franklin 's mother , Sara Ann Delano , opposed the union , and made him promise that the engagement would not be officially announced for a year . " I know what pain I must have caused you , " Franklin wrote his mother of his decision . But , he added , " I know my own mind , and known it for a long time , and know that I could never think otherwise . " Sara took her son on a Caribbean cruise in 1904 , hoping that a separation would squelch the romance , but Franklin remained determined . The wedding date was set to accommodate President Theodore Roosevelt , who agreed to give the bride away . 
 Eleanor married Franklin on March 17 , 1905 ( St. Patrick 's Day ) , in a wedding officiated by Endicott Peabody , the groom 's headmaster at Groton School . The wedding date itself was selected with Theodore Roosevelt , the sitting president , in mind , since he was already scheduled to be in New York for the St. Patrick 's Day parade . Theodore Roosevelt , who signed the marriage certificate as a witness , gave his niece Eleanor away since her father had died years before . He garnered almost all the attention from the press , and his attendance at the ceremony was front @-@ page news , including in the New York Times . When asked for his thoughts on the Roosevelt @-@ Roosevelt union , Theodore Roosevelt said , " It is a good thing to keep the name in the family . " The couple spent a preliminary honeymoon of one week at Hyde Park , then set up housekeeping in an apartment in New York . That summer they went on their formal honeymoon , a three @-@ month tour of Europe . 
 Returning to the U.S. , the newlyweds settled in New York City , in a house provided by Franklin 's mother , as well as at the family 's estate overlooking the Hudson River in Hyde Park , New York . From the beginning , Eleanor had a contentious relationship with her controlling mother @-@ in @-@ law . The townhouse Sara gave to Eleanor and Franklin was connected to her own by sliding doors , and Sara ran both households in the decade after the marriage . Early on , Eleanor had a breakdown in which she explained to Franklin that " I did not like to live in a house which was not in any way mine , one that I had done nothing about and which did not represent the way I wanted to live " , but little changed . Sara also sought to control the raising of her grandchildren , and Eleanor reflected later that " Franklin 's children were more my mother @-@ in @-@ law 's children than they were mine " . Eleanor 's eldest son James remembered Sara telling her grandchildren , " Your mother only bore you , I am more your mother than your mother is . " 
 Eleanor and Franklin had six children : 
 Anna Eleanor Roosevelt ( May 3 , 1906 – December 1 , 1975 ) 
 James Roosevelt II ( December 23 , 1907 – August 13 , 1991 ) 
 Franklin Roosevelt ( March 18 , 1909 – November 1 , 1909 ) 
 Elliott Roosevelt ( September 23 , 1910 – October 27 , 1990 ) 
 Franklin Delano Roosevelt , Jr . ( August 17 , 1914 – August 17 , 1988 ) 
 John Aspinwall Roosevelt II ( March 13 , 1916 – April 27 , 1981 ) 
 Despite becoming pregnant and giving birth six times , Eleanor disliked sex . She once told her daughter Anna that it was an " ordeal to be borne " . She also considered herself ill @-@ suited to motherhood , later writing , " It did not come naturally to me to understand little children or to enjoy them " . 
 In September 1918 , while unpacking a suitcase of Franklin 's , Eleanor discovered a bundle of love letters to him from her social secretary , Lucy Mercer . He had been contemplating leaving Eleanor for Lucy . However , following pressure from Franklin 's political advisor , Louis Howe , and from his mother Sara , who threatened to disinherit her son if he divorced , Franklin remained married to Eleanor . However , the union from that point on was more of a political partnership . Disillusioned , Eleanor again became active in public life , and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife , as she had for the previous decade . 
 In August 1921 , the family was vacationing at Campobello Island , New Brunswick , when Franklin was stricken with polio , which permanently paralyzed his legs . When the extent of his disability became clear , Eleanor fought a protracted battle with her mother @-@ in @-@ law over his future , persuading him to stay in politics despite Sara 's urgings that he retire and become a country gentleman . This proved a turning point in Eleanor and Sara 's long @-@ running struggle , and as Eleanor 's public role grew , she increasingly broke from Sara 's control . Tensions between Sara and Eleanor over her new political friends rose to the point that the family constructed a cottage , Val @-@ Kill , which Eleanor and her guests lived in when Franklin and the children were away from Hyde Park . 
 = = = Other relationships = = = 
 In the 1930s , Eleanor had a very close relationship with legendary pilot Amelia Earhart . One time , the two sneaked out from the White House and went to a party dressed up for the occasion . 
 Roosevelt also had a close relationship with Associated Press ( AP ) reporter Lorena Hickok , who covered her during the last months of the presidential campaign and " fell madly in love with her " . During this period , Roosevelt wrote daily 10- to 15 @-@ page letters to " Hick " , who was planning to write a biography of the First Lady . The letters included such <unk> as , " I want to put my arms around you & kiss you at the corner of your mouth , " and , " I can 't kiss you , so I kiss your ' picture ' good night and good morning ! " At Franklin 's 1933 inauguration , Eleanor wore a sapphire ring Hickok had given her . FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover despised Roosevelt 's liberalism , her stance regarding civil rights , and her and her husband FDR 's criticisms of Hoover 's surveillance tactics , and so Hoover maintained a large file on Roosevelt , which the filmmakers of the biopic J. Edgar ( 2011 ) indicate included compromising evidence of this relationship , which Hoover intended to blackmail Roosevelt with . Compromised as a reporter , Hickok soon resigned her position with the AP to be closer to Eleanor , who secured her a job as an investigator for a New Deal program . 
 There is considerable debate about whether or not Roosevelt 's relationship with Hickok was sexual . It was known in the White House press corps at the time that Lorena Hickok was a lesbian . Scholars , including Lillian Faderman and Hazel Rowley , have asserted that there was a physical component to the relationship , while Hickok biographer Doris Faber has argued that the <unk> phrases have misled historians . Doris Kearns Goodwin stated in her 1994 Pulitzer Prize – winning account of the Roosevelts that " whether Hick and Eleanor went beyond kisses and hugs " could not be determined with certainty . Roosevelt was close friends with several lesbian couples , such as Nancy Cook and Marion Dickerman , and Esther Lape and Elizabeth Read , suggesting that she was familiar with the lifestyle ; Marie Souvestre , Roosevelt 's childhood teacher and a great influence on her later thinking , was also a lesbian . Faber published some of Roosevelt and Hickok 's correspondence in 1980 , but concluded that the lovestruck phrasing was simply an " unusually belated schoolgirl crush " and warned historians not to be misled . Researcher Leila J. Rupp criticized Faber 's argument , calling her book " a case study in homophobia " and arguing that Faber unwittingly presented " page after page of evidence that delineates the growth and development of a love affair between the two women " . In 1992 , Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook argued that the relationship was in fact romantic , generating national attention . 
 A few months after FDR 's first inauguration , Eleanor wrote to " Hick " : " And so you think they gossip about us .... I am always so much more optimistic than you are . I suppose because I care so little about what ' they ' say . " 
 In the same years , Washington gossip linked Eleanor romantically with New Deal administrator Harry Hopkins , with whom she worked closely . Roosevelt also had a close relationship with a New York State Police sergeant , Earl Miller , whom her husband had assigned as her bodyguard . Roosevelt was 44 years old when she met Miller , 32 , in 1929 . He became her friend as well as official escort , taught her different sports , such as diving and riding , and coached her in tennis . Biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook writes that Miller was Eleanor 's " first romantic involvement " in her middle years . Hazel Rowley concludes , " There is no doubt that Eleanor was in love with Earl for a time ... But they are most unlikely to have had an ' affair ' . " 
 Eleanor 's friendship with Miller happened at the same time as her husband 's rumored relationship with his secretary , Marguerite " Missy " LeHand . Smith writes , " remarkably , both ER and Franklin recognized , accepted , and encouraged the arrangement .... Eleanor and Franklin were strong @-@ willed people who cared greatly for each other 's happiness but realized their own inability to provide for it . " Eleanor and Miller 's relationship is said to have continued until her death in 1962 . They are thought to have corresponded daily , but all letters have been lost . According to rumor , the letters were anonymously purchased and destroyed , or locked away when she died . 
 In later years , Eleanor was said to have developed a romantic attachment to her physician , David <unk> , though it was likely limited to a deep friendship . 
 = = Public life before the White House = = 
 In the 1920 presidential election , Franklin was nominated as the Democratic vice presidential candidate with presidential candidate James M. Cox . Eleanor joined Franklin in touring the country , making her first campaign appearances . Cox and Roosevelt were defeated by Republican Warren G. Harding , who won with sixteen million votes to nine million . 
 Following the onset of Franklin 's polio in 1921 , Eleanor began serving as a stand @-@ in for her incapacitated husband , making public appearances on his behalf , often carefully coached by Louis Howe . She also started working with the Women 's Trade Union League ( <unk> ) , raising funds in support of the union 's goals : a 48 @-@ hour work week , minimum wage , and the abolition of child labor . Throughout the 1920s , Eleanor became increasingly influential as a leader in the New York State Democratic Party while Franklin used her contacts among Democratic women to strengthen his standing with them , winning their committed support for the future . In 1924 , she campaigned for Democrat Alfred E. Smith in his successful re @-@ election bid as governor of New York State against the Republican nominee and her first cousin Theodore Roosevelt , Jr . By 1928 , Eleanor was promoting Smith 's candidacy for president and Franklin 's nomination as the Democratic Party 's candidate for governor of New York , succeeding Smith . Although Smith lost the presidential race , Franklin won handily and the Roosevelts moved into the governor 's mansion in Albany , New York . During Franklin 's term as governor , Eleanor traveled widely in the state to make speeches and inspect state facilities on his behalf , reporting her findings to him at the end of each trip . 
 In 1927 , she joined friends Marion Dickerman and Nancy Cook in buying the Todhunter School for Girls , a finishing school which also offered college preparatory courses , in New York City . At the school , Roosevelt taught upper @-@ level courses in American literature and history , emphasizing independent thought , current events , and social engagement . She continued to teach three days a week while FDR served as governor , but was forced to leave teaching after his election as president . 
 = = First Lady of the United States ( 1933 – 1945 ) = = 
 Upon FDR 's inauguration on March 4 , 1933 , Eleanor became First Lady of the United States . Having known all of the twentieth century 's previous First Ladies , she was seriously depressed at having to assume the role , which had traditionally been restricted to domesticity and <unk> . Her immediate predecessor , Lou Henry Hoover , had ended her feminist activism on becoming First Lady , stating her intention to be only a " backdrop for Bertie . " Eleanor 's distress at these precedents was severe enough that Hickok subtitled her biography of Roosevelt " Reluctant First Lady " . 
 With support from Howe and Hickok , Roosevelt set out to redefine the position . In the process she became , according to her biographer Cook , " the most controversial First Lady in United States history " . With her husband 's strong support , despite criticism of them both , she continued with the active business and speaking agenda she had begun before becoming First Lady , in an era when few married women had careers . She was the first presidential spouse to hold press conferences and in 1940 became the first to speak at a national party convention . She also wrote a widely syndicated newspaper column , " My Day " , another first . In the first year of FDR 's tenure , determined to match his presidential salary , Eleanor earned $ 75 @,@ 000 from her lectures and writing , most of which she gave to charity . By 1941 , she was receiving lecture fees of $ 1 @,@ 000 . 
 Roosevelt maintained a heavy travel schedule in her twelve years in the White House , frequently making personal appearances at labor meetings to assure Depression @-@ era workers that the White House was mindful of their plight . In one widely circulated cartoon of the time from The New Yorker magazine ( June 3 , 1933 ) , an astonished coal miner , peering down a dark tunnel , says to a co @-@ worker " For gosh sakes , here comes Mrs. Roosevelt ! " 
 In early 1933 , the " Bonus Army " , a protest group of World War I veterans , marched on Washington for the second time in two years , calling for their veteran bonus certificates to be awarded early . The previous year , President Herbert Hoover had ordered them dispersed , and the US Army cavalry charged and bombarded the veterans with tear gas . This time , Eleanor Roosevelt visited the veterans at their muddy campsite , listening to their concerns and singing army songs with them . The meeting defused the tension between the veterans and the administration , and one of the marchers later commented , " Hoover sent the Army . Roosevelt sent his wife . " 
 = = = Arthurdale = = = 
 Roosevelt 's chief project during her husband 's first two terms was the establishment of a planned community in Arthurdale , West Virginia . On August 18 , 1933 , at Hickok 's urging , Roosevelt visited the families of homeless miners in Morgantown , West Virginia , who had been blacklisted following union activities . Deeply affected by the visit , Roosevelt proposed a resettlement community for the miners at Arthurdale , where they could make a living by subsistence farming , handicrafts , and a local manufacturing plant . She hoped the project could become a model for " a new kind of community " in the U.S. , in which workers would be better cared for . Her husband enthusiastically supported the project . 
 After an initial , disastrous experiment with prefab houses , construction began again in 1934 to Roosevelt 's specifications , this time with " every modern convenience " , including indoor plumbing and central steam heat . Families occupied the first fifty homes in June , and agreed to repay the government in thirty years ' time . Though Roosevelt had hoped for a racially mixed community , the miners insisted on limiting membership to white Christians . After losing a community vote , Roosevelt recommended the creation of other communities for the excluded black and Jewish miners . The experience motivated Roosevelt to become much more outspoken on the issue of racial discrimination . 
 Roosevelt remained a vigorous fundraiser for the community for several years , as well as spending most of her own income on the project . However , the project was criticized by both the political left and right . Conservatives condemned it as socialist and a " communist plot " , while Democratic members of Congress opposed government competition with private enterprise . Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes also opposed the project , citing its high per @-@ family cost . Arthurdale continued to sink as a government spending priority for the federal government until 1941 , when the U.S. sold off the last of its holdings in the community at a loss . 
 Later commentators generally described the Arthurdale experiment as a failure . Roosevelt herself was sharply discouraged by a 1940 visit in which she felt the town had become excessively dependent on outside assistance . However , the residents considered the town a " utopia " compared to their previous circumstances , and many were returned to economic self @-@ sufficiency . Roosevelt personally considered the project a success , later speaking of the improvements she saw in people 's lives there and stating , " I don 't know whether you think that is worth half a million dollars . But I do . " 
 = = = Civil rights activism = = = 
 Eleanor became an important connection for Franklin 's administration to the African @-@ American population during the segregation era . Despite the President 's desire to placate Southern sentiment , Eleanor was vocal in her support of the African @-@ American civil rights movement . After her experience with Arthurdale and her inspections of New Deal programs in Southern states , she concluded that New Deal programs were discriminating against African @-@ Americans , who received a disproportionately small share of relief moneys . Eleanor became one of the only voices in the Roosevelt White House insisting that benefits be equally extended to Americans of all races . 
 Eleanor also broke with precedent by inviting hundreds of African American guests to the White House . When the black singer Marian Anderson was denied the use of Washington 's Constitution Hall in 1939 by the Daughters of the American Revolution , Eleanor resigned from the group in protest and helped arrange another concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial . Roosevelt later presented Anderson to the King and Queen of the United Kingdom after Anderson performed at a White House dinner . Roosevelt also arranged the appointment of African @-@ American educator Mary McLeod Bethune , with whom she had struck up a friendship , as Director of the Division of Negro Affairs of the National Youth Administration . To avoid problems with the staff when Bethune would visit the White House , Eleanor would meet her at the gate , embrace her , and walk in with her arm @-@ in @-@ arm . 
 The significance of Eleanor Roosevelt is she helped reform social life . She was involved by being " the eyes and the ears " of the New Deal . She looked to the future and was committed to social reform . One of those programs helped working women receive better wages . The New Deal also placed women into less machine work and more white collar work . Women did not have to work in the factories making war supplies because men were coming home so they could take over the long days and nights women had been working to contribute to the war efforts . Roosevelt brought unprecedented activism and ability to the role of the 1st Lady . 
 Eleanor also lobbied behind the scenes for the 1934 Costigan @-@ Wagner Bill to make lynching a federal crime , including arranging a meeting between Franklin and NAACP president Walter Francis White . Fearing he would lose the votes of Southern congressional delegations for his legislative agenda , however , Franklin refused to publicly support the bill , which proved unable to pass the Senate . In 1942 , Eleanor worked with activist Pauli Murray to persuade Franklin to appeal on behalf of sharecropper Odell Waller , convicted of killing a white farmer during a fight ; though Franklin sent a letter to Virginia Governor Colgate Darden urging him to commute the sentence to life imprisonment , Waller was executed as scheduled . 
 Roosevelt 's support of African @-@ American rights made her an unpopular figure among whites in the South . Rumors spread of " Eleanor Clubs " formed by servants to oppose their employers and " Eleanor Tuesdays " on which African @-@ American men would knock down white women on the street , though no evidence has ever been found of either practice . When race riots broke out in Detroit in June 1943 , critics in both the North and South wrote that Roosevelt was to blame . At the same time , she grew so popular among African @-@ Americans , previously a reliable Republican voting bloc , that they became a consistent base of support for the Democratic Party . 
 Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 , Roosevelt spoke out against anti @-@ Japanese prejudice , warning against the " great hysteria against minority groups . " She also privately opposed her husband 's Executive Order 9066 , which forced Japanese @-@ Americans in many areas of the U.S. into internment camps . She was widely criticized for her defense of Japanese @-@ American citizens , including a call by the Los Angeles Times that she be " forced to retire from public life " over her stand on the issue . 
 = = = Use of media = = = 
 As an unprecedentedly outspoken First Lady , Roosevelt made far more use of the media than her predecessors had , holding 348 press conferences over the span of her husband 's 12 @-@ year presidency . Inspired by her relationship with Hickok , Roosevelt placed a ban on male reporters attending the press conferences , effectively forcing newspapers to keep female reporters on staff in order to cover them . She only relaxed the rule once , on her return from her 1943 Pacific trip . Because the Gridiron Club banned women from its annual Gridiron Dinner for journalists , Roosevelt hosted a competing event for female reporters at the White House , which she called " Gridiron Widows " <unk> was interviewed by many newspapers ; the New Orleans journalist Iris Kelso described Mrs. Roosevelt as her most interesting interviewee ever . 
 In February 1933 , just before Franklin assumed the presidency , Eleanor published an editorial in the Women 's Daily News conflicting so sharply with his intended public spending policies that he published a rejoinder in the following issue . On entering the White House , she signed a contract with the magazine Woman 's Home Companion to provide a monthly column , in which she answered mail sent to her by readers ; the feature was canceled in 1936 as another presidential election approached . She continued her articles in other venues , publishing more than sixty articles in national magazines during her tenure as First Lady . Eleanor also began a syndicated newspaper column , titled " My Day " , which appeared six days a week from 1936 to her death in 1962 . In the column , she wrote about her daily activities but also her humanitarian concerns . Beasley has argued that Roosevelt 's publications , which often dealt with women 's issues and invited reader responses , represented a conscious attempt to use journalism " to overcome social isolation " for women by making " public communication a two @-@ way channel " . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 On May 10 , 1940 , Germany invaded Belgium , Luxembourg , and the Netherlands , marking the end of the relatively conflict @-@ free " Phoney War " phase of World War II . As the U.S. began to move toward war footing , Roosevelt found herself again depressed , fearing that her role in fighting for domestic justice would become extraneous in a nation focused on foreign affairs . She briefly considered traveling to Europe to work with the Red Cross , but was dissuaded by presidential advisers who pointed out the consequences should the president 's wife be captured as a prisoner of war . She soon found other wartime causes to work on , however , beginning with a popular movement to allow the immigration of European refugee children . She also lobbied her husband to allow greater immigration of groups persecuted by the Nazis , including Jews , but fears of fifth columnists caused Franklin to restrict immigration rather than expanding it . Eleanor successfully secured political refugee status for eighty @-@ three Jewish refugees from the S.S. <unk> in August 1940 , but was refused on many other occasions . Her son James later wrote that " her deepest regret at the end of her life " was that she had not forced Franklin to accept more refugees from Nazism during the war . 
 Eleanor was also active on the home front . Beginning in 1941 , she co @-@ chaired the Office of Civilian Defense ( OCD ) with New York City Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia , working to give civilian volunteers expanded roles in war preparations . She soon found herself in a power struggle with LaGuardia , who preferred to focus on narrower aspects of defense , while she saw solutions to broader social problems as equally important to the war effort . Though LaGuardia resigned from the OCD in December 1941 , Eleanor was forced to resign following anger in the House of Representatives over high salaries for several OCD appointments , including two of her close friends . 
 In October 1942 , Roosevelt toured England , visiting with American troops and inspecting British forces . Her visits drew enormous crowds and received almost unanimously favorable press in both England and America . In August 1943 , she visited American troops in the South Pacific on a morale @-@ building tour , of which Admiral William Halsey , Jr. later said , " she alone accomplished more good than any other person , or any groups of civilians , who had passed through my area . " For her part , Roosevelt was left shaken and deeply depressed by seeing the war 's carnage . A number of Congressional Republicans criticized her for using scarce wartime resources for her trip , prompting Franklin to suggest that she take a break from traveling . 
 Roosevelt supported increased roles for women and African @-@ Americans in the war effort , and began to advocate for factory jobs to be given to women a year before it became a widespread practice . In 1942 , she urged women of all social backgrounds to learn trades , saying : " if I were of a debutante age I would go into a factory – any factory where I could learn a skill and be useful . " Learning of the high rate of absenteeism among working mothers , she also campaigned for government @-@ sponsored day care . She notably supported the Tuskegee Airmen in their successful effort to become the first black combat pilots , visiting the Tuskegee Air Corps Advanced Flying School in Alabama . At her request , she flew with the Chief Flight Instructor Charles " Chief " Alfred Anderson for more than an hour , which had great symbolic value and brought visibility to Tuskegee 's pilot training program . 
 After the war , Eleanor was a strong proponent of the Morgenthau Plan to de @-@ industrialize Germany in the postwar period . In 1946 , she attended the National Conference on the German Problem in New York , which issued a statement that " any plans to resurrect the economic and political power of Germany " would be dangerous to international security . 
 = = Years after the White House = = 
 Franklin died on April 12 , 1945 after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage at Warm Springs , Georgia . Eleanor later learned that FDR 's mistress , Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd , had been with him when he died , a discovery made more bitter by learning that her daughter Anna had also been aware of the ongoing friendship between the president and Rutherfurd . After the funeral , Eleanor packed and moved out of the White House , returning to Val @-@ Kill . In instructions left for Eleanor in the event of his death , Franklin proposed turning over Hyde Park to the federal government as a museum , and she spent the following months cataloging the estate and arranging the transfer . After FDR 's death , Eleanor moved into an apartment at 29 Washington Square West in Greenwich Village . In 1950 , she rented suites at The Park Sheraton Hotel ( 202 West 56th Street ) . She lived here until 1953 when she moved to 211 East 62nd Street . When that lease expired in 1958 , she returned to The Park Sheraton as she waited for the house she purchased with Edna and David <unk> at 55 East 74th Street to be renovated . The Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum opened on April 12 , 1946 , setting a precedent for future presidential libraries . 
 = = = United Nations = = = 
 In December 1945 , President Harry S. Truman appointed Eleanor as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly . In April 1946 , she became the first chairperson of the preliminary United Nations Commission on Human Rights . Eleanor remained chairperson when the Commission was established on a permanent basis in January 1947 . She played an instrumental role , along with René Cassin , John Peters Humphrey and others , in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ( UDHR ) . 
 Eleanor spoke in favor of the Declaration , calling it " the international Magna Carta of all men everywhere " in a speech on the night of September 28 , 1948 . The Declaration was adopted by the General Assembly on December 10 , 1948 . The vote was unanimous , with eight abstentions : six Soviet Bloc countries as well as South Africa and Saudi Arabia . Roosevelt attributed the abstention of the Soviet bloc nations to Article 13 , which provided the right of citizens to leave their countries . 
 Roosevelt also served as the first United States Representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and stayed on at that position until 1953 , even after stepping down as chair of the Commission in 1951 . The UN posthumously awarded her one of its first Human Rights Prizes in 1968 in recognition of her work . 
 = = = Postwar politics = = = 
 In the late 1940s , Democrats in New York and throughout the country courted Roosevelt for political office . 
 At first I was surprised that anyone should think that I would want to run for office , or that I was fitted to hold office . Then I realized that some people felt that I must have learned something from my husband in all the years that he was in public life ! They also knew that I had stressed the fact that women should accept responsibility as citizens . I heard that I was being offered the nomination for governor or for the United States Senate in my own state , and even for Vice President . And some particularly humorous souls wrote in and suggested that I run as the first woman President of the United States ! The simple truth is that I have had my fill of public life of the more or less stereotyped kind . 
 Catholics comprised a major element of the Democratic Party in New York City . She supported reformers trying to overthrow the Irish machine Tammany Hall , and some Catholics called her anti @-@ Catholic . In July 1949 , Roosevelt had a bitter public disagreement with Cardinal Francis Spellman , the Archbishop of New York , over federal funding for parochial schools . Spellman said she was anti @-@ Catholic , and supporters of both took sides in a battle that drew national attention and is " still remembered for its vehemence and hostility . " 
 In 1954 , Tammany Hall boss Carmine DeSapio led the effort to defeat Eleanor 's son , Franklin Delano Roosevelt , Jr . , in the election for New York Attorney General . Eleanor grew increasingly disgusted with DeSapio 's political conduct through the rest of the 1950s . Eventually , she would join with her old friends Herbert Lehman and Thomas Finletter to form the New York Committee for Democratic Voters , a group dedicated to opposing DeSapio 's reincarnated Tammany Hall . Their efforts were eventually successful , and DeSapio was forced to relinquish power in 1961 . 
 When President Truman backed New York Governor W. Averell Harriman , a close associate of DeSapio , for the 1952 Democratic presidential nomination , Roosevelt was disappointed . She supported Adlai Stevenson for president in 1952 and 1956 and urged his renomination in 1960 . She resigned from her UN post in 1953 , when Dwight D. Eisenhower became President . Although Roosevelt had reservations about John F. Kennedy for his failure to condemn McCarthyism , she supported him for president against Richard Nixon . Kennedy later reappointed her to the United Nations , where she served again from 1961 to 1962 , and to the National Advisory Committee of the Peace Corps . 
 By the 1950s , Roosevelt 's international role as spokesperson for women led her to stop publicly criticizing the Equal Rights Amendment ( ERA ) , although she never supported it . In 1961 , President Kennedy 's undersecretary of labor , Esther Peterson proposed a new Presidential Commission on the Status of Women . Kennedy appointed Roosevelt to chair the commission , with Peterson as director ; she died just before the commission issued its report . It concluded that female equality was best achieved by recognition of gender differences and needs , and not by an Equal Rights Amendment . 
 Throughout the 1950s , Roosevelt embarked on countless national and international speaking engagements ; continued to pen her newspaper column ; and made appearances on television and radio broadcasts . She averaged one hundred fifty lectures a year throughout the fifties , many devoted to her activism on behalf of the United Nations . In 1961 , all volumes of Roosevelt 's autobiography , which she had begun writing in 1937 , were compiled into The Autobiography of Eleanor Roosevelt ( Harper & Brothers , ISBN 0 @-@ 306 @-@ <unk> @-@ X ) . 
 Roosevelt received thirty @-@ five honorary degrees , thirteen of which were from universities outside the United States . Her 1948 speech " The Struggle for Human Rights " was listed as # 55 in American Rhetoric 's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century ( listed by rank ) , and her 1948 speech " On the Adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights " was # 98 on that same list . 
 = = Death and tributes = = 
 In April 1960 , Roosevelt was diagnosed with aplastic anemia soon after being struck by a car in New York City .

 = Battle of Borodino = 
 The Battle of Borodino [ <unk> ] ( Russian : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ; French : Bataille de la <unk> ) , fought on September 7 , 1812 , was a battle fought in the Napoleonic Wars during the French invasion of Russia . The fighting involved around 250 @,@ 000 troops and left at least 70 @,@ 000 casualties , making Borodino the deadliest day of the Napoleonic Wars . Napoleon 's Grande Armée launched an attack against the Russian army , driving it back from its initial positions but failing to gain a decisive victory . Both armies were exhausted after the battle and the Russians withdrew from the field the following day . Borodino represented the last Russian effort at stopping the French advance on Moscow , which fell a week later . However , the French had no clear way of forcing Czar Alexander to capitulate because the Russian army was not decisively defeated , resulting in the ultimate defeat of the French invasion following the retreat from Moscow in October . 
 After a series of Russian retreats at the beginning of the campaign , the nobility grew alarmed about the advancing French troops and forced the Czar to dismiss the army 's commander , Barclay de Tolly . Mikhail Kutuzov was appointed as his replacement . In a final attempt to save Moscow , the Russians made a stand near the village of Borodino , west of the town of Mozhaysk . They fortified their positions and waited for the French to attack . The Russian right wing occupied ideal defensive terrain , so the French tried to press the Russian left for much of the battle . The highlight of the fighting became the bloody struggle for the large Raevsky redoubt near the village of Borodino . The French managed to capture this redoubt late into the day , gradually forcing the rest of the Russian army to pull back as well . The Russians suffered terrible casualties during the fighting , losing over a third of their army . French losses were also heavy , exacerbating the logistical difficulties that Napoleon encountered in the campaign . 
 The exhaustion of the French forces , and the lack of information on the condition of the Russian army , persuaded Napoleon to remain on the battlefield with his army instead of ordering the kind of vigorous pursuit reminiscent of previous campaigns . Napoleon 's Imperial Guard , the only unit on the battlefield that saw no fighting , was available to swing into action at a moment 's notice . In refusing to commit the Guard , some historians believe , he lost his one chance to destroy the Russian army and to win the campaign . 
 The capture of Moscow proved a pyrrhic victory since the Russians had no intention of negotiating with Napoleon for peace . The French evacuated Russia 's spiritual capital in October and conducted a difficult retreat that only ended in December , by which point the remainder of the Grande Armée had largely unraveled . Historical reports of the battle differed significantly depending on whether they originated from supporters of the French or Russian side . Factional fighting among senior officers within each army also led to conflicting accounts and disagreements over the roles of particular officers . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Napoleon 's invasion of Russia = = = 
 The French Grande Armée began its invasion of Russia on June 16 , 1812 . In response , Emperor Alexander I proclaimed a " Patriotic War " and prepared to face the French . According to the plan of German general Karl Ludwig von Phull , the Russian troops under the command of Count Michael Barclay de Tolly had to face the Grande Armée in the Vilnius region ; the remaining troops under general Pyotr Bagration would launch an attack to the French southern flank and rear . However , Phull 's plan soon proved to be a fatal mistake , as the enormous Grande Armée was more than enough to separate and crush both Russian armies at the same time . Furthermore , the participation of Tsar Alexander I as commander caused more chaos in the Russian army . The Russian forces which were massed along the Polish frontier were obliged to fall back in the face of the swift French advance . 
 Napoleon advanced from Vitebsk , hoping to catch the Russian Army in the open where he could annihilate it . The French army was not positioned well for an extended overland campaign ; it was 925 km ( 575 mi ) from its nearest supply base at Kovno ( Kaunas ) . French supply lines were vulnerable and Cossacks , light cavalry , guerrilla forces and even French deserters attacked and seriously depleted French supply columns . The central French force under Napoleon 's direct command had crossed the Niemen with 286 @,@ 000 men but by the time of the battle was reduced to 161 @,@ 475 , mostly through starvation and disease . Nonetheless , the prospect of a decisive battle lured Napoleon deeper into Russia and further stretched his supply lines . 
 Infighting between Barclay 's subordinates repeatedly prevented the Russian commander from committing his forces to battle . Barclay 's fellow generals and the Russian court viewed the constant retreat as a reluctance to fight ; consequently , he was removed from command and replaced by Prince Mikhail Kutuzov on August 29 , 1812 . Even though the 67 @-@ year @-@ old General Kutuzov was not seen by his contemporaries as the equal of Napoleon , he possessed the ability to muster a good defence . He was favoured over Barclay because he was Russian whereas Barclay was of Scottish descent and officers subordinate to Barclay could accept Kutuzov , thereby uniting the army . On 18 August Kutuzov arrived at <unk> to greet the army . 
 After taking over the army , Kutuzov organized a strong rearguard under the command of General <unk> and then ordered the army to prepare for battle . Kutuzov understood that Barclay 's decision to retreat was correct but the Russian troops could not accept further retreat . A battle had to occur in order to preserve the morale of the soldiers . The new commander had still not managed to establish a defensive position when the armies were within 125 kilometres ( 78 mi ) of Moscow . He then ordered another retreat to <unk> ( Gagarin ) on August 30 ; by that time the ratio of French to Russian forces had shrunk from 3 : 1 to 5 : 4 . The time to fight had arrived . 
 A defensive line was established in the best available position before Moscow near the village of Borodino . Although the Borodino field was too open and had too few natural obstacles to protect the Russian center and the left flank , it was chosen due to the protection provided by the Kolocha river , because it blocked both Smolensk – Moscow roads and because there were simply no better locations . Starting on September 3 , Kutuzov strengthened the line with earthworks , including the Raevski Redoubt in the center @-@ right of the line and three open , arrow @-@ shaped " Bagration flèches " ( named after Pyotr Bagration ) on the left . 
 = = = Battle of Shevardino Redoubt = = = 
 The initial Russian position , which stretched south of the new Smolensk Highway ( Napoleon 's expected route of advance ) , was anchored on its left by a pentagonal earthwork redoubt erected on a mound near the village of Shevardino . The Russian generals soon realized that their left wing was too exposed and vulnerable . So the Russian line was moved back from this position , but the Redoubt remained manned , Kutuzov stating that the fortification was manned simply to delay the advance of the French forces . Historian Dmitry Buturlin reports that it was used as an observation point to determine the course of the French advance . Historians <unk> and <unk> , and many others , reported it was used as a fortification to threaten the French right flank , despite being beyond effective reach of guns of the period . The Chief of Staff of the Russian 1st Army , Aleksey Petrovich Yermolov , related in his memoirs that the Russian left was shifting position when the French Army arrived sooner than expected ; thus the Battle of Shevardino became a delaying effort to shield the redeployment of the Russian left . The construction of the redoubt and its purpose is still disputed by historians to this day . 
 The conflict began on September 5 when King Joachim Murat 's French forces met Konovnitzyn 's Russians in a massive cavalry clash , the Russians eventually retreating to the <unk> Cloister when their flank was threatened . Fighting resumed the next day but Konovnitzyn again retreated when Viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais ' Fourth Corps arrived , threatening his flank . The Russians withdrew to the Shevardino Redoubt , where a pitched battle ensued . King Murat led Nansouty 's First Cavalry Corps and Montbrun 's Second Cavalry Corps , supported by Compans 's Division of Louis Nicolas Davout 's First Infantry Corps against the redoubt . Simultaneously , Prince Josef Poniatowski 's infantry attacked the position from the south . Fighting was heavy and very fierce , as the Russians refused to retreat until Kutuzov personally ordered them to do so . The French captured the redoubt , at a cost of 4 @,@ 000 – 5 @,@ 000 French and 6 @,@ 000 Russian casualties . The small redoubt was destroyed and covered by the dead and dying of both sides . 
 The unexpected French advance from the west and the fall of the Shevardino redoubt threw the Russian formation into disarray . Since the left flank of their defensive position had collapsed , Russian forces withdrew to the east , constructing a makeshift position centered around the village of Utitsa . The left flank of the Russian position was thus ripe for a flanking attack . 
 = = Opposing forces = = 
 A series of reforms to the Russian army had begun in 1802 , creating regiments of three battalions , each battalion having four companies . The defeats of Austerlitz , Eylau , and Friedland led to important additional reforms , though continuous fighting in the course of three wars with France , two with Sweden , and two with the Ottoman Empire had not allowed time for these to be fully implemented and absorbed . A divisional system was introduced in 1806 , and corps were established in 1812 . Prussian influence may be seen in the organizational setup . By the time of Borodino the Russian Army had changed greatly from the force which met the French in 1805 – 1807 . 
 Russian forces present at the battle included 180 infantry battalions , 164 cavalry squadrons , 20 Cossack regiments , and 55 artillery batteries ( 637 artillery pieces ) . In total , the Russians fielded 155 @,@ 200 troops . There were 10 @,@ 000 Cossacks as well as 33 @,@ 000 Russian militiamen in the area who did not participate in the battle . After the battle the militia units were broken up to provide reinforcements to depleted regular infantry battalions . Of the 637 Russian artillery pieces , 300 were held in reserve and many of these were never committed to the battle . 
 According to Historian Alexander <unk> , the French Army remained the finest army of its day by a good margin . It had been the legacy of the French King and its fusion with the formations of the French revolution and Napoleon 's reforms had transformed it into a military machine that had dominated Europe since 1805 . Each corps of the French Army was in fact its own mini @-@ army capable of independent action . 
 French forces included 214 battalions of infantry , 317 squadrons of cavalry and 587 artillery pieces totaling of 128 @,@ 000 troops . However , the French Imperial Guard , which consisted of 30 infantry battalions , 27 cavalry squadrons and 109 artillery pieces — a total of 18 @,@ 500 troops — was also never committed to action . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = Position = = = 
 The ground taken up by the left wing presented no particular advantages . Some hillocks with a gentle slope , and perhaps twenty feet high , together with strips of shrubby wood , formed so confused a whole , that it was difficult to pronounce which party would have the advantage of the ground . Thus , the best side of the position , the right wing , could be of no avail to redeem the defects of the left . The whole position too strongly indicated the left flank to the French as the object of the operation , to admit to their forces being attracted to the right . 
 The Russian position at Borodino consisted of a series of disconnected earthworks running in an arc from the Moskva River on the right , along its tributary , the Kolocha ( whose steep banks added to the defense ) , and towards the village of Utitsa on the left . Thick woods interspersed along the Russian left and center ( on the French side of the Kolocha ) made the deployment and control of French forces difficult , aiding the defenders . The Russian center was defended by the Raevsky Redoubt , a massive open @-@ backed earthwork mounting 19 12 @-@ pounder cannons which had a clear field of fire all the way to the banks of the Kolocha stream . 
 Kutuzov was very strongly concerned that the French might take the New Smolensk Road around his positions and on to Moscow so placed the more powerful 1st Army under Barclay on the right , in positions which were already strong and virtually unassailable by the French . The 2nd Army under Bagration was expected to hold the left . The fall of Shevardino unanchored the Russian left flank but Kutuzov did nothing to change these initial dispositions despite the repeated pleas of his generals to redeploy their forces . Thus , when the action began and became a defensive rather than an offensive battle for the Russians , their heavy preponderance in artillery was wasted on a right wing that would never be attacked , while the French artillery did much to help win the battle . Toll and others would make attempts to cover up their mistakes in this deployment and later attempts by historians would compound the issue . Indeed , Clausewitz too complained about Toll 's dispositions being so narrow and deep that needless losses were incurred from artillery fire . The Russian position therefore was just about 8 kilometres ( 5 mi ) long with about 80 @,@ 000 of the 1st Army on the right and 34 @,@ 000 of the 2nd Army on the left . 
 = = = Bagration 's flèches = = = 
 The first area of operations was on the Bagration flèches , as had been predicted by both Barclay de Tolly and Bagration . Napoleon , in command of the French forces , made errors similar to those of his Russian adversary , deploying his forces inefficiently and failing to exploit the weaknesses in the Russian line . Despite Marshal Davout 's suggestion of a maneuver to outflank the weak Russian left , the Emperor instead ordered Davout 's First Corps to move directly forward into the teeth of the defense , while the flanking maneuver was left to the weak Fifth Corps of Prince Poniatowski . The initial French attack was aimed at seizing the three Russian positions collectively known as the Bagration flèches , four arrow @-@ head shaped , open @-@ backed earthworks which arced out to the left en <unk> in front of the Kolocha stream . These positions helped support the Russian left , which had no terrain advantages . There was much to be desired in the construction of the flèches , one officer noting that the ditches were much too shallow , the embrasures open to the ground , making them easy to enter , and that they were much too wide exposing infantry inside them . The flèches were supported by artillery from the village of <unk> , whose elevation dominated the other side of the Kolocha . 
 The battle began at 06 : 00 with the opening of the 102 @-@ gun French grand battery against the Russian center . Davout sent Compans 's Division against the southernmost of the flèches , with Dessaix 's Division echeloned out to the left . When Compans exited the woods on the far bank of the Kolocha , he was hit by massed Russian cannon fire ; both Compans and Dessaix were wounded , but the French continued their assault . Davout , seeing the confusion , personally led the 57th Line Regiment ( Le Terrible ) forward until he had his horse shot from under him ; he fell so hard that General Sorbier reported him as dead . General Rapp arrived to replace him , only to find Davout alive and leading the 57th forward again . Rapp then led the 61st Line Regiment forward when he was wounded ( for the 22nd time in his career ) . 
 By 07 : 30 , Davout had gained control of the three flèches . Prince Bagration quickly led a counterattack that threw the French out of the positions , only to have Marshal Michel Ney lead a charge by the 24th Regiment that retook them . Although not enamoured of Barclay , Bagration turned to him for aid , ignoring Kutuzov altogether ; Barclay , to his credit , responded quickly , sending three guard regiments , eight grenadier battalions , and twenty @-@ four 12 @-@ pounder cannon at their best pace to bolster <unk> . Colonel Toll and Kutuzov moved the Guard Reserve units forward as early as 09 : 00 hours . 
 During the confused fighting , French and Russian units moved forward into impenetrable smoke and were smashed by artillery and musketry fire that was horrendous even by Napoleonic standards . Infantry and cavalrymen had difficulty maneuvering over the heaps of corpses and masses of wounded . Murat advanced with his cavalry around the flèches to attack Bagration 's infantry , but was confronted by Duka 's 2nd Cuirassier Division supported by <unk> 's infantry . The French carried out seven assaults against the flèches and each time were beaten back in fierce close combat . Bagration in some instances was personally leading counterattacks , and in a final attempt to push the French completely back he got hit in the leg by cannonball splinters somewhere around 11 : 00 hours . He insisted on staying on the field to observe Duka 's decisive cavalry attack . This counter punch drove Murat to seek the cover of allied <unk> infantry . Barclay 's reinforcements , however , were sent into the fray only to be torn to pieces by French artillery , leaving Friant 's Division in control of the Russian forward position at 11 : 30 . Dust , smoke , confusion , and exhaustion all combined to keep the French commanders on the field ( Davout , Ney , and Murat ) from comprehending that all the Russians before them had fallen back , were in confusion , and ripe for the taking . The 2nd Army 's command structure fell apart as Bagration was evacuated from the battlefield and the report of him being hit quickly spread and caused morale collapse . Napoleon , who had been sick with a cold and was too far from the action to really observe what was going on , refused to send his subordinates reinforcements ; he was hesitant to release his last reserve , the Imperial Guard , so far from France . 
 = = = First attacks on the Raevsky redoubt = = = 
 Prince Eugène de Beauharnais advanced his corps against Borodino , rushing the village and capturing it from the Russian Guard Jägers . However , the advancing columns rapidly lost their cohesion ; shortly after clearing Borodino , they faced fresh Russian assault columns and retreated back to the village . General <unk> was posted to Borodino to prevent the Russians retaking it . Morand 's division then crossed to the north side of the <unk> stream , while the remainder of Eugène 's forces crossed three bridges across the Kolocha to the south , placing them on the same side of the stream as the Russians . He then deployed most of his artillery and began to push the Russians back toward the Raevsky redoubt . <unk> and Morand 's divisions then advanced together with furious artillery support . The redoubt changed hands as Barclay was forced to personally rally <unk> 's routed regiment . Kutuzov then ordered Yermolov to take action ; the general brought forward three horse artillery batteries that began to blast the open @-@ ended redoubt , while the 3rd Battalion of the Ufa Regiment and two Jäger regiments brought up by Barclay rushed in with the bayonet to eliminate Bonami 's Brigade . The Russian reinforcements ' assault returned the redoubt to Russian control . 
 Eugène 's artillery continued to pound Russian support columns , while Marshals Ney and Davout set up a crossfire with artillery positioned on the <unk> heights . Barclay countered by moving the Prussian General Eugen over to the right to support <unk> in his defense of the redoubt . The French responded to this move by sending forward General Sorbier , commander of the Imperial Guard artillery . Sorbier brought forth 36 artillery pieces from the Imperial Guard Artillery Park and also took command of 49 horse artillery pieces from Nansouty 's Ist Cavalry Corps and La Tour Maubourg 's IV Cavalry Corps , as well as of Viceroy Eugène 's own artillery , opening up a massive artillery barrage . When Barclay brought up troops against an attacking French brigade , he described it as " a walk into Hell " . During the height of the battle , Kutuzov 's subordinates were making all of the decisions for him ; according to Colonel Karl von Clausewitz , famous for his work On War , the Russian commander " seemed to be in a trance . " With the death of General <unk> , Chief of Artillery , most of the Russian cannon sat useless on the heights to the rear and were never ordered into battle , while the French artillery wreaked havoc on the Russians . 
 = = = The Cossack raid on the northern flank = = = 
 On the morning of the battle at around 07 : 30 , patrols of Don Cossacks from <unk> Platov 's <unk> had discovered a ford across the Kolocha river , on the extreme Russian right ( northern ) flank . Seeing that the ground in front of them was clear of enemy forces , Platov saw an opportunity to go around the French left flank and into the enemy 's rear . He at once sent one of his aides to ask for permission from Kutuzov for such an operation . Platov 's aide was lucky enough to encounter Colonel von Toll , an enterprising member of Kutuzov 's staff , who suggested that General Uvarov 's Ist Cavalry Corps be added to the operation and at once volunteered to present the plan to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief . Together , they went to see Kutuzov , who nonchalantly gave his permission . There was however no clear plan and no objectives had been drawn up , the whole manoeuvre being interpreted by both Kutuzov and Uvarov as a feint . Uvarov and Platov thus set off , having just around 8000 cavalrymen and 12 guns in total , and no infantry support . As Uvarov moved southwest and south and Platov moved west , they eventually arrived in the undefended rear of Viceroy Eugène 's IV Corps . This was towards midday , just as the Viceroy was getting his orders to conduct another assault on the Raevski redoubt . The sudden appearance of masses of enemy cavalry so close to the supply train and to the Emperor 's Headquarters caused panic and consternation and prompted Eugène to immediately cancel his attack and pull back his entire Corps westwards to deal with this alarming situation . Meanwhile , the two Russian cavalry commanders tried to break what French infantry they could find in the vicinity , but , having no infantry of their own , the poorly coordinated Russian attacks came to nothing . Unable to achieve much else , Platov and Uvarov moved back to their own lines and the action was perceived as a failure by both Kutuzov and the Russian General Staff . As it turned out , however , the action had the utmost importance in the outcome of the battle , as it delayed the attack of the IV Corps on the Raevski redoubt for a critical two hours . During these two hours , the Russians were able to reassess the situation , realize the terrible state of Bagration 's 2nd Army and send reinforcements to the front line . Meanwhile , the retreat of Viceroy Eugène 's Corps had left Montbrun 's II French Cavalry Corps to fill the gap under the most murderous fire , which used and demoralized these cavalrymen , greatly reducing their combat effectiveness . The delay contradicted a military principle the Emperor had stated many times : " Ground I may recover , time never . " Also , the Cossacks ' raid contributed to Napoleon 's later decision not to commit his Imperial Guard to battle . 
 = = = Final attack on Raevsky redoubt = = = 
 At 14 : 00 , Napoleon renewed the assault against the redoubt , as <unk> 's , Morand 's , and Gérard 's divisions launched a massive frontal attack , with Chastel 's light cavalry division on their left and the II Reserve Cavalry Corps on their right ; At the Russian sides , 24th Division of <unk> was sent into the battle . The Russian fought bravely under <unk> 's motto : " Brethren , behind us is Moscow ! " But the French troops approached too close for the cannons to fire , and the cannoneers had to use everything to fight against their foes . General Caulaincourt ordered <unk> 's cuirassier division to lead the assault . Barclay watched Eugène 's assault preparations and countered it , moving his forces against it . The French artillery , however , began bombarding the assembling force even as it gathered . Caulaincourt led the attack of <unk> 's cuirassiers into the opening at the back of the redoubt and met his death as the charge was stopped cold by Russian musketry . General Thielmann then led eight Saxon and two Polish cavalry squadrons against the back of the redoubt , while officers and sergeants of his command actually forced their horses through the redoubt 's embrasures , sowing confusion and allowing the French cavalry and infantry to take the position . The battle had all but ended , with both sides so exhausted that only the artillery was still at work . At 15 : 30 , the Raevsky redoubt fell with most of the 24th Division 's troops . All the Russian cannoneers in Raevsky also died right next to their cannons , and General <unk> was captured by the French . But , besides the dead Russian troops were the corpses of 1000 Caulaincourt 's cuirassiers , including Caulaincourt himself . 
 However , the fall of the Raevsky redoubt did not have much meaning . The Russian troops successfully moved to the rear without being destroyed ( despite suffering heavy losses ) . So , in spite of losing some areas in the battlefield , the Russian formation was prevented from collapsing . On the French side , the gain of the Raevsky redoubt cost them large casualties and , after that , Napoleon himself ordered his troops to retreat to the starting line . The Russians then reoccupied their previous positions . 
 = = = Utitsa = = = 
 The third area of operations was around the village of Utitsa . The village was at the southern end of the Russian positions and lay along the old Smolensk road . It was rightly perceived as a potential weak point in the defense as a march along the road could turn the entire position at Borodino . Despite such concerns the area was a tangle of rough country thickly covered in heavy brush well suited for deploying light infantry . The forest was dense , the ground marshy and Russian Jaeger were deployed there in some numbers . Russian General Nikolay Tuchkov had some 23 @,@ 000 troops but half were untrained <unk> ( militia ) armed only with pikes and axes and not ready for deployment . Poniatowski had about 10 @,@ 000 men all trained and very eager to fight but his first attempt did not go well . It was at once realized the massed troops and artillery could not move through the forest against Jaeger opposition so had to reverse to Yelnya and then move eastward . Tuchkov had deployed his 1st Grenadier Division in line backing it with the 3rd division in battalion columns . Some four regiments were called away to help defend the redoubts that were under attack and another 2 Jaeger regiments were deployed in the Utitsa woods , weakening the position . The Polish contingent contested for the village of Utitsa , effecting its capture with their first attempt but Tuchkov had ejected the French forces by 08 : 00 . General Jean @-@ <unk> Junot led the <unk> to join the attack and again captured Utitsa , which however was set on fire by the departing Russians . After the village 's capture , Russians and Poles continued to skirmish and cannonade for the rest of the day without much progress . The heavy undergrowth greatly hindered Poniatowski 's efforts but eventually he came near to cutting off Tuchkov from the rest of the Russian forces . General Barclay sent help in the form of Karl Gustav von <unk> with Konovnitzyn in support . Any hope of real progress by the Poles was then lost .

 Towards 15 : 00 , after hours of heroic and stoic resistance , the Russian army was in dire straits , but the no less valiant French forces were exhausted and had neither the necessary stamina nor the necessary will to carry out another assault of the enemy line . At this crucial juncture , Murat 's chief of staff , General Augustin Daniel Belliard rode straight to the Emperor 's Headquarters and , according to General Ségur who wrote an account of the campaign , told him that the Russian line had been breached , that the road to Mozhaysk , behind the Russian line , was visible through the gaping hole the French attack had pierced , that an enormous crowd of runaways and vehicles were hastily retreating , and that a final push would be enough to decide the fate of the Russian army and of the war . Generals Daru , Dumas and Marshal Louis Alexandre Berthier also joined in and told the Emperor that everyone thought the time had come for the Guard to be committed to battle . Given the ferocity of the Russian defense , everyone was aware that such a move would cost the lives of thousands of Guardsmen , but it was thought that the presence of this prestigious unit would bolster the morale of the entire army for a final decisive push . A notable exception was Marshal Bessières , commander of the Guard cavalry , who was one of the very few senior generals to strongly advise against the intervention of the Guard . As the general staff were discussing the matter , general Rapp , a senior aide @-@ de @-@ camp to the Emperor , was being brought from the field of battle , having been wounded in action . He immediately recommended to the Emperor that the Guard be deployed for action at which the Emperor is said to have retorted : " I will most definitely not ; I do not want to have it blown up . I am certain of winning the battle without its intervention . " Determined not to commit this valuable final reserve so far away from France , Napoleon rejected another such request , this time from Marshal Ney . Instead , he called the commander of the " Young Guard " , Marshal Mortier and instructed him to guard the field of battle without moving forward or backward , while at the same time unleashing a massive cannonade with his 400 guns .

 Napoleon went forward to see the situation from the former Russian front lines shortly after the redoubts had been taken . The Russians had moved to the next ridge @-@ line in much disarray ; however , that disarray was not seen from that distance with the dust and haze raised by an army on the move . Kutuzov ordered the Russian Guard to hold the line and so it did . All of the artillery that the French army had was not enough to move it . Those compact squares made good artillery targets and the Russian Guard stood in place from 4pm to 6pm unmoving under its fire resulting in huge casualties . All he could see were masses of troops in the distance and thus nothing more was attempted . Neither the attack , which relied on brute force , nor the refusal to use the Guard to finish the day 's work showed any brilliance on Napoleon 's part . 
 Only the misplacement of Russian forces by Kutuzov over both Bagration 's and Barclay 's protest prevented the ruin of the French army that day , both the Prussian Staff Officer Karl von Clausewitz , the historian and future author of On War , and Alexander I of Russia noting that the poor positioning of troops in particular had hobbled the defense . Barclay communicated with Kutuzov in order to receive further instructions . According to Ludwig von Wolzogen ( in an account dripping with sarcasm ) , the commander was found a half @-@ hour away on the road to Moscow , encamped with an entourage of young nobles and grandly pronouncing he would drive Napoleon off the next day . Despite his bluster , Kutuzov knew from dispatches that his army had been too badly hurt to fight a continuing action the following day . He knew exactly what he was doing : by fighting the pitched battle , he could now retreat with the Russian army still intact , lead its recovery , and force the weakened French forces to move even further from their bases of supply . The dénouement became a textbook example of what a hold logistics placed upon an army far from its center of supply . On September 8 , the Russian army moved away from the battlefield in twin columns to <unk> , allowing Napoleon to occupy Moscow and await for 5 weeks a Russian surrender that would never come . 
 Kutuzov would proclaim over the course of several days that the Russian Army would fight again before the wall of Moscow . In fact , a site was chosen near <unk> Gora within a few miles of Moscow as a battle site . However , the Russian Army had not received enough reinforcements , and it was too risky to cling to Moscow at all cost . Kutuzov understood that the Russian people never wanted to abandon Moscow , the city which was regarded as Russia 's " second capital " ; however he also believed that the Russian Army did not have enough force to protect that city . Kutuzov then called for a council of war at the night of September 1 at Fili village . In a heated debate that split five to four to give battle , Kutuzov , after listening to each General , endorsed retreat . Thus passed the last chance of battle before Moscow was taken . 
 = = = Historiography = = = 
 It is not unusual for a pivotal battle of this era to be difficult to document . Similar difficulties exist with the Battle of Waterloo or battles of the War of 1812 in North America , while the Battle of Borodino offers its own particular challenges to accuracy . Modern historian Adam Zamoyski noted : " No other campaign in history has been subjected to such overtly political uses . " 
 Personal accounts of the battle frequently magnified an individual 's own role or minimised those of rivals . The politics of the time were complex and complicated by ethnic divisions between native Russian nobility and those having second and third @-@ generation German descent , leading to rivalry for positions in command of the army . Not only does a historian have to deal with the normal problem of a veteran looking back and recalling events as he or she would have liked them to have been , but in some cases outright malice was involved . Nor was this strictly a Russian event , as bickering and sabotage was not in the least unknown amongst the French marshals and their reporting generals . To " lie like a bulletin " was not just a French affair either , with Kutuzov in particular promoting an early form of misinformation that has continued to this day . Further distortions occurred during the Soviet years , when an adherence to a " formula " was the expectation during the Stalin years and for some time after that . The over @-@ reliance of western histories on the battle and of the campaign on French sources , has been noted by later historians . 
 The views of historians of the outcome of the battle changed with the passage of time and the changing political situations surrounding them . Kutuzov proclaimed a victory both to the army and to Emperor Alexander . While many a general throughout history claimed victory out of defeat ( Ramses II of Egypt did so ) and in this case , Kutuzov was the one man to whom the entire Russian Army could give its allegiance , but it was an army that , despite the huge losses , considered itself undefeated . Announcing a defeat would have removed Kutuzov from his command , and further damaged an army that had endured much and still stood proud . While Alexander was not deceived by the announcement , it gave him the justification needed to allow Kutuzov to march his army off to rebuild the Russian forces and later complete the near utter destruction of the French army . As such , what was said by Kutuzov and those supporting his views was allowed to pass into the histories of the time unchecked . 
 Histories during the Soviet era raised the battle to a mythic contest with serious political overtones and had Kutuzov as the master tactician on the battlefield , directing every move with the precision of a ballet master directing his troupe . Kutuzov 's abilities on the battlefield were , in the eyes of his contemporaries and fellow Russian generals , far more complex and often described in less than flattering terms . Noted author and historian David G. Chandler writing in 1966 , echoes the Soviet era Russian histories in more than a few ways , asserting that General Kutuzov remained in control of the battle throughout , ordered counter @-@ moves to Napoleon 's tactics personally rather than Bagration and Barclay doing so and put aside personal differences to overcome the dispositional mistakes of the Russian army . Nor is the tent scene played out ; instead Kutuzov remains with the army . Chandler also has the Russian army in much better shape moving to secondary prepared positions and seriously considering attacking the next day . Later historians <unk> and <unk> have Kutuzov leaving most of the battle to Bagration and Barclay de Tolly , leaving early in the afternoon and relaying orders from his camp 30 minutes from the front . His dispositions for the battle are described as a clear mistake leaving the right far too strong and the left much too weak . Only the fact that Bagration and Barclay were to cooperate fully saved the Russian army and did much to mitigate the bad positioning . Nothing would be more damning than 300 artillery pieces standing silent on the Russian right . 
 = = Casualties = = 
 The casualties of the battle were staggering : according to French General Staff Inspector P. <unk> , the Grande Armée lost approximately 28 @,@ 000 soldiers : 6 @,@ 562 ( including 269 officers ) were reported as dead , 21 @,@ 450 as wounded . But according to French historian Aristid <unk> , at least 460 French officers ( known by name ) were killed in battle . In total , the Grande Armée lost 1 @,@ 928 officers dead and wounded , including 49 generals . The list of slain included French Generals of Division Auguste @-@ Jean @-@ Gabriel de Caulaincourt , Louis @-@ Pierre Montbrun , Jean Victor Tharreau and Generals of Brigade Claude Antoine Compère , François Auguste Damas , Léonard Jean Aubry Huard de Saint @-@ Aubin , Jean Pierre <unk> , Charles Stanislas Marion , Louis Auguste Marchand <unk> , and Jean Louis <unk> . 
 Suffering a wound on the Borodino battlefield was effectively a death sentence , as French forces did not possess enough food for the healthy , much less the sick ; consequently , equal numbers of wounded soldiers starved to death , died of their injuries , or perished through neglect . The casualties were for a single day of battle , while the Russian figures are for the 5th and the 7th , combined . Using the same accounting method for both armies brings the actual French Army casualty count to 34 @,@ 000 – 35 @,@ 000 . 
 Some 52 @,@ 000 Russian troops were reported as dead , wounded or missing , including 1 @,@ 000 prisoners ; some 8 @,@ 000 men were separated from their units and returned over the next few days , bringing the total Russian losses to 44 @,@ 000 . Twenty @-@ two Russian generals were killed or wounded , including Prince Bagration , who died of his wounds on September 24 . 
 Historian Gwynne Dyer compared the carnage at Borodino to " a fully @-@ loaded 747 crashing , with no survivors , every 5 minutes for eight hours . " 
 Taken as a one @-@ day battle in the scope of the Napoleonic conflict , this was the bloodiest battle of this series of conflicts with combined casualties between 64 @,@ 000 and 65 @,@ 000 . The next nearest battle would be Waterloo , at about 55 @,@ 000 for the day . 
 In the historiography of this battle , the figures would be deliberately inflated or underplayed by the generals of both sides attempting to lessen the impact the figures would have on public opinion both during aftermath of the battle or , for political reasons , later during the Soviet period . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Although the Battle of Borodino can be seen as a victory for Napoleon , some scholars and contemporaries described Borodino as a Pyrrhic victory . Russian historian Oleg Sokolov agrees that Borodino constituted a Pyrrhic victory for the French , which would ultimately cost Napoleon the war and his crown , although at the time none of this was apparent to either side . Sokolov adds that the decision to not commit the Guard saved the Russians from an Austerlitz @-@ style defeat and quotes Marshal Laurent de Gouvion Saint @-@ Cyr , one of Napoleon 's finest strategists , who analyzed the battle and concluded that an intervention of the Guard would have torn the Russian army to pieces and allowed Napoleon to safely follow his plans to take winter quarters in Moscow and resume his successful campaign in spring or offer the Tsar acceptable peace terms . Digby Smith calls Borodino ' a draw ' but believes that posterity proved Napoleon right in his decision to not commit the Guard so far away from his homeland . According to Christopher Duffy , the battle of Borodino could be seen as a new Battle of Torgau in the 18th century , when both of the sides sustained terrible losses but neither could achieve their tactical goals , and the battle itself did not have a clear result , even though both sides claimed the battle as their own victory . 
 However , in a long term war of attrition , the battle was just one more source of losses to the French when they were losing two men to one . Both the French and the Russians suffered terribly but the Russians had reserve troops , and a clear advantage in the logistics war . The French Army supplies came over a long road lined with hostile forces . According to <unk> , so long as the Russian Army existed the French continued to lose . This victory ultimately cost Napoleon his army , as it allowed the French emperor to believe that the campaign was winnable , exhausting his forces as he went on to Moscow to await a surrender that would never come . Historian <unk> notes that the Borodino victory allowed Napoleon to move on to Moscow , where — even allowing for the arrival of reinforcements — the French Army only possessed a maximum of 95 @,@ 000 men , who would be ill @-@ equipped to win a battle due to a lack of supplies and ammunition . The Grande Armée suffered 66 % of its casualties by the time of the Moscow retreat ; snow , starvation , and typhus ensured that only 23 @,@ 000 men crossed the Russian border alive . Furthermore , while the Russian army suffered heavy casualties in the battle , they had fully recovered by the time of Napoleon 's retreat from Moscow ; they immediately began to interfere with the French withdrawal , costing Napoleon much of his surviving army . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Poet Mikhail Lermontov romanticized the battle in his poem Borodino . The battle was famously described by Count Leo Tolstoy as " a continuous slaughter which could be of no avail either to the French or the Russians " in the culminating books X and XI of his novel War and Peace . A huge panorama representing the battle was painted by Franz <unk> for the centenary of Borodino and installed on the <unk> Hill in Moscow to mark the 150th anniversary of the event . Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky also composed his 1812 Overture to commemorate the battle . 
 In Russia , the Battle of Borodino is reenacted yearly on the first Sunday of September . On the battlefield itself , the Bagration flèches are preserved ; a modest monument has been constructed in honour of the French soldiers who fell in the battle . There are also remnants of trenches from the seven @-@ day battle fought at the same battlefield in 1941 between the Soviet and German forces ( which took fewer human lives than the one of 1812 ) . 
 A commemorative 1 @-@ ruble coin was released in the Soviet Union in 1987 to commemorate the 175th anniversary of the Battle of Borodino , and four million were minted . A minor planet <unk> Borodino , discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1977 was named after the village Borodino . 
 = Thomas Jefferson Hogg = 
 Thomas Jefferson Hogg ( 24 May 1792 – 27 August 1862 ) was a British barrister and writer best known for his friendship with the Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley . Hogg was raised in County Durham , but spent most of his life in London . He and Shelley became friends while studying at University College , Oxford , and remained close until Shelley 's death . During their time at Oxford they collaborated on several literary projects , culminating in their joint expulsion following the publication of one controversial treatise . They remained good friends , but their relationship was sometimes strained because of Hogg 's attraction to the women who were romantically involved with Shelley . 
 Hogg became a barrister and met Jane Williams , who had become a close friend of Percy Shelley 's shortly before the poet 's death . Jane became Hogg 's common @-@ law wife and they had two children together . The family settled in London , although Hogg 's legal career meant that he often had to travel away from home . 
 While living in London Hogg made the acquaintance of several well @-@ known writers , and he published literary works of his own . He studied Greek literature for much of his life and published several articles on the subject , including two entries in the Encyclopædia Britannica . Most of the fiction he wrote was poorly reviewed . His best @-@ known literary work was The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley , an unfinished biography of the poet . Although the book was well researched and painted a clear picture of Shelley as a young man , it was criticised for portraying him negatively . 
 Hogg was well connected with Whig politicians . He received an appointment to a government commission on municipal corporations and became a revising barrister . His legal career was moderately successful , but he was often frustrated by his failure to attain his goal of becoming a professor or judge . Nevertheless , he was able to provide for his family thanks to an inheritance and the income from his legal career . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Thomas Jefferson Hogg was the eldest of John and Prudentia ( née Jones ) Hogg 's six children . He was given his paternal grandfather 's first name and his paternal grandmother 's last name . John 's father was the son of a wealthy businessman and Prudentia 's father was a Welsh clergyman . Although John was trained as a barrister , he did not practise law regularly . He instead devoted his time to managing his estate and serving as a justice of the peace . The family lived in a Georgian manor known as Norton House , situated 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) outside Stockton @-@ on @-@ Tees . 
 As a young man , Thomas Jefferson read many books , including Paradise Lost , Tristram Shandy and the Life of Johnson . John taught his son Greek and Latin . Every summer the family rented a house in Seaton Carew , where Thomas Jefferson often hunted , fished and went horse riding . He attended a preparatory school in Ferrybridge for four years before moving to Durham School at the age of 12 , which his father and grandfather had also attended . 
 = = Oxford = = 
 In 1810 Hogg went up to University College , Oxford , his father 's alma mater . There he met and became friends with Percy Bysshe Shelley in October 1810 . Hogg and Shelley often discussed literature and metaphysics , had a shared disdain for religion and Oxford society , and were united in their belief in free love and free thinking . Although Shelley 's father initially feared that his son was being corrupted by Hogg 's ideas , he was reassured when he learned that Hogg was from a respectable family . 
 Hogg and Shelley collaborated on a pamphlet of " mock revolutionary " poetry in late 1810 , Posthumous Fragments of Margaret Nicholson , that they attributed to Nicholson herself . She was a mentally unstable washerwoman who in 1786 had attempted to stab King George III with a dessert knife . They also composed a novel together , Lenora , but could not find a printer who was willing to publish such a subversive work . 
 In early 1811 Shelley and Hogg published The Necessity of Atheism , which outraged the Oxford authorities . Although it was published anonymously , suspicion soon fell on the pair . They refused either to acknowledge or to deny writing the work , and were expelled from Oxford as a result . 
 = = York = = 
 After leaving Oxford , Hogg was sent to York to serve a legal apprenticeship . Timothy Shelley was furious when he learned of the expulsion , but John Hogg was not minded to discipline his son or to forbid him from associating with Percy Shelley . Prudentia Hogg , who was an Evangelical Christian , was shocked when she learned that her son was promoting atheism . She was further angered when she learned that her son had become a vegetarian , a decision that she attributed to Shelley 's corrupting influence . 
 Hogg found employment in a conveyancer 's office in York . Percy Shelley initially planned to visit him , but changed his plans in the spring of 1811 after he fell in love with a young woman named Harriet Westbrook . Shelley had always been opposed to the institution of marriage , but he cared deeply for Harriet and feared she would leave him if they did not marry . Hogg repeatedly made the case to Shelley that marriage was in Harriet 's best interests . Shelley was eventually persuaded and eloped with Harriet to Edinburgh . 
 That autumn Hogg visited the couple in Edinburgh , which he greatly enjoyed . Hogg soon became very attracted to Harriet , and often spent time alone with her whenever Percy asked to write in solitude . Hogg eventually told Harriet of his feelings towards her , but she politely rebuffed him , and began to read novels with moral themes aloud in his presence . 
 After a stay of six weeks , Hogg had to return to the conveyancer 's office in York , and the Shelleys decided to accompany him back to his home in that city . In October 1811 Percy left for London to mediate in a dispute between his father and his uncle . Harriet remained with Hogg , who soon made further unsuccessful romantic advances towards her . Harriet 's mother soon learned that Hogg and her daughter were living together , and sent Harriet 's sister to stay with them . Harriet complained to Percy Shelley on his return about the way Hogg had treated her ; Percy was offended , but nevertheless remained on friendly terms with Hogg . Troubled by the distress felt by his housemates , Percy Shelley suddenly decided to leave York with Harriet and her sister . Hogg subsequently sent him a series of angry letters in which he complained about how he had been treated . In his replies Shelley maintained that he still valued free love , but had left to calm Harriet . Hogg and Shelley subsequently exchanged many emotional letters over the course of the following two months , but then ceased communicating for a year . 
 In 1811 Hogg wrote a picaresque novel , Memoirs of Prince <unk> Haimatoff . He published it anonymously , with the claim that it had been translated from Latin by a man named John Brown at Prince Haimatoff 's request . The book did not sell very well . Later critics have noted a resemblance between Haimatoff and Percy Shelley . Shelley wrote a mostly positive review of the book published in The Critical Review in 1814 , but he did criticise the author for promoting " promiscuous concubinage " , apparently a veiled reference to Hogg 's attempts to seduce Harriet . 
 = = Law studies = = 
 Hogg moved from York to London in the spring of 1812 to study law . He tried to conceal his political views from his classmates and spent long hours studying law and reading Greek literature . In 1813 Hogg reconciled with the Shelleys after they visited him in London . They remained in contact after the couple left on a journey to Wales and Ireland . In April 1814 , Hogg went to Ireland in an attempt to cheer up Percy Shelley , who had complained of poor spirits in a letter . The Shelleys did not receive Hogg 's last letter before he embarked on the journey and had left Dublin before he arrived . Unable to locate them , he returned home . Shelley soon travelled back to London as well . 
 In the summer of 1814 , Hogg first met Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin while visiting William Godwin with Percy Shelley . Soon Hogg heard that Shelley had abandoned Harriet and eloped with Mary to Continental Europe . They returned later that year and Hogg was re @-@ introduced to Mary in November 1814 . Although she was initially cool towards him , Mary soon began to enjoy his frequent visits . Hogg became very attracted to Mary Shelley , and when Percy learned of his feelings towards her he encouraged both of them to have an affair , as an expression of free love . Mary , too , valued free love and was initially open to the idea , until she learned that she was pregnant . 
 The Shelleys moved to Windsor in the summer of 1815 . Hogg visited them there when his workload permitted . They left England for Continental Europe again in May 1816 , and Hogg resumed his visits after their return , but he was no longer as close to them as he had been . This was in part due to his awkwardness with Mary , who was preoccupied with her efforts to finish writing Frankenstein . Percy and Hogg were nonetheless able to convince Mary to attend the opera with them on a few occasions . 
 Percy Shelley soon decided to leave England for Italy in an attempt to improve his health , despite Hogg 's attempts to dissuade him . He often invited Hogg to visit him and Mary , which he never did . 
 John and Prudentia Hogg were glad to hear that the Shelleys had left England , hoping that their son would become more conservative in Percy 's absence . They were disappointed with his continued rejection of their Tory political views , but he did attend church with them during his visits and was no longer a vegetarian . They were also somewhat concerned about Hogg 's association with the radical publisher Leigh Hunt and his circle of friends . Through Hunt , Hogg became acquainted with several members of London 's literary circles , including Thomas Love Peacock , Charles Lamb and Walter Coulson . Hogg also met John Keats , who gave him a copy of his first book of poetry . 
 Hogg was called to the bar at the Michaelmas term in 1817 , and often practised law in Northumberland and Durham . He frequently visited his family , with whom he was then on good terms . His reserved personality proved to be a hindrance to his career , and he remained dependent on financial assistance from his father . He continued studying Greek , and an article that he wrote on Apuleius was published in the third issue of The Liberal in 1822 . A paper that he submitted for the fourth issue was rejected , causing him to resent the editors . 
 = = Jane Williams = = 
 In 1823 Hogg met Jane Williams while they were both visiting Percy Shelley 's friend John Gisborne , husband of Maria Gisborne . Jane and her common @-@ law husband Edward Ellerker Williams had been housemates of Shelley 's shortly before his death . Edward Williams and Shelley died in a boating accident , leaving Jane alone with two young children . Hogg soon became very enamoured with her . They saw each other at the Gisborne household regularly during the autumn and early winter of 1823 . That December he went back to Northern England to see his family . While he was there , he began writing to Jane regularly . The following spring he frequently visited her at her mother 's house , and they often took long walks together . In March she moved out of her mother 's house into a home of her own , allowing Hogg to see her more freely . 
 Jane was still legally married . Therefore , Hogg risked his family 's wrath if he pursued a relationship with her . The couple were initially very discreet , and even denied to close friends that they were romantically involved . The situation was eased by the death of Hogg 's father 's in late 1823 ; the inheritance he received assured his financial security . 
 In 1825 Hogg accompanied his brother John on a tour of Continental Europe . Jane encouraged him to take the trip , believing that it would be a test of his commitment to her . He returned to England in February 1826 . Although Hogg enjoyed the trip , he missed reading Greek literature and English newspapers . Writing the journals that were published in 1827 under the title Two Hundred and Nine Days occupied much of his time during the trip . He frequently attacked the Catholic Church and customs officials in his journals , but he often made positive observations about the lifestyles of many of the ordinary people that he met . Hogg also recounted his visit to the grave of Percy Shelley in Italy . 
 = = Children = = 
 Jane became pregnant in spring 1827 and moved into Hogg 's house . She then became known as Mrs Hogg , and he devoted himself to being a father to her two children . 
 Few people in London other than their close friends knew that the couple were not married . Hogg 's family had heard rumours that he was planning to marry , and had been curious to know whom he had chosen . They were very upset after hearing of his plans for a union with Jane . His mother was unwilling to introduce Jane to their social circles as Mrs Hogg , which ensured that she would never visit them . Hogg did not enter his family 's house in Durham for seven years after he informed them of his relationship with Jane . Word of their union spread throughout Durham , and Hogg stopped practising law there for some time because of the damage to his reputation . Several of their friends were supportive of their union . Mary Shelley particularly approved of their match , despite having earlier been jealous of the time Hogg had spent with Jane . 
 The couple 's first child , Mary Prudentia Hogg , was born in November 1827 . Her parents did their best not to spread the news , because she was born soon after they began cohabiting . Mary Prudentia died in May 1829 . Jane gave birth to their second daughter , Prudentia , in 1836 , and Mary Shelley was selected as her godmother . Hogg 's friendship with Mary Shelley was disrupted several years later , however , when she republished Percy Shelley 's Queen Mab in 1839 . Hogg rebuked her for leaving out its previous dedication to Harriet Shelley , and they did not communicate with each other for several years . 
 = = Legal career and scholarship = = 
 Hogg continued studying Greek literature and was able to publish some of his opinions about the Greeks in the radical Westminster Review . He used the opportunity to criticise the treatment of the Greeks in the Tory publication Quarterly Review . This article caused some controversy among Hogg 's conservative legal colleagues . 
 Because the advancement of his legal career had been hindered by his marriage to Jane , Hogg hoped to receive a legal appointment from a politically connected acquaintance . This was not an immediate option because the Whig party was in opposition , but in the summer of 1827 Henry Brougham promised Hogg a future position as a professor of civil law at the newly created University College London . Hogg embarked on a course of study in preparation , but the professorship was not established owing to a lack of funds . This setback upset Hogg greatly , and he became very bitter about it . A lecture that he had intended to give at his inauguration was published in 1831 . 
 Hogg had also hoped that his friend Thomas Love Peacock , who worked for the East India Company , would recommend him for a position there . To Hogg 's dismay Peacock would not help him , although several years later Peacock did help Hogg 's stepson gain employment with the company . 
 Hogg published Shelley at Oxford , an account of his memories of Shelley in The New Monthly Magazine in 1833 . The article was heavily edited after its submission , which irritated him greatly . The editing was effective however , and many reviewers were very impressed by the finished product . He also contributed articles to the Edinburgh Review . One notable article was a review of the first volume of Barthold Georg Niebuhr 's <unk> Geschichte . The editor of the Edinburgh Review , <unk> Napier , chose another writer to review the second volume , which infuriated Hogg . 
 Henry Brougham became Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom after a Whig election victory . In 1833 he appointed Hogg to a lucrative position on the royal commission to examine the municipal corporations . Hogg became a fierce critic of the Municipal Corporations Act ; he preferred a more deliberate and less ideological approach than most of his fellow commission members , and was considered by many to be an unusually conservative Whig . His commission work required him to be away from home for an extended period , which proved to be very difficult for Jane . She knew that Hogg was free to abandon her at any time because they were not legally married . After receiving his appointment , Hogg finally visited Norton House after a seven @-@ year absence , but his family had not altered their opinion of his relationship with Jane . 
 After his service on the commission ended , Hogg resumed practising law in Northern England , where his brother John had also recently begun to practice . John soon became offended by his brother , objecting to his attempt to use family connections to advance his career . 
 Hogg gained the position of revising barrister for Northumberland and Berwick in 1838 . This required him to travel to Northern England twice a year . Jane often complained about these trips , but Hogg enjoyed visiting the north . He hoped that his legal service would earn him an appointment as a judge , but he was to be disappointed . 
 In 1841 Hogg wrote Some Recollections of Childhood , a historical novel set in London at the time of the Norman Conquest . He published its chapters in instalments in Edward Bulwer 's Monthly Chronicle . The book was not well received by critics , who complained of its discursive nature and poor character development ; William Makepeace Thackeray published a particularly scathing review . Hogg had gained a reputation as a Greek scholar however , and contributed to the Encyclopædia Britannica ; he was the author of the " Alphabet " and " Antiquities " entries in the seventh edition . 
 = = Family conflicts = = 
 In 1843 Hogg became the target of a blackmail attempt by John Edward Johnson , Jane 's husband . Johnson provided journalist Barnard Gregory with the details of Jane 's marital status . Gregory soon published a report on her in The Satirist , but made a crucial mistake . Gregory claimed that the wife of James Hogg , a Member of Parliament for Beverly , was legally married to another man , prompting James Hogg to initiate a libel suit against Gregory . Johnson quickly disappeared after he learned of the error . Gregory was convicted of libel and served a brief prison sentence . Following his release he prepared a correction that he intended for publication , which could have threatened Hogg 's legal position . Hogg appealed to Leigh Hunt , who convinced Gregory not to publish . John Edward Johnson died in 1840 , ensuring that Jane would never be blackmailed because of her marital status . Although Hogg and Jane were now free to marry they chose not to , to avoid revealing their situation . 
 Hogg 's mother Prudentia died in 1839 . As a condition of his father 's will , upon the death of his mother , Thomas Jefferson Hogg could purchase his brother 's share of Norton House . He decided not to , because of the potential cost of maintaining the house and the hostility Jane could face there . Instead , he allowed his brother to buy his interest in the house , a decision that led to conflict between the two brothers regarding the price and timing of the sale . They eventually worked out the details , and their relationship became friendlier once the sale was completed . 
 Hogg and his family subsequently lived a mostly quiet and stable life together . At times their finances were strained , although they were able to afford a cook and a maid . Hogg enjoyed spending time with his children and paid particular attention to their education . He taught his daughter Prudentia Greek and Latin , but discouraged her from becoming a Bluestocking . Hogg also tried to convince Jane to study Greek , but was unsuccessful . Henry Cleveland , Jane 's nephew , moved into their household after leaving the military . Hogg then accepted Henry as a member of the family . Gardening had always been a hobby of Hogg 's , and in his later years he often spent time maintaining his gardens with Jane . 
 The family 's domestic peace was shattered when Hogg 's stepdaughter Jane Rosalind became romantically involved with Henry Hunt , the son of Leigh Hunt . Hunt had no clear employment prospects , causing Thomas and Jane to doubt the wisdom of a union . Hogg was very gentle when discussing this with his stepdaughter , hoping to avoid treating her the way that Timothy Shelley had treated Percy Shelley years earlier , but Mary Shelley thought that Hogg took much too passive a stance . Thomas and Jane decided to send Jane Rosalind to France in an unsuccessful attempt to distract her , but she soon returned and married Hunt . 
 = = The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley = = 
 In 1857 Percy Florence Shelley , the poet 's only surviving child , invited Hogg to produce a biography of his father , who had died more than 30 years earlier . The Shelley family provided Hogg with a number of Percy Shelley 's papers for use in his research . 
 The first two volumes of The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley were published in 1858 , but were poorly received by critics . The book was not as well edited as his previous article and many felt that it did not contain the insights about Shelley and his works that Shelley at Oxford did . The reception was not universally negative however , and several of Shelley 's friends enjoyed the book . The Shelley family was very upset at the way Shelley was portrayed ; they demanded the return of Shelley 's papers and obtained an injunction preventing the publication of any further volumes . Hogg had begun writing a third , but it was never completed .

 In later life Hogg suffered from gout , which forced him to curtail many of his activities . He died in his sleep in 1862 at the age of 70 . His brother John wrote a very positive obituary for The Gentleman 's Magazine . 
 Hogg left an estate with a net worth of £ 17 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to about £ 1 @.@ 43 million in 2016 ) , most of which went to his daughter , but Jane was also provided for . His brother was bequeathed his collection of books . His sisters , who were by then fairly wealthy , were left only token amounts . Hogg was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery , where Jane was buried beside him 22 years later . 
 = Stacy Warner = 
 Stacy Warner is a fictional recurring character portrayed by Sela Ward on the Fox Broadcasting Company 's medical drama House . She was in a relationship with Dr. Gregory House ( Hugh Laurie ) , when a clotted aneurysm in his right thigh led to an infarction during a game of golf , causing his quadriceps muscle to become necrotic . Regarding House 's treatment , Stacy acted against House 's wishes when he was put into a chemically induced coma . She authorized a safer surgical middle @-@ ground procedure by removing just the dead muscle , leaving House with a lesser , but serious , level of pain for the rest of his life . House could not forgive her and they broke up . The two meet again , five years later , at the end of season one ; Stacy wants House to treat her husband , Mark . House correctly diagnoses Mark with acute intermittent porphyria , and so he has to remain at the hospital for close monitoring . Stacy becomes the hospital 's lawyer , and she and House grow closer together . When she is ultimately willing to leave Mark for him , House tells her to go back to Mark , which devastates her and causes her and Mark to leave the city . 
 When the writers of the show wrote " Three Stories " , the first episode in which Stacy appeared , the first name they came up with to play the character was Sela Ward . Although Ward was not initially interested in portraying Stacy , she changed her mind after watching tapes of the show . While she was originally hired to appear in only two episodes of the first season , the chemistry between Ward and Laurie was strong enough to have her appear in seven more second season episodes . She also appeared in the House finale " Everybody Dies " . Stacy was received mostly positively by critics who considered her arc a " juicy subplot " . 
 = = Arc = = 
 Although not much is revealed about Stacy 's early life , it is said in " Acceptance " that she is a Duke University graduate . Presumably ten years before the events of House , at a " Doctors vs. Lawyers " paintball game , she met Dr. Gregory House ( Hugh Laurie ) with whom she started a romantic relationship . Five years later , during a game of golf , House suffered an infarction in his right leg . He was admitted at the Princeton @-@ Plainsboro Teaching Hospital , but went misdiagnosed for three days due to doctors ' concerns that he was exhibiting drug @-@ seeking behavior ( House eventually diagnosed the infarction himself ) . An aneurysm in his thigh had clotted , leading to an infarction and causing his quadriceps muscle to become necrotic . House had the dead muscle bypassed in order to restore circulation to the remainder of his leg , risking organ failure and cardiac arrest . He was willing to endure excruciating post @-@ operative pain to retain the use of his leg . After he was put into a chemically induced coma to sleep through the worst of the pain , Stacy , his medical proxy at the time , acted against his wishes and authorized a safer surgical middle @-@ ground procedure between amputation and a bypass by removing just the dead muscle . This resulted in the partial loss of use in his leg , and left House with a lesser , but still serious , level of pain for the rest of his life . House could not forgive Stacy for making the decision , which caused their relationship to end . 
 Stacy goes to visit House again in " Three Stories " , five years after their break up . She has married Mark Warner ( Currie Graham ) , a high school guidance counselor . Stacy believes Mark is ill , and wants House to treat him . However , Mark does not believe anything is wrong with him , as well as the members of House 's diagnostic team who can not seem to find any medical problems . After various failed attempts to diagnose Mark , House tests Marks urine for porphobilinogen ; the test turns out positive , and Mark is diagnosed with acute intermittent porphyria ( AIP ) . He is therefore required to have " close monitoring " at the hospital for a while . Stacy makes a deal with Lisa Cuddy ( Lisa Edelstein ) to become the hospital 's lawyer during Mark 's stay at the hospital . During Stacy 's time as the hospital 's lawyer , she and House grow closer together . In " Need to Know " , they end up spending the night together . However , when Stacy prepares to leave Mark for House , House rejects her , stating that he cannot make her happy , because he cannot change . Stacy quits her job and returns to Short Hills , New Jersey , with Mark . She later appears in the series finale , " Everybody Dies " , first as one of House 's hallucinations and then at House 's funeral .

 As House 's creator David Shore says , being the " true love that got away " , Stacy is a " quick " and " witty " character , who is " the one character who is able to spar with House on a level playing field . " <unk> Sela Ward has described her character as a window into House 's vulnerability and his heart . House simply describes Stacy as " very convincing " , as Mark thinks there is nothing wrong with him , but House says that if Stacy says that Mark is ill , he is ill . Many critics noted that Stacy 's presence affected House 's behaviour , Diane Kristine of Blog Critics stated that , with Stacy , House was " almost nice " . While Stacy has told House on several occasions that she loves Mark , she is still very much in love with House and was willing to have an affair with him ; however , she admits that she finds House selfish and that " with Mark , there 's room for [ her ] " . 
 = = Development = = 
 According to the producers of House , Stacy was brought into the show to give viewers some insight into House . The writers chose to start off Stacy 's story arc " very subtly " , but to end it with a " big blowout " . Shore explained that he wanted Ward for the part because it was the first person the writing staff of House came up with , adding that she acts in a " simple " and " convincing way " . Initially , Ward was not interested in portraying the character , because , after the cancellation of Once and Again , she wanted to spend more time with her kids , which is why she had also turned down earlier roles on CSI : Miami and Desperate Housewives . However , she changed her mind when she saw tapes of the show , because as she watched she realized that House " would be fun to be a part of " . 
 In a 2005 Entertainment Weekly interview , Ward , who had never appeared in a medical show before , stated that when she was young , her mother was sick for over nine years and she spent a lot of time in hospitals . This being the reason that , on the set of House , she felt " at home , in a strange way " . While she was initially hired to appear only in " Three Stories " and " Honeymoon " , the chemistry between Ward and House lead actor Hugh Laurie was strong enough for Ward to return for a multiple @-@ episode story arc in the second season of the show . On working with Ward , Laurie commented " We 're professionals who were lucky enough to be extremely well @-@ equipped with a very sound , true script , the fact that Sela is immensely attractive and we got on well certainly is not an impediment . " Though Ward has expressed that she would like to return to the show , Shore told USA Today in 2006 that , although he was eager to write her back in , there were " no specific plans " to have the character return . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Initial responses to Stacy were mostly positive . TV Guide 's Matt Roush stated that he was pleased with the character showing of House 's soft side , calling the character 's story arc a " juicy subplot " . David Bianculli of The New York Daily News stated that with the addition of Stacy , House shifted " to the top echelon of today 's TV dramas " . Critics of USA Today stated Ward " brought a sense of joy , if fleeting , to the show " . In an article about who annoyed House the most , Entertainment Weekly 's Alynda Wheat stated that Stacy annoyed House third most , ranking behind Amber Volakis ( Anne Dudek ) and Michael Tritter ( David Morse ) . However , Alan Sepinwall , of the Star @-@ Ledger , commented that although he finds Ward a " talented " actress , her character , along with prior , and later , recurring characters , was " humorless " and " determined to ruin the audience 's fun right along with House 's " . 
 = Calgary Flames = 
 The Calgary Flames are a professional ice hockey team based in Calgary , Alberta , Canada . The Flames are members of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . The club is the third major @-@ professional ice hockey team to represent the city of Calgary , following the Calgary Tigers ( 1921 – 27 ) and Calgary Cowboys ( 1975 – 77 ) . The Flames are one of two NHL franchises in Alberta ; the other is the Edmonton Oilers . The cities ' proximity has led to a rivalry known as the Battle of Alberta . 
 The team was founded in 1972 in Atlanta , Georgia as the Atlanta Flames until relocating to Calgary in 1980 . The Flames played their first three seasons in Calgary at the Stampede Corral before moving into their current home arena , the Scotiabank Saddledome ( originally known as the Olympic Saddledome ) , in 1983 . In 1985 – 86 , the Flames became the first Calgary team since the 1923 – 24 Tigers to compete for the Stanley Cup . In 1988 – 89 , the Flames won their first and only championship . The Flames ' unexpected run to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals gave rise to the Red Mile , and in 2011 the team hosted and won the second Heritage Classic outdoor game . 
 The Flames have won two Presidents ' Trophies as the league 's top regular season team , and have claimed five division championships . Individually , Jarome Iginla is the franchise leader in games played , goals , and points , and is a two @-@ time winner of the Maurice Richard Trophy as the league 's leading goal scorer . Miikka Kiprusoff has the most wins by a goaltender in a Calgary Flames uniform . Nine people associated with the Flames have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame . 
 Off the ice , the Flames own a Western Hockey League franchise ( the Calgary Hitmen ) , a National Lacrosse League franchise ( the Calgary Roughnecks ) and a CFL franchise ( the Calgary Stampeders ) . They also lend their name to a bar and entertainment centre called Flames Central on Stephen Avenue in Downtown Calgary . Through the Flames Foundation , the team has donated more than $ 32 million to charity throughout southern Alberta since the franchise arrived .

 = = = Atlanta Flames = = = 
 The Flames were the result of the NHL 's first pre @-@ emptive strike against the upstart World Hockey Association ( WHA ) . In December 1971 , the NHL hastily granted a team to Long Island — the New York Islanders — to keep the WHA 's New York Raiders out of the brand new Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum . Needing another team to balance the schedule , the NHL awarded a team to an Atlanta @-@ based group that owned the National Basketball Association 's Atlanta Hawks , headed by prominent local real estate developer Tom Cousins . Cousins named the team the " Flames " after the fire resulting from the March to the Sea in the American Civil War by General William Tecumseh Sherman , in which Atlanta was nearly destroyed . They played home games in the Omni Coliseum in downtown Atlanta . 
 The Flames were relatively successful early on . Under head coaches Bernie " Boom Boom " Geoffrion , Fred Creighton and Al MacNeil , the Flames made the playoffs in six of eight seasons in Atlanta . In marked contrast , their expansion cousins , the Islanders , won only 31 games during their first two years in the league combined . This relative success did not carry over to the playoffs , however , as the Flames won only two post @-@ season games during their time in Atlanta . 
 Despite the on @-@ ice success , the Atlanta ownership was never on sound financial footing . Longtime general manager Cliff Fletcher said years later that Cousins ' initial financial projections for an NHL team did not account for the WHA entering the picture . The Flames were also a poor draw , and never signed a major television contract . 
 In 1980 , Cousins was in considerable financial difficulty and was forced to sell the Flames to stave off bankruptcy . With few serious offers from local groups , he was very receptive to an offer from Canadian entrepreneur ( and former Oilers owner ) Nelson Skalbania . He was fronting a group of Calgary businessmen that included oil magnates Harley Hotchkiss , Ralph T. Scurfield , Norman Green , Doc and Byron Seaman , and former Calgary Stampeders great Norman Kwong . A last @-@ ditch effort to keep the team in Atlanta fell short , and Cousins sold the team to Skalbania for US $ 16 million , a record sale price for an NHL team at the time . On May 21 , 1980 , Skalbania announced that the team would move to Calgary . He chose to retain the Flames name , feeling it would be a good fit for an oil town like Calgary , while the flaming " A " logo was replaced by a flaming " C " . Skalbania sold his interest in 1981 , and the Flames have been locally owned since .

 Unlike the WHA 's Calgary Cowboys , who folded three years earlier , the Flames were immediately embraced by the city of Calgary . While the Cowboys could manage to sell only 2 @,@ 000 season tickets in their final campaign of 1976 – 77 , the Flames sold 10 @,@ 000 full- and half @-@ season ticket packages in the 7 @,@ 000 seat Stampede Corral . 
 Led by Kent Nilsson 's 49 @-@ goal , 131 @-@ point season , the Flames qualified for the playoffs in their first season in Calgary with a 39 – 27 – 14 record , good for third in the Patrick Division . The team found much greater playoff success in Calgary than it did in Atlanta , winning their first two playoff series over the Chicago Black Hawks and Philadelphia Flyers before bowing out to the Minnesota North Stars in the semi @-@ finals . This early success was not soon repeated . After a losing record in 1981 – 82 , Fletcher jettisoned several holdovers from the Atlanta days who could not adjust to the higher @-@ pressure hockey environment and rebuilt the roster . Over the next three seasons , he put together a core of players that would remain together through the early 1990s . 
 Fletcher 's efforts to match the Oilers led him to draw talent from areas previously neglected by the NHL . The Flames were among the earliest teams to sign large numbers of U.S. college players , including Joel Otto , Gary Suter , and Colin Patterson . Fletcher also stepped up the search for European hockey talent , acquiring Hakan Loob and other key players . He was among the first to draft players from the Soviet Union , including HC CSKA Moscow star Sergei Makarov in 1983 , but Soviet players were not released to Western teams until 1989 . Still , the team was sufficiently improved to challenge the Oilers , who required the maximum seven games to defeat the Flames en route to their 1984 Stanley Cup Championship . 
 In 1983 , the Flames moved into their new home , the Olympic Saddledome ( now known as the Scotiabank Saddledome ) . Located on the grounds of the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede , the Saddledome was built as a venue for the 1988 Winter Olympics . In three seasons in the Corral , the Flames lost only 32 home games . The Saddledome hosted the 37th NHL All @-@ Star Game in 1985 , a 6 – 4 victory by the Wales Conference . 
 = = = 1985 – 1990 = = = 
 The players acquired by Fletcher matured into one of the strongest teams in the league during the mid @-@ 1980s and early 1990s . From 1984 – 85 to 1990 – 91 , the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one . However , they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run , largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals , the powerhouse Oilers . Although the Oilers and Flames usually finished at or near the top of the Campbell Conference , the NHL 's playoff structure of the time made it very likely that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round , rather than in Campbell Conference finals . That same structure made it very likely that the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have to get past the Flames or Oilers ( or both ) in order to make it to the conference finals . From 1983 until 1990 , either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals . 
 By 1986 the Flames landed forwards Doug Risebrough , Lanny McDonald , and Dan Quinn , defenceman Al MacInnis , and goaltender Mike Vernon . Finishing second in the Smythe with a 40 – 31 – 9 record ( the only season from 1984 to 1991 in which they did not finish with 90 or more points ) , the Flames swept the Winnipeg Jets in the first round of the playoffs , setting up a showdown with the Oilers . Edmonton finished 30 points ahead of Calgary during the season , and was heavily favoured to win a third Cup in a row . However , the Flames upset the Oilers in seven games — the only time that the Flames defeated the Oilers in a playoff series during the decade . The series @-@ winning goal came when an errant clearing attempt by Steve Smith ricocheted off goaltender Grant Fuhr 's leg and into his own net . The goal remains one of the most legendary blunders in hockey history . 
 From there , the Flames went on to the Campbell Conference Finals , where they defeated the St. Louis Blues in another seven @-@ game series . This time , Calgary had to survive a scare of its own , shaking off the Monday Night Miracle at the St. Louis Arena . Trailing by a score of 5 – 2 with 10 minutes to play in the third period of Game 6 , the Blues mounted a furious comeback to send the contest into overtime , where Doug Wickenheiser scored to force a deciding seventh game . Calgary would win Game 7 at home , 2 – 1 , advancing into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time . The Flames proved to be no match for the Montreal Canadiens , losing the championship series in five games . Montreal rookie goaltender Patrick Roy was nearly unbeatable in the last two games , allowing only four goals en route to winning the Conn Smythe Trophy . 
 The Flames followed up their run to the Finals with their best regular season to that point . Calgary 's 46 – 31 – 3 record in 1986 – 87 was good for third overall in the NHL , behind the Oilers and Philadelphia Flyers . However , the Flames were unable to duplicate their playoff success of a year prior , losing their first round match @-@ up with the Jets in six games . The season was also difficult off the ice , as 1986 first round draft pick George <unk> was killed in a car accident prior to the season 's start . 
 The Flames recorded their first 100 @-@ point season in 1987 – 88 , earning the Presidents ' Trophy for having the league 's best record and ending the Oilers ' six @-@ year reign atop the Smythe Division in the process . Joe Nieuwendyk became the second rookie in league history to score 50 + goals , earning the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year . Looking to bolster the line @-@ up for a playoff run , the Flames dealt young sniper Brett Hull , along with Steve Bozek , to the Blues for Rob Ramage and Rick Wamsley on March 7 , 1988 . Their playoff frustrations continued , however , after defeating the Los Angeles Kings in five games , Calgary was swept out of the playoffs in four straight by the Oilers . 
 In 1988 – 89 , the Flames continued to improve . They captured their second consecutive Presidents ' Trophy with a franchise record 117 points , finishing 26 points better than the second @-@ place Kings in the Smythe Division . Fletcher continued to tinker with the roster , acquiring Doug Gilmour as part of a six player deal at the trade deadline . In the playoffs , the Flames were stretched to seven games in the first round by the Vancouver Canucks . They relied on several saves by goaltender Mike Vernon , including a famous glove save off a Stan Smyl breakaway in overtime . The save remains a defining moment in Flames history . 
 The Flames then made short work of the Kings , defeating them in four straight , before eliminating the Chicago Blackhawks in five games to set up a rematch of the 1986 Stanley Cup Finals against Montreal . This time , the Flames won in six games , the last being a 4 – 2 victory in Montreal on May 25 , 1989 . The clinching win was especially significant in that it marked the only time that an opposing team defeated the Canadiens to win the Stanley Cup on Montreal Forum ice . Al MacInnis captured the Conn Smythe as playoffs ' most valuable player , while long @-@ time captain Lanny McDonald announced his retirement . The 1989 Stanley Cup win gave Flames co @-@ owner Sonia Scurfield ( Ralph 's widow ) the distinction of being the first ( and as of 2013 , only ) Canadian woman to have her name engraved on the Cup . It also made Kwong one of the few to have his name on both the Stanley Cup and the Grey Cup . 
 In 1989 , due in part to Cliff Fletcher 's diplomatic efforts , the Soviets gave permission for a select group of Soviet hockey players to sign with NHL teams . The first of these players was Sergei Pryakhin . Although Pryakhin never became an NHL regular , his arrival blazed a trail for the large number of Russian players who entered the NHL beginning in 1989 – 90 . Sergei Makarov joined the Flames that season and , though already in his thirties , became the fifth Flame to win the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league 's Rookie of the Year . The selection would prove controversial , prompting the league to amend the rules to exclude any player over the age of 26 from future consideration . That season , the team fell two points shy of their third straight Presidents ' Trophy with 99 points . Also that season , they won their third straight Smythe Division title . In the playoffs , they were dethroned in six games by the Los Angeles Kings . They would not win another playoff series until 2004 — one of the longest such droughts in NHL history . 
 = = = 1991 – 2003 = = = 
 In 1991 , Fletcher left the Flames to become the general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs . He had been the team 's general manager since its inception in 1972 . He was succeeded in Calgary by Doug Risebrough , and the two quickly completed a ten player mega @-@ trade that saw disgruntled forward Doug Gilmour dealt to Toronto with four other players for former 50 goal scorer Gary Leeman and four others . The trade transformed both clubs . The formerly inept Leafs turned into a contender almost immediately , while Leeman scored only eleven goals in a Flames uniform . Despite the blossoming of Theoren Fleury into an NHL star , the Flames missed the playoffs entirely in 1992 , only a year after finishing with their third 100 @-@ point season in franchise history . It was the first time the Flames had missed the playoffs since 1975 , when they were still in Atlanta . It was also only the third time out of the playoffs in the franchise 's 20 @-@ year history . 
 Calgary rebounded to make the playoffs for the next four seasons , including two consecutive division titles . However , they were knocked out in the first round of the playoffs each time . The 1994 and 1995 Division titles led to Game 7 overtime home defeats in the opening round to the Canucks and San Jose Sharks respectively . In the 1995 – 96 season , Nieuwendyk was traded to the Dallas Stars in a deal that acquired Jarome Iginla . Iginla would make his Flames debut in the 1996 postseason during which the Flames again lost in the first round , a four @-@ game sweep by the Blackhawks . In 1997 , only two years after winning their second consecutive division title , the Flames missed the playoffs and would not return for seven years . The low point came in the 1997 – 98 season , in which the Flames finished with only 67 points , the second @-@ lowest point total in franchise history ( behind only the 1972 @-@ 73 Atlanta Flames ) . 
 During this time , the Flames found it increasingly difficult to retain their best players as salaries escalated while the Canadian dollar lost value against the American dollar . Calgary has always been one of the smallest markets in the league ( it is currently third @-@ smallest , behind only Edmonton and Winnipeg ) and the NHL 's small @-@ market Canadian teams found it increasingly difficult to compete in the new environment . In 1999 , for example , the Flames traded Fleury to the Colorado Avalanche midway through the season . The trade came shortly after Fleury became the franchise 's all @-@ time leading scorer . Fleury was due to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season , and the Flames did not want to risk losing him without getting anything in return . 
 As the Flames sank in the standings , their attendance also sagged . For most of their first 16 years in Calgary , Flames tickets were among the toughest to get in the NHL . However , by 1999 , attendance had fallen off so severely that the owners issued an ultimatum : buy more season tickets or the team would join its departed counterparts in Winnipeg and Quebec City in leaving for the United States . The fans responded by buying enough season tickets to keep the Flames in Calgary for the 1999 – 2000 season . The Flames issued another appeal for more season tickets in the summer of 2000 . The campaign , aimed at increasing season ticket sales from a franchise low of 8 @,@ 700 to 14 @,@ 000 , proved successful . The increased sales did not halt the Flames ' financial losses , however , as the team estimated it lost $ 14 @.@ 5 million between 2001 and 2003 . 
 One of the few bright spots in this stretch was Iginla , who captured the Rocket Richard and Art Ross Trophies in 2001 – 02 as NHL goal- and point @-@ scoring champion after scoring 52 goals and 96 points . Iginla again won the Rocket Richard Trophy , tied with Rick Nash and Ilya Kovalchuk , with 41 goals in 2003 – 04 . Another bright spot for the team during this time was defenceman Robyn Regehr who became the youngest nominee ever for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy , which recognizes perseverance , sportsmanship and dedication to hockey . Regehr had suffered two broken legs in a car accident the summer of 1999 , but recovered in time to play 57 games at the age of 19 . 
 During the 2002 – 03 season , the Flames hired Darryl Sutter as the team 's head coach , replacing Greg Gilbert , who was fired as the Flames languished in last place in the Western Conference . Sutter also became the team 's general manager following the season , and is credited with revitalizing the franchise . Among Sutter 's first moves was to acquire goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff , whom he had previously coached in San Jose , early in the 2003 @-@ 04 season . Kiprusoff responded by setting a modern NHL record for lowest goals against average at 1 @.@ 69 . 
 = = = 2004 – 2010 = = = 
 After seven consecutive seasons of not making the playoffs , the Flames finally returned to the post @-@ season in 2004 . They became the first team in league history to defeat three division champions en route to becoming the first Canadian team to make it to the Stanley Cup Finals since the Canucks in 1994 . The Flames ' first victim was the Northwest Division champion Vancouver Canucks , whom they defeated in seven games . It was the Flames ' first playoff series win since they won the 1989 final . 
 The Flames then upset the Presidents ' Trophy winning Detroit Red Wings in six games . After eliminating the Pacific Division champion Sharks , also in six games , in the Western Conference Final , the Flames earned a trip to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals to face the Tampa Bay Lightning . Martin Gelinas scored the winning goal in all three series . The Canadian Embassy in Washington DC , flew the Flames flag beside the Maple Leaf , while Prime Minister Paul Martin dubbed the Flames " Canada 's team " . 
 The final series went to seven games , with the Flames suffering a controversial non @-@ goal in game six at home . Replays showed that Martin Gelinas may have scored what would have been the go @-@ ahead goal late in the third period ; however , the referees never signaled a goal , and later replays were ruled inconclusive . The goal would have made Gelinas the only player in NHL history to score the winning goal in every playoff series en route to winning the Stanley Cup . The Lightning would go on to win the game in double overtime , before winning game seven at home to capture the Stanley Cup . Despite the loss , 30 @,@ 000 fans packed into Olympic Plaza to celebrate the Flames run . 
 The Flames would not raise their Western Conference championship banner for nearly 15 months , as the 2004 – 05 season was wiped out by a labour dispute . During the lockout , team owner and Chairman of the Board , Harley Hotchkiss , attempted to save the season by engaging in discussions with National Hockey League Players Association president Trevor Linden . While their discussions failed to save the season , Hotchkiss was credited with easing tensions that allowed for a successful negotiation of a new collective bargaining agreement . 
 The Flames played their 25th season in Calgary in 2005 – 06 , finishing with 103 points . It was their best total since the 1989 Cup winning season , and good enough to capture their first division title in 12 years . However , the Flames lost to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in seven games during the first round of the playoffs . Miikka Kiprusoff captured both the William M. Jennings and Vezina Trophies as the NHL 's top goaltender , while Dion Phaneuf 's 20 goals was the third highest total for a rookie defenceman in league history . 
 The 2006 off @-@ season began with a trade for Alex Tanguay , formerly of the Colorado Avalanche , and with Sutter relinquishing his head coaching position to assistant Jim Playfair so he could focus on his duties as general manager . Despite a marked improvement in team offence and a solid 96 @-@ point season , it was only good enough for eighth place in a Western Conference where seven teams cracked the 100 @-@ point barrier . In the playoffs , Calgary fell in six games to the top seeded Red Wings in the first round . During the series , the Flames were fined by the NHL for several stick @-@ related penalties in the fifth game . Notably , backup goaltender Jamie McLennan was suspended five games for slashing Red Wings forward Johan Franzen . Franzen would score the series clinching goal in the Game 6 defeat in Double Overtime . 
 Prior to the start of the 2007 – 08 season , the Flames demoted Playfair to associate coach , bringing in Mike Keenan as the team 's third head coach in three years . During the season , Jarome Iginla became the Flames ' all @-@ time leader in games played , passing Al MacInnis ' mark of 803 . Iginla also passed Theoren Fleury 's mark of 364 goals to become the Flames all @-@ time goal scoring leader on March 10 , 2008 . Despite another solid season , with 94 points , they only garnered the seventh seed in the Western Conference . They fell in the Western Conference quarterfinals to the Pacific Division champion Sharks in seven games . Iginla continued to set franchise records in 2008 – 09 , surpassing Fleury 's franchise mark of 830 points , and scoring his 400th goal on the same night against the Lightning . The team failed to advance past the first round of the playoffs , being knocked out by the Chicago Blackhawks in 6 games , resulting in the dismissal of head coach Mike Keenan after two seasons . Brent Sutter was named his successor on June 23 , 2009 , but the Flames failed to qualify for the playoffs in the 2009 – 10 season .

 The Flames struggled to begin the 2010 – 11 NHL season , falling to 14th place in the conference at the Christmas break . Consequently , the organization asked Darryl Sutter to step aside as general manager . The team named assistant Jay Feaster the interim general manager in his place , making it permanent following the season . The team pulled itself back into playoff contention following the change but once again failed to qualify for the post @-@ season . 
 Calgary hosted the 2011 Heritage Classic , the NHL 's second outdoor game of the year , at McMahon Stadium on February 22 , 2011 . The Flames defeated the Canadiens 4 – 0 before 41 @,@ 022 spectators . Miikka Kiprusoff became the first goaltender to record a shutout in an NHL outdoor game . Jarome Iginla reached two major milestones late in the season . He became the 10th player in NHL history to score at least 30 goals in ten consecutive seasons , and scored his 1,000th career point , all with the Flames , with a goal against the St. Louis Blues on April 1 . Iginla also scored his 500th career goal on January 7 , 2012 , against the Minnesota Wild . He scored the goal against goaltender Niklas Backstrom en route to a 3 @-@ 1 Flames victory . On March 27 , 2013 , longtime captain and player Jarome Iginla was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for prospects Kenny Agostino and Ben <unk> and a first @-@ round pick in 2013 ( Morgan <unk> ) , leaving the team without a captain for the first time since the end of the 2002 – 2003 season . Prior to the beginning of the 2013 – 14 NHL season , Mark Giordano was named as the new captain of the Calgary Flames .

 The Flames used their low finishes in the 2012 @-@ 13 and 2013 @-@ 14 seasons to draft prospects such as Sean Monahan , Emile Poirier , Morgan <unk> , and Sam Bennett - prospects who are expected to greatly assist the Flames towards victory in future seasons . 
 In the 2014 – 15 season , the Flames , assisted by 2013 draft pick Monahan and other highly touted prospect Johnny <unk> , won one of their final home games against the Los Angeles Kings to clinch their first playoff spot since 2009 , which eliminated the Kings from the playoffs . They eliminated the Vancouver Canucks in six games in the first round of the playoffs ( which was their first playoff series win since 2004 ) but would be eliminated by the Anaheim Ducks in five games in the second round . 
 In the 2015 – 16 season , the Flames , along with other six Canadian teams , failed to qualify for the playoffs . As a result , in May 2016 , head coach Bob Hartley was relieved of his duties .

 In 1994 , the Flames approached the Saddledome Foundation with a proposal to renovate the Olympic Saddledome , rename it the Canadian Airlines Saddledome and take over management of the facility . The board agreed to this proposal , and was bought out by the Flames for $ 20 million as the team signed a 20 @-@ year agreement to manage the building . 
 Looking to fill extra dates in the Saddledome , the Flames agreed to a lease deal with the expansion Calgary Hitmen of the junior Western Hockey League who began play in 1995 and were partly owned by Theoren Fleury . Two years later , in 1997 , the Flames bought the team for $ 1 @.@ 5 million . During the 2004 – 05 NHL lockout , the Flames heavily marketed the Hitmen , and as a result , the team led all professional or junior hockey teams in North America in attendance , averaging over 10 @,@ 000 fans per game . 
 In April 2006 , the Flames announced that they would be opening a hybrid restaurant , bar and entertainment facility in downtown Calgary on Stephen Avenue . In announcing the venture , Flames ' President and CEO Ken King stated : " While hockey remains our core competency , we are constantly seeking new opportunities in which to grow the Flames brand and allow our fans greater opportunities to enjoy hockey . We believe establishing a location outside of the Pengrowth Saddledome to share food , fun and hockey will bring our fans even closer to the team . " One year later , in April 2007 , Flames Central opened to the public . 
 = = = Flames Foundation = = = 
 The Flames have maintained an active presence in the community since their arrival in Calgary . Through the team 's non @-@ profit charity , the Flames Foundation , the team has donated over $ 32 million to causes throughout southern Alberta . Along with the Rotary Club , the Flames are helping to fund the first children 's hospice in Alberta , and one of only six in North America . 
 The Flames are also close partners with the Alberta Children 's Hospital and the Gordon Townsend School housed within . Among the many activities the Flames participate in , the Wheelchair Hockey Challenge with the Townsend Tigers has remained a highly popular tradition for both the players and the children involved . In 2010 , the Tigers defeated the Flames to move to a perfect 27 – 0 record since the challenge was first instituted in 1981 . 
 = = = Red Mile = = = 
 During the Flames ' run to the Stanley Cup Finals of 2004 , the city of Calgary essentially became the host of a " non @-@ stop party " . The 17th Avenue SW entertainment district , which runs west from the <unk> Saddledome , saw as many as 35 @,@ 000 fans pack the streets during the first three rounds of the playoffs , and over 60 @,@ 000 in the finals . The Red Mile party received coverage in many newspapers across North America , as the parties remained peaceful and incidents were minimal despite the large number of people in a small area . 
 In April 2006 , the Calgary Police Service announced that Red Mile gatherings would not be encouraged , and that measures would be taken to discourage them , including traffic diversions , a zero @-@ tolerance policy on noise and rowdy behaviour , and the presence of plain @-@ clothed officers among the crowd to ticket offenders . After meeting with the Chief of Police , Mayor Dave Bronconnier convinced the Calgary Police Service to relax their ban on the " Red Mile " and encouraged people to make their way to 17th Ave , however the police retained their zero @-@ tolerance policy on public nudity and drunkenness . 
 = = = " C of Red " = = = 
 During the Flames ' run to the Stanley Cup Finals of 2004 , most of the Flames fans attending the hockey games at the Saddledome wore a red jersey with Calgary 's flaming C on it . Sales of the Flames red home jersey , introduced at the start of the 2003 – 04 campaign , were so strong during the playoffs that manufacturer CCM stopped production on all other team jerseys in order to keep up with demand of Flames uniforms . The team set a league record for sales of a new uniform design . The tradition of the C of Red dates back to the 1986 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Oilers . Oiler fans were donning hats promoting " Hat Trick Fever " in their quest for three straight Stanley Cups . Flames fans countered by wearing red . In the 1987 playoffs against Winnipeg , the Jets responded to the C of Red by encouraging fans to wear white , creating the " Winnipeg Whiteout " . During Flames games when " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " is sung , fans shout the words see and red to signify the " C of Red " theme .

 = = = Logo = = = 
 The Flames primary logo is the " Flaming C " design , introduced when the team came to Calgary in 1980 , and was designed by a Calgarian graphic designer named Patricia <unk> . The design of the logo has remained constant since it was created , though the Flames use a different coloured logo for the home and away jerseys . From 1980 until 2000 , the home logo was red on a white background , while the road logo was white on a red background . In 2003 , the NHL switched to using coloured jerseys for the home team . The home logo became black , with the road logo red on a white background . The original " Flaming A " logo of the Atlanta Flames has been restored for use as a patch denoting the team 's alternate captains . The flaming horse logo was retired in 2007 with the introduction of the new Rbk Edge jerseys . 
 = = = Jerseys = = = 
 The Calgary Flames ' original jerseys retained the basic design the team wore in Atlanta : white jerseys with red shoulders and red and yellow stripes , and solid red jerseys with yellow and white stripes . In 1994 , the Flames modified their jersey design , adding black to the team 's colour scheme . The new striping pattern included a diagonal set of stripes from the base of the jersey on the player 's right side coming up to just below the logo . The contrasting shoulder panels on both jerseys were extended down the sleeves , and contained the striping pattern on the forearms . For the 1996 @-@ 97 season , the Flames reintroduced the Atlanta logo as their alternate captain 's patch , and briefly experimented with using a smaller version of the " flaming C " as a captain 's patch . Although the C was soon reverted to match the jersey 's nameplate , the A logo patch remains in use to this day . 
 In 1998 , to celebrate the " Year of the Cowboy " , the Flames introduced its inaugural third jersey design , featuring the " flaming horse " logo on a black background . Two years later , the jersey became the Flames ' road jersey , while the home jersey was updated to incorporate the same V @-@ style striping on the arms and waist of the jersey . This jersey was once again relegated to third jersey status in 2003 when the NHL adopted the coloured jerseys for the home team . 
 In 2007 , with the introduction of the Rbk Edge jersey , the Flames updated their look once again , replacing the horizontal striping with vertical striping down the sides . To honour the team 's heritage , the Flames added the flags of Alberta and Canada as shoulder patches . In celebration of their 30th season in Calgary , the Flames wore their original jersey design for five games in 2009 – 10 , each against a Canadian opponent . The 2009 @-@ 10 version of the jersey was produced in the traditional style that preceded the Edge redesign ; for the following season , the throwback design was adapted to the Edge format as the Flames ' new regular third jersey . 
 For the 2011 Heritage Classic , the Flames were matched against the Montreal Canadiens at McMahon Stadium . For this event game , the Flames wore uniforms inspired by the Calgary Tigers , the city 's first professional hockey team from the 1920s , which represented the Western Canada Hockey League in the 1924 Stanley Cup Finals against the Canadiens . The Flames adapted the Tigers ' black @-@ and @-@ gold jerseys to darker shades of their own colours - maroon and burnt yellow , with a yellow stripe across the chest and alternating stripes on the sleeves . The flaming C logo and pants were cream @-@ coloured , adding to the " vintage " look of the uniform . 
 In 2013 , the Flames introduced a new third jersey to replace their throwback uniform . The newest design is Western @-@ inspired , with a script Calgary in black across the front of the jersey , and black shoulders with points on the front mimicking cowboy wear . The throwback uniform is now only worn for one game during the season . 
 = = = Mascot = = = 
 Harvey the Hound is the Flames ' mascot . He was created in 1983 to serve both with the Flames and the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League . Harvey was the first mascot in the NHL . Harvey is famous for an incident in January 2003 where he had his tongue ripped out by Edmonton Oilers head coach Craig MacTavish as he was harassing their bench . The incident made headlines throughout North America and led to much humour , including having many other NHL team mascots arrive at the 2003 All @-@ Star Game with their tongues hanging out .

 The Calgary Flames have retired two numbers , and a third was retired league @-@ wide . The Flames retired # 9 in honour of Lanny McDonald who played right wing for the Flames from 1981 to 1989 , winning the Stanley Cup as the Flames ' co @-@ captain in his final year . Mike Vernon 's # 30 is also retired ; he was a goaltender with the Flames for fourteen years , from 1982 – 94 and 2000 – 02 . Although not officially retired , the Flames have not issued # 14 since Theoren Fleury left the team in 1999 . 
 In 2012 , the Flames organization introduce " Forever A Flame " programme to honour those who played and represented the Calgary Flames without having to retire their numbers . It enables future Flames the opportunity to wear the numbers of some of the Flames all @-@ time greats . On February 27 , 2012 , defenceman Al MacInnis was the first to earn this distinction , with a banner with his picture and the # 2 number raised to the Scotiabank Saddledome rafters . Joe Nieuwendyk followed him on March 7 , 2014 , promoted as " Forever 25 " as both the number on Nieuwendyk 's jersey and the 25th anniversary of the 1989 title .

 Monster Kingdom : Jewel Summoner is a turn @-@ based role @-@ playing video game developed by Gaia and published by Sony Computer Entertainment and Atlus for the PlayStation Portable console . The game was released in February 2006 in Japan and in February 2007 in North America . 
 The game takes place in a world where monsters and human beings once lived in harmony . The monsters were hunted and many of them were eventually imprisoned in devices called " jewels " . Once trapped in a jewel , a monster becomes tame and servile to the owner of the jewel , allowing human warriors , called Jewel Summoners , to use them in combat against other monsters . The story of Jewel Summoner revolves around the quest for vengeance of one such warrior , Vice , whose mother died at the hands of a monster . 
 Jewel Summoner received mixed reviews from the gaming press . Its monster @-@ collection theme and turn @-@ based gameplay was often compared to Nintendo 's Pokémon series . The game 's audio and voice acting were praised , but its story and gameplay were criticized as uninspired and monotonous . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Jewel Summoner takes place in a third @-@ person perspective with a top @-@ down view . The player character 's avatar moves around a static world map and can enter 3D dungeons . Inside dungeons , the player 's movement will activate random battles against wild monsters ; battles are represented in a split @-@ screen format . Dungeons also contain save points that can be used to restore the health of the party . The player can have a party of up to three characters , and each member has a maximum of three monsters that can be summoned from storage receptacles , called jewels , to fight against enemies . Battles are turn @-@ based and each monster has access to several attacks that it can execute each turn . Monsters do not have individual health bars ; their controlling character 's health is used instead . Enemy monsters can be recruited by weakening them in battle and then capturing them within a jewel . 
 There are over 100 different types of monster in the game , and each possesses traits in the forms of " elements " that dictate its strengths and weaknesses . The element system is similar to a game of " rock @-@ paper @-@ scissors " ; for instance , water @-@ elemental monsters have an advantage over fire @-@ based monsters , and fire @-@ based monsters have an advantage over ice @-@ based ones . A monster can only be captured within a jewel that represents the same element . Monsters earn experience in battle and subsequently level up , learn new abilities , and evolve into different creatures . Jewel Summoners can also influence their monsters ' growth by fusing them with specially refined items and pieces of quartz , or by increasing their stats with " Ability Points " earned in battle . 
 In combat , each Jewel Summoner can bring out one monster at a time . Every turn , each monster ( both enemy and ally ) can activate one attack or elemental ability . Each monster initially has four slots available for abilities . Monsters can quickly learn abilities of their own element type , but can also pick up abilities from other elements . A fire dragon , for instance , can learn snow @-@ based attacks . Using an ability requires the expenditure of a monster 's " Jewel Points " , a mana @-@ like energy of which each creature has only a finite amount . When a monster 's Jewel Points are depleted , it becomes inaccessible to the character and another monster must be selected to fight . Monsters can return to battle when their Jewel Points have been restored at a save point . 
 Jewel Summoner has two options for multiplayer , using the PSP 's " ad @-@ hoc " local wireless feature . Players can trade monsters with each other or fight 1 @-@ on @-@ 1 battles . The game also includes a browser mode that players can use to connect to the Internet and download wallpapers and game trailers . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Long before the events of Jewel Summoner , monsters and humans coexisted peacefully in the game 's world . Eventually , a mysterious event called the " Great Disaster " occurred , and many monsters disappeared . Those that didn 't were contained within " jewels " that became a source of energy that humans harnessed to provide power for their civilization , called the " Powered Civilization " . Occasionally , rogue monsters called Abominations would appear and attack humans indiscriminately . The humans responded by developing a skill known as " Jewel Summoning " , which could be used to fight and capture Abominations . Jewel Summoners are generally descended from a clan called the " Enchanters " and receive special training in the use of jewels . Trained Jewel Summoners work for an organization called the Order and collaborate to fight Abominations . 
 Jewel Summoner 's story centers around a young Jewel Summoner named Vice . Vice 's mother died at the hands of an Abomination named <unk> years before , and Vice has been searching for the monster ever since . Before she died , Vice 's mother gave him a jewel containing a monster , Schatten , and he subsequently discovered that he had the ability to summon and control Schatten despite not having been trained at the Jewel Summoner Academy . Vice traveled for some time , hunting and destroying Abominations , before drawing the attention of the Order . He eventually enrolls at the Academy and is joined by several other Summoners . The rest of the game follows Vice 's journey with his Order teammates and his quest for revenge .

 Jewel Summoner was the first game produced by Gaia , a studio formed by Kouji Okada in 2003 after he departed from Atlus . Okada was one of the co @-@ creators of the Shin Megami Tensei role @-@ playing game series , commonly referred to as " MegaTen " in the West . Okada continued the game mechanic of collecting and raising creatures in Jewel Summoner , altered from MegaTen 's concept of " <unk> " : player @-@ controlled , friendly demons . 
 Okada 's goal with Jewel Summoner was to create an original game " that goes back to the basics of gaming " . At the Akihabara Entertainment Festival in 2005 , Okada explained that the Japanese gaming industry was full of game series and he was interested in developing new ideas . Shortly after Gaia was formed , the new studio learned that Sony was interested in finding developers for its upcoming handheld game console , the PlayStation Portable . Gaia developed Jewel Summoner exclusively for the PSP , including visuals tailored to its screen and a creature development system that would utilize the console 's internal clock to continually train monsters , even when the unit was not in use . 
 Jewel Summoner borrowed several aspects from Okada 's previous games , including Megami Tensei 's concept of elements . Despite the similarities , the art style of Jewel Summoner is more in line with traditional RPGs , instead of MegaTen 's darker , more adult theme . An important design component of the game is its " <unk> " ; the monster training system , which is a staple of Okada 's work . The game 's soundtrack was created by Shinji Hosoe , Hitoshi Sakimoto , Yasunori Mitsuda , Yoko Shimomura , Kenji Ito , Masaharu Iwata , Tsukasa Masuko , Yasuyuki Suzuki , Ayako Saso , and Takahiro Ogata . The game is fully voiced with over 5 total hours of dialogue , which took Gaia a week to record . 
 Jewel Summoner was released on February 23 , 2006 in Japan and February 19 , 2007 in North America . Gamasutra reported that at the time of its North American release , it was listed at # 7 on GamerMetrics , an IGN program that monitors fan anticipation of video games by tracking wish list requests , e @-@ mail notifications , and other Internet @-@ based game data . 
 = = = Future = = = 
 Okada has revealed that the game was planned as the first entry in a series of Monster Kingdom games ; its title was even created with this in mind . Gaia created a comprehensive timeline for Jewel Summoner to allow additional games to be developed within the same universe . Folklore is a PlayStation 3 game with similarities to Jewel Summoner ; developed by Game Republic and released by Sony in 2007 . Gaia assisted Game Republic with Folklore 's monster @-@ creation system , and its original title was Monster Kingdom : Unknown Realms . Another Gaia game , Coded Soul , was released in 2008 and also has gameplay elements in common with Jewel Summoner . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Jewel Summoner received mixed reviews . Its gameplay format , especially the premise of monster collecting , elicited frequent comparisons to Pokémon , a long @-@ running Nintendo series of games . The gameplay itself was considered generic and unoriginal . IGN stated " All too often the same battles happen again and again " , and Game Informer 's reviewer said the battle system " is as boring a turn @-@ based snoozefest as I ’ ve seen in years " . GameZone called Jewel Summoner " prototypical " and said the game " does not stray too far from the formula . You fight , you level , you unlock new skills . " The process of improving monsters was described by GameSpot as too long and needlessly complicated , and IGN declared " for the most part it 's not even worth it . " 
 Reception of the game 's audio was generally positive , with IGN referring to the music as " top @-@ notch " and GamesRadar commenting " The tunes are varied , catchy , match the settings , and show off the PSP 's sound system . " Comments about the voice acting were lukewarm , however , especially regarding the amount of dialogue in the game . GameSpot referred to the dialogue as " dull " and IGN said " the script itself is a mess . " The game 's beginning was described as especially slow . 
 " ... there were times where I just wanted to zip around and gather monsters , but I had to put up with everyone <unk> at each other for over 20 minutes . It wouldn 't be so annoying if this was on a home console , but on the bus to work , there should be less reading and more monster bashing . " 
 The game 's art style and visuals were praised . X @-@ Play said " The monsters [ sic ] designs here are creative , detailed takes on all kinds of different well @-@ known fantasy archetypes . " GameZone 's reviewer said " The monster details are very good , as is the majority of the artwork " , and IGN noted that " Each of the characters also gets nice , crisp art for the conversational scenes . " Game Informer , however , mocked the character design , stating " ... each of the major heroes has some kind of glaring aesthetic blunder to make fun of . From the biggest faux @-@ hawk in history to tan lines that Itagaki would be ashamed to put on one of his characters , there ’ s at least some shallow amusement to be had by mocking these hapless digital rejects .

 = = Plot = = 
 In Broken Bow , Oklahoma , Matthew Prine ( Christian Hoff ) intently watches several televisions simultaneously , scrawling his reactions across every inch of his floor . As he finishes writing , he experiences a vision of the future — nuclear war and its barren aftermath . 
 Later , Millennium Group offender profilers Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) and Peter Watts ( Terry O 'Quinn ) investigate the disappearance of a bus full of schoolchildren . They believe the driver was also a victim , and not responsible ; they meet with the local sheriff , John Cayce ( Steven Rankin ) , who has dredged the bus from a lake . It is empty , but inside , Black experiences the same vision as Prine . He also finds paint transfer on the exterior , indicating the perpetrator was driving a white van . A false positive results as police apprehend storm chasers in a different van , who warn that a violent tornado is approaching . 
 Prine is behind the kidnapping , and forces the children and driver into an underground bunker . He and his accomplice count the hostages , realizing that there is one less child than they had anticipated . Black and Cayce realize this too , and race to the home of the child who had not taken the bus that morning . They arrive in time to apprehend Prine as he attempted to snatch the child , and take him into custody . 
 Black believes Prine is not driven by malice ; he and Watts use the resources of the Millennium Group to find his home , discovering the dense writings across his floors . They learn that Prine believes a third world war is imminent , and took the children as he believes one of them is destined to bring peace during this time , wishing to protect this child when he learns which one it is destined to be . Black seeks aid from another Group member , Lara Means ( Kristen Cloke ) , who is able to observe Prine 's behavioural tells for clues when interviewing him . This , coupled with analysis of soil from his clothing , points to the children being held in an aluminium quarry . The investigators rush to the quarry , where Prine 's accomplice engages them in a firefight . However , the advancing tornado forces them to take cover ; it kills Prine and lifts the roof from the entombing bunker . It subsides as quickly as it arrived , and the children emerge safely from the wreckage ; Black senses that Cayce 's daughter may be the prophesied peacemaker .

 The episode features the second appearance of Kristen Cloke as Millennium Group member Lara Means . Cloke had first portrayed the character in " Monster " , and would last appear in the second season finale " The Time Is Now " . Several of the episode 's minor guest stars would appear again later in the series .

 " 19 : 19 " was first broadcast on the Fox network on November 7 , 1997 . The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 6 @.@ 1 during its original broadcast , meaning that 6 @.@ 1 percent of households in the United States viewed the episode . This represented approximately 5 @.@ 98 million households , and left the episode the eighty @-@ fourth most @-@ viewed broadcast that week . 
 The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a " B " , finding its final act to be powerful and entertaining . However , he believed that the episode suffered from a poor opening act , and was critical of what he saw as a poor performance by guest star Steven Rankin . Bill Gibron , writing for DVD Talk , rated the episode 3 out of 5 , feeling that the episode 's police procedural elements did not mesh well with its theological themes . Gibron felt that the plot 's resolution was overly contrived , but praised the chemistry between the lead actors , highlighting Henriksen and Cloke in particular . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated " 19 : 19 " three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five . Shearman felt the episode was a successful blend of the investigative plot structure used in the first season with the themes of religious eschatology introduced in the second season ; however , he believed that the plot " ran out of steam " by the final act , sacrificing engaging drama for accurate but dry psychology .

 Wensloff began his professional career in the Arizona – Texas League , pitching for the Class @-@ D , El Paso Texans , a team not affiliated with any major league squad , in 1937 . The team included future Major League players Bill <unk> and Milo <unk> , and one former Major League player , Jimmy Zinn . Wensloff pitched 34 games that season , going 17 – 10 with a 4 @.@ 67 ERA in 233 innings pitched .

 In 1938 , Wensloff spent his first season in the New York Yankees minor league system , playing for the Class @-@ C Joplin Miners of the Western Association . In an exhibition game with the Miners against the St. Louis Browns , Wensloff allowed eight runs and failed to pitch for a full inning as the Miners lost , 12 – 5 . In 28 games for the Miners in 1938 , he won and lost 13 games each and finished the season with a 3 @.@ 48 ERA . Wensloff continued his tenure with the Miners during the 1939 season . By the end of July , he had a win @-@ loss record of 17 – 2 . In his final season at the Class @-@ C level , Wensloff compiled a 26 – 4 record in 31 games , pitching 249 innings . At the end of the season , Wensloff had the most wins in the league along with Maury Newlin of the Topeka Owls , and was also third in the league in innings pitched . 
 In 1940 , Wensloff was promoted to the Kansas City Blues of the American Association , a higher level of the Yankees ' farm system , where he played alongside Hall of Famer Phil Rizzuto , among others who later played in the majors . In his first game at the Double @-@ A level , Wensloff allowed only two hits in a game against the Columbus Red Birds . Wensloff pitched in 35 games , 27 starts , going 13 – 8 with a 3 @.@ 19 ERA in 178 innings pitched . The Blues went on to play in the American Association playoffs that season .

Wensloff won his 19th game of the season on August 24 , 1942 , pitching the shortest game of the season , which only lasted one hour and 20 minutes . Wensloff had a 21 – 10 record with a 2 @.@ 47 ERA in 33 games , had the most wins in the league , and was sixth in ERA during that season . On September 27 , 1942 , the New York Yankees purchased nine contracts from their minor league teams , including Herb <unk> and Wensloff 's contracts from Kansas City , which placed them on the major league roster .

 Upon signing a contract with the Yankees , Wensloff spent the 1943 season on the Yankees ' major league roster . During spring training , Yankees manager Joe McCarthy had heard impressive things about Wensloff , though he had not seen him pitch often . Wensloff made his major league debut for the Yankees on May 2 , 1943 against the Washington Senators . In his debut , the second game of a doubleheader , he allowed four earned runs and seven hits in eight innings as the Yankees lost , 4 – 1 . He won his first game in his next pitching appearance on May 7 , 1943 against the Philadelphia Athletics , allowing no walks and six hits in a 6 – 2 victory . By the end of June , he had six complete games in his first six starts . However , he was not receiving the publicity other rookies were , such as pitcher Jesse Flores , and had four wins and four losses despite how well he had been pitching . 
 During the second half of the season , Wensloff remained a major part of the starting rotation . His losses included a 1 – 0 defeat in which he only allowed one unearned run on a wild throw against the St. Louis Browns . During the season , Wensloff added a knuckleball to his selection of pitches , which he threw regularly during the season . As the end of the season approached , Wensloff was being promoted as a rookie of the year candidate , due to being second on the team in strikeouts , as well as his 13 wins . Wensloff finished the season with a 13 – 11 record and a 2 @.@ 54 ERA in 29 games , 27 of them starts . He did not pitch in the 1943 World Series , though he was on the roster .

 At the conclusion of the 1943 season , Wensloff enlisted in the United States Army and served in World War II . When the Yankees were preparing for the start of the 1944 season , the team originally had no idea where Wensloff was , as they had not heard from him . He was inactive for the 1944 season . In 1945 , Wensloff was traded from the Yankees to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League for Johnny <unk> , allowing him to simultaneously pitch professionally and continue serving in the war . In 10 games for the Padres , he won three and lost four with a 3 @.@ 82 ERA . After the 1945 season and the war ended , Wensloff remained in military service , and as a result did not play in 1946 .

 After his service , Wensloff returned to the New York Yankees for the 1947 season . He made his first appearance at the start of June and pitched despite having a sore arm throughout the season , pitching infrequently . In 11 games with the Yankees , Wensloff compiled a record of 3 – 1 with a 2 @.@ 61 ERA and 18 strikeouts in 51 ⅔ innings pitched , and pitched two innings of one game in the 1947 World Series . 
 As the 1948 season began , Wensloff did not report to spring training , and was holding out for a new contract ; the only time he communicated with the club was to inquire about his World Series ring . At the end of March , he was sold by the Yankees to the Philadelphia Phillies for a reported $ 30 @,@ 000 . Wensloff refused to join the Phillies because he did not want to play in the National League , and as a result he was sent back to the Yankees . The Yankees were also in trade talks with the New York Giants , but Wensloff refused to play for them for the same reason . The Yankees continued to look for a trading partner , and eventually traded him to the Cleveland Indians for an undisclosed amount . With the Indians , Wensloff pitched only one game , giving up two earned runs in 1 ⅔ innings pitched on May 4 . He was placed on the disabled list on May 20 , 1948 with continued arm soreness . This later proved to be a career @-@ ending injury for Wensloff , as he retired at the end of the 1948 season . Upon ending his career , <unk> retired to San Rafael , California , and died on February 18 , 2001 . 
 = Church of Scientology editing on Wikipedia = 
 A series of incidents in 2009 led to Church of Scientology @-@ owned networks being banned from making edits to Wikipedia articles relating to Scientology . The Church of Scientology has long had a controversial history on the Internet , and has initiated campaigns to manipulate material and remove information critical of itself from the web . From early in Wikipedia 's history , conflict arose within the topic of Scientology on the website . Disputes began in earnest in 2005 , with users disagreeing about whether or not to describe Scientology as an abusive cult or religion . By 2006 , disagreements concerning the topic of Scientology on Wikipedia had grown more specific . Wikipedia user and Scientology critic David Gerard commented to The Daily Telegraph in 2006 that some articles were neutral due to a requirement to reference stated facts . 
 Revelations from software produced by Virgil Griffith in 2007 called WikiScanner made public the nature of edits on Wikipedia which were able to be traced directly back to Church of Scientology @-@ controlled computers . CBS News and The Independent reported that edits by the Church of Scientology were made in attempts to remove criticism from the main article on the topic . The Times and Forbes noted that Scientologist computers were used to remove links between the Church of Scientology and a former anti @-@ cult organization , since taken over by Scientology , the Cult Awareness Network . Der Spiegel reported that <unk> revealed Scientology computers were used to promote Scientology 's critical view of psychiatry , including adding links to the Scientology @-@ founded Citizens Commission on Human Rights ( CCHR ) and to websites of other groups affiliated with Scientology . 
 In January 2009 , The Register reported on a case involving Scientology before Wikipedia 's Arbitration Committee . The Arbitration Committee on Wikipedia is composed of a group of volunteers voted upon by other users in order to resolve conflict on the site . Wikipedia administrators presented evidence during the case that Scientology @-@ controlled computers were used to promote the organization , using multiple user accounts . One user going by the pseudonym " COFS " admitted this pattern of editing , and stated the edits from Scientology computers would continue . In May 2009 , the Arbitration Committee decided to restrict editing from IP addresses belonging to the Church of Scientology , to prevent biased edits by editors within Church of Scientology @-@ administered networks . The decision accorded Scientology @-@ controlled IP addresses the same <unk> status as open proxies on the site . A large number of Scientology critics were banned as well . The committee concluded that both sides had " gamed policy " and resorted to " battlefield tactics " , with articles on living persons being the " worst casualties " . 
 Arbitration Committee member Roger Davies wrote the majority of the decision , and commented to The New York Times that due to the controversial nature of the case , the decision was crafted so as not to focus directly upon any particular individual . Wikipedia media contact Dan Rosenthal emphasized in a statement to ABC News that it was generally accepted procedure on the site to ban users that had violated policy intended to prevent them from promoting propaganda . Wikimedia Foundation spokesman and head of communications Jay Walsh said to Bloomberg BusinessWeek the Arbitration decision was intended to help restore Scientology @-@ related articles to an acceptable state on the site . Wikimedia Germany spokesperson Catrin <unk> stated to <unk> that the decision impacted the English Wikipedia , and noted it was unclear whether a similar ruling might be applied to the German Wikipedia . Statements from Scientology spokeswoman Karin Pouw labelled the Arbitration ruling as a routine matter , and maintained there were still " gross inaccuracies " on the article on Scientology . In a statement to CNN , Pouw denied the presence of an organized campaign by the Church of Scientology to manipulate Wikipedia . Scientology representative Tommy Davis emphasized to the St. Petersburg Times that users critical of the organization were also banned , and similarly denied that Scientology leadership arranged a campaign to manipulate entries on Wikipedia .

 The Church of Scientology has a controversial history on the Internet . It has been criticized for attempting to restrict freedom of speech on the Internet ; this conflict has come to be known as Scientology versus the Internet , or Scientology v. The Net . The organization has attempted to manipulate and maintain power over its public image on the web . Early lawsuits involved in this dispute have included Religious Technology Center v. <unk> , as well as Religious Technology Center v. <unk> Net . Writing in his book , Cyber Rights : Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age , author Mike Godwin noted , " In one of the earliest widely publicized sets of cases involving intellectual property on the Net , the Church of Scientology has been exploring the uses of copyright and trade secret law when it comes to silencing its critics , many of them former members of the church . " The Guardian noted , " According to insiders and security experts , Scientologists have been conducting concerted campaigns for more than a decade to remove online information critical of the organisation . " In response to criticism over its actions on the Internet , Scientology has stated its efforts are aimed at defending the copyrights over its secretive spiritual documents . 
 Legal cases have involved a newsgroup focused on the topic called alt.religion.scientology , which revealed information from advanced Scientology methods including the Operating Thetan ( OT ) levels that describe the story of Xenu . In 1995 , attorneys representing the Church of Scientology tried to get alt.religion.scientology removed from Usenet . This maneuver had the opposite impact for Scientology , serving to drive up popularity of alt.religion.scientology and resulting in a " declaration of war " from the hacker organization Cult of the Dead Cow . Professor David S. <unk> of the computer science department and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , is a critic of Scientology and proponent of freedom of speech on the Internet . He noted the Scientology organization was , " trying to threaten freedom of speech on the Internet by making service providers legally responsible for their customers ' speech . " Wendy M. Grossman , journalist and founder of The Skeptic , observed of Scientology 's attempts to suppress information on the Internet , 
 " Scientology versus the Net ... was the original <unk> The story was at heart pretty simple ( and the skirmishes continue , in various translations into newer media , to this day ) . Scientology has a bunch of super @-@ secrets that only the initiates , who have spent many hours in expensive Scientology training , are allowed to see . Scientology 's attempts to keep those secrets off the Net resulted in their being published everywhere . The dust has never completely settled . 
 Three people can keep a secret if two of them are dead , said Mark Twain . That was before the Internet . Scientology was the first to learn – nearly 15 years ago – that the best way to ensure the maximum publicity for something is to try to suppress it . "

 Conflict within the topic of Scientology on Wikipedia arose early on from the website 's beginnings . Author Jonathan Zittrain noted in The Future of the Internet – And How to Stop It , his 2009 book published by Yale University Press , that " as Wikipedia grew it began to attract editors who had never crossed paths before , and who disagreed on articles they were simultaneously editing . One person would say that Scientology was a ' cult ' , the other would change that back to ' religion , ' and the first would revert it back again . " In a 2005 article about Wikipedia for The Guardian , Charles Arthur noted individuals debated online , " whether Scientology should be classed as a cult " , and he compared the " <unk> " of Scientology to that of Wikipedia itself . ABC News noted in a 2009 article , " Wikipedia disputes about Scientology have gone on since 2005 . " 
 In 2006 , conflict on Wikipedia within the topic of Scientology was drawn out over specific disagreements . Journalist Alan <unk> of McClatchy Newspapers reported in August 2006 , " Wayne <unk> , a Wikipedia spokesman , said debates on controversial topics can become incredibly time @-@ consuming and sometimes maddening . In the entry covering Scientology , for example , contributors argued for nine months over whether the Scientologist method of childbirth should be called ' silent birth ' or ' quiet birth . ' " In an October 2006 article about Wikipedia , Paul Vallely of The Independent commented that , " Some pages seem to have been taken over by fanatics and special interest groups ( try the Scientology page ) . " Wikipedia user and Scientology critic David Gerard commented to The Daily Telegraph in October 2006 about the state of Scientology articles on the site , saying " he believes the Wikipedia entry is the most balanced and informative account to be found anywhere on the web . " Gerard commented on " <unk> " ( neutral point of view ) in the topic , " This is a good example of why <unk> is one of the most revolutionary things about Wikipedia . On the web you 'll find a lot of Church of Scientology sites , and a lot of critics ' sites , which are generally very bitter . On Wikipedia you have to be neutral , and you have to be able to reference your facts . " 
 = = = WikiScanner revelations = = = 
 The development of the WikiScanner software by Virgil Griffith in 2007 revealed changes made to Wikipedia articles by Scientology organization computers . CBS News reported , " Many of the edits are predictably self @-@ interested : PCs in Scientology officialdom were used to remove criticism in the church 's Wikipedia entry . " The Independent noted , " Computers with IP addresses traced to the Church of Scientology were used to expunge critical paragraphs about the cult 's world @-@ wide operations . " The Times reported that a computer operated by the Church of Scientology was used to manipulate information in the Wikipedia article about the Cult Awareness Network , " A computer linked to the Church of Scientology 's network was used to delete references to links between it and a group dubbed the ' Cult Awareness Network . ' " Forbes noted , " Scientology officials appear to have removed critical comments from an anti @-@ cult organization . " 
 Der Spiegel reported in more depth on some of the edits revealed by <unk> to have been made on Wikipedia by computers associated with the Church of Scientology . From 2003 to 2007 , 170 edits were made , a large proportion of which focused on Scientologist views critical of psychiatry . The article " Kurt Cobain " was edited by Scientologists in order to include a link to the Scientology @-@ founded " Citizens Commission on Human Rights " ( CCHR ) ; and an edit to the article put forth the notion that , " the singer 's childhood Ritalin prescription led him to suicide " . Multiple edits involved adding links to webpages of organizations affiliated with Scientology . 
 Reporting for Slate , journalist Michael Agger observed that an edit by a Scientology @-@ associated IP address to a Scientology @-@ related article on Wikipedia does not necessarily indicate such an edit was made by an employee of the organization . Virgil Griffith explained , " Technically , we don 't know if it came from an agent of that company . However , we do know that edit came from someone with access to their network . If the edit occurred during working hours , then we can reasonably assume that the person is either an employee of that company or a guest that was allowed access to their network . "

 After the Scientology organization tried to remove a promotional film of Scientology featuring celebrity member Tom Cruise from the Internet , a group of web @-@ based activists known as " Anonymous " focused efforts against Scientology . Anonymous disrupted Scientology websites and spread anti @-@ Scientologist materials online . In July 2008 , Messenger Newspapers noted , " A war between internet collective Anonymous and the Church of Scientology " had been " fought out largely on the battlefields of YouTube , Wikipedia and other websites " , before emerging to become a movement with protests taking place in front of Scientology buildings . Known as Project Chanology , the movement was " Organised from a Wikipedia @-@ style website ( editable by anyone ) and through anonymous internet chat rooms " . The New York Times noted that through its actions related to attempts to remove the Tom Cruise video from the Internet , the Church of Scientology became a victim of the Streisand effect – a phenomenon whereby attempts to suppress information on the Internet end up having the opposite impact .

 In January 2009 , The Register reported on an ongoing case involving Scientology before Wikipedia 's Arbitration Committee , " According to site administrators , several pro @-@ Scientology accounts have been editing the site using Scientology @-@ owned computers . " The Arbitration Committee on Wikipedia is composed of a group of volunteers voted upon by other users in order to resolve conflict on the site . During the Arbitration case , the page about Scientology was modified by members of the organization . Scientology members had doctored entries in order to advertise for their cause . The Register noted that one of the Wikipedia users admitted he had edited from computers operated by the Scientology organization , " One of these pro @-@ Scientology editors – who once used the handle ' COFS ' – has admitted as much . And he vows to continue editing Scientology articles from Scientology computers . " The Register quoted the " COFS " user as saying , " I am not going to leave voluntarily and I will continue to use a ) my own computer , b ) public computers , c ) my wireless laptop , d ) computers in the Church of Scientology and any station I please " . The Guardian cited The Register , and noted , " The technology news website The Register alleges the church has an organised operation to challenge internet criticism . " 
 In an effort to adhere to Wikipedia policy , Wikipedia 's Arbitration Committee decided on May 28 , 2009 , to restrict editing from Scientology organization IP addresses in order to prevent self @-@ serving edits by editors within Church of Scientology @-@ administered networks . The decision accorded Scientology @-@ controlled IP addresses the same <unk> status as open proxies on the site . Ten members of the Arbitration Committee voted in favor of the ruling , thus preventing such users from editing existing articles or creating new articles on the site . Wikipedia previously frequently had banned individual users from the site , but not entire organizations . The Arbitration decision came as the culmination of a " longstanding struggle " involving promoters of the organization and critics of its practices . ABC News noted the conflict was " one of the longest @-@ running disputes in Wikipedia 's history " . The conflict involved over 400 articles within the topic of Scientology . It was the fourth such Arbitration Case before Wikipedia 's Arbitration Committee on the topic of Scientology in the prior four years . The case was drawn out for six months , prior to the decision of the Arbitration Committee . 
 The committee ruled that the Scientology organization had a responsibility to " ensure appropriate use of its servers and equipment " , and pointed to a conflict of interest involved with edits from Scientology @-@ associated computers . The block on IP addresses includes those originating from the Church of Scientology 's offices in Los Angeles , California ; the organization additionally maintains headquarters in Clearwater , Florida . 
 News.com.au reported , " According to evidence found by Wikipedia , multiple users with known scientology IP addresses had been ' openly editing ( Scientology @-@ related articles ) from Church of Scientology equipment and apparently coordinating their activities ' . " Sky News noted that the ban on Scientology computers applies to " Any computer addresses ' owned or operated ' by the Church or associates linked to it " . Fox News Channel reported on the decision , " The encyclopedia 's administrators found that Scientology computers had been repeatedly changing more than 400 pages related to the Church , deleting negative references and adding positive ones . The volume of changes was overwhelming administrators ' ability to reverse them , hence the block . " Fox News Channel described the decision by the Arbitration Committee to block Scientology @-@ controlled IP addresses as " an unprecedented move " ; The Guardian similarly noted , " whatever your feelings towards the world of Scientology , Wikipedia 's decision to enact a blanket ban appears to be unprecedented . " InfoWorld wrote that edits by the Scientology organization were motivated by , " a massive organized effort to make the CoS look good and / or counter the relentless public criticism that has shadowed the organization since the earliest days of the Net . " Wired News reported that the ban on the Scientology organization was triggered by " repeated and deceptive editing of articles related to the controversial religion " . The Los Angeles Times noted that the ban stemmed from " the church 's self @-@ serving wiki @-@ revisionism " . Der Spiegel noted that skeptics doubted the efficacy of the ban on the Scientology @-@ controlled IP addresses , and commented on the likelihood of individuals creating multiple account names . 
 A " host of anti @-@ Scientologist editors " were topic @-@ banned as well by the arbitration committee . The committee noted that an " aggravating factor " had been " the apparent presence of notable critics of Scientology , from several Internet organisations , apparently editing under their own names and citing either their own or each other 's self @-@ published material . " The committee concluded that both sides had " gamed policy " and resorted to " battlefield tactics " to create articles that were either " disparaging or complimentary " , with articles on living persons being the " worst casualties " .
