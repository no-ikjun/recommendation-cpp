 The nuclear fission properties of berkelium are different from those of the neighboring actinides curium and californium , and they suggest berkelium to perform poorly as a fuel in a nuclear reactor . Specifically , berkelium @-@ 249 has a moderately large neutron capture cross section of 710 barns for thermal neutrons , 1200 barns resonance integral , but very low fission cross section for thermal neutrons . In a thermal reactor , much of it will therefore be converted to berkelium @-@ 250 which quickly decays to californium @-@ 250 . In principle , berkelium @-@ 249 can sustain a nuclear chain reaction in a fast breeder reactor . Its critical mass is relatively high at 192 kg ; it can be reduced with a water or steel reflector but would still exceed the world production of this isotope . 
 Berkelium @-@ 247 can maintain chain reaction both in a thermal @-@ neutron and in a fast @-@ neutron reactor , however , its production is rather complex and thus the availability is much lower than its critical mass , which is about 75 @.@ 7 kg for a bare sphere , 41 @.@ 2 kg with a water reflector and 35 @.@ 2 kg with a steel reflector ( 30 cm thickness ) . 
 = = Health issues = = 
 Little is known about the effects of berkelium on human body , and analogies with other elements may not be drawn because of different radiation products ( electrons for berkelium and alpha particles , neutrons , or both for most other actinides ) . The low energy of electrons emitted from berkelium @-@ 249 ( less than 126 keV ) hinders its detection , due to signal interference with other decay processes , but also makes this isotope relatively harmless to humans as compared to other actinides . However , berkelium @-@ 249 transforms with a half @-@ life of only 330 days to the strong alpha @-@ emitter californium @-@ 249 , which is rather dangerous and has to be handled in a glove box in a dedicated laboratory . 
 Most available berkelium toxicity data originate from research on animals . Upon ingestion by rats , only about 0 @.@ 01 % berkelium ends in the blood stream . From there , about 65 % goes to the bones , where it remains for about 50 years , 25 % to the lungs ( biological half @-@ life about 20 years ) , 0 @.@ 035 % to the testicles or 0 @.@ 01 % to the ovaries where berkelium stays indefinitely . The balance of about 10 % is excreted . In all these organs berkelium might promote cancer , and in the skeletal system its radiation can damage red blood cells . The maximum permissible amount of berkelium @-@ 249 in the human skeleton is 0 @.@ 4 nanograms . 
 = Penrose tiling = 
 A Penrose tiling is an example of non @-@ periodic tiling generated by an aperiodic set of prototiles . Penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist Roger Penrose , who investigated these sets in the 1970s . The <unk> of prototiles implies that a shifted copy of a tiling will never match the original . A Penrose tiling may be constructed so as to exhibit both reflection symmetry and fivefold rotational symmetry , as in the diagram at the right . 
 A Penrose tiling has many remarkable properties , most notably : 
 It is non @-@ periodic , which means that it lacks any translational symmetry . 
 It is self @-@ similar , so the same patterns occur at larger and larger scales . Thus , the tiling can be obtained through " inflation " ( or " deflation " ) and any finite patch from the tiling occurs infinitely many times . 
 It is a <unk> : implemented as a physical structure a Penrose tiling will produce Bragg diffraction and its <unk> reveals both the fivefold symmetry and the underlying long range order . 
 Various methods to construct Penrose tilings have been discovered , including matching rules , substitutions or subdivision rules , cut and project schemes and coverings .

 = = = Periodic and aperiodic tilings = = = 
 Penrose tilings are simple examples of aperiodic tilings of the plane . A tiling is a covering of the plane by tiles with no overlaps or gaps ; the tiles normally have a finite number of shapes , called prototiles , and a set of prototiles is said to admit a tiling or tile the plane if there is a tiling of the plane using only tiles congruent to these prototiles . The most familiar tilings ( e.g. , by squares or triangles ) are periodic : a perfect copy of the tiling can be obtained by translating all of the tiles by a fixed distance in a given direction . Such a translation is called a period of the tiling ; more informally , this means that a finite region of the tiling repeats itself in periodic intervals . If a tiling has no periods it is said to be non @-@ periodic . A set of prototiles is said to be aperiodic if it tiles the plane but every such tiling is non @-@ periodic ; tilings by aperiodic sets of prototiles are called aperiodic tilings . 
 = = = Earliest aperiodic tilings = = = 
 The subject of aperiodic tilings received new interest in the 1960s when logician Hao Wang noted connections between decision problems and tilings . In particular , he introduced tilings by square plates with colored edges , now known as Wang dominoes or tiles , and posed the " Domino Problem " : to determine whether a given set of Wang dominoes could tile the plane with matching colors on adjacent domino edges . He observed that if this problem were undecidable , then there would have to exist an aperiodic set of Wang dominoes . At the time , this seemed implausible , so Wang conjectured no such set could exist . 
 Wang 's student Robert Berger proved that the Domino Problem was undecidable ( so Wang 's conjecture was incorrect ) in his 1964 thesis , and obtained an aperiodic set of <unk> Wang dominoes . He also described a reduction to 104 such prototiles ; the latter did not appear in his published monograph , but in 1968 , Donald Knuth detailed a modification of Berger 's set requiring only 92 dominoes . 
 The color matching required in a tiling by Wang dominoes can easily be achieved by modifying the edges of the tiles like jigsaw puzzle pieces so that they can fit together only as prescribed by the edge colorings . Raphael Robinson , in a 1971 paper which simplified Berger 's techniques and <unk> proof , used this technique to obtain an aperiodic set of just six prototiles . 
 = = = Development of the Penrose tilings = = = 
 The first Penrose tiling ( tiling P1 below ) is an aperiodic set of six prototiles , introduced by Roger Penrose in a 1974 paper , but it is based on pentagons rather than squares . Any attempt to tile the plane with regular pentagons necessarily leaves gaps , but Johannes Kepler showed , in his 1619 work Harmonices Mundi , that these gaps can be filled using pentagrams ( star polygons ) , <unk> and related shapes . Traces of these ideas can also be found in the work of Albrecht Dürer . Acknowledging inspiration from Kepler , Penrose found matching rules ( which can be imposed by decorations of the edges ) for these shapes , obtaining an aperiodic set . His tiling can be viewed as a completion of Kepler 's finite Aa pattern . 
 Penrose subsequently reduced the number of prototiles to two , discovering the kite and dart tiling ( tiling P2 below ) and the rhombus tiling ( tiling P3 below ) . The rhombus tiling was independently discovered by Robert Ammann in 1976 . Penrose and John H. Conway investigated the properties of Penrose tilings , and discovered that a substitution property explained their hierarchical nature ; their findings were publicized by Martin Gardner in his January 1977 " Mathematical Games " column in Scientific American . 
 In 1981 , De Bruijn explained a method to construct Penrose tilings from five families of parallel lines as well as a " cut and project method " , in which Penrose tilings are obtained as two @-@ dimensional projections from a five @-@ dimensional cubic structure . In this approach , the Penrose tiling is viewed as a set of points , its vertices , while the tiles are geometrical shapes obtained by connecting vertices with edges . 
 = = The Penrose tilings = = 
 The three types of Penrose tiling P1 – P3 are described individually below . They have many common features : in each case , the tiles are constructed from shapes related to the pentagon ( and hence to the golden ratio ) , but the basic tile shapes need to be supplemented by matching rules in order to tile aperiodically ; these rules may be described using labeled vertices or edges , or patterns on the tile faces – alternatively the edge profile can be modified ( e.g. by indentations and protrusions ) to obtain an aperiodic set of prototiles . 
 = = = The original pentagonal Penrose tiling ( P1 ) = = = 
 Penrose 's first tiling uses pentagons and three other shapes : a five @-@ pointed " star " ( a pentagram ) , a " boat " ( roughly 3 / 5 of a star ) and a " diamond " ( a thin rhombus ) . To ensure that all tilings are non @-@ periodic , there are matching rules that specify how tiles may meet each other , and there are three different types of matching rule for the pentagonal tiles . It is common to indicate the three different types of pentagonal tiles using three different colors , as in the figure above right . 
 = = = Kite and dart tiling ( P2 ) = = = 
 Penrose 's second tiling uses quadrilaterals called the " kite " and " dart " , which may be combined to make a rhombus . However , the matching rules prohibit such a combination . Both the kite and dart are composed of two triangles , called Robinson triangles , after 1975 notes by Robinson . 
 The kite is a quadrilateral whose four interior angles are 72 , 72 , 72 , and 144 degrees . The kite may be bisected along its axis of symmetry to form a pair of acute Robinson triangles ( with angles of 36 , 72 and 72 degrees ) . 
 The dart is a non @-@ convex quadrilateral whose four interior angles are 36 , 72 , 36 , and 216 degrees . The dart may be bisected along its axis of symmetry to form a pair of obtuse Robinson triangles ( with angles of 36 , 36 and 108 degrees ) , which are smaller than the acute triangles . 
 The matching rules can be described in several ways . One approach is to color the vertices ( with two colors , e.g. , black and white ) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices . Another is to use a pattern of circular arcs ( as shown above left in green and red ) to constrain the placement of tiles : when two tiles share an edge in a tiling , the patterns must match at these edges . 
 These rules often force the placement of certain tiles : for example , the concave vertex of any dart is necessarily filled by two kites . The corresponding figure ( center of the top row in the lower image on the left ) is called an " ace " by Conway ; although it looks like an enlarged kite , it does not tile in the same way . Similarly the concave vertex formed when two kites meet along a short edge is necessarily filled by two darts ( bottom right ) . In fact , there are only seven possible ways for the tiles to meet at a vertex ; two of these figures – namely , the " star " ( top left ) and the " sun " ( top right ) – have 5 @-@ fold dihedral symmetry ( by rotations and reflections ) , while the remainder have a single axis of reflection ( vertical in the image ) . All of these vertex figures , apart from the ace and the sun , force the placement of additional tiles . 
 = = = <unk> tiling ( P3 ) = = = 
 The third tiling uses a pair of <unk> ( often referred to as " rhombs " in this context ) with equal sides but different angles . Ordinary rhombus @-@ shaped tiles can be used to tile the plane periodically , so restrictions must be made on how tiles can be assembled : no two tiles may form a parallelogram , as this would allow a periodic tiling , but this constraint is not sufficient to force <unk> , as figure 1 above shows . 
 There are two kinds of tile , both of which can be decomposed into Robinson triangles . 
 The thin rhomb t has four corners with angles of 36 , 144 , 36 , and 144 degrees . The t rhomb may be bisected along its short diagonal to form a pair of acute Robinson triangles . 
 The thick rhomb T has angles of 72 , 108 , 72 , and 108 degrees . The T rhomb may be bisected along its long diagonal to form a pair of obtuse Robinson triangles ; in contrast to the P2 tiling , these are larger than the acute triangles . 
 The matching rules distinguish sides of the tiles , and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others . Two ways to describe these matching rules are shown in the image on the right . In one form , tiles must be assembled such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge . In the other , tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together . 
 There are 54 cyclically ordered combinations of such angles that add up to 360 degrees at a vertex , but the rules of the tiling allow only seven of these combinations to appear ( although one of these arises in two ways ) . 
 The various combinations of angles and facial curvature allow construction of arbitrarily complex tiles , such as the Penrose chickens . 
 = = Features and constructions = = 
 = = = The golden ratio and local pentagonal symmetry = = = 
 Several properties and common features of the Penrose tilings involve the golden ratio φ 
 = ( 1 + √ 5 ) / 2 ( approximately 1 @.@ 618 ) . This is the ratio of chord lengths to side lengths in a regular pentagon , and satisfies φ = 
 1 + 1 / φ . 
 Consequently , the ratio of the lengths of long sides to short sides in the ( isosceles ) Robinson triangles is φ : 1 . It follows that the ratio of long side lengths to short in both kite and dart tiles is also φ : 1 , as are the length ratios of sides to the short diagonal in the thin rhomb t , and of long diagonal to sides in the thick rhomb T. In both the P2 and P3 tilings , the ratio of the area of the larger Robinson triangle to the smaller one is φ : 1 , hence so are the ratios of the areas of the kite to the dart , and of the thick rhomb to the thin rhomb . ( Both larger and smaller obtuse Robinson triangles can be found in the pentagon on the left : the larger triangles at the top – the halves of the thick rhomb – have linear dimensions scaled up by φ compared to the small shaded triangle at the base , and so the ratio of areas is <unk> : 1 . ) 
 Any Penrose tiling has local pentagonal symmetry , in the sense that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles : such configurations have fivefold rotational symmetry about the center point , as well as five mirror lines of reflection symmetry passing through the point , a dihedral symmetry group . This symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point , but the patch can be very large : Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop , the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry , and furthermore , in any tiling , there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up . 
 There can be at most one center point of global fivefold symmetry : if there were more than one , then rotating each about the other would yield two closer centers of fivefold symmetry , which leads to a mathematical contradiction . There are only two Penrose tilings ( of each type ) with global pentagonal symmetry : for the P2 tiling by kites and darts , the center point is either a " sun " or " star " vertex . 
 = = = Inflation and deflation = = = 
 Many of the common features of Penrose tilings follow from a hierarchical pentagonal structure given by substitution rules : this is often referred to as inflation and deflation , or composition and decomposition , of tilings or ( collections of ) tiles . The substitution rules decompose each tile into smaller tiles of the same shape as those used in the tiling ( and thus allow larger tiles to be " composed " from smaller ones ) . This shows that the Penrose tiling has a scaling self @-@ similarity , and so can be thought of as a fractal . 
 Penrose originally discovered the P1 tiling in this way , by decomposing a pentagon into six smaller pentagons ( one half of a net of a dodecahedron ) and five half @-@ diamonds ; he then observed that when he repeated this process the gaps between pentagons could all be filled by stars , diamonds , boats and other pentagons . By iterating this process indefinitely he obtained one of the two P1 tilings with pentagonal symmetry . 
 = = = = Robinson triangle decompositions = = = = 
 The substitution method for both P2 and P3 tilings can be described using Robinson triangles of different sizes . The Robinson triangles arising in P2 tilings ( by bisecting kites and darts ) are called A @-@ tiles , while those arising in the P3 tilings ( by bisecting rhombs ) are called B @-@ tiles . The smaller A @-@ tile , denoted AS , is an obtuse Robinson triangle , while the larger A @-@ tile , AL , is acute ; in contrast , a smaller B @-@ tile , denoted BS , is an acute Robinson triangle , while the larger B @-@ tile , BL , is obtuse . 
 Concretely , if AS has side lengths ( 1 , 1 , φ ) , then AL has side lengths ( φ , φ , 1 ) . B @-@ tiles can be related to such A @-@ tiles in two ways : 
 If BS has the same size as AL then BL is an enlarged version <unk> of AS , with side lengths ( φ , φ , <unk> = 1 + φ ) – this decomposes into an AL tile and AS tile joined along a common side of length 1 . 
 If instead BL is identified with AS , then BS is a reduced version ( 1 / φ ) AL of AL with side lengths ( 1 / φ , 1 / φ , 1 ) – joining a BS tile and a BL tile along a common side of length 1 then yields ( a decomposition of ) an AL tile . 
 In these decompositions , there appears to be an ambiguity : Robinson triangles may be decomposed in two ways , which are mirror images of each other in the ( isosceles ) axis of symmetry of the triangle . In a Penrose tiling , this choice is fixed by the matching rules – furthermore , the matching rules also determine how the smaller triangles in the tiling compose to give larger ones . 
 It follows that the P2 and P3 tilings are mutually locally derivable : a tiling by one set of tiles can be used to generate a tiling by another – for example a tiling by kites and darts may be subdivided into A @-@ tiles , and these can be composed in a canonical way to form B @-@ tiles and hence rhombs . The P2 and P3 tilings are also both mutually locally derivable with the P1 tiling ( see figure 2 above ) . 
 The decomposition of B @-@ tiles into A @-@ tiles may be written 
 BS 
 = AL , BL = 
 AL + AS 
 ( assuming the larger size convention for the B @-@ tiles ) , which can be summarized in a substitution matrix equation : 
 <formula> 
 Combining this with the decomposition of enlarged <unk> @-@ tiles into B @-@ tiles yields the substitution 
 <formula> 
 so that the enlarged tile <unk> decomposes into two AL tiles and one AS tiles . The matching rules force a particular substitution : the two AL tiles in a <unk> tile must form a kite – thus a kite decomposes into two kites and a two half @-@ darts , and a dart decomposes into a kite and two half @-@ darts . Enlarged <unk> @-@ tiles decompose into B @-@ tiles in a similar way ( via <unk> @-@ tiles ) . 
 Composition and decomposition can be iterated , so that , for example 
 <formula> 
 The number of kites and darts in the nth iteration of the construction is determined by the nth power of the substitution matrix : 
 <formula> 
 where Fn is the nth Fibonacci number . The ratio of numbers of kites to darts in any sufficiently large P2 Penrose tiling pattern therefore approximates to the golden ratio φ . A similar result holds for the ratio of the number of thick rhombs to thin rhombs in the P3 Penrose tiling . 
 = = = = <unk> for P2 and P3 tilings = = = = 
 Starting with a collection of tiles from a given tiling ( which might be a single tile , a tiling of the plane , or any other collection ) , deflation proceeds with a sequence of steps called generations . In one generation of deflation , each tile is replaced with two or more new tiles that are scaled @-@ down versions of tiles used in the original tiling . The substitution rules guarantee that the new tiles will be arranged in accordance with the matching rules . Repeated generations of deflation produce a tiling of the original axiom shape with smaller and smaller tiles . 
 This rule for dividing the tiles is a subdivision rule . 
 = = = = Consequences and applications = = = = 
 Inflation and deflation yield a method for constructing kite and dart ( P2 ) tilings , or rhombus ( P3 ) tilings , known as up @-@ down generation . 
 The Penrose tilings , being non @-@ periodic , have no translational symmetry – the pattern cannot be shifted to match itself over the entire plane . However , any bounded region , no matter how large , will be repeated an infinite number of times within the tiling . Therefore , a finite patch cannot differentiate between the uncountably many Penrose tilings , nor even determine which position within the tiling is being shown . 
 This shows in particular that the number of distinct Penrose tilings ( of any type ) is uncountably infinite . Up @-@ down generation yields one method to parameterize the tilings , but other methods use Ammann bars , <unk> , or cut and project schemes .

 = = = <unk> coverings and quasicrystals = = = 
 In 1996 , German mathematician Petra <unk> demonstrated that a covering ( so called to distinguish it from a non @-@ overlapping tiling ) equivalent to the Penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if two kinds of overlapping regions are allowed . The decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches , and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring . A suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a Penrose ( P2 ) tiling . Similarly , a P3 tiling can be obtained by inscribing a thick rhomb into each decagon ; the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs . 
 These coverings have been considered as a realistic model for the growth of quasicrystals : the overlapping <unk> are ' quasi @-@ unit cells ' analogous to the unit cells from which crystals are constructed , and the matching rules maximize the density of certain atomic clusters . 
 = = = Related tilings = = = 
 The three variants of the Penrose tiling are mutually locally derivable . Selecting some subsets from the vertices of a P1 tiling allows to produce other non @-@ periodic tilings . If the corners of one pentagon in P1 are labeled in succession by 1 @,@ 3 @,@ 5 @,@ 2 @,@ 4 an unambiguous tagging in all the pentagons is established , the order being either clockwise or counterclockwise . Points with the same label define a tiling by Robinson triangles while points with the numbers 3 and 4 on them define the vertices of a Tie @-@ and @-@ <unk> tiling . 
 There are also other related <unk> tilings , such as the hexagon @-@ boat @-@ star and <unk> – Roth tilings . For instance , if the matching rules for the rhombus tiling are reduced to a specific restriction on the angles permitted at each vertex , a binary tiling is obtained . Its underlying symmetry is also fivefold but it is not a <unk> . It can be obtained either by decorating the rhombs of the original tiling with smaller ones , or by applying substitution rules , but not by de Bruijn 's cut @-@ and @-@ project method .

 The aesthetic value of tilings has long been appreciated , and remains a source of interest in them ; here the visual appearance ( rather than the formal defining properties ) of Penrose tilings has attracted attention . The similarity with some decorative patterns used in the Middle East has been noted ; the physicists Peter J. Lu and Paul Steinhardt have presented evidence that a Penrose tiling underlies some examples of medieval Islamic geometric patterns , such as tilings at the Darb @-@ e Imam shrine in Isfahan . 
 Drop City artist Clark <unk> used Penrose rhombs in artwork in 1970 - derived by projecting the rhombic <unk> shadow onto a plane observing the embedded " fat " <unk> and " skinny " <unk> which tile together to produce the non @-@ periodic tessellation .. Art historian Martin Kemp has observed that Albrecht Dürer sketched similar motifs of a rhombus tiling . 
 San Francisco 's new $ 4 @.@ 2 billion Transbay Transit Center is planned to have perforations in its exterior 's undulating white metal skin in the Penrose pattern . 
 The floor of the atrium of the Molecular and Chemical Sciences Building at the University of Western Australia is tiled with Penrose tiles . 
 The Andrew Wiles Building , the location of the Mathematics Department at the University of Oxford as of October 2013 , includes a section of Penrose tiling as the paving of its entrance . The pedestrian part of the street <unk> in Helsinki is paved using a form of Penrose tiling . The work was finished in 2014 .

 " City of Angels " is a song by American rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars , featured on their fourth studio album Love , Lust , Faith and Dreams ( 2013 ) . Written by lead vocalist Jared Leto , who also produced the song with Steve Lillywhite , " City of Angels " was inspired by Leto 's experience of living in Los Angeles with his family and was influenced by the city 's culture . Imbued with elements of <unk> as well as music from the 1980s , the track was cited as an example of the album 's variety and experimentation . It was one of the first songs to be written for Love , Lust , Faith and Dreams , but needed a long @-@ lasting recording process . 
 " City of Angels " was released as a promotional single in July 2013 in the United States , and was serviced to mainstream radio in Europe in October 2013 . It received general acclaim from music critics , who commended the composition , the lyrics , and Leto 's vocal performance . Following the release of Love , Lust , Faith and Dreams , the track appeared in the lower regions of the UK Rock Chart . When released as a single , it re @-@ entered the chart reaching number 21 , peaked at number eight on the Alternative Songs in the US , and experienced moderate success in some international markets due to digital sales from the album .

The song was engineered by Jamie Reed Schefman and mixed by Serban Ghenea . John Hanes engineered it for mixing at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach , Virginia . It was recorded at The International Centre for the Advancement of the Arts and Sciences of Sound in Los Angeles , California and mastered by Howie Weinberg and Dan Gerbarg at Howie Weinberg Mastering . Thirty Seconds to Mars unveiled six songs from their fourth studio album Love , Lust , Faith and Dreams , including " City of Angels " , during a preview held at the Electric Lady Studios in New York City on March 14 , 2013 . Shannon Leto revealed that it was the oldest song written for the album and took a long time to make . 
 While writing the song , Leto was influenced by the culture of Los Angeles and inspired by his relationship with it . He explained that pursuing his creative ambitions in Los Angeles had led to a " love / hate relationship " with the city . Leto told Interview magazine , " the song is about people coming to the City of Angels to live their dreams and to make their dreams their reality . It 's about how the other people they 've met in the city have helped them — you know , a group of people all kind of joining together into a community of outsiders , of mavericks , of freaks , of artists . It 's about coming to a place to do something different and something special . "

 " City of Angels " is a rock song with influences and elements from <unk> . It opens with an instrumental section and " gently burbling " synthesizers . It follows with the sounds of drum beats , including taiko drums , then transitions into a piano melody . After the first verse , the chorus follows , with Leto singing , " Lost in the City of Angels / Down in the comfort of strangers / I found myself in the fire burned hills / In the land of a billion lights " . During the bridge , he ornaments his vocal lines with melodic crescendos , affirming " I am home " . After the final chorus , the song reaches a drum @-@ heavy climax . Emily Zemler from Billboard cited " City of Angels " as an example of variety and experimentation in Love , Lust , Faith and Dreams . She described the song as a " pulsating , subtler track that employs a blipping electronic beat rather than the band 's usual rock backdrop " . 
 In a preview of the record , Jeff Benjamin from Fuse acknowledged the 1980s influences that resonated throughout the track and noted that " hard rock guitars and percussion come crashing in on the chorus . " Sarah O ' Hara , while reviewing Love , Lust , Faith and Dreams for Lowdown , compared the song to " Kings and Queens " , a track with a similar structure included on This Is War featuring sparse verses and slow atmospheric builds to the chorus . In an interview with Loudwire , Leto described " City of Angels " as a very personal song about a specific place . He said , " It 's the story of my brother and I going to Los Angeles to make our dreams come true . It 's a love letter to that beautiful and bizarre land . " Leto later explained that the song could refer to any place a person goes to fulfill his or her own dreams . Mary Ouellette , writing for Loudwire , felt that the song " tells a passionate tale of finding comfort in calling the city of Los Angeles home . "

 John Gentile from Rolling Stone was impressed with the song , noticing that it is built in volume and complexity until Leto " was yelling at the top of his lungs . " Reviewing the piano version of the song , Gentile commented that " it focuses on delicate piano until a breathy Leto gently enters and spins the tale of his decision to move to Los Angeles and his earliest days there . " He wrote that " the song rises and falls until finally , it locks into a snapping beat and Leto exclaims , ' I am home ! ' " Alex Lai from Contactmusic gave the song a positive review , finding the band in a " less aggressive mood " as they move toward " U2 @-@ style stadium rock " and Leto tones down his vocal delivery . Lai described it as " essentially a love song for the city of Los Angeles on which the sentiment seems genuine " . Alternative Addiction ranked " City of Angels " at number 11 on its list of the 100 Best Songs of 2014 . 
 Kaitlyn Hodnicki from Stature magazine noted the intimacy featured in the track despite its anthemic quality . She considered it " a major leap forward in terms of Jared Leto 's song writing " , saying that the lyrics " lay the often enigmatic frontman bare " as he pays homage to Los Angeles . She also felt that " Leto 's love of U2 is no secret and displayed to full effect in this uplifting song with the piano , electronics , vocals and drums all weaving together effortlessly . " In a mixed review , John Watt from Drowned in Sound called it a " soulless slab of soft @-@ rock " . Brent Faulkner from PopMatters wrote that the song " isn 't too shabby , filled with minimalistic ideas and pummeling drums . " Chris Maguire of AltSounds criticized the influences of U2 featured in the track , while Andy Baber from musicOMH called it a " corny ballad " which makes Thirty Seconds to Mars a " love @-@ them @-@ or @-@ hate @-@ them band " .

 In August 2013 , Jared Leto told MTV News that he was preparing to shoot a short film for " City of Angels " . While he did not reveal much about the music video concept , he added : " It 's going to be powerful and emotional and definitely something special . " The shooting took place from August 16 – 17 in Los Angeles , filming multiple monoliths and murals . Leto interviewed celebrities who joined the three members of Thirty Seconds to Mars in sharing their visions about Los Angeles . He also recruited Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe impersonators as well as homeless people in the production of the video . After filming , Leto talked about the inspiration behind the video , stating , " Telling stories is a big part of what I do , so it was a really natural and comfortable thing . I think because I did all the interviews myself — I talked to fellow artists and they felt really comfortable . They shared a side of themselves that we don 't share very often . " Footage from the song 's lyric video , which was shot atop the Hollywood Hills , was used for a part of the short film that featured Leto singing the song against the backdrop of a Los Angeles sunset . 
 The short film was produced by Emma Ludbrook , Allan Wachs and Jared Leto , who also directed . Although it is billed as a " Bartholomew Cubbins Film " ( Leto 's longtime pseudonym ) , " City of Angels " is the first directorial project directly credited to Jared Leto . He explained , " It was the first time I 'd ever done that . I 'd used several different names , but it was just such a personal thing . I thought it was appropriate to put my name on that piece . " Previous collaborator <unk> <unk> served as director of photography . It was edited by Leto , Benjamin <unk> and Mischa Meyer . The short film included commentary from Kanye West , Christopher Lloyd Dennis , Juliette Lewis , Heather <unk> , Haywood , Lindsay Lohan , Olivia Wilde , Steve Nash , Ashley Olsen , Lily Collins , James Franco , Selena Gomez , Alan Cumming , Anthony Warfield , Jovan Rameau , Holly Beavon , Shaun White , Corey Feldman , and <unk> . " City of Angels " marked the second collaboration of Thirty Seconds to Mars with Kanye West , as they first worked together on the track " Hurricane " ( 2010 ) .

Individual clips featuring previously unseen interview footage of Kanye West , James Franco and Selena Gomez debuted in the following months . 
 In a press release , Jared Leto explained the meaning behind the music video : " ' City of Angels ' is a short film about this wild , weird , and wonderful land , Los Angeles , California . A place that has left its mark on the world 's imagination and a place where dreams can actually come true . I made this short film so I could share my thoughts on this incredibly special place and talk to others about theirs . It 's not so much about this particular city but more about the people who inhabit it . " He further said , " It 's a story about hope and dreams . It 's a story about people making the impossible possible — whether it 's Kanye West , James Franco , or a kid who 's living on the streets on Hollywood Boulevard . It 's a story about survival and about what it takes to become who you really want to be . "

 The short film begins with Kanye West relating objects and people with Los Angeles , including James Dean and Howard Hughes as well as architecture , Walt Disney and Marilyn Monroe . He is followed by a series of commentary from several residents discussing their relationship with Los Angeles while some of the city 's most iconic landmarks are shown . From the Hollywood Hills to Hollywood Boulevard , the short film captures the struggle of entertainers from the streets to the big screen . 
 A homeless man named Haywood opens up , " I didn 't know it was the city of angels , I thought it was the lost angels , the city of lost souls . " Tomo Miličević follows , explaining that " it 's the place where I came and the dreams did come true . " Jared Leto confesses , " I wouldn 't have anything if it wasn 't for this city " , while Shannon says , " I came out here and I kind of found a life . " Kanye West acknowledges conflicted feelings about Los Angeles , where his mother died and his daughter was born . Recalling her first impressions of the city , Olivia Wilde says , " I thought it was the most magical place I 'd ever been . It 's the promised land . " After the opening sequences , the song " City of Angels " begins , with Thirty Seconds to Mars performing atop the Hollywood Hills overlooking the city . 
 Clips of Marilyn Monroe , James Dean and Elisabeth Taylor are shown before the music stops with Christopher Lloyd Dennis , a Superman impersonator , who proclaims , " Hollywood is a land of dreams . And it 's also a land of broken dreams . " Jovan Rameau , a Michael Jackson impersonator , talks about coming to the United States on a boat as a Haitian refugee hoping to achieve the American Dream . He is followed by confessions by several personalities , including a silver man and a porn actress . Haywood explains that he arrived in Los Angeles while searching for his mother , only to find her living on the street . Lindsay Lohan reveals that she disappointed herself , while Selena Gomez addresses the role that Disney has played in her life . 
 After the second verse of the song begins , childhood pictures of Jared and Shannon with their mother Constance are shown .

As the song ends , Christopher Lloyd Dennis sums up , " Do I think I 'm gonna make it in the industry ? As long as I keep believing , it will happen . " The short film ends with the various personalities introducing themselves .

 Upon its release , the video received universal acclaim from contemporary music critics . Lindsey Weber of Vulture called the short film a " strangely moving ode to Los Angeles " . Markos Papadatos from Digital Journal rated it an A + and wrote , " Just when you thought that Jared Leto and Thirty Seconds to Mars cannot possible [ sic ] get any better , they prove us wrong " with their music video for " City of Angels " . He found it " raw and captivating " and felt that " it will certainly move people . " Brenna Ehrlich from MTV commented that while the short film " may lack all the majestic animals " featured in the music video for " Up in the Air " , " it does have some exotic animals of a different sort : a whole pack of celebrities . " Liza Darwin from Nylon magazine opened her review by writing , " There are music videos , and then there are Thirty Seconds to Mars music videos . " She stated , " Part documentary , part cinematic music video , this Jared Leto @-@ helmed mini @-@ film is touching , sweet , and totally worth watching in its 11 @-@ minute entirety . " 
 Sophie Schillaci , writing for The Hollywood Reporter , noticed the simplicity of the video and lauded its atmosphere . Anna Job from <unk> commented that the " cinematography is notable , featuring panoramic shots of Jared Leto serenading the city from the same perch they used in ' Kings and Queens ' . " Niki Crux from The Inquisitr gave a positive review and wrote , " Showcasing mini profiles on Hollywood 's largest icons , and lowest casualties , Jared Leto shines his camera on every facet that makes up Los Angeles . The video at times feels like a tribute to Los Angeles , but it never glosses over the turmoil that ensues in the City of Angels . " 
 Allison <unk> from MuchMusic was impressed with the video , calling it a " moving short film " . She wrote , " As an ode to Los Angeles , the band brought together what is most simply described as a diverse group of people to talk about their feelings towards the famous city . From street performers to homeless youth to some of the most famous celebrities in the world , Thirty Seconds to Mars compiled a panel that concisely and visually demonstrate the extreme highs and lows of Los Angeles in eleven minutes . " Luke O 'Neil from MTV noted that " interspersed with the real celebrities are a series of celebrity impersonators , which only heightens the underlying conceit about the fuzzy intersection of dreams and reality . That 's the idea of Los Angeles " . Emily Wright from The Boston Globe noticed the " raw , personal side to some of today 's most popular celebrities " featured . Scott Sterling of CBS News called it a " compelling examination on life in Los Angeles " . 
 On July 17 , 2014 , the video received a nomination in the category of Best Cinematography at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards , but lost to " Pretty Hurts " by Beyoncé . It became the second consecutive nomination for cinematographer David Devlin , who also contended in 2013 for " Up in the Air " . " City of Angels " received Best Rock Video at the Loudwire Music Awards on February 11 , 2014 . It was also nominated for Best Video at the 2014 Kerrang ! Awards , but lost to " Boston Square " by Deaf Havana .

 " City of Angels " was first performed at special concerts , dubbed as Church of Mars , in May 2013 , shortly before the release of the album . It later became a signature part of the Love , Lust , Faith and Dreams Tour which followed . During the tour 's first three legs , the song was usually performed with musicians playing taiko drums . The set 's video screen displayed shots from the song 's music video , which were accompanied by the stage 's LED video curtains . Fans and critics responded favorably to the song in a live setting . Curtis <unk> , writing for the Aesthetic Magazine Toronto , opined that the band " turned up the energy " with tracks like " City of Angels " . Ben Jolley from the Nottingham Post found it " inspirational " , while Jay Cridlin of the Tampa Bay Times called it " epic " . Thirty Seconds to Mars performed " City of Angels " at multiple major festivals , including Rock Werchter , Pinkpop , Rock am Ring and Rock im Park , which saw the band playing as headline act .

The performance received a standing ovation from the audience ; Jessica Hyndman from MTV deemed it a highlight of the show . A Digital Journal writer commented that the band delivered an " exceptional rendition " of the song and displayed " a great deal of charisma and energy that was equal in excellence to a live U2 performance " .

 = The Beginning ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " The Beginning " is the first episode of the sixth season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on November 8 , 1998 in the United States . The episode was written by Chris Carter , and directed by Kim Manners . The episode helps explore the series ' overarching mythology . " The Beginning " earned a Nielsen household rating of 11 @.@ 9 , being watched by 20 @.@ 34 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received mixed reviews from television critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In the episode , Mulder and Scully eagerly hunt for a deadly creature in the Arizona desert . What they find seems to support Mulder ’ s revived belief in aliens , but is discredited when the agents are not reassigned to the now re @-@ opened X @-@ Files , with Jeffrey Spender ( Chris Owens ) and Diana Fowley ( Mimi Rogers ) taking over instead . 
 " The Beginning " was the first episode of the series to not be filmed in Vancouver , Canada , after production was moved to Los Angeles at the behest of lead actor David Duchovny . The episode follows directly from The X @-@ Files feature film ( 1998 ) . The writers sought to bring back characters , such as Spender , Fowley , and Gibson Praise ( Jeff Gulka ) who had not been featured in the movie , but had played a pivotal role in the show 's fifth season . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Phoenix , Arizona , a scientist working for Roush Industries is exposed to the black oil alien @-@ virus and an alien gestates and bursts from his body the next morning . A few hours after his death , a co @-@ worker who arrives at his house is attacked and killed by the newborn alien . 
 In Washington , D.C. , Agent Fox Mulder appears before an FBI panel regarding his experiences in Antarctica . Meanwhile , The Smoking Man ( William B. Davis ) reports to the Syndicate on the alien in Phoenix , confident that he 'll be able to kill it . Assistant Director Walter Skinner tells Mulder , who is working on restoring the burned X @-@ Files , that Mulder and Scully have been denied reassignment on the X @-@ Files , but that Mulder should seek out a folder left on the desk in his old office . Mulder goes there , only to discover that Jeffrey Spender and Diana Fowley have been assigned to the X @-@ Files . Feeling betrayed by Fowley , Mulder leaves , but not before stealthily taking the folder with him . 
 The Smoking Man seeks Gibson Praise , who is undergoing brain surgery at that very moment . Mulder and Scully head to the home where the alien gestated , finding an alien 's nail in the wall . The Smoking Man arrives soon after with Gibson , who tells him that the alien is no longer there . At the nuclear power plant , the alien kills another person , but Mulder and Scully are denied access by Spender and Fowley . Upon returning to their car they find Gibson inside , who has escaped from The Smoking Man . Later that night , Fowley tells Mulder she was offered the X @-@ Files and is protecting his interest . Mulder leaves Gibson with Scully and heads off with her . Mulder and Fowley believe the alien is seeking heat , which is why it is in the nuclear power plant . Inside they find organic material on the ground and cooling pipes . 
 Scully brings Gibson to the hospital , where it is determined that he has the alien virus in his blood . The Black @-@ Haired Man ( Scott <unk> ) kidnaps him soon after , and brings him to the power plant . They find the alien , who attacks the Black @-@ Haired Man but not Gibson , as witnessed by Mulder from outside the locked door . Mulder and Scully are ordered to not associate with the X @-@ Files and are reassigned under Assistant Director Kersh . Spender is visited by The Smoking Man in his office . Mulder continues to work on restoring the X @-@ Files , and is told by Scully that Fowley 's report does not reflect what really happened . Scully tells Mulder that the alien virus DNA is also part of all human DNA , but in Gibson the DNA is active . In the power plant , Gibson is trapped inside with the alien , who sheds its skin , revealing the traditional grey alien form .

 " The Beginning " was the first episode to be filmed in Los Angeles , California . The move was instigated by David Duchovny , who portrayed Mulder , in order to ease his opportunity to find movie work as well as to give him a chance to be nearer to his wife , Téa Leoni . Series creator Chris Carter opposed the move , but Fox network officials eventually made the decision to film in California . Indeed , the very first shot of the episode — a long look into the sun — was intended by Carter to " boldly announce the show 's arrival in Southern California " . As a result of the move , the episode featured a largely new group of crew members , hired by Carter , Frank Spotnitz and new co @-@ executive producer Michael Watkins . The show 's crew had to spend five weeks unpacking and cataloging material from the Vancouver film crew . Although the move was unpopular with some members of the cast and crew , both series director Kim Manners and Gillian Anderson supported the move , although less vocally than Duchovny . 
 However , because of the shift , many fans of the series were alienated , due to the different tone taken by the show after its move to Los Angeles . Many fans accused the show of " Hollywood @-@ izing " by adding notable guests stars as well as making the plots simpler and more enjoyable for mass audiences . In addition , Space.com reported that many fans of the show loved " the moody ambiance filming around Vancouver lent the series [ during seasons 1 – 5 ] " , which the sixth season reportedly lacked . 
 = = = Writing and filming = = = 
 Spotnitz found that the main problem with developing the episode was segueing from a movie that some — but not necessarily all — viewers had seen . The writers sought to bring back characters like Gibson Praise , Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender who were not in the movie . In addition , the writers also wanted to bring back elements that were also seen in the movie , like the alien . Carter claims to have been thinking about what the episode would entail almost two years prior , when he was working on developing The X @-@ Files movie . The character Sandy , who is killed in the teaser sequence , was played by the show 's casting director Rick Millikan on the request of Carter . Millikan later joked that he spent most of the shoot on his cell phone casting other individuals for other X @-@ Files episodes . One of the nuclear power plant workers is named Homer , a reference to Homer Simpson , one of the main characters from the animated Fox television series The Simpsons . 
 The nuclear power plant in the episode was filmed at a facility run by Southern California Edison in Long Beach , California . Due to a heat wave , many of the scenes ended up being filmed in temperatures over 100 degrees and many lines had to be later re @-@ recorded by the actors . The scenes in an Arizona suburb were filmed in Valencia , California , because the producers wanted " something really Edward Scissorhands . " The underwater scenes with the alien were filmed in a Marina Del Rey Water tank used frequently by the show Baywatch . Filming the scenes in and around the power plant proved to be troublesome . Most of the sequences with the alien had to be shot multiple times due to the skin @-@ molting effects on the creature and problems with the nuclear power plant set . Certain scenes were not finished until late October — nearly two months after principal filming ended . 
 = = Broadcast and reception = = 
 " The Beginning " first aired in the United States on November 8 , 1998 . This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 11 @.@ 9 , with a 17 share , meaning that roughly 11 @.@ 9 percent of all television @-@ equipped households , and 17 percent of households watching television , were tuned in to the episode . It was viewed by 20 @.@ 34 million viewers and was the second highest rated episode of the sixth season . The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on March 7 , 1999 and received 1 @.@ 08 million viewers , making it the second most watched episode that week . Fox promoted the episode with the tagline " The new beginning . " The episode was later included on The X @-@ Files Mythology , Volume 3 – Colonization , a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien Colonist 's plans to take over the earth . 
 Critical reception to the episode was divided , as reviews ranged from largely positive to negative . In the book The End and the Beginning : The Official Guide to The X @-@ Files , Vol . 5 , author Andy Meisler noted that some fans and critics responded positively to " The Beginning , " most notably because the episode functioned as " a particularly artful and effective way to launch the series 's new season — and era . " Tom Kessenich , in his book Examination : An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6 – 9 of the X @-@ Files wrote positively of the episode , saying " ' The Beginning ' was a pretty good premiere episode . I was quite pleased to see how Chris Carter took last season 's finale and the movie and tied things together to get Season 6 off to a fresh start . " Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave it a B. He praised the performance of Chris Owens , noting that he was " acting the shit out of Spender " . Despite this , however he called the episode " lackluster " and noted that it " isn ’ t a great episode of the show , but it works well enough " . VanDerWerff 's main issue with the entry was that it chose to close off the events of the fifth season finale , but did little to expand upon the revelations of the series ' feature film . VanDerWerff also criticized the fact that Scully was , once again , a skeptic in the paranormal after all she saw . 
 Not all reviews were positive , however . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode one star out of five , writing that " ' The Beginning ' opens witty enough [ … ] and then offers the viewer no substance . It 's a better season opener than ' Redux ' [ … ] but it 's still very poor . " Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . She derided the episode 's plot , noting that the episode was " another mile down the X @-@ Files Road of Mythology . Monster aliens ? This is something out of a schlocky pulp novel with the science of the show dissolved into complete technobabble " . 
 = Golden Sun = 
 Golden Sun ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> no Taiyō : <unk> Fūin , " Golden Sun : The Opened Seal " ) is the first installment in a series of fantasy role @-@ playing video games developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Nintendo . It was released in November 2001 for Nintendo 's Game Boy Advance and was followed by a sequel , Golden Sun : The Lost Age , in 2002 . The game is notable for certain distinctive game elements , such as the use of special " Djinn " that empower the player and can be used against enemies . 
 Golden Sun 's story follows a band of magic @-@ attuned " Adepts " whose purpose , as it is revealed early on , is to protect the world of Weyard from alchemy , a potentially destructive power that was sealed away long ago . During their quest , the Adepts gain new abilities ( called Psynergy ) , assist others , and learn more about why alchemy was sealed away . The story continues in The Lost Age , this time from the perspective of the antagonists . 
 The game was highly praised by critics ; IGN 's Craig Harris said that Golden Sun could " arguably be one of the best 2D @-@ based Japanese RPGs created for any system . " The game has sold more than one million copies in Japan and the United States . A third game in the series , Golden Sun : Dark Dawn , was released in 2010 . Golden Sun was re @-@ released for the Virtual Console via the Wii U eShop in April 2014 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Golden Sun is a contemporary presentation of the traditional role @-@ playing video game formula , in which the player controls a cast of four characters as they journey through a fantasy @-@ themed world , interact with other characters , battle monsters , acquire increasingly powerful abilities and equipment , and take part in an ongoing narrative . Although many of the player 's actions are compulsory , Golden Sun often allows the player to visit previous locations and complete certain objectives out of order . 
 Much of the time spent outside of battle takes place in dungeons , caves , and other locales , which often feature puzzles integrated into their layout . These puzzles require the player to perform a variety of actions , such as creating makeshift bridges by pushing logs into rivers , or shifting the track of a mine cart to gain access to new areas . Many of these puzzles require use of the game 's form of magic spells , " Psynergy " ( " Energy " in the Japanese version ) ; this is in contrast to many RPGs , which often restrict magic to within battles and post @-@ combat healing . Psynergy , however , is used for both purposes ; for example , the " Whirlwind " spell that damages enemies in battle is also used out of battle to remove overgrown foliage blocking the player 's path . Psynergy comes in four elements : Venus ( manipulation of rocks and plants ) , Mars ( revolving around fire and heat ) , Jupiter ( based on wind and electricity ) , and Mercury ( concerning water and ice ) . Players can return to previous locations in the game to finish puzzles which they could not solve earlier because of the lack of a specific Psynergy spell . 
 = = = Battle and Djinn = = = 
 Golden Sun contains both random monster encounters , featuring randomly selected enemies , and compulsory boss battles that advance the story . When a battle begins , a separate screen is brought up in which the player 's party faces off against the enemy . During a battle , the characters and the background rotate to offer a pseudo @-@ 3D effect . In each battle , players must defeat the enemies while keeping their own party alive through items and Psynergy that restore life and supplement defense . The player receives a " Game Over " if each character 's hit points are reduced to zero ; if this happens , the player will incur a monetary penalty and the party will be returned to the sanctum in the last visited town . After winning a battle , players receive experience points , coins , and occasionally items . 
 Golden Sun also features an optional battling mode accessible from the menu screen . In this mode , players can enter a team from their saved game files into an arena environment where they battle increasingly difficult CPU @-@ controlled enemies . Additionally , players can select three of their four characters to fight another player 's three @-@ character team . The player does not receive any reward or punishment for participating in these battles . 
 One of the most distinctive features of Golden Sun is the collection and manipulation of creatures called Djinn . The Djinn are scattered in hiding throughout the game ; once found , they can be allocated to each character . They form the basis of the game 's statistic enhancement , as well as the system that dictates the character 's Psynergy capabilities . Attaching different Djinn to different characters modifies that character 's character class , subsequently modifying hit points , Psynergy points , and other statistics , as well as determining what Psynergy the character is able to perform . 
 Djinn can either be " Set " to a player or put on " Standby " . When a Djinni is Set , it gives bonuses to the stats of the character it is on , and may change the character ′ s class or usable Psynergy . Set Djinn also have abilities that can be used in battle to attack , heal , or otherwise affect the battle , however using these abilities causes the Djinn to move from being Set to being in Standby mode . There are seven Djinn of each element , and these Djinn can be mixed and matched to the four characters , allowing a large array of possible class setups and a variety of combat options . 
 In combat , a Djinni has several uses . Each Set Djinni has a special ability which can be invoked during combat by the character it is attached to , which can include enhanced elemental attacks , buffing / <unk> spells , healing / restoration spells , and other effects . After a successful invoke , the Djinni shifts to " Standby " mode until it is " Set " on the character again . While in standby , the Djinn do not contribute to statistics or change character classes , but can be used for summon spells , which are attacks where the player summons a powerful elemental monster to inflict damage on every enemy and increases the respective characters affinity for that element for a duration . This is the game 's most powerful method of attack , but the required switch to Standby mode is a risky trade @-@ off : Djinn used for summoning must rest for several turns before reverting to the Set position , during which time they cannot bolster statistics or classes . There are sixteen Summon Sequences in Golden Sun — four for each element — and each summon sequence requires between one and four Djinn of the same element on Standby .

 Golden Sun takes place in the fantasy world of " Weyard " — a massive , earth @-@ like environment with several major continents and oceans . It is revealed in the game 's sequel , Golden Sun : The Lost Age , that the setting is based on the flat Earth concept ; it is a flat , roughly elliptical plane whose oceans perpetually spill off the edge of the world 's perimeter into an endless abyss . The plot progression of Golden Sun spans the two largest continents in the world 's central region : <unk> to the north and <unk> to the south . 
 Weyard is governed by the mythological concept of the classical elements . All matter on Weyard consists of any combination of the four base elements : Venus , Mars , Mercury and Jupiter , or earth , fire , water , and wind , respectively . These four building blocks of reality can be manipulated by the omnipotent force of Alchemy , which reigned supreme in the world 's ancient past . Alchemy was sealed away in the past , however , and the world in the present age has become seemingly devoid of this power . However , in various places throughout the world , people demonstrate an aptitude to manipulate one of the elements through a form of magic called Psynergy . These wielders of Psynergy , called Adepts , usually refrain from displaying their talents to outsiders .

 The player controls four characters in Golden Sun . Isaac , the game 's silent protagonist , is a seventeen @-@ year @-@ old Venus Adept from the village of Vale . Garet , a seventeen @-@ year @-@ old Mars Adept also from Vale , is Isaac 's closest companion . Ivan is a fifteen @-@ year @-@ old Jupiter Adept who has lived with a famous merchant in the town of Kalay his entire life . Mia , a sixteen @-@ year @-@ old Mercury Adept from the wintry town of <unk> , is a gentle healer from a heritage of Mercury Adept clansmen . A fifth character seen and playable in the game 's exposition sequence is the 17 @-@ year @-@ old Mars Adept Jenna , another childhood friend to Isaac . 
 The primary antagonists of the game are Saturos and Menardi , a pair of immensely powerful and talented Mars Adepts of a foreign race hailing from Prox , a town in Weyard 's frigid north . Their goal is to restore Alchemy to the world , and they are assisted by the powerful and mysterious Mercury Adept Alex , who is of the same heritage as Mia ; and Jenna 's older brother , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Venus Adept Felix , who is indebted to Saturos for saving Felix from death . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The prevalent force of Alchemy in Weyard 's ancient past enabled the development of great civilizations . However , this thriving period eventually gave way to worldwide conflict that subsided only with the sealing away of Alchemy . The keys to unlocking Alchemy , the four Elemental Stars which hold the pure power of the four elements , are hidden within the mountain shrine , Mt . Aleph , which in turn is guarded by the town of Vale at the mountain 's base . In the game 's prologue , Saturos and Menardi , with help from a raiding party , storm Mt . Aleph with the intention to seize the Elemental Stars for themselves . They fail to solve the riddles guarding the stars and are driven away by the mountain 's trap , a magically generated thunderstorm and rock slide . 
 Three years later , Isaac , Garet , and Jenna join their teacher , Kraden , in his research of Mt . Aleph . Their research coincides with a second raid of the sanctum by Saturos and Menardi , now assisted by Felix and Alex , who coerce Isaac into giving them three of the four stars . The volcano erupts before they can retrieve the final star , but before escaping they capture Jenna and Kraden as eventual bargaining chips . The guardian of Mt . Aleph , the Wise One , appears before Isaac and Garet and instructs them to prevent Saturos ' group from casting the Elemental Stars into their respective Elemental Lighthouses across Weyard ; if this happens , Alchemy will be restored and the period of instability will begin anew . 
 Isaac and Garet pursue Saturos ' group to the Mercury Lighthouse , joined by Ivan and Mia . Despite their best efforts , they fail to prevent Saturos from activating Mercury Lighthouse with the Mercury Star . Saturos ' group leaves for the next Lighthouse with Isaac 's party remaining in pursuit . In the ensuing chase , Isaac learns that Saturos has taken another Adept hostage : the female Jupiter Adept , Sheba . Saturos and Menardi activate the Venus Lighthouse with the Venus Star , and are confronted by Isaac 's party immediately thereafter . Attempting to annihilate their opponents , Saturos and Menardi magically merge to form a massive two @-@ headed dragon , but Isaac 's party slay Saturos and Menardi for good . The remnants of Saturos ' group , headed by Felix and Alex , continue their quest to light the remaining two Lighthouses , with Jenna , Sheba , and Kraden still with them . The game ends as Isaac 's party boards a ship and sail out into Weyard 's open seas to continue their mission .

 Camelot Software Planning spent between twelve and eighteen months developing Golden Sun , which is considered a long time for a handheld video game ; the finished product was described as a testament to the positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game . In August 2000 , Camelot showed an early but playable version at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan . North American <unk> received the game a few weeks before the release , and IGN noted that the experience of developing Shining Force for Sega helped Camelot develop a gripping RPG for the handheld . 
 Camelot originally planned to create a single title instead of a series , and in the extremely early stages of their project they had created a game design document for the one Golden Sun game to be on the Nintendo 64 console . When it became apparent the N64 was to be superseded by the Nintendo GameCube , Camelot shifted their focus to making a game on the handheld Game Boy Advance . Golden Sun was still intended to be a single game , but due to the hardware limitations of putting the game on a single Game Boy Advance cartridge and the developers ' own desire for what they wanted to do with the game , it was expanded to become two successive games , Golden Sun and Golden Sun : The Lost Age . Scenario writer Hiroyuki Takahashi and director Shugo Takahashi had previously designed Shining Force III , where the story involved playing through the perspectives of both the " good " and " bad " characters . Thinking that it was an effective way of conveying the full story of a fictional game world , they incorporated elements of this storytelling methodology into the two @-@ game setup of the Golden Sun series , having the player control the " good guys " in Golden Sun and some of the antagonists in The Lost Age . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Golden Sun sold 740 @,@ 000 copies in the United States and 338 @,@ 000 in Japan . It received critical acclaim ; the title is ranked 91 % and 90 % on the review score aggregator sites Metacritic and GameRankings , respectively . Many reviewers praised the game 's graphics , sound , and varied yet refined RPG gameplay , with particular emphasis on the Battle Mode and Djinn system . Certain critics felt that , despite the technical limitations of its 32 @-@ bit cartridge , the game 's graphical quality was still extremely high ; GameSpot wrote that " Golden Sun is a throwback to some of the SNES 's best . " Complaints generally focused on a perceived overuse of text dialogue in the game 's cutscenes — particularly during the prologue section . Some faulted the game for relying on the " wander around , get into a random battle , win battle , wander around , random battle , etc . " mechanics present in many other role @-@ playing games . 
 G4 TV stated , " It 's the best original ( <unk> ) GBA RPG to date " , while GamePro called it a " huge , fantastic , creative , and wickedly fun RPG that doesn 't seem to care that it 's ' just ' on a GBA " . Game Informer called Golden Sun " a visual treat " , and said that its graphics " would have amazed Super Nintendo owners back in the day " . Noting the game 's similarity to previous Japanese role @-@ playing games , the reviewers believed that it was " easily the best original RPG on the GBA " , and the " new ruler in the GBA RPG realm " . Advance compared the game to the Pokémon series , and considered its graphics " luscious " and sound " incredible [ and ] cinematic " . Despite describing its plot as " <unk> City " , the magazine hailed the game as " the best handheld role @-@ player ever " . 
 In 2001 , Golden Sun won the Nintendo Power Award for best Game Boy Advance game of the year . Golden Sun was ranked 94 on IGN 's Readers Choice Top 100 games ever . In 2007 , it was named 24th best Game Boy Advance game in IGN 's feature reflecting on the Game Boy Advance 's long lifespan ; the website also named it Game of the Month for April 2003 because it had " amazing graphics and sound presentation , as well as a quest that lasts for more than thirty hours . " It was rated the 31st best game made on a Nintendo system in Nintendo Power 's Top 200 Games list . 
 = European nightjar = 
 The European nightjar , Eurasian nightjar or just nightjar ( Caprimulgus europaeus ) is a crepuscular and nocturnal bird in the nightjar family that breeds across most of Europe and temperate Asia . The Latin generic name refers to the old myth that the nocturnal nightjar suckled goats , causing them to cease to give milk . The six subspecies differ clinally , the birds becoming smaller and paler towards the east of the range . All populations are migratory , wintering in sub @-@ Saharan Africa . Their densely patterned grey and brown plumage makes individuals difficult to see in the daytime when they rest on the ground or perch motionless along a branch , although the male shows white patches in the wings and tail as he flies at night . 
 The preferred habitat is dry , open country with some trees and small bushes , such as heaths , forest clearings or newly planted woodland . The male European nightjar occupies a territory in spring and advertises his presence with a distinctive sustained churring trill from a perch . He patrols his territory with wings held in a V and tail fanned , chasing intruders while wing @-@ clapping and calling . Wing clapping also occurs when the male chases the female in a spiralling display flight . The European nightjar does not build a nest , and its two grey and brown blotched eggs are laid directly on the ground ; they hatch after about 17 – 21 days and the downy chicks fledge in another 16 – 17 days . 
 The European nightjar feeds on a wide variety of flying insects , which it seizes in flight , often fly @-@ catching from a perch . It hunts by sight , silhouetting its prey against the night sky . Its eyes are relatively large , each with a reflective layer , which improves night vision . It appears not to rely on its hearing to find insects and does not echolocate . Drinking and bathing take place during flight . Although it suffers a degree of predation and parasitism , the main threats to the species are habitat loss , disturbance and a reduction of its insect prey through pesticide use . Despite population decreases , its large numbers and huge breeding range mean that it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The nightjars , <unk> , are a large family of mostly nocturnal insect @-@ eating birds . The largest and most widespread genus is Caprimulgus , characterised by stiff bristles around the mouth , long pointed wings , a comb @-@ like middle claw and patterned plumage . The males , and sometimes females , often have white markings in the wing or tail . Within the genus , the European nightjar forms a superspecies with the rufous @-@ cheeked nightjar and the sombre nightjar , African species with similar songs . It is replaced further east in Asia by the jungle nightjar which occupies similar habitat . 
 The European nightjar was described by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 under its current scientific name . Caprimulgus is derived from the Latin <unk> , " nanny goat " , and <unk> , " to milk " , referring to an old myth that nightjars suck milk from goats , and the species name , europaeus is Latin for " European " . The common name " nightjar " , first recorded in 1630 , refers to the nocturnal habits of the bird , the second part of the name deriving from the distinctive churring song . Old or local names refer to the song , " churn owl " , habitat , " fern owl " , diet , " dor hawk " and " moth hawk " . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 There are six recognised subspecies , although the differences are mainly clinal ; birds become smaller and paler in the east of the range and the males have larger white wing spots . Birds of intermediate appearance occur where the subspecies ' ranges overlap . 
 The fossil record is deficient , but it is likely that these poorly defined subspecies diverged as global temperature rose over the last 10 @,@ 000 years or so . Only one record of the species possibly dates back to the late Eocene . 
 = = Description = = 
 The European nightjar is 24 @.@ 5 – 28 cm ( 9 @.@ 6 – 11 @.@ 0 in ) long , with a 52 – 59 cm ( 20 – 23 in ) wingspan . The male weighs 51 – 101 g ( 1 @.@ 8 – 3 @.@ 6 oz ) and the female 67 – 95 g ( 2 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 4 oz ) . The adult of the nominate subspecies has greyish @-@ brown upperparts with dark streaking , a pale buff hindneck collar and a white <unk> line . The closed wing is grey with buff spotting , and the underparts are greyish @-@ brown , with brown barring and buff spots . The bill is blackish , the iris is dark brown and the legs and feet are brown . 
 The flight on long pointed wings is <unk> , due to their soft plumage , and very buoyant . Flying birds can be sexed since the male has a white wing patch across three primary feathers and white tips to the two outer tail feathers , whereas females do not show any white in flight . Chicks have downy brown and buff plumage , and the fledged young are similar in appearance to the adult female . Adults moult their body feathers from June onwards after breeding , suspend the process while migrating , and replace the tail and flight feathers on the wintering grounds . Moult is completed between January and March . Immature birds follow a similar moult strategy to the adults unless they are from late broods , in which case the entire moult may take place in Africa . 
 Other nightjar species occur in parts of the breeding and wintering ranges . The red @-@ necked nightjar breeds in Iberia and northwest Africa ; it is larger , greyer and longer winged than the European nightjar , and has a broad buff collar and more conspicuous white markings on the wings and tail . Wintering European nightjars in Africa may overlap with the related rufous @-@ cheeked and sombre nightjars . Both have a more prominent buff hind @-@ neck collar and more spotting on the wing coverts . The sombre nightjar is also much darker than its European cousin . Given their nocturnal habits , cryptic plumage and difficulty of observation , nightjar observation " is as much a matter of fortune as effort or knowledge " . 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 The male European nightjar 's song is a sustained churring trill , given continuously for up to 10 minutes with occasional shifts of speed or pitch . It is delivered from a perch , and the male may move around its territory using different song posts . Singing is more frequent at dawn and dusk than during the night , and is reduced in poor weather . The song may end with a bubbling trill and wing @-@ clapping , perhaps indicating the approach of a female . Migrating or wintering birds sometimes sing . Individual male nightjars can be identified by analysing the rate and length of the pulses in their songs . Even a singing male may be hard to locate ; the perched bird is difficult to spot in low light conditions , and the song has a <unk> quality as the singer turns his head . The song is easily audible at 200 m ( 660 ft ) , and can be heard at 600 m ( 2 @,@ 000 ft ) in good conditions ; it can be confused with the very similar sound of the European mole cricket . 
 The female does not sing , but when on the wing , both sexes give a short <unk> , <unk> call , also used when chasing predators . Other calls include variations on a sharp chuck when alarmed , hisses given by adults when handled or chicks when disturbed , and an assortment of wuk , wuk , wuk , muffled oak , oak and murmurs given at the nest . Large young have a threat display with the mouth opened wide while hissing loudly . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The breeding range of the European nightjar comprises Europe north to around latitude 64 ° N and Asia north to about 60 ° N and east to Lake Baikal and eastern Mongolia . The southern limits are northwestern Africa , Iraq , Iran and the northwestern Himalayas . This nightjar formerly bred in Syria and Lebanon . 
 All populations are migratory , and most birds winter in Africa south of the Sahara , with just a few records from Pakistan , Morocco and Israel . Migration is mainly at night , singly or in loose groups of up to twenty birds . European breeders cross the Mediterranean and North Africa , whereas eastern populations move through the Middle East and East Africa . Some Asian birds may therefore cross 100 ° of longitude on their travels . Most birds winter in eastern or southeastern Africa , although individuals of the nominate race have been recently discovered wintering in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ; records elsewhere in West Africa may be wintering birds of this subspecies or C. e. meridionalis . Most autumn migration takes place from August to September , and the birds return to the breeding grounds by May . Vagrants have occurred in Iceland , the Faroe Islands , the Seychelles , the Azores , Madeira and the Canary Islands . 
 The European nightjar is a bird of dry , open country with some trees and small bushes , such as heaths , commons , moorland , forest clearings or felled or newly planted woodland . When breeding , it avoids treeless or heavily wooded areas , cities , mountains , and farmland , but it often feeds over wetlands , cultivation or gardens . In winter it uses a wider range of open habitats including acacia steppe , sandy country and highlands . It has been recorded at altitudes of 2 @,@ 800 m ( 9 @,@ 200 ft ) on the breeding grounds and 5 @,@ 000 m ( 16 @,@ 000 ft ) in the wintering areas . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 The European nightjar is crepuscular and nocturnal . During the day it rests on the ground , often in a partly shaded location , or perches motionless lengthwise along an open branch or a similar low perch . The cryptic plumage makes it difficult to see in the daytime , and birds on the ground , if they are not already in shade , will turn occasionally to face the sun thereby minimising their shadow . If it feels threatened , the nightjar flattens itself to the ground with eyes almost closed , flying only when the intruder is 2 – 5 m ( 7 – 16 ft ) away . It may call or wing clap as it goes , and land as far as 40 m ( 130 ft ) from where it was flushed . In the wintering area it often roosts on the ground but also uses tree branches up to 20 m ( 66 ft ) high . Roost sites at both the breeding and wintering grounds are used regularly if they are undisturbed , sometimes for weeks at a time . 
 Like other nightjars , it will sit on roads or paths during the night and hover to investigate large intruders such as deer or humans . It may be mobbed by birds while there is still light , and by bats , other nightjar species or Eurasian woodcocks during the night . Owls and other predators such as red foxes will be mobbed by both male and female European nightjars . Like other aerial birds , such as swifts and swallows , nightjars make a quick plunge into water to wash . They have a unique serrated comb @-@ like structure on the middle claw that is used to preen and perhaps remove parasites . 
 In cold or inclement weather , several nightjar species can slow their metabolism and go into torpor , notably the common <unk> , which will maintain that state for weeks . The European nightjar has been observed in captivity to be able to maintain a state of torpor for at least eight days without harm , but the relevance of this to wild birds is unknown . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Breeding is normally from late May to August , but may be significantly earlier in northwest Africa or western Pakistan . Returning males arrive about two weeks before the females and establish territories which they patrol with wings held in a V @-@ shape and tail fanned , chasing intruders while wing @-@ clapping and calling . Fights may take place in flight or on the ground . The male 's display flight involves a similar wing and tail position with frequent wing clapping as he follows the female in a rising spiral . If she lands , he continues to display with bobbing and fluttering until the female spreads her wings and tail for copulation . Mating occasionally takes place on a raised perch instead of the ground . In good habitat , there may be 20 pairs per square kilometre ( 50 per square mile ) . 
 The European nightjar is normally monogamous . There is no nest , and the eggs are laid on the ground among plants or tree roots , or beneath a bush or tree . The site may be bare ground , leaf litter or pine needles , and is used for a number of years . The clutch is usually one or two whitish eggs , rarely unmarked , but normally blotched with browns and greys . The eggs average 32 mm × 22 mm ( 1 @.@ 26 in × 0 @.@ 87 in ) and weigh 8 @.@ 4 g ( 0 @.@ 30 oz ) , of which 6 % is shell . 
 Several nightjar species are known to be more likely to lay in the two weeks before the full moon than the during the waning moon , possibly because insect food may be easier to catch as the moon waxes . A study specifically looking at the European nightjar showed that the phase of the moon is a factor for birds laying in June , but not for earlier breeders . This strategy means that a second brood in July would also have a favourable lunar aspect . 
 Eggs are laid 36 – 48 hours apart , and incubation , mainly by the female , starts with the first egg . The male may incubate for short periods , especially around dawn or dusk , but spends the day roosting , sometimes outside his territory or close to other males . If the female is disturbed while breeding , she runs or flutters along the ground feigning injury until she has drawn the intruder away . She may also move the eggs a short distance with her bill . Each egg hatches after about 17 – 21 days . The semi @-@ precocial downy chicks are mobile when hatched , but are brooded to keep them warm . They fledge in 16 – 17 days and become independent of the adults around 32 days after hatching . A second brood may be raised by early nesting pairs , in which case the female leaves the first brood a few days before they fledge ; the male then cares for the first brood and assists with the second . Both adults feed the young with balls of insects which are either regurgitated into the chick 's mouth or pecked by the chick from the adult 's open bill . 
 Broods that fail tend to do so during incubation . One English study showed that only 14 @.@ 5 % of eggs survived to hatching , but once that stage was reached the chances of fledging successfully were high . European nightjars breed when aged one year , and typically live for four years . The adult annual survival rate is 70 % , but that for juveniles is unknown . The maximum known age in the wild is just over 12 years . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The European nightjar feeds on a wide variety of flying insects , including moths , beetles , mantises , dragonflies , cockroaches and flies . It will pick <unk> off vegetation . It consumes grit to aid with digesting its prey , but any plant material and non @-@ flying invertebrates consumed are taken inadvertently while hunting other food items . Young chicks have been known to eat their own faeces . 
 Birds hunt over open habitats and woodland clearings and edges , and may be attracted to insects concentrating around artificial lights , near farm animals or over stagnant ponds . They usually feed at night , but occasionally venture out on overcast days . Nightjars pursue insects with a light twisting flight , or flycatch from a perch ; they may rarely take prey off the ground . They drink by dipping to the water surface as they fly . Breeding European nightjars travel on average 3 @.@ 1 km ( 3 @,@ 400 yd ) from their nests to feed . Migrating birds live off their fat reserves . 
 European nightjars hunt by sight , silhouetting their prey against the night sky . They tend to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights , but fly continuously on darker nights when prey is harder to see . Hunting frequency reduces in the middle of the night . Although they have very small bills , the mouth can be opened very wide as they catch insects . They have long sensitive bristles around the mouth , which may help to locate or funnel prey into the mouth . Indigestible parts of insects , such as the chitin exoskeleton , are regurgitated as pellets . 
 Nightjars have relatively large eyes , each with a tapetum lucidum ( reflective layer behind the retina ) that makes the eyes shine in torchlight and improves light detection at dusk , dawn and in moonlight . The retinas of nocturnal birds , including nightjars , are adapted for sight in low @-@ light levels and have a higher density of rod cells and far fewer cone cells compared to those of most diurnal birds . These adaptations favour good night vision at the expense of colour discrimination . In many day @-@ flying species , light passes through coloured oil droplets within the cone cells to improve colour vision . In contrast , nightjars have a limited number of cone cells , either lacking or having only a few oil droplets . The nocturnal eyesight of nightjars is probably equivalent to that of owls . Although they have good hearing , European nightjars appear not to rely on sound to find insects , and nightjars do not echolocate . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 The eggs and chicks of this ground @-@ nesting bird are vulnerable to predation by red foxes , pine martens , European hedgehogs , least weasels and domestic dogs , and by birds including crows , Eurasian magpies , Eurasian jays and owls . Snakes , such as common adders , may also rob the nest . Adults may be caught by birds of prey including northern goshawks , hen harriers , Eurasian sparrowhawks , common buzzards , peregrine and sooty falcons . 
 Parasites recorded on the European nightjar include a single species of biting louse found on the wings , and a feather mite that occurs only on the white wing markings . Avian malaria has also been recorded . The <unk> blood parasite L. <unk> is rare in the European nightjar . Its scarcity and the fact that it is the only one of its genus found in nightjars support the suggestion that it has crossed over from close relatives that normally infect owls . 
 = = Status = = 
 Estimates of the European population of the European nightjar range from 470 @,@ 000 to more than 1 million birds , suggesting a total global population of 2 – 6 million individuals . Although there appears to be a fall in numbers , it is not rapid enough to trigger the vulnerability criteria . The huge breeding range and population mean that this species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern . 
 The largest breeding populations are in Russia ( up to 500 @,@ 000 pairs ) , Spain ( 112 @,@ 000 pairs ) and Belarus ( 60 @,@ 000 pairs ) . There have been declines in much of the range , but especially in northwestern Europe . The loss of insect prey through pesticide use , coupled with disturbance , collision with vehicles and habitat loss have contributed to the falling population . As ground @-@ nesting birds , they are adversely affected by disturbance , especially by domestic dogs , which may destroy the nest or advertise its presence to crows or predatory mammals . Breeding success is higher in areas with no public access ; where access is permitted , and particularly where dog owners allow their pets to run loose , successful nests tend to be far from footpaths or human habitation . 
 In Britain and elsewhere , commercial forestry has created new habitat which has increased numbers , but these gains are likely to be temporary as the woodland develops and becomes unsuitable for nightjars . In the United Kingdom , it is red @-@ listed as a cause for concern , and in Ireland it is close to extinction . 
 = = In culture = = 
 Poets sometimes use the nightjar as an indicator of warm summer nights , as in George Meredith 's " Love in the Valley " Lone on the fir @-@ branch , his rattle @-@ notes unvaried / Brooding o 'er the gloom , spins the brown eve @-@ jar , Dylan Thomas 's " Fern Hill " and all the night long I heard , blessed among stables , the nightjars / flying with the <unk> , or Wordsworth 's " Calm is the fragrant air " , The busy dor @-@ hawk chases the white moth / With <unk> note . Nightjars only sing when perched , and Thomas Hardy referenced the eerie silence of a hunting bird in " Afterwards " : If it be in the dusk when , like an eyelid 's soundless blink / The <unk> @-@ hawk comes crossing the shades to alight / Upon the wind @-@ warped upland thorn . 
 Caprimulgus and the old name " goatsucker " both refer to the myth , old even in the time of Aristotle , that nightjars suckled from nanny goats , which subsequently ceased to give milk or went blind . This ancient belief is reflected in nightjar names in other European languages , such as German <unk> , Polish " <unk> " and Italian <unk> , which also mean goatsucker , but despite its antiquity , it has no equivalents in Arab , Chinese or Hindu traditions . It is likely that the birds were attracted by insects around domestic animals , and , as strange nocturnal creatures , were then blamed for any misfortune that befell the beast . Another old name , " <unk> " , was used to refer to both the bird and a disease of farm animals , the latter actually caused by botfly larvae under the skin . " Lich fowl " ( corpse bird ) is an old name which reflects the superstitions that surrounded this strange nocturnal bird . Like " <unk> ratchet " ( corpse hound ) , it may refer to the belief that the souls of unbaptised children were doomed to wander in nightjar form until Judgement Day .

 The 1920 Columbus Panhandles season was the franchise 's inaugural season in the American Professional Football Association ( APFA ) — later named the National Football League . The season concluded with the team going 2 – 7 – 2 and finishing 13th place in the APFA standings . The Panhandles entered the season after a 3 – 6 – 1 record in 1919 . The team opened the 1920 season with a loss to the Dayton Triangles , and the Panhandles lost five straight until a victory over the Zanesville Mark Greys . Not a single player was on the All @-@ Pro list . 
 = = Offseason = = 
 The Columbus Panhandles finished their 1919 season with a 3 – 6 – 1 record in the Ohio League . On August 20 , 1920 , a meeting was held at Ralph Hay 's automobile attended by representatives of four Ohio League teams : the Canton Bulldogs , the Cleveland Tigers , the Dayton Triangles , and the Akron Pros . At the meeting , they tentatively agreed to introduce a salary cap for the teams , not to sign college players nor players under contract with another team , and became united as the American Professional Football Conference . They then contacted other major professional teams and invited them to a meeting for September 17 . 
 At the meeting in September , representatives of the Rock Island Independents , the Muncie Flyers , the Decatur Staleys , the Racine Cardinals , the Massillon Tigers , the Chicago Cardinals , the Rochester Jeffersons , and the Hammond Pros . The following was achieved during the September 17 meeting : the name of American Professional Football Association was chosen ; officers of the league were elected with Jim Thorpe as president ; a membership fee of $ 100 was set ; a committee to draft a constitution was named ; the secretary of the league was to receive a list of all players used during the season by January 1 , 1921 ; and the trophy that would be awarded to the league champions . Even though the Panhandles were not at the meetings , they were still a charter member of the APFA . 
 = = Regular season = = 
 The Panhandles played their only home game at Neil Park . Joseph Carr made the team play mostly away games because they were able to travel on the railroads for free . This cut down on stadium cost and saved the team money . The regular season schedule was not a fixed schedule but was created dynamically by each team as the season progressed . Over the course of the 1920 season , the Panhandles played a total of 11 games . Of those 11 games , five were against APFA teams , and the others were against non @-@ APFA teams . Every game played against league teams resulted in a loss . 
 The records kept for the 1920 season included games played against APFA and non @-@ APFA teams . The Panhandles opened the season with a 14 – 0 loss to the Dayton Triangles in the first football game with two APFA teams . The previous week , considered week one , the Rock Island Independents played against the St. Paul Ideals in the first APFA game . The Panhandles lost their next five games without scoring a point , until a 10 – 0 win over the Zanesville Mark Greys . The Panhandles ended the season with a 24 – 0 victory and finished with a 2 – 7 – 2 record .

 The Panhandles ' opening game against the Dayton Triangles is considered to be the first football game between two APFA teams . The Panhandles lost 14 – 0 to the Triangles . Despite the first two quarters resulting in ties , the crowd was excited . In the second quarter , the Triangles made a goal line stand while the Panhandles had the ball on the 3 @-@ yard line . Before halftime , the Triangles ' Al Mahrt completed a 30 @-@ yard pass to Dutch Thiele , which resulted in the Triangles to having the ball on the 5 @-@ yard line . The Triangles ' did not score on that possession due to the clock running out . 
 Early in the third quarter , the Triangles started a possession on their own 35 @-@ yard line . Four consecutive run plays carried them to midfield . Then , Lou Partlow had a long run to the 10 @-@ yard line . The possession ended with a rushing touchdown from Partlow . The other Triangle score came in the middle of the fourth quarter . Frank Bacon returned a punt return for a 60 @-@ yard touchdown . After both touchdowns , George <unk> was responsible for the extra points .

This was the eighth straight loss for the Panhandles , dating back to 1919 , and the seventh straight without scoring . According to football historian Chris Willis , this loss for the Panhandles crushed the city of Columbus and made the Panhandles challenge lesser teams for the rest of the season .

 Route 38 is a state highway in the southern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey serving the Philadelphia metropolitan area . It extends 19 @.@ 19 mi ( 30 @.@ 88 km ) from the Airport Circle , where it intersects U.S. Route 30 and U.S. Route 130 , in Pennsauken Township , Camden County to an intersection with U.S. Route 206 and County Route 530 in Southampton Township , Burlington County . The route is a four- to six @-@ lane divided highway for most of its length and passes through commercial development , residential development , and some farmland . 
 Route 38 was signed in 1927 , replacing part of Pre @-@ 1927 Route 18 , which had run from Camden to Toms River . Route 38 was originally planned to be a freeway crossing the state of New Jersey , running from Camden to Wall Township , Monmouth County . The eastern part of this freeway would become part of Interstate 195 in the late 1960s . The freeway routing was then modified to head north of Interstate 195 to the Route 18 freeway in Colts Neck Township but was ultimately canceled by the late 1970s due to environmental and financial concerns . Route 138 was originally numbered as a segment of this Route 38 freeway , but was renumbered by the 1990s when it became apparent the freeway would not be completed . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Route 38 begins at the Airport Circle junction of County Route 607 ( <unk> Avenue ) , U.S. Route 30 , and U.S. Route 130 in Pennsauken Township , Camden County , heading east on <unk> Avenue . It meets a partial cloverleaf interchange with the western terminus of Route 70 , which replaced the Browning Road Traffic Circle . A six – lane divided highway separated by a Jersey barrier , it proceeds eastward , crossing into Cherry Hill Township , where it heads through commercial development . Route 38 features cloverleaf interchanges with County Route 636 ( Cuthbert Boulevard ) and County Route 644 ( Haddonfield Road ) . Past the County Route 644 interchange , Route 38 passes by the Cherry Hill Mall , located on the north side of the road . It proceeds through the Church Road Circle , where it crosses County Route 616 ( Church Road ) and County Route 627 ( Coles Avenue / Cooper Landing Road ) . 
 Route 38 crosses the South Branch of the Pennsauken Creek into Maple Shade Township , Burlington County . The route then reaches a cloverleaf interchange with Route 41 and then interchanges with Route 73 . The Route 38 @-@ 41 @-@ 73 interchange complex replaced a dangerous and congested 6 @-@ way traffic circle . The route then crosses County Route 608 ( <unk> Road ) into Moorestown Township , where it becomes unnamed . Route 38 then travels by the Moorestown Mall before passing by the Strawbridge Lake Park . It then enters Mount Laurel Township , where it intersects Interstate 295 before passing over the New Jersey Turnpike . 
 It then continues east , heading into more residential than commercial development . Route 38 intersects many roads with jughandles , crossing into <unk> Township . The route then crosses the South Branch of Rancocas Creek before entering Lumberton Township , where the road intersects County Route 541 , the Mount Holly Bypass . Route 38 then runs through the southern part of the Mount Holly area , intersecting County Route 691 , the former alignment of County Route 541 . It crosses into Mount Holly Township at the intersection of County Route 612 ( Pine Street / <unk> Road ) . Past this intersection , Route 38 eventually becomes an undivided highway and then reenters Lumberton Township . The route then heads into farmland and crosses into Southampton Township at the intersection with County Route 684 ( Smithville Road ) . Route 38 then ends at the intersection with U.S. Route 206 where the road continues east as County Route 530 ( Pemberton Road ) . 
 = = History = = 
 Prior to 1927 , the route was a part of Pre @-@ 1927 Route 18 , which was legislated in 1923 to run from Camden to Toms River . In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 38 was legislated to run along the route from Route 25 ( now U.S. Route 130 ) in Pennsauken Township east to Route 39 ( now U.S. Route 206 ) in East Hampton . 
 In 1938 , Route 38 was legislated to extend from East Hampton to Route 4N ( now Route 71 ) in Wall Township , Monmouth County . A section of this was built , running between Route 34 and Route 35 in Wall Township . The Route 38 freeway was then planned in 1961 to connect these two sections of Route 38 . It was to run from Interstate 80S ( now Interstate 676 ) in Camden east to the planned Route 35 freeway ( now Route 18 ) in Wall Township , providing a direct freeway connection between the Philadelphia area and the northern Jersey Shore . The route of the freeway was to run east from the Ben Franklin Bridge , paralleling U.S. Route 30 and then Route 70 . It would then have run parallel to the current alignment of Route 38 through the Mount Holly area and then travel along the northern border of the Fort Dix Military Reservation to Jackson Township , Ocean County , where it would then follow the present alignment of Interstate 195 to Wall Township . In the late 1960s , the eastern part of the Route 38 freeway became part of the proposed Interstate 195 . 
 In 1969 , it was estimated the Route 38 freeway between Interstate 295 in Cherry Hill Township and Interstate 195 in Jackson Township would cost $ 60 million and be completed by 1985 . The route of the freeway was revised in 1972 to head north of Interstate 195 to the Route 18 freeway in Colts Neck Township , intersecting the Route 33 bypass of Freehold Borough . The western terminus was also moved to Mount Laurel Township , where it was to connect to the New Jersey Turnpike and the Route 90 freeway , which was projected to extend to the New Jersey Turnpike . It was estimated that this routing of the Route 38 freeway would cost $ 101 million . However , due to environmental concerns of the route passing through the Pine Barrens and financial troubles , the freeway was canceled by the end of the 1970s . The orphaned eastern section of Route 38 in Monmouth County was renumbered to Route 138 on July 29 , 1988 .

 Tracy Anne Stockwell , OAM , ( born January 11 , 1963 ) , née Tracy Anne Caulkins , is an American former competition swimmer , three @-@ time Olympic gold medalist , five @-@ time world champion , and former world record @-@ holder in three events . 
 Caulkins was noted for her versatility and ability in all four major competitive swimming strokes : the butterfly , breaststroke , backstroke and freestyle . Caulkins won forty @-@ eight national championships and set American records in all four strokes over a range of distances as well as in the individual medley ( IM ) events , which combine all four strokes over the course of a single race . Her versatility brought Caulkins many titles and awards , and as a result she is considered one of the greatest swimmers of all time . By the time she retired from competitive swimming in 1984 , Caulkins had set five world records and sixty @-@ three American records ( more than any other American swimmer , male or female ) . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Caulkins was born in Winona , Minnesota in 1963 . She swam for the Westside Victory Swim club and later the Nashville Aquatic Club ( NAC ) in Nashville , Tennessee , where she was trained by future University of Texas and U.S. Olympic coach Paul Bergen . For her high school education , she attended the all @-@ girls <unk> Hall School in Nashville . Caulkins ' older sister Amy was also a competition swimmer and water polo player . 
 = = Olympic desire = = 
 As a 9 @-@ year @-@ old , Caulkins had been training as a swimmer for a little over a year when she watched the 1972 Munich Olympics on television , and decided that she wanted to swim in the Olympics and win a gold medal . In a 1997 interview , Caulkins credited her Olympic dream as her inspiration and motivation . 
 Thirteen @-@ year @-@ old Caulkins competed in her first U.S. national swimming championships in 1976 . A year later , she returned to the 1977 U.S. Short @-@ Course Championships to set U.S. records in the 200 @-@ yard and 400 @-@ yard individual medley events . She set a third U.S. record while finishing second behind Canadian swimmer Robin <unk> in the 100 @-@ yard breaststroke . 
 At the age of 15 , Caulkins won five gold medals and a silver medal at the 1978 World Championships in West Berlin . She won the 200 @-@ meter individual medley , the 400 @-@ meter individual medley , and the 200 @-@ meter butterfly , and was a member of the winning U.S. teams in the 4 × 100 @-@ meter medley relay , and the 4 × 100 @-@ meter freestyle relay . In the process , she set four world records and one American record . Largely as a result of her performance in Berlin , Caulkins won the 1978 James E. Sullivan Award , given by the Amateur Athletic Union in recognition of the most outstanding American amateur athlete of the year . At 15 years old , she was the youngest @-@ ever recipient of the Sullivan Award . 
 She followed her World Championship success with a series of dominating finishes in U.S. competition . At the 1979 U.S. Short @-@ Course Championships in East Los Angeles , California , she set five U.S. records in the 100 @-@ yard breaststroke , 500 @-@ yard freestyle , the 400 @-@ yard individual medley , the 200 @-@ yard individual medley , and the 100 @-@ yard freestyle on the first leg of the 400 @-@ yard relay . She also helped her club team , Nashville Aquatic , win the 400 @-@ yard medley relay and place second in the 800 @-@ yard freestyle relay . Despite setting the new records , however , she was not at her physical best ; she was suffering from the after @-@ effects of a viral infection . Three months later , she won four gold medals and two silvers at the 1979 Pan American Games in San Juan , Puerto Rico . 
 Following her gold @-@ medal performance at the 1978 World Championship , Caulkins was expected to win multiple medals at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow , Russia , and qualified to compete in five individual events at the U.S. Olympic Trials , and likely would have been selected as a member of one of the relay teams as well . However , the U.S. Olympic team boycotted the 1980 Games at the behest of U.S. President Jimmy Carter , following the Soviet Union 's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan . Caulkins ' dream of Olympic gold was deferred by war and politics , so she quietly looked ahead to 1984 . 
 As an 18 @-@ year @-@ old high school senior , she set four American short @-@ course records at the 1981 U.S. Short @-@ Course Championships in Cambridge , Massachusetts . In each of the four events , she bettered her own previously @-@ set American record : the 100 @-@ yard breaststroke , 200 @-@ yard backstroke , the 200 @-@ yard individual medley , and the 400 @-@ yard individual medley . 
 Over the next three years , Caulkins maintained her training regimen while attending the University of Florida in Gainesville , Florida , where she swam for coach Randy Reese 's Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) competition from 1982 to 1984 . Caulkins followed her older sister Amy to the University of Florida , where Amy was already an established member of the Florida Gators swim team . With Caulkins leading the way as a freshman , the Gators won the NCAA team championship in 1982 ; the Gators finished second in 1983 and third in 1984 . Individually , in three years as a Gator swimmer , she won sixteen NCAA championships and twelve Southeastern Conference ( SEC ) individual titles , and received twenty @-@ one All @-@ American honors . She was the SEC 's Female Swimmer of the Year in 1983 and 1984 , and was recognized as the SEC 's Female Athlete of the Year in 1984 . She was the recipient of the Honda Sports Award for Swimming and Diving for three consecutive years , recognizing her as the outstanding college female swimmer of the year . 
 At the 1982 U.S. Short @-@ Course Championships in Gainesville , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old again won national championships in the 200 @-@ yard backstroke , 400 @-@ yard individual medley , the 200 @-@ yard individual medley , and the 100 @-@ yard breaststroke . With thirty @-@ nine national championships to date , Caulkins surpassed the legendary Johnny Weissmuller 's record total of thirty @-@ six . 
 Even as she continued to win against fellow Americans in 1982 and 1983 , however , she was slumping and falling behind her international competition . She set no new international records , and was increasingly frustrated with her own performances . At the 1982 World Championships in Guayaquil , Ecuador , she finished a distant third in both the 200 @-@ meter and 400 @-@ meter individual medley events against her East German competition , and failed to place in the third event in which she was entered . At the 1983 U.S. Long @-@ Course Championships in Fresno , California , she finished five seconds slower than her own American record in the 400 @-@ meter individual medley and finished second behind Mary T. Meagher in the 200 @-@ meter butterfly . At the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas , Venezuela , held later the same month , she likewise won her two signature events in the 200 @-@ meter and 400 @-@ meter individual medley , but did not approach her own personal bests . 
 Afterward , Caulkins rededicated herself to coach Randy Reese 's rigorous training methods . In an international invitational meet of 26 nations held in Austin , Texas in January 1984 , she defeated her East German rivals in both individual medley events . At the NCAA national championships later that spring , she won four individual titles in the 200- and 400 @-@ yard individual medleys , 100 @-@ yard breaststroke , and 200 @-@ yard butterfly , and was a member of the Gators ' winning relay teams in the 4 × 100 @-@ yard and 4 × 200 @-@ yard freestyle events . She set new NCAA records in three events , and a new American record in the 200 @-@ yard individual medley . 
 At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles , California , Caulkins served as the captain of the U.S. women 's swim team , and finally realized her childhood dream of winning an Olympic gold medal . On July 29 , she won her first gold medal in the 400 @-@ meter individual medley , beating Australian Suzie Landells by over nine seconds . On August 3 , she won her second gold medal in the 200 @-@ meter individual medley with an Olympic record time of 2 : 12 @.@ 64 , besting fellow American Nancy Hogshead by over two and a half seconds . And later that same day , she won her third gold medal by swimming the breaststroke leg as a member of the winning U.S. team in the 400 @-@ meter medley relay , together with teammates Theresa Andrews ( backstroke ) , Mary T. Meagher ( butterfly ) , and Nancy Hogshead ( freestyle ) . She also finished fourth in the 100 @-@ meter breaststroke , one second behind winner Petra van <unk> . 
 Caulkins ended her competition swimming career having set five world records and sixty @-@ three American records , and having won forty @-@ eight national championship titles .

" Caulkins was inducted into the Florida Sports Hall of Fame in 1983 , the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1990 , and the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in 1996 .

 = = Plot = = 
 Robert California ( James Spader ) confronts Andy ( Ed Helms ) about the number of mishaps and blunders made in the office , and gives him a firm directive to bring them to a stop . With no ideas on how to make this come about , Andy puts it in the hands of Dwight ( Rainn Wilson ) , who devises a system to find mistakes made by employees in the office . He programs an " efficiency motivator " that will forward incriminating emails to California if they make five mistakes in one day , effectively causing them to lose their jobs . However , the group manages to make five mistakes barely halfway through the first day with the system , and Dwight reveals that the emails will be automatically sent to California at 5 : 00 pm . Andy pleads with Dwight to deactivate the system , but Dwight refuses , belittles the rest of the office staff for being so careless , and retreats to Schrute Farms . 
 The office formulates two plans to save their jobs . Jim ( John Krasinski ) is tasked with tracking down Robert at a squash court and intercepting the emails before California has a chance to view them , while Andy , Pam ( Jenna Fischer ) , Erin , and Kevin ( Brian Baumgartner ) head to Schrute Farms , ostensibly to try and change Dwight 's mind . However , Pam consistently silences any attempt to bring up the device , saying she knows Dwight and is confident that he will stop the device on his own . After complimenting Dwight numerous times and having a small meal , Pam makes a joke that emphasizes that everyone is human and makes mistakes . 
 To justify his presence at the squash court , Jim claims to be a regular player and begins a match with Robert , demonstrating his complete lack of skill at squash and resulting in multiple injuries . He makes an unsuccessful attempt to access Robert 's email from his phone , and finally resorts to trying to " accidentally " break his phone . However , when Robert checks his messages after 5 : 00 , the e @-@ mail has not come through . Realizing that Dwight must have stopped the device , Jim admits that he was obviously lying about being a squash player and prepares to leave , but Robert , apparently oblivious to Jim 's statements , makes him stay and continue playing . 
 Back in the warehouse , Gabe ( Zach Woods ) unsuccessfully tries to strike up a relationship with a new warehouse worker , Val ( Ameenah Kaplan ) . Darryl ( Craig Robinson ) , observing Gabe 's pitiful attempts , tries to imply that Val doesn 't feel the same way , but to no avail . When Gabe does ask Val out , she politely declines and says she does not date co @-@ workers . Darryl hears all of this and decides he won 't pursue Val either .

 Literary Hall is a mid @-@ 19th @-@ century brick library building and museum in Romney , West Virginia . It is located at the intersection of North High Street ( West Virginia Route 28 ) and West Main Street ( U.S. Route 50 ) . Literary Hall was constructed between 1869 and 1870 by the Romney Literary Society . 
 Founded in 1819 , the Romney Literary Society was the first literary organization of its kind in the present @-@ day state of West Virginia , and one of the first in the United States . In 1846 , the society constructed a building which housed the Romney Classical Institute and its library . The Romney Literary Society and the Romney Classical Institute both flourished and continued to grow in importance and influence until the onset of the American Civil War in 1861 . During the war , the contents of the society 's library were plundered by Union Army forces , and many of its 3 @,@ 000 volumes were either scattered or destroyed . After a reorganization in 1869 , the society commenced construction of the present Literary Hall in downtown Romney . It transferred ownership of its Romney Classical Institute campus to the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind in 1870 and in that year completed Literary Hall , where the society reconstituted its library collection and revived its literary activities . 
 The Romney Literary Society 's last meeting was held at Literary Hall in 1886 . From 1886 to 1973 the building was used as a meeting space by the Clinton Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons and the Order of the Eastern Star . In 1973 , the building was purchased by prominent Romney lawyer Ralph Haines , who used it as a law office and museum . From 1937 to the early 1940s the building also housed a community library . Literary Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29 , 1979 . 
 Literary Hall 's basic design incorporates Federal and Greek Revival styles along with Victorian details . Architectural historian Michael J. Pauley described Literary Hall as " one of Romney 's and Hampshire County 's most notable landmarks , and one in which this community is justifiably proud " .

 Literary Hall was built upon a land lot designated " Lot 56 " to the immediate west of the public square of Romney . In 1790 , the trustees of the Town of Romney commissioned John Mitchel to draft a cadastral survey map of Romney . Prior to this survey , Lord Fairfax had commissioned a similar cadastral survey of Romney sometime before the town 's incorporation on December 23 , 1762 . On June 30 , 1790 , Mitchel submitted to the trustees a " Plan of the Town of Romney " , which divided the town into 100 land lots of equal size , with four lots adjacent to the courthouse comprising the public square . 
 = = = Romney Literary Society = = = 
 The Romney Literary Society , which built Literary Hall between 1869 and 1870 , was organized by nine prominent men in Romney on January 30 , 1819 . With its establishment in 1819 , the Romney Literary Society became the first literary organization of its kind in the present @-@ day state of West Virginia , and one of the first in the United States . On February 4 , 1819 , the constitution of the society was adopted , which provided that the organization should be known as the " Polemic Society of Romney " . The society founded its library in 1819 with the acquisition of two books , and by 1861 the society 's humble library had grown to contain approximately 3 @,@ 000 volumes , consisting of books on literature , science , history and art . 
 The Romney Literary Society commenced a movement to establish an institution for " the higher education of the youth of the community " . As a result of this initiative , the teaching of the classics was introduced into the curriculum of Romney Academy in 1820 , thus making the institution the first school of higher education in the Eastern Panhandle . In 1846 , the society constructed a new building to house the Romney Classical Institute and its library , both of which fell under the society 's supervision . 
 The Romney Literary Society and the Romney Classical Institute both flourished and continued to grow in importance and influence until the onset of the American Civil War in 1861 . During the war , many members fought for the Confederate States Army forces and were killed during the conflict . The contents of the society 's library were plundered by Union Army forces and many of its 3 @,@ 000 volumes were either scattered or destroyed . Following the war 's end , only 400 of those volumes could be recovered , with just 200 remaining on the library 's shelves . 
 The Romney Literary Society reorganized on May 15 , 1869 . Following the reorganization , the society built Literary Hall between 1869 and 1870 while also undertaking an initiative to bring the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind to its old Romney Classical Institute campus . The construction of Literary Hall was part of the society 's effort to revive the organization and reassemble its original library . The society set about recovering original volumes and purchasing new ones , and the library reopened with 700 volumes . For a period of ten years between 1870 and 1880 , much of Romney 's intellectual life centered on Literary Hall . As older members died , interest in the society began to dwindle . The society 's meetings were held less frequently , and its last recorded meeting was held on February 15 , 1886 . 
 = = = Clinton Lodge = = = 
 The Clinton Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons was the second organization to utilize Literary Hall as a meeting place . The Clinton Lodge was the first Masonic lodge to be chartered in Hampshire County and is among the earliest Masonic lodges to be established in present @-@ day West Virginia . It was chartered by the Grand Lodge of Virginia on December 13 , 1825 . The lodge underwent four periods of hiatus : first , between 1838 and December 15 , 1846 ; a second time between 1855 and its rechartering on July 3 , 1857 ; a third time between 1861 and December 11 , 1867 , during the American Civil War and Reconstruction ; and a fourth time between November 29 , 1881 , and November 12 , 1890 , when it was again reactivated . 
 Following the completion of Literary Hall in 1870 , the Clinton Lodge Masons regularly utilized the first floor of the building as a meeting space , while the Romney Literary Society maintained its use of the second floor as a library . Between its various periods of dormancy , the Clinton Lodge and the associated Order of the Eastern Star , which was organized in July 1919 , utilized Literary Hall as a meeting space , and following the Romney Literary Society 's disestablishment , the Masons and Eastern Star continued their use of the building . In 1973 , prominent Romney lawyer Ralph Haines purchased Literary Hall from the Clinton Lodge Masons and provided the lodge with a land lot for the construction of a new Masonic Temple at the corner of Washington and Center Streets in Romney . Following his purchase of Literary Hall , Haines used the historic building as a law office building and private museum . Literary Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29 , 1979 . 
 = = = Hampshire County Public Library = = = 
 The building again served as a library in March 1937 , when Romney 's community library was relocated to the first floor of Literary Hall from its previous facility in the basement of the Hampshire County Courthouse . The library had been established on April 11 , 1935 , as a project by the American Legion Auxiliary and was housed in a room of the courthouse basement where it was staffed by volunteers and open from 14 : 00 to 16 : 00 on Saturday afternoons . When the library 's collection of both purchased and donated books outgrew its space in the courthouse basement , the Clinton Lodge Masons granted permission to the library to house its collection at Literary Hall in 1937 . Following its move to Literary Hall , the library expanded its hours , and expanded them again , to five afternoons a week , through the assistance of the National Youth Administration and the Works Progress Administration . 
 In January 1942 , a meeting was held for the purpose of establishing a more extensive library service . Later that month , on January 29 , a charter was issued by West Virginia Secretary of State William Smith O 'Brien for the creation of the non @-@ profit Hampshire County Library Association . Following its incorporation , the library was relocated from Literary Hall to two rear adjoining rooms on the second story of the Hampshire County Courthouse . The association continued to house its library collection in the courthouse until 1967 , when the new Hampshire County Public Library building at 153 West Main Street was formally dedicated on September 28 , 1967 . The library had been built on land donated by sisters Kate and Mary Davis , who had been engaged in the restoration of Literary Hall and whose father , Charles Maurice Davis , had been a member of both the Romney Literary Society and the Clinton Lodge Masons , which had both held meetings in the building . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The interior and exterior of Literary Hall remain largely intact . At two stories , the building is tall in its proportion and incorporates elements from both early American and Victorian styles , which were common in academic buildings built during this period . 
 Architectural historian S. Allen Chambers described Literary Hall as an anomaly because the basic design and fenestration patterns , which invoke early Federal and Greek Revival design elements , are adorned with details more characteristic of the Victorian era . 
 According to architectural historian Michael J. Pauley of the West Virginia Department of Culture and History 's Historic Preservation Unit , Literary Hall 's unique structural features make the building " one of Romney 's and Hampshire County 's most notable landmarks , and one in which this community is justifiably proud " . Pauley further averred that the building is " highly representative of the development of education and literature in the early United States " . In describing its impact on Romney 's streetscape , Chambers described Literary Hall as " adding distinction to Romney 's major street intersection " . Chambers also noted the building 's resemblance and " strong architectural kinship " to the Romney Presbyterian Church . 
 Literary Hall is a two @-@ story red brick structure , rectangular in plan , and topped with a gable roof . The first floor of Literary Hall consists of four rooms , and the second story is a single large ballroom . Fused with symmetrical elements evoking Federal and Greek Revival architectural styles are exterior decorative moldings and brick <unk> in the Victorian style . 
 The main façade ( south elevation ) of Literary Hall is divided into three bays , and its west and east elevations are divided into five bays . Each of the building 's bays consists of a double @-@ hung sash wooden window , with nine panes of glass within each sash . The windows are symmetrically placed within recessed brick panels that are defined at the first and second stories of the building with elementary brick ribs , or pseudo @-@ pilasters , that form the outer surface of the building 's exterior walls and provide separation of the three bays of the main façade and the five bays of the west and east elevations . The windows are framed by white wooden louvered window shutters . The building 's brick is laid in an American bond pattern , with five courses of stretchers between every course of headers . 
 The main façade is topped by a simple wooden raking cornice that surmounts an ornamental corbel brick pendant . A semicircular fanlight , or lunette , is located in the center of the gable of the building 's main façade , providing lighting to the building 's attic . Chambers described this window as the most antiquated of the building 's architectural elements and may have been based on the fanlight of the county 's earlier courthouse built in 1833 , which was located to the building 's east . 
 Each of the main façade 's first- and second @-@ story windows and the entrance are adorned with white wooden label moldings . The main entrance is composed of a tall double wooden entrance door , with its original handle and locks . Each door consists of four vertical wooden panels . A rectangular transom light of four vertical glass panels tops the main entryway 's double wooden doors . Outside the entryway is a spacious brick stoop that is accessed by a cement walkway from West Main Street . Its brick steps leading up to the stoop were last restored in the late 1970s . 
 Literary Hall is flanked by two interior side chimneys , between the second and third bays of the west and east elevations of the building . The building rests on a sandstone , ashlar block foundation . Its gable roof is sheathed with standing seam tin sheeting . 
 = Lights and Sounds = 
 Lights and Sounds is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Yellowcard , released on January 24 , 2006 , in the United States through Capitol Records . Lights and Sounds is Yellowcard 's first concept album , which was inspired to reflect what the band was feeling at the time of production and how they have matured in the process . Lights and Sounds also departs from the sounds on Yellowcard 's previous album , Ocean Avenue ( 2003 ) , which broke away from its pop punk sound to a more alternative rock album . 
 Lights and Sounds debuted to mixed reviews from contemporary music critics , receiving criticism as the album fell short from the standard set by its predecessor , Ocean Avenue . Upon the album 's release , it charted at number five on Billboard 's 200 and Top Internet Albums ' charts , making it the band highest charting album to date . The album accumulated sales of just over 315 @,@ 000 copies , which failed to match the 2 million sales of their previous album . Yellowcard went on to explain that the disappointment of the sales were due to their going " a bit too far " with the expectations they had thought the album would exceed . Lights and Sounds was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . 
 The album yielded two singles , " Lights and Sounds " and " Rough Landing , Holly " . While the band was promoting the album , lead guitarist Ben Harper parted ways with the band . Following Harper 's departure , the band revealed that they had entered their " highest and lowest " points because of Harper 's departure from the band . To accommodate the album 's promotion , Yellowcard replaced Harper with guitarist Ryan Mendez .

 After almost two years of touring in support of their 2003 album , Ocean Avenue , Yellowcard took a few months off . In December 2004 , vocalist Ryan Key and bassist Peter Mosely moved to New York City to write songs for their upcoming album , while the rest of the band remained in Los Angeles . 
 As Key and Mosely stayed in New York , they admitted that there was a delay when it came to start writing songs for the album . Key , however , did explain that they were writing " weird , obscure , not @-@ too @-@ mellow " tracks and working on notebooks that he compiled while the band was touring . He also noted that he was able to write for a couple of hours and would receive over " 15 @-@ 20 ideas " that he could take out for the band , so once they all got together , they can start collaborating on the record . Mosely , also in discussion of this , added that the reason it took them so long was because they were " scared to death " with the writing . Mosely concluded that once the writing had begun , the process was easier on them . It was also during this time that Key and Mosely began to turn their apartment into a studio , adding a drum kit , guitar amps , and even including a piano . While Key and Mosely began the development of the songs , the rest of the members would occasionally fly to New York to check on the progress . 
 In April 2005 , the band met in Los Angeles and began recording at the Sunset Sound studios . The following month in an interview with MTV News , lead guitarist Ben Harper revealed that the writing process was finished . In addition , Harper commented that the band recorded 19 songs for the album , 13 of which made the final cut . In August 2005 , Yellowcard announced the songs , " Lights and Sounds " , " Sure Thing Falling " , and " Two Weeks from Twenty " , that were going to be featured in the album . It was also revealed that the album would feature an instrumental and hidden track . In September 2005 , the band announced a release for Lights and Sounds in January 2006 .

 With Lights and Sounds , Yellowcard broke away from their original pop punk sound to a more alternative rock album . The album is somewhat of a concept album , made to reflect what Yellowcard was feeling at the time of production . Ryan Key , in discussion of this , said that Ocean Avenue was about " finding your place in the world " and explained that Lights and Sounds was about " realizing that you 've gotten lost " . The band has cited Radiohead 's Kid A ( 2000 ) and Guns N ' Roses ' 1991 albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II as major influences for the album . Yellowcard also credit Aphex Twin , Mouse on Mars and Explosions in the Sky for inspiration , regarding the music sound in the album . 
 In an interview in August 2005 , Key explained that the album was a " definite departure " and " more political " than what Ocean Avenue had contained . In discussion of the album , Key said that the band had matured and that the music in Lights and Sounds would be different from their previous album . Though , Key added , " ... we have to be careful , we have to try and write songs [ in the style of the ones ] we wrote before . We have to make a conscious effort not to think about the fact that we went from being a nothing band ... to having a bunch of hit singles in like , one year . " Printz Board of The Black Eyed Peas collaborated with Yellowcard on the song " Two Weeks from Twenty " where he played a trumpet solo . The song , " How I Go " , features a duet with Dixie Chicks ' lead vocalist Natalie Maines , and features a twenty @-@ five piece orchestra , which was conducted by violinist Sean Mackin . According to Peter Mosely , the band liked the Dixie Chicks ' and even thought of collaborating with Maines on Ocean Avenue for the song " View from Heaven " . Mosely also revealed that the band approached Maines about singing on " How I Go " ; " The original plan was just for her to sing back @-@ up ( on the song ) . [ But ] it ended up turning into a duet . " He also added that Maines took a demo of the song and returned to the studio , Sunset Sound , where the band were working , in addition to the Dixie Chicks working on their album , with lyrics and vocals of her own . 
 Mackin also composed an entire string section and conducted an orchestra in the album . In an interview with Daily Nexus in June 2006 , Mackin revealed that the conducting was the easy part and that the composing part was much harder . In this interview , Mackin also commented , " composing was getting so frustrating since I wasn ’ t writing as fast as my mind was thinking , so going back I wanted to make sure that each of my arrangements for this album and the 12 different songs were completely different " .

 Lights and Sounds primarily focuses on the band coping with the success they were enduring when writing songs for the album . The album also goes with what Key described as when he was preoccupied with making Lights and Sounds . Key said that one of the common themes that were written in the album was the band 's hatred in living in Los Angeles . Key said that the songs have " lost that adolescent bounciness -- they 've come into adulthood a bit " . In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine , Key revealed that during the time he and Mosely spent in New York , he said it " brought out some darker places " in them and that it was " not in a ' now I 'm going to start wearing eyeliner ' kind of way , but emotionally darker . " In addition , many of the song 's themes deal with Key 's battle with drugs and alcohol . 
 While making the album , Yellowcard had also developed a character , Holly Wood , who served as a narrator and protagonist for the album 's storyline . The character is featured in the songs " Rough Landing , Holly " and " Holly Wood Died " . The band explained the meaning of the title track , which they said is based on a " whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members " and how they have changed as they have aged after the release of Ocean Avenue . Key also commented that when he was preoccupied with making the album , there were distractions while in the process ; he simply referred to the distractions as " lights and sounds " , which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album just that . He also says that the main reason behind that was how it affected the band during that particular time . 
 During discussion of the track listing in Lights and Sounds , Yellowcard revealed that " Two Weeks from Twenty " stretched the " limits " for them and explained that it was a " jazz @-@ lounge anti @-@ war song " . The band also explained that the song is a narrative of a young soldier named Jimmy , from New Jersey , who is killed in the Iraq war . Other songs such as " Down on My Head " , " City of Devils " , and " Holly Wood Died " , had a theme that spoke about bitterness and disillusionment . " How I Go " is based on both lament of a father over the life that has flowed past him and the 2003 film , Big Fish . Another song , " Words , Hands , Hearts " , is written about the events that occurred during the September 11 attacks . 
 = = Release and promotion = = 
 In September 2005 , the band announced the album 's title and revealed that the title track , " Lights and Sounds " , was confirmed to be the first single from the album , with a video shot in Van Nuys , California and a release date of November 15 , 2005 . Lights and Sounds was released worldwide on January 24 , 2006 , issued by the band 's record label , Capitol Records . 
 On October 24 , 2005 the band began a tour in support of the album , during which they began playing at small venues at college arenas . The tour lasted for six weeks . The album 's title track was included in the video game Burnout Revenge , as well as its spinoff Burnout Legends . The music video of " Lights and Sounds " was featured on a Verizon Wireless <unk> commercial around the time of the album 's release . The song " City of Devils " was featured in the episode , " I Love You But I 've Chosen Darkness " , on the CW 's One Tree Hill in October 2006 . The song , " Rough Landing , Holly " , was featured in the 2006 video game FlatOut 2 . 
 In November 2005 , it was announced that guitarist Ben Harper had parted ways with the band . Key explained that the band went through " a lot of the highest and lowest points " and that making an album " would be on the highest list , and losing a member would be on the lowest . " He also added , " It 's really been a long journey together , you know , so obviously , parting ways with Ben was a really unpleasant experience . It was either go on without him , or don 't go on at all . And , at the core , we decided that we had something too great to let go of , and that we had to kind of make a last resort and move on without him . " Harper was replaced by Ryan Mendez .

 The reviews for Lights and Sounds were mostly mixed upon release , particularly from mainstream media , but some critics have stated that the album had fallen well short of the standards of Ocean Avenue , the album 's predecessor . Kelefa Sanneh of the New York Times , in review of the album , wrote : " To listeners on either side of rock 's latest generational divide , there 's a big difference -- the difference of a decade -- between being a loser and being a twerp ... Lights and Sounds is Yellowcard 's attempt to split that difference . " Sanneh reports that the song " Two Weeks from Twenty " , one of the band 's anti @-@ war song , " sounds suspiciously like Green Day ; the lyrics echo the plot of the video for Green Day 's ' Wake Me Up When September Ends ' . " Despite this , Sanneh goes on to say that Yellowcard is still " pretty good " at " writing sweeping , upbeat punk @-@ rock love songs " . Ben <unk> of Kent News wrote : " One thing is certain : The Yellowcard you grew to know and love circa Ocean Avenue is no longer with us . The band has vastly matured when compared to past records , but it comes at a price – members forgot what made them occasionally catchy and addictive in the first place . It 's clearly the right direction for the band , but Yellowcard needs to further refine its new style before it can come up with something above average . " Mike Schiller of PopMatters , who was somewhat displeased with the album , wrote that the album does not " make up for the overabundance of flaccid mediocrity on display throughout most of the album " . Schiller went on to say , " Lights and Sounds may be Yellowcard ’ s attempt at a big , serious album , but the band doesn ’ t sound even remotely ready . " Nick Cowen from Drowned in Sound wrote : " Those who register for Pop @-@ Punk 101 will receive Yellowcard ’ s Lights And Sounds as their first set @-@ work ; the Jacksonville quintet 's new album would be the perfect teaching aid , as it 's technically proficient while being boring and forgettable enough not to inspire the temptation to plagiarise . " Cowen concluded that the album " is a substandard , second @-@ tier album with some strings thrown in for good measure . It 's really not worth the money in your wallet – even if that wallet is attached to a very long chain . " Now magazine claimed that the band " may be in the right place , it 's clear they 're simply incapable of realizing this clumsy faux magnum opus . " 
 Despite the mixed reaction , many critics were fond of the album . Rolling Stone 's music critic Jenny Eliscu wrote that the album " has made what ends up being one of the best straight @-@ up pop @-@ rock albums of 2006 " . <unk> also complimented the band , writing : " Like the Goo Goo Dolls ... Yellowcard have rightfully recognized the transcendent value of a big , fist @-@ pumping anthem coated with a light dose of romantic schmaltz . " Alternative Press gave the album a perfect rating , saying , " It may be one of the least ' punk ' albums a pop @-@ punk band will make this <unk> it 's probably one of the best , too . " Sputnikmusic gave the album 3 @.@ 5 out of five stars , writing : " It 's pop @-@ punk , and fairly unambitious stuff at that ... What keeps this record on its feet is the lyricism , the production and the simplicity of it all . " Heather Phares of AllMusic wrote : " On Lights and Sounds , Yellowcard sounds light years away from its One for the Kids / Where We Stand days . Granted , the band still trades in the immediate melodies and heart @-@ on @-@ sleeve lyrics that they 've used since the beginning , but major @-@ label success suits them well . " Though , Phares went on to add that the band " ends up sounding self @-@ assured instead of compromised in its big @-@ budget surroundings . " Billboard magazine gave the album 8 out of 10 stars , and claimed that Yellowcard made a " strong effort that trades sunny @-@ sounding rockers and breakup songs for weightier concerns of war and family , ' Lights ' conveys that maturity without seeming strained . " Dan McClanahan of Iowa State Daily wrote : " ... This disc will likely change people 's opinion of Yellowcard . Much more angst and a drastically matured sound make for a pleasant surprise . " McClanahan revealed that he was not looking forward to listen to the album , but admitted once he heard he knew it embraced the band 's " strengths " and that they " greatly expanded the subject matter of its songs .

 When asked about the disappointment of sales that Lights and Sounds received , Sean Mackin said : 
 I think that the band went on ... maybe not a tangent , but we had a goal in mind , and at the end of the recording process , we were so proud of how artistic we were . And I think we showed too much . I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark , and I think that the lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people . But I think that it 's all part of our evolution . We all went a bit too far . 
 Mackin also insisted that the band did not see the album as a mistake , but more of a " learning experience " , so that it would not happen again whey they work on their next project .

 = Composite bow = 
 A composite bow is a traditional bow made from horn , wood , and sinew laminated together , cf . , laminated bow . The horn is on the belly , facing the archer , and sinew on the outer side of a wooden core . When the bow is drawn , the sinew ( stretched on the outside ) and horn ( compressed on the inside ) store more energy than wood for the same length of bow . The strength can be made similar to that of all @-@ wood " self " bows , with similar draw @-@ length and therefore a similar amount of energy delivered to the arrow from a much shorter bow . However , making a composite bow requires more varieties of material than a self bow , its construction takes much more time , and the finished bow is more sensitive to moisture . 
 Composite bows have been known from archaeology and art since the second millennium BCE , but their history is not well recorded as they were developed by cultures without a written tradition . They originated among Asiatic pastoralists who used them as daily necessities , classically for mounted archery although they can also be used on foot . Such bows spread among the military ( and hunters ) of civilizations that came into contact with nomad tribes ; composite bows have been used across Asia from Korea to the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North Africa , and southwards in the Arabian peninsula and in India . The use of horn in a bow was even remarked on in Homer 's epic , The Odyssey , believed to have been written in the 8th century BCE . 
 The details of manufacture varied between the various cultures that used them . Initially the tips of the limbs were made to bend when the bow was drawn . Later , the tips were stiffened with bone or antler laths ; post @-@ classical bows usually have stiff tips , known as siyahs , which are made as an integral part of the wooden core of the bow . 
 Like other bows , they lost importance with the introduction and increasing accuracy of guns . In some areas composite bows were still used and were further developed for leisure purposes . Later Turkish bows are specialized for flight archery ( shooting for distance ) . Composite bows are still made and used in Korea and in China , and the tradition has been revived elsewhere . Modern replicas are available , often made with fiberglass bellies and backs with a natural or man @-@ made core . 
 = = Construction and materials = = 
 The wooden core gives the bow its shape and dimensional stability . It is often made of multiple pieces , joined with animal glue in V @-@ splices , so the wood must accept glue well . Pieced construction allows the sharp bends that many designs require , and the use of woods with different mechanical properties for the bending and <unk> sections . 
 The wood of the bending part of the limb ( " <unk> " ) must endure intense shearing stress , and denser woods such as hard maples are normally used in Turkish bows . Bamboo , and wood of the mulberry family , are traditional in China . Some composite bows have <unk> tips ( " siyahs " ) , which need to be stiff and light ; they may be made of woods such as Sitka spruce . 
 A thin layer of horn is glued onto what will be the belly of the bow , the side facing the archer . Water buffalo horn is very suitable , as is horn of several antelopes such as gemsbok , oryx , ibex , and that of Hungarian grey cattle . Goat and sheep horn can also be used . Most forms of cow horn are not suitable , as they soon <unk> with use . The horn can store more energy than wood in compression . 
 The sinew , soaked in animal glue , is then laid in layers on the back of the bow ; the strands of sinew are oriented along the length of the bow . The sinew is normally obtained from the lower legs and back of wild deer or domestic ungulates . Traditionally , ox tendons are considered inferior to wild @-@ game sinews since they have a higher fat content , leading to spoilage . <unk> will extend farther than wood , again allowing more energy storage . 
 Hide glue or gelatin made from fish gas bladders is used to attach layers of sinew to the back of the bow , and to attach the horn belly to the wooden core . 
 <unk> laths , if used , are attached . Both horn and laths may be bound and glued with further lengths of sinew . After months of drying the bow is ready for use . Further finishing may include thin leather or waterproof bark , to protect the bow from moisture , and recent Turkish bows were often highly decorated with colourful paints and gold leaf . 
 Strings and arrows are essential parts of the weapon system , but no type of either is specifically associated with composite bows throughout their history . 
 = = Advantages and disadvantages of composite construction = = 
 = = = Advantages = = = 
 The main advantage of composite bows over self bows ( made from a single piece of wood ) is their combination of smaller size with high power . They are therefore more convenient than self bows when the archer is mobile , as from horseback , or from a chariot . Almost all composite bows are also recurve bows as the shape curves away from the archer ; this design gives higher draw @-@ weight in the early stages of the archer 's draw , storing somewhat more total energy for a given final draw @-@ weight . It would be possible to make a wooden bow that has the same shape , length and draw @-@ weight as a traditional composite bow , but it could not store the energy , and would break before full draw . 
 For most practical non @-@ mounted archery purposes , composite construction offers no advantage ; " the initial velocity is about the same for all types of bow ... within certain limits , the design parameters ... appear to be less important than is often claimed . " However , they are superior for horsemen and in the specialized art of flight archery : " A combination of many technical factors made the composite flight bow better for flight shooting . " The higher arrow velocity is only for well @-@ designed composite bows of high draw @-@ weight . At the weights more usual for modern amateurs , the greater density of horn and sinew compared to wood usually cancels any advantage .

 Constructing composite bows requires much more time and a greater variety of materials than self bows , and the animal glue used can lose strength in humid conditions and be quickly ruined by submersion or rain ; the 6th @-@ century Byzantine military manual , the Strategikon , advised the cavalry of the Byzantine army , many of whom were armed with composite bows , to keep their bows in leather cases to keep them dry . <unk> suggests that crafting a composite bow may take a week 's work , excluding drying time ( months ) and gathering materials , while a self bow can be made in a day and dried in a week . Peoples living in humid or rainy regions historically have favoured self @-@ bows , while those living in dry or arid regions have favoured composite bows . 
 Medieval Europeans favoured self bows as hand bows , but they made composite prods for crossbows . The prods were usually well protected from rain and humidity which are prevalent in much of Europe .

 Bows of any kind seldom survive in the archaeological record . Composite bows may have been invented first by the nomads of the Asiatic steppe , who may have based it on earlier Northern Asian laminated bows . However , archaeological investigation of the Asiatic steppe is still limited and patchy ; literary records of any kind are late and scanty and seldom mention details of bows . There are arrowheads from the earliest chariot burials at <unk> Lake , part of the Sintashta culture about 2100 – 1700 BCE , but the bow that shot them has not survived . Other sites of the Sintashta culture have produced finds of horn and bone , interpreted as furniture ( grips , arrow rests , bow ends , string loops ) of bows ; there is no indication that the bending parts of these bows included anything other than wood . These finds are associated with short arrows , 50 @-@ <unk> long , and the bows themselves may have been correspondingly short . The Andronovo Culture , descendant of the Sintashta culture , was the first to extend from the Ural Mountains to Tian Shan , and its successor cultures gave rise to the Indo @-@ Aryan migration . It has been suggested that the <unk> culture ( contemporaneous with , and a neighbour to , the Andronovo culture ) used composite bows , but no archaeological evidence is known . 
 Composite bows were soon adopted and adapted by civilizations who came into contact with nomads , such as the Chinese , Assyrian , and Egyptian . Several composite bows were found in the tomb of Tutankhamun , who died in 1324 BCE . Composite bows ( and chariots ) are known in China from at least the Shang Dynasty ( 1700 – 1100 BCE ) . By the 4th century BCE , <unk> had ceased to have military importance , replaced by cavalry everywhere ( except in Britannia where charioteers are not recorded as using bows ) . 
 = = = By mounted archers = = = 
 The mounted archer became the archetypal warrior of the steppes and the composite bow was his archetypal weapon , used to protect the herds , in steppe warfare , and in incursions ( notably those of the Huns , Magyars , Mongols , and Turkic peoples such as Cumans , Oghuz and Pechenegs ) into settled lands . 
 Classic tactics for horse @-@ mounted archers included skirmishing ; they would approach , shoot , and retreat before any effective response could be made . The term Parthian shot refers to the widespread horse @-@ archer tactic of shooting backwards over the rear of their horses as they retreated . Parthians inflicted heavy defeats on Romans , the first being the Battle of Carrhae . However , horse archers did not make an army invincible ; Han General Ban Chao led successful military expeditions in the late 1st century CE that conquered as far as central Asia , and both Philip of Macedon and his son Alexander the Great defeated horse archer armies . Well @-@ led Roman armies defeated Parthian armies on several occasions and twice took the Parthian capital . 
 = = = By infantry = = = 
 Composite bows can be used without difficulty by infantry . The infantry archers of classical Greece and the Roman Empire used composite bows . The military of the Han Dynasty ( 220 BCE – 206 CE ) utilized composite crossbows , often in infantry square formations , in their many engagements against the Xiongnu . Until 1571 archers with composite bows were a main component of the forces of the Ottoman Empire , but in the Battle of Lepanto in that year they lost most of these troops and never replaced them . 
 = = Technical changes to classical times = = 
 The details of bow construction changed somewhat with time . It is not clear that the various developments of the composite bow led to measurable improvements : " the development of archery equipment may not be a process involving progressive improvements in performance . Rather , each design type represents one solution to the problem of creating a mobile weapon system capable of hurling lightweight projectiles . " 
 = = = Scythian bows , bending tips = = = 
 Variants of the Scythian bow were the dominant form in Asia until approximately the first century BCE . These were short weapons — one was 119 centimetres ( 47 in ) long when strung , with arrows perhaps 50 – 60 centimetres ( 20 – 24 in ) long — with flexible , " working " tips ; the wooden core was continuous from the centre to the tip . 
 = = = <unk> / <unk> , stiff tips = = = 
 From about the 4th century BCE , the use of stiffened ends on composite bows became widespread . The stiffened end of the bow is a " siyah " ( Arabic , Persian ) , " <unk> " ( Hungarian ) , " <unk> " ( Finnish ; both ' <unk> ' and ' <unk> ' mean ' horn ' ) or " <unk> " ( Turkish ) ; the bending section is a " <unk> " ( Arabic ) , " lapa " ( Finnish ) or " sal " ( Turkish ) . For centuries , the stiffening was accomplished by attaching laths of bone or antler to the sides of the bow at its ends . The bone or antler strips are more likely to survive burial than the rest of the bow . The first bone strips suitable for this purpose come from " graves of the fourth or third centuries " BCE . These stiffeners are found associated with nomads of the time . <unk> @-@ <unk> states that they are not found in Achaemenid Persia , nor in early Imperial Rome , nor in Han China . However <unk> attributes Roman stiffeners to about or before 9 CE . He identifies a Steppe Tradition of Scythian bows with working tips , which lasted , in Europe , until the arrival of the Huns , and a Near East or Levantine tradition with siyahs , possibly introduced by the Parni as siyahs are found in Sassanid but not Achaemenid contexts . <unk> have also been described from the Arabian peninsula . Composite bows were adopted by the Roman Empire and were made even in the cold and damp of Britannia . They were the normal weapon of later Roman archers , both infantry and cavalry units ( although Vegetius recommends training recruits " <unk> <unk> " , with wooden bows ) . 
 = = = <unk> stiffening the grip = = = 
 A new bow type , in which bone reinforcements cover the handle of the bow as well as the tips , may have developed in Central Asia during the 3rd to 2nd century BCE , with earliest finds from the area of Lake Baikal . Fittings from this type of bow appear right across Asia from Korea to the Crimea . Such bows with reinforcement of both grip and siyahs have been called “ Hun , ” “ Hunnic ” or “ <unk> @-@ nu ” composite bows . Huns did use such bows , but so did many other peoples ; <unk> termed this type the ' Qum @-@ Darya Bow ' from the Han Chinese type @-@ site at the frontier post of Loulan , at the mouth of the Qum Darya river , dated by analogy between c . 1st century BCE and the 3rd century CE . 
 With the arrival of the Huns , this tradition of bows with stiffened grips arrived in Europe . " Alanic graves in the Volga region dating to the 3rd to 4th century CE signal the adoption of the Qum @-@ Darya type by Sarmatian peoples from Hunnic groups advancing from the East . In general , Hunnic / Qum @-@ Darya bows had two pairs of ear laths identical in every respect to those found on Roman limes sites . The ear laths show only a greater proportion of longer laths ( like those of Roman examples from Bar Hill and London ) . More distinctively , the grip of the bow was stiffened by three laths . On the sides were glued a pair of trapezoidal laths with their longest edges towards the back . On the belly was glued a third lath , varying in shape but often narrow with parallel sides and splayed ends . Therefore , each bow possessed seven grip and ear laths , compared with none on the Scythian and Sarmatian bows and four ( ear ) laths on the <unk> bow . " 
 Such bows were often asymmetric , with lower limbs shorter than the upper . 
 The Huns and their successors greatly impressed their neighbours with their archery . Germanic tribes transmitted their respect orally for a millennium ; in the Scandinavian Hervarar saga , the <unk> king <unk> taunts the Huns and says , " <unk> <unk> <unk> oss <unk> né <unk> <unk> . " ( We fear neither the Huns nor their <unk> . ) The Romans , as described in the Strategikon , Procopius 's histories , and other works , changed the entire emphasis of their army , from heavy infantry to cavalry , many of them armed with bows . <unk> 's Strategikon describes the Byzantine cavalry as bow @-@ armed <unk> and lance @-@ armed <unk> . 
 = = = Additional stiffening laths = = = 
 The Qum @-@ Darya bow was superseded in the modern area of Hungary by an ' Avar ' type , with more and differently @-@ shaped laths . The grip laths stayed essentially the same except that a fourth piece was sometimes glued to the back of the handle enclosing it with bone on all four faces . The belly lath was often parallel @-@ sided with splayed ends . The siyah laths became much wider in profile above the nock and less rounded , giving a bulbous aspect . The nock was often further away from the upper end of the siyah than on Qum @-@ Darya type examples . Additional laths were usually added to the belly and back of the siyah thus enclosing both ends of the stave on four faces . This made a total of up to 12 laths on an asymmetrical bow with stiff , set back handle . Examples measured in situ suggest bow lengths of 120 – 140 cm . When unstrung the siyahs reversed sharply forward at an angle of 50 @-@ 60 degrees . 
 = = Post @-@ classical development = = 
 After the fall of the Western Roman Empire , armies of the Byzantine Empire maintained their tradition of horse archery for centuries . Byzantium finally fell to the Turks before the decline of military archery in favour of guns . Turkish armies included archers until about 1591 ( they played a major role in the Battle of Lepanto ( 1571 ) , and flight archery remained a popular sport in Istanbul until the early 19th century . Most surviving documentation of the use and construction of composite bows comes from China and the Middle East ; until reforms early in the 20th century , skill with the composite bow was an essential part of the qualification for officers in the Chinese Imperial army . 
 The composite bow was adopted throughout the Arab world , even though some Bedu tribesmen in the Hijaz retained the use of simple self bows . Persian designs were used after the conquest of the Sassanid Empire , and Turkish @-@ type bows were widely used after the Turkic expansions . Roughly speaking , Arabs favoured slightly shorter siyahs and broader limbs than the Indo @-@ Persian designs . Sometimes the protective cover on the back was painted with Arab calligraphy or geometric patterns . No design was standardized over the vast area of the Arab conquests . It was said that the best Arab composite bows were manufactured in Damascus , Syria . 
 The first surviving treatise on composite bow construction and archery was written in Arabic under Mamluk rule about 1368 . Fragments of bone laths from composite bows were found among grave goods in the United Arab Emirates dating from the period between <unk> @-@ <unk> . 
 = = = Integral wooden siyahs = = = 
 Later developments in the composite bow included siyahs made of separate pieces of wood , attached with a V @-@ splice to the wooden core of the bow , rather than strengthened by external reinforcement . Mediaeval and modern bows generally have integral wooden siyahs and lack stiffening laths . 
 = = = String bridges = = = 
 A string " bridge " or " run " is an attachment of horn or wood , used to hold the string a little further apart from the bow 's limbs at the base of the siyahs , as well as allowing the siyah to rest at an angle forward of the string . This attachment may add weight , but might give a small increase in the speed of the arrow by increasing the initial string angle and therefore the force of the draw in its early stages . Large string bridges are characteristic of Manchu ( Qing dynasty , 1644 – 1911 ) bows and late Mongolian bows , while small string bridges are characteristic of Korean , Crimean Tatar , and some Ming dynasty ( 1368 – 1644 ) bows . String bridges are not present in artwork in the time of Genghis Khan or before . 
 = = Modern living traditions of composite bows = = 
 All Eurasian composite bows derive from the same nomad origins , but every culture that used them has made its own adaptations to the basic design . The Turkish , Mongolian , and Korean bows were standardized when archery lost its military function and became a popular sport . Recent Turkish bows are optimized for flight shooting . 
 = = = Turkish bow = = = 
 This is the Ottoman development of the composite bow , presumably brought from the steppes . Turkish bows evolved , after the decline of military archery , into probably the best traditional flight bows . Their decoration often included delicate and beautiful multicoloured designs with gold . 
 = = = Chinese bow = = = 
 For millennia , archery has played a pivotal role in Chinese history . Because the cultures associated with Chinese society spanned a wide geography and time range , the techniques and equipment associated with Chinese archery are diverse . Historical sources and archaeological evidence suggest that a variety of bow designs existed throughout Chinese history . For much of the 20th century , only one Chinese traditional bow and arrow making workshop was active . However , in the beginning of the 21st century , there has been revival in interest among craftsmen looking to construct bows and arrows in the traditional Chinese style . 
 = = = Mongol bow = = = 
 The Mongolian tradition of archery is attested by an inscription on a stone stele that was found near Nerchinsk in Siberia : " While Genghis Khan was holding an assembly of Mongolian dignitaries , after his conquest of <unk> ( Khwarezm ) , <unk> ( the son of Genghis Khan 's brother ) shot a target at 335 <unk> ( 536 m ) . " The Mongol <unk> tradition was lost under the Manchus , who forbade archery ; the present <unk> tradition emerged after independence in 1921 and is based on Manchu types of bow . Mounted archery had fallen into disuse and has been revived only in the 21st century . 
 Archery with composite bows is part of the annual festival of the three virile sports ( Wrestling , <unk> , Archery ) , called " Naadam " .

 The Hungarian bow is a fairly long , approximately symmetrical , composite reflex bow with bone stiffeners .

 The Perso @-@ Parthian bow is a symmetric recurve under high tension when strung . The " arms " of the bow are supposed to reflex far enough to cross each other when the bow is unstrung . The finished bow is covered by bark , fine leather , or in some cases shark skin to keep out moisture .

 = 1906 French Grand Prix = 
 The 1906 Grand Prix de l 'Automobile Club de France , commonly known as the 1906 French Grand Prix , was a motor race held on 26 and 27 June 1906 , on closed public roads outside the city of Le Mans . The Grand Prix was organised by the Automobile Club de France ( ACF ) at the prompting of the French automobile industry as an alternative to the Gordon Bennett races , which limited each competing country 's number of entries regardless of the size of its industry . France had the largest automobile industry in Europe at the time , and in an attempt to better reflect this the Grand Prix had no limit to the number of entries by any particular country . The ACF chose a 103 @.@ 18 @-@ kilometre ( 64 @.@ 11 mi ) circuit , composed primarily of dust roads sealed with tar , which would be lapped six times on both days by each competitor , a combined race distance of 1 @,@ 238 @.@ 16 kilometres ( 769 @.@ 36 mi ) . Lasting for more than 12 hours overall , the race was won by Ferenc Szisz driving for the Renault team . FIAT driver Felice Nazzaro finished second , and Albert Clément was third in a Clément @-@ Bayard . 
 Paul Baras of Brasier set the fastest lap of the race on his first lap . He held on to the lead until the third lap , when Szisz took over first position , defending it to the finish . Hot conditions melted the road tar , which the cars kicked up into the faces of the drivers , blinding them and making the racing treacherous . Punctures were common ; tyre manufacturer Michelin introduced a detachable rim with a tyre already affixed , which could be quickly swapped onto a car after a puncture , saving a significant amount of time over manually replacing the tyre . This helped Nazzaro pass Clément on the second day , as the FIAT — unlike the Clément @-@ Bayard — made use of the rims . 
 Renault 's victory contributed to an increase in sales for the French manufacturer in the years following the race . Despite being the second to carry the title , the race has become known as the first Grand Prix . The success of the 1906 French Grand Prix prompted the ACF to run the Grand Prix again the following year , and the German automobile industry to organise the <unk> , the forerunner to the German Grand Prix , in 1907 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The first French Grand Prix originated from the Gordon Bennett races , established by American millionaire James Gordon Bennett , Jr. in 1900 . Intended to encourage automobile industries through sport , by 1903 the Gordon Bennett races had become some of the most prestigious in Europe ; their formula of closed @-@ road racing among similar cars replaced the previous model of unregulated vehicles racing between distant towns , over open roads . Entries into the Gordon Bennett races were by country , and the winning country earned the right to organise the next race . Entries were limited to three per country , which meant that although the nascent motor industry in Europe was dominated by French manufacturers , they were denied the opportunity to fully demonstrate their superiority . Instead , the rule put them on a numerical level footing with countries such as Switzerland , with only one manufacturer , and allowed Mercedes , which had factories in Germany and Austria , to field six entries : three from each country . The French governing body , the Automobile Club de France ( ACF ) , held trials between its manufacturers before each race ; in 1904 twenty @-@ nine entries competed for the three positions on offer . 
 When Léon <unk> won the 1904 race for the French manufacturer Richard @-@ Brasier , the French automobile industry proposed to the ACF that they modify the format of the 1905 Gordon Bennett race and run it simultaneously with an event which did not limit entries by nation . The ACF accepted the proposal , but decided that instead of removing limits to entries by nation , the limits would remain but would be determined by the size of each country 's industry . Under the ACF 's proposal , France was allowed fifteen entries , Germany and Britain six , and the remaining countries — Italy , Switzerland , Belgium , Austria and the United States — three cars each . 
 The French proposal was met with strong opposition from governing bodies representing the other Gordon Bennett nations , and at the instigation of Germany a meeting of the bodies was organised to settle the dispute . Although the delegates rejected the French model for the 1905 race , to avoid deadlock they agreed to use the new system of limits for the 1906 race . But when <unk> and Richard @-@ Brasier won again in 1905 , and the responsibility for organising the 1906 race fell once more to the ACF , the French ended the Gordon Bennett races and organised their own event as a replacement , the Grand Prix de l 'Automobile Club de France . 
 = = = Track = = = 
 A combined offer from the city council of Le Mans and local hoteliers to contribute funding to the Grand Prix persuaded the ACF to hold the race on the outskirts of the city , where the Automobile Club de la Sarthe devised a 103 @.@ 18 @-@ kilometre ( 64 @.@ 11 mi ) circuit . Running through farmlands and forests , the track , like most circuits of the time , formed a triangle . It started outside the village of Montfort , and headed south @-@ west towards Le Mans . Competitors then took the Fourche hairpin , which turned sharply left and slowed the cars to around 50 kilometres per hour ( 31 mph ) , and then an essentially straight road through <unk> south @-@ east towards Saint @-@ Calais . The town was bypassed with a temporary wooden plank road , as the track headed north on the next leg of the triangle . Another plank road through a forest to a minor road allowed the track to bypass most of the town of Vibraye , before it again headed north to the outskirts of La Ferté @-@ Bernard . A series of left @-@ hand turns took competitors back south @-@ west towards Montfort on the last leg of the triangle , a straight broken by a more technical winding section , near the town of <unk> . Competitors lapped the circuit twelve times over two days , six times on each day , a total distance of 1 @,@ 238 @.@ 16 kilometres ( 769 @.@ 36 mi ) . 
 To address concerns about previous races , during which spectators crowding too close to the track had been killed or injured by cars , the ACF erected 65 kilometres ( 40 mi ) of palisade fencing around the circuit , concentrated around towns and villages , and at the ends of lanes , footpaths and roads intersecting the track . The planking used to avoid the towns of Saint @-@ Calais and Vibraye was installed as an alternative to the system used in the Gordon Bennett races , where cars passing through towns would slow down to a set speed and were forbidden to overtake . Several footbridges were erected over the track , and a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ seat canopied grandstand was built at the start and finish line at Montfort . This faced the pit lane on the other side of the track , where the teams were based and could work on the cars . A tunnel under the track connected the grandstand and the pit lane . The road surface was little more than compacted dust and sharp stones which could be easily kicked up by the cars , and to limit the resulting problem of impaired visibility and punctures the ACF sealed the entire length of the track with tar . More was added to the bends of the track after cars running on them during practice broke up the surface . 
 = = = Entries and cars = = = 
 Ten French manufacturers entered cars in the Grand Prix : Clément @-@ Bayard , Hotchkiss , Gobron @-@ Brillié , Darracq , Vulpes , Brasier ( the successor to Richard @-@ Brasier ) , Panhard , Grégoire , Lorraine @-@ Dietrich and Renault . Two teams came from Italy ( FIAT and Itala ) and one ( Mercedes ) from Germany . With the exceptions of Gobron @-@ Brillié and Vulpes , which each entered one car , and Grégoire , which entered two cars , each team entered three cars , to make a total field of thirty @-@ four entries . No British or American manufacturers entered the Grand Prix . The British were suspicious that the event was designed as propaganda for the French automobile industry ; British magazine The Motor quoted French daily newspaper Le Petit Parisien as evidence of this supposed lack of sportsmanship . 
 The ACF imposed a maximum weight limit — excluding tools , upholstery , wings , lights and light fittings — of 1 @,@ 000 kilograms ( 2 @,@ 205 lb ) , with an additional 7 kilograms ( 15 lb ) allowed for a magneto or dynamo to be used for ignition . Regulations limited fuel consumption to 30 litres per 100 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 4 mpg @-@ imp ; 7 @.@ 8 mpg @-@ US ) . Every team opted for a magneto system ; all used a low @-@ tension system except Clément @-@ Bayard , Panhard , Hotchkiss , Gobron @-@ Brillié , and Renault , which used high @-@ tension . Mercedes , Brasier , Clément @-@ Bayard , FIAT and Gobron @-@ Brillié used a chain drive system for transmission ; the rest used drive shafts . All entries were fitted with four @-@ cylinder engines ; engine displacement ranged from 7 @,@ 433 cubic centimetres ( 454 cu in ) for the Grégoire to 18 @,@ 279 cubic centimetres ( 1 @,@ 115 cu in ) for the Panhard . Exhaust pipes were directed upwards to limit the dust kicked up off the roads . Teams were allowed to change drivers and equipment , but only at the end of the first day 's running , not while the race was in progress . 
 Michelin , Dunlop and Continental supplied tyres for the race . In the Grand Prix 's one major technical innovation , Michelin introduced the <unk> <unk> : a detachable rim with a tyre already affixed , which could be quickly swapped onto the car in the event of a puncture . Unlike in the Gordon Bennett races , only the driver and his riding mechanic were allowed to work on the car during the race , hence carrying the detachable rims could save time and confer a large advantage . The conventional method of changing a tyre , which involved slicing off the old tyre with a knife , and forcing the new tyre onto the rim , generally took around fifteen minutes ; replacing Michelin 's rims took less than four . The <unk> each used a full set , while the Renaults and two of the Clément @-@ Bayards used them on the rear wheels of their cars . As carrying each rim added 9 kilograms ( 20 lb ) to the weight of the car over conventional wheels and tyres , some teams — such as Itala and Panhard — could not carry them without exceeding the weight limit . 
 The Grand Prix name ( " Great Prize " ) referred to the prize of 45 @,@ 000 French francs to the race winner . The franc was pegged to the gold at 0 @.@ 290 grams per franc , which meant that the prize was worth 13 kg of gold .

 Roads around the track were closed to the public at 5 am on the morning of the race . A draw took place among the thirteen teams to determine the starting order , and assign each team a number . Each of a team 's three entries was assigned a letter , one of " A " , " B " , or " C " . Two lines of cars formed behind the start line at Montfort : cars marked " A " in one line and cars marked " B " in the other . Cars assigned the letter " C " were the last away ; they formed a single line at the side of the track so that any cars which had completed their first circuit of the track would be able to pass . Cars were dispatched at 90 @-@ second intervals , beginning at 6 am . Lorraine @-@ Dietrich driver Fernand Gabriel ( numbered " 1A " ) was scheduled to be the first competitor to start , but he stalled on the line and could not restart his car before the FIAT of Vincenzo Lancia , who was next in line , drove away . Renault 's lead driver , the Hungarian Ferenc Szisz , started next , and behind him Victor <unk> of Darracq , Paul Baras of Brasier , Camille Jenatzy of Mercedes , Louis Rigolly of Gobron @-@ Brillié and Alessandro <unk> of Itala . Philippe <unk> of Grégoire , scheduled next , was unable to start ; the only other non @-@ starter was the sole Vulpes of Marius <unk> , which was withdrawn before the race when it was found to be over the weight limit . The last of the thirty @-@ two starters — the Clément @-@ Bayard of " de la <unk> " , numbered " 13C " — left the start line at 6 : 49 : 30 am . 
 Itala driver Maurice Fabry started the fastest of the competitors ; he covered the first kilometre in 43 @.@ 4 seconds . Over the full distance of the lap Brasier 's Baras was the quickest ; his lap time of 52 minutes and 25 @.@ 4 seconds ( 52 : 25 @.@ 4 ) moved him up to third position on the road and into the lead overall . A mechanical problem caused Gabriel to lose control of his car at Saint @-@ Calais ; he regained control in time to avoid a serious accident but was forced to retire . Baras maintained his lead after the second lap , but fell back to second the next lap as Szisz took over the lead . As the day grew hotter — it reached a high of 49 ° C ( 120 ° F ) — the tar began to melt , which proved to be a greater problem than the dust ; it was kicked up by the cars into the faces of the drivers and their mechanics , seeping past their goggles and inflaming their eyes . The Renault driver , J. Edmond , was particularly affected : his broken goggles allowed more tar to seep past and rendered him nearly blind . His attempts to change the goggles at a pit stop were rejected by officials on the grounds that equipment could not be replaced mid @-@ race . Nor could another driver be substituted ; he continued for two more laps before retiring . 
 FIAT driver Aldo <unk> climbed from fourteenth on lap three to third on lap five , before his car rolled off the planks outside Vibraye . Szisz maintained the lead he had gained on lap three to finish the first day just before noon in a time of 5 hours , 45 minutes and 30 @.@ 4 seconds ( 5 : 45 : 30 @.@ 4 ) , 26 minutes ahead of Albert Clément of Clément @-@ Bayard . Despite a slow start , FIAT driver Felice Nazzaro moved up to third position , 15 minutes behind Clément . Seventeen cars completed the first day ; Henri Rougier 's Lorraine @-@ Dietrich finished last with a time of 8 : 15 : 55 @.@ 0 , two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ hours behind Szisz . All the cars that were competing the next day were moved into parc fermé , a floodlit area guarded overnight by members of the ACF , to prevent teams and drivers from working on them until the following morning . 
 The time each car set on the first day determined the time they set off on the second day , hence Szisz 's first @-@ day time of 5 hours and 45 minutes meant he started at 5 : 45 am . Following the same principle , Clément began at 6 : 11 am and Nazzaro at 6 : 26 am . This method ensured that positions on the road directly reflected the race standings . A horse , which had been trained before the race to be accustomed to the loud noise of an engine starting , towed each competitor out of parc fermé to the start line . As neither driver nor mechanic could work on their car until they had been given the signal to start the day 's running , Szisz and Clément began by heading directly to the pit lane to change tyres and service their cars . Clément completed his stop more quickly than Szisz , and Nazzaro did not stop at all , and so Clément closed his time gap to Szisz and Nazzaro closed on Clément . Jenatzy and Lancia , who were both suffering eye problems from the first day , had intended to retire from the race and be relieved by their reserve drivers . As planned , " Burton " took over Jenatzy 's car , but Lancia was forced to resume in his street clothes when his replacement driver could not be found when the car was due to start . 
 Hotchkiss driver Elliott Shepard , who finished the first day in fourth , less than four minutes behind Nazzaro , spent half @-@ an @-@ hour working on his car at the start of the second day , fitting new tyres and changing liquids . On the eighth lap , he ran off the wooden planking at Saint @-@ Calais but was able to resume ; a wheel failure later in the lap caused him to run into a bank of earth and forced him to retire . Panhard driver Georges Teste crashed early in the day and retired , as did Claude <unk> of Renault ; the sole Gobron @-@ Brillié of Rigolly suffered radiator damage on lap seven and was forced out of the race . After two laps ' running on the second day , second @-@ placed Clément had established a 23 @-@ minute lead over Nazzaro , but this was reduced to three minutes on the following lap . Despite Nazzaro passing Clément on lap ten , a refuelling stop for the FIAT soon after put Clément back in front . Nazzaro passed again , and led Clément into the last lap of the race by less than a minute . 
 Szisz 's Renault suffered a broken rear suspension on the tenth lap , but his lead was so great ( more than 30 minutes ) that he could afford to drive cautiously with the damage . He took the black flag of the winner at the finish line after a combined total from the two days of 12 : 12 : 07 @.@ 0 ; he had also been quicker on the straight than any other driver , reaching a top speed of 154 kilometres per hour ( 96 mph ) . He finished 32 minutes ahead of second @-@ placed Nazzaro , who was in turn 3 minutes ahead of Clément . Jules <unk> 's Brasier was fourth , ahead of Lancia and Panhard driver George Heath . Baras — whose first lap was the fastest of any car during the race — was seventh , ahead of Arthur <unk> of Lorraine @-@ Dietrich , " <unk> " of Brasier , and " Burton " . The last finisher , the Mercedes driver " <unk> " , was eleventh , more than four hours behind Szisz . Rougier , who had set the fastest lap of the day with a time of 53 : 16 @.@ 4 , had retired on lap ten after a long series of punctures . Of the other retirements , <unk> , René Hanriot ( riding mechanic Jean Chassagne ) and Louis Wagner of Darracq suffered engine problems ; the radiators on the cars of Rigolly of Gobron @-@ Brillié , Xavier <unk> de Bosch of Grégoire and <unk> of Itala failed ; Pierre de <unk> of Itala , Shepard and Hubert Le Blon of Hotchkiss , A. Villemain of Clément @-@ Bayard and Vincenzo Florio of Mercedes withdrew after wheel failures ; Gabriel of Lorraine @-@ Dietrich , " de la <unk> " of Clément @-@ Bayard and Henri Tart of Panhard retired because of other mechanical problems ; and Fabry of Itala , <unk> of FIAT , Teste of Panhard , <unk> of Renault and Jacques <unk> of Hotchkiss suffered crash damage . Edmond of Renault was the only competitor whose retirement was the result of driver injury . 
 = = Post @-@ race and legacy = = 
 The top three finishers were escorted to the grandstand to collect their trophies . In an interview after the race , Szisz reflected on the " anxiety " he had felt as he drove the final laps : " I feared something small which would take away victory at the moment when it had seemed to be won . " The prestige Renault gained from Szisz 's victory led to an increase in sales for the company , from around 1 @,@ 600 cars in 1906 to more than 3 @,@ 000 a year later , and increasing to more than 4 @,@ 600 in 1908 . But the race had not proven the superiority of the French motorcar ; an Italian car had finished second and only seven of the twenty @-@ three French cars that had started the race finished it . 
 Reflections on the race by the organisers and the media generally concluded that the Grand Prix had been a poor replacement for the Gordon Bennett races . In part , this had been because the race was too long , and the system of starting the race — with each car leaving at 90 @-@ second intervals — had meant that there had been very little interaction between the competitors , simply cars driving their own races to time . The ACF decided that too much pressure had been put on drivers and riding mechanics by forbidding others to work on the cars during the race . It was also felt that the outcome of the race had been too dependent on the use of Michelin 's detachable rims . Clément had driven the only Clément @-@ Bayard to not have the rims , and it was thought that this contributed to Nazzaro passing him on the second day as he stopped to change tyres . Despite this , the ACF decided to run the Grand Prix again the following year . The publicity generated by the race prompted the German governing body to organise a similar event that favoured their own industry . The forerunner to the German Grand Prix , the <unk> ( Kaiser 's Prize ) was raced in 1907 . 
 The conference held in 1904 to consider the French proposal for a change in formula to the Gordon Bennett races led to the formation of the Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus ( AIACR ; the predecessor of the Fédération Internationale de l 'Automobile ) , the body responsible for regulating international motorsport . Although a smaller race held in 1901 had awarded the " Grand Prix de Pau " , the 1906 race outside Le Mans was the first genuinely international race to carry the label " Grand Prix " . Until the First World War it was the only annual race to be called a Grand Prix ( often , the Grand Prix ) , and is commonly known as " the first Grand Prix " .

 = Cyclone Hary = 
 Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Hary was the strongest tropical cyclone in the 2001 – 02 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season and the strongest storm worldwide in 2002 . Developing on March 5 from the monsoon trough , the storm initially moved generally to the west and gradually intensified . With favorable conditions , Hary quickly intensified on March 7 , developing an eye and well @-@ defined outflow . After reaching an initial peak , the cyclone briefly weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle , by which time the storm turned southwestward toward Madagascar . Hary re @-@ intensified and attained peak winds of 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) on March 10 just offshore eastern Madagascar , which made it the first very intense tropical cyclone since 2000 . 
 After peaking , Hary weakened due to land interaction , and it struck Madagascar southeast of Antalaha . It was turning south over land , and as a result it quickly moved offshore . There were three deaths in the country , one of which from electrocution . There was locally heavy crop damage , and four bridges were destroyed . However , the damage was considered minimal , given the intensity of the storm . After affecting Madagascar , Hary accelerated to the southeast , and the eastern periphery of the circulation moved over Réunion . On the mountain peaks of the island , rainfall reached 1 @,@ 344 mm ( 52 @.@ 9 in ) , although it was much less near the coast . The rainfall caused flooding , killing one person , and 20 @,@ 000 people were left without power . Hary became extratropical on March 13 , although its remnants continued for several days as a powerful mid @-@ latitude storm . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In early March 2002 , tropical activity was minimal in the southern Indian Ocean , limited to an area of convection , or thunderstorms , located southwest of Diego Garcia along the monsoon . On March 4 , a broad and elongated low pressure area developed within the system , although moderate wind shear in the region initially prevented significant development . The next day , the circulation became better defined , and after being nearly stationary for a few days , it began moving steadily to the west @-@ southwest , due to a ridge to the southeast . On March 5 , Météo @-@ France ( MFR ) classified the system as a tropical disturbance , and later Tropical Depression 11 . At 0000 UTC on March 6 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 18S , and six hours later MFR upgraded the system to Moderate Tropical Storm Hary . 
 After becoming a tropical storm , Hary was located beneath an anticyclone and in an area of minimal wind shear . It turned to a general westward motion , with its convection wrapping into the center and developing into a central dense overcast . A ragged eye formed on March 7 , which gradually became more organized . That day , the JTWC upgraded Hary to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane , with 1 minute winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . By that time , the storm had developed good outflow , and was in the midst of a period of rapid deepening . Early on March 8 , MFR upgraded Hary to tropical cyclone status , and the storm became very compact , with gales extending only 75 km ( 47 mi ) from the center . While rounding the northwest edge of a ridge , Hary turned to the southwest late on March 8 , toward the northeast coast of Madagascar . After reaching 10 minute sustained winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) , Hary weakened slightly due to an eyewall replacement cycle , which resulted in the eye becoming indistinct until it was replaced by a larger outer eyewall . After the new eye formed , the cyclone again intensified , and Hary became a very intense tropical cyclone early on March 10 , with peak 10 minute winds of 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) , according to the MF . It was the first very intense tropical cyclone since Cyclone Hudah in 2000 , and made Hary the strongest storm of the season . Around that time , the JTWC estimated that Hary attained peak 1 minute winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) . 
 Around the time of its peak intensity , Hary was located about 70 km ( 43 mi ) off the east coast of Madagascar . While approaching the coast , the cyclone was turning toward the south , although its motion was not southerly enough to keep the storm offshore . At around 1200 UTC on March 10 , Hary made landfall about 55 km ( 34 mi ) southeast of Antalaha , slightly below peak intensity . The eye rapidly weakened before landfall , possibly due to another replacement cycle , and land interaction further deteriorated the storm . By late on March 10 , MFR downgraded Hary to tropical cyclone status , with winds of 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) , about 50 km ( 31 mi ) east of Île Sainte @-@ Marie . Subsequently , Hary turned more toward the south @-@ southeast , steered by an approaching trough that increased wind shear . The cyclone stopped weakening , and the eye began redeveloping . Early on March 12 , Hary passed about 350 km ( 220 mi ) west of the French island of Réunion , when the JTWC estimated its 1 minute winds were about 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . Later that day , the combination of increasing wind shear and cooler waters weakened the cyclone , resulting in the cloud structure to deteriorate . After the circulation became fully exposed from the convection , MFR estimated Hary became extratropical around 1200 UTC on March 13 . The circulation expanded greatly afterward as the storm continued generally to the southeast . The remnants of Hary re @-@ intensified on March 17 while passing about 250 km ( 160 mi ) southwest of Île Amsterdam in the south @-@ central Indian Ocean . It moved south of the 40th parallel south , and continued as a powerful storm in the westerlies . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Cyclone Hary passed about 100 km ( 62 mi ) south of the Agalega Islands on March 7 , producing winds of only 37 km / h ( 23 mph ) ; this was due to the cyclone 's small size . 
 On March 9 , as Hary intensified to the northeast of Madagascar , officials in Antsiranana Province placed the area under a state of alert . The following day , the storm clipped the eastern portion of the province as a Very Intense Tropical Cyclone , with maximum winds estimated at 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) . While passing near Île Sainte @-@ Marie , the storm produced a wind gust of 83 km / h ( 52 mph ) , although the storm was weakening and located east of the island at the time . Hary dropped heavy rainfall in eastern Madagascar , and a 24 ‑ hour peak of 243 mm ( 9 @.@ 6 in ) was reported in Tamatave . Initially , communication difficulties prevented reports of damage from leaving the region . Despite the intensity of the storm , overall damage was minimal , and much less than predicted . Two bridges were destroyed each in Antalaha District and Fenoarivo Atsinanana . Further south in Toamasina , high winds downed telephone lines and cut communications . Hary destroyed a hospital , and along its path it severely damaged food crops . One person died from electrocution , and there were three deaths overall in the country . 
 Although the center of Cyclone Hary passed well to the west of Réunion , heavy rains associated with the storm caused significant flooding on the island . The cyclone began affecting the island when it was located over Madagascar , after the large circulation spread humid air to the area and produced heavy rainfall through orographic lift . Over a 12 ‑ hour span , 134 mm ( 5 @.@ 3 in ) fell in La Plaine @-@ des @-@ Palmistes , and the highest rainfall was 1 @,@ 344 mm ( 52 @.@ 9 in ) in Bébourg during the storm 's passage . The heaviest rainfall occurred at high altitudes , and along the coast , rainfall reached about 372 mm ( 14 @.@ 6 in ) in Saint @-@ Philippe . These rains caused the Ravine du <unk> to swell and flood nearby Saint @-@ Denis . One person drowned after attempting to cross the swollen river . Several roads were washed out across the region , cutting off Cilaos from nearby areas . High winds , peaking at 173 km / h ( 107 mph ) , associated with Hary 's passage left approximately 20 @,@ 000 residences without power . Hary also produced 5 m ( 16 ft ) waves during its passage . There was no major damage on Réunion , which was still recovering from the deadly Cyclone Dina two months prior . Rainfall from Hary spread to nearby Mauritius , although effects there were not as severe . 
 = Liquid crystal = 
 Liquid crystals ( LCs ) are matter in a state which has properties between those of conventional liquids and those of solid crystals . For instance , a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid , but its molecules may be oriented in a crystal @-@ like way . There are many different types of liquid @-@ crystal phases , which can be distinguished by their different optical properties ( such as birefringence ) . When viewed under a microscope using a polarized light source , different liquid crystal phases will appear to have distinct textures . The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid @-@ crystal molecules are oriented in different directions . Within a domain , however , the molecules are well ordered . LC materials may not always be in a liquid @-@ crystal phase ( just as water may turn into ice or steam ) . 
 Liquid crystals can be divided into thermotropic , lyotropic and metallotropic phases . Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of organic molecules , although a few minerals are also known . Thermotropic LCs exhibit a phase transition into the liquid @-@ crystal phase as temperature is changed . Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and concentration of the liquid @-@ crystal molecules in a solvent ( typically water ) . Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules ; their liquid @-@ crystal transition depends not only on temperature and concentration , but also on the inorganic @-@ organic composition ratio . 
 Examples of liquid crystals can be found both in the natural world and in technological applications . Most contemporary electronic displays use liquid crystals . Lyotropic liquid @-@ crystalline phases are abundant in living systems but can also be found in the mineral world . For example , many proteins and cell membranes are liquid crystals . Other well @-@ known examples of liquid crystals are solutions of soap and various related detergents , as well as the tobacco mosaic virus , and some clays . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1888 , Austrian botanical physiologist Friedrich Reinitzer , working at the Karl @-@ Ferdinands @-@ Universität , examined the physico @-@ chemical properties of various derivatives of cholesterol which now belong to the class of materials known as cholesteric liquid crystals . Previously , other researchers had observed distinct color effects when cooling cholesterol derivatives just above the freezing point , but had not associated it with a new phenomenon . Reinitzer perceived that color changes in a derivative cholesteryl benzoate were not the most peculiar feature . 
 He found that cholesteryl benzoate does not melt in the same manner as other compounds , but has two melting points . At 145 @.@ 5 ° C ( 293 @.@ 9 ° F ) it melts into a cloudy liquid , and at 178 @.@ 5 ° C ( 353 @.@ 3 ° F ) it melts again and the cloudy liquid becomes clear . The phenomenon is reversible . Seeking help from a physicist , on March 14 , 1888 , he wrote to Otto Lehmann , at that time a Privatdozent in Aachen . They exchanged letters and samples . Lehmann examined the intermediate cloudy fluid , and reported seeing crystallites . Reinitzer 's Viennese colleague von Zepharovich also indicated that the intermediate " fluid " was crystalline . The exchange of letters with Lehmann ended on April 24 , with many questions unanswered . Reinitzer presented his results , with credits to Lehmann and von Zepharovich , at a meeting of the Vienna Chemical Society on May 3 , 1888 . 
 By that time , Reinitzer had discovered and described three important features of cholesteric liquid crystals ( the name coined by Otto Lehmann in 1904 ) : the existence of two melting points , the reflection of circularly polarized light , and the ability to rotate the polarization direction of light . 
 After his accidental discovery , Reinitzer did not pursue studying liquid crystals further . The research was continued by Lehmann , who realized that he had encountered a new phenomenon and was in a position to investigate it : In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy . Lehmann started a systematic study , first of cholesteryl benzoate , and then of related compounds which exhibited the double @-@ melting phenomenon . He was able to make observations in polarized light , and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage ( sample holder equipped with a heater ) enabling high temperature observations . The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow , but other features , particularly the signature under a microscope , convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid . By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie . 
 Lehmann 's work was continued and significantly expanded by the German chemist Daniel <unk> , who from the beginning of 20th century until his retirement in 1935 , had synthesized most of the liquid crystals known . However , liquid crystals were not popular among scientists and the material remained a pure scientific curiosity for about 80 years . 
 After World War II work on the synthesis of liquid crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe . George William Gray , a prominent researcher of liquid crystals , began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s . His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid crystalline state and developed a better understanding of how to design molecules that exhibit the state . His book Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals became a guidebook on the subject . One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid crystals was Glenn H. Brown , starting in 1953 at the University of Cincinnati and later at Kent State University . In 1965 , he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals , in Kent , Ohio , with about 100 of the world ’ s top liquid crystal scientists in attendance . This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field , which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials . 
 Liquid crystal materials became a focus of research in the development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at RCA Laboratories . When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a nematic liquid crystal at 125 ° C , he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains ( now known as Williams Domains ) . This led his colleague George H. Heilmeier to perform research on a liquid crystal @-@ based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions . But the para @-@ <unk> that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116 ° C , which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product . A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed . 
 In 1966 , Joel E. <unk> and Joseph A. Castellano , research chemists in Heilmeier group at RCA , discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed only in the number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room @-@ temperature nematic liquid crystals . A ternary mixture of Schiff base compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22 – 105 ° C. Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made . The team then proceeded to prepare numerous mixtures of nematic compounds many of which had much lower melting points . This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide operating temperature range eventually became the industry standard and is used to this very day to tailor materials to meet specific applications . 
 In 1969 , Hans <unk> succeeded in synthesizing a substance that had a nematic phase at room temperature , <unk> , which is one of the most popular subjects of liquid crystal research . The next step to commercialization of liquid crystal displays was the synthesis of further chemically stable substances ( <unk> ) with low melting temperatures by George Gray . That work with Ken Harrison and the UK MOD ( RRE Malvern ) , in 1973 , led to design of new materials resulting in rapid adoption of small area LCDs within electronic products . 
 These molecules are rod @-@ shaped ; some are created in the lab and some could appear spontaneously in nature . Since then , two new types of LC molecules were discovered , both are man @-@ make : disc @-@ shaped ( created by S. Chandrasekhar 's group in India , 1977 ) and bowl @-@ shaped ( invented by Lui Lam in China , 1982 , and synthesized in Europe three years later ) . 
 In 1991 , when liquid crystal displays were already well established , Pierre @-@ Gilles de Gennes working at the Université Paris @-@ Sud received the Nobel Prize in physics " for discovering that methods developed for studying order phenomena in simple systems can be generalized to more complex forms of matter , in particular to liquid crystals and polymers " . 
 = = Design of liquid crystalline materials = = 
 A large number of chemical compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases . Despite significant differences in chemical composition , these molecules have some common features in chemical and physical properties . There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals : discotics , bowlics and rod @-@ shaped molecules . <unk> are flat disc @-@ like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings ; the core in a <unk> is not flat but like a rice bowl ( a three @-@ dimensional object ) . This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering , for both discotics and bowlics . Rod @-@ shaped molecules have an elongated , anisotropic geometry which allows for preferential alignment along one spatial direction . 
 • The molecular shape should be relatively thin , flat or bowl @-@ like , especially within rigid molecular frameworks . 
 • The molecular length should be at least 1 @.@ 3 nm , consistent with the presence of long alkyl group on many room @-@ temperature liquid crystals . 
 • The structure should not be branched or angular , except for the bowlics . 
 • A low melting point is preferable in order to avoid metastable , <unk> liquid crystalline phases . Low @-@ temperature <unk> behavior in general is technologically more useful , and alkyl terminal groups promote this . 
 An extended , structurally rigid , highly anisotropic shape seems to be the main criterion for liquid crystalline behavior , and as a result many liquid crystalline materials are based on benzene rings . 
 = = Liquid @-@ crystal phases = = 
 The various liquid @-@ crystal phases ( called mesophases ) can be characterized by the type of ordering . One can distinguish positional order ( whether molecules are arranged in any sort of ordered lattice ) and orientational order ( whether molecules are mostly pointing in the same direction ) , and moreover order can be either short @-@ range ( only between molecules close to each other ) or long @-@ range ( extending to larger , sometimes macroscopic , dimensions ) . Most thermotropic LCs will have an isotropic phase at high temperature . That is that heating will eventually drive them into a conventional liquid phase characterized by random and isotropic molecular ordering ( little to no long @-@ range order ) , and fluid @-@ like flow behavior . Under other conditions ( for instance , lower temperature ) , a LC might inhabit one or more phases with significant anisotropic orientational structure and short @-@ range orientational order while still having an ability to flow . 
 The ordering of liquid crystalline phases is extensive on the molecular scale . This order extends up to the entire domain size , which may be on the order of micrometers , but usually does not extend to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical crystalline solids . However some techniques , such as the use of boundaries or an applied electric field , can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample . The ordering in a liquid crystal might extend along only one dimension , with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions . 
 = = = Thermotropic liquid crystals = = = 
 Thermotropic phases are those that occur in a certain temperature range . If the temperature rise is too high , thermal motion will destroy the delicate cooperative ordering of the LC phase , pushing the material into a conventional isotropic liquid phase . At too low temperature , most LC materials will form a conventional crystal . Many thermotropic LCs exhibit a variety of phases as temperature is changed . For instance , on heating a particular type of LC molecule ( called mesogen ) may exhibit various smectic phases followed by the nematic phase and finally the isotropic phase as temperature is increased . An example of a compound displaying thermotropic LC behavior is para @-@ <unk> . 
 = = = = <unk> phase = = = = 
 One of the most common LC phases is the nematic . The word nematic comes from the Greek <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) , which means " thread " . This term originates from the thread @-@ like topological defects observed in nematics , which are formally called ' <unk> ' . Nematics also exhibit so @-@ called " hedgehog " topological defects . In a nematic phase , the <unk> or rod @-@ shaped organic molecules have no positional order , but they self @-@ align to have long @-@ range directional order with their long axes roughly parallel . Thus , the molecules are free to flow and their center of mass positions are randomly distributed as in a liquid , but still maintain their long @-@ range directional order . Most nematics are uniaxial : they have one axis that is longer and preferred , with the other two being equivalent ( can be approximated as cylinders or rods ) . However , some liquid crystals are biaxial nematics , meaning that in addition to orienting their long axis , they also orient along a secondary axis . Nematics have fluidity similar to that of ordinary ( isotropic ) liquids but they can be easily aligned by an external magnetic or electric field . Aligned nematics have the optical properties of uniaxial crystals and this makes them extremely useful in liquid crystal displays ( LCD ) . 
 = = = = Smectic phases = = = = 
 The smectic phases , which are found at lower temperatures than the nematic , form well @-@ defined layers that can slide over one another in a manner similar to that of soap . The word " smectic " originates from the Latin word " <unk> " , meaning cleaning , or having soap @-@ like properties . The <unk> are thus <unk> ordered along one direction . In the Smectic A phase , the molecules are oriented along the layer normal , while in the Smectic C phase they are tilted away from it . These phases are liquid @-@ like within the layers . There are many different smectic phases , all characterized by different types and degrees of positional and orientational order . 
 = = = = Chiral phases = = = = 
 The chiral nematic phase exhibits chirality ( handedness ) . This phase is often called the cholesteric phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives . Only chiral molecules ( i.e. , those that have no internal planes of symmetry ) can give rise to such a phase . This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director , with the molecular axis parallel to the director . The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing , which results in longer @-@ range chiral order . In the smectic C * phase ( an asterisk denotes a chiral phase ) , the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure ( as in the other smectic phases ) , with the molecules tilted by a finite angle with respect to the layer normal . The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next , producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal . 
 The chiral pitch , p , refers to the distance over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360 ° twist ( but note that the structure of the chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half @-@ pitch , since in this phase directors at 0 ° and ± 180 ° are equivalent ) . The pitch , p , typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host ( an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material ) , allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly . In some liquid crystal systems , the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light . This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties , such as Bragg reflection and low @-@ threshold laser emission , and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications . For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest @-@ order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis , whereas for oblique incidence higher @-@ order reflections become permitted . <unk> liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized light when it is incident along the helical axis and elliptically polarized if it comes in obliquely . 
 Blue phases are liquid crystal phases that appear in the temperature range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid phase . Blue phases have a regular three @-@ dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers , and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice . It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals . 
 Although blue phases are of interest for fast light modulators or tunable photonic crystals , they exist in a very narrow temperature range , usually less than a few kelvin . Recently the stabilization of blue phases over a temperature range of more than 60 K including room temperature ( 260 – 326 K ) has been demonstrated . Blue phases stabilized at room temperature allow electro @-@ optical switching with response times of the order of 10 − 4 s . 
 In May 2008 , the first Blue Phase Mode LCD panel had been developed . 
 = = = = <unk> phases = = = = 
 Disk @-@ shaped LC molecules can orient themselves in a layer @-@ like fashion known as the discotic nematic phase . If the disks pack into stacks , the phase is called a discotic columnar . The columns themselves may be organized into rectangular or hexagonal arrays . Chiral discotic phases , similar to the chiral nematic phase , are also known . 
 = = = = Bowlic phases = = = = 
 Bowl @-@ shaped LC molecules , like in discotics , can form columnar phases . Other phases , such as nonpolar nematic , polar nematic , <unk> , donut and onion phases , have been predicted . Bowlic phases , except nonpolar nematic , are polar phases . 
 = = = Lyotropic liquid crystals = = = 
 A lyotropic liquid crystal consists of two or more components that exhibit liquid @-@ crystalline properties in certain concentration ranges . In the lyotropic phases , solvent molecules fill the space around the compounds to provide fluidity to the system . In contrast to thermotropic liquid crystals , these <unk> have another degree of freedom of concentration that enables them to induce a variety of different phases . 
 A compound that has two immiscible hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts within the same molecule is called an amphiphilic molecule . Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid @-@ crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part . These structures are formed through the micro @-@ phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale . Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal . 
 The content of water or other solvent molecules changes the self @-@ assembled structures . At very low amphiphile concentration , the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering . At slightly higher ( but still low ) concentration , amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into micelles or vesicles . This is done so as to ' hide ' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core , exposing a hydrophilic ( water @-@ soluble ) surface to aqueous solution . These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution , however . At higher concentration , the assemblies will become ordered . A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase , where the amphiphiles form long cylinders ( again with a hydrophilic surface ) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice . This is called the middle soap phase . At still higher concentration , a lamellar phase ( neat soap phase ) may form , wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water . For some systems , a cubic ( also called viscous isotropic ) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases , wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice . These spheres may also be connected to one another , forming a <unk> cubic phase . 
 The objects created by amphiphiles are usually spherical ( as in the case of micelles ) , but may also be disc @-@ like ( <unk> ) , rod @-@ like , or biaxial ( all three micelle axes are distinct ) . These anisotropic self @-@ assembled nano @-@ structures can then order themselves in much the same way as thermotropic liquid crystals do , forming large @-@ scale versions of all the thermotropic phases ( such as a nematic phase of rod @-@ shaped micelles ) . 
 For some systems , at high concentrations , inverse phases are observed . That is , one may generate an inverse hexagonal columnar phase ( columns of water encapsulated by amphiphiles ) or an inverse micellar phase ( a bulk liquid crystal sample with spherical water cavities ) . 
 A generic progression of phases , going from low to high amphiphile concentration , is : 
 Discontinuous cubic phase ( micellar cubic phase ) 
 Hexagonal phase ( hexagonal columnar phase ) ( middle phase ) 
 <unk> phase 
 <unk> cubic phase 
 Reverse hexagonal columnar phase 
 Inverse cubic phase ( Inverse micellar phase ) 
 Even within the same phases , their self @-@ assembled structures are tunable by the concentration : for example , in lamellar phases , the layer distances increase with the solvent volume . Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions , it is more difficult to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals . 
 Similar phases and characteristics can be observed in immiscible <unk> copolymers .

 Liquid crystal phases can also be based on low @-@ melting inorganic phases like ZnCl2 that have a structure formed of linked tetrahedra and easily form glasses . The addition of long chain soap @-@ like molecules leads to a series of new phases that show a variety of liquid crystalline behavior both as a function of the inorganic @-@ organic composition ratio and of temperature . This class of materials has been named metallotropic .

 Thermotropic mesophases are detected and characterized by two major methods , the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy , in which a small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers ; the sample was then heated and cooled . As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light , it would appear very dark , whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way , leading to brightness and color gradients . This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase , as the different phases are defined by their particular order , which must be observed . The second method , differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) , allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies . In DSC , a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time . During phase transitions , the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change . These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions , such as key liquid crystal transitions . 
 Lyotropic mesophases are analyzed in a similar fashion , though these experiments are somewhat more complex , as the concentration of mesogen is a key factor . These experiments are run at various concentrations of mesogen in order to analyze that impact . 
 = = Biological liquid crystals = = 
 Lyotropic liquid @-@ crystalline phases are abundant in living systems , the study of which is referred to as lipid polymorphism . Accordingly , lyotropic liquid crystals attract particular attention in the field of biomimetic chemistry . In particular , biological membranes and cell membranes are a form of liquid crystal . Their constituent molecules ( e.g. phospholipids ) are perpendicular to the membrane surface , yet the membrane is flexible . These lipids vary in shape ( see page on lipid polymorphism ) . The constituent molecules can inter @-@ mingle easily , but tend not to leave the membrane due to the high energy requirement of this process . Lipid molecules can flip from one side of the membrane to the other , this process being catalyzed by flippases and floppases ( depending on the direction of movement ) . These liquid crystal membrane phases can also host important proteins such as receptors freely " floating " inside , or partly outside , the membrane , e.g. CCT . 
 Many other biological structures exhibit liquid @-@ crystal behavior . For instance , the concentrated protein solution that is extruded by a spider to generate silk is , in fact , a liquid crystal phase . The precise ordering of molecules in silk is critical to its renowned strength . DNA and many polypeptides can also form LC phases and this too forms an important part of current academic research . 
 = = Mineral liquid crystals = = 
 Examples of liquid crystals can also be found in the mineral world , most of them being <unk> first discovered was Vanadium ( V ) oxide , by Zocher in 1925 . Since then , few others have been discovered and studied in details . The existence of a true nematic phase in the case of the smectic clays family , was raised by Langmuir in 1938 , but remained open for a very long time and was only solved recently . With the rapid development of <unk> and the synthesis of many new anisotropic nanoparticles , the number of such mineral liquid crystals is quickly increasing with for example , carbon nanotubes and graphene . A lamellar phase was even discovered , <unk> that exhibit <unk> up to ~ 250 nm for the <unk> distance . 
 = = Pattern formation in liquid crystals = = 
 Anisotropy of liquid crystals is a property not observed in other fluids . This anisotropy makes flows of liquid crystals behave more differentially than those of ordinary fluids . For example , injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates ( viscous fingering ) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow , with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns . This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy ( surface tension ) between different liquid crystal phases . This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature , and is so strong that usually facets appear . When temperature is changed one of the phases grows , forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change . Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion , anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions , which has also an effect on the final shape . 
 = = Theoretical treatment of liquid crystals = = 
 Microscopic theoretical treatment of fluid phases can become quite complicated , owing to the high material density , meaning that strong interactions , hard @-@ core <unk> , and many @-@ body correlations cannot be ignored . In the case of liquid crystals , anisotropy in all of these interactions further complicates analysis . There are a number of fairly simple theories , however , that can at least predict the general behavior of the phase transitions in liquid crystal systems . 
 = = = Director = = = 
 As we already saw above , the nematic liquid crystals are composed of rod @-@ like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another . To describe this anisotropic structure , a dimensionless unit vector n called the director , is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules in the neighborhood of any point . Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis , n and -n are fully equivalent . 
 = = = Order parameter = = = 
 The description of liquid crystals involves an analysis of order . A second rank symmetric <unk> tensor order parameter is used to describe the orientational order of a nematic liquid crystal , although a scalar order parameter is usually sufficient to describe uniaxial nematic liquid crystals . To make this quantitative , an orientational order parameter is usually defined based on the average of the second Legendre polynomial : 
 <formula> 
 where <formula> is the angle between the liquid @-@ crystal molecular axis and the local director ( which is the ' preferred direction ' in a volume element of a liquid crystal sample , also representing its local optical axis ) . The brackets denote both a temporal and spatial average . This definition is convenient , since for a completely random and isotropic sample , S = 0 , whereas for a perfectly aligned sample S = 1 . For a typical liquid crystal sample , S is on the order of 0 @.@ 3 to 0 @.@ 8 , and generally decreases as the temperature is raised . In particular , a sharp drop of the order parameter to 0 is observed when the system undergoes a phase transition from an LC phase into the isotropic phase . The order parameter can be measured experimentally in a number of ways ; for instance , <unk> , birefringence , Raman scattering , NMR and EPR can be used to determine S. 
 The order of a liquid crystal could also be characterized by using other even Legendre polynomials ( all the odd polynomials average to zero since the director can point in either of two antiparallel directions ) . These higher @-@ order averages are more difficult to measure , but can yield additional information about molecular ordering . 
 A positional order parameter is also used to describe the ordering of a liquid crystal . It is characterized by the variation of the density of the center of mass of the liquid crystal molecules along a given vector . In the case of positional variation along the z @-@ axis the density <formula> is often given by : 
 <formula> 
 The complex positional order parameter is defined as <formula> and <formula> the average density . Typically only the first two terms are kept and higher order terms are ignored since most phases can be described adequately using sinusoidal functions . For a perfect nematic <formula> and for a smectic phase <formula> will take on complex values . The complex nature of this order parameter allows for many parallels between nematic to smectic phase transitions and conductor to superconductor transitions . 
 = = = Onsager hard @-@ rod model = = = 
 A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase transitions is the hard @-@ rod model proposed by Lars Onsager . This theory considers the volume excluded from the center @-@ of @-@ mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another . Specifically , if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another , there is very little volume that is excluded from the center @-@ of @-@ mass of the approaching cylinder ( it can come quite close to the other cylinder ) . If , however , the cylinders are at some angle to one another , then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder 's center @-@ of @-@ mass cannot enter ( due to the hard @-@ rod repulsion between the two idealized objects ) . Thus , this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder ( there are fewer states available to it ) . 
 The fundamental insight here is that , whilst parallel arrangements of anisotropic objects lead to a decrease in orientational entropy , there is an increase in positional entropy . Thus in some case greater positional order will be <unk> favorable . This theory thus predicts that a solution of rod @-@ shaped objects will undergo a phase transition , at sufficient concentration , into a nematic phase . Although this model is conceptually helpful , its mathematical formulation makes several assumptions that limit its applicability to real systems . 
 = = = Maier – Saupe mean field theory = = = 
 This statistical theory , proposed by Alfred Saupe and Wilhelm Maier , includes contributions from an attractive intermolecular potential from an induced dipole moment between adjacent liquid crystal molecules . The anisotropic attraction stabilizes parallel alignment of neighboring molecules , and the theory then considers a mean @-@ field average of the interaction . Solved self @-@ consistently , this theory predicts thermotropic nematic @-@ isotropic phase transitions , consistent with experiment . 
 = = = McMillan 's model = = = 
 McMillan 's model , proposed by William McMillan , is an extension of the Maier – Saupe mean field theory used to describe the phase transition of a liquid crystal from a nematic to a smectic A phase . It predicts that the phase transition can be either continuous or discontinuous depending on the strength of the short @-@ range interaction between the molecules . As a result , it allows for a triple critical point where the nematic , isotropic , and smectic A phase meet . Although it predicts the existence of a triple critical point , it does not successfully predict its value . The model utilizes two order parameters that describe the orientational and positional order of the liquid crystal . The first is simply the average of the second Legendre polynomial and the second order parameter is given by : 
 <formula> 
 The values zi , <unk> , and d are the position of the molecule , the angle between the molecular axis and director , and the layer spacing . The postulated potential energy of a single molecule is given by : 
 <formula> 
 Here constant α quantifies the strength of the interaction between adjacent molecules . The potential is then used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the system assuming thermal equilibrium . It results in two self @-@ consistency equations that must be solved numerically , the solutions of which are the three stable phases of the liquid crystal . 
 = = = Elastic continuum theory = = = 
 In this formalism , a liquid crystal material is treated as a continuum ; molecular details are entirely ignored . Rather , this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample . The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the Frank free energy density . One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample : ( 1 ) twists of the material , where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another , rather than aligned ; ( 2 ) splay of the material , where bending occurs perpendicular to the director ; and ( 3 ) bend of the material , where the distortion is parallel to the director and molecular axis . All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty . They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container . The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three types of distortions . Elastic continuum theory is a particularly powerful tool for modeling liquid crystal devices and lipid bilayers . 
 = = External influences on liquid crystals = = 
 Scientists and engineers are able to use liquid crystals in a variety of applications because external perturbation can cause significant changes in the macroscopic properties of the liquid crystal system . Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes . The magnitude of the fields , as well as the speed at which the molecules align are important characteristics industry deals with . Special surface treatments can be used in liquid crystal devices to force specific orientations of the director . 
 = = = Electric and magnetic field effects = = = 
 The ability of the director to align along an external field is caused by the electric nature of the molecules . Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge . When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal , the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field .
