 After Laozi and Zhuangzi , the literature of Taoism grew steadily and was compiled in form of a canon — the Daozang — which was published at the behest of the emperor . Throughout Chinese history , Taoism was several times nominated as a state religion . After the 17th century , however , it fell from favor . 
 Today , ancient Taoist thought incorporated into the ancient Chinese religion is one of five religions officially recognized in the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) as well as Taiwan , and although it does not travel readily from its East Asian roots , claims adherents in a number of societies . Taoism also has sizable communities in Hong Kong , Taiwan , Japan and in Southeast Asia .

 English speakers continue to debate the preferred romanization of the words " Daoism " and " Taoism " . The root Chinese word 道 " way , path " is romanized tao in the older Wade – Giles system and dào in the modern Pinyin system . In linguistic terminology , English Taoism / Daoism is formed from the Chinese loanword tao / dao 道 " way ; route ; principle " and the native suffix -ism . The debate over Taoism vs. Daoism involves <unk> , phonemes , loanwords , and politics – not to mention whether Taoism should be pronounced / ˈtaʊ.ɪzəm / or / ˈdaʊ.ɪzəm / . 
 Daoism is pronounced / ˈdaʊ.ɪzəm / , but English speakers disagree whether Taoism should be / ˈdaʊ.ɪzəm / or / ˈtaʊ.ɪzəm / . In theory , both Wade – Giles tao and Pinyin dao are articulated identically , as are Taoism and Daoism . An investment book titled The Tao Jones Averages ( a pun on the Dow Jones Indexes ) illustrates this / <unk> / pronunciation 's widespread familiarity . In speech , Tao and Taoism are often pronounced / <unk> / and ˈtaʊ.ɪzəm / , reading the Chinese unaspirated lenis ( " weak " ) / t / as the English voiceless stop consonant / t / . <unk> shows American and British English differences in pronouncing Taoism . A study of major English dictionaries published in Great Britain and the United States found the most common Taoism glosses were / <unk> / in British sources and / <unk> , <unk> / in American ones . 
 = = = Categorization = = = 
 The word " Taoism " is used to translate different Chinese terms which refer to different aspects of the same tradition and semantic field : 
 " Taoist religion " ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ; lit . " teachings of the Tao " ) , or the " liturgical " aspect — A family of organized religious movements sharing concepts or terminology from " Taoist philosophy " ; the first of these is recognized as the Celestial Masters school . 
 " Taoist philosophy " ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ; lit . " school or family of the Tao " ) or " <unk> " ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ; lit . " learning of the Tao " ) , or the " mystical " aspect — The philosophical doctrines based on the texts of the I Ching , the Tao Te Ching ( or Daodejing , Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) and the Zhuangzi ( Chinese : 莊子 ; pinyin : <unk> ) . These texts were linked together as " Taoist philosophy " during the early Han Dynasty , but notably not before . It is unlikely that Zhuangzi was familiar with the text of the Daodejing , and Zhuangzi would not have identified himself as a Taoist as this classification did not arise until well after his death . 
 However , the discussed distinction is rejected by the majority of Western and Japanese scholars . It is contested by hermeneutic ( interpretive ) difficulties in the categorization of the different Taoist schools , sects and movements . Taoism does not fall under an umbrella or a definition of a single organized religion like the Abrahamic traditions ; nor can it be studied as a mere variant of Chinese folk religion , as although the two share some similar concepts , much of Chinese folk religion is separate from the tenets and core teachings of Taoism . Sinologists Isabelle Robinet and Livia Kohn agree that " Taoism has never been a unified religion , and has constantly consisted of a combination of teachings based on a variety of original revelations . " 
 Chung @-@ ying Cheng , a Chinese philosopher , views Taoism as a religion that has been embedded into Chinese history and tradition . " Whether Confucianism , Daoism , or later Chinese Buddhism , they all fall into this pattern of thinking and organizing and in this sense remain religious , even though individually and intellectually they also assume forms of philosophy and practical wisdom . " Chung @-@ ying Cheng also noted that the Daoist view of heaven flows mainly from " observation and meditation , [ though ] the teaching of the way ( dao ) can also include the way of heaven independently of human nature " . In Chinese history , the three religions of Buddhism , Daoism and Confucianism stand on their own independent views , and yet are " involved in a process of attempting to find harmonization and convergence among themselves , so that we can speak of a ' unity of three religious teaching ' ( <unk> <unk> ) " . 
 = = = The term " Taoist " = = = 
 Traditionally , the Chinese language does not have terms defining lay people adhering to the doctrines or the practices of Taoism , who fall instead within the field of folk religion . " Taoist " , in the <unk> literature of the 19th and early 20th centuries , was used as a translation of <unk> ( <unk> , " master of the Tao " ) , or " Taoist priest " , that is applied to the ordained clergymen of a Taoist institution who " represent Taoist culture on a professional basis " , are experts of Taoist liturgy , and therefore can employ this knowledge and ritual skills for the benefit of a community . 
 This role of Taoist priests reflects the definition of Taoism as a " liturgical framework for the development of local cults " , in other words a scheme or structure for the Chinese folk religion , proposed first by Kristofer Schipper in The Taoist Body ( 1986 ) . <unk> traditions are comparable in their role to the non @-@ Taoist <unk> ( <unk> , " ritual masters " ) traditions ( <unk> ) . 
 The term <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; literally : " follower of Taoism " ) , with the meaning of " Taoist " as " lay member or believer of Taoism " , is a modern invention that goes back to the introduction of the Western category of " organized religion " in China in the 20th century , and the creation of the Chinese Taoist Association , but it has little application in the fabric of Chinese society in which Taoism continues to be an " order " of the larger structure of Chinese religion . 
 = = Origins and development = = 
 Laozi is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoism and is closely associated in this context with " original " or " primordial " Taoism . Whether he actually existed is disputed ; however , the work attributed to him – the Tao Te Ching – is dated to the late 4th century BCE . 
 Taoism draws its cosmological foundations from the School of Naturalists ( in the form of its main elements – yin and yang and the Five Phases ) , which developed during the Warring States period ( 4th to 3rd centuries BC ) . 
 Robinet identifies four components in the emergence of Taoism : 
 Philosophical Taoism , i.e. the Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi 
 techniques for achieving ecstasy 
 practices for achieving longevity or immortality 
 exorcism . 
 Some elements of Taoism may be traced to prehistoric folk religions in China that later coalesced into a Taoist tradition . In particular , many Taoist practices drew from the Warring @-@ States @-@ era phenomena of the wu ( connected to the shamanic culture of northern China ) and the <unk> ( which probably derived from the " archivist @-@ soothsayers of antiquity , one of whom supposedly was Laozi himself " ) , even though later Taoists insisted that this was not the case . Both terms were used to designate individuals dedicated to " ... magic , medicine , divination , ... methods of longevity and to ecstatic wanderings " as well as exorcism ; in the case of the wu , " shamans " or " sorcerers " is often used as a translation . The <unk> were philosophically close to the School of Naturalists , and relied much on astrological and calendrical speculations in their divinatory activities . 
 The first organized form of Taoism , the Tianshi ( Celestial Masters ' ) school ( later known as Zhengyi school ) , developed from the Five Pecks of Rice movement at the end of the 2nd century CE ; the latter had been founded by Zhang Daoling , who claimed that Laozi appeared to him in the year 142 . The Tianshi school was officially recognized by ruler Cao Cao in 215 , legitimizing Cao Cao 's rise to power in return . Laozi received imperial recognition as a divinity in the mid @-@ 2nd century BCE . 
 Taoism , in form of the Shangqing school , gained official status in China again during the Tang dynasty ( 618 – 907 ) , whose emperors claimed Laozi as their relative . The Shangqing movement , however , had developed much earlier , in the 4th century , on the basis of a series of revelations by gods and spirits to a certain Yang Xi in the years between 364 and 370 . 
 Between 397 and 402 , Ge Chaofu compiled a series of scriptures which later served as the foundation of the Lingbao school , which unfolded its greatest influence during the Song dynasty ( 960 – 1279 ) . Several Song emperors , most notably Huizong , were active in promoting Taoism , collecting Taoist texts and publishing editions of the Daozang . 
 In the 12th century , the Quanzhen School was founded in Shandong . It flourished during the 13th and 14th century and during the Yuan dynasty became the largest and most important Taoist school in Northern China . The school 's most revered master , Qiu <unk> , met with Genghis Khan in 1222 and was successful in influencing the Khan towards exerting more restraint during his brutal conquests . By the Khan 's decree , the school also was exempt from taxation . 
 Aspects of Confucianism , Taoism , and Buddhism were consciously synthesized in the Neo @-@ Confucian school , which eventually became Imperial orthodoxy for state bureaucratic purposes under the Ming ( 1368 – 1644 ) . 
 The Qing Dynasty ( 1644 – 1912 ) , however , much favored Confucian classics over Taoist works . 
 During the 18th century , the imperial library was constituted , but excluded virtually all Taoist books . By the beginning of the 20th century , Taoism had fallen much from favor ( for example , only one complete copy of the Daozang still remained , at the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing ) . 
 Today , Taoism is one of five religions recognized by the People 's Republic of China . The government regulates its activities through the Chinese Taoist Association . Taoism is freely practiced in Taiwan , where it claims millions of adherents . 
 = = Doctrines = = 
 = = = Ethics = = = 
 Taoism tends to emphasize various themes of the I Ching , the Tao Te Ching and Zhuangzi , such as naturalness , spontaneity , simplicity , detachment from desires , and most important of all , wu wei . However , the concepts of those keystone texts cannot be equated with Taoism as a whole . 
 = = = = Tao and Te = = = = 
 Tao ( Chinese : 道 ; pinyin : dào ) literally means " way " , but can also be interpreted as road , channel , path , doctrine , or line . In Taoism , it is " the One , which is natural , spontaneous , eternal , nameless , and indescribable . It is at once the beginning of all things and the way in which all things pursue their course . " It has variously been denoted as the " flow of the universe " , a " conceptually necessary ontological ground " , or a demonstration of nature . The Tao also is something that individuals can find immanent in themselves . 
 The active expression of Tao is called Te ( also spelled – and pronounced – De , or even Teh ; often translated with Virtue or Power ; Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) , in a sense that Te results from an individual living and cultivating the Tao . 
 = = = = Wu @-@ wei = = = = 
 The ambiguous term wu @-@ wei ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> ) constitutes the leading ethical concept in Taoism . Wei refers to any intentional or deliberated action , while wu carries the meaning of " there is no ... " or " lacking , without " . Common translations are " nonaction " , " effortless action " or " action without intent " . The meaning is sometimes emphasized by using the paradoxical expression " wei wu wei " : " action without action " . 
 In ancient Taoist texts , wu @-@ wei is associated with water through its yielding nature . Taoist philosophy , in accordance with the I Ching , proposes that the universe works harmoniously according to its own ways . When someone exerts their will against the world in a manner that is out of rhythm with the cycles of change , they may disrupt that harmony and unintended consequences may more likely result rather than the willed outcome . Taoism does not identify one 's will as the root problem . Rather , it asserts that one must place their will in harmony with the natural universe . Thus , a potentially harmful interference may be avoided , and in this way , goals can be achieved effortlessly . " By wu @-@ wei , the sage seeks to come into harmony with the great Tao , which itself accomplishes by nonaction . " 
 = = = = Naturalness = = = = 
 Naturalness ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ; Wade – Giles : tzu @-@ jan ; lit . " self @-@ such " ， " self organisation " ) is regarded as a central value in Taoism . It describes the " primordial state " of all things as well as a basic character of the Tao , and is usually associated with spontaneity and creativity . To attain naturalness , one has to identify with the Tao ; this involves freeing oneself from selfishness and desire , and appreciating simplicity . 
 An often cited metaphor for naturalness is pu ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> , <unk> ; Wade – Giles : p 'u ; lit . " uncut wood " ) , the " <unk> block " , which represents the " original nature ... prior to the imprint of culture " of an individual . It is usually referred to as a state one returns to . 
 = = = = Three Treasures = = = = 
 The Taoist Three Treasures or Three Jewels ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) comprise the basic virtues of ci ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> , usually translated as compassion ) , jian ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> , usually translated as moderation ) , and <unk> wei <unk> xian ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , literally " not daring to act as first under the heavens " , but usually translated as humility ) . 
 As the " practical , political side " of Taoist philosophy , Arthur Waley translated them as " abstention from aggressive war and capital punishment " , " absolute simplicity of living " , and " refusal to assert active authority " . 
 The Three Treasures can also refer to jing , qi and shen ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : jīng @-@ qì @-@ <unk> ; jing is usually translated with " essence " and shen with " spirit " ) . These terms are elements of the traditional Chinese concept of the human body , which shares its cosmological foundation - <unk> - with Taoism . Within this framework , they play an important role in <unk> ( " Taoist Inner Alchemy " ) . 
 = = = Cosmology = = = 
 Taoist cosmology is cyclic ; relativity , evolution and ' extremes meet ' are main characters . It shares similar views with the School of Yin Yang which was headed by Zou Yan ( 305 – 240 BCE ) . The school 's tenets harmonized the concepts of the Wu Xing ( Five Phases ) and yin and yang . In this spirit , the universe is seen as being in a constant process of re @-@ creating itself , as everything that exists is a mere aspect of qi , which , " condensed , becomes life ; diluted , it is indefinite potential " . Qi is in a perpetual transformation between its condensed and diluted state . These two different states of qi , on the other hand , are embodiments of the abstract entities of yin and yang , two complementary extremes that constantly play against and with each other and cannot exist without the other . 
 Human beings are seen as a microcosm of the universe , and for example comprise the Wu Xing in form of the <unk> @-@ fu organs . As a consequence , it is believed that deeper understanding of the universe can be achieved by understanding oneself . 
 = = = Theology = = = 
 Taoism is practiced as a religion in various Asian communities , but its theology is not <unk> dependent on the existence of an anthropomorphic godlike figurehead ( even though some communities do worship Laozi as the attributed founder of the philosophical doctrine , as well as other deities from ancient Chinese folklore ) ; on a theological basis , the Taoist religion has more affinities with pantheistic traditions around the world , given its philosophical emphasis on the formlessness of the Tao and the primacy of the " Way " rather than anthropomorphic concepts of " God " . 
 Nevertheless , as Taoist beliefs include teachings based on various sources , and are often intermingled with Chinese folk religious practice , popular Taoist religious sects have co @-@ opted mythical figures from Chinese folklore as well as actual Taoist personages as figures of worship , with the latter better understood as analogous to " saints " in Catholic veneration rather than as divine deities in and of themselves , even though they were also often mythologised to possess superhuman or supernatural powers . Different branches of Taoism often have differing beliefs , especially concerning deities and the proper composition of the pantheon . Nevertheless , there are certain core beliefs that nearly all the sects share . Traditional conceptions of Tao should not be confused with the Western concepts of theism , however . Being one with the Tao does not necessarily indicate a union with an eternal spirit in , for example , the Hindu sense . 
 Popular Taoism typically presents the Jade Emperor as the official head deity . Intellectual ( " elite " ) Taoists , such as the Celestial Masters sect , usually present Laozi ( Laojun , " Lord Lao " ) and the Three Pure Ones at the top of the pantheon of deities . The pantheon tends to mirror the bureaucracy of Imperial China ; deities also may be promoted or demoted for their actions . 
 While a number of immortals or other mysterious figures appear in the Zhuangzi , and to a lesser extent in the Tao Te Ching , these have generally not become the objects of worship . 
 = = Texts = = 
 = = = Tao Te Ching = = = 
 The Tao Te Ching or Daodejing is widely considered the most influential Taoist text . According to legend , it was written by Laozi , and often the book is simply referred to as the " Laozi . " However , authorship , precise date of origin , and even unity of the text are still subject of debate , and will probably never be known with certainty . The earliest texts of the Tao Te Ching that have been excavated ( written on bamboo tablets ) date back to the late 4th century BCE . Throughout the history of religious Taoism , the Tao Te Ching has been used as a ritual text . 
 The famous opening lines of the Tao Te Ching are : 
 <unk> ( pinyin : dào <unk> dào <unk> cháng dào ) 
 " The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao " 
 <unk> ( pinyin : míng <unk> míng <unk> cháng míng ) 
 " The name that can be named is not the eternal name . " 
 There is significant , at times acrimonious debate regarding which English translation of the Tao Te Ching is preferable , and which particular translation methodology is best . The Tao Te Ching is not thematically ordered . However , the main themes of the text are repeatedly expressed using variant formulations , often with only a slight difference . 
 The leading themes revolve around the nature of Tao and how to attain it . Tao is said to be ineffable , and accomplishing great things through small means . Ancient commentaries on the Tao Te Ching are important texts in their own right . Perhaps the oldest one , the <unk> Gong commentary , was most likely written in the 2nd century CE . Other important commentaries include the one from Wang Bi and the Xiang 'er . 
 = = = Zhuangzi = = = 
 The Taoist book Zhuangzi ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : 莊子 ; pinyin : <unk> ) , named after its purported author Zhuangzi , is a composite of writings from various sources , and is considered one of the most important texts in Taoism . The commentator Guo Xiang ( circa 300 AD ) helped establish the text as an important source for Taoist thought . The traditional view is that Zhuangzi himself wrote the first seven chapters ( the " inner chapters " ) and his students and related thinkers were responsible for the other parts ( the " outer " and " miscellaneous " chapters ) . The work uses anecdotes , parables and dialogues to express one of its main themes , that is aligning oneself to the laws of the natural world and " the way " of the elements . 
 = = = I Ching = = = 
 The I Ching , or Yijing , was originally a divination system that had its origins around 1150 B.C. Although it predates the first mentions of Tao as an organised system of philosophy and religious practice , this text later became of philosophical importance to Daoism and Confucianism . 
 The I Ching itself , shorn of its commentaries , consists of 64 combinations of 8 trigrams ( called " hexagrams " ) , traditionally chosen by throwing coins or yarrow sticks , to give the diviner some idea of the situation at hand and , through reading of the " changing lines " , some idea of what is developing . 
 The 64 original notations of the hexagrams in the I Ching can also be read as a meditation on how change occurs , so it assists Taoists with managing yin and yang cycles as Laozi advocated in the Tao Te Ching ( the oldest known version of this text was dated to 400 BC ) . More recently as recorded in the 18th century , the Taoist master Liu <unk> continued to advocate this usage . 
 = = = Daozang = = = 
 The Daozang ( <unk> , Treasury of Tao ) is also referred to as the Taoist canon . It was originally compiled during the Jin , Tang , and Song dynasties . The version surviving today was published during the Ming Dynasty . The Ming Daozang includes almost 1500 texts . Following the example of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka , it is divided into three dong ( <unk> , " caves " , " grottoes " ) . They are arranged from " highest " to " lowest " : 
 The Zhen ( " real " or " truth " <unk> ) grotto . Includes the Shangqing texts . 
 The Xuan ( " mystery " <unk> ) grotto . Includes the Lingbao scriptures . 
 The Shen ( " divine " 神 ) grotto . Includes texts predating the <unk> ( <unk> ) revelations . 
 <unk> generally do not consult published versions of the Daozang , but individually choose , or inherit , texts included in the Daozang . These texts have been passed down for generations from teacher to student . 
 The Shangqing school has a tradition of approaching Taoism through scriptural study . It is believed that by reciting certain texts often enough one will be rewarded with immortality . 
 = = = Other texts = = = 
 While the Tao Te Ching is most famous , there are many other important texts in traditional Taoism . Taishang <unk> Pian ( " Treatise of the Exalted One on Response and Retribution " ) discusses sin and ethics , and has become a popular morality tract in the last few centuries . It asserts that those in harmony with Tao will live long and fruitful lives . The wicked , and their descendants , will suffer and have shortened lives . 
 = = Symbols and images = = 
 The taijitu ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ; commonly known as the " yin and yang symbol " or simply the " yin yang " ) as well as the <unk> <unk> ( " Eight <unk> " ) are associated with Taoist symbolism . The taijitu is not an exclusive symbol of Taoism , however . While almost all Taoist organizations make use of it , one could actually also call it Confucian , Neo @-@ Confucian or pan @-@ Chinese . One is likely to see this symbol as decorations on Taoist organization flags and logos , temple floors , or stitched into clerical robes . According to Song dynasty sources , it originated around the 10th century . Previously , yin and yang were symbolized by a tiger and dragon . 
 Taoist temples may fly square or triangular flags . They typically feature mystical writing or diagrams and are intended to fulfill various functions including providing guidance for the spirits of the dead , to bring good fortune , increase life span , etc . Other flags and banners may be those of the gods or immortals themselves . 
 A zigzag with seven stars is sometimes displayed , representing the Big Dipper ( or the Bushel , the Chinese equivalent ) . In the Shang Dynasty the Big Dipper was considered a deity , while during the Han Dynasty , it was considered a qi path of the circumpolar god , <unk> . 
 Taoist temples in southern China and Taiwan may often be identified by their roofs , which feature dragons and phoenixes made from multi @-@ colored ceramic tiles . They also stand for the harmony of yin and yang ( with the phoenix being yin ) . A related symbol is the flaming pearl which may be seen on such roofs between two dragons , as well as on the hairpin of a Celestial Master . In general though , Chinese Taoist architecture has no universal features that distinguish it from other structures . 
 = = Practices = = 
 = = = Vegetarian diet = = = 
 Taoist diet encourages fasting and vegetarianism . 
 = = = Rituals = = = 
 At certain dates , food may be set out as a sacrifice to the spirits of the deceased or the gods , such as during the Qingming Festival . This may include slaughtered animals , such as pigs and ducks , or fruit . Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of Joss paper , or Hell Bank Notes , on the assumption that images thus consumed by the fire will reappear — not as a mere image , but as the actual item — in the spirit world , making them available for revered ancestors and departed loved ones . At other points , a vegan diet or full fast may be observed . 
 Also on particular holidays , street parades take place . These are lively affairs which invariably involve firecrackers and flower @-@ covered floats broadcasting traditional music . They also variously include lion dances and dragon dances ; human @-@ occupied puppets ( often of the " Seventh Lord " and " Eighth Lord " ) ; tongji ( <unk> " spirit @-@ medium ; shaman " ) who cut their skin with knives ; <unk> , which are <unk> @-@ practicing honor guards in demonic makeup ; and palanquins carrying god @-@ images . The various participants are not considered performers , but rather possessed by the gods and spirits in question . 
 Fortune @-@ telling — including astrology , I Ching , and other forms of divination — has long been considered a traditional Taoist pursuit . <unk> is also widely encountered in some sects . There is an academic and social distinction between martial forms of mediumship ( such as tongji ) and the spirit @-@ writing that is typically practiced through planchette writing . 
 = = = Physical cultivation = = = 
 A recurrent and important element of Taoism are rituals , exercises and substances aiming at aligning oneself spiritually with cosmic forces , at undertaking ecstatic spiritual journeys , or at improving physical health and thereby extending one 's life , ideally to the point of immortality . Enlightened and immortal beings are referred to as xian . 
 A characteristic method aiming for longevity is Taoist alchemy . Already in very early Taoist scriptures - like the Taiping Jing and the <unk> - alchemical formulas for achieving immortality were outlined . 
 A number of martial arts traditions , particularly the ones falling under the category of <unk> ( like T 'ai Chi Ch 'uan , <unk> Zhang and Xing Yi Quan ) embody Taoist principles to a significant extent , and some practitioners consider their art a means of practising Taoism . 
 = = Society = = 
 = = = Adherents = = = 
 The number of Taoists is difficult to estimate , due to a variety of factors including defining Taoism . According to a survey of religion in China in the year 2010 , the number of people practicing some form of Chinese folk religion is near to 950 million ( 70 % of the Chinese ) . Among these , 173 million ( 13 % ) practice some form of Taoist @-@ defined folk faith . Further in detail , 12 million people have passed some formal initiation into Taoism , or adhere exclusively to it . 
 Most Chinese people and many others have been influenced in some way by Taoist tradition . Recently , there have been some efforts to revive the practice of Taoist religion . In 1956 , the Chinese Taoist Association was formed , and received official approval in 1957 . It was disbanded during the Cultural Revolution under Mao , but re @-@ established in 1980 . The headquarters of the Association are at the Baiyun guan , or White Cloud Temple , of the Longmen branch of Quanzhen Taoism . 
 Since 1980 , many Taoist monasteries and temples have been reopened or rebuilt , most of them belonging to the Zhengyi or Quanzhen schools . For these two schools , ordination has been officially allowed again . However , " the Chinese government prefers the celibate model of ... Quanzhen clergy " , while " Zhengyi clergy are often married , and often reside at home . " 
 Taoist literature and art has influenced the cultures of Korea , Japan , and Vietnam . Organized Taoism seems not to have attracted a large non @-@ Chinese following until modern times . In Taiwan 7 @.@ 5 million people ( 33 % of the population ) identify themselves as Taoists . Data collected in 2010 for religious demographics of Hong Kong and Singapore show that , respectively , 14 % and 11 % of the people of these cities identify as Taoists . 
 = = = Art and poetry = = = 
 Throughout Chinese history there have been many examples of art being influenced by Taoist thought . Notable painters influenced by Taoism include Wu Wei , Huang <unk> , Mi Fu , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , Ni Zan , T 'ang Mi , and Wang Tseng @-@ tsu . Taoist arts represents the diverse regions , dialects , and time spans that are commonly associated with Taoism . Ancient Taoist art was commissioned by the aristocracy , however scholars masters and adepts also directly engaged in the art themselves . 
 = = = Political aspects = = = 
 Unlike Confucianism , Taoism favors philosophical anarchism , pluralism and laissez @-@ faire @-@ government . Laozi has been cited as an early example of a proponent of liberalism . On the other hand , politics never have been a main issue in Taoism . 
 = = = Relations with other religions and philosophies = = = 
 Many scholars believe Taoism arose as a <unk> to Confucianism . The philosophical terms Tao and De are indeed shared by both Taoism and Confucianism , and Laozi is traditionally held to have been a teacher of Confucius . Zhuangzi explicitly criticized Confucianist and <unk> tenets in his work . In general , Taoism rejects the Confucianist emphasis on rituals , hierarchical social order , and conventional morality , and favors naturalness , spontaneity , and individualism instead . 
 The entry of Buddhism into China was marked by significant interaction and syncretism with Taoism . Originally seen as a kind of " foreign Taoism " , Buddhism 's scriptures were translated into Chinese using the Taoist vocabulary . Representatives of early Chinese Buddhism , like <unk> and Tao Sheng , knew and were deeply influenced by the Taoist keystone texts . 
 Taoism especially shaped the development of Chan ( Zen ) Buddhism , introducing elements like the concept of naturalness , distrust of scripture and text , and emphasis on embracing " this life " and living in the " every @-@ moment " . 
 Taoism on the other hand also incorporated Buddhist elements during the Tang period , such as monasteries , vegetarianism , prohibition of alcohol , the doctrine of emptiness , and collecting scripture in tripartite organisation . 
 Ideological and political rivals for centuries , Taoism , Confucianism , and Buddhism deeply influenced one another . For example , Wang Bi , one of the most influential philosophical commentators on Laozi ( and Yijing ) , was a Confucian . The three rivals also share some similar values , with all three embracing a humanist philosophy emphasizing moral behavior and human perfection . In time , most Chinese people identified to some extent with all three traditions simultaneously . This became institutionalised when aspects of the three schools were synthesised in the Neo @-@ Confucian school . 
 Some authors have dealt with comparative studies between Taoism and Christianity . This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as <unk> de Groot , among others . The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth has been done by several authors such as Martin Aronson , and Toropov & Hansen ( 2002 ) , who believe that they have parallels that should not be ignored . In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while <unk> Taoism does not . Yet , a number of authors , including Lin Yutang , have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar . The work " Christ the Eternal Tao " by <unk> Damascene provides a study of " The Tao Te Ching " of Lao Tzu , in the light of Christian revelation .

 Njanji <unk> ( Republican Spelling : Njanji <unk> ; Perfected Spelling : Nyanyi Sunyi ; Indonesian for " Songs of Solitude " or " Songs of Silence " ) is a 1937 poetry collection by Amir Hamzah . Written some time after the poet was forced to marry the daughter of the Sultan of Langkat instead of his chosen love in Java , this collection consists of 24 titled poems and pieces of lyrical prose , none of which are dated . First published in the magazine Poedjangga Baroe , the collection has been republished as a stand @-@ alone book several times . 
 Analysis of Nyanyi Sunyi has focused on the theme of God and His relationship to humanity , as well as of aspects of human existence : fate , dissatisfaction , and escape . Literary critics H.B. Jassin and Zuber Usman view the collection as an attempt to address Amir ’ s worldly problems . The collection has been noted as difficult to read owing to its usage of rarely used Malay and Javanese terms and basis in Islamic culture and Malay history . Despite this , Nyanyi Sunyi has been described as freer in its form than traditional Malay poetry , with what poet Chairil Anwar termed " compactly violent , sharp , and yet short " sentences which brought a new style to the Indonesian language . 
 = = Background = = 
 Amir Hamzah ( 1911 – 1946 ) was a Dutch @-@ educated Malay writer of noble descent and devout Muslim . He was well @-@ oriented in traditional Malay literature , with favourites including historical texts such as Hikayat Hang Tuah , Syair Siti Zubaidah , and Hikayat Panca Tanderan . Amir likewise read works of Arabic , Persian , and Hindu literature . As a result , he had an extensive vocabulary . 
 Poet Laurens Koster <unk> considers the poems included in Nyanyi Sunyi as having been written between 1933 and 1937 , while Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw dates the poems to 1936 and 1937 . The time was one of great emotional turmoil for Hamzah , who was required to marry the daughter of the Sultan of Langkat , who had funded his studies in Java . At the time Amir had reportedly fallen in love with a Javanese woman while studying , and was forced to leave her .

 Njanji <unk> consists of twenty @-@ four titled pieces and an untitled quatrain . Indonesian literary documentarian H.B. Jassin classifies eight of the works as lyrical prose , with the remaining thirteen as poems . None of the works in Nyanyi Sunyi ( and indeed none of Amir 's other works ) are dated . At the end of the book is a couplet , reading " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> / <unk> <unk> seni <unk> " , which American poet and translator Burton Raffel translates as " A flower floating in a loose knot of hair / Gave birth to my sorrowful poems " .

 The poems in Nyanyi Sunyi , unlike much of Amir 's earlier work , generally did not follow the traditional pantun and syair format of four lines of four words . Teeuw notes that some , such " Batu Belah " , followed traditional European forms such as the ballad . Others were more free @-@ form , leaning towards prose poetry . 
 Amir 's diction depends heavily on old Malay terms which saw little contemporary use . He also borrows heavily from other Indonesian languages , particularly Javanese and <unk> . The choice of words was influenced by the need for rhythm and metre , as well as symbolism related to particular terms . Ultimately , however , Amir is freer in his language use than traditional poets . Indonesian critic Bakri Siregar writes that the result is " a beautiful wordplay " . 
 Translator John M. Echols writes that the poems are " difficult reading even for Indonesians " , while poet Chairil Anwar described the works as " obscure poetry " which could not be understood by persons without an understanding of Islam and Malay history . Indonesian literary scholar Muhammad Balfas notes that the work also has many allusions to religious texts , both Islamic and Christian . 
 Anwar opined that Amir , through Nyanyi Sunyi , brought a new style to the Indonesian language , with its " compactly violent , sharp , and yet short " sentences . In a 1945 article he wrote ( translation by Raffel ) , " Before Amir ( Hamzah ) one could call the old poetry a destructive force ; but what a bright light he shone on the new language " . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Religion and God are omnipresent throughout the collection , as evidenced from the first poem , " Padamu Jua " . Amir often uses the word " Tuhan " ( " God " ) . However , unlike his earlier poems which used it in a similar manner to " Dewa " ( " Deity " ) , in Nyanyi Sunyi the word is used as understood in Abrahamic religions , such as Amir 's own Islam ; Amir shows influences from Sufism . In some cases , writes Teeuw , Amir treats God almost as a lover , using familiar terms such as " <unk> " ( " you " ) to address Him . However , Amir recognises that he cannot be one with God . Jassin writes that Amir seems aware of his own smallness before God , acting as a puppet for God 's will ; Teeuw notes that Amir recognises that he would not exist if God did not . 
 This is not to say that Amir accepts his lower position in relation to God ; in several cases , Jassin writes , Amir shows a feeling of dissatisfaction over his own lack of power and protests God 's absoluteness . Teeuw likewise notes a sense of dissatisfaction throughout the poems , writing that Amir seems to treat God as an entity that " only toys with humans , allowing them to be pushed aside and erased " . Elsewhere Teeuw writes that Amir questions fate and the need for him to separate from his love . 
 Aside from themes of God and religion , Amir also shows an awareness of his own humanity , recognising his own instincts and drives . Jassin writes that " Amir 's song is the song of a man 's soul " , showing sadness and joy which do not acknowledge class or creed . Teeuw notes a sense of distrust , a feeling that – having once lost his love – there is no reason Amir will not lose his next lover . Indonesian critic Zuber Usman , meanwhile , discusses the theme of love lost in relation to religion , writing that the loss of his Javanese lover led Amir closer to God . 
 Jassin writes that Amir uses " <unk> " ( " silence " ) as a way to address his worldly problems : regarding time , his own identity , God , and love . According to Jassin , by the end of the compilation physical love has drifted towards a spiritual one , with the answers supplied originating from the supernatural . Ultimately , however , Jassin concludes that Amir 's soul has not reached maturity ; he considers the collection 's last poem , " Astana <unk> " , as but a temporary escape . Jassin finds that the theme of religion is likewise meant as an escape from Amir 's worldly sorrows , an opinion echoed by Usman . 
 = = Publication = = 
 Nyanyi Sunyi was first published in the November 1937 issue of Poedjangga Baroe , a literary magazine which Amir had helped establish . It was later published as a standalone book , and by 1949 it had seen its third printing . 
 In 1941 Amir published another collection of poems , entitled Buah Rindu ( " Fruits of Longing " ) , which consisted mostly of his earlier works . Jassin notes that the works in Nyanyi Sunyi appear more developed and mature than those in the later collection . Teeuw notes that the later collection was more explicitly about romantic love , rather than the religious love of Nyanyi Sunyi .

 = Princess Louise , Duchess of Argyll = 
 Princess Louise , Duchess of Argyll , GCVO , GBE , RRC , GCStJ , VA , CI ( Louise Caroline Alberta ; 18 March 1848 – 3 December 1939 ) , was the sixth child and fourth daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert . 
 Her early life was spent moving among the various royal residences in the company of her family . When her father , the Prince Consort , died on 14 December 1861 , the court went into a period of intense mourning , to which Louise was unsympathetic . Louise was an able sculptor and artist , and several of her sculptures remain today . She was also a supporter of the feminist movement , corresponded with Josephine Butler , and visited Elizabeth Garrett . She held that " the subject of Domestic Economy lies at the root of the – highest life of every true woman . " 
 Before her marriage , Louise served as an unofficial secretary to her mother , the Queen ( 1866 – 1871 ) . The question of Louise 's marriage was discussed in the late 1860s . Suitors from the royal houses of Prussia and Denmark were suggested , but Victoria wanted new blood in the family and therefore suggested a high @-@ ranking member of the aristocracy . Despite opposition from members of the royal family , Louise fell in love with John , Marquess of Lorne , the heir to the Duke of Argyll , and Victoria consented to the marriage , which took place on 21 March 1871 . Despite a happy beginning , the two drifted apart , possibly because of their childlessness and the Queen 's constraints on their activities . 
 In 1878 , Lorne was appointed Governor General of Canada . Louise became viceregal consort , but her stay was unhappy as a result of homesickness and dislike of Ottawa . Following Victoria 's death in 1901 , Louise entered the social circle established by her brother , the new king , Edward VII . Louise 's marriage survived thanks to long periods of separation , but the couple reconciled in 1911 , and she was devastated by her husband 's death in 1914 . After the end of the First World War in 1918 , at the age of 70 , she began to retire from public life , undertaking few public duties outside Kensington Palace , where she died at age 91 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Louise was born on 18 March 1848 at Buckingham Palace , London . She was the fourth daughter and sixth child of the reigning British monarch , Queen Victoria , and her husband Prince Albert of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha . As the daughter of the sovereign , Louise was styled Her Royal Highness The Princess Louise from birth . Her birth coincided with revolutions which swept across Europe , prompting the Queen to remark that Louise would turn out to be " something peculiar " . The Queen 's labour with Louise was the first to be aided with chloroform . 
 Albert and Victoria chose the names Louisa Caroline Alberta . Louise was chosen to honour Albert 's mother . Though christened Louisa in Buckingham Palace 's private chapel by John Bird Sumner , the Archbishop of Canterbury , on 13 May 1848 , she was invariably known as Louise throughout her life . Her godparents were Duke Gustav of Mecklenburg @-@ Schwerin ( her paternal great @-@ great @-@ uncle , for whom Prince Albert stood proxy ) ; The Duchess of Saxe @-@ Meiningen ( for whom her great @-@ aunt Queen Adelaide stood proxy ) ; and The Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg @-@ Strelitz ( her first cousin once @-@ removed , for whom the Hereditary Grand Duchess 's mother The Duchess of Cambridge stood proxy ) . During the ceremony , The Duchess of Gloucester , one of the few children of George III who was still alive , forgot where she was , and suddenly got up in the middle of the service and knelt at the Queen 's feet , much to the Queen 's horror . 
 Like her siblings , Louise was brought up with the strict programme of education devised by her father , Prince Albert , and his friend and confidant , Baron Stockmar . The young children were taught practical tasks , such as cooking , farming , household tasks and carpentry . 
 From her early years , Louise was a talented and intelligent child , and her artistic talents were quickly recognised . On his visit to Osborne House in 1863 , Hallam Tennyson , the son of the poet Alfred , Lord Tennyson , remarked that Louise could " draw beautifully " . Because of her royal rank , an artistic career was not considered . However , the Queen first allowed her to attend art school under the tutelage of the sculptor Mary Thornycroft , and later ( 1863 ) allowed her to study at the National Art Training School , South Kensington . Louise also became an able dancer , and Victoria wrote , after a dance , that Louise " danced the sword dance with more verve and accuracy than any of her sisters " . Her wit and intelligence made her a favourite with her father , with her inquisitive nature earning her the nickname " Little Miss Why " from other members of the royal family . 
 = = Death of Prince Albert = = 
 Louise 's father , Prince Albert , died at Windsor on 14 December 1861 . The Queen was devastated , and ordered her household to move from Windsor to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight . The atmosphere of the royal court became gloomy and morbid in the wake of the Prince 's death , and entertainments became dry and dull . Louise quickly became dissatisfied with her mother 's prolonged mourning . For her seventeenth birthday in 1865 , Louise requested the ballroom to be opened for a debutante dance , the like of which had not been performed since Prince Albert 's death . Her request was refused , and her boredom with the mundane routine of travelling between the different royal residences at set times irritated her mother , who considered Louise to be indiscreet and argumentative . 
 The Queen comforted herself by rigidly continuing with Prince Albert 's plans for their children . Princess Alice was married to Prince Louis , the future Grand Duke of Hesse , at Osborne on 1 June 1862 . In 1863 , Edward , the Prince of Wales , married Princess Alexandra of Denmark . The Queen made it a tradition that the eldest unmarried daughter would become her unofficial secretary , a position which Louise filled in 1866 , despite the Queen 's concern that she was indiscreet . 
 Louise , however , proved to be good at the job : Victoria wrote shortly afterwards : " She is ( and who would some years ago have thought it ? ) a clever dear girl with a fine strong character , unselfish and affectionate . " However , when Louise fell in love with her brother Leopold 's tutor , the Reverend Robinson Duckworth ( 14 years her senior ) , between 1866 and 1870 , the Queen reacted by dismissing Duckworth in 1870 . He later became Canon of Westminster Abbey . 
 Louise was bored at court , and by fulfilling her duties , which were little more than minor secretarial tasks , such as writing letters on the Queen 's behalf ; dealing with political correspondence ; and providing the Queen with company , she had more responsibilities . 
 = = Marriage = = 
 = = = Suitors = = = 
 As a daughter of the Queen , Louise was a desirable bride ; more so as she is regarded as the Queen 's most beautiful daughter by both contemporary and modern biographers . However , she was accused by the press , without substantiation , of romantic affairs . This , coupled with her liberalism and feminism , prompted the Queen to find her a husband . The choice had to suit Victoria as well as Louise , and the Queen insisted that her daughter 's husband should live near her , a promise which had also been extracted from the husband of Helena , Louise 's sister . Various suitors were proposed by the leading royal houses of Europe : Princess Alexandra proposed her brother , the Crown Prince of Denmark , but the Queen was strongly opposed to another Danish marriage that could antagonise Prussia . Victoria , Louise 's eldest sister , proposed the tall and rich Prince Albert of Prussia , but Queen Victoria disapproved of another Prussian marriage that would have been unpopular in England . Prince Albert was also reluctant to settle in England as required . William , Prince of Orange was also considered a suitor , but because of his extravagant lifestyle in Paris , where he lived openly with a mistress , the Queen quickly vetoed the idea . 
 Louise viewed marriage to any prince as undesirable , and announced that she wished to marry John Campbell , Marquess of Lorne , heir to the Dukedom of Argyll . No such marriage , between a daughter of a Sovereign and a British subject , had been given official recognition since 1515 , when Charles Brandon , the first Duke of Suffolk , married Mary Tudor . Louise 's brother , the Prince of Wales , was strongly opposed to a marriage with a non @-@ mediatized noble . Furthermore , Lorne 's father , George Campbell , the eighth Duke of Argyll , was an ardent supporter of William Ewart Gladstone , and the Prince of Wales was worried that he would drag the royal family into political disputes . Nevertheless , the opposition was crushed by the Queen , who wrote to the Prince of Wales in 1869 : 
 That which you object to [ that Louise should marry a subject ] I feel certain will be for Louise 's happiness and for the peace and quiet of the family ... Times have changed ; great foreign alliances are looked on as causes of trouble and anxiety , and are of no good . What could be more painful than the position in which our family were placed during the wars with Denmark , and between Prussia and Austria ? ... You may not be aware , as I am , with what dislike the marriages of Princesses of the Royal Family with small German Princes ( German beggars as they most insultingly were called ) ... As to position , I see no difficulty whatever ; Louise remains what she is , and her husband keeps his rank ... only being treated in the family as a relation when we are together ... 
 The Queen averred that Louise 's marriage to a subject would bring " new blood " into the family , while all European princes were related to each other . She was convinced that this would strengthen the royal family morally and physically . 
 = = = Engagement and wedding = = = 
 Louise became engaged to the Marquess of Lorne on 3 October 1870 . Lorne was invited to Balmoral Castle in Scotland , and accompanied Louise , the Lord Chancellor , Lord Hatherley and Queen Victoria 's lady @-@ in @-@ waiting , Jane , Marchioness of Ely on a drive . Later that day , Louise returned and announced to the Queen that Lorne had " spoken of his devotion " to Louise , and she accepted his proposal in the knowledge of the Queen 's approval . The Queen later gave Lady Ely a bracelet to mark the occasion . 
 The Queen found it difficult to let go of her daughter , confiding in her journal that she " felt painfully the thought of losing her " . The new breach in royal tradition caused surprise , especially in Germany , and Queen Victoria wrote to the Queen of Prussia that princes of small impoverished German houses were " very unpopular " in Britain and that Lord Lorne , a " person of distinction at home " with " an independent fortune " was " really no lower in rank than minor German Royalty " . 
 Victoria settled an annuity on Louise shortly before her marriage . The ceremony was conducted at St George 's Chapel at Windsor Castle on 21 March 1871 , and the crowd outside was so large that , for the first time , policemen had to form chain barriers to keep control . Louise wore a wedding veil of Honiton lace that she designed herself , and was escorted into the Chapel by her mother , and her two eldest brothers , the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh . On this occasion , the usually severe black of the Queen 's mourning dress was relieved by the crimson rubies and blues of the Garter star . Following the ceremony , the Queen kissed Louise , and Lorne – now a member of the royal family , but still a subject – kissed the Queen 's hand . 
 The couple then journeyed to Claremont in Surrey for the honeymoon , but the presence of attendants on the journey , and at meal times , made it impossible for them to talk privately . The short four @-@ day visit did not pass without an interruption from the Queen , who was curious about her daughter 's thoughts on married life . Among their wedding gifts was a maplewood desk from Queen Victoria , now at Inveraray Castle . 
 = = Viceregal Consort of Canada = = 
 = = = <unk> arrival = = = 
 In 1878 , British Prime Minister , Benjamin Disraeli , chose Lorne to be Canada 's new Governor General , and he was duly appointed by Queen Victoria . Louise thus became his Viceregal Consort . On 15 November 1878 , the couple left Liverpool and arrived for the inauguration at Halifax on 25 November . 
 Louise became the first royal to take up residence in Rideau Hall , officially the Queen 's royal residence in Ottawa . However , the hall was far from the splendour of British royal residences , and , as each viceregal couple decorated the hall with their own furnishings , and thus took them when they departed , the <unk> found the palace sparse in décor upon their arrival . Louise put her artistic talents to work and hung many of her watercolour and oil paintings around the hall , also installing her sculpted works . Though the news that a daughter of the Queen would be viceregal consort of Canada first saw a " thrill of joy burst upon the Dominion " , it being felt that the Princess would be a strong link between Canadians and their sovereign , the arrival of the new governor general and his wife was not initially welcomed by the Canadian press , which complained about the imposition of royalty on the country 's hitherto un @-@ regal society . 
 Relations with the press further deteriorated when Lorne 's private secretary , Francis de Winton , threw four journalists off the royal train . Although the <unk> had no knowledge of de Winton 's action , it was assumed by the press that they did , and they earned an early reputation for haughtiness . Louise was horrified by the negative press , and when she heard about reports of " a nation of flunkies " at the viceregal court , taking lessons in " the backward walk , " Louise declared that she " wouldn 't care if they came in blanket coats ! " . ( A reference to the ubiquitous capote , a coat made of blanket @-@ cloth , both durable and warm . The cultural significance of the blanket coat in genteel society , with reference to several early Governors @-@ General and their wives , can be found in " ' Very Picturesque and Very Canadian ' : The Blanket Coat and Anglo @-@ Canadian Identity in the Second Half of the Nineteenth Century " by Eileen Stack of the McCord Museum of Canadian History . ) Eventually the worries of a rigid court at Rideau Hall and the " feeble undercurrent of criticism " turned out to be unfounded as the royal couple proved to be more relaxed than their predecessors . 
 = = = Canadian entertainments = = = 
 Louise 's first few months in Canada were tinged with sadness as her favourite sister , The Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine , died on 14 December 1878 . Although homesick over that first Christmas , Louise soon grew accustomed to the winter climate . <unk> and skating were two of her favourite pastimes . In Canada , as the monarch 's direct representative , Lorne always took precedence over his wife , so that at the Opening of the Parliament of Canada on 13 February 1879 , Louise was ranked no differently from others in attendance . She had to remain standing with the MPs , until Lorne asked them to be seated . In order for Lorne to meet every Canadian member of Parliament , he held bi @-@ weekly dinners for 50 people . However , some of the Canadian ladies responded negatively to the British party . One of her ladies @-@ in @-@ waiting reported that some had an " ' I 'm as good as you ' sort of manner when one begins a conversation . " Court entertainments were open ; anyone who could afford the clothing to attend functions was simply asked to sign the visitor 's book . Louise 's first state ball was given on 19 February 1879 , and she made a good impression on her guests when she ordered the silk cordon , separating the viceregal party from the guests , be removed . However , the ball was marred by various mishaps , including a drunken bandsman nearly starting a fire by pulling a curtain over a gas lamp . The open house practice was criticised by guests who complained about the low social status of other guests . One attendee was horrified to find the attendee 's grocer dancing in the same set . 
 Louise and Lorne founded the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts , and enjoyed visiting Quebec ( where they made their summer home ) , and Toronto . Louise served as patroness of the Ladies ' Educational Association , of the Woman 's Protective Immigration Society , of the Society of Decorative Arts and of the Art Association , all of Montreal . One of her works as a sculptor is the statue of her Royal mother Queen Victoria , which now stands in front of the Royal Victoria College , Montreal , now the Strathcona Music Building of McGill University . Lorne 's father , The Duke of Argyll , arrived with two of his daughters in June , and in the presence of the family , Louise caught a 28 @-@ pound ( almost 13 kg ) salmon . The women 's success at fishing prompted the Duke to remark that fishing in Canada required no skill . 
 = = = Sleigh accident = = = 
 Louise , Lorne , and two attendants , were hurt in a sleigh accident on 14 February 1880 . The winter was particularly severe , and the carriage in which they were traveling overturned , throwing the coachman and footman from the sleigh . The horses then panicked , and dragged the overturned carriage over more than 400 yards ( 370 m ) of ground . Louise was knocked unconscious when she hit her head on the iron bar supporting the roof , and Lorne was trapped underneath her , expecting " the sides of the carriage to give way at any moment " . Eventually , as they overtook the sleigh ahead , the horses calmed , and the occupant of that sleigh , Princess Louise 's aide @-@ de @-@ camp , ordered an empty carriage to convey the injured party back to Rideau Hall . 
 The doctors who attended Louise reported she was severely concussed and in shock , and that " it was a wonder her skull was not fractured " . Louise 's ear had been injured when her earring caught on the side of the sleigh , tearing her ear lobe in two . The press played down the story on instructions from Lorne 's private secretary , an act that was described by contemporaries as " stupid and ill advised " . For example , one New Zealand newspaper reported , " Excepting immediately after the blow , the Princess was perfectly sensible during the whole time ... " Knowledge of Louise 's true condition might have elicited sympathy from the Canadian people . As it was , one Member of Parliament wrote : " Except the cut in the lower part of the ear I think there was no injury done worth mentioning . " Therefore , when Louise cancelled her immediate engagements , people thought she was malingering . News of the accident was also played down in Britain , and in letters home to the anxious Queen Victoria . 
 She played a major role in the development of the nascent tourism industry of the colony of Bermuda , 770 miles South @-@ east of Nova Scotia . In 1883 , for reasons of her fragile health , she spent the winter in Bermuda , popularising a trend for wealthy North Americans to escape to Bermuda 's relatively mild climate during the winter months . Her visit brought such attention to Bermuda that a palatial hotel , which opened in 1885 , intended to cater to these new visitors , was named after her ; the Princess Hotel was built on the shore of Hamilton Harbour , in the parish of Pembroke . 
 = = = Continued interest in Canada = = = 
 After returning to Britain in 1883 , Louise continued to take an interest in Canada . During the North @-@ West Rebellion of 1885 she sent a certain Dr. Boyd with medical supplies and a large fund of money for distribution . Her express instructions were that assistance was to be rendered to friend and foe indiscriminately . To fulfill her wishes , Boyd accompanied the Militia Medical Staff , under Dr. Thomas Roddick to the sites of the Battle of Fish Creek and the Battle of Batoche to help give medical treatment to the wounded , including the Métis opposition . 
 In 1905 , the province of Alberta was named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta . In the province , there is Lake Louise , and Mount Alberta is named in her honour .

 Louise returned to Britain , from Quebec , with her husband on 27 October 1883 , and landed at Liverpool . Queen Victoria had prepared apartments at Kensington Palace , and the couple took up official residence there . Louise retained those apartments until her death there 56 years later . Lorne resumed his political career , campaigning unsuccessfully for the Hampstead seat in 1885 . In 1896 , he won the South Manchester seat , entering parliament as a Liberal . Louise , unlike Lorne and his father , was in favour of Irish Home Rule , and disappointed when he defected from Gladstonian Liberalism to the Liberal Unionists . Relations between Louise and Lorne were strained , and , despite the Queen 's attempts to keep them under one roof , they often went their separate ways . Even when he accompanied Louise , he was not always received with favour at court , and the Prince of Wales did not take to him . Out of all the royal family , Lorne was the only one to be identified closely with a political party , having been a Gladstonian liberal in the House of Commons . 
 Louise 's relationship with the two sisters closest to the Queen , Beatrice and Helena , was strained at best . Beatrice had married the tall and handsome Prince Henry of Battenberg in a love match in 1885 , and they had four children . Louise , who had a jealous nature , had grown accustomed to treating Beatrice with pity on account of the Queen 's constant need for her . Beatrice 's biographer , Matthew Dennison , claims that in contrast to Beatrice , Louise remained strikingly good looking throughout her forties . Louise and her husband were no longer close , and rumours spread about Lorne 's alleged homosexuality . Thus , Beatrice was enjoying a satisfying sexual relationship with her popular husband , which Louise was not . Louise may have considered Prince Henry a more appropriate husband for herself . Certainly , following Prince Henry 's death in 1896 , Louise wrote that : " he [ Henry ] was almost the greatest friend I had — I , too , miss him more than I can say " . In addition , Louise attempted to champion her late brother @-@ in @-@ law by announcing that she was his confidante and that Beatrice , a mere cipher , meant nothing to him . 
 = = = Rumours regarding Louise = = = 
 Further rumours spread that Louise was having an affair with Arthur Bigge , later Lord Stamfordham , the Queen 's assistant private secretary . Beatrice mentioned the rumours to the Queen 's physician , calling it a " scandal " , and Prince Henry claimed to have seen Bigge drinking to Louise 's health at dinner . Louise denied the rumour , claiming that it was started by Beatrice and Helena to undermine her position at court . However , on Henry 's death , relations between the sisters sporadically improved , and it was Louise , rather than the Queen , who was the first to arrive at Cimiez to be with the widowed Beatrice . Nevertheless , Louise 's jealousy did not evaporate completely . James Reid , the Queen 's physician , wrote to his wife a few years later : " Louise is as usual much down on her sisters . Hope she won 't stay long or she will do mischief ! " 
 Rumours of affairs did not surround only Bigge . In 1890 , the sculptor Joseph Edgar Boehm died in Louise 's presence at his studio in London , leading to rumours that the two were having an affair . Boehm 's assistant , Alfred Gilbert , who played a central role in comforting Louise after Boehm 's death , and supervised the destruction of Boehm 's private papers , was rapidly promoted as a royal sculptor . Louise was also romantically linked to fellow artist Edwin Lutyens ; her equerry , Colonel William Probert ; and an unnamed music master . However , Jehanne Wake , Louise 's biographer , argues that there is no substantial evidence to suggest that Louise had sexual relationships with anyone other than her husband . 
 During Victoria 's last years , Louise carried out a range of public duties , such as opening public buildings , laying foundation stones , and officiating at special programmes . Louise , like her eldest sister Victoria , was more liberally minded , and supported the suffragist movement , completely contrary to the Queen 's views . Louise privately visited Britain 's first female doctor , Elizabeth Garrett . Queen Victoria deplored the idea of women joining professions , especially the medical profession , and described the training of female doctors as a " repulsive subject " . 
 = = = Louise as unconventional royal = = = 
 Louise was determined to be seen as an ordinary person and not as a member of the court . When travelling abroad , she often used the alias " Mrs Campbell " . Louise was known for her charity towards servants . On one occasion , the butler approached her and requested permission to dismiss the second footman , who was late getting out of bed . When she advised that the footman be given an alarm clock , the butler informed her that he already had one . She then went so far as to suggest a bed that would throw him out at a specified time , but she was told this was not feasible . Finally , she suggested that he might be ill , and when checked , he was found to be suffering from tuberculosis . The footman was therefore sent to New Zealand to recover . 
 On another occasion , when she visited Bermuda , she was invited to a reception and chose to walk rather than be driven . She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house , where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy for a glass of water . Owing to the scarcity of water , the woman had to go some distance to obtain it , but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing . When Louise offered to continue the ironing , the woman refused , adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise . Realising that she had not been recognised , Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again . When the woman said that she would have thought so , but was admittedly unsure , Louise replied : " Well take a good look at me now , so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges . " The Princess clung to her privacy , and enjoyed not being recognised . 
 Louise and her sisters had another disagreement after the death of the Queen 's close friend , Jane Spencer , Baroness Churchill . Determined not to put her mother through more misery , Louise wanted the news to be broken to the Queen gradually . When this was not done , Louise voiced her sharp criticism of Helena and Beatrice . One month later , on 22 January 1901 , Queen Victoria died at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight . In her will , the Queen bequeathed Kent House , on the Osborne Estate , to Louise as a country residence , and gave Osborne Cottage to Louise 's youngest sister , Beatrice . Louise and Beatrice were now neighbours both at Kensington Palace and Osborne .

 Upon Queen Victoria 's death , Louise entered the social circle of her brother , the new King Edward VII , with whom she had much in common , including smoking . She had an obsession with physical fitness , and if she was sneered at for this , she would retort by saying : " Never mind , I 'll outlive you all . " Meanwhile , Louise 's husband , 9th Duke of Argyll since 1900 , took his seat in the House of Lords . The Colonial Secretary , Joseph Chamberlain , offered him the office of Governor @-@ General of Australia that year , but the offer was declined . Louise continued her sculpture , and in 1902 , designed a memorial to the colonial soldiers who died in the Boer War . In the same year , she began a nude study on a married woman suggested by the English painter Sir William Blake Richmond . 
 Louise spent much of her time at Kent House , and she frequently visited Scotland with her husband . Financial pressures did not disappear when Lorne became Duke , and Louise avoided inviting the King to Inveraray , Argyll 's ancestral home , because the couple were economising . When Queen Victoria had visited the house before Lorne became Duke of Argyll , there were seventy servants and seventy @-@ four dogs . By the time of Edward VII 's accession , there were four servants and two dogs . 
 The Duke of Argyll 's health continued to deteriorate . He became increasingly senile , and Louise nursed him devotedly from 1911 . In these years Louise and her husband were closer than they had been before . In spring 1914 Louise stayed at Kensington Palace while her husband remained on the Isle of Wight . 
 He developed bronchial problems followed by double pneumonia . Louise was summoned on 28 April 1914 , and he died on 2 May . Following his death , Louise had a nervous breakdown and suffered from intense loneliness , writing to a friend shortly afterwards : " My loneliness without the Duke is quite terrible . I wonder what he does now ! " 
 = = = Last years = = = 
 Louise spent her last years at Kensington Palace , occupying rooms next to her sister Princess Beatrice . She made occasional public appearances with the royal family , such as at the Cenotaph at Whitehall on 11 November 1925 . However , her health deteriorated . In 1935 , she greeted her nephew , King George V , and his wife , Queen Mary , at Kensington Town Hall during their Silver Jubilee celebrations , and was made an Honorary Freeman of the Borough of Kensington . Her last public appearance occurred in 1937 , at the Home Arts and Industries Exhibition . Between these occasions , her great nephew , King Edward VIII , abdicated on 11 December 1936 . In December 1936 , Louise wrote to the British prime minister , Stanley Baldwin , sympathising with him about the crisis . 
 Following the accession of Edward 's brother King George VI , she became too ill to move around , and was confined to Kensington Palace , affectionately called the " Auntie Palace " by Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret . She developed neuritis in her arm , inflammation of the nerves between the ribs , fainting fits , and sciatica . Louise occupied herself by drafting prayers , one of which was sent to Neville Chamberlain , reading " Guide our Ministers of State and all who are in authority over us ... "

 She died at Kensington Palace on the morning of 3 December 1939 at the age of 91 years , 8 months and 15 days , the same age to the day as her younger brother Prince Arthur , wearing the wedding veil she had worn almost 70 years earlier . Following a simple funeral , owing to the war , her remains were cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 8 December . Her ashes were quietly placed in the Royal Crypt at St. George 's Chapel on 12 December , with many members of the Royal and Argyll families present . Her ashes were moved to the Royal Burial Ground , Frogmore near Windsor , on 13 March 1940 . Louise 's will stated that if she died in Scotland she should be buried at the Campbell mausoleum in Kilmun next to her husband ; if in England , at Frogmore near her parents . Her coffin was borne by eight NCOs of her own regiment , The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders .

 Louise bestowed her name on four Canadian regiments : The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada ( Princess Louise 's ) in Hamilton , Ontario ; the Princess Louise Dragoon Guards in Ottawa , Ontario ( inactive since 1965 ) ; the 8th Canadian Hussars ( Princess Louise 's ) in Moncton , New Brunswick ; and the Princess Louise Fusiliers in Halifax , Nova Scotia . 
 Queen Elizabeth II later recalled that Louise and her sister Beatrice would talk until they stunned their audience with their output of words . 
 The province of Alberta in Canada is named after her . Although the name " Louise " was originally planned , the Princess wished to honour her dead father , so her last name was chosen . Lake Louise in Alberta is also named after her , as is Mount Alberta . Although her time in Canada was not always happy , she liked the Canadian people and retained close links with her Canadian regiments . Back at home , she gained a reputation for paying unscheduled visits to hospitals , especially during her later years . Her relationship with her family was generally close . Although at times she bickered with the Queen , and her sisters Helena and Beatrice , the relations did not remain strained for long . She retained a lifelong correspondence with her brother , Prince Arthur , and was one of King Edward VII 's favourite sisters . Of all her siblings , she was closest to Prince Leopold , later Duke of Albany , and she was devastated by his death in 1884 . 
 Among the younger generations of the family , Louise 's favourite relatives were the Duke and Duchess of Kent . At the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937 , Louise lent the Duchess the train that she designed and wore for the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in 1902 . 
 A war hospital in Erskine , Scotland , is named after Louise . It took her name as she was the first patron of the unit . It was originally called Princess Louise Scottish Hospital for Limbless Sailors and Soldiers . The name changed over the years to Erskine Hospital and then just Erskine . The charity is close to its centenary year and has grown to become the biggest ex @-@ service establishment in the country . 
 = = = Art Practice = = = 
 Louise had artistic training from childhood , first with Susan Durant from 1864 , then Mary Thornycroft from 1867 , and further lessons with Edgar Boehm . She also then attended National Art Training School , or NATS , which marks the first time a member of the British royal family attended a public education institution . Like many women artists in the nineteenth century , Louise had to make do with training intended for industrial designers and art teachers rather than fine artists . There was no training from the nude model , as there was for male art students . 
 Louise held an account with the London artists ’ <unk> Charles Roberson & Co. from April 1872 until February 1931 , buying materials for oil and water colour painting including numerous sketchbooks . 
 Louise was the most artistically talented of Queen Victoria 's daughters . As well as being an able actress , pianist and dancer , she was a prolific artist and sculptor . When Louise sculpted a statue of the Queen , portraying her in Coronation robes , the press claimed that her tutor , Sir Edgar Boehm , was the true creator of the work . The claim was denied by Louise 's friends , who asserted her effort and independence . The work was intended to be exhibited in 1887 , but production was delayed until 1893 . A memorial to her brother @-@ in @-@ law , Prince Henry of Battenberg , and a memorial to the Colonial soldiers who fell during the Boer War , reside at Whippingham Church on the Isle of Wight , and another statue of Queen Victoria remains at McGill University in Montreal .

 = Sinsinawa Mound raid = 
 The Sinsinawa Mound raid occurred on June 29 , 1832 , near the Sinsinawa mining settlement in Michigan Territory ( present @-@ day Grant County , Wisconsin in the United States ) . This incident , part of the Black Hawk War , resulted in the deaths of two men ; a third man survived by seeking cover in a nearby blockhouse . In the aftermath of the raid , Captain James W. Stephenson set out to pursue the attackers — a straggling band of Sauk Native Americans — but lost their trail at the Mississippi River . The attack occurred in the same week as other skirmishes and raids , and as a result helped contribute to the growing fear in the region . The raid caused the residents of nearby Platteville to consider fleeing their settlement . 
 = = Background = = 
 As a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the governor of Indiana Territory and a group of Sauk and Fox leaders regarding land settlement , the tribes vacated their lands in Illinois and moved west of the Mississippi in 1828 . However , Sauk Chief Black Hawk and others disputed the treaty , claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted , nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands . Angered by the loss of his birthplace , between 1830 – 31 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the Mississippi River into Illinois , but was persuaded each time to return west without bloodshed . In April 1832 , encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the British , he again moved his so @-@ called " British Band " of around 1 @,@ 000 warriors and non @-@ combatants into Illinois . Finding no allies , he attempted to return across the Mississippi ( to present @-@ day Iowa ) , but the undisciplined Illinois Militia 's actions led to the Battle of Stillman 's Run . A number of other engagements followed , and the militia of Michigan Territory and the state of Illinois were mobilized to hunt down Black Hawk 's band . The conflict became known as the Black Hawk War . 
 The period between Stillman 's Run and the raid at Sinsinawa Mound was filled with war @-@ related activity . A series of attacks at Buffalo Grove , the Plum River settlement , Fort Blue Mounds and the war 's most famous incident , the Indian Creek massacre , all took place between mid @-@ May and late June 1832 . The week before the Battle of Apple River Fort ( on June 24 ) was an important turning point for the settlers : between June 16 and 18 two key battles , one at Waddams Grove and the other at Horseshoe Bend , played a role in changing public perception about the militia after its defeat at Stillman 's Run . The Battle of Apple River Fort occurred five days before the Sinsinawa Mound raid ; the fight was a 45 minute gun battle between defenders garrisoned inside Apple River Fort and Sauk and Fox warriors led by Chief Black Hawk himself . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 George W. Jones , who would later become a U.S. Senator from Iowa , arrived in the Sinsinawa Mound area in 1827 , and in 1828 established a mining settlement there . The first structure at the settlement was Jones 's own log cabin , built during the spring of 1828 in two days . The cabin measured 49 feet ( 14 @.@ 9 m ) by 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) and each room had one door and one window . When the Black Hawk War began four years later he also built a small fort at the site . The remains of the fort , one of many constructed in the region to protect local residents , are said to still stand at the entrance to the Sinsinawa Dominican complex . One of the men who assisted Jones in building the fort 's blockhouse was Enoch Robinson , a soldier who later helped bury the victims of the Sinsinawa Mound raid . At the time of the attack Jones was with Henry Dodge 's militia volunteers , on the way to meet overall commander General Henry Atkinson at Lake Koshkonong , then a marsh region . 
 = = Attack = = 
 On June 29 , 1832 , what was probably a small band of Sauk attacked three men working in a cornfield at the Jones mining settlement near Sinsinawa Mound . The Sauk took up a position directly between the settlers and their weapons . Two of the men — James Boxley and John Thompson — were killed by the raiding party ; their badly mutilated bodies were later recovered . The third , an unidentified man , made a run for Jones blockhouse and survived the attack . The raiders were most likely a group of stragglers from the main body of the British Band , which was moving toward the Rock River with Chief Black Hawk . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 When news of the raid reached Galena , Illinois , Captain James W. Stephenson set out with thirty soldiers to pursue the raiding party . Arriving at Sinsinawa Mound , they buried the two " most shockingly mutilated " settlers there ; both Thompson and Boxley had been scalped and Thompson 's heart had been removed . Stephenson then followed the Sauk trail to the Mississippi River where it went cold , the raiders having apparently crossed the river . Stephenson 's party returned to Galena empty handed . Henry Dodge ordered the various elements of the militia to rendezvous at Fort Hamilton to eventually join General Henry Atkinson near present @-@ day Madison , Wisconsin . When word of the attack at Sinsinawa Mound reached George W. Jones he left the volunteers under the command of Dodge and returned to the settlement at the mound . 
 The attack at Sinsinawa Mound , compounded by other incidents around the region , helped contribute to the fear gripping the settlers . The people of Platteville , in present @-@ day Wisconsin , contemplated fleeing to Galena , about 25 miles ( 40 km ) south , as a direct result of the Sinsinawa Mound raid . Colonel Dodge dispatched one of his men , Frederick Hollman , to Platteville to reassure its nervous residents . However , by the time Hollman arrived the settlers had already been informed that the local Native American Ho @-@ Chunk tribesmen were friendly . This and the subsequent delivery of promised supplies from Galena further placated Platteville 's residents , and the threatened exodus was called off . 
 = Thomas Brunner = 
 Thomas Brunner ( April 1821 – 22 April 1874 ) was an English @-@ born surveyor and explorer remembered for his exploration of the West Coast of New Zealand 's South Island . 
 Brunner was born in April 1821 in Oxford . When he was fifteen , he began to learn architecture and surveying . In 1841 , he joined the New Zealand Company in its venture to establish a settlement in the north of the South Island of New Zealand , to be called Nelson . As well as working as an apprentice surveyor and laying sections and roads for the new settlement , he explored the interior , seeking pastoral land for a growing colony . In 1846 he undertook extensive journeys with Charles Heaphy and a Māori named Kehu towards and along the West Coast . 
 In December 1846 , Brunner commenced an expedition , accompanied by four Māori including Kehu , which began from Nelson . The party travelled down the Buller River and along the West Coast reaching as far south as <unk> Head , near <unk> before returning to Nelson via the Arahura River . This arduous journey , which at one stage saw one of his legs paralysed , took him 550 days . He received honours from the Royal Geographical Society and the Société de géographie ( French Geographic Society ) . He continued to work as a surveyor and in 1851 was appointed Government Surveyor . He surveyed the sites , which he and Heaphy had scouted on previous explorations , for what would become the towns of Westport and Greymouth . He retired in 1869 and died of a stroke on 22 April 1874 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Thomas Brunner was born in Oxford , England , in April 1821 , and baptised four months later on 22 August . He was the oldest son of William Brunner , an Oxford attorney who was also the county coroner . He was of Swiss descent , his father 's parents having emigrated to England at the time of the French Revolution . The Brunner family were active in the Oxford community , Thomas ' parents raising him and his siblings to appreciate cultural and charitable activities . In 1836 , at the age of fifteen , Brunner was apprenticed to an architect , Thomas <unk> , to learn architecture and surveying . Over the next five years , he became proficient in both skills . 
 = = Service with the New Zealand Company = = 
 In 1841 , Brunner 's father put his son 's name forward to the New Zealand Company , which was seeking prospective emigrants for its proposed settlement in the South Island of New Zealand . The company wanted to populate its new settlement with well educated young men of excellent character and with leadership potential . Furthermore , apprentice surveyors , at the time known as " improvers " , were in particular demand and Brunner , aided by character references from his employer and other notable residents of Oxford , was duly selected to join the company . In addition to his work as an improver , he was to assist the settlement 's principal surveyor , Frederick Tuckett . 
 Brunner joined a party of six other young improvers which left England on 27 April 1841 aboard the Whitby . During the voyage to New Zealand , the improvers received further instruction and were tested by having to prepare draft layouts for the new settlement , Brunner 's plan being the best of these . On 18 September , the Whitby arrived at Port Nicholson , the New Zealand Company 's first settlement . The approximate site for the new settlement had yet to be finalised ; initially intended for Banks Peninsula , this location was vetoed by the Governor of New Zealand , William Hobson . Instead , it was to be located at the top of the South Island , at Tasman Bay . Early the following month a convoy of the company 's ships , with Brunner aboard one them , crossed the Cook Strait to Tasman Bay . After scouting the area for three weeks , a site adjacent a deep and sheltered natural harbour was identified as being suitable for the settlement . 
 For the next two years Brunner assisted in the laying out of the settlement , which was to be called Nelson . A drawback with the Nelson settlement was its lack of pasture and the colony began to appropriate more and more of the nearby Wairau Plain , much to the displeasure of local Māori . Several personnel of the company , including Arthur Wakefield , the senior official of the company in Nelson , were killed in the Wairau Affray in June 1843 . The New Zealand Company was forced to look south for more farming land . Brunner was sent to scout the Motueka Valley but failed to penetrate far due to poor weather . From local Māori he heard of a large plain to the south and passed on his findings to Tuckett . In August 1843 , Tuckett dispatched Brunner to confirm the reports . Brunner , accompanied by Kehu , a Māori he had befriended , was again defeated by poor weather . 
 Life in Nelson was hard for the colonists . The company had limited finances and tightened its expenditure which affected the salaries of its employees . In 1844 , it had to halt its operations for a time . Although Nelson had 300 landowners , nearly two thirds were absentee owners and only 80 actually lived in the town . Brunner lived at <unk> , a nearby village , and , in addition to carrying out survey work along the Motueka River , helped in the design and building of houses in the area . He ended his service with the company in August 1844 . 
 = = Exploring the West Coast = = 
 In February 1846 , Brunner and Kehu , accompanied by Charles Heaphy and William Fox , undertook an expedition southwest of Nelson . Fox was the resident agent for the New Zealand Company in Nelson and provided the equipment and provisions for the party in addition to paying a salary to Brunner and Heaphy . Land in Nelson for farming was still scarce but it was hoped that beyond the steep hills to the southwest , good pastoral land would be found . Difficult terrain faced them ; high mountain ranges topped with snow and ice , steep bush , numerous rivers and gorges . Food sources included roots and berries ; birds could be snared and eels caught from streams . Along the coast , shellfish and gull eggs added to the diet . 
 The party , each carrying a load of 75 pounds ( 34 kg ) , trekked to Lake Rotoiti and then climbed the high ranges that backed onto the lake . On 11 February , they saw Lake <unk> and made their way to its shores and spent two days exploring the area . They gained the Buller River on 18 February and walked its banks as far as the <unk> River . Here , believing themselves to be only 20 miles from the coast , dwindling provisions prevented them proceeding to the mouth of the Buller River . Guided by Kehu , the party traversed the Hope Saddle on their way back to Nelson , which they reached on 1 March . 
 Brunner was keen for further exploration and Fox persuaded him to scout along the West Coast to the mouth of the Buller River in the hope of finding suitable land for farming . Brunner , Kehu and Heaphy left Nelson on 17 March on what became a five @-@ month expedition tracing the western coast of South Island as far south as what is now known as Hokitika . Their journey began from Golden Bay , and they made their way to West Wanganui where Brunner hired a local Māori , Etau , as a porter for the party . The expedition hit a snag when the local chief barred their journey south but Brunner and Heaphy mollified him with some tobacco . They continued along the coast , climbing sometimes steep cliffs and fording rivers as they went . Their movements would be held up at times due to rain and high tides . At night , they would shelter in small caves augmented with a screen of Nikau palm leaves . They crossed the <unk> River on 20 April and reached the Buller River ten days later . This had to be crossed using an old canoe that was repaired by Kehu and Etau . After safely getting across , they stayed at the local pā ( village ) . In early May , they sighted the Southern Alps . At the Arahura River ( a tributary of the Grey River ) , the southernmost point of the expedition , they were hosted by the local Ngāi Tahu tribe at Taramakau Pā . Poor weather plagued their return trip back along the coast but they reached Nelson on 18 August . 
 = = = The Great Journey = = = 
 On 3 December 1846 , Brunner began what became his longest and most arduous expedition . He planned to follow the Buller River to the sea and then trek down the West Coast as far south as Milford Sound . During his previous expedition , he had been told of the existence of a route through the Southern Alps by the Māori at the Arahura River . He hoped to discover this route and use it to cross the Southern Alps and reach Canterbury . He was accompanied once again by Kehu , who brought along his wife . Another Māori , Pitewate , a friend of Kehu 's , also joined the venture , accompanied by his wife . Brunner provided clothing and shoes for his companions . The wives proved problematic during the journey as they quarrelled , sometimes supported by their husbands , and Brunner would have to mediate . 
 Stocked with provisions that included two guns , 16 pounds ( 7 kg ) of tobacco , 112 pounds ( 51 kg ) of flour , salt and pepper , biscuits and tea , the party travelled by mules and canoe for the first two weeks until they reached Buller River . They then followed the path of the river down to the coast . The journey was difficult ; the party was constantly bothered by <unk> and rain and they had to ford the river several times . They settled into a routine of trekking for a week then camping for the same period to restock their provisions , living off freshwater fish and <unk> and fern @-@ tree roots . By May 1847 , they were at the final reaches of the Buller but food was becoming so scarce to find , they had to kill Brunner 's dog . He noted its flesh was " ... something between mutton and pork . It is too richly flavoured to eat by itself . " This incident led to him being nicknamed Kai Kuri ( dog eater ) . 
 Brunner was disappointed at the condition of the land along the banks of the Buller River as it neared the coast . He had briefly scouted the area on his previous journey and believed it had potential for pastoral farming . He now found it too damp and mossy to be cultivated . The party reached the mouth of the Buller on 1 June and made their way to the pā that Brunner and Heaphy had stayed at on their last journey but on arrival , found that it had been abandoned . They continued on down to the Arahura River and reached the Taramakau Pā where they stayed for three months over the worst of the winter months . On 12 October , Brunner continued south with some local Māori . He went as far south as <unk> Head , near <unk> where in December he severely sprained his ankle . After recovering , he decided to make his way back to Taramakau Pā . From here he along with his companions , journeyed up the Arahura River and in late January 1848 , discovered the coalfield and lake which now bears his name . He wanted to continue on this route to Canterbury but Kehu and Pitewate would have none of it . The party began to make their way back to Nelson . 
 They travelled north via a tributary of the Arahura River which eventually met the Buller River , which they reached in March . In April , while making his way up the Buller Gorge , Brunner suffered paralysis of his leg . The party had to lay up for a week for Brunner to recover some use of his body . With the aid of Kehu ( Pitewate and his wife abandoned the party when Brunner became ill ) , he was able to reach Nelson in June 1848 , thus ending after 550 days what he described as his ' Great Journey ' . 
 In Nelson , many people had thought Brunner dead and he readily recognised that he would not have survived his endeavours without the aid of Kehu , writing : " ... I found my native <unk> of much use - invaluable indeed , but the other three rather an encumbrance - I could have made better progress without them ; but to <unk> I owe my life - he is a faithful and attached servant . " As well as further information about the West Coast , Brunner informed the colony that coal was to be found in the Grey River valley . However , he also considered , mistakenly , that " there is nothing on the West Coast worth incurring the expense of exploring . " 
 Reports of Brunner 's endeavours on the West Coast soon spread to Wellington and England . He wrote an account of his journey which was first published by Charles Elliott , the editor of the local newspaper the Nelson Examiner , and later , in 1850 , in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society . The Royal Geographical Society also awarded him their Patron 's Medal and appointed him a Fellow of the Society . His exploits were also recognised in France , the Société de géographie ( French Geographic Society ) awarding him a diploma in 1852 . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Brunner 's constitution was considerably impaired by his exertions and his health never fully returned . Despite this , after a period of recovery he set out in November 1848 with three companions , including Kehu , to discover a quicker route between Nelson and Wairau . This involved travelling the paths of the <unk> and Wairoa Rivers to their headwaters . The weather was poor throughout the six @-@ week trip and Brunner was in discomfort for much of the ultimately unsuccessful venture , which determined that the existing route to Wairau was the fastest . 
 Apart from a short period doing contract surveying for the New Zealand Company in March 1849 , Brunner remained unemployed and wrote numerous letters to his contacts . His former travelling companion , William Fox , and Dillon Bell , chief agent of the New Zealand Company , also sought to find him a job and through them , he was able to find work as a clerk with the Canterbury Association between September 1849 and February 1850 . He returned to Nelson in May 1850 and secured full @-@ time employment as a surveyor with the New Zealand Company , but with the proviso that he would be able to take on private work which did not interfere with his duties . To supplement his income Brunner began to take on architectural commissions . 
 In 1851 , the New Zealand Company was still struggling financially and eventually transferred its land to the New Zealand Government . Brunner 's employment with the company ceased and he , after writing a letter soliciting for surveying work , was appointed the Government Surveyor with an annual salary of ₤ 100 ( 2014 approximation ₤ 8 @,@ 000 ) . This was still a low salary for a professional and Brunner was allowed to continue with his architectural commissions , working from an office he had purchased in Nelson . He was kept busy for the next several years ; in addition to carrying out and supervising survey work in the area , he took on responsibility for some public works . He drew up plans for roading , bridges and botanical gardens . 
 On 11 October 1855 , Brunner married Jane Robson , the 26 @-@ year @-@ old daughter of a labourer who had brought his family to New Zealand the previous year . It was a respectable match for Jane as Brunner was considered a particularly eligible bachelor in Nelson , one of around 45 professionals working in the town of about 1600 people . His salary had increased to ₤ 300 ( ₤ 24 @,@ 000 ) and he was now Chief Surveyor for the Nelson Province , the local returning officer and the Commissioner of Native Reserves for Nelson . He also owned three properties , including his Nelson office . 
 Brunner returned to the mouth of the Buller River in March 1861 but this time aboard a ship . Working in much greater comfort than on his last visit to the area in 1848 , with other members of his staff he surveyed and laid out sections for what would become the town of Westport . Later that month he did the same for Greymouth . The work was soon completed and the party returned to Nelson in April 1861 . 
 Brunner designed St Michael 's Church in Waimea West in 1866 , which was probably New Zealand 's first memorial church . It commemorates Captain Francis H. Blundell , an early settler who died in 1865 and is buried here . The previous church on the site from 1843 was the first church in the Nelson Province . On 5 April 1984 , St Michael 's was registered with the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I structure with registration number 248 . 
 = = Retirement and death = = 
 Brunner retired in 1869 at the relatively young age of 46 . He remained employed by the Nelson Provincial Council as a consultant surveyor and was also head of the Nelson Survey Department . His administration skills were not up to the latter role and many of the surveys produced under his supervision were of poor quality . He also continued to seek private work and contributed to a report on the suitability of the Buller region for settlement and this was published in early 1873 . On his retirement in 1869 he had retained his offices of sheriff , returning officer and registration officer but was relieved of these in 1872 in cost @-@ cutting measures by the Nelson Provincial Council . This did not meet with the approval of locals . 
 In late 1873 , Brunner suffered a paralysis of his left side which prevented him from working . By mid @-@ April 1874 , he had sufficiently recovered to begin soliciting the provincial government for suitable employment . However , on the morning of 22 April he suffered a stroke and died few hours later . His funeral service was held at Nelson Cathedral and was attended by several hundred people . A large Māori contingent , including his long @-@ time friend Kehu , was also present . Brunner was buried at <unk> Cemetery . He was survived by his wife , who moved to England soon after his death . She lived with her brother until her death in 1895 . The couple had no children . 
 Several geographic features are named for him . Brunner , originally called <unk> , is a small settlement on the Grey River inland from Greymouth where he first found coal . It is the site of the former Brunner Mine , best known for New Zealand 's worst mine disaster in 1896 . Lake Brunner is located some 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) by road from here , upstream along the Arnold River ; Brunner went there after his coal discovery . Another feature named for him is the Brunner Range , which is located east of the valley through which the <unk> River flows . A plaque to his memory lies in the Nelson Cathedral . 
 = Opeth = 
 Opeth is a Swedish heavy metal band from Stockholm , formed in 1990 . The group has been through several personnel changes , but singer , guitarist and songwriter Mikael Åkerfeldt has remained Opeth 's only founding member and primary driving force throughout the years . Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive , folk , blues , classical and jazz influences into their usually lengthy compositions , as well as strong influences from death metal , especially in their early works . Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts , as well as both death growls and clean vocals . Opeth is also well @-@ known for their incorporation of Mellotrons in their work . Opeth rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums ; but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of Blackwater Park , they have led several major world tours . 
 Opeth has released eleven studio albums , three live DVDs , three live albums ( two that are in conjunction with DVDs ) , and two boxsets . The band released its debut album Orchid in 1995 . Although their eighth studio album , Ghost Reveries , was quite popular in the United States , Opeth did not experience major American commercial success until the 2008 release of their ninth studio album , Watershed , which peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard 200 , and topped the Finnish albums chart in its first week of release . Opeth has sold over 1 @.@ 5 million albums and DVDs worldwide , including 300 @,@ 000 collective <unk> of their albums Blackwater Park , Damnation and Deliverance in the United States . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Formation ( 1990 – 1993 ) = = = 
 Opeth was formed as a death metal band in the autumn of 1990 in Stockholm , Sweden by vocalist David Isberg . Isberg asked former Eruption band member Mikael Åkerfeldt ( just 16 years old at the time ) to join Opeth as a bassist . When Åkerfeldt showed up to practice the day after Isberg invited him , it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members , including the band 's current bassist , that Åkerfeldt would be joining . An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and Åkerfeldt leaving to form a new project . The band name was derived from the word " Opet , " taken from the Wilbur Smith novel The Sunbird . In this novel , Opet is the name of a fictional Phoenician city in South Africa whose name is translated as " City of the Moon " . 
 Isberg and Åkerfeldt recruited drummer Anders Nordin , bassist Nick Döring , and guitarist Andreas Dimeo . Unsatisfied with Opeth 's slow progress , Döring and Dimeo left the band after their first performance , and were replaced by guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist Johan De <unk> . After the next show , DeFarfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in Germany , and was initially replaced by Mattias Ander , before Åkerfeldt 's friend Peter Lindgren took on the role of bassist . Rhythm guitarist Kim Pettersson left following the band 's next performance , and Lindgren switched to guitar , with the role of bassist falling to Stefan Guteklint . The following year , David Isberg left the band citing " creative differences " . 
 Following Isberg 's departure , Åkerfeldt took over vocal duties and he , Lindgren , and Nordin spent the next year writing and rehearsing new material . The group began to rely less on the blast beats and aggression typical of death metal , and incorporated acoustic guitars and guitar harmonies into their music ; developing the core sound of Opeth . Bassist Guteklint was dismissed by the band after they signed their first record deal with Candlelight Records in 1994 . Opeth initially employed former member DeFarfalla as a session bassist for their demo recordings , and he went on to join on a full @-@ time basis following the release of Opeth 's debut album , " Orchid " , in 1995 . 
 = = = Orchid , Morningrise , and My Arms , Your Hearse ( 1994 – 1998 ) = = = 
 Opeth recorded its debut album , Orchid , with producer Dan <unk> in April 1994 . Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records , the album was not released until May 15 , 1995 , and only in Europe . Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal , featuring acoustic guitars , piano , and clean vocals . AllMusic called Orchid " brilliant , " " startlingly unique , " and " a far @-@ beyond @-@ epic prog / death monstrosity exuding equal parts beauty and brutality . " 
 After a few live shows in the United Kingdom , Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album , again produced by Dan <unk> . The album was named Morningrise , and was released in Europe on June 24 , 1996 . With only five songs , but lasting 66 minutes ; it features Opeth 's longest song , the twenty @-@ minute " Black Rose Immortal " . Morningrise was a huge success , with Allmusic giving the album four stars . Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise , followed by a 26 @-@ date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth . While on tour , Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records , who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997 . 
 In 1997 , after the tour , Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed DeFarfalla for personal reasons , without the consent of Nordin . When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin , who was on a vacation in Brazil , Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons . Former Eternal members , drummer Martín López ( formerly of Amon Amarth ) and bassist Martín Méndez , responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt . The <unk> were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job . Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the <unk> to join at first , due to them already knowing each other ; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn 't be two camps in the band , but eventually hired both . López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden 's " Remember Tomorrow " , which was included on the album A Call to Irons : A Tribute to Iron Maiden . 
 With a larger recording budget from Century Media , Opeth began work on its third album , with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström , at Studio Fredman in August 1997 . Although Opeth had Méndez , due to time constraints Åkerfeldt played bass on the album . My Arms , Your Hearse was released to critical acclaim on August 18 , 1998 . 
 = = = Still Life and Blackwater Park ( 1999 – 2001 ) = = = 
 In 1999 , the ownership of Candlelight Records changed hands , with owner and friend of the band Lee Barrett leaving the company . Opeth signed with UK label <unk> Records in Europe , which was distributed by Music for Nations . Opeth reserved time at Studio Fredman to begin work on its next album , but recording was postponed while the studio was relocated . Due to time constraints , the band was able to rehearse only twice before entering the studio . Delays with the album 's artwork pushed the release back an additional month and Still Life was released on October 18 , 1999 . Due to problems with the band 's new distribution network , the album was not released in the United States until February 2001 . Still Life was the first album recorded with Méndez , and also the first Opeth album to bear any kind of caption on the front cover upon its initial release , including the band 's logo . Allmusic called Still Life a " formidable splicing of harsh , often jagged guitar riffs with graceful melodies . " As explained by Åkerfeldt , Still Life is a concept album : " The main character is kind of banished from his hometown because he hasn 't got the same faith as the rest of the inhabitants there . The album pretty much starts off when he is returning after several years to hook up with his old ' babe . ' The big bosses of the town know that he 's back ... A lot of bad things start happening . " 
 Following a few live dates in Europe , Opeth returned to Studio Fredman to begin work on its next album , with Porcupine Tree 's Steven Wilson producing . The band sought to recreate the recording experience of Still Life , and again entered the studio with minimal rehearsals , and no lyrics written . " This time it was tough , " Åkerfeldt said , " I feel pleasantly blown away by the immense result , though . It was indeed worth the effort . " Wilson also pushed the band to expand its sound , incorporating new sounds and production techniques . " Steve guided us into the realms of ' strange ' noises for guitars and voice , " Åkerfeldt said . 
 Opeth released its fifth studio album , Blackwater Park , on February 21 , 2001 . Allmusic called Blackwater Park " astounding , a work of breathtaking creative breadth , " noting that the album " keeps with Opeth 's tradition by transcending the limits of death / black metal and repeatedly shattering the foundations of conventional songwriting . " In support of Blackwater Park , Opeth embarked on its first world tour , headlined Europe for the first time , and made an appearance at the 2001 Wacken Open Air festival in Germany , playing to a crowd of 60 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Deliverance and Damnation ( 2002 – 2004 ) = = = 
 Opeth returned to Sweden after touring in support of Blackwater Park , and began writing for the next album . At first , Åkerfeldt had trouble putting together new material : " I wanted to write something heavier than we 'd ever done , still I had all these great mellow parts and arrangements which I didn 't want to go to waste . " Jonas <unk> of <unk> , a long @-@ time friend of Åkerfeldt , suggested writing music for two separate albums — one heavy and one soft . 
 Excited at the prospect , Åkerfeldt agreed without consulting his band mates or record label . While his band mates liked the idea of recording two separate albums , Åkerfeldt had to convince the label : " I had to lie somewhat ... saying that we could do this recording very soon , it won 't cost more than a regular single album . " With most of the material written , the band rehearsed just once before entering <unk> Studios in 2002 , and again with producer Steven Wilson in Studio Fredman . Under pressure to complete both albums simultaneously , Åkerfeldt said the recording process was " the toughest test of our history . " After recording basic tracks , the band moved production to England to first mix the heavy album , Deliverance , with Andy Sneap at Backstage Studios . " Deliverance was so poorly recorded , without any organisation whatsoever , " Åkerfeldt claimed , that Sneap " is credited as a ' saviour ' in the sleeve , as he surely saved much of the recording . " 
 Deliverance was released on November 4 , 2002 , and debuted at number 19 on the US Top Independent Albums chart , marking the band 's first US chart appearance . Allmusic stated , " Deliverance is altogether more subtle than any of its predecessors , approaching listeners with haunting nuances and masterful dynamics rather than overwhelming them with sheer mass and complexity . " 
 Opeth performed a one @-@ off concert in Stockholm , then returned to the UK to finish recording vocals for the second of the two albums , Damnation , at Steven Wilson 's No Man 's Land Studios . Although Åkerfeldt believed the band could not finish both albums , Opeth completed Deliverance and Damnation in just seven weeks of studio time , which was the same amount spent on Blackwater Park alone . Damnation was released on April 14 , 2003 , and garnered the band its first appearance on the US Billboard 200 at number 192 . The album also won the 2003 Swedish Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance . On January 1 , 2016 , Opeth re @-@ released both Deliverance and Damnation in one package , containing CD and DVD versions , along with new mixing . 
 The band embarked on its biggest tour yet , playing nearly 200 shows in 2003 and 2004 . Opeth performed three special shows in Europe with two song lists each — one acoustic set and one heavy set . The band recorded its first DVD , Lamentations ( Live at Shepherd 's Bush Empire 2003 ) , at Shepherd 's Bush Empire in London , England . The DVD features a two @-@ hour performance , including the entire Damnation album , several songs from Deliverance and Blackwater Park , and a one @-@ hour documentary about the recording of Deliverance and Damnation . Lamentations was certified Gold in Canada . 
 Opeth was scheduled to perform in Jordan without a crew due to the fear of terrorist attacks in the Middle East . Opeth 's tour manager distributed 6 @,@ 000 tickets for the concert , but before the band left for Jordan , drummer Lopez called Åkerfeldt stating he was having an anxiety attack and could not perform , forcing the band to cancel the show . In early 2004 , Lopez was sent home from Canada after more anxiety attacks on tour . Opeth decided against cancelling the remainder of the tour , with Lopez 's drum technician filling in for two concerts . Lopez promised that he would return to the tour as soon as he could , but two shows later Opeth asked Strapping Young Lad drummer Gene Hoglan to fill in . Lopez returned to Opeth for the Seattle show on the final leg of the Deliverance and Damnation tour . Per Wiberg also joined the band on tour to perform keyboards , after more than a year on tour . 
 = = = Ghost Reveries ( 2005 @-@ 2007 ) = = = 
 Opeth returned home in 2004 to start writing new material for its eighth album , and by the end of the year , they had finished writing it . Opeth 's European label , Music for Nations , closed its doors in 2005 , and after negotiations with various labels , the band signed with Roadrunner Records . Åkerfeldt said the primary reason for signing with Roadrunner was the label 's wide distribution , ensuring the album would be available at larger @-@ chain retailers . When news leaked that the band was signed to Roadrunner , who predominantly worked with trend @-@ oriented rock and metal , some fans accused the band of selling out . " To be honest , " Åkerfeldt said , " that 's such an insult after 15 years as a band and 8 records . I can 't believe we haven 't earned each and every Opeth fan 's credibility after all these years . I mean , our songs are 10 minutes long ! " The band rehearsed for three weeks before entering the studio , the first time the band rehearsed since the 1998 album , My Arms , Your Hearse . During rehearsal , keyboardist Wiberg joined Opeth as a full @-@ time member . Opeth recorded at Fascination Street Studios in Örebro , Sweden , from March 18 to June 1 , 2005 , and released the resulting Ghost Reveries on August 30 , 2005 , to critical acclaim and commercial success . The album debuted at number 64 in the US , and number nine in Sweden , higher than any previous Opeth release . Keith Bergman of Blabbermouth.net gave the album ten out of ten , one of only 21 albums to achieve a perfect rating from the site . Rod Smith of Decibel magazine called Ghost Reveries " achingly beautiful , sometimes unabashedly brutal , often a combination of both . " 
 On May 12 , 2006 , Martin Lopez announced that he had officially parted ways with Opeth due to health problems , and was replaced by Martin <unk> . Opeth toured on the main stage of Gigantour in 2006 , alongside Megadeth . Ghost Reveries was re @-@ released on October 31 , 2006 , with a bonus cover song ( Deep Purple 's " Soldier of Fortune " ) , a DVD featuring a 5 @.@ 1 surround sound mix of the album and a documentary on the making of the record . A recording of Opeth 's live performance at the Camden Roundhouse , in London , on November 9 , 2006 , was released as the double live album The Roundhouse Tapes , which topped the Finnish DVD chart . 
 On May 17 , 2007 , Peter Lindgren announced he would be leaving Opeth after 16 years . " The decision has been the toughest I 've ever made but it is the right one to make at this point in my life , " Lindgren said . " I feel that I simply have lost some of the enthusiasm and inspiration needed to participate in a band that has grown from a few guys playing the music we love to a worldwide industry . " Ex @-@ Arch Enemy guitarist Fredrik Åkesson replaced Lindgren , as Åkerfeldt explained " Fredrik was the only name that popped up thinking about a replacement for Peter . In my opinion he 's one of the top three guitar players out of Sweden . We all get along great as we 've known each other for maybe four years and he already has the experience to take on the circus @-@ like lifestyle we lead as members of Opeth . " 
 = = = Watershed and In Live Concert at the Royal Albert Hall ( 2008 – 2010 ) = = = 
 Opeth entered Fascination Street Studios in November 2007 to record their ninth studio album , with Åkerfeldt producing . By January 2008 , Opeth had recorded 13 songs , including three cover songs . The finished album , Watershed , features seven tracks , with cover songs used as bonus tracks on different versions of the album . Watershed was released on June 3 , 2008 . Åkerfeldt described the songs on the album as " a bit more energetic " . Opeth toured in support of Watershed , including headlining the UK Defenders of the Faith tour with Arch Enemy , an appearance at Wacken Open Air , and the Progressive Nation tour with headliner Dream Theater . Watershed was Opeth 's highest @-@ charting album to date , debuting at number 23 on the US Billboard 200 , on the Australian ARIA album charts at number seven and at number one on Finland 's official album chart . Opeth went on a worldwide tour in support of Watershed . From September to October , the band toured North America backed by High on Fire , Baroness , and <unk> . They returned to tour Europe for the rest of the year with Cynic and The Ocean . 
 In 2010 , Opeth wrote and recorded the new track , " The Throat of Winter " , which appeared on the digital EP soundtrack of the video game , God of War III . Åkerfeldt described the song as " odd " and " not very metal . " To celebrate their 20th anniversary , Opeth performed a six @-@ show , worldwide tour called Evolution XX : An Opeth Anthology , from March 30 through April 9 , 2010 . Blackwater Park was performed in its entirety , along with several songs never before performed . The concert of April 5 , 2010 , at the Royal Albert Hall in London , England was filmed for a DVD and live album package titled In Live Concert at the Royal Albert Hall . The set was released on September 21 , 2010 , in 2 @-@ DVD and 2 @-@ DVD / 3 @-@ CD configurations . For the DVD the concert was split into two sets . The first set consists of the entire Blackwater Park album , while the second set contains one song from every album excluding Blackwater Park , in chronological order representing the twenty years of " evolution " in their music . Åkerfeldt stated , " I can 't believe it , but , fuck , we 're celebrating 20 years . I 've been in this band ever since I was 16 . It 's insane . " A special edition of Blackwater Park was released in March 2010 to coincide with the tour . 
 = = = Heritage ( 2011 – 2013 ) = = = 
 In September 2010 , Mikael Åkerfeldt stated that he was writing for a new Opeth album . The band announced on their website that they would start recording their tenth album on January 31 , 2011 , at the Atlantis / Metronome studios in Stockholm , once again with Jens <unk> ( engineering ) and Steven Wilson from Porcupine Tree as co @-@ producer . 
 Shortly after mixing was complete on the new album in April 2011 , Opeth announced that Per Wiberg was relieved of his duties in the band . In the press statement , Mikael Åkerfeldt explained the decision , saying , " Mendez , Axe and Fredrik and I came to the decision that we should find a replacement for Per right after the recordings of the new album , and this came as no surprise to Per . He had , in turn , been thinking about leaving , so you could say it was a mutual decision . There 's no bad blood , just a relationship that came to an end , and that 's that . " 
 Opeth 's tenth album , Heritage , was released on September 14 , 2011 , to generally favorable reviews . The album sold 19 @,@ 000 copies in the United States in its first week of release and debuted at number 19 on the Billboard 200 chart . Heritage debuted at number four in the band 's native country of Sweden . 
 Heritage became the second Opeth album to not feature any death growls and had a much more progressive style than previous albums from the band , something that Åkerfeldt had been wanting to do for some time . 
 The first two songs Åkerfeldt wrote for Heritage were in the style of Watershed . After hearing the songs for the first time , Martín Méndez told Åkerfeldt that he would be disappointed if the album continued in that direction . Relieved that Méndez was not interested in doing another conventional Opeth album , Åkerfeldt scrapped the two songs and started the writing process over in a different style . In the press release for Heritage , Mikael Åkerfeldt revealed that he felt as though he had been building to write the album since he was 19 years old . In a review for Allmusic , Thom Jurek called Heritage the band 's most adventurous album , describing the songs as " drenched in instrumental interludes , knotty key and chord changes , shifting time signatures , clean vocals , and a keyboard @-@ heavy instrumentation that includes Mellotrons , Rhodes pianos , and Hammond organs " . 
 Opeth supported Heritage with a tour that would last for over 200 tour dates . The tour was the band 's first with new keyboardist , Joakim <unk> , who played on the opening track of the album . During the tour , Opeth played with bands such as <unk> , Pain of Salvation , Mastodon , Ghost and Anathema all over the world in countries such as the United States , Europe , Turkey , India , Japan , Greece , Israel , Latin America and Sweden . The tour concluded with " <unk> 2013 " . 
 = = = Pale Communion ( 2013 – 2015 ) = = = 
 On August 26 , 2014 , Opeth released its eleventh studio album , titled Pale Communion . Åkerfeldt began working on new material as far back as August 2012 . In January 2014 he stated , " We 've been looking at [ tracking the next album at ] Rockfield Studios in Wales where Queen recorded " Bohemian Rhapsody " , but we haven 't made a decision yet , but it will be an expensive album . There 's a lot going on , lots of string arrangements that we haven 't had in the past . " Despite fearing that the band 's new musical direction would split Opeth 's fanbase , when asked if it will it be heavier or softer than Heritage , Åkerfeldt said , " Maybe a little bit heavier , not death metal heavy , but hard rock / heavy metal heavy . There 's also lots of progressive elements and acoustic guitars , but also more sinister @-@ sounding riffs . " Åkerfeldt also produced the new album which will include string instrumentation , something that he became interested in doing when working on Storm Corrosion . The band members in Opeth felt rejuvenated after creating Heritage which resulted in closer relationships between them . 
 The Guardian reviewed Pale Communion positively , calling it " strange , intricate prog @-@ metal genius " somewhat flawed by Åkerfeldt 's indulgent vocal stylings . The album saw Opeth 's highest chart positions in the history of the band with Pale Communion debuting at number 19 in the US , number 3 in Sweden , and number 14 in the United Kingdom . It sold 13 @,@ 000 copies in its first week of release in the US . 
 Pale Communion was supported with more touring from Opeth . In 2015 , Opeth played several concerts to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the band . At these special shows , the band was doing two sets . The first set is 2005 's Ghost Reveries as a ten @-@ year anniversary celebration of the album . The second set spanned the rest of the band 's career , celebrating their 25th anniversary . Åkerfeldt expressed excitement for the concerts 
 = = = Sorceress ( 2016 – present ) = = = 
 On June 15 , 2016 , Nuclear Blast Entertainment announced the signing of Opeth . Three days later , on June 18th , Opeth released a 30 @-@ second teaser for their new album , Sorceress . A month later , on July 18th , the band confirmed the album would be released on September 30th , in addition to revealing the artwork and track list . Mikael Åkerfeldt described it as " a fine little record . My favorite in our discography right now . Of course . That 's how it should be , right ? It 's both fresh and old , both progressive and rehashed . Heavy and calm . Just the way we like it . " 
 On July 25 , 2016 , in the build up towards the album release , the band posted the first ' Sorceress ' Making Of <unk> on their YouTube channel . In the behind @-@ the @-@ scenes studio tour , it is confirmed that the band had returned to Rockfield Studios where they previously recorded Pale Communion . At the end of the video , there is a 20 second excerpt of a track believed to be from the album featuring heavily down @-@ tuned guitars . 
 = = Musical style and influence = = 
 As Opeth 's primary songwriter and lyricist , vocalist / guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth 's sound . He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands Camel , <unk> and Gracious , and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden , Slayer , Death , Black Sabbath , Deep Purple , Celtic Frost , King Diamond , Morbid Angel , Voivod , and most importantly Judas Priest . Åkerfeldt considers Sad Wings of Destiny the best metal album of all time , and notes that there was a time when he only listened to Judas Priest . Åkerfeldt sings " Here Come the Tears " by Judas Priest before most Opeth concerts while warming up . Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music , both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band . 
 Opeth 's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock . Steve Huey of Allmusic refers to Opeth 's " epic , progressive death metal style . " Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth 's sound as incorporating " the likes of folk , funk , blues , ' 70s rock , goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style . " In his review of Opeth 's 2001 album Blackwater Park , Allmusic 's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote , " Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion , usually traversing ample musical terrain , including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages , ambient soundscapes , stoner rock grooves , and Eastern @-@ tinged melodies — any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment . " Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth 's music : 
 I don 't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything . It would be impossible for us to play just death metal ; that is our roots , but we are now a mishmash of everything , and not purists to any form of music . It 's impossible for us to do that , and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music . We 're not afraid to experiment , or to be caught with our pants down , so to speak . That 's what keeps us going . 
 More recently , Opeth have abandoned their death metal sound resulting in a mellower progressive rock sound . When talking about Heritage , guitarist Fredrik Åkesson stated : 
 In the beginning it took me a little while to get used to the new idea of the sound , not having any screaming vocals and stuff like that . But I think the album was necessary for us to do . Maybe the band wouldn 't have continued if we hadn 't done Heritage . I think the old Opeth fans understand this album . There 's always going to be some haters , but you can 't be loved by everyone . Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself . A lot of people don 't think Heritage is metal but I think it 's metal to go somewhere people don 't expect . It doesn 't mean we 're not embracing the past sound of Opeth . 
 Vocally , Åkerfeldt shifts between traditional death metal vocals for heavy sections , and clean , sometimes whispered or soft @-@ spoken vocals over mellower passages . While his death growls were dominant on early releases , later efforts incorporate more clean vocals , with Damnation , Heritage and Pale Communion featuring only clean singing . Rivadavia noted that " Åkerfeldt 's vocals run the gamut from bowel @-@ churning grunts to melodies of chilling beauty — depending on each movement section 's mood . "

 = Paco de Lucía = 
 Francisco Gustavo Sánchez Gomez ( 21 December 1947 – 25 February 2014 ) , known as Paco de Lucía [ <unk> ðe <unk> ] , was a Spanish virtuoso flamenco guitarist , composer and producer . A leading proponent of the new flamenco style , he helped legitimize flamenco among the establishment in Spain , and was one of the first flamenco guitarists to have successfully crossed over into other genres of music such as classical and jazz . Richard Chapman and Eric Clapton , authors of Guitar : Music , History , Players , describe de Lucía as a " titanic figure in the world of flamenco guitar " , and Dennis Koster , author of Guitar Atlas , Flamenco , has referred to de Lucía as " one of history 's greatest guitarists " . 
 De Lucía was <unk> noted for his unusually fast and fluent picados ( fingerstyle runs ) and powerful rhythmic strumming . He is generally thought to have been one of the most technically gifted and accomplished guitarists of any age . A master of contrast , he was known for his tendency to juxtapose fast and aggressive playing with more sensitive styles , and pioneered the incorporation of abstract and unusual chords and scale tones in his compositions , reflecting his jazz influences . These innovations saw De Lucía play a key role in the development of traditional flamenco and the evolution of new flamenco and Latin jazz fusion . He received enormous acclaim for his recordings with legendary flamenco singer Camarón de la Isla in the 1970s , recording ten albums which are considered some of the most important and influential in flamenco history . His recording of Joaquin <unk> 's Concierto De Aranjuez in a flamenco style is often considered one of the best and most unique recordings of the much @-@ loved composition . 
 Some of De Lucía 's best known recordings include Río Ancho ( later fused with Al Di Meola 's Mediterranean Sundance ) , Entre dos aguas , La Barrosa , Ímpetu , Cepa Andaluza and Gloria al Niño Ricardo . His collaborations with guitarists John McLaughlin , Al Di Meola and Larry Coryell in the late 1970s saw him gain wider popularity outside his native Spain . De Lucía formed the Paco de Lucía Sextet in 1981 with his brothers , singer Pepe de Lucía and guitarist Ramón de Algeciras , and collaborated with jazz pianist Chick Corea on their 1990 album , <unk> . In 1992 , he performed live at Expo ' 92 in Seville and a year later on the Plaza Mayor in Madrid . After 2004 he greatly reduced his public performances , retiring from full touring , and typically only gave several concerts a year , usually in Spain and Germany and at European festivals during the summer months . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Paco de Lucía was born on 21 December 1947 as Francisco Sánchez Gomez in Algeciras , a city near the far southern point of Spain in the province of Cádiz . He was the youngest of the five children of flamenco guitarist Antonio Sánchez <unk> and Portuguese mother Lúcia Gomez ; his brothers include flamenco singer Pepe de Lucía and flamenco guitarist Ramón de Algeciras ( now deceased ) . Playing in the streets as a young boy , there were many <unk> and <unk> in Algeciras , and he wanted to honor his Portuguese mother Lucia Gomez , so he adopted the stage name Paco de Lucía . 
 His father Antonio received guitar lessons from the hand of a cousin of Melchor de Marchena : Manuel Fernández ( aka Titi de Marchena ) , a guitarist who arrived in Algeciras in the 1920s and established a school there . Antonio introduced Paco to the guitar at a young age and was extremely strict in his upbringing from the age of 5 , forcing him to practice up to 12 hours a day , every day , to ensure that he could find success as a professional musician . At one point , his father took him out of school to concentrate solely on his guitar development . In a 2012 interview de Lucía stated that , " I learned the guitar like a child learns to speak . " Flamenco guitarist and biographer Donn Pohren and record producer José Torregrosa compared Paco 's relationship with his father to the relationship of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Leopold Mozart in the way both fathers " moulded their sons " into becoming world @-@ class musicians , and both continued to dictate even after they became famous . Paco 's brother Ramón idolized Niño Ricardo , and taught his complex <unk> to his young brother , who would learn them with relative ease and change them to his own liking and embellish them . This angered Ramón initially who considered Ricardo 's works to be sacred and thought his brother was showing off , but he soon began to immensely respect his brother and came to realize that he was a prodigious talent and a <unk> de serie , a special person . Like his brother , Ricardo was Paco 's most important influence , and his first guitar hero ; Paco said " all of us youngsters would look up to him , trying to learn from him and copy him . " In 1958 , at age 11 , Paco made his first public appearance on Radio Algeciras . That year , he met Sabicas for the first time in Málaga . A year later , he was awarded a special prize at the Festival <unk> International Flamenco de Jerez de la Frontera flamenco competition .

 At the age of 14 he made his first record with his brother Pepe , Los Chiquitos de Algeciras ( Kids of Algeciras ) . In the early 1960s , de Lucía toured with the flamenco troupe of dancer José Greco . In New York City in 1963 , at the age of 15 , he had his second encounter with Sabicas and his first encounter with Mario Escudero , both of whom became de Lucía 's mentors and later close friends . They urged him to start writing his own material , advice he took to heart . In 1964 , he met <unk> guitarist Ricardo Modrego with whom he recorded three albums : Dos guitarras flamencas ( 1964 ) , 12 <unk> de García Lorca para guitarra and 12 <unk> para 2 guitarras flamencas ( 1965 ) . His early albums were traditional flamenco recordings and he recorded classics such as <unk> on the 12 <unk> para 2 guitarras flamencas album . He toured again with José Greco in 1966 and recorded Ímpetu , a <unk> composed by Mario Escudero , for his debut solo album , La <unk> guitarra de Paco de Lucía ( 1967 ) . He appeared at the 1967 Berlin Jazz Festival . According to Gerhard <unk> , top jazz musicians who appeared at the festival ( i.e. Miles Davis , Thelonious Monk ) , profoundly influenced de Lucía , and sparked a fascination for jazz that remained with him throughout his life . 
 In the late 1960s , de Lucía toured Europe with a group called Festival Flamenco Gitano and encountered other new talents in the flamenco world including singer Camarón de la Isla , with whom he enjoyed a fruitful collaboration between 1968 and 1977 . They recorded ten albums together and received considerable acclaim . Richard <unk> said that their partnership was " central to the history of flamenco in the last quarter of the twentieth century . " Organizers began offering de Lucía lucrative contracts for concert tours in 1967 , which he declined as he preferred to tour in company , which he did with his brother Ramón , de la Isla and other musicians . De Lucía recorded many albums with his brother , including <unk> <unk> para 2 guitarras ( 1967 ) , Dos guitarras flamencas en América Latina ( 1967 ) , <unk> <unk> de Paco de Lucía ( 1969 ) , and 12 Hits para 2 guitarras flamencas y <unk> de <unk> ( 1969 ) . They met Esteban <unk> in Buenos Aires and Juan Serrano in Detroit , and during 1970 spent considerable time in New York City where they grew close to Sabicas and Mario Escudero , playing together into the night .

 De Lucía made a cameo appearance , dressed as a Mexican guitarist , in the 1971 western <unk> Caulder , playing the melody of Ken Thorne 's main theme over a string section . That year , he released the album El mundo del flamenco , which included a version of Mario Escudero 's Ímpetu , a bulerías . Guitar International mentioned his " very aggressive " approach to playing Ímpetu . Escudero was a major influence on de Lucía during this period , inspiring him to explore new possibilities for flamenco . He began working with record producer José Torregrosa . 
 De Lucía 's 1972 release El <unk> flamenco de Paco de Lucía was considered a groundbreaking album in the flamenco community . As the 1970s progressed , de Lucía continued to produce groundbreaking albums and ventured into an increasingly unconventional and innovative style of flamenco with jazz influences . His next release , Fuente y caudal , acclaimed particularly for his Entre dos aguas , which has become arguably his best @-@ known composition , and also for Solera and Cepa Andaluza . Entre dos aguas , a rumba featuring bongos with an electric bass , means " Between two waters , " referring to his home town of Algeciras , where the Mediterranean meets the Atlantic . Biographer Pohren describes Cepa Andaluza as a " phenomenal " bulerías , which is " accompanied by <unk> , shouts of encouragement and general <unk> , and makes one want to leap up and dance . " The album also features several other tracks named after Andalusian landmarks , a theme de Lucía continued in his later albums . The Fuente y caudal album was one of the best @-@ selling Spanish records for several months and de Lucía and Torregrosa found that the additional instruments and approach away from traditional flamenco proved more popular with the general public . The early influences of the traditional players became increasingly less apparent as de Lucía embraced jazz and other influences , creating his own voice and distinct style , yet never venturing too far from his roots . 
 On 18 February 1975 , de Lucía became the first @-@ ever flamenco performer to perform at the Teatro Real of Madrid . He played a set with his brother Ramón , in front of a relatively young audience without the use of effects . Pohren said that de Lucía 's performance " was brilliant technically , and played a meaningful , moving , traditional brand of flamenco that did not betray what Paco had in store for the flamenco guitar in the future . " The recording was released as En vivo <unk> el Teatro Real . His 1976 album , Almoraima , was a wider success and featured Almoraima and Río Ancho . The album was named after a former convent of the same name located about 21 kilometres ( 13 mi ) from Algeciras on the road to Jimena de la Frontera , which had recently been converted into a hotel complex . The album featured significant Arabic and jazz influences especially in the bulerías composition of the same name ; the name Almoraima is of Arabic origin from the Moorish period . De Lucía performed on an episode of Parkinson on BBC in the UK , in which Michael Parkinson said " a marvelous young musician who is making his very first appearance on British television . His unconventional and modern approach to playing flamenco has already made him a big star in Europe , particularly in his native Spain . " 
 In 1977 , de Lucía married Casilda Varela , the daughter of General Varela ; they had three children . He released his final album , Castillo de Arena with Camarón de la Isla , The lyrics were written by Antonio Sánchez , with the exception of the bulerías Samara , which Sánchez and de la Isla wrote together . This would be his last LP with a singer for at least 15 years . He reportedly said that the human voice is " naturally too limited " and that he prefers the exploration of different instrumentalists ; he also said a busy schedule was the reason for lack of recordings with singers . He performed extensively across the US and Europe during this period , increasing his popularity outside Spain and the flamenco community in Europe , and met many jazz , Latin and other musicians who continued to influence de Lucía 's evolution as a " Nuevo flamenco " player . He began to show a very keen interest in jazz fusion and rock , and in 1977 performed with Carlos Santana in the Plaza de toros de las Arenas bullring in Barcelona . He was invited by Al Di Meola to record on his " Mediterranean Sundance " piece for his album Elegant Gypsy . Despite considerable new interest in flamenco and de Lucía 's playing generated by the album , traditionalist flamenco critics did not approve of the piece and hated that many people considered Mediterranean Sundance flamenco music and frowned upon de Lucía . Di Meola informed the critics not to worry and that " Paco is not leaving flamenco , but expanding it . " In 1978 , Paco and his brothers recorded <unk> a Manuel de Falla , a classical effort of compositions by Manuel de Falla . 
 In 1979 , de Lucía , John McLaughlin , and Larry Coryell formed The Guitar Trio and together made a tour of Europe and released a video recorded at London 's Royal Albert Hall entitled Meeting of the Spirits . Pohren said that de Lucía 's decision to work with musicians like McLaughlin , Di Meola , Coryell , and Chick Corea must have been an " exciting and stimulating " experience for him , given their technical musical knowledge and ability to improvise and said that they carried him " so far afield that at times he must have been profoundly confused , a man running the risk of losing his musical identity . " This concerned de Lucía , who said in a late 1990s interview , " I have never lost the roots in my music , because I would lose myself . What I have tried to do is have a hand holding onto tradition and the other scratching , digging in other places , trying to find new things I can bring into flamenco . " 
 = = = 1980s = = = 
 The Guitar Trio continued touring in 1980 . De Lucía reportedly suffered from headaches and <unk> while performing because he found it difficult to improvise and follow McLaughlin and Coryell 's advanced knowledge of jazz improvisation . Paco professed , " Some people assume that they were learning from me , but I can tell you it was me learning from them . I have never studied music , I am incapable of studying harmony — I don 't have the discipline , playing with McLaughlin and Di Meola was about learning these things . " In 1981 , Coryell was replaced with Di Meola , and The Guitar Trio released one of their most successful records , Friday Night in San Francisco , which sold over 1 million copies and generated a significant interest in flamenco music in America and Europe . It featured an extended combination of Mediterranean Sundance and Río Ancho ; this became arguably the piece most associated with the musicians . De Lucía also formed the Paco de Lucía Sextet in 1981 ( which included his brothers Ramón and Pepe ) , and released the first of its three albums that same year . On 30 August 1981 , de Lucía performed a solo set at St. <unk> in Germany , where he performed Monasterio de Sal and <unk> among others and later performed with The Guitar Trio . The event was broadcast on national WDR television . 
 In 1982 , Paco put on a series of concerts with jazz pianist Chick Corea . Corea was a considerable influence on him in the 1980s and he and McLaughlin adapted a version of his piece Spain , performing it live together several times in the mid to late 1980s . He released a " Golden " double compilation album in 1982 , La <unk> de Oro de Paco de Lucía , covering Paco 's earliest recordings with Ricardo Modrego of Federico García Lorca songs to date , and featured two <unk> , a flamenco form in which he hadn 't indulged in his recordings since 1972 . In 1983 , the Trio released Passion , Grace & Fire , and he had an acting role in Carlos Saura 's highly acclaimed film Carmen , for which he was also nominated for a BAFTA Film Award for Best Score . De Lucía composed original film scores for several films in the 1980s , including The Hit , a 1984 film in which he provided the soundtrack with Eric Clapton , with a minor contribution by Roger Waters . 
 On his 1984 album , Live ... One Summer Night , De Lucía not only played guitar , but also filled the role of producer . Paco de Lucía has also appeared as himself on television in documentaries and TV shows and accepted a position as a judge at Seville 's 1984 <unk> . 
 By the mid @-@ 1980s , both the Sextet and the Guitar Trio had reached its plateau and stopped performing together , although de Lucía would continue to perform with McLaughlin as a duo across Europe in 1986 and later . In a 1986 interview with Down Beat magazine , Di Meola said that the reason for the breakdown was that their performances were designed to " drive the audience berserk " with a display of astonishing virtuosity and that they had run out of new spectacular fast runs to impress the audiences . Di Meola remarked that the music had become too " wild and crazy " and that he preferred to explore the quieter side of music , something Paco also felt , saying that he preferred " controlled expression to velocity . " In May 1986 , he performed at the Centro de Bellas Artes Rock music festival alongside the likes of Earl Klugh , Spyro <unk> , and Dave Valentin . In 1987 , de Lucía performed for the first time in the Soviet Union , and went back to his roots with his highly successful release , Siroco . Siroco is often cited as his best album and one of the greatest flamenco albums of all time . 
 His compositions La Cañada , the opening track , a tango called La Barrosa , an <unk> named after the Playa la Barrosa in the province of Cadiz , and Gloria al Niño Ricardo , a <unk> , received considerable attention and are considered modern flamenco classics . Eric Clapton and Richard Chapman described La Barrosa , a sweet <unk> played in B major , as , " full of effortless delicacy with cascading phrases . " " Gloria al Niño Ricardo " is dedicated to Niño Ricardo who was de Lucía 's " first hero " of the guitar . Several of his compositions from that album form the staple of his contemporary concert performances , and he often begins his concerts with La Cañada . In 1989 , de Lucía refused to perform at the bullring in Seville with Plácido Domingo and Julio Iglesias . 
 = = = 1990s = = = 
 Although the sextet had declined after 1986 , in 1990 they got together to record <unk> , a groundbreaking Arabic flamenco / jazz album with jazz pianist Chick Corea and fellow virtuoso flamenco guitarist Manolo Sanlúcar . The album is named after <unk> , an 8th – 9th century Shiraz @-@ born poet / musician at the Umayyad court in Córdoba , credited with introducing to Spain the Persian lute , which evolved into the Spanish guitar — and according to some , established flamenco itself . One track on the album , a <unk> , is dedicated to Sabicas . The album was critically well @-@ received ; Jazz Times praised the passion and rhythm of the musicians featuring on the album . 
 Until asked to perform and interpret Joaquín Rodrigo 's Concierto de Aranjuez in 1991 , de Lucía was not proficient at reading musical notation . Biographer Pohren , however , at the time of writing his biography in 1992 , said that he was still not proficient and had found a bizarre way of learning the piece , locking himself away . His performance with the orchestra under <unk> <unk> was highly acclaimed , a sensitive , atmospheric rendition that composer Rodrigo himself praised , describing it as " pretty , exotic , inspired " ... I might add that Paco plays it with a great deal of feeling , far more than is normally heard . And that goes for the orchestra that backs him up . " In 1992 , he performed live at the bullring at Seville Expo ' 92 , and a year later on the Plaza Mayor in Madrid , playing " La Barrosa " . In 1995 , he and Bryan Adams recorded the hit song and video Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman on the soundtrack for the American film Don Juan DeMarco . 
 In 1996 , his first " golden hits " album , Antología , was in the top 20 in Spain for at least 16 weeks , selling over 65 @,@ 000 copies . In 1997 , de Lucía performed in a tribute show to the assassinated Spanish politician Miguel Angel Blanco , alongside the likes of Julio Iglesias and Los Del Rio . In 1998 he released and produced " <unk> " , dedicated to his mother ( whose name is spelled phonetically ) . It is considered to be one of de Lucia 's most complete and mature artistic statements .

 De Lucía lived for five years in Yucatan , Mexico , but returned to his native Spain in 2003 after professing to have become really tired with spending his whole life touring for six to eight months a year , getting up at the crack of dawn and living in hotels . He continued to keep a holiday home in Mexico though and regularly visited with his family . 
 In 2004 he toured the United States and Canada with Seville flamenco singer La Tana , but subsequently greatly reduced his live performances in public . He retired from full touring , and would only give a few concerts a year , usually in Spain and Germany and at European festivals during the summer months . Pohren described de Lucía as " extremely timid and retiring " , saying that , " Being a very private person , [ he ] was dismayed at the ensuing popularity and <unk> , and the increased pressure fame placed upon his shoulders , demanding that he constantly innovate and work harder to achieve technical and revolutionary perfection . " 
 In 2003 , de Lucía released Integral ( 2003 ) , a 26 CD Limited Edition Box Set , and Por <unk> , a compilation album . In 2004 , de Lucía released <unk> <unk> with Javier Limón . It was released on Blue Thumb Records by Universal Music Spain S.L. , and features four bulerías , two rumba tracks , a tangos and a <unk> . It won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Flamenco Album 2004 . 
 In 2005 , he was nominated for producer of the year by the Latin Grammy for La Tana 's " Tu , Ven a Mi " , which was De Lucía 's first recording where he directed another artist since working on Camarón de la Isla 's Potro de <unk> y <unk> . 
 In 2004 , he won the Prince of Asturias Awards in Arts , and on 23 March 2007 , the University of Cadiz recognized de Lucía 's musical and cultural contributions by conferring on him the title of Doctor Honoris Causa . In 2010 , he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Berklee College of Music in Boston , and performed at the Montreux Festival . However , he is known some years to select countries where he doesn 't usually perform and played in Pula , Croatia in 2006 and 2010 , and in Turkey , Morocco and Tunisia in 2013 . He appeared at the 49th Carthage International Festival on 31 July , playing at the Roman Theatre .

 De Lucía died of a heart attack on 25 February 2014 , while on holiday with his family in Playa del Carmen , Quintana Roo , Mexico . His remains were buried at a cemetery in Algeciras , Andalusia . De Lucía posthumously won the Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year for his album Canción <unk> at the 2014 awards ceremony . 
 = = Influence = = 
 De Lucía was widely considered to be the world 's premier flamenco guitarist and by many to be Spain 's greatest musical export . He has had a revolutionary influence on flamenco music both as a composer and otherwise . His influence on flamenco guitar has been compared with that of Andrés Segovia 's on classical guitar . His album Fuente y Caudal ( Fountain and Flow ) has been cited by many to have changed the world of flamenco guitar beyond traditional flamenco culture . Along with Enrique <unk> and Camarón de la Isla , de Lucía was the first artist to break away from traditional flamenco and form what is now known as nuevo flamenco . As a composer , de Lucía was the first Spanish artist to mix jazz with Andalusian music in a more or less systematic way . This includes , but is not limited to , his collaborations with Di Meola , McLaughlin , and Pedro <unk> . 
 De Lucía was influenced primarily by Niño Ricardo , a leading figure in the history of flamenco guitar , and Sabicas , regarded as one of the most influential musicians involved in the development and refinement of the flamenco guitar as a concert instrument at a time when the guitar was an instrument to accompany the singer . Sabicas was a mentor to Paco in developing his flamenco guitar technique , as well in honing Paco 's skills as a composer , characterized by melodic structure , rhythmic and harmonic , perfectly consistent from beginning to end , and non @-@ lyrical phrased guitar <unk> when the singer stops singing . Esteban de Sanlúcar and Mario Escudero were also major influences on him and sources of inspiration . According to biographer Pohren , de Lucía was " fascinated with jazz " and held a deep respect for high @-@ tech jazz musicians , regarding Di Meola , McLaughlin , Coryell and Corea as highly as musicians as he did his flamenco mentors . Despite these influences , according to the Jazz Times , " Most flamenco fans can trace the music 's history to either Before Paco or After Paco . " In 2004 interview with El País he said " I have always found that the more technique you have the easier it is to express yourself . If you lack technique you lose the freedom to create . " Like many other flamenco guitarists he often played a Hermanos Conde guitar and had his own signature model , but had a range of guitars in his collection . 
 Richard Chapman and Eric Clapton describe de Lucía as a " titanic figure in the world of flamenco guitar " , highlighting his " astounding technique and inventiveness " and his broad range of musical ideas from other styles , such as Brazilian music and jazz . He is noted for his innovation and colour in harmony and his remarkable dexterity , technique , strength and fluidity in his right hand , capable of executing extremely fast and fluent picados . A master of contrast , he often juxtaposes picados with <unk> and other techniques and often adds abstract chords and scale tones to his compositions with jazz influences . Bill Milkowski of Down Beat described him as " the portrait of studied concentration and pristine perfection : stiff backed and stern faced , with a distinguished air about him that some might misread as haughtiness . He 's proud and majestic , like a regal Arabian steed prancing with grace and elegance , yet able to reveal great power . " Craig Harris of AllMusic noted his " deeply personal melodic statements and modern instrumentation . " Atlanta magazine said , " The guitar , when used properly , can be one of the most haunting and beautiful instruments to create sound ... when he brushes his fingers across the strings , [ he ] can create some of the most incredible music . It 's almost like a lullaby . " José Luis Acosta , president of the Spanish Artists and Editors Society stated that " Paco was and will be a universal artist , who took the guitar and flamenco sentiment to the heart of the whole world . " In 2015 , Billboard magazine named de Lucía as one of The 30 Most Influential Latin Artists of All Time , an editor writes : " The virtuoso <unk> popularized flamenco worldwide , and brought the Spanish sound to the forefront of avant @-@ garde jazz . " . In the same year , he was posthumously inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame for his contributions to flamenco music . 
 Another of Paco de Lucía 's contributions was the inclusion of the cajón , an Afro @-@ Peruvian instrument <unk> Soto exposed to him during his visit to Peru in the late 1970s . He understood this instrument , which he saw as a permanent solution to the need for percussion in flamenco . Along with <unk> Dantas , he added its percussive elements and it became an essential tool of contemporary flamenco and later , other international musical trends .

 NSB Class 73 ( Norwegian : NSB @-@ type 73 ) is a class of 22 electric multiple units built by Adtranz for the Norwegian State Railways . The four @-@ car trains were modifications of Class 71 , which was again based on the Swedish X2 . The A @-@ series consists of 16 intercity trains ; they were delivered in 1999 and 2000 and are used on the Bergen , Dovre and Sørland Lines . The intercity service was branded as Signatur until 2003 . The B @-@ series consists of six regional trains delivered in 2002 and used on the Østfold Line . The regional trains were originally part of the Agenda concept . The trains have a power output of 2 @,@ 646 kilowatts ( 3 @,@ 548 hp ) and a maximum speed of 210 km / h ( 130 mph ) . They have an overall length of 108 meters ( 354 ft ) and have a capacity for 208 seated passengers in the A @-@ series and 250 in the B @-@ series . The trains have tilting mechanism allowing for faster travel through curves . 
 The trains were delivered late , and were put into service after the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate had given dispensation from parts of the safety regulation . On 17 June 2000 , a train derailed at Nelaug Station after an axle broke . The class was grounded for a month , and the investigation showed both design errors , and lack of proper inspection and testing . After they were put back into service , they were not allowed to use the tilting mechanism — thus not being allowed to run faster than their predecessors . The construction was reinforced , and in 2004 , the tilting mechanism was re @-@ enabled along with higher speeds . In 2007 , a train derailed on the Bergen Line , and questions were raised about the trains ' ability to operate in snow , however the accident report showed that the trains ' front axle load was just as able to cope with heavy snow conditions as the locomotives running on the line , and that the derailment would have been more severe if the same conditions would hit a normal train with less secure connections between carriages . On 16 June 2011 , two units were destroyed when the train ran into a fire in a snow tunnel at Hallingskeid Station .

 Class 73 is a four @-@ car electric multiple unit built by Adtranz . Each four @-@ car train has eight bogies — of which three are powered — with a total power output of 2 @,@ 646 kW ( 3 @,@ 548 hp ) . The trains have active tilting , which allows speeds 20 to 30 percent higher than conventional trains through curves on conventional lines . Maximum permitted speed is 210 km / h ( 130 mph ) . A four @-@ car train is 108 @.@ 48 meters ( 355 @.@ 9 ft ) long ; an A @-@ series weighs 215 @.@ 1 tonnes ( 211 @.@ 7 long tons ; 237 @.@ 1 short tons ) while a B @-@ series unit weighs 216 @.@ 1 tonnes ( 212 @.@ 7 long tons ; 238 @.@ 2 short tons ) . The trains have a steel body and the entire cabin is pressurized . Rail brakes are installed on all carrying bogies . 
 The A @-@ series has a capacity of 207 seated passengers , while the B @-@ series has room for 250 . The difference is due to the B @-@ series having a smaller bistro and more compact seating . In the A @-@ series , each of the four cars has seating in a different color ( blue in BFM73 car , green in <unk> , red in BFR73 , and yellow leather in <unk> and in the bistro area in BFR73 ) . Originally , three of the cars had floors with carpet , while the fourth car ( BFM73 ) had vinyl , of consideration to people with allergies . The carpets were removed in about 2005 as it was difficult to keep them clean . Seating is in two classes , standard and <unk> ( originally " Plus " ) ; the latter ( <unk> car ) with leather seating and power supply for laptops . All the cars have cherry tree wood interior . The trains are equipped with a dining section ( BFR73 car ) and warm meals can be served at the seat or in the diner . The menu is according to the time of day , with breakfasts in the morning and larger meals in the afternoon and evening . The trains also feature a family section with a play area and HC area ( BFM73 car ) . The BFM73 car has also a bicycle room behind the driver 's cab . From 2011 , the trains are equipped with free wireless Internet .

 = = = Background = = = 
 In 1990 and 1994 , NSB published two reports regarding the future of intercity rail transport in Norway . The reports concluded that there would have to be invested 56 billion Norwegian krone ( NOK ) in new infrastructure if the main corridors were to be built as high @-@ speed railways . Instead , the use of tilting technology was proposed to allow higher speeds on existing lines . In 1992 , the Parliament of Norway voted to build Oslo Airport , Gardermoen and connect it to the capital with the high @-@ speed Gardermoen Line . It was decided that the service should take 19 minutes — and not one minute more . When issuing invitations to tenders , NSB specified this time limit as a criterion , which was also the reason the line was dimensioned for 210 kilometers per hour ( 130 mph ) . 
 Proposals had been made for NSB to purchase the same units as the Swedish State Railways ( SJ ) , the X2 , in a Nordic cooperation to use the same trains in Norway , Sweden and Denmark , but the idea was abandoned . In 1994 , NSB launched plans to build 200 kilometers ( 120 mi ) of high @-@ speed railways by 2011 , but also these plans were shelved . In May 1995 , Osmund Ueland was hired as director @-@ general of NSB , and he scrapped all plans to build new railways , and instead decided to focus on tilting technology . 
 Class 71 and 73 are based on the Swedish X2 , built by Kalmar Verkstad ( <unk> ) for the Swedish State Railways , and introduced in 1990 . <unk> is built of stainless steel . Forty @-@ three units were delivered by 1997 ; they each considered of a locomotive and two to five unpowered carriages , including a driving trailer . The locomotives had a power output of 3 @,@ 260 kW ( 4 @,@ 370 hp ) and a top speed of 200 km / h ( 120 mph ) . Compared to X2 , Class 73 has an upgraded bogie construction and motors in multiple cars instead of having a locomotive unit . The latter forces a four @-@ car configuration , but allows for better traction and better use of space and weight by placing the technical equipment throughout all four cars . 
 In 1993 , NSB test @-@ ran an X2 train on the Randsfjord Line , and between 29 September and 21 December 1996 , ran a unit in regular service on the Sørland Line . On 23 February 1995 , NSB signed a contract to purchase 16 Class 71 trains for use on the Airport Express Train on the Gardermoen Line . The contract included two options , one for 16 trains for intercity traffic and one for 6 trains for regional traffic . The reason for using the same type of train as the Airport Express Train , was to reduce maintenance and operation costs through having a unified fleet . The options would only modify the trains slightly ; they were primarily designed for the airport service and any optimization for intercity and tilting technology was secondary in the design process . The first option was taken out on 5 March 1997 . 
 The differences between Class 71 and 73 is that the latter has a different interior , four instead of three cars , different door design , the removal of one set of doors per car and the addition of tilting . At the time of ordering , it was announced that the trains would enter service on the Sørland Line during the summer of 1999 , the Dovre Line during the fall of 1999 , and the Bergen Line during the fall of 2000 . Class 71 was delivered in 1997 and 1998 ; one of the units was delivered with tilting technology to test it out — and subsequently removed . The first batch of trains cost NOK 1 @.@ 6 billion . 
 In April 1999 , NSB launched a new branding scheme for their trains . In addition to Puls for local trains and Agenda for regional trains , the Signatur ( " Signature " ) concept was introduced for intercity trains . Signatur would only be used on the Class 73 services , and consist of two classes , Comfort and Comfort Plus . NSB abolished its branding of only having red trains , and introduced a blue and silver livery on the Class 73 trains . The new service had fewer stops and faster travel times . To take advantage of the faster speeds , the Norwegian National Rail Administration needed to do upgrades to the track , overhead wires and signaling for NOK 1 @.@ 2 billion . 
 Tickets on the Signatur service cost NOK 25 more than with conventional trains , which would continue to run . Tickets were also made available via Amadeus , a ticket reservation system in Norway previously only used for airlines . Prices became differentiated , with prices between Oslo and Kristiansand varying between NOK 250 and 780 , depending on time of travel and class . NSB stated that they hoped to compete with airlines between the two cities , as travel time from city center to center was about the same as by plane .

 Three days before scheduled services were to start , permission to use the trains had still not been granted by the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate . The inspectorate had a series of safety concerns , including follow @-@ up on the safety terms for the wheels and axles ; lack of documentation of the crew 's training ; denying NSB 's request to have fewer inspections and less maintenance on the trains ; lack of consideration of critical events deemed to have a high probability to occur but have a low consequence ; lack of a safety inspector for operations and maintenance ; and that the trains were so heavy that they would exceed the permitted axle load of the lines . Det Norske Veritas ( DNV ) warned against a possible weakness in the axles . NSB wanted to use an expert from Deutsche Bahn to perform the necessary tests , but limited availability of the expert resulted in the Norwegian National Rail Administration granting a half @-@ year delay of the inspections . 
 On 28 October 1999 , Minister of Transport Dag Jostein <unk> asked the directors of the three involved parties , Osmund Ueland of NSB , Sverre Quale of the inspectorate and Steinar Killi of the National Rail Administration , to meet at his office the following day if the issue was not resolved . The following day , the inspectorate gave permission for the trains to be taken into use , despite noting a series of non @-@ <unk> with safety regulations : the inspectorate lacked a list of the train 's deviations from the safety regulations ; lack of a system to automatically monitor the speed of the trains , particularly when automatic train stop was disconnected ; lack of safety training for the crew ; lack of an evacuation analysis ; and lack of control of the marking of safety equipment . Most of the deviations were to be followed up within two weeks . Quale stated that the deviated issues were of a nature which had not previously been applied to trains and that it was therefore not critical . 
 The first train was delivered on 22 October and was put into use on the Sørland Line from 1 November . Scheduled travel time was reduced by 40 minutes to 3 hours and 40 minutes . In December , the trains had problems with the pantographs not working correctly in cold weather , causing the trains to lose power and be several hours delayed . NSB stated that a contributing cause was the previous year 's mild winter , which made it impossible to test the trains in extreme weather . After two and a half months of operation on the Sørland Line , every other train was at least 5 minutes late and every tenth train at least 20 minutes late . The trains also caused travel sickness , also among employees , particularly on the section from Kristiansand to Bø . NSB stated that this had also occurred on the old trains and that it was reports of the number of people affected were exaggerated . 
 On 16 December 1999 , NSB confirmed the option for another six Class 73 trains , costing NOK 680 million , for use on the Østfold Line . On 7 January 2000 , the trains were put into service on the Dovre Line between Oslo and Trondheim , and on the Sørland Line between Kristiansand and Stavanger . The travel time from Trondheim to Oslo was 5 hours and 46 minutes . In an independent marketing survey , Signatur customers were more satisfied than the customers for the two main airlines , Braathens and Scandinavian Airlines , but the train service had a lower reputation than the airlines . By May , the number of passengers on the Sørland Line had fallen by 10 percent . The reason was the limited capacity during the weekends ; while NSB had previously run trains with 400 to 500 seats , Class 73 had considerably less capacity . Additional services were introduced on the Dovre Line from 11 June 2000 , while the introduction on the Bergen Line was delayed because the infrastructure upgrades on the Bergen Line were not yet completed . 
 = = = Axle faults = = = 
 On 17 June 2000 , a Class 73 train derailed at Nelaug Station on the Sørland Line . The train was traveling at slow speed and no @-@ one was injured , but had the derailment happened at full speed , it could have been fatal . The derailment was caused by a fatigue failure in the front axle of the train . All Class 71 and 73 trains were immediately grounded , and were investigated by maintenance crews . The derailed train had recently had its axle checked for fatigue , but no cracks had been found . On 19 June , NSB stated that they had made insufficient tests during the 100 @,@ 000 @-@ kilometer ( 62 @,@ 000 mi ) controls . Class 71 had been through ultrasonic testing and were therefore allowed to resume operation the day after the accident . A DNV report from late August concluded with that the cracks had been caused by rust , which was again caused by water being sealed in by the corrosion @-@ protective layer . 
 On 23 June , Quale stated that the inspectorate should never have approved the trains . He stated that the Sørland Line was extreme in Europe in the number of curves , and that this gave increased stress on the axles . The tests which were used to approve the trains had been done on the Dovre Line and with a Class 71 set equipped with tilting technology , a class which weighs less than Class 73 . He further stated that NSB had controlled only part of the axle and that if proper tests had been made , the fatigue would have been discovered . NSB stated that they had tested the trains on a section of the Dovre Line they considered to be more curvy than the most curvy parts of the Sørland Line . There was also a misunderstanding in the approval , as NSB had said to DNV that the tests on the Dovre Line were not to be considered representative for the Sørland Line , while the inspectorate had the impression that DNV had approved the tests also for the Sørland Line . NSB stated that all tests would be done again before the trains were put back into service . 
 NSB stated that they would demand a discount from Adtranz . Following the incident , the trains would have to be in for maintenance examinations every 100 @,@ 000 kilometers ( 62 @,@ 000 mi ) , rather than every 1 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 kilometers ( 750 @,@ 000 mi ) . With each exam costing NOK 50 @,@ 000 , NSB stated that this represented an extra cost of NOK 20 million per year . The contract between Adtranz and NSB states how often trains are to be maintained , and Adtranz holds a financial responsibility if the trains systematically need more maintenance than that . By 24 June , cracks had been found in two additional units . Similar cracks had occurred in the X2 trains , but after many years of operations . The same manufacturer had been used for the axles on both trains . In Sweden impurities in the steel , combined with undersized axles , were thought to be a cause , but replacements had caused the same issues . On 26 June , NSB stated that in April they had discovered that not checking the whole axle was a weakness in the maintenance procedures , but that despite this , no new examinations had been done . The reason this was ignored , was that there was nothing that indicated that this part of the axle represented a weak point . 
 Ueland was unanimously fired as CEO by NSB 's board on 29 June . Immediately afterwards his deputy Randi Flesland resigned , after she had rejected the board 's proposal for her to become acting CEO . The same day , Adtranz assumed full responsibility for the defects , and guaranteed that they would cover NSB 's costs . In a report , Adtranz stated that the axles should be examined every 6 @,@ 000 kilometers ( 3 @,@ 700 mi ) , which would mean weekly inspections . They stated that they hoped further inquiries would find a way to have less frequent inspections . This was rejected by NSB , who would not have sufficient trains to run the schedules with such a tight inspection scheme . Instead , Adtranz and NSB agreed to a new programme which would involve inspection every three weeks . 
 The trains were put back into service on 13 July . The trains were only allowed to operate at conventional speeds and had to go through a weekly inspection . At the same time , NSB removed the surcharge on the Signatur services . NSB stated that they were considering revocation the purchase of the four trains which were still to be delivered . In addition to problems with axles , there were also issues with the braking and air conditioning systems . In mid @-@ August , the tilting mechanism was disabled on all the trains because of a fault in a bearing in the connection between the bogie and the body which allowed for a movement of several millimetres ( at least 0 @.@ 1 in ) . In late August , problems occurred with the braking system causing the trains to automatically brake even when not receiving such signals from the automatic train stop system . 
 The cause of the cracks was a rubber washer which had been installed on the first eight trains — rather than the conventional plastic cover — which was intended to protect the axles from ice and stones . Adtranz had delivered thousands of trains with the conventional method without cracks , but the washers trapped water and this caused them to corrode and crack . Adtranz had applied a coat of paint as the sole means to avoid corrosion to the axle . The DNV inspector had " hardly believed his ears " when he heard about it . In addition , the axles were undersized , and DNV stated that it was only under duress that they considered it safe to operate the trains at conventional speeds , and that all the axles would have to be replaced . On 30 August , NSB gave Adtranz two weeks to solve the axle issues unless the contract was to be revoked . 
 In mid @-@ September , the press announced that on 8 May 1996 NSB had agreed that Class 71 's axles could receive a steel quality substandard to European standard and recommendation from the International Union of Railways . The reason was that the class would have a much higher weight than planned , and that this would cause the trains to operate more slowly and thus not be able to reach the airport in the desired 19 minutes . Class 73 inherited the same axle quality from the Class 71 order . On 11 September , Adtranz accepted responsibility for the axle problems , and stated that they would replace all axles free of charge , an operation which would cost them NOK 70 million . In October , Adtranz announced that they would also replace all the wheels on both classes . NSB was spending NOK 1 @.@ 5 million on brake discs and brake shoes per month . The parties continued to disagree on the size of compensation Adtranz should give NSB , with NOK 100 million separating the two . In July , NSB replaced DNV with <unk> as their inspection supplier for the class . NSB stated that this halved the cost of the inspections . The same month , Bombardier Transportation , who by then had taken over Adtranz , stated that they were going to replace the bogie frames for all the Class 71 and 73 , as well as Class 93 trains , as part of the compensation deal with NSB . 
 = = = Bergen and Østfold = = = 
 The first of the B @-@ series trains were delivered for trial runs on 7 March 2001 . In May , NSB stated that they would never be able to operate the trains with the speeds they had previously stated they could , and that at least for the next year , the tilting trains would operate at the same speeds as conventional trains . On 17 September 2001 , the trains were put into service on the Bergen Line between Oslo and Bergen . During the following winter , the trains had problems running through snowdrift unless they were running at a sufficiently high speed . Because part of the Bergen Line had frost heave , trains were forced to drive extra slowly , causing trains to get stuck . NSB stated that tests had shown that Class 73 was better able to do this than El 16 , which had previously been the main locomotive on the line , although Class 73 did not do as well as the modern El 18 . In January 2002 , NSB started rebuilding the A @-@ series trains with a larger baggage compartment . This was largely because of insufficient space for passengers to take skis with them . 
 The B @-@ series was originally put into service on the Sørland Line between Kristiansand and Stavanger , as part of the brand Agenda . The B @-@ series had been planned for use on the Østfold Line , but because the latter is largely a commuter service with many standing passengers , the company was not comfortable using the trains there until the issues regarding the axles and wheels had been resolved . NSB also stated that they were dissatisfied with that the A @-@ series and B @-@ series were not capable of working together . The B @-@ series ' lack of a manned dining car meant that they could not be used on intercity trains , while the A @-@ series ' smaller seating capacity meant it could not be used on regional trains . The B @-@ series was put into service on the Østfold Line on 6 January 2003 . NSB stated that the new class would offer better comfort and reduce the railway 's problems from delays caused by icing . On the Østfold Line , the maximum speed is 160 km / h ( 99 mph ) . From June 2003 , NSB discontinued the brands Agenda and Signatur . The same year , NSB adjusted the timetables so that the trains look the same time as the conventional trains , and that they would use one minute more than in 1982 . Starting on 15 December , three of the services on the Østfold Line were extended to Gothenburg in Sweden . 
 On 21 February 2007 , a Class 73 derailed after hitting an avalanche between Hallingskeid and Myrdal on the Bergen Line . The accident raised questions about the class 's abilities to handle hard snow , such as in avalanches . In particular , a DNV report from 1999 had shown that the train could act as a sled , lose contact with the tracks and slide on top of the snow . A former NSB employee who worked with route planning , stated that a locomotive @-@ hauled train would be better suitable for such situations , because more of the weight is located at the front of the train , and it will therefore plow instead of slide . The National Rail Administration said that they took extra precautions for the Class 73 trains and that during snowfall they would run a snow @-@ clearing unit ahead of all Class 73 runs . NSB stated that they would consider the possibility of reverting to conventional trains , but that unless new information could shed light on the situation , they would retain use of the Class 73 trains . 
 NSB assured passengers that the trains were more capable than their reputation , and that they would continue to be used on the Bergen Line . If an alternative was needed , NSB stated that they would have to use El 18 locomotives in combination with B5 carriages . However , the carriages were at the time being used on regional rush @-@ hour trains around Oslo , were in need of renovation and did not offer the facilities required by intercity travelers . In October , NSB stated that they planned to withdraw Class 73 from service on the Bergen Line , because the use of multiple units was not flexible enough . With locomotive @-@ hauled trains , it was possible for the company to add or remove just a single carriage , but with multiple units , it was necessary to double the capacity if a single unit was insufficient . While originally planned to be introduced in 2008 , delays in the upgrades delayed the delivery of the carriages beyond 2010 . 
 On 16 June 2011 , a fire started in the snow tunnel at Hallingskeid Station on the Bergen Line . As the station is unmanned , there was no prior warning of the fire until the driver saw it from the cab just as the train entered the tunnel . More or less simultaneously , the train reached the point of the line were the fire had damaged the overhead supply . The driver immediately applied the emergency brake , which caused the train to stop 5 to 10 meters ( 16 to 33 ft ) from the fire . Because the train had no power , it was not possible to reverse out . The 257 passengers were then immediately evacuated . All personnel acted according to regulations and no @-@ one was injured in the accident . According to the driver , had he not lost the power , he would have continued through the tunnel , as the fire was just at the beginning stage . The train , which consisted of two Class 73 units , no . 10 and 13 , eventually caught fire and was damaged beyond repair . Class 73 trains are to be taken out of service on the Bergen Line from the fall of 2012 .

 Early May 2014 Dutch railway refurbishment and overhaul company <unk> announced they had won the contract to refurbish the entire fleet . The first set was to arrive in May 2014 for inspection , scheduling of the works involved and evaluation of the process while the remainder of the fleet would come in from spring 2015 . All sets were to be transported by rail via Sweden , Denmark and Germany to the main facility in Haarlem . 
 = Zytglogge = 
 The Zytglogge ( Bernese German : / ˈt ͡ <unk> / ) tower is a landmark medieval tower in Bern , Switzerland . Built in the early 13th century , it has served the city as guard tower , prison , clock tower , centre of urban life and civic memorial . 
 Despite the many redecorations and renovations it has undergone in its 800 years of existence , the Zytglogge is one of Bern 's most recognisable symbols and , with its 15th @-@ century astronomical clock , a major tourist attraction . It is a heritage site of national significance , and part of the Old City of Bern , a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site . 
 = = History = = 
 When it was built around 1218 – 20 , the Zytglogge served as the gate tower of Bern 's western fortifications . These were erected after the city 's first westward expansion following its de facto independence from the Empire . At that time , the Zytglogge was a squat building of only 16 metres ( 52 ft ) in height . When the rapid growth of the city and the further expansion of the fortifications ( up to the <unk> ) relegated the tower to second @-@ line status at around 1270 – 75 , it was heightened by 7 metres ( 23 ft ) to overlook the surrounding houses . 
 Only after the city 's western defences were extended again in 1344 – 46 up to the now @-@ destroyed <unk> , the Zytglogge was converted to a women 's prison , notably housing <unk> – " priests ' whores " , women convicted of sexual relations with clerics . At this time , the Zytglogge also received its first slanted roof . 
 In the great fire of 1405 , the tower burnt out completely . It suffered severe structural damage that required thorough repairs , which were not complete until after the last restoration in 1983 . The prison cells were abandoned and a clock was first installed above the gate in the early 15th century , probably including a simple astronomical clock and musical mechanism . This clock , together with the great bell cast in 1405 , gave the Zytglogge its name , which in Bernese German means " time bell " . 
 In the late 15th century , the Zytglogge and the other Bernese gate towers were extended and decorated after the Burgundian Romantic fashion . The Zytglogge received a new lantern ( including the metal <unk> visible today ) , four decorative corner towerlets , heraldic decorations and probably its stair tower . The astronomical clock was extended to its current state . In 1527 – 30 , the clockwork was completely rebuilt by Kaspar Brunner , and the gateway was <unk> to provide a secure foundation for the heavy machinery . 
 The Zytglogge 's exterior was repainted by Gotthard <unk> and Kaspar <unk> in 1607 – 10 , who introduced the large clock faces that now dominate the east and west façades of the tower . The corner towerlets were removed again some time before 1603 . In 1770 – 71 , the Zytglogge was renovated by Niklaus <unk> and Ludwig Emanuel Zehnder , who refurbished the structure in order to suit the tastes of the late Baroque , giving the tower its contemporary outline . 
 Both façades were again repainted in the Rococo style by Rudolf von Steiger in 1890 . The idealising historicism of the design came to be disliked in the 20th century , and a 1929 competition produced the façade designs visible today : on the west façade , Victor <unk> 's fresco " Beginning of Time " and on the east façade , a reconstruction of the 1770 design by Kurt <unk> . In 1981 – 83 , the Zytglogge was thoroughly renovated again and generally restored to its 1770 appearance . In the advent season and from Easter until the end of October , it is illuminated after dusk . 
 = = = Name = = = 
 The Bernese German Zytglogge translates to <unk> in Standard German and to time bell in English ; ' <unk> ' means ' bell ' in German , as in the related term ' glockenspiel ' . A " time bell " was one of the earliest public timekeeping devices , consisting of a clockwork connected to a hammer that rang a small bell at the full hour . Such a device was installed in the <unk> in Bern – the tower of the <unk> church which the Münster later replaced – in 1383 at the latest ; it alerted the bell @-@ ringer to ring the tower bells . 
 The name of Zytglogge was first recorded in 1413 . Previously , the tower was referred to as the <unk> ( " cage " , i.e. , prison ) and after its post @-@ 1405 reconstruction , the <unk> <unk> ( " new tower " ) . 
 = = Exterior = = 
 = = = External structure = = = 
 The Zytglogge has an overall height of 54 @.@ 5 metres ( 179 ft ) , and a height of 24 metres ( 79 ft ) up to the roof @-@ edge . Its rectangular floor plan measures 11 @.@ 2 by 10 @.@ 75 metres ( 36 @.@ 7 by 35 @.@ 3 ft ) . The wall strengths vary widely , ranging from 260 centimetres ( 100 in ) in the west , where the tower formed part of the city walls , to 65 centimetres ( 26 in ) in the east . 
 The outward appearance of the Zytglogge is determined by the 1770 renovation . Only the late Gothic cornice below the roof and the stair tower are visible artifacts of the tower 's earlier history . 
 The main body of the tower is divided into the two @-@ storey plinth , whose exterior is made of alpine limestone , and the three @-@ storey tower shaft sheathed in sandstone . The shaft 's seemingly massive corner blocks are decorative fixtures held in place by visible iron hooks . Below the roof , the cornice spans around the still @-@ visible bases of the former corner towerlets . The two @-@ story attic is covered by the sweeping , red @-@ tiled , late Gothic spire , in which two spire lights are set to the West and East . They are crowned by ornamental urns with pinecone knobs reconstructed in 1983 from 18th @-@ century drawings . 
 From atop the spire , the wooden pinnacle , copper @-@ sheathed since 1930 , rises an additional 15 metres ( 49 ft ) into the skies , crowned with a gilded knob and a weather vane displaying a cut @-@ out coat of arms of Bern . 
 = = = Bells and bell @-@ striker = = = 
 The tower 's two namesake bronze bells hang in the cupola at its very top . 
 The great hour bell , cast by Johann Reber , has remained unchanged since the tower 's reconstruction in 1405 . It has a diameter of 127 centimetres ( 50 in ) , a weight of 1 @,@ 400 kilograms ( 3 @,@ 100 lb ) and rings with a nominal tone of e ' . The inscription on the bell reads , in Latin : In the October month of the year 1405 I was cast by Master John called Reber of Aarau . I am vessel and wax , and to all I tell the hours of the day . 
 When the great bell rings out every full hour , struck by a large clockwork @-@ operated hammer , passers @-@ by see a gilded figure in full harness moving its arm to strike it . The larger @-@ than @-@ life figure of bearded Chronos , the Greek personification of time , is traditionally nicknamed Hans von <unk> by the Bernese . The wooden bell @-@ striker , which has been replaced several times , has been a fixture of the Zytglogge since the renewal of the astronomical clock in 1530 , whose clockwork also controls the figure 's motions . The original wooden Chronos might have been created by master craftsman Albrecht von Nürnberg , while the current and most recent Hans is a 1930 reconstruction of a Baroque original . The bell @-@ striker has been gilded , just like the bells , since 1770 . 
 Below the hour bell hangs the smaller quarter @-@ hour bell , also rung by a clockwork hammer . It was cast in 1887 to replace the cracked 1486 original . 
 = = = Clock faces and façade decorations = = = 
 Both principal façades , East and West , are dominated by massive <unk> . The Zytglogge 's first clockface was likely located on the plinth , but was moved up to the center of the shaft during the tower 's 15th @-@ century reconfiguration . 
 The eastern clock face features an outer ring of large golden Roman numerals , on which the larger hand indicates the hour , and an inner ring on which the smaller hand indicates the minutes . The golden sun on the hour hand is pivot @-@ mounted so that it always faces up . Below the clock face one sees an idealised profile of city founder Duke Berchtold V of Zähringen . While the exact decoration of the clockface has varied from renovation to renovation , the current ( post @-@ 1983 ) layout is generally that of 1770 . 
 The western clock face has similar hands , but is an integral part of Victor <unk> 's 1929 fresco " Beginning of Time " . The painting depicts Chronos swooping down with cape fluttering , and , below the clockface , Adam and Eve 's eviction from Paradise by an angel . 
 = = = Astronomical clock = = = 
 The dial of the Zytglogge 's astronomical clock is built in the form of an astrolabe . It is backed by a <unk> projected planisphere divided into three zones : the black night sky , the deep blue zone of dawn and the light blue day sky . The skies are crisscrossed with the golden lines of the horizon , dawn , the tropics and the temporal hours , which divide the time of daylight into twelve hours whose length varies with the time of year . 
 Around the planisphere moves the rete , a web @-@ like metal cutout representing the zodiac , which also features a Julian calendar dial . Above the rete , a display indicates the day of the week . Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork , the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February . A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac , displaying the moon phase . The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals , which run twice from I to XII . It features two suns , the smaller one indicating the date on the rete 's calendar dial . The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day . Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise , dawn , dusk and sunset . 
 The painted frieze above the astronomical clock shows five deities from classical antiquity , each representing both a day of the week and a planet in their order according to Ptolemaic cosmology . From left to right , they are : Saturn with sickle and club for Saturday , Jupiter with thunderbolts for Thursday , Mars with sword and shield for Tuesday , Venus with Cupid for Friday and Mercury with staff and bag for Wednesday . The painting of the entire clock area was refurbished in 1983 . Only the matte areas on the clock face are from the earlier coat of paint . 
 = = Movement = = 
 The clock dial has been dated to either the building phases of 1405 or 1467 @-@ 83 , or to the installation of the Brunner clockwork in 1527 @-@ 30 . <unk> <unk> notes that the planisphere uses a southern projection , as was characteristic for 15th @-@ century astronomical clocks ; all later such clocks use a northern projection . This would seem to confirm the dating of the clock to the 1405 or 1467 / 83 renovations . 
 A clock is documented in this tower since 1405 , when a new bell was installed . The city accounts of 1438 mention the repair of the clockworks . The first mention of a dial is in 1443 , and the first known image of the , much smaller first <unk> dial ( in the diary a cobbler journeyman from Ulm ) is dated 1534 . The <unk> ( <unk> ) is also documented in the same 1534 source . In the first two decades of the sixteenth century many craftsman unsuccessfully tried to improve the clockworks . The current movement was made in 1530 by clockmaker Kasper Bruner and is dated and signed by a forged nameplate . No other clockworks by this master are known . The core of the movement was forged in @-@ situ , in the very room it is still located , and the fire pit of the forge remains in the room . One of the more unusual features of the movement is that each individual tooth of the major gears is removable ( <unk> as it wears ) . Originally the movement had a verge escapement with a foliot , as it was built 127 years before the pendulum clock was invented . The Zytglogge movement was converted to a much more accurate pendulum mechanism by the French clockmaker Pierre <unk> between 1686 and 1688 . The current pendulum bob , a " recycled " iron cannonball , possibly dates from that time . The pendulum suspension is made from leather rather than using a metal spring . The weight @-@ driven movement is wound daily by hand . That task , a role known as the " <unk> " , has been held for over 25 years by the same individual . 
 = = Interior = = 
 The Zytglogge 's internal layout has changed over time to reflect the tower 's change of purpose from guard tower to city prison to clock tower . The thirteenth @-@ century guard tower was not much more than a hollow shell of walls that was open towards the city in the east . Only in the fourteenth century was a layer of four storeys inserted . 
 The rooms above the clockwork mechanism were used by the city administration for various purposes up until the late 20th century , including as archives , storerooms , as a firehose magazine and even as an air raid shelter . The interior was frequently remodelled in a careless , even <unk> fashion ; for instance , all but three of the original wooden beams supporting the intermediate floors were destroyed . Since 1979 , the tower 's interior is empty again . It is only accessed for maintenance and in the course of regular guided tours . 
 = Proteus ( video game ) = 
 Proteus is an open world exploration video game developed by Ed Key and David Kanaga for Linux , Mac OS , Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , and PlayStation Vita . The game was released on 30 January 2013 for Windows and Mac , and on 8 April 2013 for Linux . PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita versions were later released on 29 October 2013 . The game is based around adventuring and discovering an island , with no specific goals . Players explore an environment in which every creature and plant has a unique musical signature , which results in changes in audio depending on the area . The game world is procedurally generated , creating a unique layout each game . 
 Ed Key began the game 's development in 2008 and was joined by David Kanaga in 2010 ; the two aimed to make a " nontraditional and nonviolent " game . They considered different game mechanics , including quests , before settling on the final game design . Curve Studios developed the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita versions and added extra features to the Vita version at Sony 's behest . 
 Proteus won the prize for Best Audio in the 2011 Indiecade awards and was a finalist for the 2012 Independent Games Festival 's Nuovo Award . Critics received both the original and PlayStation releases well , specifically praising the game 's use of audio , though some reviewers commented negatively on the length and replayability . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In Proteus , players explore an island from a first @-@ person perspective . The island is drawn in a pixel art style and contains hills , trees , structures , and animals such as frogs and rabbits . Its layout is different each time the game is played . The focus of the game is on exploration rather than interaction , as there is no narrative and the player is given no instructions on how to proceed . Possible interactions are limited — for example , animals may run away when players come too close . The soundtrack changes depending on the player 's movements and location . It may become silent when the player is at the top of a hill or sonically dense as they travel down . The soundtrack will add extra sounds and notes when the player nears objects or animals . 
 When the game begins , players are situated away from the island and must move across an ocean of water to reach it . Upon arrival , players are free to explore all of the island during the initial season of spring . During nighttime , players can enter a cluster of lights to advance time to the next season ; going through each until the end of winter , after which the game ends . The landscape changes with the season , such as trees shedding their leaves in autumn . 
 The PlayStation Vita version lets the player directly affect the environment with the console 's rear touch panel and generate islands based on the current date and location in the real world . 
 = = Development = = 
 British developer Ed Key began work on Proteus in 2008 during his evenings and weekends . The game only neared its final form when David Kanaga joined development in 2010 . Key originally envisioned the game as a procedural role @-@ playing game in the same vein as The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion , in which the player would visit towns and complete quests . Realizing the extent of the work that would be needed for such a game , the developers decided to instead make something " nontraditional and nonviolent " . 
 Key developed the game using a game engine he had written in the C # programming language . The developers expressed interest in allowing player @-@ created mods of the game ; some such modified versions of the game have since been created by the community . After David Kanaga joined the development team as audio composer , the audio mechanics were refined through many different ideas , such as allowing players to create their own music within the game . This idea was cut because the developers felt it would detract from the exploratory emphasis of the game and turn it into more of a creative tool . 
 Proteus was released on 30 January 2013 for Windows and Mac , and on 8 April of the same year for Linux . When pre @-@ orders were open in 2012 , an Artifact Edition was also available ; a version which included a boxed version of the game with artwork , the soundtrack , and notes on the game 's development . Key apologised when the Artifact Edition was still in development and <unk> at the end of its release year , and offered to refund customers upon request . The Artifact Edition was released in July 2016 . 
 Around the time of the game 's release , Curve Studios approached , and later worked with , the developers to port the game for release on PlayStation 3 and Vita . These versions of the game use Curve Studio 's own game engine . Sony requested that new features be added to the game , though Key said that the company never attempted to steer the direction of the development of these features . Key added location and date @-@ based world generation and a way to interact with the game using the Vita 's rear touchpad . He has stated that the <unk> and date @-@ specific world generation feature could come to the other versions in the future .

 A beta version of Proteus was featured in indie game festivals and received coverage from video game journalists . It won the 2011 Indiecade Award for Best Audio , and was shortlisted for the 2012 GameCity Prize , but lost to Journey . Proteus was a finalist for the 2012 Independent Games Festival 's Nuovo Award , a prize aimed at abstract and unconventional game development , and received honorable mentions in the Excellence in Audio and Seumas McNally Grand Prize categories . The game also won the Most Amazing Indie Game prize at the 2012 A <unk> . Indie Connect Festival and in the same year was featured in the Museum of Modern Art 's " Common Senses " exhibit . 
 In an article that discussed 2011 's exploration games , Jim Rossignol of Rock , Paper , Shotgun described Proteus as " one of the most charming experiences " he had had in an indie game . In 2012 , Rick Lane of IGN stated that he found the game " delightfully intoxicating " , unique , and intriguing , and Tom Francis of PC Gamer responded positively in his game preview , drawing particular attention to the game 's changing soundtrack . 
 Proteus received generally positive reviews following release , holding aggregate scores of 80 % and 78 % on Metacritic and GameRankings respectively for the Windows PC version . Eurogamer 's Oli Welsh , PC Gamer 's Tom Senior , and IGN writer Nathan Grayson all gave the game 's changing audio praise , commenting on how it accompanied them through the game , with Grayson saying , " It 's oddly captivating to just walk around and let [ the sounds ] wash over your surroundings " . A review in Edge , though generally positive about the soundtrack , said that the music " never truly gets going " , particularly because of the lack of drums in most seasons . A Shacknews staff poll named Proteus the seventh best game of 2013 . Alice O 'Connor , writing for the website , called the game " delightfully devoid of explanation " . 
 The game 's length and replay value received mixed reactions . GameSpot 's John Robertson thought that the game had little replayability , and PC Gamer 's Senior said that the game felt very similar in subsequent playthroughs . GameTrailers ' Daniel Bloodworth , however , thought that the randomly generated islands provided an opportunity to see things players may have missed the first time and Grayson found himself replaying the game many times . 
 The PlayStation 3 and Vita versions were also received well . Mike Rose , writing for Pocket Gamer , gave the game 7 / 10 in his review . He praised the extra features present in the Vita version , though noted performance issues . In Metro 's review , Roger Hargreaves said the Vita 's version gave him more reasons to re @-@ play the game due to the addition of <unk> trophies , and PlayStation Official Magazine 's Joel Gregory called the Playstation 3 version " simple but wonderfully effective " . 
 Many players debated Proteus ' status as a video game , citing aspects such as the lack of real goals or objectives . Some called it an anti @-@ game . This description , however , was controversial . Grayson argued that Proteus does contain an action ( walking ) and a goal ( proceeding through the seasons ) . Edge 's reviewer contended that the day / night cycle , changeable weather , and a player @-@ triggered change of seasons qualified Proteus as a legitimate game . Key responded by pointing out that , while the product does include rudimentary game mechanics , interacting with them is optional and they do not usually provide feedback . However , Key went on to argue that " encouraging a strict definition of ' game ' does nothing but foster conservatism and defensiveness " .

" Pope said " Season three remains the high point for the series , producing such classics as ' No <unk> Allowed ' , ' SpongeBob Meets The Strangler ' , and ' Krusty Krab Training Video ' , a hilarious parody of industrial training videos . The one misstep is ' The Lost Episode ' [ ' The Sponge Who Could Fly ' ] , which veers too far away from Bikini Bottom and into unfunny live action territory . "

 = Keeper of the Flame ( film ) = 
 Keeper of the Flame is a 1943 Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer ( MGM ) drama film directed by George Cukor , and starring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn . 
 The screenplay by Donald Ogden Stewart is adapted from the novel Keeper of the Flame by I. A. R. Wylie . Hepburn plays the widow of a famous civic leader who has suddenly died in an accident , while Tracy portrays a former war correspondent who intends to write a flattering biography of the dead man , only to find that his death is shrouded in mystery . Screenwriter Stewart considered the script to be the finest moment of his entire career , feeling vindicated by the assignment as he believed that Hollywood had punished him for years for his political views . Principal filming began in the last week of August 1942 , four months after the release of the novel , published by Random House . The entire picture was filmed on a sound stage , with no location shooting . Hepburn had already begun her extramarital affair with Tracy , and due to his heavy drinking , she became his constant guardian during filming . 
 The film was screened for the Office of War Information 's Bureau of Motion Pictures on December 2 , 1942 , where it was disapproved of by the Bureau 's chief , Lowell <unk> . Keeper of the Flame premiered to a poor reception at Radio City Music Hall on Thursday , March 18 , 1943 . MGM head Louis B. Mayer stormed out of the cinema , enraged by his having encouraged the making of a film which equated wealth with fascism . Republican members of Congress complained about the film 's obviously leftist politics , and demanded that Will H. Hays , President of the Motion Picture Production Code , establish motion picture industry guidelines for propaganda . Cukor himself was highly dissatisfied by the film and considered it one of his poorest efforts . Nonetheless , today the film is seen more positively , with one critic concluding that Keeper of the Flame is " truly provocative in that it was one of Hollywood 's few forays into imagining the possibility of homegrown American Fascism and the crucial damage which can be done to individual rights when inhumane and tyrannical ideas sweep a society through a charismatic leader .

 When national hero Robert Forrest is killed in an riding accident , the entire United States goes into deep mourning . Admirer and renowned journalist Stephen O 'Malley ( Spencer Tracy ) returns from Europe to write a biography of the great man . Among the throngs covering the funeral , he finds his old friends and fellow reporters , Jane Harding ( Audrey Christie ) and Freddie Ridges ( Stephen McNally ) . They remain after the rest of the press leave . 
 Forrest 's widow , Christine ( Katharine Hepburn ) , refuses to speak to reporters throughout the proceedings . However , O 'Malley befriends youngster Jeb ( Darryl Hickman ) , son of the gatekeeper of the Forrest estate , Jason Rickards ( Howard Da Silva ) . The grief @-@ stricken boy shows him a way into the mansion , where he meets Christine . Though she is cordial enough , she refuses any cooperation with his biography . After O 'Malley leaves , Forrest 's private secretary , Clive Kerndon ( Richard Whorf ) , fearful of how the reporter will react to the <unk> , convinces Christine to offer her help so that they can steer him in the direction they want . 
 As time goes on , O 'Malley gains the widow 's trust . Christine is the " keeper of the flame " , protecting her husband 's memory and reputation . O 'Malley 's instincts tell him that some secret is being kept from him . He discovers that Forrest 's elderly , mentally ill mother ( Margaret Wycherly ) is living in a separate house on the vast estate . Despite her servants ' attempts to keep them apart , he manages to speak with her and obtains more clues from her ramblings . 
 O 'Malley notices " the arsenal , " a stone building near the Forrest mansion which served as Robert Forrest 's office and library . One afternoon , O 'Malley observes smoke rising from the arsenal 's chimney . When he asks Kerndon about the building 's purpose , Kerndon ( who cannot see the smoke ) tells him it is only a storehouse . O 'Malley slips away to investigate . He discovers Christine burning what she claims are love letters , but he suspects otherwise . Later , Kerndon telephones somebody and assures the unnamed party that he will take care of the situation . As O 'Malley learns more , he begins to wonder if Christine and her cousin Geoffrey Midford ( Forrest Tucker ) are lovers and murderers . However , Geoffrey 's announcement of his engagement to Rickard 's daughter , and Christine 's reaction , discounts that theory . 
 When O 'Malley admits he has fallen in love with her , Christine finally breaks down and reveals the ugly truth . Her husband was corrupted by the power and adulation he received . He became a fascist , plotting to gain control of the United States and use his enormous influence to turn Americans to fascist ideals . She shows O 'Malley papers stored in the arsenal which reveal how Forrest ( backed by secretive , ultra @-@ wealthy , power @-@ hungry individuals ) planned to use racism , anti @-@ union feeling , and antisemitism to divide the country , turning one group against another if it became too powerful to control , in order to create the chaos that would let him seize power . Christine discovered the plot the day before her husband 's death . She went riding the next morning and came upon the washed @-@ out bridge . She could have warned her husband , but decided that a " clean death in the rain was the best thing that could happen to Robert Forrest . " O 'Malley convinces her to help him write a book detailing Forrest 's scheme . 
 Kerndon eavesdrops , then locks the sole arsenal door and sets the building ablaze . Through an opening , he fatally shoots Christine with a pistol . He attempts to kill O 'Malley , too , but misses . When an automobile rushes to the scene , Kerndon shoots at the passengers and is struck by the vehicle . 
 O 'Malley ultimately writes a book titled Christine Forrest : Her Life , which exposes the plot .

 The script was based on an unpublished book by I. A. R. Wylie . RKO Pictures bought the book in outline form in April 1941 , but encountered casting difficulties and sold the rights to MGM in December 1941 for $ 50 @,@ 000 . A day or two after they had obtained the rights , MGM Vice @-@ President Eddie Mannix realized the source material was political in nature and tried to abandon the project . However , following the attack on Pearl Harbor , Mannix relented and the production went forward . Once the film went into production at MGM , the book was published by Random House in April 1942 . 
 MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer assigned the script to Donald Ogden Stewart — one of his favorite screenwriters . Mayer 's choice seemed unusual , because up to that time Stewart had written only light romantic comedies featuring wealthy East Coast socialites , but Mayer felt Stewart 's strongly leftist political leanings would enable him to chalk out a better screenplay . 
 Stewart approached the project with gusto , remarking that he " wrote an adaptation from a novel that tells about the fascist mice who are nibbling away at our country while we 're busy fighting a good war " . Stewart believed Hollywood had punished him for years for his political views , and felt vindicated by the assignment , declaring that " here was my compensation for the sabotage of my radical attempt to do my bit ... " . The script was the proudest moment of his entire career . Stewart , however , had extensive problems adapting the novel for the screen , and filming — originally due to begin in June 1942 — was delayed for several months while he worked on the screenplay . He consulted with the Bureau of Motion Pictures in the U.S. Office of War Information , an agency of the federal government created in June 1942 to promote patriotism and warn the public about domestic spying . 
 Spencer Tracy had been cast as the male lead in the film just days after MGM purchased the rights to the novel . George Cukor was chosen to direct in late April 1942 because he had dealt well with troubled and headstrong actors in the past , and Tracy was considered a difficult actor to direct . Bronisław <unk> , who had come to MGM in 1935 from Nazi Germany , was assigned to compose the film score . William H. Daniels was named the cinematographer . 
 Katharine Hepburn joined the cast in mid @-@ April 1942 after Stewart sent her a copy of the unfinished script . Hepburn was fascinated by the character of Christine , and felt that doing the film would be a way of contributing to the war effort . MGM executives did not want Hepburn attached to the picture , feeling it was an inappropriate follow @-@ up for her ( first ) previous pairing with Tracy in Woman of the Year ( 1942 ) , but Hepburn insisted , and MGM relented . Hepburn showed some concerns with Stewart 's redrafting of the script , in that he toned down the novel 's love story , placing more emphasis on the character of O 'Malley role and the action . She asked for more romance in the film . Although Hepburn had spent much of the prior year searching for scripts with equally strong male and female parts for her and Tracy , she now requested that the O 'Malley role be restored to the function it served in the novel ( where O 'Malley is impotent , troubled , and despairing of love ) and her own part expanded . Film producer Victor Saville threatened to resign if the changes were made , and Spencer Tracy supported him , which led to the changes being rejected . 
 Nonetheless , the script still had numerous problems , and Stewart refused to recognize these shortcomings . In late summer 1942 , Cukor brought in Zoë Akins , one of his favorite playwrights and screenwriters , to help with the script . Victor Saville expressed concern that Stewart was basing more and more of the script on William Randolph Hearst , one of Louis B. Mayer 's best friends , and that this might jeopardize the success of the picture . As script work continued , casting on the film ( which had been delayed months ) went ahead in mid @-@ 1942 . Richard Whorf was cast as the villain , Clive Kerndon , in early June . Frank Craven , Audrey Christie , Donald Meek and Stephen McNally were all cast in mid @-@ July . Pauline Lord was cast in late July , and Darryl Hickman added in early August . Craven , whose character was not initially specified , was given the role of Dr. Fielding in early August . Forrest Tucker and Percy Kilbride were the last members of the cast hired . Phyllis Brooks tested for a part in the film in mid @-@ June , but was not cast . A search was even made for the voice of Robert Forrest . 
 = = = Principal filming and post @-@ production = = = 
 Principal filming began the last week of August 1942 . The entire picture was filmed on a sound stage , with no location shooting . Hepburn had already begun her extramarital affair with Spencer Tracy , and the production was notorious for the ways in which Hepburn doted on Tracy . Tracy drank heavily during the shoot , and Hepburn was his constant guardian , nurse , maid , and gofer during this time . She tried to keep him out of the bars , assisted him when he was drunk , reinforced his ego , and ran lines with him . However , Hepburn continued to be upset by the script , and dealt with this problem by isolating herself from friends and family in order to concentrate on her interpretation of the role . 
 " The filming process was an efficient one , and it was going so well that in the middle of the production Cukor asked Hepburn to talk to Judy Garland in an attempt to convince Garland of the need to sober up . In order to add realism to the production , Cukor consulted reporters from United Press for advice on how newspapermen would handle Forrest 's funeral . Based on their critiques , Cukor changed the scene in the village hotel 's bar so that instead of drinking and talking about the funeral , the reporters get to work drafting articles on their typewriters . The script , too , was changed to permit the bartender to make a quip about reporters working rather than drinking . 
 Reshoots occurred in September and October . Katharine Hepburn returned to Hollywood in early September for retakes , and Pauline Lord was called back in early October . Although James E. <unk> was the film 's editor , Cukor had final cut on the film . Pauline Lord 's scenes were deleted from the picture , and her name did not appear on cast lists .

 The film was screened for the Office of War Information 's Bureau of Motion Pictures on December 2 , 1942 . The Bureau 's chief , Lowell <unk> , was unhappy with the picture and found it heavy @-@ handed . MGM promoted Spencer Tracy for an Academy Award for Best Actor but he was not nominated . 
 Keeper of the Flame premiered at New York City 's Radio City Music Hall on Thursday , March 18 , 1943 . The premiere served as a fundraiser for the Outdoor Cleanliness Association ( a group dedicated to public lighting and enforcement of trash laws ) . The premiere did not go well : MGM head Louis B. Mayer stormed out , enraged by his having encouraged the making of a film which equated wealth with fascism . It opened in Los Angeles at Grauman 's Chinese Theatre on Thursday , April 1 , 1943 . Keeper of the Flame made its Australian premiere at the Metro Theatre in Melbourne in June 1943 . It didn 't appear on American television until March 1957 .

 The film generated some political controversy . Republican members of Congress complained about the film 's obviously leftist politics , and demanded that Will H. Hays , President of the Motion Picture Production Code , establish guidelines regarding <unk> for the motion picture industry . Critical reaction at the time was mixed . While at least one reviewer felt the film was reminiscent of motion pictures like Citizen Kane and Rebecca , Hedda Hopper called it " Citizen Kane with all the art scraped off " . Bosley Crowther , writing in The New York Times , concluded that while the first half of the film was very good , the latter half felt slow and failed to deliver emotional punch . Crowther called the film " a courageous and timely drama " and praised Tracy and Hepburn for performances that featured " taut solemnity " . But the script seemed uneven dramatically ( " ... the nature of this story is a murder mystery and yet the interest is centered much more upon the dead man than on the hunt " ) , and a critical problem was that the audience " is informed much sooner than the journalist what the nature of Forrest was , and the story drags while we wait for the journalist to catch up . " Crowther still enjoyed Cukor 's direction , which he felt sustained mystery even when little existed . Like Crowther , the Chicago Tribune and other critics pointed out that the picture seemed slow . The Hartford Courant , meanwhile , raved about the film : " Hepburn and Tracy have given us a great film in Keeper of the Flame ... Great because of the courage and daring it took to make it , the magnificent production it has been given , the excellent acting within it , and the exciting , tense story it contains . " Generally speaking , the film was better received in the eastern half of the United States . 
 Cukor himself was highly dissatisfied by the film . " I suspect the story was basically fraudulent , " he told an interviewer . Like many critics , he felt that " as a piece of storytelling , the unfolding of a mystery , the first half of Keeper of the Flame is a damn good show " , but the rest of the film had substantial problems . He praised Spencer Tracy 's work , saying : " Tracy ... was at his best in the picture . <unk> , cool , he conveyed the ruthlessness of the reporter sent to investigate Forrest 's death without seeming to try . He was ideally cast in the role , grimly and skeptically exploring the secret of the dead boys ' club hero who was in fact a rampant fascist . " Hepburn , he felt , was hindered by the role and her approach to it . " It was Kate 's last romantic glamour @-@ girl part , and she acted with some of that artificiality she 'd supposedly left behind at RKO . That first scene , floating into a room in yards and yards of draperies with these lillies — well , it was all far , far too much . I don 't think I really believed in the story , it was pure <unk> , and her part was phony , <unk> . " He particularly disliked Hepburn 's entrance in the film , with the long dress and lillies . But he felt Hepburn did her best : " That 's awfully tricky isn 't it ? And doesn 't she give long , piercing looks at his portrait over the mantel ? Well . I think she finally carried a slightly phony part because her humanity asserted itself , and her humor . They always did . " Overall , though , Cukor felt the film was leaden , and that it had " a wax work quality " . Even screenwriter Stewart eventually came to feel the film was " tedious , wooden , and heavy @-@ handed " . 
 More recently , some critics have reassessed the film positively , and it has been cited as 1943 's " great emotional drama . " Critics and scholars note that the film is a good example of the type of anti @-@ fascist films produced in America early in World War II . Kevin Starr states that the film " remains astonishing in its bold effort to shape American public opinion " , and is a film which " preaches a hard @-@ line Popular Front message . " Robert Fyne , author of The Hollywood Propaganda of World War II ( 1997 ) notes the film 's " strong warning to the American people about demagoguery , domestic fascism , and mind control , while praising the virtues of freedom of the press . " One film historian has concluded that Keeper of the Flame is " truly provocative in that it was one of Hollywood 's few forays into imagining the possibility of homegrown American Fascism and the crucial damage which can be done to individual rights when inhumane and tyrannical ideas sweep a society through a charismatic leader . " Other authors have noted that the film is different from other anti @-@ fascist films of the period in that it clearly links wealth and fascism and points out the ways in which patriotism may far too easily be turned toward fascist ends . 
 The technical quality of Keeper of the Flame has been highly praised since its release . William H. Daniels ' cinematography and lighting design has been described as lush and virtuosic , and he received accolades from his peers for his work on the film . Cukor biographer and film critic Emanuel Levy praised the strong atmosphere of Keeper of the Flame and Cukor 's " interesting Gothic style " . Other historians have pointed out that the film 's score is particularly good . For example , one review noted that the music goes silent during the climactic scene in which Katharine Hepburn reveals her secrets to Spencer Tracy — an effective and unexpected emotional tactic .

He helped his team reach the Class 4A @-@ state Region II final . As a junior in baseball , Young threw a no @-@ hitter against McKinney High School in Spring 1997 . However , he missed a large part of the season after getting off to a 6 – 0 start because of a stress fracture in his foot . Nonetheless , he was already considered a top professional prospect , and he was named as one of seven Highland Park players on the all @-@ district team .

 Young was one of three rookies on the Opening Day roster . He made 31 starts in 2005 with the Rangers , compiling a 12 – 7 record with a 4 @.@ 26 ERA . His twelve victories tied Kevin Brown 's record for most wins by a Rangers rookie . His season started slowly , with seven earned runs allowed in 7 ⅓ innings pitched ( 8 @.@ 59 ERA ) over his first two starts . However , over the course of 11 starts from April 17 – June 13 , he lowered his ERA to a season @-@ low 2 @.@ 78 by going 6 – 2 , 2 @.@ 18 in 70 ⅓ innings pitched over that stretch . This included the month of May when he went 3 – 0 in five starts with a 1 @.@ 42 ERA that was third @-@ best among all qualifying major leaguers for the month . This included his season @-@ high 13 ⅔ scoreless innings recorded from May 3 – 9 . He had subsequent hot and cold streaks , with a record of 2 – 4 and a 9 @.@ 07 ERA in nine starts from June 20 – August 2 , followed by a 2 @.@ 53 ERA over his final nine starts . He closed out the season by winning his final four decisions , which was a personal best . 
 May 9 was one of two times Young came within an inning of a shutout by pitching eight scoreless innings ; August 17 against the Cleveland Indians was the other . Young recorded a personal @-@ best eight strikeouts in a seven @-@ inning no @-@ decision on June 2 at Detroit . The closest Young came to a no @-@ hitter was 5 ⅔ innings of hitless pitching in a road game against the Houston Astros on June 25 before allowing a Craig Biggio single in the sixth inning . Over the course of the season , Young was the beneficiary of the second @-@ highest run support in the majors , trailing only David Wells of the Boston Red Sox . However , he surrendered three runs or less in 22 of 31 starts .

He also tied Rangers rookie club records : wins ( 12 , Edwin Correa in 1986 and Kevin Brown in 1989 ) and pre All @-@ Star break wins ( 8 , Jeff Zimmerman in 1999 and José Guzmán in 1986 ) . Young ranked fifth among all American League pitchers with 7 @.@ 5 strikeouts per 9 innings . Despite this success , however , he was a key part of an offseason trade that also sent <unk> Sledge and Adrian Gonzalez to the San Diego Padres for starting pitcher Adam Eaton , middle reliever Akinori Otsuka and minor @-@ league catcher Billy Killian .

 2006 marked Young 's breakout season . His ERA continued its downward trend , falling to 3 @.@ 46 over 31 starts , good enough for sixth best in the National League , and he recorded a career @-@ high 169 strikeouts . He finished with an 11 – 5 record , led all major league pitchers with a 2 @.@ 41 road ERA , allowed a league @-@ leading 6 @.@ 72 hits per 9 innings pitched , and a .206 opponent batting average . During 2006 he led the majors in stolen bases allowed , with 41 . During the season , Young won a National League Pitcher of the Month award , took a no @-@ hitter into the sixth inning or beyond three times , and extended his undefeated road start streak to 24 games . This streak made Young one of only three pitchers in major league history to have gone at least 23 straight road starts without a loss ; Allie Reynolds set the record at 25 straight road starts spanning the 1948 and 1949 seasons , with Russ Meyer falling one short , going undefeated in 24 straight road contests spanning the 1953 and 1954 seasons . 
 In his first six starts after Memorial Day , he improved from a 3 – 3 with a 4 @.@ 32 ERA to 7 – 3 with a 2 @.@ 97 ERA , by allowing only four earned runs over 38 ⅔ innings . He was named one of five candidates from the National League for Major League Baseball 's " All @-@ Star Final Vote " to determine the final official selection for the 2006 Major League Baseball All @-@ Star Game ; however , Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Nomar Garciaparra was elected . Nonetheless , his strong June performance – during which he allowed 16 hits and 13 walks over 30 ⅔ innings , maintained a 1 @.@ 17 ERA and struck out 34 – earned him the National League Pitcher of the Month award . His five starts in June were highlighted by a career @-@ best 12 @-@ strikeout performance on June 9 against the Florida Marlins and a June 21 win over his former team , the Texas Rangers . 
 On September 22 , Young had a no @-@ hitter through 8 ⅓ innings of the game against the Pittsburgh Pirates before pinch hitter Joe Randa hit a two @-@ run home run . This would have been the first no @-@ hitter in Padres history . It was the first time a Padre had taken a no @-@ hitter into the ninth inning since Andy Ashby on September 5 , 1997 vs. the Atlanta Braves . Young had been on pace for a perfect game through 5 ⅔ innings . Young also took a no @-@ hitter into the eighth inning on May 30 against the Colorado Rockies as a prelude to his June performance . In that game , which marked the first time a pitcher took a no @-@ hitter into the eighth inning during the 2006 season , he surrendered a double to Brad <unk> , who had been a teammate in the 1997 Connie Mack World Series , on his first pitch of the eighth inning and 99th of the game . During Young 's next start on June 4 at Pittsburgh , he did not allow a hit for the first 5 ⅓ innings , making him one of only two pitchers ( Steve Trachsel – June 20 – 25 , 2002 ) to have consecutive starts with at least five hitless innings since the 2000 season . 
 He ended the season by winning his first career postseason start ; on October 7 , he earned a 3 – 1 victory in Game 3 of the 2006 National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals . He pitched 6 ⅔ shutout innings , struck out nine , walked two and allowed four hits . It remains the Padres ' only victory in ten post @-@ season games against the Cardinals . The Padres lost the series three games to one . Young 's 6 – 0 road performance in 2006 was one of 49 undefeated road seasons with at least five victories by a pitcher since post @-@ season play began in 1903 . However , it was the first to be followed by a postseason road victory . 
 In November , he traveled to Japan to take part in the Major League Baseball Japan All @-@ Star Series . Young was the starter in an exhibition game against the Yomiuri Giants , which was memorable for the major leaguers ' three @-@ run ninth @-@ inning rally to earn a tie . This game was the prelude to the five @-@ game series which began with three games at the Tokyo Dome and was followed by games in Osaka and Fukuoka . Young pitched the fourth game of the series . Young also blogged on behalf of <unk> about daily life during the trip . He detailed visits with United States Ambassador to Japan Tom Schieffer , time in the Harajuku , and travels on the Bullet Train .

 In his season debut on April 4 against the San Francisco Giants , Young became the 435th different pitcher to surrender a home run to Barry Bonds when he surrendered Bonds ' first of the season and <unk> of his career . The game marked Young 's 25th consecutive road start without a loss . Young was 9 – 0 during the streak , which ended in his subsequent road start on April 15 at Dodger Stadium in a 9 – 3 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers . The last of the nine other pitchers to go 20 consecutive road starts without a loss was Greg Maddux who went 22 starts without a loss during 1997 and 1998 . Young 's streak began on June 25 , 2005 . 
 On April 10 , Young signed a four @-@ year extension with the Padres through the 2010 season , reportedly worth $ 14 @.@ 5 million with a club option for 2011 . 
 On June 16 , Young threw a pitch that hit Chicago Cubs All @-@ Star first baseman Derrek Lee on the back of the upper left arm . The day before the fracas , Alfonso Soriano homered off David Wells , and the Padres believed Soriano showed poor sportsmanship by admiring and celebrating his home run . The pitch nicked Lee 's left hand near his surgically repaired wrist . When the 6 ft 5 in ( 1 @.@ 96 m ) Lee began walking towards first base , both he and Young , 6 ft 10 in ( 2 @.@ 08 m ) , exchanged words , and a bench @-@ clearing altercation ensued . Both Young and Lee were ejected from the game , along with Jake Peavy and Cubs bench coach Gerald Perry . On June 18 , Young and Lee were suspended five games each for their roles in the brawl , and Perry was suspended three games . All suspended parties were fined , as were Peavy and Brian Giles . Young and Lee appealed their suspensions , which were to begin the following day . At the time of the scuffle in the fourth inning , both pitchers were working on no @-@ hitters . Young was ejected in the game , and he earned a no @-@ decision in the game which the Padres ultimately won 1 – 0 . 
 On June 24 , Jake Peavy surrendered three earned runs in five innings , which caused his ERA to rise from 1 @.@ 98 to 2 @.@ 14 . This gave Young , who had a 2 @.@ 08 ERA , the National League @-@ leading average for one day . The next day , Brad Penny allowed only one earned run over eight innings to take the lead with a 2 @.@ 04 ERA . 
 On July 1 , Young was nominated as a candidate for the All @-@ Star Final Vote , contending against Tom <unk> , Roy Oswalt , Brandon Webb and Carlos Zambrano . In a bid for the final spot on July 4 , Young posted seven scoreless innings in a 1 – 0 victory over the Florida Marlins to not only retake the National League ERA lead , but also assume the major league lead over Brad Penny by a slim margin ( 1 @.@ <unk> to 1 @.@ <unk> ) . The voting ended on July 5 , with Young defeating the four opposing pitchers to earn his first career All @-@ Star Game selection . The selection made Young the sixth Ivy League athlete named to the All @-@ Star team ( joining Lou Gehrig , Red Rolfe , Ron Darling , Brad Ausmus and Mike Remlinger ) . 
 Young entered the All @-@ Star break with the major league lead in ERA and opponent batting average as well as an undefeated streak extending back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals . Prior to the announcement of his election , Young dropped his appeal of the five @-@ game suspension . Young served his suspension during the final four games before the All @-@ Star break and the first game afterwards , yet was allowed to play in the All @-@ Star Game at AT & T Park in San Francisco , California . In the fifth inning of the 5 – 4 American League victory for which Young was the losing pitcher , he surrendered the first inside @-@ the @-@ park home run in All @-@ Star game history to Ichiro Suzuki . 
 He was placed on the disabled list after he incurred a strained oblique muscle during the third inning of his July 24 start . On August 9 , he was activated off the disabled list to make a scheduled start . He took a 12 @-@ start ( five @-@ decision ) undefeated streak , dating back to a May 12 loss to the Cardinals , into his first start off the disabled list , but he took the loss in a 5 – 0 defeat , which was again against the Cardinals . Young ended the 2007 season as the major league leader in opponent batting average and hits per nine innings , but also in stolen bases allowed ( with 44 ) . He battled injuries late in the season and surrendered the ERA leadership to Jake Peavy in his August 30 start .

 Young started the season in the second spot in the Padres rotation between ace Peavy and Maddux . He pitched his first three turns from the second spot in the rotation . On April 18 , he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation . Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation . The number three spot in the rotation is the only one that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12 – 15 , 2008 . Young , thus , did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007 . On May 21 , 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals , Young was hit in the face by a line @-@ drive from Albert Pujols . Young was sitting on the ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on his nose . Later in the same inning , Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate . Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks . Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux , who had become a Los Angeles Dodger , earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all @-@ time list . 
 Then , on September 7 he came within four outs of perfection when Milwaukee Brewers ' Gabe Kapler hit a one @-@ out home run in the eighth inning . He allowed two hits , did not walk a batter and struck out five , en route to 10 – 1 victory at Milwaukee 's Miller Park . Young did not get his first perfect game or first no @-@ hitter , but he did end up with the first complete game of his career after 114 starts . Two starts later he hit his first home run as a major league batter .

 After starting the season with a 4 – 2 record , Young lost his last four starts before spending the remainder of the season on the disabled list . His final start occurred on June 14 . He was initially placed on the 15 @-@ day disabled list on June 19 , but on July 31 he was transferred to the 60 @-@ day disabled list .
