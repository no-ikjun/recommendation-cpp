 During the 1987 – 88 season , Sampson ( who was struggling with knee injuries that would eventually end his career prematurely ) was traded to the Golden State Warriors . The 1988 – 89 season was Olajuwon 's first full season as the Rockets ' undisputed leader . This change also coincided with the hiring of new coach Don Chaney . The Rockets ended the regular season with a record of 45 – 37 , and Olajuwon finished the season as the league leader in rebounds ( 13 @.@ 5 per game ) by a full rebound per game over Charles Barkley . This performance was consistent with his averages of 24 @.@ 8 points and 3 @.@ 4 blocks . Olajuwon posted exceptional playoff numbers of 37 @.@ 5 ppg and 16 @.@ 8 rpg , plus a record for points in a four @-@ game playoff series ( 150 ) . Nevertheless , the Rockets were eliminated in the first round by the Seattle SuperSonics , 3 games to 1 . 
 The 1989 – 90 season was a disappointment for the Rockets . They finished the season with a .500 record at 41 – 41 , and though they made the playoffs , were eliminated in four games by Los Angeles . Olajuwon put up one of the most productive defensive seasons by an interior player in the history of the NBA . He won the NBA rebounding crown ( 14 @.@ 0 per game ) again , this time by an even larger margin ; a full two rebounds per game over David Robinson , and led the league in blocks by averaging 4 @.@ 6 per game . He is the only player since the NBA started recording blocked shots in 1973 – 74 to average 14 + rebounds and 4 @.@ 5 + blocked shots per game in the same season . In doing so he joined Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar and Bill Walton as the only players in NBA history ( at that point ) to lead the league in rebounding and shot @-@ blocking in the same season . Olajuwon also recorded a quadruple @-@ double during the season , becoming only the third player in NBA history to do so . 
 The Rockets finished the 1990 – 91 season with a record of 52 – 30 under NBA Coach of the Year Chaney . Olajuwon averaged 21 @.@ 8 points per game in 1990 – 91 , but due to an injury to his <unk> caused by an elbow from Bill Cartwright , did not play in enough games ( 56 ) to qualify for the rebounding title . Otherwise he would have won it for a third consecutive year , averaging 13 @.@ 8 a game ( league leader Robinson averaged 13 @.@ 0 rpg ) . He also averaged a league @-@ leading 3 @.@ 95 blocks per game . However , the Rockets were swept in the playoffs by the LA Lakers . 
 The following season was a low point for the Rockets during Olajuwon 's tenure . They finished 42 – 40 , and missed the playoffs for the first time in Olajuwon 's career . He missed two weeks early in the season due to an accelerated heart beat . Despite his usual strong numbers , he could not lift his team out of mediocrity . Since making the Finals in 1986 , the Rockets had made the playoffs five times , but their record in those playoff series was 1 – 5 and they were eliminated in the first round four times . Following the season , Olajuwon requested a trade in part because of his bad contract ; his salary was considerably low for a top center , and his contract specifically forbade re @-@ negotiation . He also expressed displeasure with the organization 's efforts to surround him with quality players . He felt the Rockets had cut corners at every turn , and were more concerned with the bottom line than winning . Management had also infuriated Olajuwon during the season when they accused of him of faking a hamstring injury because of his unhappiness over his contract situation . His agent cited his differences with the organization as being " irreconcilable " , and Olajuwon publicly insulted owner Charlie Thomas and the team 's front office . With the 1992 – 93 season approaching , a reporter for the Houston Chronicle said that Olajuwon being dealt was " as close to a sure thing as there is . " 
 Nonetheless he was not traded and the Rockets began the season with a new coach , Rudy Tomjanovich . Olajuwon improved his passing in 1992 – 93 , setting a new career high of 3 @.@ 5 assists per game . This willingness to pass the ball increased his scoring , making it more difficult for opposing teams to double and triple @-@ team him . Olajuwon set a new career high with 26 @.@ 1 points per game . The Rockets set a new franchise record with 55 wins , and advanced to the second round of the playoffs , pushing the Seattle SuperSonics to a seventh game before losing in overtime , 103 – 100 . He finished second in the MVP race to Charles Barkley with 22 votes to Barkley 's 59 . The team rewarded him with a four @-@ year contract extension toward the end of the regular season . In stark contrast to the previous year , the Rockets entered the 1993 – 94 season as a team on the rise . They had a solid core of young players and veterans , with a leader in Olajuwon who was entering his prime . 
 = = = = Championship years = = = = 
 Olajuwon gained a reputation as a clutch performer and also as one of the top centers in history based on his performances in the 1993 – 94 and 1994 – 95 seasons . He outplayed centers such as Patrick Ewing , David Robinson , Shaquille O 'Neal , and Dikembe Mutombo , and other defensive stalwarts such as Dennis Rodman and Karl Malone . Many of his battles were with his fellow Texas @-@ based rival David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs . In the 30 head – to – head match @-@ ups during the seven seasons from the 1989 to 1996 , when both Olajuwon and Robinson were in their prime , Olajuwon averaged 26 @.@ 3 points per game , shooting 47 @.@ 6 % from the field , while Robinson averaged 22 @.@ 1 and 46 @.@ 8 % . 
 In 1993 Michael Jordan retired from basketball , dealing a blow to the Bulls dynasty that had just won three consecutive championships . In his absence , Olajuwon led the Rockets to a championship in the 1994 NBA Finals in a seven @-@ game series against the New York Knicks , the team of one of Olajuwon 's perennial rivals since his collegiate days , Patrick Ewing . After being down 2 – 1 , the Knicks took a 3 – 2 lead into Game 6 . The Rockets were defending an 86 – 84 lead when in the last second , Knicks guard John Starks ( who had already scored 27 points ) went up for a finals @-@ winning three . Olajuwon pulled off a clutch play by blocking the shot as time expired . In Game 7 , Olajuwon posted a game – high 25 points and 10 rebounds , which helped defeat the Knicks , bringing the first professional sports championship to Houston since the Houston Oilers won the American Football League championship in 1961 . Olajuwon dominated Ewing in their head – to – head match @-@ up , outscoring him in every game of the series and averaging 26 @.@ 9 points per game on 50 % shooting , compared to Ewing 's 18 @.@ 9 and 36 @.@ 3 % . For his efforts Olajuwon was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player . 
 Olajuwon was at the pinnacle of his career . In 1994 he became the only player in NBA history to win the MVP , Finals MVP and Defensive Player of the Year awards in the same season . He was also the first foreign @-@ born player to win the league 's MVP award . 
 Despite a slow start by the team , and Olajuwon missing eight games toward the end of the season with anemia , the Rockets repeated as champions in 1995 . They were bolstered in part by the acquisition of Clyde Drexler , Olajuwon 's former University of Houston " Phi Slama Jama " teammate , in a mid @-@ season trade from the Portland Trail Blazers . Olajuwon averaged 27 @.@ 8 points , 10 @.@ 8 rebounds , and 3 @.@ 4 blocks per game during the regular season . Olajuwon displayed perhaps the most impressive moments of his career during the playoffs . San Antonio Spurs center David Robinson , recently crowned league MVP , was outplayed by Olajuwon in the Conference Finals : Olajuwon averaged 35 @.@ 3 points on .560 shooting ( Robinson 's numbers were 23 @.@ 8 and <unk> ) and outscored Robinson 81 – 41 in the final two games . When asked later what a team could do to " solve " Olajuwon , Robinson told LIFE magazine : " Hakeem ? You don 't solve Hakeem . " The Rockets won every road game that series . In the NBA Finals , the Rockets swept the Orlando Magic , who were led by a young Shaquille O 'Neal . Olajuwon outscored O 'Neal in every game , scoring more than 30 points in each and raising his regular @-@ season rate by five while O 'Neal 's production dropped by one . Olajuwon was again named Finals MVP . He averaged 33 @.@ 0 points on .531 shooting , 10 @.@ 3 rebounds , and 2 @.@ 81 blocks in the 1995 Playoffs . As in 1994 , Olajuwon was the only Rockets All @-@ Star . 
 = = = = Post @-@ championship period = = = = 
 The Rockets ' two @-@ year championship run ended when they were eliminated in the second round of the 1996 NBA Playoffs by the eventual Western Conference Champion Seattle SuperSonics . Michael Jordan had returned from an 18 @-@ month hiatus in March 1995 , and his Chicago Bulls dominated the league for the next three years ( 1996 – 98 ) . The Bulls and Rockets never met in the NBA Playoffs . The Rockets posted a 57 – win season in 1996 – 97 season when they added Charles Barkley to their roster . They started the season 21 – 2 , but lost the Western Conference Finals in six games to the Utah Jazz . After averaging 26 @.@ 9 and 23 @.@ 2 points in 1995 – 96 and 1996 – 97 respectively , Olajuwon 's point production dipped to 16 @.@ 4 in 1997 – 98 . After the Rockets lost in the first round in five games to the Jazz in 1998 , Drexler retired . In 1998 – 99 the Rockets acquired veteran All @-@ Star Scottie Pippen and finished 31 – 19 in the lockout @-@ shortened regular season . Olajuwon 's scoring production rose to 18 @.@ 9 points per game , and he made his twelfth and final All @-@ NBA Team . However , they lost in the first round again , this time to the Lakers . After the season , Pippen was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers . 
 = = = Toronto Raptors = = = 
 Houston began to rebuild , bringing in young guards Cuttino Mobley and 2000 NBA co @-@ Rookie of the Year Steve Francis . On August 2 , 2001 , after refusing a $ 13 million deal with the Rockets , Olajuwon was traded to the Toronto Raptors for draft picks ( the highest of which was used by Houston to draft <unk> <unk> at # 15 in the 2002 NBA Draft ) , with the player having a three @-@ year contract that would give him $ 18 million . Olajuwon averaged career lows of 7 @.@ 1 points and 6 @.@ 0 rebounds per game in what would be his final season in the NBA , as he decided to retire in the fall of 2002 , due to a back injury . Olajuwon retired as the all – time league leader in total blocked shots with 3 @,@ 830 , although shot blocking did not become an official statistic until the 1973 – 74 NBA season . Shortly after his retirement , his # 34 jersey was retired by the Rockets . 
 = = National team career = = 
 In 1980 , before arriving in the US , Olajuwon played for a Nigerian junior team in the All @-@ Africa Games . This created some problems when he tried to play for the United States men 's national basketball team initially . FIBA rules prohibit players from representing more than one country in international competition , and players must go through a three @-@ year waiting period for any nationality change . Olajuwon was ineligible for selection to the " Dream Team " as he hadn 't become a US citizen . 
 Olajuwon became a naturalized American citizen on April 2 , 1993 . For the 1996 Olympics , he received a FIBA exemption and was eligible to play for Dream Team III . The team went on to win the gold medal in Atlanta . During the tournament , he shared his minutes with Shaquille O 'Neal and David Robinson . He played 7 out of the 8 games and started 2 . He averaged 5 points and 3 @.@ 1 rebounds and had 8 assists and 6 steals in seven games . 
 = = Player profile = = 
 If I had to pick a center [ for an all @-@ time best team ] , I would take Olajuwon . That leaves out Shaq , Patrick Ewing . It leaves out Wilt Chamberlain . It leaves out a lot of people . And the reason I would take Olajuwon is very simple : he is so versatile because of what he can give you from that position . It 's not just his scoring , not just his rebounding or not just his blocked shots . People don 't realize he was in the top seven in steals . He always made great decisions on the court . For all facets of the game , I have to give it to him . 
 Olajuwon was highly skilled as both an offensive and defensive player . On defense , his rare combination of quickness and strength allowed him to guard a wide range of players effectively . He was noted for both his outstanding shot @-@ blocking ability and his unique talent ( for a frontcourt player ) for stealing the ball . Olajuwon is the only player in NBA history to record more than 200 blocks and 200 steals in the same season . He averaged 3 @.@ 09 blocks and 1 @.@ 75 steals per game for his career . He is the only center to rank among the top ten all time in steals . Olajuwon was also an outstanding rebounder , with a career average of 11 @.@ 1 rebounds per game . He led the NBA in rebounding twice , during the 1989 and 1990 seasons . He was twice named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year , and was a five @-@ time NBA All @-@ Defensive First Team selection . 
 On offense , Olajuwon was famous for his deft shooting touch around the basket and his nimble footwork in the low post . With the ball , Hakeem displayed a vast array of fakes and spin moves , highlighted in his signature " Dream Shake " ( see below ) . He was a prolific scorer , averaging 21 @.@ 8 points per game for his career , and an above average offensive rebounder , averaging 3 @.@ 3 offensive rebounds per game . Additionally , Olajuwon became a skilled dribbler with an ability to score in " face @-@ up " situations like a perimeter player . He is 1 of only 4 players to have recorded a quadruple @-@ double in the NBA . It should be noted that quadruple @-@ doubles were not possible before the 1973 – 74 season , when blocked shots and steals were first kept as statistics in the NBA . 
 = = = Dream Shake = = = 
 " The best footwork I ’ ve ever seen from a big man " 
 — Pete Newell 
 Olajuwon established himself as an unusually skilled offensive player for a big man , perfecting a set of fakes and spin moves that became known as his trademark Dream Shake . Executed with uncanny speed and power , they are still regarded as the pinnacle of " big man " footwork . Shaquille O 'Neal stated : " Hakeem has five moves , then four <unk> – that gives him 20 moves . " Olajuwon himself traced the move back to the soccer @-@ playing days of his youth . " The Dream Shake was actually one of my soccer moves which I translated to basketball . It would accomplish one of three things : one , to misdirect the opponent and make him go the opposite way ; two , to freeze the opponent and leave him devastated in his tracks ; three , to shake off the opponent and giving him no chance to contest the shot . " The Dream Shake was very difficult to defend , much like Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar 's sky @-@ hook . 
 One notable Dream Shake happened in Game 2 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs . With David Robinson guarding him , Olajuwon performed a cross @-@ over , drove to the basket and faked a layup . Robinson , an excellent defender , kept up with Olajuwon and remained planted . Olajuwon spun counterclockwise and faked a jump shot . Robinson , who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP , fell for the fake and jumped to block the shot . With Robinson in the air , Olajuwon performed an up @-@ and @-@ under move and made an easy layup . 
 Olajuwon has referred to basketball as a science , and described his signature move in vivid detail : " When the point guard throws me the ball , I jump to get the ball . But this jump is the set @-@ up for the second move , the baseline move . I call it the ' touch landing . ' The defender is waiting for me to come down because I jumped but I ’ m gone before I land . Defenders say ' Wow , he ’ s quick , ' but they don ’ t know that where I ’ m going is predetermined . He ’ s basing it on quickness , but the jump is to set him up . Before I come down , I make my move . When you jump , you turn as you land . Boom ! The defender can ’ t react because he ’ s waiting for you to come down to defend you . Now , the first time when you showed that quickness , he has to react to that quickness , so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook . All this is part of the Dream Shake . The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump ; now you don ’ t have a pivot foot . When I dribble I move it so when I come here , I jump . By jumping , I don ’ t have a pivot foot now . I dribble so now I can use either foot . I can go this way or this way . So he ’ s frozen , he doesn ’ t know which way I ’ m going to go . That is the shake . You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot . He doesn ’ t know where you ’ re gonna turn and when . "

 Olajuwon married his current wife Dalia <unk> on August 8 , 1996 in Houston . They have two daughters , Rahmah and Aisha Olajuwon . Abisola Olajuwon , his daughter with Lita Spencer , whom he met in college , represented the West Girls in the McDonald 's All American Game and played in the WNBA . 
 In addition to English , Olajuwon is fluent in French , Arabic , and the Nigerian languages of Yoruba and <unk> . He wrote his autobiography , Living the Dream , with co @-@ author Peter <unk> in 1996 . During his 18 @-@ year NBA career , Olajuwon earned more than $ 107 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in salary . 
 Olajuwon , who earlier in his career signed a shoe endorsement deal with LA Gear , later became the face of Spalding 's athletic shoe line and endorsed The Dream , a sneaker that retailed in various outlets ( such as Payless ShoeSource ) for $ 34 @.@ 99 . This made him one of the very few well @-@ known players in any professional sport to endorse a sneaker not from Nike , Reebok , Adidas , or other high @-@ visibility retail brands . As Olajuwon declared : " How can a poor working mother with three boys buy Nikes or <unk> that cost $ 120 ? ... She can 't . So kids steal these shoes from stores and from other kids . Sometimes they kill for them . " 
 = = = Higher education = = = 
 Attending college was also an important priority to Olajuwon . At the University of Houston , Olajuwon was a physical education major . 
 = = = Muslim faith = = = 
 In Olajuwon 's college career and early years in the NBA , he was often undisciplined , talking back to officials , getting in minor fights with other players and amassing technical fouls . Later , Olajuwon took an active interest in spirituality , becoming a more devout Muslim . On March 9 , 1991 , he altered his name from Akeem to the more conventional spelling of Hakeem , saying , " I 'm not changing the spelling of my name , I 'm correcting it " . He later recalled , " I studied the Qur 'an every day . At home , at the mosque ... I would read it in airplanes , before games and after them . I was soaking up the faith and learning new meanings each time I turned a page . I didn 't dabble in the faith , I gave myself over to it . " " His religion dominates his life " , Drexler said in 1995 . Olajuwon was still recognized as one of the league 's elite centers despite his strict observance of Ramadan ( i.e. , abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours for about a month ) , which occurred during the playing season throughout his career . Olajuwon was noted as sometimes playing better during the month , and in 1995 he was named NBA Player of the Month in February , even though Ramadan began on February 1 of that year . 
 = = Post @-@ NBA life = = 
 Olajuwon played for 20 consecutive seasons in Houston , first collegiately for the Cougars and then the Rockets . He is considered a local icon and one of Houston 's most beloved athletes . Olajuwon has had great success in the Houston real estate market , with his estimated profits exceeding $ 100 million . He buys in cash @-@ only purchases , as it is against Islamic law to pay interest . Olajuwon splits his time between Jordan , where he moved with his family to pursue Islamic studies , and his ranch near Houston . 
 In the 2006 NBA offseason , Olajuwon opened his first Big Man Camp , where he teaches young frontcourt players the finer points of playing in the post . While Olajuwon never expressed an interest in coaching a team , he wishes to give back to the game by helping younger players . When asked whether the league was becoming more guard @-@ oriented and big men were being de @-@ emphasized , Olajuwon responded , " For a big man who is just big , maybe . But not if you play with speed , with agility . It will always be a big man 's game if the big man plays the right way . On defense , the big man can rebound and block shots . On offense , he draws double @-@ teams and creates opportunities . He can add so much , make it easier for the entire team . " He runs the camp for free . Olajuwon has worked with several NBA players , including power forward Emeka Okafor , and center Yao Ming . In September , 2009 , he also worked with Kobe Bryant on the post moves and the Dream Shake . More recently he has been working with Dwight Howard , helping him diversify his post moves and encouraging more mental focus . In the 2011 offseason , LeBron James flew to Houston and spent time working with Olajuwon . Olajuwon has also worked with Ömer Aşık , Donatas <unk> , Amar 'e Stoudemire , Carmelo Anthony , JaVale McGee and Kenneth <unk> . 
 Olajuwon was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a member of the class of 2008 . On April 10 , 2008 the Rockets unveiled a sculpture in honor of him outside the Toyota Center . 
 Olajuwon attended the 2013 NBA Draft to bid farewell to retiring commissioner David Stern as Stern made his announcement for the final pick of the first round . Olajuwon was the first pick announced by Stern back in 1984 . 
 On August 1 , 2015 , Olajuwon made a special appearance for Team Africa at the 2015 NBA Africa exhibition game . He became a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2016 .

 = HMS Greyhound ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Greyhound was a G @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the 1930s . Greyhound participated in the Norwegian Campaign in April 1940 , the Dunkirk evacuation in May and the Battle of Dakar in September before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in November . The ship generally escorted the larger ships of the Mediterranean Fleet as they protected convoys against attacks from the Italian Fleet . She sank two Italian submarines while escorting convoys herself in early 1941 . Greyhound was sunk by German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers north @-@ west of Crete on 22 May 1941 as she escorted the battleships of the Mediterranean Fleet attempting to intercept the German sea @-@ borne invasion forces destined for Crete . 
 = = Description = = 
 Greyhound displaced 1 @,@ 350 long tons ( 1 @,@ 370 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 883 long tons ( 1 @,@ 913 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 323 feet ( 98 @.@ 5 m ) , a beam of 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 5 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 34 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 25 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers . Greyhound carried a maximum of 470 long tons ( 480 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 5 @,@ 530 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 240 km ; 6 @,@ 360 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime , but in increased to 146 in wartime . 
 The ship mounted four 45 @-@ calibre 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) Mark IX guns in single mounts . For anti @-@ aircraft defence Greyhound had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began . 
 = = Service = = 
 Greyhound was laid down by Vickers Armstrong Naval Construction Works at Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness on 20 September 1934 , launched on 15 August 1935 and completed on 31 January 1936 . Excluding government @-@ furnished equipment like the armament , the ship cost £ 248 @,@ 768 . Aside from a brief period when she was assigned to the 20th Destroyer Flotilla after her commissioning , Greyhound spent the prewar period assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet . She was refitted at Portsmouth Dockyard between 7 June and 23 July 1938 and escorted the ocean liner SS Strathnaver between Malta and Alexandria during the Munich Crisis in September 1938 . She then escorted the light cruiser Arethusa on her voyage to Aden . 
 Greyhound and her entire flotilla were transferred to the Western Approaches Command at Plymouth in October . On 12 November she collided with her sister ship , Gipsy en route to Harwich , and her new assignment with the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla , but she was only slightly damaged and her repairs were completed two days later . The ship rescued survivors on 18 November from the ocean liner SS Simon Bolivar , which had struck a mine and from SS <unk> the following day . Greyhound began escorting coastal convoys on 5 December when she was transferred back to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla . On 14 January she captured the German blockade runner Phaedra in the North Sea . The ship was refitted between 16 February and 18 March 1940 and later reassigned to the Home Fleet . 
 On 5 April Greyhound escorted the battlecruiser Renown as she covered the minelayers preparing to implement Operation Wilfred , an operation to lay mines in the Vestfjord to prevent the transport of Swedish iron ore from Narvik to Germany . The ship was present during , but played no part in , Renown 's brief engagement with the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau on 9 April . Greyhound remained in the Vestfjord when the five ships of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla sailed into the Ofotfjord on 10 April to engage the German ships that had transported the invasion force to Narvik . She covered the withdrawal of the three surviving destroyers later that day . The ship was damaged by German bombers at Scapa Flow on 18 April and was repaired at Gravesend , Kent between 22 April and 19 May . 
 During the Siege of Calais , Greyhound and her sister Grafton provided naval gunfire support for the 30th Motor Brigade on 25 and 26 May . On 28 and 29 May she evacuated 1360 men from Dunkirk before she was damaged by German bombers . The ship was towed out of the harbour by the Polish destroyer ORP <unk> . After her repairs were completed at Chatham Dockyard on 17 June , Greyhound rejoined her flotilla at Dover . On 30 July the ship , and her sister Gallant , escorted the aircraft carrier Argus to Gibraltar and Greyhound was assigned to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla based there . The ship participated in Operations Hats at the end of August when the British reinforced the Mediterranean Fleet . 
 During the Battle of Dakar on 23 September , Greyhound , the destroyer Fury , and the Australian heavy cruiser HMAS Australia engaged the Vichy French destroyer L <unk> which was set on fire and forced to beach itself . The ship escorted the battleship Barham and the cruisers Berwick and Glasgow during Operation Coat in early November as they joined the Mediterranean Fleet . Greyhound herself was transferred to the 14th Destroyer Flotilla in Alexandria . She participated in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November during Operation Collar . 
 Greyhound participated in Operation Excess in January 1941 and then sank the Italian submarine <unk> on 19 January while escorting a convoy to Piraeus . In late January , the ship , and the destroyers Juno , Jervis , and Janus , escorted the badly damaged aircraft carrier Illustrious from Malta to Alexandria . Greyhound sank the Italian submarine <unk> on 6 March as she attempted to attack Convoy <unk> which was carrying British troops to Greece . The ship escorted the capital ships of the Mediterranean Fleet during the Battle of Cape Matapan on 28 / 29 March and initiated the night action when her searchlight illuminated an Italian cruiser . Greyhound and her sister , Griffin , attacked some of the Italian destroyers , but lost them when they passed through their own smokescreen . She sank the Italian sailing ship Romagna on 17 April off Apollonia , Cyrenaica as she was conducting an anti @-@ shipping sweep off the North African coast with the Australian destroyer HMAS Vendetta . The ship escorted the heavy units of the Mediterranean Fleet on 6 May as they provided cover for Operation Tiger , a convoy carrying reinforcements to Egypt . During the invasion of Crete , Greyhound escorted the battleship Warspite west of Crete on 22 May as she covered the cruiser forces attempting to sink the German invasion convoys . The ships were en route to rendezvous with the cruisers in the <unk> Strait when she was struck by three bombs dropped by Stukas of StG 2 and sank a few minutes afterwards .

 Maggie Roswell was born and raised in Los Angeles , California . After going to Catholic school and Los Angeles City College , she began a career in acting . In the 1970s she made some guest appearances on television shows such as M * A * S * H , but she did not get her first big acting roles until the 1980s . In the 1980 film Midnight Madness , she played a character that leads a group of sorority sisters who are participating in a college puzzle solving race . Roswell also starred in the sketch comedy The Tim Conway Show in 1980 and 1981 . In 1985 she appeared in the film Lost in America as the character Patty , and she had a supporting role in the 1986 film Pretty in Pink . She also acted in the two @-@ part television film The Deliberate Stranger . In addition , Roswell played some minor roles in television shows in the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s , including guest appearances on Remington Steele ( 1983 ) , Masquerade ( 1984 ) , Happy Days ( 1984 ) , Murphy Brown ( 1993 ) , and Quantum Leap ( 1993 ) . She was offered a chance to replace Gilda Radner on Saturday Night Live , but turned down the offer when her agent told her " the show wasn 't going anywhere . " 
 Roswell also did theater . In 1986 she appeared in improvisatory shows directed by Paul Sills at Lamb 's Theatre , in which the actors were given characters and situations by the audience members . In 1988 she had a role in Julia Sweeney 's play Mea 's Big Apology at Groundling Theatre in Los Angeles . She played Eunice , a cynical woman who works at a malpractice insurance company and is a colleague to the main character . The company people do everything they can to dismiss her because they do not want to pay her retirement benefits , which are about to take effect . Roswell reprised this role in a 1992 revival of the play , also at Groundling Theatre .

 In addition to her live action roles , Roswell did some voice acting in animated films and shows , including the voice of <unk> in Fire and Ice from 1983 . This led to her being hired on the animated television series The Simpsons in 1989 . Her first appearance was in the season one episode " Homer 's Night Out " , in which she voiced the character Princess Kashmir ( a belly dancer who seduces Homer ) . Out of the total thirteen episodes of the first season , Roswell appeared in four ; however , they were only minor roles . Roswell did not become a regular cast member until the middle of the second season in the episode " Dead Putting Society " ( 1990 ) , with the introduction of Maude Flanders ( neighbor to the Simpson family and the loving wife of Ned Flanders ) . Roswell went on to voice other recurring characters on the show , such as Helen Lovejoy ( the reverend 's wife ) , Miss Hoover ( an elementary school teacher ) , and Luann Van Houten ( a housewife and mother ) , as well as several more one @-@ time characters and background characters . Fellow Simpsons cast member Nancy Cartwright wrote in her autobiography that " Maggie has been blessed with a skill in creating one of the hardest things to create : the ' normal sound , ' whatever that is . So she can easily slip into the gal next door or any number of assorted reporters , medical students , jury members , accountants , scientists and moms . " Roswell was nominated for an Emmy Award for her work on The Simpsons . She also received a 1997 Annie Award nomination in the category " Best Individual Achievement : Voice Acting by a Female Performer in a TV Production " for her role as <unk> Bobbins in the episode " Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala ( Annoyed Grunt ) cious " , but lost to June Foray . 
 Roswell met fellow voice actor Hal Rayle in 1986 , and they married in 1987 . He had done roles such as Predator in Predator 2 , the <unk> in Ghoulies II , and Marvin the Martian in Air Jordan commercials . They moved from Los Angeles to Denver , Colorado , in June 1994 to raise their adopted daughter Spenser , who was born in 1993 . Between March and November every year , when episodes of The Simpsons were being recorded , Roswell had to fly back to Los Angeles twice a week to attend the table reads and the recording sessions . In an article about her and her husband 's move , Ricky Lopes of Rocky Mountain News wrote : " When The Simpsons is taping , she goes to Los Angeles every Friday morning for the first reading , flies back that afternoon , flies back Sunday to tape the show Monday and flies back home that night . " Roswell said she " got the idea for the way Helen Lovejoy says ' B @-@ bye , b @-@ bye , b @-@ bye , ' to everybody when they leave the church from the way the flight attendants say it when you get off the plane . " 
 Roswell and Rayle began writing , producing , and / or voicing advertisements together for companies . They established " The Roswell ' n ' Rayle Company " for this purpose , and built a recording studio in their basement . In 1994 , they did radio advertisements in Denver for Burger King , Christy Sports , and an insect exhibit at the Museum of Natural History . The same year , Roswell provided her voice for Campbell 's Soup and Pontiac commercials as part of their business . The company is still active as of 2010 . They are now also providing comedic ring tones . 
 In 1997 , Roswell appeared in the film Switchback alongside Danny Glover and Dennis Quaid . 
 Roswell left The Simpsons in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with Fox Broadcasting Company , which airs The Simpsons . The dispute was not revealed to the press at first ; Fox originally reported that she decided to quit only because she was tired of flying between Denver and Los Angeles for the recording sessions . It was then announced by Roswell that she had asked for a raise , not only because she was tired of the traveling , but because of the increasing cost of flight tickets . Roswell was paid $ 1 @,@ 500 to $ 2 @,@ 000 per episode during the three seasons before she left , and she asked Fox for a raise to $ 6 @,@ 000 per episode . However , Fox only offered her a $ 150 raise , which did not even cover the travel costs , so she decided to quit . Roswell told The Denver Post that " they offered me a $ 150 raise . I mean , that 's lint in Fox 's pocket . But Fox wanted to prove a point , I guess . I was flying myself back and forth from Denver to L.A. It was exhausting . I loved doing the show and they thought that I would come back . But now I 'm busy doing other things . " She further added that " I was part of the backbone of The Simpsons and I don 't think the money I asked for was exorbitant . I wasn 't asking for what other cast members make . I was just trying to recoup all the costs I had in travel . If they 'd flown me in , I 'd still be working . " At that point , the six main cast members of the show were paid $ 125 @,@ 000 per episode . As a result of Roswell 's departure , the Maude Flanders character was killed off in the episode " Alone Again , Natura @-@ Diddily " . Voice actress Marcia Mitzman Gaven was hired to fill in for Roswell 's other characters .

 Roswell returned to The Simpsons in 2002 in the season premiere of the fourteenth season , in which Maude made an appearance as a ghost . She reached a deal with Fox to record her lines from her Denver home and thus the dispute ended . Roswell has since stayed on the show , which is still airing . She also appeared as Helen Lovejoy in the 2007 film The Simpsons Movie . She attended the gala premiere together with her daughter , Spenser Rayle , who had turned fourteen years old at the time . Roswell told The Denver Post that she was surprised she was given two tickets ; " Everybody in Hollywood is killing to get their kid there . My daughter 's big thrill is to meet [ the band ] Green Day , " which also appeared in the film . 
 In 2004 , Roswell had a minor role in the film Silver City . In 2009 , she starred in the play Bunny Bunny : Gilda Radner , a Sort of Romantic Comedy at Avenue Theater in Denver . It opened in May of that year . The play recounted events in the career of actress Gilda Radner , who Roswell played , from 1975 ( the start of Saturday Night Live ) to her death in 1989 . 
 Outside her acting career , Roswell likes to sing . On February 7 , 1999 , she debuted as a nightclub singer at the Denver Chop House & Brewery , where she performed on behalf of the homelessness charity Family Homestead . In June 2003 , she sang at Denver 's <unk> Theatre on Sunday nights with The Sirens .

 = Homophony = 
 In music , homophony ( / <unk> , <unk> , <unk> / ; Greek : <unk> , <unk> , from <unk> , <unk> , " same " and <unk> , <unk> , " sound , tone " ) is a texture in which a primary part is supported by one or more additional strands that flesh out the harmony and often provide rhythmic contrast . This differentiation of roles contrasts with equal @-@ voice polyphony ( in which similar lines move with rhythmic and melodic independence to form an even texture ) and monophony ( in which all parts move in unison or octaves ) . Historically , homophony and its differentiated roles for parts emerged in tandem with tonality , which gave distinct harmonic functions to the soprano , bass and inner voices . 
 A homophonic texture may be <unk> , which means that all parts have the same rhythm . Chorale texture is another variant of homophony . The most common type of homophony is melody @-@ dominated homophony , in which one voice , often the highest , plays a distinct melody , and the accompanying voices work together to articulate an underlying harmony . 
 Initially , in Ancient Greece , homophony indicated music in which a single melody is performed by two or more voices in unison or octaves , i.e. monophony with multiple voices . Homophony as a term first appeared in English with Charles Burney in 1776 , emphasizing the concord of harmonized melody . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = European and German music = = = 
 Homophony first appeared as one of the predominant textures in Western music during the Baroque period in the early 17th century , when composers began to commonly compose with vertical harmony in mind , the homophonic basso continuo becoming a definitive feature of the style . The choral arrangement of four voices ( soprano , alto , tenor , and bass ) has since become common in Western music . Homophony began by appearing in sacred music , replacing polyphony and monophony as the dominant form , but spread to secular music , for which it is one of the standard forms today . 
 In 20th century classical music some of the " triad @-@ oriented accompanimental figures such as the Alberti bass [ a homophonic form of accompaniment ] have largely disappeared from usage and , rather than the traditional interdependence of melodic and chordal pitches sharing the same tonal basis , a clear distinction may exist between the pitch materials of the melody and harmony , commonly avoiding duplication . However , some traditional devices , such as repeated chords , are still used . 
 Jazz and other forms of modern popular music generally feature homophonic influences , following chord progressions over which musicians play a melody or improvise ( see melody @-@ dominated homophony ) . 
 = = = African and Asian music = = = 
 Homophony has appeared in several non @-@ Western cultures , perhaps particularly in regions where communal vocal music has been cultivated . When explorer Vasco da Gama landed in West Africa in 1497 , he referred to the music he heard there as being in " sweet harmony " . While the concept of harmony in that time was not necessarily the same as the concept of homophony as understood by modern scholars , it is generally accepted that homophonic voice harmonies were commonplace in African music for centuries before contact with Europeans and is common in African music today . Singers normally harmonize voices in homophonic parallelism moving in parallel thirds or fourths . This type of harmonic model is also , implemented in instrumental music where voices are stacked in thirds or fourths . <unk> Parallelism is not restricted to thirds and fourths , however all harmonic material adheres to the scalar system the particular tune or song is based on . The use of harmony in sixths is common in areas where a <unk> scale system is used . For instance , the Fang people of Gabon use homophony in their music . 
 In eastern Indonesia ( i.e. in the music of the Toraja in South Sulawesi , in Flores , in East Kalimantan and in North Sulawesi ) , two @-@ part harmonies are common , usually in intervals of thirds , fourths or fifths . Additionally , much music of the Middle East is generally homophonic , although polyphony is also an important texture , while Chinese music is generally thought to be homophonic , since instruments typically provide accompaniment in parallel fourths and fifths and often double the voice in vocal music , <unk> also being common in China . 
 = = Melody @-@ dominated homophony = = 
 In melody @-@ dominated homophony , accompanying voices provide chordal support for the lead voice , which assumes the melody . Some popular music today might be considered melody @-@ dominated homophony , voice typically taking on the lead role , while instruments like piano , guitar and bass guitar normally accompany the voice . In many cases , instruments also take on the lead role , and often the role switches between parts , voice taking the lead during a verse and instruments subsequently taking solos , during which the other instruments provide chordal support . 
 Monody is similar to melody @-@ dominated homophony in that one voice becomes the melody , while another voice assumes the underlying harmony . Monody , however , is characterized by a single voice with instrumental accompaniment , whereas melody @-@ dominated homophony refers to a broader category of homophonic music , which includes works for multiple voices , not just works for solo voice , as was the tradition with early 17th @-@ century Italian monody . 
 = St Iestyn 's Church , Llaniestyn = 
 St Iestyn 's Church , Llaniestyn is a medieval church in Llaniestyn , Anglesey , in Wales . A church is said to have been founded here by St Iestyn in the 7th century , with the earliest parts of the present building dating from the 12th century . The church was extended in the 14th century , with further changes over the coming years . It contains a 12th @-@ century font and a 14th @-@ century memorial stone to Iestyn , from the same workshop as the stone to St Pabo at St Pabo 's Church , Llanbabo . 
 The church is still in use , as part of the Church in Wales , and is one of seven churches in a combined parish . It is a Grade II * listed building , a national designation given to " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " , because of its age and retention of many original features , including the Iestyn effigy . 
 = = History and location = = 
 St Iestyn 's Church stands in a churchyard in a rural part of eastern Anglesey , near the village of Llanddona . The church gave its name to the area of Llaniestyn : the Welsh word llan originally meant " enclosure " and then " church " , with the saint 's name as a suffix . The date of foundation of the church is unknown . Geraint Jones , author of a 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey , notes that it is thought that St Iestyn , a nephew of the Anglesey saint St Cybi , established a religious community in this place in the 7th century . It was the last of the churches that he established . 
 According to the 19th @-@ century writer Samuel Lewis , the church was donated by Llywelyn the Great ( c . 1172 – 1240 ) to the priory he had established at Llanfaes . It is known that there was a church here before 1254 as it is recorded in the Norwich Valuation of that year . The oldest parts of the building , including the blocked west door , date back to the 12th century . There was an extension to the chancel , probably in the 14th century ; the east window is 15th @-@ century , and the south door dates from about 1500 . The 16th century saw the addition of the south transept . Restoration work took place in 1865 ( renewing the roof and adding the north window ) and in 1954 , when the west door was discovered . 
 St Iestyn 's is still in use for worship and belongs to the Church in Wales . It is one of seven churches within the combined benefice of Beaumaris with Llanddona and Llaniestyn . It is within the deanery of Tindaethwy and Menai , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . As of 2012 , the rector is the Reverend Neil <unk> . 
 = = Architecture and fittings = = 
 The church was built using rough rubble masonry with stone copings , with some parts covered in render . The chancel and nave together measure 38 feet 3 inches by 15 feet 6 inches ( 11 @.@ 66 by 4 @.@ 72 m ) ; the south transept is 18 by 15 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 by 4 @.@ 6 m ) . The internal walls have been whitewashed . The roof is made of slate . There is no change in the structure to denote the internal division between the nave , which is the oldest part of the building , and the chancel . There is a bellcote at the west end of the roof . The church entrance is through a porch on the south side ; it has been rebuilt , with some of the material dating from the 15th century . There is a round @-@ headed door inside a square door frame , with the date 1764 on the hinge . 
 The east window in the chancel is in the shape of a pointed arch and dates from the 15th century ; it has three lights topped with cinquefoils and a hood mould . On the north side of the nave there is a rectangular window from 1865 . The 16th @-@ century south transept has windows in the south and east walls : the south window has three lights topped with trefoils in a 16th @-@ century arch , and the east window is small and rectangular , using some dressings from the 14th century . The wide opening between the transept and the rest of the church is spanned with a large wooden beam . 
 The west wall of the south transept holds a late @-@ 14th @-@ century carved effigy stone of St Iestyn ; he wears a hooded cloak with a broach , holding a staff in his right hand and an inscribed scroll in his left . He is bearded and has the appearance of a hermit , or of a Franciscan monk ( Samuel Lewis commenting that the cord and tassel hanging from the girdle around his waist were similar to those worn by monks in that order ) . There are flowers in the background . The historian Peter Lord has written that the depiction of the staff and broach is so accurate that it suggests that " these artefacts , which were already objects of veneration , survived for the sculptor to copy " . The inscription reads H [ I ] C : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> : CVI : / <unk> [ <unk> ] N [ F : <unk> ] C : ET : <unk> : AP : <unk> : O [ BT ] <unk> : IN OB / <unk> : <unk> : <unk> / NE : P : <unk> : <unk> : S ( " Here lies Iestyn to whom Gwenllian ferch Madog and Gruffydd ap Gwilym offered this image for the health of their souls " ) . It is made of grey sandstone , from Flintshire in north @-@ east Wales – an area where the donor of the effigy , Gruffudd ap Gwilym , had land . He also had land at Llaniestyn , and it is probable that he paid for rebuilding work at the church . The woman appearing in the inscription was Gruffudd 's aunt . The stone originates from the same workshop as similar memorials in the area : there is one at Bangor Cathedral , and one to St Pabo at St Pabo 's Church , Llanbabo ( also on Anglesey ) . The stone may originally have been used as part of a shrine for the saint . It was positioned in front of the altar in the 18th century , but was thereafter moved to its present location . 
 The cylindrical font , at the west end of the nave , is from the 12th century . The outside of the font is decorated with carvings in three bands . The bottom band contains round @-@ headed arches , the middle band has a series of chevrons , and the top band has various crosses , <unk> patterns and other decorations . It has similarities of design and style with the font at St Peulan 's Church , Llanbeulan . There is an 18th @-@ century stone tablet recording benefactions to the poor of the parish on the north wall of the chancel . The communion table and rails date from the late 17th century . 
 The churchyard contains the war grave of an airman of World War II . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II * listed building – the second @-@ highest of the three grades of listing , designating " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " . It was given this status on 30 January 1968 , and has been listed because it is a " good Medieval rural church which retains many original and early features " . Cadw ( the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) particularly notes the " fine 14th @-@ century effigy memorial " of St Iestyn . 
 Writing in 1847 , the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that the church was one of the " plainest " in Anglesey , but had " two treasures " . He described the font as " remarkably curious " , and said that there were " few monumental effigies in Wales of a higher antiquarian value " than the image of St Iestyn . A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region notes the " barn @-@ like " entrance of the porch , and describes the effigy of St Iestyn as " surprisingly accomplished " .

 Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein had left KG 51 by January 1942 , after he had volunteered for the night fighter force and been appointed Staffelkapitän ( squadron leader ) of the 9 . / Nachtjagdgeschwader 2 ( 9 . / NJG 2 — 9th Squadron of the 2nd Night Fighter Wing ) on 1 November 1941 . He claimed his first nocturnal victory — a Bristol Blenheim 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) west of Walcheren — on the night of 6 May 1942 , while serving with the <unk> ( Supplementary Group ) of NJG 2 . He shot down three aircraft in both the nights of 31 July 1942 ( victories 15 – 17 ) and 10 September 1942 ( victories 19 – 21 ) . Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein received the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) on 7 October 1942 , after 22 aerial victories . The award was presented by General Josef Kammhuber , after which they both inspected the personnel of 9 . / NJG 2 . 
 Hauptmann ( captain ) Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein was moved to the Eastern Front in February 1943 after he had been appointed Gruppenkommandeur ( group commander ) of the IV . / Nachtjagdgeschwader 5 ( IV . / NJG 5 — 4th Squadron of the 5th Night Fighter Wing ) on 1 December 1942 .

Kümmeritz and Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein took off in their usual Ju 88 C and shot down four Avro Lancaster bombers ( victories 32 – 35 ) . Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein never flew another Bf 110 again , preferring his Ju 88 to the Bf 110 . The group was relocated to the Eastern Front again and redesignated as I. / Nachtjagdgeschwader 100 ( I. / NJG 100 — 1st Squadron of the 100th Night Fighter Wing ) on 1 August 1943 . While stationed at Insterburg , East Prussia , Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein shot down seven aircraft in one mission , six of them within 47 minutes ( victories 36 – 41 ) , in the area north @-@ east of Oryol on 20 July 1943 . 
 Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein claimed three more victories on 1 August 1943 ( victories 44 – 46 ) and three more on the night of 3 August 1943 ( victories 48 – 50 ) .

Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein became the 290th recipient of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub ) after 54 aerial victories on 31 August 1943 . The award was presented at the Führerhauptquartier in East Prussia on 22 September 1943 . For these achievements he also received a letter from the commanding general of the 4 . Jagd @-@ Division ( 4th Fighter Division ) Generalleutnant ( lieutenant general ) Joachim @-@ Friedrich Huth . 
 On 1 December 1943 , Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein was ordered to take over command of the II . / Nachtjagdgeschwader 2 ( II . / NJG 2 — 2nd Groupe of the 2nd Night Fighter Wing ) . He was appointed Geschwaderkommodore ( wing commander ) of NJG 2 on 1 January 1944 ; he had already reached 68 aerial victories . He claimed shooting down six four @-@ engined bombers on the same night ( victories 69 – 74 ) . In late 1943 , his wireless operator Kümmeritz went on study leave and was replaced by Feldwebel ( warrant officer ) Friedrich Ostheimer , who flew with Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein from October 1943 until January 1944 . 
 On the night of 20 January 1944 Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein claimed three enemy aircraft shot down in the Berlin area ( victories 76 – 78 ) . He almost collided with the third burning Lancaster which went into a dive and came very close to his own Ju 88 . The Ju 88 went out of control and Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein regained control of his just @-@ flyable aircraft . His radio operator on this mission , Feldwebel Friedrich Ostheimer established contact with the airfield at Erfurt . Since the aircraft began stalling after the wheels and flaps went down the crew decided to belly @-@ land the aircraft . They discovered that about 2 meters ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) of the wing had been cut off by the Lancaster 's propeller . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 The next day , 21 January 1944 , Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein , wireless operator Ostheimer and board mechanic Unteroffizier Kurt <unk> took off on a Zahme Sau ( Tame Boar ) , a combination of ground controlled and airborne radar , night fighter intercept mission flying the Ju 88 R4 + XM ( Werknummer 750 467 — factory number ) , which normally was assigned to the Technical Officer of NJG 2 . At 22 : 00 contact with the first of five Lancasters was established and shot down which was observed to explode at 22 : 05 . Between 22 : 10 and 22 : 15 the second Lancaster was shot down . Observers reported the third Lancaster exploded at approximately 22 : 30 , followed shortly by number four , which hit the ground at 22 : 40 . During the fifth and final attack , the four @-@ engined bomber was burning when their Ju 88 came under attack , presumably from British fighter escorts . In the attack , their left wing caught fire . Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein ordered his crew to jump , and Ostheimer and <unk> parachuted to safety from the damaged aircraft . 
 The next day , Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein 's body was found near the wreckage of the Ju 88 in a forest area belonging to the municipality of <unk> by <unk> . His parachute was discovered unopened and it was deduced that he may have hit his head on the vertical stabiliser of his aircraft when trying to escape . The death certificate listed " closed fracture of the skull and facial bone " as his cause of death . He was posthumously awarded the 44th Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern ) on 23 January 1944 . Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein had flown 320 combat missions , 150 of which as a bomber pilot or observer . At the time of his death he was the leading night fighter pilot with 83 aerial victories , with 23 of them claimed on the Eastern and 60 on the Western Front . 
 On 25 January 1944 , Heinrich zu Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein 's death was announced in the Wehrmachtbericht , an information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht . He was buried on 29 January 1944 in the Geschwader cemetery at the Deelen Air Base . His remains were re @-@ interred in 1948 . He is now resting next to Prinz Egmont zur Lippe @-@ Weißenfeld at the Ysselsteyn German war cemetery in the Netherlands . 
 The question who shot down Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein is unanswered . Friedrich Ostheimer remained convinced that they were shot down by a long range intruder de Havilland Mosquito night fighter . However , no Mosquito pilot claimed an aerial victory that night . A closer analysis reveals that three Mosquitos , two Serrate @-@ equipped aircraft from No. 141 Squadron RAF and one from No. 239 Squadron RAF , participated in the attacks on Magdeburg . Only one Mosquito had enemy contact : No. 141 's squadron Mosquito <unk> , <unk> , piloted by Pilot Officer Desmon Snape with Flying Officer L. Fowler as his radar operator reported radar contact at 23 : 15 south of Brandenburg . After three to four minutes of pursuit they encountered a Ju 88 with its position lights on . They attacked the Ju 88 and believed to have damaged it behind its cockpit , but they did not claim a victory . This encounter exactly matches the time and area in which Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein was killed . 
 = = Personality = = 
 Night fighter pilot Wilhelm <unk> commented on the arrival of Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein at his unit : " ... A madman , I thought , as I took my leave . Once outside I got into conversation with the Prince 's crew . Among other things they told me that their princely coachman had recently made his radio operator stand to attention in the plane and confined him to his quarters for three days because he ( the radio operator ) had lost his screen [ radar contact with the enemy ] during a mission . " 
 Herbert Kümmeritz recalled that Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein often used his seniority and rank to ensure that he would get the best initial contact with the incoming bombers . He would often wait on the ground until the best contact was established . If another fighter had already engaged the enemy before <unk> arrived , the prince would announce on the radio " Hier Wittgenstein — geh <unk> ! " ( Wittgenstein here , clear off ! ) 
 Wolfgang Falck felt that Sayn @-@ Wittgenstein was not officer @-@ material . Falck described him as : " ... not the type to be a leader of a unit . He was not a teacher , educator or instructor . But he was an outstanding personality , magnificent fighter and great operational pilot . He had an astonishing sixth sense — an intuition that permitted him to see and even feel where other aircraft were . It was like a personal radar system . He was an excellent air @-@ to @-@ air shot . " 
 His mother , Princess Walburga , commented that : " ... he was boundlessly disillusioned and boundlessly disappointed . In 1943 he contemplated the thought of shooting Hitler . It was only out of sense of honor and duty that Heinrich went on fighting , carried along by the ambition to overtake Major Lent in his score of enemy aircraft shot down " . In her memoirs , Tatiana von Metternich reported that Wittgenstein planned to kill Hitler after the ceremony at which he received his Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross in 1943 . He said , " I am not married , I have no children — I am expendable . He will receive me personally . Who else among us can ever get as near to him ? "

 The Brabham BT46 is a Formula One racing car designed by Gordon Murray for the Brabham team , owned by Bernie Ecclestone , for the 1978 Formula One season . The car featured several radical design elements , the most obvious of which was the use of flat panel heat exchangers on the bodywork of the car to replace conventional water and oil radiators . The concept did not work in practice and was removed before the car ’ s race debut , never to be seen again . The cars , powered by a flat @-@ 12 Alfa Romeo engine , raced competitively with modified nose @-@ mounted radiators for most of the year , driven by Niki Lauda and John Watson , winning one race in this form and scoring sufficient points for the team to finish third in the constructors championship . 
 The " B " variant of the car , also known as the " fan car " , was introduced at the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix as a counter to the dominant ground effect Lotus 79 . The BT46B generated an immense level of downforce by means of a fan , claimed to be for increased cooling , but which also extracted air from beneath the car . The car only raced once in this configuration in the Formula One World Championship — when Niki Lauda won the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix at <unk> . The concept was withdrawn by Brabham after one race even though the FIA had ruled it could be used for the remainder of that season . 
 = = Concept = = 
 The first Alfa @-@ Romeo engined Brabham , the Brabham <unk> was an overweight and bulky car , initially weighing 625 kg and as wide as was permitted under the F1 technical regulations . This was due to the difficulties of packaging the large , powerful Alfa flat @-@ 12 engine and the fuel it required to complete a race distance . After lengthy development , it became competitive , but never won a race . In mid 1977 , Brabham designer Gordon Murray started work on the ambitious design of the BT46 . It was intended to compensate for the weight of the engine and fuel and allow the Brabham team to take a large technical step forward as well as to improve safety . 
 = = Engine and transmission = = 
 Alfa @-@ Romeo ’ s sportscar @-@ derived flat @-@ 12 engine had a capacity of 2995 cc and employed fuel injection and electronic ignition . The engine featured a cast magnesium alloy engine block with aluminium alloy crankcase and magnesium or aluminium cylinder heads . There were four gear driven valves per cylinder . In Formula One form by 1978 it delivered about 520 bhp at 12 @,@ 000 rpm , about 50 bhp more than the Cosworth DFV engines used by most teams , as well as a peak 324 lb / ft of torque ( 439 N · m ) . However the power came at the expense of greater size , increased fuel and oil consumption and about 40 kg more weight . The engine was also difficult to work with , with significant variations in dimensions between units . 
 The car used a revised and lighter version of the 6 @-@ speed gearbox designed for the <unk> . Brabham designed the gearbox casing , which was cast by Alfa Romeo and used Hewland gears . 
 = = Chassis and suspension = = 
 The BT46 was an aluminium alloy monocoque featuring the trapezoidal cross section common to many of Gordon Murray ’ s 1970s designs . It featured inbuilt pneumatic jacks fed from an external supply of compressed air to lift it off the ground for tyre changes during practice . It employed a very early version of the carbon brakes that were in universal use by the mid @-@ 1980s — a concept taken from the aircraft industry . The system , which Brabham had been developing since 1976 , combined carbon composite brake pads with a steel disc faced with carbon composite ' pucks ' . 
 The most radical feature of the original car was its use of flat plate heat exchangers mounted flush to the surface of the bodywork in place of conventional water radiators . The absence of standard radiators allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the large engine and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section ( important to reduce drag ) . In practice the heat exchangers did not provide anything like enough cooling capacity , one of South African Murray ’ s rare design failures , and were replaced by more standard radiators in the nose of the car , similar to that of the <unk> , compromising its aerodynamic efficiency . In addition to the question of drag the nose @-@ mounted radiators moved weight towards the front of the car . 
 = = Racing history = = 
 The BT46 debuted at the third race of the 1978 season , the South African Grand Prix on 4 March 1978 , with the revised nose mounted radiators . The cars were immediately competitive , although reliability was suspect . 
 After the winning debut and subsequent withdrawal of the BT46B “ fan car ” at the Swedish Grand Prix ( see below ) the Brabham team completed the season with the standard <unk> . Niki Lauda winning the Italian Grand Prix in the standard car , albeit after Mario Andretti and Gilles Villeneuve were penalised a minute for jumping the second race start after Ronnie Peterson ’ s fatal accident at the first start . 
 The BT46 appeared for the last time in the Formula One World Championship at the first round of the 1979 season in the hands of Nelson Piquet . Niki Lauda also used the car to qualify for that race , as the new BT48 was proving troublesome , although he did race the new car . Piquet retired on the first lap after a multi @-@ car collision that wrecked the BT46 .

 = = = Concept = = = 
 Lotus had introduced the concept of ground effect to the Formula One world championship in 1977 with their fast , but not always reliable , Type 78 . Peter Wright and Colin Chapman had discovered that by carefully shaping the underside of the car , they could accelerate the air passing under the car , thereby reducing the air pressure under the car relative to that over it and pushing the tyres down harder onto the track . The increased downforce gave more grip and thus higher cornering speeds . Ground effect had the great advantage of being a low drag solution , unlike conventional wings , meaning that the increased cornering ability was not compromised by a decrease in straight line speed . In 1978 Lotus ironed out the reliability problems and further developed the concept from relatively simple sidepods with a wing profile into full venturi tunnels under the car . As soon as they appeared at Zolder , the black and gold Type <unk> of Mario Andretti and Ronnie Peterson outpaced the opposition by a comfortable margin . 
 It had not been clear to other designers just what Wright and Chapman had done with the Type 78 , but by early 1978 , Gordon Murray had grasped how the Lotus design was achieving its remarkable levels of grip . He also realised that the Alfa Romeo flat @-@ 12 engine used by Brabham that season was too wide to permit the Venturi tunnels needed for really significant ground effect . At Murray 's instigation , Alfa went on to produce a V12 engine for the 1979 season . Ferrari , however , persisted with the flat @-@ 12 design and therefore lacked full ground effect until their disastrous 1980 season . In the meantime , Murray 's idea was to use another way of reducing the pressure underneath the car . In 1970 the Chaparral 2J " sucker car " had proved significantly faster than its opposition in the North American Can @-@ Am sportscar series . The 2J had two fans at the rear of the car driven by a dedicated two @-@ stroke engine to draw large amounts of air from under the chassis , reducing pressure and creating downforce . It had suffered from reliability problems with the second engine before being banned by the sporting authorities . 
 Murray designed a version driven by a complex series of clutches running from the engine to a large single fan at the back of the car . Therefore , the faster the engine ran , the stronger the suction effect . Like the Lotus , it had sliding " skirts " that sealed the gap between the sides of the cars and the ground . These prevented excessive air from being sucked into the low pressure area under the car and dissipating the ground effect . There was a rule banning " moveable aerodynamic devices " , but the fan also drew air through a horizontally mounted radiator over the engine . Using a fan to assist cooling was legal — Brabham had used a small electric fan to this effect on the <unk> at the South American races at the start of the year — and Brabham claimed that this was the primary effect of the new device . These claims were lent some legitimacy by the cooling system design issues that had affected the original design at the start of the year . 
 The cars were modified <unk> — chassis numbers BT46 / 4 and BT46 / 6 . Modifications to implement the fan concept were quite extensive — involving sealing the engine bay as well as adding the clutch system and the fan . They were designed and tested in some secrecy . Brabham 's lead driver , Niki Lauda , realised he had to adjust his driving style , mostly for cornering . He found that if he accelerated around corners , the car would " stick " to the road as if it were on rails . This had the side effect of exposing the driver to very high lateral acceleration , which would become a major problem in the ground effect era . In his autobiography , Lauda described the car as being unpleasant to drive due to the lateral loads and reliance on aerodynamics over driver skill . He realised early on that the rate of ground effect development meant that in the future , every driver would be exposed to such g @-@ loading while behind the wheel of such a car , and the physical effort needed to drive the cars would leave the drivers exhausted by the end of the races . 
 = = = Racing history and aftermath = = = 
 The two modified cars were prepared for the Swedish Grand Prix at <unk> on 17 June 1978 , for Niki Lauda and John Watson . When not in use , the fan was covered by a dustbin lid , but it soon became clear what the modified Brabham was intended to achieve : when the drivers <unk> the throttle , the car could be seen to squat down on its suspension as the downforce increased . Lotus driver Mario Andretti said " It is like a bloody great vacuum cleaner . It throws muck and rubbish at you at a hell of a rate " . Murray says that this was untrue : " The fan couldn 't spit anything out the back because the fan e @-@ flux [ exit speed ] was only 55 mph . Besides the radial fan would have sent any stones flying sideways " . The legality of the cars was soon protested , but they were allowed to race . They qualified second and third behind championship leader Andretti . In the race , Watson spun off on the 19th lap . Once a back @-@ marker dropped oil onto the track and with both major front @-@ runners out the race , the remaining Brabham was in a class of its own , seemingly unaffected by the slippery surface . Lauda passed Andretti around the outside of one of the corners , who dropped out shortly afterwards due to a broken valve , and went on to win by over half a minute from Riccardo Patrese in an Arrows . 
 There was uproar from rival teams , who saw the " fan car " as a threat to their competitiveness . Lotus immediately started design work on a fan version of the 79 . Bernie Ecclestone , owner of the Brabham team , had also been secretary of the Formula One Constructors Association ( FOCA ) since 1972 and became its president during 1978 . According to Ecclestone 's biographer Terry Lovell , the heads of the other FOCA teams , led by Colin Chapman threatened to withdraw their support for Ecclestone unless he withdrew the BT46B . Ecclestone negotiated a deal within FOCA whereby the car would have continued for another three races before Brabham would voluntarily withdraw it . However , the Commission <unk> Internationale intervened to declare that henceforth fan cars would not be allowed and the car never raced again in Formula One . The car was not considered to have been illegal when it raced however , so the Swedish Grand Prix win stood . The two converted chassis were returned to standard BT46 configuration for the next race . 
 A BT46 competed in ' B ' specification once again in 1979 in the Gunnar Nilsson Trophy race at Donington Park . This was an event held to raise funds for the Gunnar Nilsson Cancer Fund . Originally intended as a non @-@ championship Formula One race , without FIA sanction it was instead run in a time trial format , with victory going to the fastest single lap recorded . As it was not an FIA event , the car 's illegality was not a factor . Nelson Piquet drove , coming fourth of the five cars competing .

 Murray had designed a car for the 1979 season called the <unk> that had a Chaparral 2J @-@ type box rear end with twin variable geometry fans on the rear to maximize ground effect . The car was never built thanks to the FIA closing the loophole in the regulations for the 1979 season .

 Another variation on the theme was produced later in the season . Like the BT46B , the BT46C removed the radiators from the front wing assembly leaving a clean aerodynamic wing and moving the centre of gravity further back again .

 = Australian swellshark = 
 Not to be confused with the draughtsboard shark , Cephaloscyllium isabellum , of New Zealand . 
 The Australian swellshark or <unk> shark ( Cephaloscyllium laticeps ) is a species of catshark , and part of the family Scyliorhinidae , endemic to southern Australia . This bottom @-@ dwelling species can be found on the continental shelf down to a depth of 220 m ( 720 ft ) . Usually measuring 1 m ( 3 ft ) long , it is a stout @-@ bodied , broad @-@ headed shark with a short tail and a first dorsal fin much larger than the second . It can be identified by its variegated dorsal coloration of brown or gray patches and numerous spots . 
 Australian swellsharks are sedentary and mainly nocturnal , with most individuals remaining within the same local area throughout the year . It feeds on small crustaceans , cephalopods , and fishes . When threatened , it responds by rapidly taking in water or air to inflate its body , hence the name " swellshark " . This shark is oviparous and females lay pairs of distinctively ridged egg capsules at 20 – 30 day intervals . The eggs hatch after 11 – 12 months . Harmless and of little commercial interest , many Australian swellsharks are caught incidentally in gillnets and bottom trawls but usually survive to be released because of their extreme hardiness . As a result , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed this species as of Least Concern . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The first scientific description of the Australian swellshark , as Scyllium laticeps , was published in 1853 by French zoologist Auguste Duméril , in the scientific journal Revue et Magasin de Zoologie . The type specimen was a 79 cm ( 31 in ) long male caught off Tasmania . The specific epithet laticeps is derived from the Latin latus , meaning " broad " , with the suffix ceps , meaning " head " . Other common names for this species include <unk> ( a reference to its ability to inflate ) , Isabell 's swell shark , nutcracker shark , rock shark , sleepy Joe , and spotted swellshark . This species is almost identical to the draughtsboard shark ( C. isabellum ) of New Zealand ; the two species differ in coloration and the form of their egg cases ( ridged in C. laticeps versus smooth in C. isabellum ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Australian swellshark has a stocky , rounded body that tapers significantly to the short caudal peduncle . The head comprises no more than a fifth of the total length and is broad and moderately flattened , with a very short , thick , blunt snout . The nostrils are divided into small incurrent and excurrent openings by short , triangular flaps of skin that do not reach the mouth . The mouth is extremely large , without furrows at the corners . The teeth are numerous and small with multiple cusps ; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed . The large , oval eyes are placed somewhat on the upper surface of the head , and have rudimentary nictitating membranes ( protective third eyelids ) and ridges underneath . 
 There are two dorsal fins , the first much larger than the second . The first dorsal originates over the forward half of the pelvic fin bases , while the second is located over the anal fin . The pectoral fins are large and broad , and the anal fin is larger than the second dorsal fin . The short and broad caudal fin has an indistinct lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe . The skin is thick and covered by well @-@ calcified , arrowhead @-@ shaped dermal denticles , which are more sparse in young sharks . The back and sides are light gray to brown , with an irregular pattern of close @-@ set darker saddles and blotches along with many dark ( sometimes light ) spots , and a dark stripe from under the eye to the pectoral fin origins . The fins do not have sharply lighter margins . The underside is cream @-@ colored , with some mottling on the fins and often a dark stripe running down the middle in adults . The maximum known length is 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) , though few exceed 1 @.@ 0 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Australian swellshark inhabits the continental shelf of southern Australia , from the Recherche Archipelago off Western Australia to Jervis Bay in New South Wales , including Tasmania . It is commonly found on or near the bottom amongst rocky reefs or seaweed beds , from close to shore to a depth of 220 m ( 720 ft ) . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The most abundant catshark species in the coastal waters of southern Australia , the Australian swellshark is a generally sluggish swimmer that is more active at night . During the day , it is often found resting singly or in groups under ledges or inside caves . Tracking studies have shown that some individuals are continuously active for months at a time , while others alternate activity with periods of stationary rest lasting up to five days . Most Australian swellsharks present within a given region tend to remain there year @-@ round , frequenting established feeding areas or preferred habitats . On the other hand , a minority of sharks have been recorded covering distances of up to 300 km ( 190 mi ) . This extremely hardy species can survive for more than a day out of water . 
 One of the higher @-@ level predators within its ecosystem , the Australian swellshark feeds on crustaceans ( particularly crabs and rock lobsters ) , cephalopods ( including squid and octopus ) , and small fishes . Even large @-@ sized prey tends to be swallowed whole ; the long periods of rest exhibited by some sharks may relate to digestion . Like the other members of its genus , this shark is capable of rapidly inflating its body by taking water or air into its stomach , as a defense against predators . These include larger fishes , such as the broadnose sevengill shark ( Notorynchus cepedianus ) , and marine mammals . By inflating , the shark may be able to wedge itself inside crevices , make itself harder to swallow , or simply intimidate a would @-@ be predator . Marine snails are known to prey upon this shark 's eggs . The Australian swellshark serves as a host to a number of parasite species , but these are poorly documented .

 The Australian swellshark is oviparous . Males have larger teeth than females , with which to bite and hold onto them for copulation . Whether there is a specific mating season is uncertain , though in terms of sperm production males are capable of breeding year @-@ round . Females have a single functional ovary and two oviducts , ovulating a single egg into each at a time . They can store sperm for at least 15 months . Females produce eggs throughout the year , laying them in pairs approximately once every 20 days from January to June , and once every 30 days the rest of the year . The second egg in a pair is deposited 12 – 24 hours after the first . 
 The pale , flask @-@ shaped egg capsules measure 13 cm ( 5 in ) long and 5 cm ( 2 in ) across , and bear 19 – 27 crosswise ridges . There are long , curling tendrils at the four corners , which allow the female to attach the capsule to seaweed or other bottom structures . In captivity , the embryo develops external gills at two months old , which are retained until it is five months old , at which time the internal gills take over and the first pigmentation appears . At six months , embryonic growth accelerates and the yolk sac begins to shrink , disappearing by nine to ten months of age . Hatching usually occurs at eleven to twelve months ; the newly emerged young are miniature versions of the adults measuring 14 cm ( 6 in ) long . Males mature sexually at a length of 71 – 87 cm ( 28 – 34 in ) , and females at 75 – 86 cm ( 30 – 34 in ) .

 The Australian swellshark is harmless to humans and seldom utilized , though recently in parts of Tasmania some have begun to be marketed as a source of " flake " . It is regarded as a nuisance by lobster fishers due to its habit of entering traps to eat the contents . Every year , substantial numbers of Australian swellsharks are caught as bycatch in the southeast Australian shark gillnet fishery , and more in bottom trawls and on longlines . These animals are usually released , and likely suffer minimal mortality due to their resilience . Since this species at present faces little risk from fisheries , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed it under Least Concern . Although commercial fisheries reported drops in Australian swellshark catches from 1973 to 1976 and 1998 to 2001 , these appeared to have resulted from changing fishing habits rather than actual population declines . Nevertheless , as a precaution the government of Tasmania has instituted a possession limit of two sharks per person or five sharks per boat per day .

 The first season of True Detective , an American anthology crime drama television series created by Nic Pizzolatto , premiered on January 12 , 2014 on the premium cable network HBO . Its principal cast consisted of Matthew McConaughey , Woody Harrelson , Michelle Monaghan , Michael Potts , and Tory Kittles . The season had eight episodes ; its initial airing concluded on March 9 , 2014 . 
 Engineered as a flashback narrative , the season focuses on the lives of Louisiana State Police homicide detectives Rustin " Rust " Cohle ( McConaughey ) and Martin " Marty " Hart ( Harrelson ) . Over a seventeen @-@ year period , they must recount the investigation into the murder of prostitute Dora Lange and the histories of several other unsolved crimes , the perpetrator of which remains at large . During this time , Hart 's personal problems threaten his marriage to Maggie ( Monaghan ) , and Cohle struggles to cope with his troubled past . The season explores masculinity and Christianity , and the show 's portrayal of women and the influences of horror and comic literature on its main narrative have been the subject of analysis . 
 Pizzolatto initially conceived True Detective as a novel , but felt it was more suitable for television . The episodes , directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga , were filmed in Louisiana over a three @-@ month period . The series received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and was cited as one of the strongest dramas of the 2014 television season . It was a candidate for numerous television awards , including a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film , and won several other honors recognizing its writing , cinematography , direction , and acting .

 Before creating True Detective , Nic Pizzolatto had worked as a literature professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , DePauw University , and the University of Chicago . He developed a fascination for fiction writing while attending graduate school at the University of Arkansas ; inspired by HBO 's series The Wire , The Sopranos , and Deadwood , he began working on a short story collection that he later published as Between Here and the Yellow Sea in 2006 . Several years later , he wrote a full @-@ length novel titled Galveston ( 2010 ) , and around the same time he began preparing to write for television ; his earlier attempts were unsuccessful because of a lack of money . 
 Pizzolatto was appointed as a screenwriter for AMC 's series The Killing in 2011 . He credits the show with giving him a glimpse of the inner workings of the television industry . Pizzolatto grew increasingly dissatisfied with the series ' creative direction , and left the writing staff two weeks into its second season . 
 True Detective was originally intended to be the follow @-@ up to Galveston , but once the project took definite form , Pizzolatto thought it was more suitable on screen . The writer pitched Galveston to two executives , and from May to July 2010 he developed six screenplays , including an early , 90 @-@ page draft of the pilot episode script . He wrote another script for the series shortly after his departure from The Killing , thanks in part to the support of the production company Anonymous Content . Pizzolatto did not hire a writing staff at this point because he believed such an approach would not yield the desired result . The final copy of the project script was 500 pages long . Pizzolatto secured a development deal with HBO for a potential pilot series early on , and by April 2012 , the network had commissioned eight episodes of True Detective . 
 = = = Casting and crew = = = 
 Pizzolatto began contemplating the lead roles while he was pitching the series to networks in early 2012 . True Detective 's anthology format allowed him the freedom to employ film stars " because they 'd only be committed to one season " . Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey were among the actors Pizzolatto considered for star billing . McConaughey , who had recently finished filming Killer Joe ( 2011 ) , was contracted well before HBO commissioned the season . Impressed with his performance in The Lincoln Lawyer ( 2011 ) , Pizzolatto at first assigned him to play Hart but McConaughey convinced him to give him the part of Cohle . When asked in a Variety interview about his decision to switch parts , the actor replied , " I wanted to get in that dude 's head . The obsession , the island of a man — I 'm always looking for a guy who monologues . It 's something really important as I feel I 'm going into my better work . " To prepare for the role , McConaughey created a 450 @-@ page analysis — the " Four Stages of Rustin Cohle " — to study his character 's evolution during the season . 
 Harrelson was the season 's next significant casting , brought on to play Hart at McConaughey 's request . Harrelson , who joined True Detective in part because of the people involved in the project , had previously worked with HBO in the 2012 film Game Change . Michelle Monaghan agreed to play the season 's female lead , Maggie , once she realized her character arc and " really saw where these characters went " . Michael Potts and Tory Kittles completed the principal cast , playing detectives Maynard Gilbough and Thomas Papania , respectively . Major supporting roles in True Detective 's first season include Kevin Dunn as Major Ken Quesada , Alexandra Daddario as Lisa <unk> , and Brad Carter as Charlie Lange . 
 Pizzolatto narrowed his search for a suitable director down to Alejandro González Iñárritu and Cary Joji Fukunaga , the latter of whom he knew from Anonymous Content . Fukunaga was formally appointed as director after Iñárritu pulled out of the project because of film commitments . In preparation for his services , he carried out research with a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police 's Criminal Investigations Division to develop an accurate depiction of a 1990s homicide detective 's work . Fukunaga recruited Adam Arkapaw , director of photography of Top of the Lake , as project cinematographer . Arkapaw came to the director 's attention for his work in Animal Kingdom ( 2010 ) and Snowtown ( 2011 ) , and was hired after the two men negotiated a deal at a meeting in San Francisco . Alex DiGerlando , who Fukunaga had worked with on <unk> <unk> 's Glory at Sea in 2008 , was appointed as the production designer . Fukunaga said in an interview , " I knew what Alex accomplished in the swamps of Louisiana and given some money , how much more amazing he could be in building sets that would just be used for one or two days and be abandoned again " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Initially , True Detective 's first season was due to shoot in Arkansas , but Pizzolatto later chose to film in Louisiana to take advantage of state tax incentives and the area 's distinctive landscape : " There 's a contradictory nature to the place and a sort of sinister quality underneath it all ... [ e ] verything lives under layers of concealment . The woods are thick and dark and impenetrable . On the other hand you have the beauty of it all from a distance . " Principal photography consumed three months ( between 100 and 110 days ) , from January to June 2013 . Approximately five minutes of film was shot per day . The crew constructed various set pieces , among them being a scorched chapel , Joel Theriot 's tent revival , and the Louisiana State Criminal Investigations Division offices , the last of which they built inside an abandoned lightbulb warehouse near Elmwood . For the Dora Lange crime scene , production filmed exterior shots at a remote sugarcane field outside Erath which , because it was partially burned , inspired a " moody and atmospheric " backdrop for corresponding scenes . Other filming locations include the old Kenner High School campus and Fort Macomb , a nineteenth @-@ century fort outside New Orleans . 
 Fukunaga took cues from David Lynch 's Twin Peaks to adapt his filming style for TV . The entire season was shot on 35 mm film , which the crew chose to achieve " a slightly nostalgic " quality . Scenes were filmed using a Panavision Millennium <unk> camera , but the choice of lensing depended on the period from which said scenes took place . Those that were set in 1995 and 2002 were captured with Panavision <unk> lenses . They produced a soft quality in its imaging because they were made of recycled low contrast glass . As these scenes were written as a reflection of Cohle and Hart 's memory , production sought to make them as cinematic as possible , to reflect " the fragmentation of their lucid imaginations back through their past " . To achieve this , they relied on 40 mm lenses to exaggerate composition . The 2012 scenes were shot with Panavision Primo lenses : the visual palette in comparison was sharper and had much more contrast , creating a modern aesthetic and helping " pull characters out from their environments to hopefully help audiences get inside their heads " . 
 = = = Art design = = = 
 Joshua Walsh was responsible for creating True Detective 's artwork . His work for the show consists of over 100 individual " devil 's nests " — twig sculptures — in addition to wall paintings and miniature , Munch @-@ like men made of beer cans , among others . According to DiGerlando , Walsh 's interests in hunting and taxidermy made him " the perfect dude for the job " . A blueprint for the twig sculptures was not well established in the script , so the duo went with a tripod structure , which when put on its side , would naturally spiral at the base . Many had cross @-@ members linking each side , sometimes resembling a ladder , though each design had subtle differences from one another . Henry <unk> and James Charles Castle were cited as strong stylistic influences on Walsh 's early work . DiGerlando wanted the sculptures to look primitive , to reveal the workings of a man with " some deep inner urge to express himself , and he does it through these murders and these constructions . " As such , Walsh built devil 's nests using mud , disposable children 's clothing , reeds , roots , and other materials he felt the antagonist would use himself . 
 The creation of the season 's title sequence was a collaboration between director Patrick Clair and his Santa Monica @-@ based studio Elastic , Clair 's Sydney @-@ based studio Antibody , and Brisbane @-@ based company Breeder . Pizzolatto and Fukunaga wanted the team to emphasize southern Louisiana 's remote landscape , which juxtaposes many of the characters ' traits and personal , inner struggles . Clair stated that from the start he had an " unusually clear " vision of True Detective 's finished opening sequence . Using Richard <unk> 's Petrochemical America ( 2012 ) as a template , the production team initially photographed the local scenery , which were woven together to form the core of the title sequence . By the time production began animating , they had faced several problems : photographic stills were too grainy and footage was too jagged . As a result , many shots were digitally altered and slowed to about a tenth of their original speed , which , according to Clair , " evoked a surreal and floaty mood that perfectly captured what we were after " . 
 Creation of a 3D effect required the design team to use an assortment of low poly meshes . Using a variety of animation and special effects techniques , these images were later superimposed " with painstaking care " to avoid a sterile , digitized look . Clair said , " The most crucial thing to me was that this didn 't feel digital , so we went to great lengths to incorporate as much organic imagery as possible " . For some stills , the design team created digital doubles to develop more texture . The sequence 's final cut was polished using optical glitching and motion distortion techniques . Season one 's opening theme is " Far From Any Road " , an alternative country song originally composed by The Handsome Family for their 2003 album Singing Bones . The Sydney Morning Herald included the opening sequence in its list of the " Ten of the Best " title sequences on television . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The True Detective soundtrack features a compilation of gospel and blues music , which were selected by Pizzolatto and T Bone Burnett . The pair opposed the use of Cajun music and swamp blues for the season 's musical score because " it 's already been done so much " . Burnett said the score was intended to be character @-@ driven , rather than inspired by other crime fiction drama . Songs by Bo Diddley , The Staple Singers , <unk> , Vashti Bunyan , Townes Van Zandt , and Captain Beefheart appear in season one . Burnett also composed original pieces with Cassandra Wilson and Rhiannon Giddens , the latter of whom used a <unk> synthesizer . HBO released an abridged soundtrack album , featuring 14 tracks from True Detective 's first two seasons , on August 14 , 2015 through physical media and iTunes . 
 = = Themes and influences = = 
 Commentators noted the appearance of masculinity within True Detective , especially as it pertains to its portrayal of women . Christopher <unk> of Southern Spaces said the show was about " men living in a brutally masculine world " and as such , women are depicted as " things @-@ to @-@ be @-@ saved and erotic obstacles " for said men , similar to Double Indemnity ( 1944 ) and Chinatown ( 1974 ) . Slate 's Willa Paskin said True Detective 's depiction of its female characters as sex workers , the deceased , and " a nagging wife " , emphasized the " blinkered worldview and the very masculine , Southern cop culture they inhabited " . Some commentators saw Hart 's characterization as a manifestation of this idea , evident through his conventional views of women as virgins and whores , as well as his treatment of Maggie and Audrey . For example , when Hart confronts the two men who had sex with Audrey , he is in essence " charging other men a price for infringing on the daughter he sees , in a muddled way , as both deserving of protection and badly in need of being controlled . " In her analysis of season one , Salon 's Janet Turley said women " become reflections of the men " , given the True Detective universe is observed through the lenses of the show 's male leads . Sam Adams of Indiewire contended that the season 's central story focused on " the horrible things men do to women " , many of which are never reported or investigated by authorities . Adams wrote , " No one missed Dora Lange . Marie Fontenot disappeared , and the police let a rumor stop them from following up " . Furthermore , he observed that the role of women is only more profound because Cohle is made to suffer by virtue of his ex @-@ wife and deceased daughter , and Hart is unable to " deal appropriately with the women who are there " . John <unk> from Esquire argued that a significant part of the show 's thematic center was alcohol , which functions as a " measure of manliness " that reinvigorates its male characters . 
 True Detective also explores Christianity and the dichotomy between religion and rationality . Born into a devout Catholic household , Pizzolatto said that as a child he saw religion as storytelling that acts " as an escape from the truth " . According to The Daily Beast , the season alludes to Pizzolatto 's childhood and creates a parallel between Christianity and supernatural theology . " Both ... are stories . Stories people tell themselves to escape reality . Stories that ' violate every law of the universe . ' " It said this message is not critical of religion per se but religious zeal " can wind [ you ] up in some pretty sick places " . Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly said the show becomes more self @-@ aware through Cohle 's harsh critiques of religion , which he viewed as a vehicle for commentary " about pop culture escapism " . The philosopher and author Finn <unk> argued that Cohle 's evolution illustrates an affinity between Buddhism and pessimism . A self @-@ proclaimed pessimist , Cohle is eventually changed by a near @-@ death experience in the season finale , in which he has an epiphany seeing death as " pure love " ; this echoes the Buddhist concept of <unk> . 
 Critics have offered many readings of the influence of weird and horror fiction on True Detective 's narrative , specifically Robert W. Chambers ' short story collection The King in Yellow ( 1895 ) and Thomas Ligotti , as well as nihilism and pessimism . Allusions to The King in Yellow can be observed through the show 's dark underbelly , its recurring use of " <unk> " and " The Yellow King " as motifs throughout the series , and its symbolic use of yellow as a thematic signature that signifies insanity , decadence , and mental illness . The similarities between Ligotti 's work and True Detective became the center of a plagiarism scandal , in which Pizzolatto was accused of plagiarizing texts from The Conspiracy Against the Human Race ( 2010 ) . Other philosophers and writers identified as influences include Arthur Schopenhauer , Ray <unk> , Emil <unk> , and Eugene Thacker . The Atlantic said True Detective was " <unk> in the best sense " , a fusion of Se7en ( 1995 ) and Zodiac ( 2007 ) , because of its subject matter , sleek cinematography , and " vivid , unsettling " aura . 
 Some commentators noted further influences from comic book literature . Adams likened Cohle to the protagonist of Alan Moore 's The Courtyard and drew parallels with Grant Morrison 's The Invisibles for the show 's brief exploration of M @-@ theory with one of Cohle 's monologues . ComicsAlliance and New York columnist Abraham Riesman cited Top 10 as the inspiration for the season finale based on dialogue from the episode 's closing scene .

 The American press considered True Detective to be among the best television shows of 2014 . On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the first season garnered a rating of 85 percent based on 65 reviews , with an average rating of 8 @.@ 5 out of 10 . The site 's critical consensus says , " In True Detective , performances by Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey reel the viewer in , while the style , vision and direction make it hard to turn away . " On Metacritic , season one has a score of 87 out of 100 , based on 41 critics , indicating " universal acclaim " . 
 The Daily Telegraph critic Chris Harvey declared True Detective " the most ambitious TV drama for a long time " . Tim Goodman , writing for The Hollywood Reporter , identified the acting , dialogue , and sleek production as its most satisfying attributes . HitFix 's Alan Sepinwall agreed and said these qualities " speak to the value of the hybrid anthology format Pizzolatto is using here ... points to a potentially fascinating shift in dramatic series television " . In his review for Vanity Fair , Richard Lawson said the season successfully marries Fukunaga 's " portentous , heavy " sensibilities with Pizzolatto 's script , producing " a captivating and offbeat tweak of a well @-@ worn genre " . Andrew Romano in his review for The Daily Beast felt the first half of the season forms " one of the most riveting and provocative series I 've ever seen " , and by the fourth episode , Christopher Orr of The Atlantic called True Detective " the best show on TV " . 
 The ensemble performances , chiefly those of McConaughey and Harrelson , were frequently mentioned in the critiques . Robert Bianco in USA Today wrote that the pair met , and occasionally exceeded , the " enormously high " performance expectations of the " golden age of TV acting " . David Wiegand of San Francisco Chronicle thought the two men were " in a class of their own " , and Los Angeles Times journalist Robert Lloyd felt their work was of " a very high order " . The Boston Globe singled out Monaghan for her work on the show , as did Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club , who wrote , " while her role is more thankless , she invests it with spirit " . Variety 's Brian Lowry said the True Detective cast consisted of " fine players on the periphery " . RedEye , The Independent , and The Guardian also praised the ensemble performances . 
 Some reviews were not as enthusiastic as the consensus about the season . The New York Times journalist Mike Hale and Slant Magazine believed the script too readily deferred to religion as its narrative backbone . Gerald Peary of The Arts Fuse cited the writing as the show 's main flaw , so too did Michael Starr from the New York Post , whose opinion was that its pacing was " at times downright glacial " . Hank Steuver of The Washington Post said True Detective failed to realize its own ambition , while Grantland 's Andy Greenwald said despite its " radical and forward thinking " form , its narrative was " anything but " . Emily Nussbaum from The New Yorker commended the show 's fluid style but condemned its portrayal of women , which she claimed revels in " macho nonsense " . James Poniewozik of Time wrote that , despite having strong characters in Cohle and Hart , " everyone around them is much more flat " . 
 = = = Accolades = = = 
 As the nominations for the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards approached , early media reports named True Detective among several potential miniseries candidates , due to a revision made by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences that recognized film and miniseries content as distinct categories . By March 2014 , HBO had submitted True Detective as a drama series contender , an unconventional move given the show 's anthology format and fierce competition from the likes of Breaking Bad and House of Cards . HBO 's decision was censured by FX president John Landgraf , who remarked to reporters at a press event : " My own personal point of view is that a miniseries is a story that ends , a series is a story that continues . To tell you the truth , I think it ’ s actually unfair for HBO to put True Detective in the drama series category because essentially you can get certain actors to do a closed @-@ ended series – a la Billy Bob Thornton in Fargo or Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson in True Detective – who you can ’ t get to sign on for a seven @-@ year [ regular drama series ] deal . " Nevertheless , True Detective emerged as a frontrunner heading into the Primetime Emmy season , and in July 2014 , was nominated for twelve awards ; its closest rival , Breaking Bad , received sixteen nominations . The series ultimately won five Emmy awards : Outstanding Directing ( Fukunaga ) , Outstanding Casting , Outstanding Main Title Design , Outstanding Make @-@ Up , and Outstanding Cinematography . 
 In total , True Detective was a candidate for thirty @-@ seven awards recognizing outstanding achievement in direction , cinematography , writing , and acting — including a Golden Globe for Best Miniseries or Television Film and a TCA Award for Program of the Year . Of the thirty @-@ seven nominations , the show scooped up twenty @-@ four wins , among them being a British Academy Television Award ( BAFTA ) for Best International Programme , a Writers Guild of America Award in the Dramatic Series category , and a Critics ' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series ( McConaughey ) .

 = Murder of Joanna Yeates = 
 Joanna Clare Yeates ( 19 April 1985 – 17 December 2010 ) was a landscape architect from Hampshire , England , who went missing on 17 December 2010 in Bristol after an evening out with colleagues . Following a highly publicised appeal for information on her whereabouts and intensive police enquiries , her body was discovered on 25 December 2010 in Failand , North Somerset . A post @-@ mortem examination determined that she had been strangled . 
 The murder inquiry , codenamed Operation Braid , was one of the largest police investigations ever undertaken in the Bristol area . The case dominated news coverage in the United Kingdom around the Christmas period as Yeates ' family sought assistance from the public through social networking services and press conferences . Rewards amounting to £ 60 @,@ 000 were offered for information leading to those responsible for Yeates ' death . The police initially suspected and arrested Christopher Jefferies , Yeates ' landlord , who lived in a flat in the same building . He was subsequently released without charge . 
 Vincent Tabak , a 32 @-@ year @-@ old Dutch engineer and neighbour of Yeates , was arrested on 20 January 2011 . Media attention at the time centred on the filming of a re @-@ enactment of her disappearance for the BBC 's programme , Crimewatch . After two days of questioning , Tabak was charged on 22 January 2011 with Yeates ' murder . On 5 May 2011 , he pleaded guilty to Yeates ' manslaughter , but denied murdering her . His trial started on 4 October 2011 ; he was found guilty of murder on 28 October 2011 , and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 20 years . 
 The nature of press reporting on aspects of the case led to legal proceedings against several UK newspapers . Libel action was brought by Jefferies against eight publications over their coverage of his arrest , resulting in the payment to him of substantial damages . The Daily Mirror and The Sun were found guilty of contempt of court for reporting information that could prejudice a trial . A memorial service was held for Yeates at the parish church in the Bristol suburb where she lived ; her funeral took place near the family home in Hampshire . Several memorials were planned , including one in a garden she had been designing for a new hospital in Bristol . 
 = = Background and disappearance = = 
 Joanna Clare Yeates was born on 19 April 1985 to David and Teresa Yeates in Hampshire , England . She was privately educated at <unk> Park near Romsey . Yeates studied for her A @-@ levels at Peter Symonds College and graduated with a degree in landscape architecture from <unk> College . She received her Postgraduate diploma in landscape architecture from the University of Gloucestershire . 
 In December 2008 , Yeates met then @-@ 25 @-@ year @-@ old fellow landscape architect Greg Reardon at the firm Hyland Edgar Driver in Winchester . The couple moved in together in 2009 , and settled in Bristol when the company moved there . Yeates later changed jobs to work at the Building Design Partnership in Bristol . Yeates and Reardon moved into a flat at 44 Canynge Road in the city 's Clifton suburb in October 2010 . 
 At approximately 8 : 00 pm on 19 December 2010 , Reardon returned home from a weekend visit to Sheffield to find Yeates absent from their flat on Canynge Road , Clifton . Reardon had been trying to contact her by phone and text , but without success . While awaiting Yeates ' return , Reardon called her again , but her mobile phone rang from a pocket of her coat , which was still in the flat . He found that her purse and keys were also at the flat , and that their cat appeared to have been neglected . Shortly after half past midnight , Reardon contacted the police and Yeates ' parents to report her missing . 
 Investigators determined Yeates had spent the evening of 17 December 2010 with colleagues at the Bristol Ram pub on Park Street , leaving at around 8 : 00 pm to begin the 30 @-@ minute walk home . She told friends and colleagues that she was not looking forward to spending the weekend alone as it would be her first in the flat without Reardon ; she planned to spend her time baking in preparation for a party the couple would be throwing the following week , and shopping for Christmas . Yeates was seen on closed @-@ circuit television ( CCTV ) at around 8 : 10 pm leaving a Waitrose supermarket without purchasing anything . She phoned her best friend , Rebecca Scott , at 8 : 30 pm to arrange a meeting on Christmas Eve . The last known footage of Yeates recorded her buying a pizza from a branch of Tesco Express at around 8 : 40 pm . She had also bought two small bottles of cider at a nearby off @-@ licence , Bargain Booze .

 Reardon and Yeates ' friends set up a website and used social networking services to help look for her . On 21 December 2010 , Yeates ' parents and Reardon made a public appeal for her safe return at a police press conference . In another press conference , broadcast live on 23 December 2010 by Sky News and BBC News , Yeates ' father David commented on her disappearance : " I think she was abducted after getting home to her flat ... I have no idea of the circumstances of the abduction because of what was left behind ... I feel sure she would not have gone out by herself leaving all these things behind and she was taken away somewhere " . Her keys , phone , purse and coat were left behind at her flat . Detectives retrieved a receipt for a pizza , but found no sign of it or of its packaging . Both bottles of cider were found in the flat , one of them partially consumed . As there was no evidence of forced entry or a struggle , investigators began to examine the possibility that Yeates may have known her abductor . 
 On 25 December 2010 , a fully clothed body was found in the snow by a couple walking their dogs along Longwood Lane near a golf course and next to the entrance of a quarry in Failand , approximately 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from her home . The body was identified by police as that of Yeates . Reardon and the Yeates family visited the site of the discovery on 27 December 2010 . David Yeates said that the family " had been told to prepare for the worst " and expressed relief that his daughter 's body had been recovered . Funeral arrangements were delayed as investigators retained the body . The pathologist Dr Nat Carey consented to the release of the body on 31 January 2011 . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 The investigation , called " Operation Braid " , comprised 80 detectives and civilian staff under the direction of Detective Chief Inspector Phil Jones , a senior officer with Avon and Somerset Constabulary 's major crime investigation unit . It became one of the largest police operations in the Constabulary 's history . Jones urged the public to come forward with any information to help catch the killer , especially potential witnesses who were in the vicinity of Longwood Lane in Failand in the period before Yeates ' body was discovered . He stated that the investigation was seeking the driver of a " light @-@ coloured 4x4 vehicle " for questioning . 
 Jones said that officers had been " inundated with thousands of calls " and were " exhausting every lead and avenue that [ they were ] provided with . " Police examined over 100 hours of surveillance footage along with 293 tonnes ( 293 @,@ 000 kg ) of rubbish seized from the area around Yeates ' flat . Crime Stoppers offered a £ 10 @,@ 000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of her murderer , while The Sun newspaper offered £ 50 @,@ 000 . Authorities advised people living in the area to secure their homes , and warned women not to walk alone after dark . Speaking on 29 December about the murder investigation Yeates ' father said , " I fear that whoever has done this will never hand themselves in , but we live in hope that the police will catch who is responsible .

Investigators identified " striking similarities " between the Yeates and Hall cases , notably their age and appearance , and that they had disappeared after returning home from meeting friends , but the possibility of such connections was later downplayed by authorities . The police gathered surveillance video from Clifton Suspension Bridge , which forms part of the most direct route from the crime scene to the Clifton suburb where Yeates was last seen alive . The footage was of poor quality , making it impossible to clearly distinguish individuals or car registration numbers . Investigators were aware that the perpetrator could have used an alternative bridge across the River Avon less than a mile to the south to avoid CCTV coverage . 
 A post mortem examination began on 26 December 2010 , though results were delayed due to the frozen condition of the body . Police initially thought it possible that Yeates froze to death because her body showed no visible signs of injury . Investigators announced on 28 December 2010 that the case had become a murder inquiry as the pathologist who performed her autopsy determined that Yeates had died as a result of strangulation . The post mortem indicated that she had died " ... several days before being discovered " on 25 December 2010 . The examination also confirmed that Yeates did not eat the pizza she had purchased . Detective Chief Inspector Jones stated that the investigation found " ... no evidence to suggest that Joanna was sexually assaulted " . The police searched Reardon 's laptop computer and mobile phone as part of standard procedure . Reardon was ruled out as a suspect and treated as a witness . 
 A young woman attending a party at a neighbouring house on Canynge Road on the night of Yeates ' disappearance recalled hearing two loud screams shortly after 9 : 00 pm coming from the direction of Yeates ' flat . Another neighbour who lived behind Yeates ' home said that he heard a woman 's voice scream " Help me " , although he could not recall exactly when the incident had occurred . Officers removed the front door to Yeates ' flat to check for clothing fibres and DNA evidence , with investigators examining the possibility that the perpetrator had entered the flat before Yeates returned home .

 Senior officers from the investigation asked for assistance from the National Policing Improvement Agency , which provides expertise for difficult cases . On 4 January 2011 , a clinical forensic psychologist , who had previously been involved as a criminal profiler in other high profile murder cases , joined the investigation to help narrow down the number of potential suspects . Jones stated that his officers had established over 1 @,@ 000 lines of inquiry . Jones said , " I can assure you , we are determined to solve this crime and bring Jo 's killers to justice . " On 5 January , Detective Chief Inspector Jones announced that one of Yeates ' socks was missing when she was found dead and that it had not been found at the crime scene or in her home . 
 Police launched a national advertising campaign to appeal for witnesses through Facebook . The page , established on 4 January , had been viewed nearly 250 @,@ 000 times by the following day , while CCTV footage of Yeates had been viewed 120 @,@ 000 times on YouTube by 5 January . 
 On 9 January 2011 , Bristol East MP Kerry McCarthy gave her support to the idea of a public DNA screening process if the police found it useful . The Avon and Somerset Constabulary had conducted mass DNA screening during the 1995 investigation into the disappearance of then @-@ 18 @-@ year @-@ old Louise Smith . McCarthy suggested that the screening process should be extended beyond Clifton to the wider Bristol area . DNA that had been found on Yeates ' body was tested for a potential profile . Detectives also began tracking the movements of several hundred registered sex offenders living within their jurisdiction to determine the individuals ' whereabouts on 17 December .

 Shortly after 7 : 00 am on 30 December 2010 , Christopher Jefferies , Yeates ' landlord who lived in the same building , was arrested on suspicion of her murder . He was taken to a local police station for questioning while forensic investigators inspected his flat . On 31 December , a senior police officer granted investigators a 12 @-@ hour extension to the arrest , enabling them to hold him in custody for additional questioning . Police subsequently applied to magistrates for further extensions which were granted on 31 December and 1 January . Investigators were able to detain him as a suspect for up to 96 hours , but released Jefferies on bail after two days . He retained the legal services of the law firm Stokoe Partnership to act on his behalf . On 4 March 2011 , police released him from bail and stated he was no longer a suspect . He subsequently won an undisclosed sum in libel damages for defamatory news articles published following his arrest , and received an apology from Avon and Somerset Police for any distress caused to him during the investigation . 
 In January 2011 , a reconstruction of the case was filmed on location in Bristol for broadcast in the 26 January edition of the BBC television programme Crimewatch . Snow Business , a Gloucestershire @-@ based firm that had been involved in the production of the Harry Potter films was contracted to reproduce the snowy conditions at the time of Yeates ' disappearance . The reconstruction of Yeates ' last movements was filmed on 18 January , and within 24 hours of news coverage about the production , over 300 people contacted the police . A breakthrough led investigators to believe that Yeates ' body might have been transported in a large holdall or suitcase . 
 On the morning of 20 January , the Avon and Somerset Constabulary arrested 32 @-@ year @-@ old Dutch engineer Vincent Tabak , who lived with his girlfriend in the flat next door to Yeates . However , authorities declined to reveal additional details while the suspect was being interrogated due to concerns over controversial media coverage of Jefferies ' arrest , which had breached the rules governing what can be reported when an individual is arrested . The Tabak arrest followed an anonymous tip from a female caller , shortly after a televised appeal by Yeates ' parents on Crimewatch . Canynge Road was closed by police while scaffolding was constructed around Yeates ' home ; and officers sealed off Tabak 's adjacent flat . Investigators also searched the nearby townhouse of a friend , where Tabak was believed to have been staying , about a mile away . Tabak had previously been ruled out as a suspect during an earlier stage of the investigation , and had returned to Britain from a holiday visit to his family in the Netherlands . 
 Following Tabak 's arrest , the BBC cancelled its plans to air the Yeates re @-@ enactment on Crimewatch . On 31 January , previously unseen photos of Yeates were released through the programme 's website . 
 = = = DNA tests = = = 
 DNA tests were carried out by <unk> Forensics , a private company which undertakes forensic analysis for criminal investigations . Lindsey <unk> , a body fluids and DNA specialist member of the team that analysed DNA samples from Yeates ' body , said that although DNA swabs matched Tabak , they were not of sufficient quality to be evaluated . The team deployed a method known as DNA <unk> , which enhances unusable DNA samples through purification and concentration : " We couldn 't say whether the DNA was from saliva , or semen , or even touch . But we could say that the probability of it not being a match with Tabak was less than one in a billion . "

 After questioning during 96 hours of detention , Tabak was charged on 22 January 2011 with the murder of Joanna Yeates . He made a brief appearance at Bristol 's Magistrates ' Court on 24 January and was remanded in custody . Tabak , legally represented by Paul Cook , declined to request bail during a hearing the following day . Tabak was moved from Bristol Prison because of fears for his safety , and was placed under suicide watch at Long <unk> Prison near Evesham . Tabak 's family and friends in the Netherlands started to raise funds for his court defence . 
 Tabak initially maintained he was not responsible for Joanna Yeates ' death , claiming that DNA evidence linking him to the crime had been fabricated by corrupt officials . However , on 8 February , he told Peter Brotherton , a prison chaplain , that he had killed her and intended to plead guilty . 
 On 5 May 2011 , Vincent Tabak pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Yeates , but denied murdering her . His plea of guilty to manslaughter was rejected by the Crown Prosecution Service . On 20 September , Tabak appeared in person at a pre @-@ trial hearing at Bristol Crown Court . Appearances at previous hearings had been made via <unk> from prison . 
 = = = Vincent Tabak = = = 
 Vincent Tabak ( born 10 February 1978 ) was a Dutch engineer who had lived and worked in the United Kingdom since 2007 . The youngest of five siblings , he was raised in Uden , 21 miles ( 34 km ) north of Eindhoven . Tabak 's childhood next @-@ door neighbour , John <unk> , described him after the trial as an intelligent " introverted " loner . Tabak studied at Eindhoven University of Technology beginning in 1996 , graduating with an MSc in architecture , building and planning in 2003 , then began a PhD in which his thesis was a study of how people use space in office buildings and public areas . The paper was published in 2008 . 
 Leaving university in 2007 , he moved to the United Kingdom after taking a job at the headquarters of Buro Happold , an engineering consultancy firm in Bath , and settled in a flat in the town . He worked as a " people flow analyst " , a role which required him to examine how people move around public spaces such as schools , airports and sports stadia . While living in Bath he established a relationship with a woman he first met through The Guardian 's online dating website Soulmates . She was later described by the newspaper as his first serious girlfriend ; he paid tribute to her in the acknowledgements of his thesis : " I am very happy she entered my life . " The couple moved to a flat in Canynge Road , Bristol , in June 2009 . Though Joanna Yeates and her partner moved into the neighbouring flat in Canynge Road in late 2010 , she and Tabak did not meet prior to 17 December . 
 After killing Yeates , Tabak attempted to cast suspicion for the murder onto Jefferies after watching a news broadcast about the case while spending the New Year with relatives in the Netherlands . He contacted Avon and Somerset Police to tell them that Jefferies had been using his car on the night of 17 December , and a CID officer , DC Karen Thomas , was sent to Amsterdam to talk to him . They met at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport on 31 December , where Tabak elaborated on his story , but Thomas grew suspicious of his interest in the forensic work being carried out by the police and because what he said did not concur with a previous statement . 
 In the months leading up to Yeates ' death , Tabak had used his computer to research escort agencies during business trips in the United Kingdom and United States , and contacted several prostitutes by phone . He also viewed violent internet pornography that depicted women being controlled by men , showing images of them being bound and gagged , held by the neck and choked . During the murder investigation , police found images of a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Yeates . In one scene she was shown pulling up a pink top to expose her bra and breasts . When Yeates was discovered , she was wearing a similarly arranged pink top . 
 At Tabak 's trial , prosecuting barrister Nigel Lickley QC , argued that the evidence of Tabak 's activities should be provided to the jury : " It might shed light on the need to hold a woman for long enough and the need to squeeze hard enough to take her life . " Details of Tabak 's viewing of pornography were not included in the prosecution 's case since the judge believed it did not prove that Tabak had acted with premeditation . After the trial it was disclosed that images of child pornography had been found on Tabak 's laptop . In December 2013 , the Crown Prosecution Service announced that he would be prosecuted for possessing the material . On 2 March 2015 , Tabak pleaded guilty to possessing indecent images of children , and was sentenced to 10 months in jail . 
 = = = Trial = = = 
 The trial of Vincent Tabak started on 4 October 2011 at the Crown Court at Bristol before Mr Justice Field and a jury . His counsel in the trial was William Clegg QC and the prosecutor was Nigel Lickley QC . Tabak pleaded guilty to manslaughter , but denied murder . 
 The prosecution case was that Tabak had strangled Yeates at her flat within minutes of her arrival home on 17 December 2010 , using " sufficient force " to kill her . The prosecutors stated that Tabak – around a foot ( 30 cm ) taller than Yeates – had used his height and build to overpower her , pinning her to the floor by the wrists , and that she had suffered 43 separate injuries to her head , neck , torso and arms during the struggle . The injuries included cuts , bruises , and a fractured nose . Lickley told the court that the struggle was lengthy , and her death would have been slow and painful . However , he did not offer an explanation for the reasoning behind Tabak 's initial attack on Yeates . 
 Evidence was presented that Tabak had then tried to conceal the crime by disposing of her body . The court heard that DNA swabs taken from Yeates ' body had provided a match with Tabak . Samples found behind the knees of her jeans indicated she may have been held by the legs as she was carried , while fibres suggested contact with Tabak 's coat and car . Blood stains were found on a wall overlooking a quarry close to where Yeates was discovered . The prosecution also said that Tabak attempted to implicate Jefferies for the murder during the police investigation , and that in the days following Yeates ' death , he had made internet searches for topics that included the length of time a body takes to decompose and the dates of refuse collections in the Clifton area . 
 In his defence , Tabak claimed that the killing had not been sexually motivated , and told the court that he had killed Yeates while trying to silence her after she screamed when he tried to kiss her . He claimed that Yeates had made a " flirty comment " and invited him to drink with her . He said that after she screamed he held his hands over her mouth and around her neck to silence her . He denied suggestions of a struggle , claiming to have held Yeates by the neck with only minimal force , and " ... for about 20 seconds " . He told the court that after dumping the body he was " ... in a state of panic " . 
 The jury was sent out to deliberate on 26 October , and returned with a verdict two days later . On 28 October 2011 , Tabak was found guilty of Joanna Yeates ' murder by a 10 to 2 majority verdict . He was jailed for life , with a minimum term of 20 years . Passing sentence , Mr Justice Field referred to a " sexual element " to the killing . 
 = = Media controversy = = 
 The manner in which certain aspects of the case were reported by the British media led to television broadcaster ITN being temporarily banned from attending press conferences , and the instigation of legal proceedings against several newspapers by both Yeates ' former landlord , and the Attorney General . 
 Following a television news report on 4 January 2011 that criticised the handling of the investigation , ITN reporters were banned by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary from attending a press conference convened to give updates on the murder case . The item , presented by journalist Geraint Vincent , claimed police had made little progress with their investigation , and questioned whether they were following correct procedural methods . A former murder squad detective told the report that " certain routine inquiries " such as looking for fresh evidence at the crime scene were not being carried out . ITN accused the police of attempting " to censor what information we can broadcast " while the constabulary filed a complaint with the Office of Communications , calling the broadcast " unfair , naïve and irresponsible reporting " . The police subsequently lifted the sanctions against ITN , but said that they would " not hesitate to adopt similar tactics in the future . " Legal action was also considered over a tweet revealing that Tabak had viewed internet pornography showing erotic asphyxiation and bondage . The contempt of court charges were dropped after the tweet was removed . 
 Writing in London 's Evening Standard on 5 January 2011 , media commentator Roy Greenslade expressed concern over a number of negative articles that had appeared in newspapers concerning Yeates ' landlord , Jefferies , following his arrest , describing the coverage as " character assassination on a large scale " . He cited several examples of headlines and stories that had been published , including a headline in The Sun describing Jefferies – a former schoolmaster at Clifton College – as weird , posh , lewd and creepy ; a story from the Daily Express quoting unnamed former pupils referring to him as " ... a sort of Nutty Professor " who made them feel " creeped out " by his " strange " behaviour ; and an article from the Daily Telegraph , which reported Jefferies " has been described by pupils at Clifton College ... as a fan of dark and violent avant @-@ garde films " . Jefferies launched legal action against six newspapers on 21 April – The Sun , the Daily Mirror , the Daily Star , the Daily Express , the Daily Mail and the Daily Record – seeking damages for libel . 
 He was represented by Louis <unk> of the law firm Simons Muirhead and Burton , who in 2008 had successfully acted for Robert Murat after he became a suspect during the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann and had faced similar media scrutiny . On 29 July Jefferies accepted " substantial " damages for defamation from The Sun , the Daily Mirror , the Sunday Mirror , the Daily Record , the Daily Mail , the Daily Express , the Daily Star and The Scotsman in connection with their coverage of his arrest . In an interview following Tabak 's conviction , Jefferies commented : " It has taken up a whole year virtually of my life , that period of time has meant that everything else that I would normally be doing has been in abeyance . " He criticised the government 's plans to change the law on legal aid , which he said would prevent people with limited means from taking action against newspapers . 
 Dominic Grieve , the Attorney General for England and Wales , stated on 31 December 2010 that he was considering action under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 to enforce the obligation of the media not to prejudice a possible future trial . Criminology professor David Wilson commented on the resonance of the murder case with the national news media : " The British public loves a whodunnit ... It 's a particularly British thing . We were the first nation to use murder stories to sell newspapers and that culture is more ingrained here than elsewhere . " Wilson called Yeates , a white female professional , an " ideal victim " for the media . On 1 January , Yeates ' boyfriend Greg Reardon commented on the media coverage surrounding the arrest of Jefferies : " Jo 's life was cut short tragically but the finger @-@ pointing and character assassination by social and news media of as yet innocent men has been shameful . " 
 On 12 May 2011 , the Administrative Court granted the Attorney General permission to move a motion for committal for contempt of court against The Sun and the Daily Mirror for the way they had reported the arrest of Jefferies . On 29 July , the court ( Lord Judge CJ , Thomas LJ and Owen J ) ruled that both newspapers had been in contempt of court , and fined the Daily Mirror £ 50 @,@ 000 and The Sun £ 18 @,@ 000 . The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales , Lord Judge , stated that " in our judgment , as a matter of principle , the vilification of a suspect under arrest is a potential impediment to the course of justice . " The publishers of The Sun and the Daily Mirror subsequently appealed their fines , but the Mirror case was rejected by the Supreme Court of England and Wales on 9 March 2012 , whilst The Sun withdrew its appeal . 
 = = = Ramifications = = = 
 The Yeates case was mentioned during a Parliamentary debate on a private member 's bill that would have imposed a six @-@ month sentence on any journalist who names an uncharged suspect . The proposed legislation was introduced into the House of Commons in June 2010 , by Anna <unk> , the Conservative MP for <unk> , a former journalist and criminal law barrister . In a debate on 4 February 2011 <unk> told the House : " What we saw in Bristol was , in effect , a feeding frenzy and vilification . Much of the coverage was not only completely irrelevant , but there was a homophobic tone to it which I found deeply offensive . The slurs on the man were out of order . " She withdrew the proposal after encountering opposition from the Conservative @-@ led coalition government . 
 Jefferies gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry , established by Prime Minister David Cameron to investigate the ethics and behaviour of the British media following the News of the World phone hacking affair . Jefferies told the inquiry that reporters had " besieged " him after he was questioned by the police ; he said : " It was clear that the tabloid press had decided that I was guilty of Miss Yeates ' murder and seemed determined to persuade the public of my guilt . They embarked on a frenzied campaign to blacken my character by publishing a series of very serious allegations about me which were completely untrue . " Appearing before the same inquiry on 16 January 2012 , the Daily Mirror editor , Richard Wallace , described the newspaper 's coverage of Jefferies ' arrest as a " black mark " on his editing record . 
 = = Aftermath and memorials = = 
 Associate vicar Dan Clark led a memorial service for Yeates at Christ Church in Clifton on 2 January 2011 . Prayers for her were also said at the church on 17 December 2011 , the first anniversary of her death , while visitors left tributes and messages of condolence for her family . Greg Reardon started a charity website in Yeates ' memory to raise funds on behalf of families of missing people . Yeates ' friends and family planted a memorial garden at the Sir Harold Hillier Gardens in Romsey where she had worked as a student . Building Design Partnership and the local NHS trust announced plans to commemorate her with a memorial in a garden she had been designing for a new £ 430 million hospital in Southmead , Bristol . 
 Other plans for memorials included a garden of remembrance at the BDP firm 's studio in Bristol , a published anthology of Yeates ' work and an annual landscape design prize named after her for students of the University of Gloucestershire . BDP announced it would dedicate a charity cycle ride between its offices on its 50th anniversary , with proceeds to go to charities selected by her family . Yeates left behind an estate valued at £ 47 @,@ 000 , which included money set aside to purchase a home with Reardon . As she had not written a will , the sum was inherited by her parents . 
 Following the release of her body on 31 January 2011 , Yeates ' family arranged to hold her funeral at St Mark 's of <unk> , Hampshire , and have her interred in the churchyard . Yeates was buried on 11 February ; approximately 300 people attended the service , which was led by vicar Peter Gilks . 
 In 2013 , ITV commissioned a drama about Jefferies ' arrest . Filming of the two @-@ part series , starring Jason Watkins in the leading role , began in November . The Bristol Post reported that Jefferies had read and approved the script , and supported the project . The drama , titled The Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies , aired on 10 and 11 December 2014 . In May 2015 , it won two awards at the 2015 British Academy Television Awards — best mini @-@ series for the programme itself , and best actor for Watkins ' portrayal of Jefferies . On 26 March 2015 , the case was the subject of an episode of the Channel 5 documentary series Countdown to Murder , titled The Killer Next Door : The Last Hours of Joanna Yeates .

 The following locations were pertinent to the investigation : 
 = Battle of Chonan = 
 The Battle of Chonan was the third engagement between United States and North Korean forces during the Korean War . It occurred on the night of July 7 / 8 , 1950 in the village of Chonan in western South Korea . The fight ended in a North Korean victory after intense fighting around the town , which took place throughout the night and into the morning . 
 The United States Army 's 34th Infantry Regiment , 24th Infantry Division was assigned to delay elements of the North Korean People 's Army 's 4th Infantry Division as it advanced south following its victories at the Battle of Osan and the Battle of Pyongtaek the days before . The regiment emplaced north and south of Chonan attempting to delay the North Koreans in an area where the terrain formed a bottleneck between mountains and the Yellow Sea . 
 The 3rd Battalion , 34th Infantry set up a defensive perimeter north of the city , and by nightfall was engaged in combat with superior numbers of North Korean troops and tanks . American forces , unable to repulse North Korean armor , soon found themselves in an intense urban fight as columns of North Korean troops , spearheaded by T @-@ 34 tanks , entered the town from two directions , cutting off U.S. forces . The fight resulted in the near destruction of the 3rd Battalion , 34th Infantry as well as the death of the 34th Infantry Regiment 's new commander , Colonel Robert R. Martin . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Outbreak of war = = = 
 On the night of June 25 , 1950 , 10 divisions of the North Korean People 's Army launched a full @-@ scale invasion on the nation 's neighbor to the south , the Republic of Korea . The force of 89 @,@ 000 men moved in six columns , catching the Republic of Korea Army completely by surprise , resulting in a disastrous rout for the South Koreans , who were disorganized , ill @-@ equipped , and unprepared for war . Numerically superior , North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38 @,@ 000 South Korean soldiers on the front , advancing steadily south . Most of South Korea 's forces retreated in the face of the invasion , and by June 28 , the North Koreans had captured Seoul , South Korea 's capital , forcing the government and its shattered forces to withdraw south . 
 The United Nations Security Council voted to send assistance to the collapsing country . United States President Harry S. Truman subsequently ordered ground troops into the nation . However , U.S. forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II five years earlier . At the time , the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army , which was performing occupation duty in Kyushu , Japan under the command of William F. Dean . However , the division was under strength , and was only two @-@ thirds the size of its regular wartime size . Most of the 24th Infantry Division 's equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending following World War II . In spite of these deficiencies , the 24th Infantry Division was ordered into South Korea , with a mission to take the initial " shock " of North Korean advances while the rest of the Eighth Army could arrive in Korea and establish a perimeter . 
 = = = Early engagements = = = 
 From the 24th Infantry Division , one battalion was assigned to be airlifted into Korea via C @-@ 54 Skymaster transport aircraft and move quickly to block advancing North Korean forces while the remainder of the division was transported to South Korea on ships . The 21st Infantry Regiment was determined to be the most combat @-@ ready of the 24th Infantry Division 's three regiments , and the 21st Infantry 's 1st Battalion was selected because its commander , Lieutenant Colonel Charles B. Smith , was the most experienced , having commanded a battalion at the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II . On July 5 , Task Force Smith engaged North Korean forces at the Battle of Osan , delaying over 5 @,@ 000 North Korean infantry for seven hours before being routed and forced back . 
 During that time , the 34th Infantry Regiment set up a line between the villages of Pyongtaek and Ansong , 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of Osan , to fight the next delaying action against the advancing North Korean forces . 34th Infantry Regiment was similarly unprepared for a fight ; in the ensuing action , most of the regiment withdrew to Chonan without ever engaging the enemy . The 1st Battalion , left alone against the North Koreans , resisted their advance in the brief and disastrous Battle of Pyongtaek . The 34th Infantry was unable to stop North Korean armor , because equipment had not arrived that could penetrate the thick armor of the T @-@ 34 tank . After a 30 @-@ minute fight , the battalion mounted a disorganized retreat , with many soldiers abandoning equipment and running away without resisting the North Korean forces . The U.S. forces at Pyongtaek and Ansong were unable to delay the North Korean force significantly or inflict significant casualties on the enemy .

 = = = Opening moves = = = 
 Having pushed back U.S. forces at both Osan and Pyongtaek , the North Korean 4th Infantry Division , supported by elements of the North Korean 105th Armored Division , continued their advance down the Osan – Chonan road , up to 12 @,@ 000 men strong under division commander Lee Kwon Mu in two infantry regiments supported by dozens of tanks . They were well trained , well equipped , and had high morale following previous victories , giving them advantages over the poorly trained and inexperienced Americans . 
 Following the retreat from Pyongtaek , the scattered 1st Battalion , 34th Infantry retreated to Chonan , where the rest of the 34th Infantry Regiment was located . Also at the town were elements of the 1st Battalion , 21st Infantry that had not made up Task Force Smith at the Battle of Osan . Brigadier General George B. Barth , 24th Infantry Division 's artillery commander , ordered the 1st Battalion , 21st Infantry to hold positions 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) south of town before Barth left for Taejon . The 1st Battalion , 34th Infantry was sent to join it . At the same time , L Company of the 3rd Battalion , 34th Infantry was ordered to probe north of the city and meet the advancing elements of the North Korean 4th Infantry Division . Major General Dean , commander of the 24th Infantry Division , telegraphed the command from Taejon , ordering the rest of 3rd Battalion , 34th Infantry to move up behind L Company . Regimental commander Colonel Jay B. Lovless moved north to join L Company , along with newly arrived Colonel Robert R. Martin , a friend of Dean 's . Shortly before noon , 1st Battalion , 21st Infantry was ordered to withdraw southeast to Chochiwon to keep the railway and supply line to Chonan open . This left 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 34th Infantry alone in Chonan . By this time , most of the South Korean troops and civilians had abandoned the region , leaving only the U.S. forces to oppose the North Korean Army . 
 At around 1300 , L Company of 3rd Battalion , 34th Infantry was 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north of Chonan when it was hit with North Korean small arms fire . Around this time , Martin received a message from Dean that around 50 North Korean T @-@ 34 tanks were at Ansong , along with a significant number of North Korean trucks . Large numbers of troops were now located in the villages of <unk> , Myon and <unk> @-@ ni , and moving to flank Chonan from both sides . Martin and Lovless returned to the 34th Infantry 's command post , as the 3rd Battalion , 34th Infantry began setting up defensive positions several miles north of Chonan under the command of 34th Infantry Operations Officer John J. Dunn . The battalion briefly retreated when around 50 North Korean scouts began assaulting its positions , leaving behind several wounded men and equipment , including a wounded Dunn who was captured by the North Koreans . It was two hours before the main North Korean force advanced through this position . The battalion returned to Chonan in disorder . By 1700 , it re @-@ established defensive positions on the northern and western edges of the town , around a railroad station . The 1st Battalion , still disorganized and under @-@ equipped after its engagement at Pyongtaek the day before , remained in defensive positions south of the town . It would not see combat in Chonan . Around 1800 , Dean ordered Martin to take command of the 34th Infantry Regiment from Lovless . 
 = = = North Korean attack = = = 
 Throughout the evening of July 7 , North Korean pressure developed from the west edge of town . Around 2000 a column of North Korean tanks and infantry approached the town from the east . The column was hit by shells from the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion , which was supporting the 34th Infantry with 105 mm Howitzers firing white phosphorus and High Explosive Anti Tank shells . The 63rd Field Artillery Battalion was able to destroy two of the tanks , but by midnight the column had infiltrated Chonan . The 63rd Field Artillery continued to fire white phosphorus throughout the night , illuminating the terrain for the U.S. forces and preventing them from being overrun . After midnight , the North Korean force was able to cut off 80 men , including Martin , from the rest of the U.S. force , and Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. <unk> , the regimental executive officer , took command and contacted Dean requesting additional ammunition . By 0220 on July 8 Martin had returned to the town and the supply road to Taejon was reopened . 
 Within a few hours , a second column of infantry assaulted the town from the northwest . Five or six tanks at the head of the column infiltrated Chonan and began destroying all vehicles in sight , as well as any buildings suspected of harboring Americans . Around 0600 , infantry from the northwest column began flooding into the city and engaged in an intense and confused battle with the 3rd Battalion , 34th Infantry Regiment in the streets of Chonan . 3rd Battalion managed to destroy two of the tanks with rockets and grenades , but the column was able to cut off two companies of the 3rd Battalion from the rest of the force . Around 0800 , Martin was killed by a North Korean tank when he fired a 2 @.@ 36 @-@ inch bazooka at a North Korean T @-@ 34 tank at the same time it fired its main cannon at the building he was in . He had been in command of the 34th Infantry Regiment for only 14 hours . The tank was undamaged by Martin 's shot , as the weapon was obsolete and could not penetrate T @-@ 34 armor . 
 = = = American withdrawal = = = 
 After Martin 's death , the 3rd Battalion , 34th Infantry began to buckle as increasing numbers of North Korean troops flooded into Chonan from the Northwest and eastern roads . The battalion suffered heavy casualties , but was saved by the continuous fire laid down by the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion . Between 0800 and 1000 , U.S. units began a disorganized retreat from the town , many soldiers deserting their units and running from the battle . <unk> , now in command of the 34th Infantry , moved 3rd Battalion to a collecting point south of the town , where 1st Battalion , 34th Infantry was holding a blocking position and had not been engaged . As 3rd Battalion , 34th Infantry began to pull back to rally points , 1st Battalion began to come under mortar fire from North Korean forces , but withdrew without engaging them . 
 As this was happening , General Dean arrived south of the town with Lieutenant General Walton Walker to observe the conflict , and the final elements of the 34th leave Chonan . Dean ordered the 34th Infantry Regiment to retreat to the Kum River . 3rd Battalion , 34th Infantry , now down to 175 men , had lost two thirds of its strength in Chonan , around 350 men . Most of the battalion 's heavy equipment including mortars and machine guns were also lost . The North Korean radio reported 60 Americans were taken prisoner in the town . The regiment began its retreat in the late afternoon , with North Korean forces moving on ridges parallel to the regiment . Most of the battalion moved out on foot and by truck , resting on the evening of July 8 before arriving at the Kum River July 9 and setting up new defensive positions . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The 34th Infantry pulled back to the Kum River , its two battalions having been mauled in the battles of Pyongtaek and Chonan . It was able to delay North Korean forces for 14 – 20 hours , allowing the 21st Infantry Regiment to set up the next delaying action at Chonui and Chochiwon . The 34th Infantry subsequently set up defensive fortifications along the Kum River , resting for several days until it was engaged in the Battle of Taejon , and were principally in charge of the defense of the city as the weakened 21st Infantry and 19th Infantry were less prepared for the fight . The battle at Taejon resulted in the near destruction of the 24th Infantry Division . Although the force was badly defeated militarily , the 24th Infantry Division accomplished its mission of delaying North Korean forces from advancing until July 20 . By that time , American forces had set up a defensive perimeter along the Naktong River and Taegu to the southeast , known as the Pusan Perimeter . This perimeter saw the next phase of the battle and the ultimate defeat of the North Korean army in the Battle of Pusan Perimeter . 
 Robert R. Martin , the 34th Infantry Regiment 's commanding officer during the battle , was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions at Chonan , the first such decoration awarded during the Korean War . 
 = Ian Browne ( cyclist ) = 
 Ian Browne , also known as " Joey " Browne ( born 22 June 1931 ) is a former Australian track cyclist who along with Tony Marchant won the 2000 m tandem event at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne . Unusually tall and strongly built for a cyclist , Browne had little formal training and won his first Australian title in 1953 in the 10 mile event . Browne did not team up with Marchant until early in 1956 and they promptly won the tandem event at the national championships to earn national selection . The pair were eliminated after losing their first two races but were given a reprieve when the Soviet Union pair were hospitalised in a crash and forced to withdraw . Thereafter Marchant and Browne were unbeaten and progressed to an unlikely Olympic gold . Browne 's combination with Marchant was broken after the Olympics when the latter retired . In 1958 , Browne won the 10 mile event at the national titles and went on to win the event at the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games . Browne went on to compete in the 1960 and 1964 Olympics in the tandem event , both times with new partners , but both times he was eliminated in the repechage round . In 1964 , he became the oldest ever track cyclist to represent Australia at the Olympics at the age of 33 . He won the last of his national titles at the age of 37 in 1968 in the tandem event but was overlooked for Olympic selection by Australian officials . He retired and later was involved in cycling administration . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Browne was born in Melbourne to Linda and Alex Browne , the second of three brothers . His father was a printer and Browne took his elementary education at Chatham Public School , before moving on to Box Hill High School and later took his university education at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology ( RMIT ) . While he was at university , he also worked in Sunshine as a laboratory assistant at <unk> . At the age of 20 , he graduated from RMIT and took a job at the State Electricity Commission , where he worked for over 35 years continuously since then , always riding his bicycle to work , a daily journey of around 15 km . 
 Browne learned to ride a bicycle at the age of four , but did not enter his first formal cycling competition until the age of 16 , when he joined the Hawthorne Amateur Cycling Club . Browne made a habit of riding to training with his ordinary bike with heavy wheels to the club , carrying the lighter racing tyres on his back and changing his tyres upon his arrival . He earned extra money to fund a bicycle upgrade by working as a newspaper boy . There was little formal coaching at the club , and the cyclists learned by individual application and by watching and copying others . Browne and his club @-@ mates raced on Saturdays and trained on Sundays . 
 Browne had his first success at a major competition when he won the 10 mile at his first Australian Championships in 1953 . He did not team up with Tony Marchant until the start of 1956 , just ten months before the start of the Melbourne Olympics . Marchant had risen to prominence by winning the 500 m time trial at the 1955 Australian Championships for juniors , prompting Browne to select him as his partner based on his raw speed . For a final test run before formally committing to racing together , the pair simply had a few tandem sprints around the track , with Browne sitting in the front seat . They were a contrasting pair ; Marchant was a short man of 170 cm ( 5 @.@ 6 ft ) and 65 kg ( 143 lb ) , while Browne stood at 186 cm ( 6 @.@ 10 ft ) and 86 kg ( 190 lb ) , unusually tall for a cyclist . The pair went on to win the 2000 metre ( m ) tandem event at the Australian Championships in 1956 , but going into the Melbourne Olympics , nobody , themselves included , regarded them as realistic medal chances . However , their mentor , former champion Billy Guyatt convinced them that they had the potential to make progress at international level . 
 Their training schedule consisted of individual training two or three times a week and two days a week of coordinated tandem training during the Olympic year . Marchant 's main tactical responsibility was to look to the outside for impending attacks while Browne patrolled the inside . Marchant devised a signal system , such as a head bump on Browne 's hip , or even a verbal shout when the opposition made a move . 
 = = Olympic gold = = 
 Ten nations were entered in the tandem competition , and in the first round , they were drawn with Germany and South Africa , who fielded their silver medallist pairing of Tom <unk> and Ray Robinson from the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki . The Australians made their move too early and led at the ringing of the bell at the start of the last lap , but they were overhauled well before the line as they faded in the final straight . Browne and Marchant were given another chance in the repechage round later in the same day . The Australians lead for three quarters of the distance , but were overhauled by their Czechoslovakian opponent in the final metres and were defeated in a photo finish . This would normally have meant that the Australians would have been eliminated , however the final repechage between the Soviet Union and the Germans resulted in a tangle , resulting in a heavy pile @-@ up . Neither teams finished the race , but the Soviets were hospitalised . The cycling officials decided that the bruised Germans would be forced to compete in a repechage sequel against the losers in the previous repechages to qualify . This allowed the United States and the Australians a reprieve . 
 The Australians seized their good fortune and set their fastest time to date with 11 @.@ 0 seconds ( s ) . Having been beaten twice after leading out , the Australians sat back before sweeping past the injured Germans and the Americans in the final lap . Australia were again drawn against South Africa in their quarter @-@ final , who had defeated them easily in the heats . This time they equalled the fastest team in the competition over the final 200 m , clocking 10 @.@ 8 s to progress to the final , where they faced the Italy . Giuseppe Ogna and Cesare Pinarello appeared to be in control at the start of the final lap . They had moved alongside the Australians with one and a half laps to go , but the Australians surprised them at the start of the final lap . The Italians came back to pull level at the start of the back straight , but the Australians held them off and pulled away to win by a length and a half . The Italians lodged a protest for interference but it was dismissed . The Australians finished in a time of 10 @.@ 8 s and Browne later claimed that he was convinced by the performance that they would win the gold medal . 
 The final took place on the third day of racing . The Australians came to the conclusion that their wheels and tyres were too heavy , so they sought to buy better cycling equipment from the defeated Germans . The Germans agreed , saying " Have ours and you will win the gold medal . " Australia were again pitted against the Czechoslovak Vaclav Machek and Ladislav <unk> . One of the reasons behind Australia 's return to form had been the return of Guyatt to a mentoring role . Guyatt had assisted them at the national championships , but they were assigned to another coach at the Olympics . Guyatt was regarded as a marketing @-@ style motivator and he attempted to give Browne and Marchant a psychological boost . Equipped with their new machines , Browne and Marchant employed a tactical trick devised by Guyatt . The Australian staff had noticed that the Czechoslovaks had always made their final burst from a certain point from the finish . During the final , Australian team manager Bill Young stood at the said point as the Australian led out . When Browne came to the point , he pulled upwards and pre @-@ emptively blocked the expected Czechoslovakian attack . This helped to stifle the attack and Australia went on to win the gold medal . 
 = = Later career = = 
 Following the Olympics , Marchant retired , and Browne went on to win the individual 10 mile race at the 1958 Australian Championships . Browne went to the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games at Cardiff in Wales . He was unplaced in the sprint , but won the 10 mile race to collect a gold medal . Browne had intended to retire after returning from Cardiff , but the lure of a second Olympics proved too much . In 1960 , he won the 2000 m tandem with Geoff Smith at the Australian Championships and was selected for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome . There was to be no repeat of the triumph in Melbourne , as the pair were eliminated in the second repechage . Since no other Australian older than 28 had ever represented the nation in cycling , Browne was the oldest ever male cyclist to represent Australia at the Olympics . Browne continued to the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth , Western Australia , but was unable to win a gold in front of his home crowd , finishing with a bronze in the sprint . In 1964 , Browne again won the tandem event at the Australian Championships , combining with his new partner Daryl Perkins . The pair then went to the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo , where Browne beat his own mark of being the oldest cyclist to represent Australia at the Olympics , at the age of 33 . This time , the Australians were eliminated in the quarter @-@ final . Browne continued to compete at national level , successfully defending the tandem title in 1965 , this time with a new partner Gordon Johnson . He won his fifth and final tandem and his last Australian Championship in 1968 with Johnson , but the Australian selectors overlooked Browne , instead selecting Hilton Clarke to partner Johnson in the tandem at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City , ending Browne 's career . 
 Browne was regarded as an intelligent and meticulous athlete , who was known for a logical and somewhat introspective style in his approach to the sport . He felt that he did not have the raw speed to match the likes of Lionel Cox and Dick Ploog in vying for selection in Australia 's sprint team , and that he was not suited to long road races , instead focusing on medium length track racing . Browne typically was the front rider in tandem races , liking to be in control . He was regarded to be a cyclist who behaved in a careful and scholarly manner , and was known for coaxing higher levels of performance out of his younger partners . Browne was respected for his technical knowledge of the tandem and his success was often attributed to his vast experience . 
 = = After cycling = = 
 In his retirement , Browne continued his involvement in the sport , using his vast experience to serve the sport as an administrator . Browne served as the Vice President of the Victorian Amateur Cycling Association and he strongly advocated the use of a handicap system in racing , believing that it would improve the standard of racing and improve Australia 's success rate . At the age of 39 , he married Rhonda , a primary school teacher . They had three children , a girl and two boys . 
 = Little Wing = 
 " Little Wing " is a song written by Jimi Hendrix and recorded by the Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1967 . It is a slower tempo , rhythm and blues @-@ inspired ballad featuring Hendrix 's vocal and guitar with recording studio effects accompanied by bass , drums , and glockenspiel . Lyrically , it is one of several of his songs that reference an idealized feminine or guardian angel @-@ like figure . At about two and a half minutes in length , it is one of his most concise and melodically @-@ focused pieces . 
 The origins of " Little Wing " have been traced back to the 1966 recording of " ( My Girl ) She 's a Fox " , an R & B song which features Hendrix playing Curtis Mayfield @-@ influenced guitar accompaniment . He developed the song while performing in New York City 's Greenwich Village prior to his involvement with producer Chas Chandler . After being inspired by events at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival , Hendrix completed the song in October 1967 , when it was recorded by the Experience during the sessions for their second album Axis : Bold as Love . 
 " Little Wing " was released with the Axis album in December 1967 in the UK and the following month in the US . As one of only two songs from the album to become part of the Experience 's concert repertoire , the Experience often performed it live and recordings were issued on early Hendrix posthumous albums Hendrix in the West in 1972 and The Jimi Hendrix Concerts in 1982 . More recently , demo versions have been released as well as additional live renditions . " Little Wing " is one of Hendrix 's most popular songs and has become a standard , with interpretations recorded by musicians in a variety of styles . It is ranked number 366 on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the " 500 Greatest Songs of All Time " . 
 = = Background = = 
 Jimi Hendrix began his career as a rhythm and blues guitarist and performed and recorded with several popular R & B artists , including the Isley Brothers , Don Covay , and Little Richard . He learned from other R & B guitarists , including Curtis Mayfield , who was known for his understated rhythmic fills and chording . Hendrix toured as a support act with Mayfield in 1963 . He described the experience : " The best gig was with Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions . Curtis was a really good guitarist ... I learned a lot in that short time . He probably influenced me more than anyone I 'd ever played with up to that time , that sweet sound of his , you know " . In 1966 , Hendrix recorded a song titled " ( My Girl ) She 's a Fox " with the <unk> , an R & B duo . Hendrix biographer Harry Shapiro has described it as " paced and phrased in the style of Curtis Mayfield , [ that ] is virtually a blueprint for ' Little Wing ' " . Later Hendrix producer John McDermott called his contribution to " She 's a Fox " ( included on the 2010 West Coast Seattle Boy : The Jimi Hendrix Anthology ) " perhaps the strongest of his pre @-@ Experience career . Hendrix 's Curtis Mayfield @-@ influenced guitar styling is the song 's strongest attribute " . 
 According to Hendrix , " Little Wing " came from an idea he had originally developed while playing in Greenwich Village , when he was fronting his band Jimmy James and the Blue Flames in the summer of 1966 . He later explained that he was further inspired during the Experience 's performance at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival : 
 I got the idea like , when we were in Monterey and I was just looking at everything around . So I figured that I take everything I see around and put it maybe in the form of a girl maybe , somethin ' like that , you know , and call it ' Little Wing ' , and then it will just fly away . Everybody 's really flyin ' and they 're really in a nice mood , like the police and everybody was really , really great out there . So I just took all these things an put them in one very , very small little matchbox , you know , into a girl and then do it . It was very simple , but I like it though . 
 = = Recording and composition = = 
 In October 1967 , recording sessions for the second Jimi Hendrix Experience album Axis : Bold as Love began at Olympic Studios in London . On October 25 , after recording the strongly R & B @-@ oriented " Wait Until Tomorrow " , the Experience recorded an instrumental version of " Little Wing " . It followed the same chord progression as the later master recording , but had a more forceful rock feel . After another take in the same vein , Chandler called for a different approach . Recording engineer Eddie Kramer explained , " Chas knew right away what was needed . He had Jimi slow the tempo down and try it again " . After the basic track was completed , Hendrix and Kramer recorded overdubs on October 28 , 1967 . For his recordings , Hendrix expended considerable effort to achieve the optimal tone for his guitar tracks . For his rhythm guitar , he had set his pickup selector to a nonstandard position between the neck and middle settings to achieve a " hollow " tone , sometimes mistakenly referred to as " out @-@ of @-@ phase " . However , for the lead , Kramer later fed the guitar signal through a makeshift Leslie speaker , which was normally used for electric organs . By rotating the sound , Leslie speakers produce <unk> and tremolo @-@ like effects , i.e. , a pulsing or quivering addition to the sound ( Hendrix later popularized the use of the <unk> phase shifter effects pedal , which can be set to get a roughly similar effect ) . Next , Hendrix added a straight ( " dry , without any effects " ) glockenspiel to underscore his vocal and guitar . According to Kramer , " Jimi always kept an eye out for odd instruments that would be laying about the studio " and found the glockenspiel in Studio A. Last to be recorded was his vocal , which was treated with sound processing techniques to give it an airy sound . These have been variously described as artificial double tracking ( ADT ) , phasing , Pultec filter equalization , and processing with a Leslie speaker . 
 Regarding the song 's arrangement , Shapiro commented , " Musically , ' Little Wing ' is structured to lay a gossamer touch across the whole song from the arresting opening statement and the haunting glockenspiel to the use of a Leslie speaker cabinet for the guitar " . According to AllMusic 's Matthew Greenwald , it is based on a " gentle , soulful chord progression [ which ] guides the melody and is an accurate mirror of the title and lyrics " . The song has been notated in 4 / 4 time with one bar in 2 / 4 at a slow rock ( 70 – 72 beats per minute ) tempo and is built on a chord progression without a bridge section : 
 After an instrumental introduction , there are two verses , followed by a guitar solo , which has been described as " richly melodic " by biographer Keith Shadwick . Shapiro noted the song 's brevity : " The song fades on a magical solo after only two minutes and twenty @-@ five seconds . Even live , ' Little Wing ' was hardly any longer – he said what he wanted to say and stopped " . 
 Hendrix 's use of guitar chords for the song involves unconventional finger positions and approach to the fretboard . Guitarist Frank Marino explained : 
 He had the tendency to play with his fingers very flat [ on the guitar 's fretboard ] , and he had a very long thumb , so he could come over the top of the neck to play bass notes . That left his fingers in a likely position to do all this chordal @-@ type stuff . Playing with his fingers so flat also got him that double @-@ string effect every time , like in ' Castles Made of Sand ' or ' Little Wing " . That 's an R & B thing . 
 A reference work by Hal Leonard compares it to a pianist 's approach , with Hendrix 's " thumb fret [ ting ] the bass notes , functioning in almost the same manner as a keyboardist 's left hand , and the fingers of his fretting hand can be likened to a pianist 's right hand " . Leonard also adds that guitarist Adrian Belew describes the technique as a " lost art " . 
 = = Lyrics and interpretation = = 
 In discussing his lyrics , Jimi Hendrix was characteristically enigmatic . In a 1967 interview , he explained " Most ballads come across in different ways . Sometimes you see things in different ways than other people see it . So then you write it in a song . It could represent anything " . In different interviews , he acknowledged an American Indian @-@ influence on his songs " I Don 't Live Today " , " May This Be Love " , and " Little Wing " . He described " Little Wing " as being " based on a very , very simple Indian style " , perhaps referring to some mythologies of the indigenous peoples of North America in which spirits inhabit nature and animals , including birds . In one interview , he saw it as self @-@ explanatory : " That 's exactly what it 's about , like ' She 's walking through the clouds ' " , 
 With a circus mind that 's running wild 
 Butterflies and zebras , and <unk> and fairy tales 
 That 's all she ever thinks about , riding with the wind 
 Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray likens the figure to a feminine ideal : " Sometimes she is a spirit , sometimes a fantasy , sometimes a woman as solidly , palpably physical as he is " . The figure first appears as " Waterfall " in " May This Be Love " , where she offers solace and hope , and as " a soulful , loving sprite " in " Little Wing " . However , other writers have suggested that the figure is similar to the guardian angel associated with Christianity , which is clearly what she represents in Hendrix 's later song " Angel " . Hendrix 's brother , Leon , interpreted " Little Wing " ( and " Angel " ) as a general tribute : " He wrote it for his girlfriends , our <unk> , and especially for our mama , who looked over us from high above in the afterlife " . Hendrix 's hand @-@ written lyrics for " Angel " ( with the note , " Finished January 14 , 1968 " ) use the title " My Angel Catherina ( Return of Little Wing ) " , which suggests that he saw a connection between the two songs . At the time , Hendrix had just finished a short tour of Scandinavia , where he had performed " Little Wing " in concert for the first time . At some point he responded to a question , " Love ? I know a girl , Katerina , in Sweden . " In a later 1969 interview , Hendrix described his relationships while he was on tour : " So like ' Little Wing ' is like one of these beautiful girls that come around sometimes ... She was a very sweet girl that came around that gave me her whole life and more if I wanted it . And me with my crazy ass couldn 't get it together , so I 'm off here and there and off over there . "

 " Little Wing " , along with the rest of the tracks for Axis : Bold as Love , was mixed October 31 , 1967 . Because some of the masters had been lost , stereo remixes were prepared on November 1 ( it is not clear if " Little Wing " was among those remixed ) . On November 2 , 1967 , a monaural mix was prepared , making Axis the last Hendrix album specifically mixed in mono ( subsequent mono albums were electronically " folded " from the stereo mixes ) . When recording engineer Kramer was preparing the album for a new mono reissue , he commented on the differences : " Perhaps the most unique track was ' Little Wing ' . Jimi 's guitar and vocals were much drier while the drum reverb was much more present . It was experimentation ... the entire [ mono ] album was all mixed in one day ! " 
 The album was issued by Track Records in the UK on December 1 , 1967 , and Reprise Records on January 15 , 1968 , in the US . The song appears on subsequent reissues of Axis : Bold as Love , which continues to be a best selling Hendrix album . It has also been included on numerous Hendrix compilation albums , including The Essential Jimi Hendrix , Stone Free , The Ultimate Experience , Experience Hendrix : The Best of Jimi Hendrix , and Voodoo Child : The Jimi Hendrix Collection . 
 = = Live performances = = 
 " Little Wing " was one of only two songs from Axis that the Experience regularly performed in concert , the other being " Spanish Castle Magic " . Except for the glockenspiel and the song 's ending , their live performances generally follow the studio arrangement . Since the Axis recording ends on a fade , Hendrix needed to devise a different live ending . Early recordings show a progression to an open chord , while later ones have more elaborate single @-@ string guitar improvisation with effects , such as wah @-@ wah , before a chiming final chord . For one 1968 performance in San Francisco , Hendrix 's guitar signal was routed through a Leslie speaker . Writer Dave Rubin commented , " the real Leslie played outdoors [ out of the studio ] like this really gives a very delicate , gentle swirl to the chords and helps the chordal embellishments in the intro " . This version was also rendered at a slower ( 56 bpm ) tempo , making it somewhat longer ( 4 : 01 ) . 
 On January 8 , 1968 , the Experience debuted the song at the <unk> in Stockholm , Sweden , recordings of which have appeared on bootleg albums . Other live versions appear on Stages : Paris 68 ( L 'Olympia Paris , January 29 , 1968 ) , The Jimi Hendrix Concerts ( Winterland Ballroom San Francisco , October 12 , 1968 ) , and Hendrix in the West ( Royal Albert Hall London , February 24 , 1969 ) . These recordings have been reissued on Live in Paris & Ottawa 1968 , Winterland , and The Jimi Hendrix Experience box set . The 1969 Royal Albert Hall live recording was included on singles issued in the UK and US in 1972 . A March 17 , 1968 , instrumental jam with Hendrix and members of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and the Electric Flag is built around " Little Wing " . Hendrix recorded it for his personal use around the time he began recording tracks for Electric Ladyland at the Record Plant studio in New York . This low fidelity tape from the Cafe au Go Go , along with others from the Generation Club and the Scene in New York , was later stolen from his apartment and has appeared on several bootleg albums over the years .

 In 2004 , Rolling Stone magazine included " Little Wing " on its list of the " 500 Greatest Songs of All Time " at number 366 . As one of Jimi Hendrix 's most popular and interpreted songs , " Little Wing " has gone on to become a standard . Some artists who have recorded it include : 
 = Battle of Evesham = 
 The Battle of Evesham ( 4 August 1265 ) was one of the two main battles of 13th century England 's Second Barons ' War . It marked the defeat of Simon de Montfort , Earl of Leicester , and the rebellious barons by Prince Edward – later King Edward I – who led the forces of his father , King Henry III . It took place on 4 August 1265 , near the town of Evesham , Worcestershire . 
 With the Battle of Lewes Montfort had won control of royal government , but after the defection of several close allies and the escape from captivity of Prince Edward , he found himself on the defensive . Forced to engage the royalists at Evesham , he faced an army twice the size of his own . The battle soon turned into a massacre ; Montfort himself was killed and his body mutilated . Though the battle effectively restored royal authority , scattered resistance remained until the Dictum of Kenilworth was signed in 1267 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Simon de Montfort , 6th Earl of Leicester , had gained a dominant position in the government of the Kingdom of England after his victory at the Battle of Lewes a year earlier . He also held the King , Prince Edward , and the King 's brother Richard of Cornwall in his custody . However , his sphere of influence rapidly began to deteriorate due to loss of key allies . In February , Robert de Ferrers , Earl of Derby was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower . An even more important collaborator , Gilbert de Clare , the Earl of Gloucester , deserted to the side of the King in May of the same year . With Gloucester 's assistance , Prince Edward escaped from Montfort 's captivity . 
 With the Lords of the Welsh Marches now in rebellion , Montfort solicited the aid of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , the Prince of Wales . Llywelyn agreed to help , in return for full recognition of his title , and the promise that he could keep all military gains . Whatever benefits this alliance might have brought Montfort , the great concessions cost him popularity at home . Meanwhile , Edward laid siege to the town of Gloucester , which fell on 29 June . Montfort 's goal now became to unite with the forces of his son Simon , and engage with the royal army , but the younger Simon moved much too slowly westwards from London . Eventually Simon made it to the baronial stronghold of Kenilworth , but Edward managed to inflict great losses on the enemy , many of whom were quartered outside the castle walls . From there the Prince moved south , where on 4 August , using many banners captured at Kenilworth to deceive Monfort into thinking his reinforcements were arriving , he managed to trap the older Montfort in a loop of the Avon , blocking off the only bridge and thereby forcing Montfort to fight without his son 's reinforcements . When Montfort realized this , he allegedly commented : " May the Lord have mercy upon our souls , as our bodies are theirs . " 
 = = Battle = = 
 Heeding a lesson learned at the Battle of Lewes , the royals took position on the high ground . Along a ridge called Green Hill , just north of Evesham , Edward set up his forces on the left , with Gloucester commanding the right . At about eight in the morning , Montfort left the town of Evesham as a great thunderstorm began to rage . At Lewes , the baronial forces had gained confidence to win the day by a sense of divine destiny , reinforced by white crosses on their uniforms . This time the royal army had taken their lead , and wore a red cross as their distinguishing mark . According to the chronicler William <unk> , when Montfort saw the advance of the royal troops , he exclaimed that " They have not learned that for themselves , but were taught it by me . " 
 The respective forces of the royal and baronial armies have been estimated to be 10 @,@ 000 and 5 @,@ 000 strong . Montfort , facing such unfavourable numbers , decided to concentrate his forces on the centre of the enemy ’ s front , hoping to drive a wedge through the line . Though the tactics were initially successful , the baronial forces soon lost the initiative , especially as the Welsh infantry provided by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had proved unreliable , and deserted at an early point . The flanks of the royal army closed in on Montfort 's , surrounding them . With Montfort confronted by a force twice the size of his own , on unfavourable ground , the battle rapidly turned into a massacre . 
 With their defeat at Lewes still fresh in memory , the royalists fought with a strong sense of bitterness and resentment . As a result , and despite attempts to surrender , most of the baronial rebels were killed on the battlefield rather than taken prisoner and ransomed , as was the common custom and practice . In what has been referred to as " an episode of noble bloodletting unprecedented since the Conquest " , Montfort 's son Henry was killed first , then Simon himself lost his horse and died fighting . His body was mutilated ; his head , hands , feet and testicles cut off . King Henry himself , who had been in the custody of Montfort and dressed up in his colours , was barely rescued from the mêlée by Roger de Leybourne , a converted rebel . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The royals were eager to settle scores after Montfort ’ s defeat . At the Parliament at Winchester in September the same year , all those who had taken part in the rebellion were disinherited . Yet even though the uprising of the younger Simon Montfort in Lincolnshire was over by Christmas , scattered resistance remained . The main problem was the garrison encamped at the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle , and a siege started in the summer of 1266 seemed futile . By the end of October , the royals drew up the so @-@ called Dictum of Kenilworth , whereby rebels were allowed to buy back their land at prices dependent on their level of involvement in the rebellion . The defenders of the castle turned down the offer at first , but by the end of the year conditions had become intolerable , and in 1267 the Dictum was agreed upon . 
 As far as wide @-@ scale confrontations went , the Battle of Evesham and its aftermath marked the end of baronial opposition in the reign of Henry III . The kingdom now entered into a period of unity and progress that lasted until the early 1290s . 
 = Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment = 
 The Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment was a mounted infantry regiment from New Zealand raised , in August 1914 , for service during the First World War . It was assigned to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade , part of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force . 
 The regiment was established with twenty @-@ six officers , 523 other ranks and 600 horses . It was formed from three squadrons belonging to pre war Territorial Force regiments : the 3rd ( Auckland ) Mounted Rifles , the 4th ( Waikato ) Mounted Rifles and the 11th ( North Auckland ) Mounted Rifles . It included a small headquarters and , until 1916 , a Maxim machine @-@ gun section . During the war , the Maxim guns were withdrawn but the regiment 's fire @-@ power increased until each squadron had four Hotchkiss machine @-@ guns , one per troop , by the end of the war . 
 As mounted infantry , the regiment rode into battle on their horses but were expected to dismount and fight on foot . The regiment fought predominantly against the forces of the Ottoman Turkish Empire . Their first engagement was in the Gallipoli Campaign between May and December 1915 , during which they participated in the largest battle of that theatre at Chunuk Bair and the fighting for Hill 60 . Evacuated to Egypt , the regiment took part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign from 1916 to 1918 . Their early battles included Romani , Gaza and Beersheba . Later in the war , they were part of the force that occupied the Jordan Valley and took part in the raids on Amman and Es Salt . Their final wartime operation was in connection with the capture of the Turkish Fourth Army . During the four years of war , the regiment sustained 334 dead from all causes and 555 wounded , several of those more than once . After the war , the regiment played a minor role in the Egyptian Revolution of 1919 before it was disbanded in June 1919 .

 = = = Formation = = = 
 The Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment was raised in August 1914 , at the start of the First World War , from the region around Auckland on the North Island of New Zealand . The regiment was commanded by Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Charles Ernest Randolph Mackesy , and comprised a headquarters , a machine @-@ gun section and three squadrons formed from Territorial Force regiments . The New Zealand Territorial Force included a compulsory training system and New Zealand 's four military districts were required to supply a mounted regiment for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force . To meet that obligation , each of the Territorial Force regiments provided a squadron , which kept its own regimental badges and traditions . The squadrons for the Auckland Mounted Rifles came from the 3rd ( Auckland ) Mounted Rifles , the 4th ( Waikato ) Mounted Rifles and the 11th ( North Auckland ) Mounted Rifles . 
 Upon its establishment , the regiment comprised twenty @-@ six officers and 523 other ranks , who were mounted on 528 riding horses , seventy @-@ four draught horses and six pack horses . Each squadron of 158 men had a field headquarters and four troops . Although the regiment used horses , they were not cavalry but mounted infantry , and were expected to ride to the battlefield , dismount and fight as traditional infantry . The regiment was assigned to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade , serving alongside two other mounted infantry regiments — the Wellington Mounted Rifles and the Canterbury Mounted Rifles . 
 = = = Embarkation = = = 
 What remained of August and most of September was taken up with training , until the regiment received embarkation orders and set sail from Auckland on 23 September . The unescorted transport ships returned to the same harbour the next morning , believing two German cruisers , were in the area . The troops disembarked and it was not until 11 October that they sailed again . This time they reached Wellington on 14 October . Two days later , now part of a large convoy of transport ships , four warships and 9 @,@ 000 men , they sailed again for an " unknown destination " . Stopping at Hobart , the New Zealand convoy waited until 1 November to be joined by an Australian contingent , then thirty @-@ eight ships set sail , heading north . With only brief halts to re @-@ coal at Colombo on 15 November and Aden on 24 November , the convoy entered the Suez Canal on 1 December . Four days later , the regiment disembarked at Alexandria . They entrained for Cairo and established their camp on the edge of the desert , in the suburb of Zeitoun . In the following months , the regiment practised their horsemanship , conducted small arms and bayonet training , and learned to construct trenches . 
 = = Gallipoli = = 
 In May 1915 , the regiment , with the rest of the brigade , was warned to prepare to embark for the Gallipoli Campaign , serving in a dismounted role as part of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC ) . A rear party remained behind to look after the horses while twenty @-@ six officers and 482 other ranks boarded the transport ships . On 12 May they landed at ANZAC Cove and the next day took over from the Royal Naval Brigade in the front line . The regiment was responsible for the section of the front known as " Walker 's Top " and " The Nek " , opposite what was possibly the strongest Turkish position , only fifty yards ( 46 m ) away . 
 They defeated their first Turkish attack on 18 / 19 May , when their position was subjected to small arms fire from midnight until 03 : 00 . Then the Turkish troops assaulted " Walker 's Top " and " Quinn 's Post " . The attack lasted an hour , and cost the regiment twenty @-@ two dead and twenty @-@ seven wounded , but they held the position . On 22 May they were relieved by the 9th Light Horse Regiment , and moved to the rear . In June the regiment repeatedly moved between front and rear area positions , and was not involved in a major battle . With Mackesy ill , Major Frank Chapman arrived from Egypt on 25 May to assume command of the regiment . He was followed five days later by one officer and 107 other ranks as reinforcements . He was followed , five days later , by one officer and 107 other ranks of reinforcements . The situation remained the same in July , and another two officers and ten men arrived to replace casualties . 
 August saw the regiment involved in the largest engagement of the campaign , at Chunuk Bair . After successfully capturing a Turkish position at " Old No.3 Post " on 6 August , they fought off several counter @-@ attacks , until 9 August , with a strength of only sixty @-@ six men from the 310 who started the battle , they were withdrawn to a rear area . Their casualties were fifty @-@ seven dead , 144 wounded and twenty @-@ seven missing in action . On 23 August those survivors with the Wellington Mounted Rifles returned to the front line and four days later took part in the fighting around Hill 60 . Their assault began at 17 : 00 and the regiment , with the Canterbury Mounted Rifles , captured the Turkish front line . The Wellington Mounted Rifles and Otago Mounted Rifles , following up , passed beyond the regiment to capture the Turkish reserve line . All four regiments suffered heavy casualties and had to fight off several counter @-@ attacks . On 29 August the regiment was relieved and moved to a safer area ; their casualties during the battle amounted to thirty @-@ eight dead , and sixty @-@ five wounded . 
 Early in September the regiment , now five officers and eighty @-@ three men , were moved back into the front line at " Cheshire Ridge " . They were relieved on 12 September and left Gallipoli the next day for the rest camp on the island of Lemnos , where they were joined by three officers and 216 other ranks as reinforcements on 5 October . Three days later , James Neil McCarroll assumed command of the regiment on temporary promotion to lieutenant @-@ colonel , while Mackesy was temporarily commander of the brigade . On 10 November the regiment , now ten officers and 286 other ranks , returned to Gallipoli , to prepare defences at " Waterfall Gully " . Three days later , another sixty @-@ six reinforcements arrived and moved into the front line at " Gloucester Hill " . On 14 December the regiment left for Lemnos again . They remained on the island until 22 December , when they sailed for Egypt . Disembarking four days later , they returned to their previous camp at Zeitoun . Mackesy returned to command the regiment on 27 December . 
 = = Sinai = = 
 The regiment spent its first month back in Egypt training . Then , once more back up to full establishment , it moved forward to defend the Suez Canal in the area of the Great Bitter Lake . At the same time , it also lost some of its veterans , including those who were wounded and convalescing in England , when several men were transferred to the infantry and artillery on the Western Front . 
 In March the regiment , still part of the brigade , was assigned to the newly formed ANZAC Mounted Division . Then on 23 April the regiment was ordered to move into the Sinai Desert to counter a Turkish attack against the British yeomanry at Katia . The following week the whole brigade relieved the 2nd Light Horse Brigade at Romani . The defeated Turkish troops had withdrawn east around twenty @-@ five miles ( 40 km ) to Salmana and the brigade was ordered to attack those positions . On 30 May the Auckland Mounted Rifles moved in advance of the brigade , circling around to get into a position to the south @-@ south @-@ east of Salmana . By 04 : 45 the regiment was ready and the attack started . They galloped towards the Turkish position on a mound , defended by around 200 – 300 men . Reaching the base of the mound , they dismounted and charged uphill with bayonets fixed . The defenders withdrew , pursued by the 3rd Squadron until Turkish reinforcements appeared and the squadron rejoined the regiment . Turkish casualties in the assault are unknown , but the regiment had only one man wounded . 
 The regiment now lost its Maxim machine @-@ gun section ; the guns were withdrawn to help form the brigade Machine @-@ Gun Squadron . They were replaced with three Lewis guns , one per squadron . The loss of the section reduced the regiment 's establishment to twenty @-@ four officers and 499 other ranks . 
 = = = Romani = = = 
 At the end of July , the 3rd Squadron was sent to patrol twenty miles ( 32 km ) to the south near the Nagid well , observing the left flank of a Turkish force crossing the Sinai . On 1 August patrols from the 11th Squadron were sent east of Dueidar , to the En Nuss and Nagid wells , as a defence force and to expand the wells to support a brigade . On 3 August the rest of the regiment moved to Dueidar . At that time , a Turkish force occupied Mount Royston at Romani . As a result , the regiment was ordered to rejoin the brigade , and by 11 : 30 they were observing around 2 @,@ 000 Turkish troops on Mount Royston . For the next thirty minutes the regiment was bombed by Turkish artillery , when a brigade attack was ordered . The 3rd Squadron , supported by Lewis guns from the machine @-@ gun sections , was positioned in the centre of the line between the Canterbury Mounted Rifles and a British yeomanry regiment . The advance forced the Turkish outposts to withdraw . By 16 : 45 , using the cover available , the regiment drew close enough to charge the Turkish defences , capturing 250 prisoners and a field hospital . All together the brigade took 1 @,@ 000 prisoners and a mountain artillery battery . The regiment 's casualties were two dead and six wounded . 
 Early the next day the NZMRB moved towards Katia , with the intention of attacking a Turkish gun emplacement . The brigade positioned itself between the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on the left and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the right . Taking the lead , the regiment advanced close enough by 14 : 30 to charge the position on horseback , then dismounted and continued the attack on foot , all in the face of heavy rifle and machine @-@ gun fire . No progress was made and they spent the rest of the day returning fire from cover . The engagement cost the regiment one dead and six wounded . 
 That night the regiment bivouacked at Katib Gannit and returned to the site of the battle the next day , 6 August , but the Turkish army had withdrawn eastwards . The brigade was ordered to advance until contact was regained with the Turkish force , which they located around 12 : 00 , to the east of Oghratina . The regiment remained in contact all day , without suffering any casualties . They also located a telephone wire that the withdrawing Turks had failed to disconnect , enabling them to monitor the German and Turkish command issuing orders . 
 = = = Abd = = = 
 The next day the brigade became the division reserve , so the regiment had a day of rest . On the following day , 8 August , they advanced again . By then , Oghratina was unoccupied . Later that day reconnaissance patrols located the Turkish force around two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of the well at Abd . 
 After halting overnight , the regiment led the NZMRB at 04 : 30 to attack the Turkish position . By 05 : 15 the regiment made contact with the Turkish outposts and advanced on foot towards the main Turkish defences , under covering fire from the Royal Horse Artillery ( RHA ) . The regiment had the 3rd Squadron on the left , and two troops of the 11th Squadron and a machine @-@ gun section on the right . Their right flank was supposed to be covered by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade , but it had failed to arrive . In consequence the regiment had to extend its lines to cover the open flank , so two troops from the 4th Squadron were sent there . Things were also not going well on the other flank . At 11 : 20 the Canterbury Mounted Rifles were forced to retire . Then , just before midday , two Turkish battalions of about 1 @,@ 100 men attacked the regiment . Still supported by the RHA , the brigade held its positions . For the next three and a half hours , the brigade was subjected to a heavy artillery bombardment . This was followed by another attack by three Turkish battalions . Holding out until 16 : 15 the regiment was then ordered to pull back . The day 's fighting cost the regiment twelve dead and twenty @-@ one wounded . 
 = = = Magdhaba = = = 
 The next three months were spent on reconnaissance patrols and manning observation posts until 20 December , when the advance east recommenced , with the regiment forming the vanguard for the ANZAC Mounted Division . Travelling overnight , they reached El Arish by dawn , which had been evacuated by the Turkish forces . 
 Magdhaba , with its 2 @,@ 000 @-@ man garrison , was twenty @-@ four miles ( 39 km ) to the south @-@ east , on the Wadi El Arish . At 10 : 30 on 22 December , the 3rd Squadron was sent along the wadi , in advance of the division , to determine whether the well at Lahfan could support the brigade . The brigade , leaving El Arish at midnight , followed the squadron . By daylight the division had surrounded Magdhaba . In the ensuing fighting , the village was captured after a bayonet charge in the late afternoon . The regiment , being held in reserve , took no part in the battle , but was afterwards left in charge of the village , clearing the dead and collecting war materials . It then returned to El Arish on Christmas Day . 
 = = Palestine = = 
 = = = Rafa = = = 
 On 8 January 1917 , the ANZAC Mounted Division headed out for their next objective , the police post at Rafa , thirty miles ( 48 km ) to the east on the Egyptian @-@ Palestinian border . Reaching Sheik Zowaiid at 22 : 00 , the regiment rested for three hours . At dawn the regiment surrounded the Bedouin village <unk> El Sufi , four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) south of Rafa . One of the inhabitants shot and killed one of the men . Another was knocked unconscious when hit on the head with a sword . Both of the Bedouins escaped on the troopers ' horses . 
 At 06 : 00 , the regiment crossed the border into Palestine . Moving out of the desert , the firmer ground made it easier for horse and wheeled transport . Forty @-@ five minutes later , the regiment was located behind a ridge line observing the Turkish defences , which consisted of trenches and redoubts , with a good field of fire to their front . At 09 : 00 the brigade was ordered to move around to attack the position from the right flank , while covering the area north to the Mediterranean Sea . At 09 : 30 the attack started . Galloping forward for about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) , the regiment was subjected to Turkish artillery fire . When they got within two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) from the Turkish lines , they dismounted and advanced on foot . The regiment advanced with the 3rd and 4th Squadrons leading and the 11th Squadron in reserve . On the right were the Canterbury Mounted Rifles , the 1st Light Horse Brigade was on the left and the Wellington Mounted Rifles were the brigade reserve . At midday , the complete brigade attacked the Green Knoll redoubt . The 3rd Squadron , unable to make any progress , held its position while the 11th Squadron moved around to the right of the 4th Squadron . By 15 : 00 the 3rd Squadron was able to move forward again and at 16 : 00 the regiment was preparing to charge the position . Then the division received word that Turkish reinforcements were approaching . That and the loss of daylight convinced Major @-@ General Harry Chauvel , commanding the division , to order a withdrawal . However , the order never reached the brigade , which had fixed bayonets and charged the remaining 200 to 300 yards ( 180 to 270 m ) to the Turkish trenches . They captured the first trench line , and the defenders started to surrender . Seeing what was happening , the remainder of the division returned to assist and the position was captured . The regiment 's casualties for the battle were seven dead and forty @-@ one wounded . 
 = = = Gaza = = = 
 At 02 : 30 on 26 March , the regiment set out from Dier El Belah towards Gaza . The division was to circle the town , cutting off any escape route east and provide a blocking force to stop Turkish reinforcements , while the 53rd ( Welsh ) Division and a brigade of the 54th ( East Anglian ) Division carried out a frontal assault . Positioned at the <unk> mound in the east with the 4th and 11th Squadrons , the regiment was assigned to watch for Turkish reinforcement coming from Huj . The main attack was not progressing well , so the brigade , along with the rest of the division , was ordered to attack Gaza . Still watching out for Turkish reinforcements , the regiment was held in reserve . The brigade had made good progress and was inside the town when it was ordered to withdraw . Less the 4th Squadron , which was the division 's rearguard , the regiment had returned to Dier El Belah by early the next day . 
 On 3 April the squadrons were issued Hotchkiss machine @-@ guns , on a scale of one per troop , which replaced the regiment 's three Lewis guns . The second British attempt to take Gaza would be on 17 April , but the day before the brigade moved to Hareira , providing flank protection and preventing Turkish reinforcement from that direction . The regiment reached Shellal at 03 : 00 , where they stopped to water their horses . At dawn hostile aircraft appeared overhead , which were engaged by the 11th Squadron , forcing them to fly at a higher altitude . By 09 : 00 the regiment was positioned overlooking Hareira , Sheria , and the Gaza @-@ Beersheba rail line . Several times during the day they were machine gunned by hostile aircraft , but no casualties were sustained . That night at 22 : 00 , as ordered , they returned to Shellal . 
 The next day the regiment returned to their previous task of flank protection . At midday the 3rd and 11th Squadrons were located along the ridge south @-@ east of El <unk> , forcing the Turkish observation posts to retire . The day was almost a replica of the previous one and the regiment was back at Shellal at 21 : 30 . Instead of resting overnight , they moved to El <unk> , arriving there at 06 : 00 on 19 April . The division was now required to be more aggressive , to draw the Turkish forces towards them , because of the lack of progress by the force attacking Gaza . The 3rd Squadron was detailed as a guard force for the division 's artillery , accompanying them to Atawineh . The squadron moved into the front line , losing one dead and seventeen wounded by the time it withdrew at 20 : 00 . The rest of the regiment was held in reserve , having two men wounded during an aircraft attack . By the end of the day , the second attempt to take Gaza was called off , the defences being to strong for a frontal assault . 
 Instead of withdrawing , the British remained in a forward line of trenches and redoubts . The regiment positioned itself around Karim Abu El <unk> , on the Wadi Ghuzze . McCarroll assumed command of the regiment again , Mackesy being appointed as the administrator of the Khan Yunus @-@ Deir and the Belah region . For the next few months patrol duty was interspersed with occupying the front line and training . 
 = = = Beersheba = = = 
 At 17 : 00 on 25 October the regiment , located around twenty miles ( 32 km ) from Beersheba , started to moved forward . Its first objective , fifteen miles ( 24 km ) south @-@ east at Esani , was reached at 01 : 00 on 26 October . Here they rested for two days before setting out again , travelling another fifteen miles ( 24 km ) to Asluj to the south of Beersheba . Waiting until the next night at 18 : 00 , they started north to attack Beersheba , the first ten miles ( 16 km ) along a metalled road . Then they followed the Wadi Imshash for the next ten miles ( 16 km ) , stopping at 02 : 00 while the Canterbury Mounted Rifles reconnoitred a suspected Turkish post . The night march started again an hour later . By daylight the brigade was positioned three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) to four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) south of the Beersheba @-@ Bir Arara Road , to the south @-@ east of the one thousand feet ( 300 m ) high Saba hill , with the regiment being the brigade reserve . 
 At 09 : 00 the regiment and the Somerset Battery RHA were ordered to attack Saba , to the east of Beersheba , positioned between the Canterbury Mounted Rifles on their right and the 3rd Light Horse Regiment on their left . The 11th Squadron , leading , advanced up a wadi under machine @-@ gun fire , but there was plenty of cover for the men and horses . The squadron dismounted one hundred yards ( 91 m ) from the Turkish front line and continued on foot . The 3rd and 4th Squadrons meanwhile had rode to within eight hundred yards ( 730 m ) to the north , then dismounted to continue on foot . Advancing by troops , covered by their machine @-@ guns , good progress was made . At 14 : 10 the regiment was ordered to assault the position . Thirty minutes later , a hill four hundred yards ( 370 m ) east of Saba was taken with sixty prisoners and three machine @-@ guns . A short while later , Saba itself was captured with 132 prisoners and four machine @-@ guns . However , the regiment had six dead and twenty @-@ two wounded , including a squadron leader . 
 The regiment remained , consolidating Saba until 2 November while the brigade 's other regiment and the 4th Squadron were fighting a Turkish cavalry force . On 4 November the brigade moved to Wadi El Sultan . The next day the 4th Squadron was tasked to support the Canterbury Mounted Rifles , advancing against a Turkish position eight hundred yards ( 730 m ) away . The Turks counter @-@ attacked the Canterbury Mounted Rifles , so the 3rd Squadron was moved forward to support them and the attack was defeated . The regiment lost one man dead and four wounded during the day 's fighting . While the rest of the brigade retired to the west , the regiment remained at the front manning observation posts until 11 November , when they were relieved by the British Westminster Dragoons . 
 = = = Ayun Kara = = = 
 The regiment left Beersheba to rejoin the brigade , then had to move sixty miles ( 97 km ) across the front to the British left flank . Travelling through the night , at 07 : 30 they had reached <unk> , where they rested for two hours . Continuing their advance , they reached <unk> at 13 : 30 , Bureir at 14 : 30 , then finally Hamama , where they established a rest camp . The march was difficult for men and horses , with virtually no food or water . The horses were taken to the sea to drink . Their supplies finally caught up with the regiment and that night they moved again to a new camp two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) north of Sukereir . The next day the regiment rejoined the brigade , outside the village of Ayun Kara . 
 At 11 : 00 on 14 November the Canterbury Mounted Rifles , the brigade vanguard , encountered Turkish observation posts . The brigade ordered an attack on the main Turkish defences . The regiment was positioned to cover the left flank . Advancing by troops they came under machine @-@ gun fire . The 3rd Squadron was dispatched to occupy the high ground on the regiment 's right while the other squadrons took cover . Then a force of Turkish cavalry appeared to their left . McCarroll sent the 11th Squadron to check on their dispositions and numbers . However , the squadron encountered heavy rifle and machine @-@ gun fire and could not move forward . To assist them , two troops from the 4th Squadron , were ordered to charge on horseback . The two troops captured the position and continued forward , occupying the high ground on the left in front of the Wellington Mounted Rifles . The 3rd Squadron , in reserve , provided covering fire as the 11th Squadron moved forward alongside the 4th on their left . Covered by the 4th Squadron , the 11th Squadron moved forward . At 14 : 15 the advance troops of the 11th Squadron located , in an orange grove , a Turkish concentration of troops that counter @-@ attacked the regiment . McCarroll , who had kept up with his forward line of troops , ordered the rest of the regiment , including headquarters troops , to move up in support of the 11th Squadron . The 3rd Squadron galloped forward , dismounting just behind the front line , and engaged the Turkish attack with enfilade fire , forcing the Turks to retire . 
 At 14 : 45 , covered by an artillery barrage and machine @-@ gun fire , the Turkish troops counter @-@ attacked again . The regiment 's machine gunners returned fire and for a short time the battle became a machine @-@ gun engagement . During this time the Wellington Mounted Rifles , to the right , had occupied a prominent hill , but were under heavy fire . To support them , the 3rd Squadron sent two troops to engage their opponents , which they caught in the bottom of a valley , with enfilade fire . Then in front of the regiment a fresh Turkish battalion was sent to assault them . In some places , the Turkish force got close enough to throw hand grenades into the regiment 's defences . These killed or wounded all those defending a small hill , which was then occupied by the Turkish troops , bringing indirect fire onto the rest of the regiment 's positions , which by now were becoming untenable . At first , messengers sent to the 4th Squadron asking for assistance failed to get through . Eventually the squadron received the message and charged across the open ground , recapturing the hill . This brought the rest of the Turkish line into range of the squadron 's guns . Confronted by the new threat , the Turkish troops retired back to their starting point . McCarroll was ordering a regiment attack on the orange grove when he was wounded in the neck and shoulder , forcing Major Henry Whitehorn to assume temporary command of the regiment . By then it was getting dark and the only Turkish offensive action was an artillery bombardment . Instead of attacking , the regiment spent the rest of the day evacuating the wounded and strengthening their lines . Their casualties during the battle were fifteen dead and seventy @-@ four wounded . The next morning it was discovered that Ayun Kara had been evacuated by the Turkish troops . 
 = = = River Auja = = = 
 On 15 November the brigade moved forward again to Rishon LeZion village five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) south of the port of Jaffa . The next day the regiment moved forward alone and established a line of observation posts between Beit Dejan and <unk> , just under four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) from Jaffa . Reconnaissance patrols discovered that Jaffa was not occupied by any Turkish forces , so the 3rd Squadron and the Canterbury Mounted Rifles moved in to provide a garrison , while the rest of the regiment and the Wellington Mounted Rifles returned to Ayun Kara . The regiment moved further north on 18 November and over the next few days carried out a reconnaissance of the River Auja . 
 On 27 November the brigade secured a bridgehead over the river . To help defend the crossing , the 3rd and 11th Squadrons dug in on the northern bank . The next day , at 14 : 45 , the squadrons were attacked and by 17 : 45 , first the horse holders and the regiment 's mounts were sent back across the river . The squadrons were forced to retire to the lines of the supporting infantry . By 20 : 00 the entire British position was under threat and had to withdraw back across to the south of the river . The regiment 's casualties were one dead , one missing and nineteen wounded , including Whitehorn . Command of the regiment temporarily passed to Major Duncan Munro . 
 After the battle at the River Auja , the brigade camped to the south @-@ east of Sarona , out of range of the Turkish artillery . The regiment , having only sixteen officers and 375 other ranks left effective , spent the time building up it strength in men and horses . In the last month the regiment had lost twenty @-@ seven dead and eighty @-@ eight wounded , sixty @-@ one had to be evacuated to the rear as they were ill and two men were missing . 
 Whitehorn returned on 16 December to resume temporary command of the regiment . Two days later the regiment returned to Jaffa and came under command of the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division . Then on 20 December the Lowland Division assaulted the River Auja and the regiment patrolled north of the river , supporting the division until 25 December , when they rejoined the NZMRB . 
 = = Jordan valley = = 
 = = = Jericho = = = 
 McCarroll , recovered from his wounds , resumed command of the regiment on 15 January 1918 . It was still understrength , with only twenty @-@ two officers and 486 other ranks . 
 In February the ANZAC Mounted Division was ordered to cross over to the British right flank , to conduct operations in the Jordan Valley by first capturing Jericho . By 19 February the regiment was east of Bethlehem and at 09 : 30 started toward Jericho along what was described as " little more than a goat track " . At times the track was so steep that the men had to dismount and lead their horses by hand . After stopping overnight , the regiment set out again as the vanguard at 04 : 30 , moving in single file . Soon afterwards , Turkish guns opened fire on them from two hills , <unk> and <unk> , which could dominate their approach . Upon reaching the valley bottom , the regiment spread out to provide a more difficult target . Moving forward under Turkish artillery and machine @-@ gun fire , the regiment galloped from cover to cover by troops . This continued until around midday when the 11th Squadron got close enough to assault a Turkish position on the right of the valley . At the same time , the 3rd and 4th Squadrons were advancing in the centre and to the left . Elsewhere the Australian light horse brigades and British infantry were having similar problems . Eventually the British secured a position that allowed then to bring fire onto the Turkish defences in front of the regiment , forcing them to retire further up the <unk> hill . The regiment 's horse holders brought the mounts forward and the regiment charged the position on horseback . The Turkish forces retired , but kept the hill now occupied by the regiment under an artillery barrage . 
 The next day there was no trace of any Turkish forces and the advance continued . At times , this was again only possible by moving in single file , leaving the brigade spread along five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) of tracks . At 09 : 00 the regiment moved out of the hills and into the Jordan Valley , just north of the Dead Sea and south of Jericho , about eight miles ( 13 km ) from the River Jordan . The time it had taken the NZMRB to negotiate the track allowed the Turkish forces to retire to the east bank of the river by a pontoon bridge at <unk> . While the Australians captured Jericho , the regiment established a camp in the valley under the Mount of Temptation , north of Jericho . The brigade was then made responsible for guarding the river from the Dead Sea to the Ghoraniyeh bridge . However , on 22 February the rest of the NZMRB returned to Ayun Kara , leaving the regiment in the valley under command of the 60th ( London ) Division , tasked to carry out mounted patrols of the river . 
 = = = Amman raid = = = 
 The regiment was next involved in a raid on the village of Amman to the east of the River Jordan . The force assembled for the operation comprised the ANZAC Mounted Division , the 60th ( London ) Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade . Reconnaissance patrols had discovered that the river was not fordable and they would have to construct bridges to get across . Three viable sites had been selected at Makhadet ( which means ford ) , Hajlah three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) north of the Dead Sea , and Ghoraniyeh . Two crossings were to be constructed . At <unk> , pontoon bridge made from steel would be assembled for the mounted troops . The second crossing point , at Ghoraniyeh where there was already a damaged pontoon bridge , would have three bridges for the 60th Division : a normal pontoon bridge , a barrel bridge , and an infantry bridge . 
 At midnight on 21 March , the infantry tried to cross at Ghoraniyeh , however the river was flowing too fast for their swimmers to get across . At Hajlah they had more success and a raft was constructed to ferry men and materials across . By dawn the Turkish had discovered them crossing and were engaging the crossing infantry with machine @-@ gun fire . Engineers had finished the pontoon bridge by 08 : 10 and more troops were crossing , but their exploitation was restricted to around five hundred yards ( 460 m ) from the river line as they were confronted by strong Turkish defences . 
 At 05 : 00 on 23 March the regiment , the first mounted force , began to cross the river . They were passing beyond the infantry forward troops by 07 : 30 . Two troops from the 11th Squadron were dispatched to the east and another north @-@ east . One troop , twenty men , encountered a force of sixty Turkish cavalry and charged them , armed only with rifles and bayonets . The troop killed twenty cavalrymen and captured seven , in exchange for the death of one man , the troop leader who had ordered the charge . The troop sent north had forced a machine @-@ gun post covering the river to withdraw , but the gun and its crew were later captured by men from the 4th Squadron . While this move had been progressing , the troop of the 11th Squadron had been sent north from the crossing . At the same time the 3rd and 4th Squadrons galloped north to take the Turkish defenders at Ghoraniyeh from the rear . At 09 : 00 the leading troops , without loss , captured the first Turkish outpost with seventeen prisoners . One troop of the 3rd Squadron dismounted and captured two machine @-@ gun posts overlooking the crossing , which allowed the rest of the squadron to drive off the remaining defenders . While the 3rd Squadron concentrated on the crossing the 4th Squadron was ordered to gallop and capture the village of Shunet Nimrin , but were unable to approach the village when confronted by heavy artillery fire . The day 's battle cost the regiment one dead and two wounded . By that night the bridge at Ghoraniyeh was completed and the remainder of the ANZAC Mounted Division were crossing at Hajlah . 
 The next morning , when the NZMRB had crossed the river , McCarroll was given command of the vanguard , comprising the regiment , a squadron from the Canterbury Mounted Rifles and the Hong Kong and Singapore Mountain Artillery Battery . Progress was slow along the steep tracks and they had to camp in the hills that night at an altitude between 2 @,@ 000 to 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 to 910 m ) . During the night it started to rain , making travelling along the small tracks even harder at daylight . Because the rest of the division was having even worse problems than the brigade , they stopped at the village of Ain es Sir . During the day , they captured seven Germans and eighty @-@ eight Turkish troops . Another problem for the regiment was the lack of supplies ; their rations were stuck somewhere behind them on the track . The remainder of the division arrived during the day and the raid on Amman was planned for the next day , 27 March . 
 At 08 : 00 the NZMRB set out heading south @-@ east , the plan called for them to assault Amman from the south . The vanguard was provided by the regiment with the 4th Squadron leading . When they got within three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) of the village , they came under a Turkish artillery barrage . At 12 : 00 when the regiment was 1 @,@ 500 yards ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) from the rail line , which would be their right flank position , they turned north . Then a Turkish train arrived along the tracks from the south . The regiment 's machine @-@ gunners opened fire of it , and they were just about to charge when it continued on into Amman . By now Turkish artillery and machine @-@ gun fire was proving effective and the regiment was unable to make any progress . Hill 3039 , in front of the 3rd Squadron , was well defended with numerous machine @-@ guns , so the 4th Squadron were sent forward to support the assault . While 11th Squadron moved right , to the higher ground , to give covering fire . At 18 : 00 Turkish troops mounted a counter @-@ attack against the Canterbury Mounted Rifles on the regiment 's left , but the regiment held the position . By nightfall no further progress was made and the division decided to hold onto what territory they had occupied and wait for assistance from 60th Division . The day 's fighting had cost the regiment eighteen casualties . They still had not received any supplies and the rations they carried were exhausted . 
 That night , 27 / 28 March , the Turkish forces in Amman were reinforced , which again prevented the regiment from advancing . When two infantry battalions and an artillery battery arrived at 11 : 30 plans were made for another assault at 13 : 00 . But still faced with heavy artillery and machine @-@ gun fire , by 16 : 00 the regiment had only managed to advance five hundred yards ( 460 m ) onto the lower slopes of Hill 3039 . The position there was untenable and the regiment was forced to withdraw to a better location that night . 
 The next day , 29 March , the division consolidated their positions , planning to resume the assault on 30 March . McCarroll was given command of the assault . Position " A " was their main objective . The approach route would be along a ridge line between " B " and " C , " which were to be neutralised by two troops in case the Turkish tried to intervene in the attack . Once " A " was captured , it was believed " B " and " C " would surrender . 
 The regiment and a battalion from the Imperial Camel Corps would attack point " A " . The Canterbury Mounted Rifles would support the attack on the regiment 's left . At 01 : 45 the regiment moved forward , dismounted and managed to get close enough to the first objective to charge home without being seen , capturing the first trench , five machine @-@ guns and twenty @-@ three prisoners . The regiment continued on , capturing the position . At daybreak Turkish troops were able to bring enfilade fire from point " B " against the regiment 's positions . So 4th Squadron , with 3rd Squadron providing covering fire , mounted an attack and captured that position . At 09 : 30 Turkish troops were seen gathered on the north @-@ east side of the hill . McCarroll asked for artillery support to break up their troops , but there was none available . The mountain battery , at the time , only had four rounds left . The Turkish forces attacked and managed to close on the regiment 's defences before they were stopped by rifle and machine @-@ gun fire . 
 With no further progress being made anywhere , and the arrival of more Turkish reinforcements , a withdrawal back across the River Jordan was ordered that night . Plans were made for the wounded to leave first , then the fighting troops falling back in turn . McCarroll gave each unit exact times they were to retire , so they still presented a continuous line as they moved back . They withdrew without attracting the attention of the Turkish troops and at 04 : 00 the regiment arrived back at Ain es Sir . The brigade was designated as the force rearguard . At 16 : 00 a large Turkish force was reported by the Canterbury Mounted Rifles to be approaching from the north , so the regiment was sent to help . The Turkish force had come to within 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) of the New Zealand lines , but did not attack . The next day , 1 April , the withdrawal continued and several times Turkish troops were sighted following . They eventually reached Nimrin in the Jordan Valley at 20 : 00 that night . The regiment 's exact casualties are not documented , but the NZMRB lost thirty @-@ eight dead , 122 wounded and had thirteen men reported missing during the raid .

 The regiment spent most of April on patrol and guard duties to the west of the River Jordan . The Rugby football team were presented , by Lieutenant @-@ General Harry Chauvel , commanding the Desert Mounted Corps , with the division 's cup for being the champion team . The second raid across the Jordan on Es Salt began on 29 April , with the brigade initially being held in reserve . The operation had similar problems as the first raid , and on 30 April the brigade was moved forward . The Wellington Mounted Rifles and Canterbury Mounted Rifles were ordered to support the assault by the infantry at Nimrin , while the regiment remained in reserve . At 09 : 30 the 4th Squadron was sent forward to support the Canterbury Mounted Rifles , but a Turkish artillery barrage , by at least four batteries , landed to their front , preventing them going forward . The artillery fire increased and the rest of the regiment had to retire to put the horses out of harm 's way . Without making further progress that day , the regiment returned to the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead for the night . More Turkish reinforcements arrived overnight and opposition to any British advance was increasing . Eventually the regiment was ordered to gallop forward to the front line , deploying to cover two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) along the track from Es Salt . One of the first things they observed was a party of RHA artillerymen going back without their guns , which they had been forced to abandon . The 3rd and 4th Squadrons began digging trenches , as the regiment had to hold a position covering the only way back for the 4th Light Horse Brigade , to their front . On 2 May the Australians were ordered to withdraw , reaching the regiment 's position the next day . That night the regiment withdrew to a ford at Auja , where engineers were constructing a pontoon bridge . The regiment remained there alone the next day while the rest of the NZMRB returned to their previous camp near Jericho . The regiment was relieved the next day and rejoined the brigade . 
 = = = Summer 1918 = = = 
 The regiment remained in the western foothills of the Jordan Valley , based at Talat Ed Dumm , until the end of May , then moved to El Khudr , beside Bethlehem , where some men were granted leave in Port Said , and Jerusalem . In June the regiment returned to the valley , based at the Wadi Abeid , carrying out patrols and enhancing defences . At the start of July , they moved again , this time to Ain Ed Duk , relieving the Wellington Mounted Rifles . On 18 July the 1st Light Horse Brigade , to the regiment 's left , was attacked by a large force of Germans . Turkish troops supporting that attack also attempted to break the regiment 's line , but they were fought off . Relieved a few days later , the regiment returned to Bethlehem . Casualties during the month were all down to malaria , or other diseases , 170 men being evacuated to hospital . In August they returned to duties in the valley at Jericho , and another 109 men were evacuated to hospital during the month . 
 = = Chaytor 's Force = = 
 In September , Chaytor , commanding the ANZAC Mounted Division , was given command of a mixed mounted and infantry force to carry out a deception plan in the Jordan Valley . The regiment helped by constructing dummy camps with dummy horse lines and increased their patrolling , with the objective of discovering the Turkish strength and positions . The rest of the army was aligned to their left flank and on 19 September started the last attack major attack of the campaign . With the Turkish forces retiring to counter the attack in the west , by 21 September the NZMRB was ordered forward , reinforced by two battalions of the British West Indies Regiment , their own Ayrshire Battery RHA and the 29th Indian Mountain Battery . 
 = = = Damieh = = = 
 That night , 21 September , the regiment left its base at Musallabeh and headed north up the Jordan Valley . The 4th Squadron , leading , covered the first ten miles ( 16 km ) , reaching Kh Fusail and then Tel Es Ed <unk> , with no opposition . They encountered a Turkish defence line at the Mafid <unk> bridge , which was captured along with twenty prisoners and two machine @-@ guns . That night the infantry were left guarding the bridge , while the NZMRB continued advancing north to secure an important bridge at Damieh , cutting the Nablus road . 
 At midnight the regiment , supported by a section of the brigade machine @-@ gun squadron , set out again , leading the brigade along the Jericho @-@ Beisan road . The 3rd Squadron was sent ahead , after a force of Turkish troops believed to be withdrawing along the road in front of them , and to capture the Damieh bridge . The 11th Squadron remained on the road as a blocking force while the 4th Squadron headed to El Makhruk to the north @-@ east . The 11th Squadron captured a Turkish convoy that came along the road , while the 3rd Squadron caught up with the force in front of them , capturing several prisoners . They also discovered a Turkish cavalry picket line and forced them down from the hills onto the low ground along the river towards the Damieh bridge . The 3rd Squadron , holding the high ground , was counter @-@ attacked by infantry supported by artillery . Part of the squadron was forced to retire to a better defensive position . As reinforcements were observed arriving for the Turkish force , a regiment attack was ordered and reinforcements of their own requested . Support came from a squadron of the Canterbury Mounted Rifles and a West Indies infantry company . The regiment was around five hundred yards ( 460 m ) from the bridge , almost surrounding the Turkish position there . McCarroll planned the assault , with six troops and a machine @-@ gun on the left to provide fire support . Then from left to right , less one troop in reserve , the rest of the regiment positioned itself from left to right , followed by the West Indies company , then the Canterbury Mounted Rifles squadron on the right . The attack began , supported by machine @-@ gun and artillery fire . The Turkish line was pierced and they started to withdraw across the bridge pursued by the regiment . The bridge was secured intact , along with 350 prisoners and seven machine @-@ guns . The regiment had four dead and one wounded . One of the West Indies soldiers was also wounded . The regiment now settled in , defending the bridge while the Canterbury Mounted Rifles squadron crossed and started clearing the far bank . 
 = = = Es Salt again = = = 
 The next day the brigade crossed the bridge and at midday continued east towards Es Salt . By 17 : 00 the regiment was camped to the west of the town . They entered the unoccupied Es Salt on the following day , watered their horses , then continued east towards Amman as the vanguard . Passing abandoned wagons , dead men and animals , they had caught up with the Turkish rearguard by 12 : 00 , but had to stop at the village of Suweileh to water their horses and wait for the rest of the brigade to catch up with them . That night a selected group of 100 men , commanded by Major John Herrold , were sent out twelve miles ( 19 km ) across country to damage the Hedjaz rail line south of Amman . Each of the three squadrons provided an officer and thirty @-@ three men . Their only tools were two picks , two shovels , and four <unk> . The force was divided into three : one to tackle the rails and the other two to provide protection . When they found the rail line , they followed it for about two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) . Hearing sounds of digging , they dismounted , continuing on foot until they located a group of Turks digging trenches . Part of their objective was to remain undetected , so they withdrew , leaving the Turkish force alone . They eventually located the section of track they were looking for . However , the road alongside the tracks was full of Turkish traffic . Establishing a base four hundred yards ( 370 m ) from the track , the rail group now crept forward to attack the tracks . Their work was first interrupted when an armoured train with trucks full of soldiers came along the rails . They were next disturbed by a mounted patrol , which passed by without observing them . They eventually removed two rails , making the tracks unusable . The group then returned to their horses and returned to the regiment at dawn . That day the value of their efforts was seen when a train was wrecked where they had broken the rails . For his command of the operation Herrold was invested as a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order . 
 = = = Amman again = = = 
 On 25 September , the same day the railway group returned , the brigade set out at 06 : 00 for Amman . Approaching from the north , they would be supported during the assault by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade . At 10 : 30 the regiment , with a machine @-@ gun section and an artillery section , was ordered to move forward to the left of the Canterbury Mounted Rifles . The Turkish defenders were in redoubts surrounded by barbed wire . McCarroll sent a squadron to attack from the west , which came under Turkish machine @-@ gun fire . Covered by the artillery the squadron was gradually able to advance . At 15 : 30 the reserve squadron galloped forward , dismounted and came under machine @-@ gun fire . The regiment and Canterbury Mounted Rifles pushed forward . The 4th Squadron succeeded in reaching a double redoubt , but just as they were about to charge , sixty of the defenders surrendered and others withdrew along the Wadi Amman . By now the Canterbury Mounted Rifles had galloped into the town and out the other side , capturing the Turkish defences there from the rear . The battle was over and the brigade captured 1 @,@ 734 prisoners , twenty @-@ seven machine @-@ guns , five artillery pieces , 298 horses and other military supplies . That night the regiment camped in the Wadi Amman . 
 Several days later the NZMRB was moved to the south to support the 2nd Light Horse Brigade at Ziza . The light @-@ horsemen had taken the surrender of a large Turkish force , part of the Turkish Fourth Army , then had to defend them from the Arab tribesmen . When the brigade arrived the Australian and Turkish troops , who were still armed , were holding a perimeter facing the Arab force . The brigade 's appearance resolved the situation and the Turkish troops surrendered . 
 = = Post war = = 
 In October 1918 , the regiment 's part in the war now over ; they returned to the Jordan Valley . However many men were now struck down with malaria . In the next few days those who were able returned to Richon @-@ le @-@ Zion , where they established their camp . By November the regiment had eleven officers and 331 other ranks in hospital ; twenty @-@ two of those died of the disease . Only two men from the regiment had not been infected in any way . 
 The regiment remained at Richon until 18 December , carrying out military training and playing sports . Then they moved back to Rafa , where a school was established . It was discovered that before the war one of the regiment 's troopers had been a schools inspector , so he was immediately promoted to major , taking charge of lessons . 
 While waiting for repatriation to New Zealand the regiment played a minor role in the 1919 Egyptian Revolution , which was a Nationalist uprising in the Nile Delta region . The regiment were reissued its equipment and sent to support the authorities , as martial law had been declared . The uprising soon ended without any major incidents . One incident the regiment had to deal with was a request from an Egyptian woman for an officer to grant her a divorce . On 22 June the regiment moved to the Demobilisation Camp at Ismailia on the Suez Canal . They boarded the transport HMT Ulimaroa and sail for New Zealand . On 30 June the regiment ceased to exist as such . Five weeks later , on 8 August , the Ulimaroa arrived at Auckland . 
 = = = Casualties = = = 
 During its service , 334 men of the regiment died from all causes , either killed in action , died of wounds or disease , and two were lost at sea . Almost two thirds of those , 202 men , were killed during the seven months they fought in the Gallipoli Campaign , while 130 died during the two years of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign . There were also 555 men wounded ; 53 of those were unfortunate enough to have been wounded twice . The Gallipoli Campaign accounted for over half of the total number of wounded at 316 men ; 22 of them were wounded twice . Then in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign , there were another 239 men wounded , with 31 of those again wounded twice . 
 Many of the Gallipoli dead have no known grave . The Commonwealth War Graves Commission Chunuk Bair Cemetery , constructed on the site where the Turks buried Allied war dead after the evacuation , has 632 graves . Only ten of the men there have been identified . At the nearby Hill 60 Cemetery , which has another 788 graves , only seventy @-@ six of the dead were identified .

 Several men of the regiment were recognised for their service by the British Empire awards system . The two commanding officers , Mackesy and McCarroll , were invested as Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George , and as Companions of the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) . McCarroll also received a bar for the DSO to signify a second award . While Mackesy was also invested as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire . Two other men also received a DSO both majors , Herrold for the raid on the rail line at Amman and Ralph Wyman at Gallipoli . There were two civilian awards , of an Officer of the Order of the British Empire and a Member of the Order of the British Empire . The Military Cross was awarded to eight officers ; two men received bars for a second award . The other ranks were awarded six Distinguished Conduct Medals , and sixteen Military Medals . There were also twenty @-@ six men Mentioned in Dispatches for all ranks . 
 = Galatian War = 
 The Galatian War was a war between the Galatian Gauls and the Roman Republic supported by their allies Pergamum in 189 BC . The war was fought in Galatia in central Asia Minor , in present @-@ day Turkey . 
 The Romans had just defeated the Seleucids in the Roman @-@ Syrian War and had forced them to thereby sue for peace . Following their recently successful operation in Syria , the Romans then turned their attention towards the Gallic tribes of Galatia who had emigrated to Asia Minor almost 100 years prior to the ensuing military engagement . Gnaeus Manlius Vulso , the consul , excused the invasion by saying that it was in retaliation for the Galatians supplying troops to the Seleucids during the war . Vulso embarked on this campaign without the permission of the Roman Senate . Joined by Pergamum , the Romans marched inland and attacked the Galatians . They defeated the Galatians in a battle on Mount Olympus and followed up the victory by defeating a larger army near Ankara . 
 These defeats forced the Galatians to sue for peace and the Romans returned to the coast of Asia Minor . However , when Manlius Vulso returned to Rome , he was charged with threatening the peace between the Seleucids and Rome . He was cleared and was granted a triumph by the Senate . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 In 191 BC , Antiochus the Great , the Emperor of the Seleucid Empire of Asia invaded Greece . The Romans decided to intervene and they defeated the Seleucids at the Battle of Thermopylae . The defeat by Rome forced the Seleucids to retreat back to Asia Minor . The Romans followed them across the Aegean Sea and together with their allies , Pergamum , they decisively defeated the Seleucids at the Battle of Magnesia . 
 The Seleucids sued for peace and began settling it with Scipio Asiaticus . In spring , the new consul , Gnaeus Manlius Vulso arrived to take control of the army from Scipio Asiaticus . He was sent to conclude the treaty that Scipio was arranging . However , he was not content with the task given to him and he started to plan a new war . He addressed the soldiers and congratulated them on their victory and then proposed a new war , against the Galatian Gauls of Asia Minor . The pretext he used for the invasion was that the Galatians had supplied soldiers to the Seleucid army at the Battle of Magnesia . The principal reason for the invasion was Manlius ' desire to seize the wealth of the Galatians who had become rich from plundering their neighbours and to gain glory for himself . 
 This war was the first occasion that a Roman general had started a war without the permission of the senate or the people . This was a dangerous precedent and this became an example for the future . 
 Manlius started his war preparation by summoning the Pergamese to help . However , the King of Pergamum , Eumenes II was in Rome so his brother , Attalus who was the regent took command of the Pergamese army . He joined the Roman army a few days later with 1 @,@ 000 infantry and 500 cavalry . 
 = = March inland = = 
 The combined Roman @-@ Pergamese army started their march from Ephesus . They advanced inland passing Magnesia on the Maeander and into the territory of <unk> where they were met by 1 @,@ 000 infantry and 300 cavalry led by Attalus ' brother . They then marched to Antiochia where they were met by Antiochus ' son , Seleucus who offered corn as part of the treaty that was being concluded . 
 As they marched inland through the upper Maeander valley and Pamphylia gathering levies from local princes and tyrants without much opposition . However , they advanced into the territory of <unk> , ruled by the tyrant <unk> , known for his cruelty . When the Roman envoys reached the city , the tyrant begged them not to ravage the territory because he was a Roman ally and promised to give them fifteen talents . The envoys asked <unk> to send envoys to Vulso 's camp . Vulso met them as they approached the camp and addressed them as Polybius writes : 
 " Not only had <unk> shown himself the most determined enemy of Rome , of all the princes in Asia , but had done his very best to overthrow their empire , and deserved punishment rather than friendship . " 
 The envoys were terrified by his angry response and asked the consul to meet the tyrant for an interview to which Vulso agreed . The next day the tyrant emerged from the city and pleaded with Vulso to accept the fifteen talents . Vulso replied : 
 " If he did not pay five hundred talents , and be thankful that he was allowed to do so , he would not loot the country , but he would storm and sack the city . " 
 The tyrant however , was able to persuade Vulso to reduce the price to 100 talents and promised to provide him with 1 @,@ 000 <unk> of wheat . Thus <unk> managed to save his city . When the consul crossed the River <unk> he was met by ambassadors from the town of Sinda in Pisidia . The ambassadors asked for assistance against the city of <unk> who had taken over all their country except for the capitol . 
 The consul agreed to the offer . He entered <unk> territory , allowing them to enter his alliance for fifty talents and for their withdrawal from Sindian territory . Vulso proceeded to seize the city of <unk> in Pisidia and with it a large booty . He then took the city of <unk> before accepting a tribute of fifty talents and 20 @,@ 000 <unk> of barley and wheat from the city of <unk> . 
 The consul reached the <unk> Springs and he was once again met by Seleucus . Seleucus took the injured and sick Romans with him to Apamea as well as supplying the Romans some guides . They marched for three days after departing from the springs and on the third day they arrived on the border with the <unk> , one of the three Galatian tribes . The consul held an assembly and addressed his troops about the upcoming war . He then sent envoys to Eposognatus , chieftain of the Tectosagi , the only chieftain who was friendly with Pergamum . The envoys returned and replied that the chieftain of the Tectosagi begged the Romans not to invade his territory . He also claimed that he would attempt to force the submission of the other chieftains . 
 The army marched deeper inland and pitched camp near a Galatian stronghold called <unk> . While they were there , the Galatian cavalry attacked the army 's advance guard and caused significant casualties before the Roman cavalry counter @-@ attacked and drove back the Galatians with heavy losses . The consul knowing that he was in reach of the enemy decided to move forward more cautiously . 
 = = Battle of Mount Olympus = = 
 The Romans and the Pergamese arrived at the city of <unk> and found it deserted . As they camped there they were met by a messenger sent by Eposognatus . The messenger reported that Eposognatus had failed in persuading the Galatians not to attack and that they were mustering nearby in the mountains . 
 The <unk> occupied Mount Olympus , while the Tectosagi and the <unk> went to another mountain . On Mount Olympus , the Galatians had fortified themselves with a ditch and other defensive works . For the first two days , the Romans scouted the mountains . On the third day , the Romans attacked the Galatian position with their skirmishers . At first the battle was evenly matched but when the fighting came to close range , the superior Roman weapons and armour won them the battle . The battle turned to a massacre for the Galatians when the Romans stormed their camp . The Galatians lost some 10 @,@ 000 men and had around 40 @,@ 000 captured during the aftermath . 
 = = Battle of Ancyra = = 
 After the Roman victory at Mount Olympus , the Tectosagi begged them not to attack them and asked to meet him for a conference half way between their camp and Ancyra . The main aim of the conference was for the Tectosagi to delay the Roman attack so that they could allow the women and children to retreat across the Halys River . Their other aim was to assassinate Manlius while he was at the conference . While they were going to the conference the Romans saw the Galatian cavalry charging at them . In the skirmish that followed the Galatians overpowered Manlius ' bodyguard due to their numbers but were driven back when the escort that had been accompanying the Roman foragers arrived and forced the Galatians to retreat . 
 The Romans spent the next two days scouting the surrounding area and on the third day they met the Galatian army consisting of 50 @,@ 000 men . The Romans started the battle by attacking with their skirmishers . The Galatian centre shattered at the first attack and fled in the direction of the camp . The flanks stood their grounds for longer but were eventually forced to retreat . The Romans chased them , plundered the Galatian camp as the surviving Galatians fled across the river to join the women , children and the <unk> . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 These two crushing military defeats forced the Galatians to sue for peace . This campaign greatly enriched Vulso and his legions as the Galatians had gathered great wealth through their many conquests in Asia Minor . The Galatians sent envoys to Vulso asking for peace but Vulso who at the time was hurrying back to Ephesus because winter was approaching bade them to come to Ephesus . 
 Vulso remained in Asia Minor for another year . During that time he concluded the Treaty of Apamea with Antiochus and divided the lands of the Asia Minor coast between Pergamum and Rhodes . When the Galatian envoys came , Vulso told them that King Eumenes II of Pergamum would give them the terms of the peace when he arrived back from Rome . 
 Vulso began his return journey to Rome in 188 BC and arrived in 187 BC . When he returned to Rome , he received much of criticism because of his unauthorised war against the Galatians . However , he eventually overcame the arguments and was awarded a triumph by the senate .

 = Capitol Loop = 
 The Capitol Loop is a state trunkline highway running through Lansing , Michigan , in the United States that was commissioned on October 13 , 1989 . It forms a loop route off Interstate 496 ( I @-@ 496 ) through downtown near the Michigan State Capitol complex , home of the state legislature and several state departments . The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) has labeled it as Capitol Loop I @-@ 496 or CL I @-@ 496 on some maps , similar to the Business Loop Interstate nomenclature . However , unlike other business loops in Michigan , it has unique reassurance markers — the signs that serve as regular reminders of the name and number of the highway . It is known internally at MDOT as Connector 496 for inventory purposes . The route follows a series of one @-@ way and two @-@ way streets through downtown Lansing , directing traffic downtown to the State Capitol and other government buildings . Unlike the other streets downtown , the seven streets comprising the Capitol Loop are under state maintenance and jurisdiction . 
 The loop was originally proposed in 1986 as part of a downtown revitalization effort . Almost from the beginning before the highway was commissioned in 1989 , it was affected by controversial proposals . Several suggestions by community leaders to rename city streets in honor of Martin Luther King , Jr. were rejected . In the end , Logan Street was given a second name , Martin Luther King , Jr . Boulevard , and the original name was eventually dropped . 
 Meetings beginning in 1999 dealt with rebuilding the streets as part of a downtown beautification project . The project was delayed to accommodate replacing the sewer system under the roadway at the same time as the streetscaping . The downtown business community protested the original scope of construction , and the Lansing City Council threatened to cancel the project in response to the controversy . Instead of losing the investment in the downtown area , the scope of the project was reduced in scale , and the project was completed in 2005 , three months ahead of schedule . In 2010 , additional controversies surfaced regarding the posting and enforcement of speed limits on city streets in Michigan , including the streets that make up the Capitol Loop . The newest controversy over speed limits is related to compliance with a 2006 state law aimed at eliminating speed traps . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The Capitol Loop serves as a connection between the other state highways in Lansing and the Michigan State Capitol complex . The trunkline starts at the northern end of M @-@ 99 at exit 5 on I @-@ 496 . It runs north on Martin Luther King , Jr . Boulevard , where the street is divided into north- and south @-@ bound sections , each three lanes wide , separated by the Union Missionary Baptist Church off St. Joseph Street . A block north of the church , the sections of the street are divided by a central median north of Lenawee Street . 
 At Allegan Street , the Capitol Loop becomes a one @-@ way pair . Eastbound traffic continues on Allegan Street , passing to the south of the Hall of Justice , home to the Michigan Supreme Court . Westbound traffic is carried on Ottawa Street , one block to the north of Allegan Street . The Hall faces Butler Boulevard , which provides access from Allegan and Ottawa streets . Past Butler Boulevard , traffic passes the north side of the Library of Michigan and Historical Center complex . Between Pine Street and Capitol Avenue , Allegan Street continues south of the Michigan State Capitol . Allegan Street ends at a one @-@ way street , Grand Avenue , and eastbound Capitol Loop turns north on this three @-@ lane street . 
 The two directions of traffic on the Capitol Loop are reunited at the two @-@ way Michigan Avenue . Eastbound traffic turns east along Michigan Avenue ; westbound traffic turns north off Michigan onto Grand Avenue . Michigan Avenue runs with two lanes in each direction and a center turn lane , crossing the Grand River . East of the river , it approaches a complex of museums on Museum Drive , including the Michigan Museum of Surveying , R.E. Olds Transportation Museum ( named for Oldsmobile founder , R.E. Olds ) and the Impression Five Science Museum south of Riverwalk Park . 
 The Capitol Loop meets the one @-@ way pairing of Cedar and Larch streets on Michigan Avenue near Cooley Law School Stadium , home of the Lansing Lugnuts minor league baseball team . Cedar and Larch carry Business Loop Interstate 96 ( BL I @-@ 96 ) . The two highway designations merge and run concurrently along the pair of streets . Eastbound Capitol Loop and eastbound BL I @-@ 96 follow Cedar Street southerly ; westbound Capitol Loop and westbound BL I @-@ 96 are routed northerly on Larch Street . Cedar Street runs southeasterly along the Grand River angling toward Larch Street . The two streets merge where they meet I @-@ 496 . This interchange at exit 7 along I @-@ 496 marks the eastern end of the Capitol Loop , but BL I @-@ 96 continues south of I @-@ 496 on Cedar Street . No part of the Capitol Loop is included on the National Highway System , a system of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 In 2009 , MDOT conducted one of its annual surveys to measure the traffic levels on Michigan trunklines . These surveys calculate the average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a computation of the average traffic levels for a segment of roadway on any given day of the year . Along the Capitol Loop , the highest traffic counts were measured on Martin Luther King , Jr . Boulevard . A daily average of 25 @,@ 513 vehicles used that section of the route . This figure included an AADT of 619 commercial vehicles . Traffic volume drops along Allegan and Ottawa streets , where 2 @,@ 687 and 1 @,@ 499 vehicles used those streets , respectively . The second highest traffic counts were on the section concurrent with BL I @-@ 96 on Cedar and Larch streets . There , 17 @,@ 682 vehicles and 547 trucks used the streets .

 MDOT proposed the Capitol Loop in 1986 . The highway designation was part of a partnership between the State of Michigan and the City of Lansing to revitalize the downtown area . The designation of this highway provided drivers with a signed route to various attractions in the downtown Lansing area . MDOT started implementing plans for the Capitol Loop in May 1986 with improvements to Michigan Avenue . This project included an initial $ 80 @,@ 000 investment ( equivalent to $ 234 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) to streetscaping between the State Capitol and the Grand River . The City of Lansing transferred jurisdiction over the streets involved to MDOT on October 13 , 1989 , allowing the state to commission the trunkline . 
 The route serves the Capitol Park , which was created by an act of the Michigan Legislature in 1984 with the boundaries of Ottawa , Allegan and Logan streets . The fourth side is the vacated section of Sycamore Street between Ottawa and Allegan . The current Library of Michigan building was opened in 1989 . The State Capitol , previously listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 25 , 1971 , was renovated as part of this revitalization effort . The extensive , three @-@ year renovation of the Capitol was completed in 1992 , the same year in which it was designated as a National Historic Landmark . The Hall of Justice was opened in October 2002 , giving the Michigan Supreme Court a permanent home for the first time since the court had vacated the Capitol in 1970 .

 Various proposals to honor Martin Luther King , Jr. in Lansing were floated around 1986 . The Pastor 's Conference of Lansing put forward renaming Logan Street in honor of the civil rights leader , but residents were not supportive of this idea at the time . Another proposal in October 1988 would have renamed Allegan Street because it was shorter and would affect fewer residents . Allegan Street also passes through the city 's black community . Residents objected because the city 's east – west streets were all named for the counties in the state when the city was platted in 1847 . The last failed proposal would have renamed the entire Capitol Loop in King 's honor . This idea failed because the route 's unique markers had already been designed , made and were about to be installed . 
 The conference proposed renaming Logan Street again in 1989 . This time residents objected over the $ 32 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 78 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) to replace the signs . Logan Street was already named for Gen. John A. Logan , who served as a colonel with a Michigan regiment and later as a general in the American Civil War . A compromise by the mayor was adopted by the city council on April 24 , 1989 , to allow both names to be used on the street . This dual @-@ naming arrangement was dropped by the city council on March 28 , 1994 , removing the " Logan Street " name from the street after two years of debate . 
 = = = Reconstruction controversy = = = 
 Officials from the City of Lansing and MDOT announced a two @-@ year , $ 22 million project ( in 2003 , equivalent to $ 31 million in 2015 ) to reconstruct the Capitol Loop on May 22 , 2003 . The project would have closed downtown streets in 2004 and 2005 after preparatory work in late 2003 . MDOT was seeking to rebuild the streets to improve the downtown area around the State Capitol , adding decorative sidewalks , lighting and planting new trees . The city planned to upgrade the sewer system at the same time as part of a 30 @-@ year project to separate the storm and sanitary sewers . MDOT stated that the project would completely close streets along the loop , with the exception of one lane of traffic in each direction along Michigan Avenue . The project was called the " most ambitious since the Interstate 496 construction project in 2001 " by the Lansing State Journal . 
 In the weeks leading up to the November 3 , 2003 , Lansing City Council meeting , businesses that would be affected by the project raised objections to the scope of the project . One business owner circulated a petition signed by 23 businesses asking the city to delay part of the overall project . The project was nicknamed in the press " Lansing 's ' Big Dig ' " because the sewer and utility work required 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 14 m ) excavations in the streets downtown . Some initial opposition was based on a false assumption that the project would close the entire length of the streets at once , instead of in stages . MDOT 's original beautification project was delayed five years , and the city 's mandated sewer separation project was fast @-@ tracked . This combined project , planned for 2004 – 05 , was planned to prevent digging up the same streets twice within 10 – 15 years . Most of the business owners expressed concerns that at the end of the project their businesses might not survive to enjoy the benefits of the downtown beautification . The mayor attempted to get the city council to postpone a vote to stop the issuance of bonds for the city 's portion of the overall project . City council members criticized MDOT 's " [ inflexibility ] about changing the plans to accommodate businesses . " MDOT replied that the contract bids were already out and that it was too late to change the scope of the project . 
 The city council tabled the project , postponing a final decision on approving it until the businesses ' concerns could be addressed . City officials stated a need to redesign the project to accommodate the business community downtown . The project was originally planned in 1999 with votes and hearings by the city council starting in 2001 . The city did not kill the project outright which would have risked the city losing the investment in the downtown infrastructure . Instead , the final decision was delayed for two weeks . Had the project been killed outright , MDOT could have reallocated the funding to any project elsewhere in the state . After the decision to delay the project , Mayor Tony Benavides appointed a task force to work with the businesses to address their concerns . Even the local papers pushed all parties concerned to solve the issues and salvage the project . The city announced a revised plan on November 19 , 2003 , to move parts of the sewer project to a separate timeline so that they would take 16 years to complete . The original 2004 – 05 project was scaled down to encompass the sewer and water main work with the beautification project on Ottawa , Allegan , Pine and Walnut streets with additional work possible on Capitol Avenue . The revised plan drew praise from members of the business community . The revised project , now budgeted at $ 12 million ( in 2003 , equivalent to $ 16 @.@ 9 million in 2015 ) involved work on 14 fewer blocks of the downtown area . The project was approved on December 13 , 2004 . The bids on the contract work were opened on January 21 , 2004 , with the bid awarded to E.T. MacKenzie Company of Grand Ledge .

 Work on the scaled @-@ down Capitol Loop reconstruction project started on April 5 , 2004 . Area businesses prepared in advance of the project for disruptions . The Michigan Supreme Court distributed color @-@ coded brochures to alert employees of changes as a result of the project . The Central Methodist Church at the corner of Capitol Avenue and Ottawa Street lost access to its parking lot , but the city reserved on @-@ street parking for parishioners . The initial stage of the project closed Ottawa Avenue in stages and converted adjacent one @-@ way streets to two @-@ way traffic to accommodate state employees working next to the construction zone . Several sidewalks were closed on one side of affected streets , while the opposite sidewalks remained open . The revised project earned praise in newspaper editorials after construction started . This praise was tempered with caution to motorists and the officials in charge of the project . The former were advised to remember that the scaled @-@ down project was redesigned to accommodate them ; the latter were reminded to get the job done as soon as practical . 
 Business reported that the project did not affect them as much as they had feared before the project . Minor inconveniences were reported , with some commuters recounting only minor delays in trips downtown . The noise was cited as the worst side effect of the project by several residents in media reports . The work on Allegan Street that was originally planned for 2005 was scheduled by MDOT for the 2004 construction season . The project wrapped up for the year in November . Construction resumed on the remaining sections of the project on March 14 , 2005 . This phase included the remaining work on Allegan and Walnut streets . By May , the affected streets were reduced to gravel and completed streets had been reopened . Additional work scheduled for 2005 included streetscaping improvements to Cedar and Larch streets . 
 The project wrapped up three months ahead of the original October completion date . The project cost MDOT $ 15 @.@ 4 million ( in 2005 , equivalent to $ 19 @.@ 4 million in 2015 ) with an additional $ 5 @.@ 6 million paid by the City of Lansing for the sewer work ( in 2003 , equivalent to $ 7 @.@ 06 million in 2015 ) . Lansing 's share of the costs included the reconstruction costs for Walnut and Pine streets , since those streets are not part of the state trunkline system . The completion of the project was marked with a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony to open the streets to traffic on June 30 , 2005 . 
 = = = Speed limit controversy = = = 
 A 2006 Michigan law was enacted to reform how cities in the state set speed limits . Under this law , the streets that comprise the Capitol Loop were <unk> according to the Michigan State Police ( MSP ) . The law was designed to eliminate speed traps in the state by basing the determination of speed limits on scientific criteria . Unless a roadway is in a downtown business district or subdivision , the limit is based on the number of access points , either cross streets or driveways , along the roadway . Exceptions to these classifications can be made based on a technical study by traffic engineers . Lansing city officials stated in March 2009 that by adopting the Uniform Vehicle Code instead of the state 's Motor Vehicle Code , Lansing is immune from the change in law and can enforce the 25 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour ( 40 km / h ) limits . 
 The Lansing city attorney was dismissing speeding tickets issued on the Capitol Loop in June 2010 . The loop was not signed with speed @-@ limit signs , making the tickets unenforceable . The city cannot install the signs on its own because of the state trunkline status of the streets that make up the Capitol Loop ; the MSP and MDOT are in charge of setting and signing the speed limits on state trunklines in Michigan . City Attorney Brig Smith stated that until the state agencies complete the speed study and erect the signs , he cannot enforce any tickets for speeding on the Capitol Loop . MSP and MDOT officials stated that the study is complete and the new signs are on order . The limits were raised from 25 to 30 mph ( 40 to 48 km / h ) on the eastern half of the loop and 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) on the western half as a result of the MDOT and MSP speed studies . State Representative Rick Jones from Grand Ledge has been pushing for scientifically set speed limits in the state to limit speed traps , and he has proposed new legislation to force cities to comply with the 2006 law , ending any loopholes used by cities to set lower limits . As Jones explained to reporters , the current situation is one where " ... streets are artificially posted too low for the purpose of writing tickets . "

 The Day the Earth Stood Still is a 2008 American science fiction film , a remake of the 1951 film of the same name . The screenplay is based on the 1940 classic science fiction short story " Farewell to the Master " by Harry Bates and on the 1951 screenplay adaptation by Edmund H. North . 
 Directed by Scott Derrickson and starring Keanu Reeves as Klaatu , this version replaces the Cold War theme of nuclear warfare with the contemporary issue of humankind 's environmental damage to the planet . It follows Klaatu , an alien sent to try to change human behavior or eradicate humans from Earth . 
 The film was originally scheduled for release on May 9 , 2008 , but was released on a roll @-@ out schedule beginning December 12 , 2008 , screening in both conventional and IMAX theaters . The critical reviews were mainly negative , with 186 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes showing only 21 % of them were positive ; typically the film was found to be " heavy on special effects , but without a coherent story at its base " . In its opening week , the film took top spot at the U.S. box office and went on to gross over $ 233 million worldwide . The Day the Earth Stood Still was released on home video on April 7 , 2009 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 1928 , a solitary mountaineer encounters a glowing sphere . He loses consciousness and when he wakes , the sphere has gone and there is a scar on his hand where a sample of his DNA has been taken . 
 In the present day , a rapidly moving object is detected beyond Jupiter 's orbit and forecast to impact Manhattan . Moving at 30 @,@ 000 kilometers per second , enough to destroy all life on Earth , the United States government hastily assembles a group of scientists , including Dr. Helen Benson and her friend Dr. Michael Granier , to develop a survival plan . 
 As it nears the planet , the object slows down just before impact . Revealed to be a large spherical spaceship , it lands gently in Central Park . The sphere is quickly surrounded by NYPD and heavily armed US military forces . An alien emerges and Helen moves forward to greet it ; but amidst the confusion , the alien is shot . A gigantic robot appears and temporarily disables everything in the vicinity before the wounded alien voices the command " Klaatu barada nikto " to shut down the robot 's defensive response . 
 The alien 's exterior is found to be a bioengineered space suit , composed of placenta @-@ like material covering a human @-@ like being . The being quickly ages into Klaatu , who looks like the mountaineer from 1928 . Klaatu informs Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson that he is a representative of a group of civilizations , sent to talk to the leaders of Earth about saving the planet . When Jackson instead sends him to be interrogated , Klaatu escapes and reconnects with Helen and her stepson , Jacob , telling them that he must finish his mission to " save the Earth " . 
 The presence of the sphere , and other smaller ones that begin to appear all over the world , causes widespread panic . The military launches a drone attack on the Central Park sphere , but are thwarted by the robot . The military takes a weapons @-@ free approach , cautiously enclosing the robot , soon nicknamed " <unk> " ( for Genetically Organized Robotic Technology ) , and transporting it to an underground facility in Virginia . 
 Klaatu meets with another alien , Mr. Wu , who has lived on Earth for 70 years . Wu tells Klaatu that he has found the human race to be destructive , stubborn and unwilling to change , which matches Klaatu 's experiences . Klaatu orders the smaller spheres to collect specimens of animal species , to preserve them for later reintroduction to the Earth . He clarifies for Helen that he means to save the Earth from destruction by humankind . When a policeman attempts to take them into custody , Klaatu kills him then promptly revives the officer , telling Helen and Jacob that he did this to simply disarm an obstacle to his mission . 
 Hoping to persuade Klaatu to change his mind about humanity , Helen takes him to the home of Professor Barnhardt , a Nobel Prize winner . They discuss how Klaatu 's own race went through a drastic , collaborative evolution to prevent the demise of their own planet . Barnhardt pleads that Earth is at the same precipice , and humanity should be given a chance to understand that it too must change . While the adults are talking , Jacob calls the authorities to come and arrest Klaatu . 
 While the military is examining <unk> , the robot transforms into a swarm of winged , insect @-@ like , nano @-@ machines that self @-@ replicate as they consume everything in their path . The swarm soon devours the entire facility , emerging above ground to continue feeding . 
 The military capture Helen while Klaatu and Jacob escape on foot . As they travel , Klaatu learns more about humanity through Jacob . When Jacob contacts Helen and arranges to meet at his father 's grave , the Secretary sends her to try and change Klaatu 's mind . At the grave , Jacob is heartbroken that Klaatu cannot resurrect his long dead father . As Helen and Jacob have a tear @-@ filled reunion , Klaatu 's cumulative observations of humans convinces him to stop the swarm . 
 Dr. Granier drives them to the Central Park sphere , but the swarm has reached massive proportions . Klaatu trudges through the swarm to the sphere , touching it moments before his own body is consumed . The sphere deactivates the swarm , saving humanity , but at the expense of electrical activity on Earth , per Klaatu 's warning that there will be a price to the modern human way of life . The giant sphere leaves the Earth .

 Keanu Reeves as Klaatu , an alien messenger in human form . 
 Reeves dislikes remakes , but was impressed by the script , which he deemed a reimagining . He enjoyed the original film as a child and became fonder of it as an adult when he understood how relevant it was , but prefers this version because it lacked the contradictory message of Klaatu " laying down the law [ ... ] almost as though the alien had the bigger stick . " Reeves acknowledged his Klaatu is " inverted " from the original , starting " sinister and tough " but becoming " more human , " whereas the original was " more human than human " before revealing his " big stick " in his ending speech . He compared the remake 's Klaatu to the wrathful God who floods the world in the Old Testament , but is gentle and forgiving by the time of the New Testament . He spent many weeks revising the script , trying to make Klaatu 's transition from alien in human form to one who appreciates their emotions and beliefs subtle and nuanced . Derrickson , the director , said that although Reeves would not use actions " that are highly unusual or highly quirky " , he nevertheless " keeps you aware of the fact that this being you 're walking through this movie with is not a human being . " At Reeves ' insistence , the classic line " Klaatu barada nikto " was added to the script after initially being omitted . The line was recorded many times , and it was decided to combine two recordings : one where Reeves said it normally , and a reversed version where he said the line backwards , creating an " alien " effect . 
 Jennifer Connelly as Helen Benson , a famed astrobiologist at Princeton University who is recruited by the government to study Klaatu . 
 Connelly was Derrickson 's first choice for the part . She is a fan of the original film and felt Patricia Neal 's original portrayal of Helen was " fabulous " , but trusted the filmmakers with their reinterpretation of the story and of Helen , who was a secretary in the original . Connelly emphasized that Helen is amazed when she meets Klaatu , as she never believed she would encounter a sentient alien like him , after speculating on extraterrestrial life for so long . Connelly was dedicated to understanding her scientific jargon , with Seth Shostak stating she did " everything short of writing a NASA grant application " . 
 Kathy Bates as Regina Jackson , the United States Secretary of Defense . 
 Bates had only two weeks to film her scenes , so she often requested Derrickson act out her lines so she would directly understand his aims for her dialogue , rather than interpret vague directions . 
 Jaden Smith as Jacob Benson , Helen 's rebellious eight @-@ year @-@ old stepson . His conflict with his stepmother was worsened by the death of his father , and he initially dislikes Klaatu , believing him to be a potential stepfather . Jacob replaces the character of Bobby ( Billy Gray ) in the original , and his relationship with Helen was written as a microcosm of how Klaatu comes to see humanity – the alien sees their cold and distant relationship as normal human behavior , and their reconciliation forces him to change his mind . 
 Smith had met Keanu Reeves before - on the set of The Matrix sequels , which featured his mother Jada Pinkett @-@ Smith - although he was only three years old at the time . 
 John Cleese as Professor Karl Barnhardt , a Nobel Prize @-@ winning physicist who specializes in the evolutionary basis of altruism . Helen takes Klaatu to him to further change his mind .
