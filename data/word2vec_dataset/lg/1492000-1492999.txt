 The highlight of Croatia 's recent infrastructure developments is its rapidly developed motorway network , largely built in the late 1990s and especially in the 2000s ( decade ) . By September 2011 , Croatia had completed more than 1 @,@ 100 kilometres ( 680 miles ) of motorways , connecting Zagreb to most other regions and following various European routes and four Pan @-@ European corridors . The busiest motorways are the A1 , connecting Zagreb to Split and the A3 , passing east – west through northwest Croatia and Slavonia . A widespread network of state roads in Croatia acts as motorway feeder roads while connecting all major settlements in the country . The high quality and safety levels of the Croatian motorway network were tested and confirmed by several EuroTAP and <unk> programs . 
 Croatia has an extensive rail network spanning 2 @,@ 722 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 691 miles ) , including 984 kilometres ( 611 miles ) of electrified railways and 254 kilometres ( 158 miles ) of double track railways . The most significant railways in Croatia are found within the Pan @-@ European transport corridors Vb and X connecting Rijeka to Budapest and Ljubljana to Belgrade , both via Zagreb . All rail services are operated by Croatian Railways . 
 There are international airports in Zagreb , Zadar , Split , Dubrovnik , Rijeka , Osijek and Pula . The largest and busiest is Franjo Tuđman Airport . As of January 2011 , Croatia complies with International Civil Aviation Organization aviation safety standards and the Federal Aviation Administration upgraded it to Category 1 rating . 
 The busiest cargo seaport in Croatia is the Port of Rijeka and the busiest passenger ports are Split and Zadar . In addition to those , a large number of minor ports serve an extensive system of ferries connecting numerous islands and coastal cities in addition to ferry lines to several cities in Italy . The largest river port is Vukovar , located on the Danube , representing the nation 's outlet to the Pan @-@ European transport corridor VII . 
 There are 610 kilometres ( 380 miles ) of crude oil pipelines in Croatia , connecting the Port of Rijeka oil terminal with refineries in Rijeka and Sisak , as well as several transhipment terminals . The system has a capacity of 20 million tonnes per year . The natural gas transportation system comprises 2 @,@ 113 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 313 miles ) of trunk and regional natural gas pipelines , and more than 300 associated structures , connecting production rigs , the Okoli natural gas storage facility , 27 end @-@ users and 37 distribution systems . 
 Croatian production of energy sources covers 85 % of nationwide natural gas demand and 19 % of oil demand . In 2008 , 47 @.@ 6 % of Croatia 's primary energy production structure comprised use of natural gas ( 47 @.@ 7 % ) , crude oil ( 18 @.@ 0 % ) , fuel wood ( 8 @.@ 4 % ) , hydro power ( 25 @.@ 4 % ) and other renewable energy sources ( 0 @.@ 5 % ) . In 2009 , net total electrical power production in Croatia reached 12 @,@ 725 GWh and Croatia imported 28 @.@ 5 % of its electric power energy needs . The bulk of Croatian imports are supplied by the Krško Nuclear Power Plant , 50 % owned by Hrvatska elektroprivreda , providing 15 % of Croatia 's electricity . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 With its population of 4 @.@ 28 million in 2011 , Croatia ranks 125th by population in the world . Its population density stands at 75 @.@ 9 inhabitants per square kilometre . The overall life expectancy in Croatia at birth was 78 years in 2012 . The total fertility rate of 1 @.@ 5 children per mother , is one of the lowest in the world . Since 1991 , Croatia 's death rate has continuously exceeded its birth rate . Since the late 1990s , there has been a positive net migration into Croatia , reaching a level of more than 7 @,@ 000 net immigrants in 2006 . According to the 2013 United Nations report , 17 @.@ 6 % of Croatia 's population were foreign @-@ born immigrants . 
 The Croatian Bureau of Statistics forecast that the population may shrink to 3 @.@ 1 million by 2051 , depending on actual birth rate and the level of net migration . The population of Croatia rose steadily from 2 @.@ 1 million in 1857 until 1991 , when it peaked at 4 @.@ 7 million , with exception of censuses taken in 1921 and 1948 , i.e. following two world wars . The natural growth rate of the population is currently negative with the demographic transition completed in the 1970s . In recent years , the Croatian government has been pressured each year to add 40 % to work permit quotas for foreign workers . In accordance with its immigration policy , Croatia is trying to entice emigrants to return . 
 The population decrease was also a result of the Croatian War of Independence . During the war , large sections of the population were displaced and emigration increased . In 1991 , in predominantly Serb areas , more than 400 @,@ 000 Croats and other non @-@ Serbs were either removed from their homes by the Croatian Serb forces or fled the violence . During the final days of the war in 1995 , more than 120 @,@ 000 Serbs , and perhaps as many as 200 @,@ 000 , fled the country before arrival of Croatian forces during Operation Storm . Within a decade following the end of the war , only 117 @,@ 000 Serb refugees returned out of 300 @,@ 000 displaced during the entire war . Most of Croatia 's remaining Serbs never lived in areas occupied in the Croatian War of Independence . Serbs have been only partially re @-@ settled in the regions they previously inhabited while some of the settlements previously inhabited by Serbs were settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina , mostly from Republika Srpska . 
 Croatia is inhabited mostly by Croats ( 90 @.@ 4 % ) and is ethnically the most homogeneous of the six countries of former Yugoslavia . Minority groups include Serbs ( 4 @.@ 4 % ) , Bosniaks , Hungarians , Italians , Slovenes , Germans , Czechs , Romani people and others ( 5 @.@ 9 % ) . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Croatia has no official religion and Freedom of religion is a right defined by the Constitution of Croatia , which also defines all religious communities as equal in front of the law and separate from the state . 
 The most predominant religion in Croatia is Christianity and a large majority of the Croatian population declares themselves as members of the Roman Catholic Church . The main religions of Croatia are Roman Catholicism 86 @.@ 28 % , Eastern Orthodoxy 4 @.@ 44 % , Protestantism 0 @.@ 34 % , other Christianity 0 @.@ 30 % , and Islam 1 @.@ 47 % . 
 = = = Languages = = = 
 Croatian is the official language of Croatia , and became the 24th official language of the European Union upon its accession in 2013 . Minority languages are in official use in local government units where more than a third of population consists of national minorities or where local legislation defines so . Those languages are Czech , Hungarian , Italian , Ruthenian , Serbian and Slovakian . 
 According to the 2011 Census , 95 @.@ 6 % of citizens of Croatia declared Croatian as their native language , 1 @.@ 2 % declared Serbian as their native language , while no other language is represented in Croatia by more than 0 @.@ 5 % of native speakers among population of Croatia . Croatian is a South Slavic language . Most Croatian vocabulary is derived from the Slavic branch of the Indo @-@ European language family . Croatian is written using the Latin alphabet . Croatian has three major dialects , with <unk> dialect used as the standard Croatian and Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects distinguished by their lexicon , phonology , and syntax . 
 From 1961 to 1991 , the official language was Serbo @-@ Croatian . Even during socialist rule , Croats often referred to their language as Croato @-@ Serbian ( instead of Serbo @-@ Croatian ) or as Croatian . Croatian and Serbian variants of the language were not officially recognised as different at the time , but referred to as the west and east version , and had different alphabets : the Latin alphabet and Serbian Cyrillic . Croatians are protective of their Croatian language from foreign influences , as the language was under constant change and threats imposed by previous rulers ( i.e. Austrian German , Hungarian , Italian and Turkish words were changed and altered to " Slavic " looking / sounding ones ) . Efforts made to impose policies to alter Croatian into " Serbo @-@ Croatian " or " South Slavic " language , met resistance from Croats in form of Croatian linguistic purism . Croatian replaced Latin as the official language of the Croatian government in the 19th century . 
 A 2011 survey revealed that 78 % of Croatians claim knowledge of at least one foreign language . According to a survey ordered by the European Commission in 2005 , 49 % of Croatians speak English as the second language , 34 % speak German , and 14 % speak Italian . French and Russian are spoken by 4 % each , and 2 % of Croatians speak Spanish . A substantial proportion of Slovenes ( 59 % ) have a certain level of knowledge of Croatian . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 Literacy in Croatia stands at 99 @.@ 2 per cent . A worldwide study about the quality of living in different countries published by Newsweek in August 2010 ranked the Croatian education system at 22nd , to share the position with Austria . Primary education in Croatia starts at the age of six or seven and consists of eight grades . In 2007 a law was passed to increase free , <unk> education until 18 years of age . Compulsory education consists of eight grades of elementary school . Secondary education is provided by gymnasiums and vocational schools . As of 2010 , there are 2 @,@ 131 elementary schools and 713 schools providing various forms of secondary education . Primary and secondary education are also available in languages of recognised minorities in Croatia , where classes are held in Czech , Hungarian , Italian , Serbian and German languages . 
 There are 84 elementary level and 47 secondary level music and art schools , as well as 92 schools for disabled children and youth and 74 schools for adults . Nationwide leaving exams ( Croatian : državna matura ) were introduced for secondary education students in the school year 2009 – 2010 . It comprises three compulsory subjects ( Croatian language , mathematics , and a foreign language ) and optional subjects and is a prerequisite for university education . 
 Croatia has eight universities , the University of Zagreb , University of Split , University of Rijeka , University of Osijek , University of Zadar , University of Dubrovnik , University of Pula and Dubrovnik International University . The University of Zadar , the first university in Croatia , was founded in 1396 and remained active until 1807 , when other institutions of higher education took over until the foundation of the renewed University of Zadar in 2002 . The University of Zagreb , founded in 1669 , is the oldest continuously operating university in Southeast Europe . There are also 11 polytechnics and 23 higher education institutions , of which 19 are private . In total , there are 132 institutions of higher education in Croatia , attended by more than 145 thousand students . 
 There are 205 companies , government or education system institutions and non @-@ profit organisations in Croatia pursuing scientific research and development of technology . Combined , they spent more than 3 billion kuna ( € 400 million ) and employed 10 @,@ 191 full @-@ time research staff in 2008 . Among the scientific institutes operating in Croatia , the largest is the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb . The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb is a learned society promoting language , culture , arts and science from its inception in 1866 . Croatia has also produced inventors and two Croatians received the Nobel Prize . 
 = = = Health = = = 
 Croatia has a universal health care system , whose roots can be traced back to the Hungarian @-@ Croatian Parliament Act of 1891 , providing a form of mandatory insurance of all factory workers and craftsmen . The population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided by statute and optional insurance . In 2012 , annual healthcare related expenditures reached 21 @.@ 0 billion kuna ( € 2 @.@ 8 billion ) . Healthcare expenditures comprise only 0 @.@ 6 % of private health insurance and public spending . In 2010 , Croatia spent 6 @.@ 9 % of its GDP on healthcare . 
 Croatia ranked around the 40th in the world in life expectancy with 74 years for men and 81 years for women , and it had a low infant mortality rate of 5 per 1 @,@ 000 live births . 
 There are hundreds of healthcare institutions in Croatia , including 79 hospitals and clinics with 23 @,@ 967 beds . The hospitals and clinics care for more than 700 thousand patients per year and employ 5 @,@ 205 medical doctors , including 3 @,@ 929 specialists . There are 6 @,@ 379 private practice offices , and a total of 41 @,@ 271 health workers in the country . There are 63 emergency medical service units , responding to more than a million calls . The principal cause of death in 2008 was cardiovascular disease at 43 @.@ 5 % for men and 57 @.@ 2 % for women , followed by tumours , at 29 @.@ 4 % for men and 21 @.@ 4 % for women . In 2009 only 13 Croatians had been infected with HIV / AIDS and 6 had died from the disease . In 2008 it was estimated by the WHO that 27 @.@ 4 % of Croatians over age of 15 are smokers . According to 2003 WHO data , 22 % of the Croatian adult population is obese . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Because of its geographic position , Croatia represents a blend of four different cultural spheres . It has been a crossroad of influences of the western culture and the east — ever since division of the Western Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire — as well as of the Mitteleuropa and the Mediterranean culture . The Illyrian movement was the most significant period of national cultural history , as the 19th @-@ century period proved crucial in emancipation of the Croatian language and saw unprecedented developments in all fields of art and culture , giving rise to a number of historical figures . 
 The Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia is tasked with preserving the nation 's cultural and natural heritage and overseeing its development . Further activities supporting development of culture are undertaken at local government level . The UNESCO inscribed seven sites in Croatia on the World Heritage List . The country is also rich with Intangible culture and holds ten of UNESCO 's World 's intangible culture masterpieces , surpassing all countries in Europe except Spain which possesses an equal number of the listed items . A global cultural contribution from Croatia is the necktie , derived from the cravat originally worn by the 17th @-@ century Croatian mercenaries in France . 
 As of 2012 , Croatia has 60 professional theatres , 17 professional children 's theatres and 60 amateur theatres visited by more than 1 @.@ 8 million viewers per year . The professional theatres employ 1 @,@ 121 artists . There are 23 professional orchestras , ensembles and choirs in the country , attracting an annual attendance of 294 thousand . There are 162 cinemas with attendance exceeding 4 million . Croatia has 175 museums , visited by nearly 2 @.@ 2 million people in 2009 . Furthermore , there are 1 @,@ 731 libraries in the country , containing 24 @.@ 5 million volumes , and 18 archives . 
 In 2009 , more than 7 @,@ 200 books and brochures were published , along with 2 @,@ 678 magazines and 314 newspapers . There are also 146 radio stations and 21 TV stations operating in the country . In past five years , film production in Croatia produced up to five feature films and 10 to 51 short films , with an additional 76 to 112 TV films . As of 2009 , there are 784 amateur cultural and artistic associations and more than 10 thousand cultural , educational and artistic events held annually . The book publishing market is dominated by several major publishers and the industry 's centrepiece event — <unk> exhibition held annually at Zagreb Fair . 
 Croatia has established a high level of human development and gender equality in terms of the Human Development Index . It promotes disability rights . Recognition of same @-@ sex unions in Croatia has gradually improved over the past decade , culminating in registered civil unions in July 2014 , granting same @-@ sex couples equal inheritance rights , tax deductions and limited adoption rights . However , in December 2013 Croatians voted in favour of a constitutional referendum , backed by conservative groups , defining marriage as a " life union of woman and man " . 
 = = = Arts and literature = = = 
 Architecture in Croatia reflects influences of bordering nations . Austrian and Hungarian influence is visible in public spaces and buildings in the north and in the central regions , architecture found along coasts of Dalmatia and Istria exhibits Venetian influence . Large squares named after culture heroes , well @-@ groomed parks , and pedestrian @-@ only zones , are features of these orderly towns and cities , especially where large scale Baroque urban planning took place , for instance in Osijek ( Tvrđa ) , Varaždin and Karlovac . Subsequent influence of the Art Nouveau was reflected in contemporary architecture . Along the coast , the architecture is Mediterranean with a strong Venetian and Renaissance influence in major urban areas exemplified in works of Giorgio da Sebenico and Niccolò Fiorentino such as the Cathedral of St. James in Šibenik . The oldest preserved examples of Croatian architecture are the 9th @-@ century churches , with the largest and the most representative among them being Donatus of Zadar . 
 Besides the architecture encompassing the oldest artworks in Croatia , there is a long history of artists in Croatia reaching to the Middle Ages . In that period the stone portal of the Trogir Cathedral was made by Radovan , representing the most important monument of Romanesque sculpture from Medieval Croatia . The Renaissance had the greatest impact on the Adriatic Sea coast since the remainder of Croatia was embroiled in the Hundred Years ' Croatian – Ottoman War . With the waning of the Ottoman Empire , art flourished during the Baroque and Rococo . The 19th and the 20th centuries brought about affirmation of numerous Croatian artisans , helped by several patrons of the arts such as bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer . Croatian artists of the period achieving worldwide renown were Vlaho Bukovac and Ivan Meštrović . 
 The Baška tablet , a stone inscribed with the <unk> alphabet found on the Krk island and dated to 1100 , is considered to be the oldest surviving prose in Croatian . The beginning of more vigorous development of Croatian literature is marked by the Renaissance and Marko Marulić . Besides Marulić , Renaissance playwright Marin <unk> , Baroque poet Ivan <unk> , Croatian national revival poet Ivan Mažuranić , novelist , playwright and poet August Šenoa , poet and writer Antun Gustav <unk> , poet Antun Branko Šimić , expressionist and realist writer Miroslav Krleža , poet Tin <unk> and novelist and short story writer Ivo Andrić are often cited as the greatest figures in Croatian literature . 
 = = = Media = = = 
 The freedom of the press and the freedom of speech are guaranteed by the constitution of Croatia . Croatia ranked 62nd in the 2010 Press Freedom Index report compiled by Reporters Without Borders . The state @-@ owned news agency <unk> runs a wire service in Croatian and English on politics , economics , society and culture . 
 Nevertheless , despite the provisions fixed in the constitution , freedoms of press and speech in Croatia have been classified as partly free since 2000 by Freedom House , the independent nongovernmental organisation that monitors press freedom worldwide . Namely the country has been ranked 85th ( of 196 countries ) , and the 2011 Freedom House report noted improvement of applicable legislation reflecting Croatia 's accession to the EU , yet pointed out instances of politicians ' attempts to hinder investigative journalism and influence news reports contents , difficulties regarding public access to information , and that most of print media market is controlled by German @-@ owned <unk> Holding and Austrian @-@ owned Styria Media Group . Amnesty International reports that in 2009 in Croatia there was an increase in the number of physical attacks and murders of journalists . The incidents were mainly perpetrated against journalists investigating war crimes and organised crime . 
 As of October 2011 , there are nine nationwide free @-@ to @-@ air DVB @-@ T television channels , with Croatian Radiotelevision ( HRT ) , Nova TV and RTL Televizija operating two of the channels each , and the remaining three operated by the Croatian Olympic Committee , Kapital Net d.o.o. and Author d.o.o. companies . In addition there are 21 regional or local DVB @-@ T television channels . The HRT is also broadcasting a satellite TV channel . In 2012 , there were 146 radio stations and 25 TV stations in Croatia . Cable television and IPTV networks are gaining ground in the country , as the cable TV networks already serve 450 thousand people , 10 % of the total population of the country . 
 There are 314 newspapers and 2 @,@ 678 magazines published in Croatia . The print media market is dominated by <unk> Holding and Styria Media Group who publish their flagship dailies Jutarnji list , Večernji list and <unk> . Other influential newspapers are Novi list and <unk> Dalmacija . In 2013 , <unk> was the most widely circulated daily newspaper , followed by Večernji list and Jutarnji list . 
 Croatia 's film industry is small and heavily subsidised by the government , mainly through grants approved by the Ministry of Culture with films often being co @-@ produced by HRT . Pula Film Festival , the national film awards event held annually in Pula , is the most prestigious film event featuring national and international productions . The greatest accomplishment by Croatian filmmakers was achieved by Dušan <unk> when he won the 1961 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for Ersatz ( Croatian : <unk> ) . 
 = = = Cuisine = = = 
 Croatian traditional cuisine varies from one region to another . Dalmatia and Istria draw upon culinary influences of Italian and other Mediterranean cuisines which prominently feature various seafood , cooked vegetables and pasta , as well as condiments such as olive oil and garlic . The continental cuisine is heavily influenced by Hungarian , Austrian and Turkish culinary styles . In that area , meats , freshwater fish and vegetable dishes are predominant . 
 There are two distinct wine @-@ producing regions in Croatia . The continental region in the north @-@ east of the country , especially Slavonia is capable of producing premium wines , particularly whites . Along the north coast , Istrian and Krk wines are similar to those produced in neighbouring Italy , while further south in Dalmatia , Mediterranean @-@ style red wines are the norm . Annual production of wine exceeds 140 million litres . Croatia was almost exclusively a wine @-@ consuming country up until the late 18th century when a more massive production and consumption of beer started , the annual consumption of beer in 2008 was 83 @.@ 3 litres per capita which placed Croatia on a relatively high 15th place among the world 's countries .

The Prva HNL football league attracts the highest average attendance of any professional sports league in the country . In season 2010 – 11 , it attracted 458 @,@ 746 spectators . 
 Croatian athletes competing at international events since Croatian independence in 1991 won 34 Olympic medals , including ten gold medals — at the 2012 Summer Olympics in discus throw , trap shooting , and water polo ; at the 1996 Summer Olympics and the 2004 Summer Olympics in handball , at the 2000 Summer Olympics in weightlifting and four gold medals in alpine skiing at the 2002 Winter Olympics and the 2006 Winter Olympics . In addition , Croatian athletes won 13 gold medals at world championships , including two in athletics at the World Championships in Athletics held in 2007 and 2009 , one in handball at the 2003 World Men 's Handball Championship , one in water polo at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships , one in rowing at the 2010 World Rowing Championships , six in alpine skiing at the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships held in 2003 and 2005 and two at the World Taekwondo Championships in 2011 and 2007 . Croatian athletes also won the 2005 Davis Cup . 
 Croatia hosted several major sport competitions , including the 2009 World Men 's Handball Championship , the 2007 World Table Tennis Championships , the 2000 World Rowing Championships , the 1987 Summer Universiade , the 1979 Mediterranean Games and several European Championships . The governing sports authority in the country is the Croatian Olympic Committee ( Croatian : Hrvatski <unk> <unk> ) , founded on 10 September 1991 and recognised by the International Olympic Committee since 17 January 1992 , in time to permit the Croatian athletes to appear at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville , France representing the newly independent nation for the first time at the Olympic Games . 
 = Minnesota Golden Gophers men 's basketball = 
 The Minnesota Golden Gophers men 's basketball team represents the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus . The Golden Gophers have played in the Big Ten since the conference began sponsoring basketball in 1905 and play their home games in Williams Arena . The Gophers also have a huge rivalry with Wisconsin Badgers . 
 The Gophers had great success in the early years of basketball , but have been largely overshadowed by other programs since the end of World War I. In total , the Gophers have won nine Big Ten championships , but only four since 1919 . College basketball research organizations have retroactively awarded Minnesota national championships in 1902 , 1903 , and 1919 . 
 The team has also had several instances of NCAA sanctions on the program that have affected performance and recruiting . In the 1970s , the Gophers were in a violent brawl with the Ohio State Buckeyes and were barred from post @-@ season appearances for two seasons after an incident involving the illegal resale of tickets . Still more severe was the mid @-@ 1990s academic scandal under then @-@ coach Clem Haskins that resulted in the forfeit of a Final Four appearance . 
 = = Coaches = = 
 Initially , the Gophers team formed without any organized coach . L. J. Cooke took over the team in 1897 . Cooke was put on the University payroll on a part @-@ time basis in early 1897 and full @-@ time by the fall ; this made him one of the earliest professional coaches . 
 Cooke remained the coach of the Gophers for 28 seasons , and his .649 winning percentage is the second highest in school history . Dave MacMillan , who coached the team from 1927 to 1942 and 1945 to 1948 , had the second longest tenure as coach at 18 seasons . John Wooden almost succeeded McMillan as Gophers head coach ; Wooden claims that a dispute over retaining McMillan as an assistant coach and a delayed phone call led him to accept the job at UCLA instead . 
 The Gophers have had several NBA coaches grace the sidelines . John Kundla took over as Gophers head coach after the Minneapolis Lakers departed for Los Angeles . Bill Fitch and Bill Musselman both coached the team for a couple seasons before departing for the NBA and ABA respectively , where each had success and coached for many years . 
 The program has had a fair degree of stability with their coaching staff . Tubby Smith became the 16th head coach in Gopher basketball history when hired in 2007 ; this total includes interim coaches Jim Molinari and Jimmy Williams . Five coaches led the team for more than 10 seasons : Cooke , McMillan , O. B. Cowles , Jim Dutcher , and Clem Haskins . On March 25 , 2013 , Tubby Smith was fired after failing to reach the Sweet Sixteen again . The Gophers hired Richard Pitino on April 3 , 2013 . 
 = = Players = = 
 The Golden Gophers have had many successful players come through the program throughout its history . In the early years of basketball , when the Gophers had success , they recruited some of the best players in the country . George Tuck was a dominant center , and the first All @-@ America for the Gophers in 1905 . Frank Lawler was another early star : he led the Big Ten in scoring in 1911 and was also named to the All @-@ America team , and helped the Gophers to a contested conference title . 
 In 1950 , Lawler was named the greatest player in Gopher basketball history , but the subsequent decades of Gopher basketball have largely forgotten his legacy . Hall of Fame coach John Kundla was also a Gophers star and helped lead the team to its 1937 Big Ten Championship . 
 With the decline of the stature of the Gophers program , fewer elite players have joined the team . The diminished reputation has not , however , prevented some superior athletes from coming to the Minneapolis campus . Lou Hudson played thirteen years in the NBA and had his number retired . Baseball Hall of Famer Dave Winfield played for the Gophers in the early 1970s , and he played at the same time as star post player Jim Brewer . Mychal Thompson was a Gophers star and was the first overall pick in the 1978 NBA Draft . Among Thompson 's teammates were former Minnesota Timberwolves , Detroit Pistons and Washington Wizards head coach Flip Saunders , as well as basketball hall of fame forward Kevin McHale . Trent Tucker led the 1982 squad to the Big Ten Championship . <unk> Lenard was a key player for the Gophers in the early 1990s and went on to play more than a decade in the NBA . Willie Burton once scored 53 points in an NBA game with the Philadelphia 76ers . Other former Gophers with long NBA careers include Randy Breuer , Mark <unk> , Archie Clark , and Ray Williams . Five players from the 1997 Final Four team played in the NBA : Bobby Jackson , Sam Jacobson , Quincy Lewis , John Thomas , and Trevor Winter . Currently several former Gophers play in the NBA , including Joel Przybilla and Kris Humphries . Jamal Abu @-@ <unk> , a Jordanian @-@ American , plays internationally for the Jordan national basketball team .

 The precise founding of the Gophers men 's basketball program at the University of Minnesota is somewhat nebulous . Unlike many other universities with later foundations , the team did not form as a conscious act of the campus administration . The University 's student newspaper at the time , the Ariel , reported on basketball throughout 1895 as the sport was introduced to the campus from a rival school , Minnesota A & M in St. Paul , later incorporated into the larger University of Minnesota Twin Cities . In 1896 , a team from the school began to participate in a league with the Agriculture school , YMCA teams , and other local associations . The establishment of the Armory on @-@ campus gave the team a new place to play . In February 1897 , L. J. Cooke , a director of the Minneapolis YMCA , was hired on a part @-@ time basis to coach the basketball program , and became the full @-@ time coach and director of physical education by the fall of that year . Cooke was one of the first full @-@ time professional coaches in all of college basketball and would remain at the program for 28 seasons . 
 Cooke began to improve the team significantly and was responsible for shifts in the Gophers ' scheduling that foreshadowed other changes to come . The team never played a YMCA team after the 1903 – 04 season , and beginning in 1900 , began to schedule large neighboring universities that would join Minnesota in Big Ten competition . This shift to playing similar competition helped the Gophers to become one of the premier programs in the nation . From the 1899 – 00 to 1903 – 04 seasons , the Gophers had a 59 – 6 record . The 1901 – 02 squad has been retroactively named the national champions by both the Helms Foundation and the <unk> @-@ Porretta Power Poll ; the <unk> @-@ Porretta poll also names the 1902 – 03 Gophers as national champions . When the Big Ten established basketball in 1905 , the Gophers won the first two conference titles . 
 After 1907 , Cooke 's dominance of the national basketball scene was greatly reduced . He led the team to two more conference titles ( 1916 – 17 , 1918 – 19 ) , and one consensus retroactive national championship for the 1918 – 19 season , but the team was never the consistent winner that it was in the first decade under Cooke . He retired after the 1923 – 1924 season . His successor , Harold Taylor , was Cooke 's assistant coach in his final season and had previously a successful high school coach ; however , he had little success with the Gophers and was fired after never finishing higher than sixth in the conference in three forgettable seasons . 
 = = = Dave MacMillan and beyond ( 1927 – 1959 ) = = = 
 Following the firing of Harold Taylor as coach , the program underwent a national search for a successor . Many of the candidates for the job were high profile coaches of other conference foes . The team opted , however , to hire Dave MacMillan , who had been coaching the University of Idaho for the previous seven seasons and had previously played for the Original Celtics during the 1910s . McMillan would dominate the program for the next thirty years , coaching the team from 1927 to 1942 and again from 1945 to 1948 . 
 McMillan 's teams in 1928 began to play in the University of Minnesota Field House , a new on @-@ campus arena . Basketball had been off @-@ campus for several seasons when the team moved downtown . McMillan 's teams had middling success . His 1930 – 31 and 1931 – 32 teams competed near the top of the Big Ten , but his teams dropped off again until 1936 . John Kundla joined the team for the 1936 – 1937 season and helped the team to the Big Ten Championship , which was ended up being its last until 1972 . McMillan 's squad also competed in a tournament in 1936 to represent the United States in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin ; the team advanced several rounds before being ousted by DePaul . Many Gophers players in this era were recruited from Minneapolis public high schools , and in some seasons this even constituted a majority of the roster . McMillan resigned in 1942 , but returned in 1945 after three poor seasons for the Gophers in the interim . When he resigned for the second time in 1948 , he was replaced by O. B. Cowles . 
 Cowles was known for playing slower tempo basketball like was most common in the 1920s and 1930s and was known as a defensive @-@ minded coach , especially early in his career . His squads were led by two @-@ time All @-@ American Jim McIntyre and three @-@ time NBA Champion Whitey <unk> for the early years of his career and Big Ten MVP Chuck <unk> for the middle ones . Another notable Gophers star from the era was Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Bud Grant . Cowles squads were consistent winners , and he had a <unk> winning percentage at the school . The Gophers were unable to win a Big Ten title , however , despite a solid nucleus in Cowles ' early seasons . The team finished fourth or better in the conference seven times in Cowles ' eleven seasons as Gophers head coach . 
 = = = Kundla and Fitch ( 1959 – 1971 ) = = = 
 In 1959 , John Kundla stayed behind in Minneapolis as the Lakers prepared to leave town and succeeded O. B. Cowles as head coach of the Golden Gophers . Kundla remained head coach until 1968 . In 1963 , he broke the color barrier in the Minnesota program and recruited three African @-@ American players to come to the school . One of these first three players was Lou Hudson , who played in the NBA and was the first Gopher to have his number retired by the school . The other two players recruited by Kundla , Archie Clark and Don Yates , also were both drafted by NBA teams . That trio helped the Gophers to a third place Big Ten finish in 1963 – 64 and a second @-@ place finish in 1964 – 65 , but those were the high points for Kundla 's collegiate career . Kundla 's personal assessment of his Gophers career was that his personal weaknesses in recruiting were marring the team by the end of his tenure . 
 Kundla was succeeded by Bowling Green head coach Bill Fitch . Fitch remained with the Gophers for two seasons before being hired by the Cleveland Cavaliers as their first head coach in 1970 to make the leap to the NBA , where he later won an NBA title as coach of the Boston Celtics . Fitch did recruit Jim Brewer before he left , laying the first seed for the 1972 Big Ten title . George Hanson , a longtime assistant coach at the school , was hired as his replacement , but resigned after only one season . 
 = = = Musselman and NCAA sanctions ( 1971 – 1975 ) = = = 
 The Gophers under Athletics Director Marsh Ryman hired Cal Luther away from Murray State to coach the team in 1971 , but he changed his mind and turned the team down after accepting the position . Instead , Bill Musselman took over the program . Musselman was a defensive minded coach and designed his team around Brewer , recruiting several junior college players . University of Minnesota baseball star Dave Winfield walked on as the sixth man after the Ohio State incident . The starters on the 1971 – 72 squad after Ohio State became known as the " Iron Five . " Musselman 's strategy succeeded , and the team took the Big Ten title , the first since 1937 . The other Big Ten coaches did not approve of Musselman 's recruiting posture as they all had gathered and agreed not to recruit Ron <unk> into the Big Ten because he was known as a troublemaker . Musselman had not been named Head Coach of Minnesota at that time and therefore was unaware of the internal agreement and therefore recruited what he thought were the best players available . 
 In 1973 , former player Greg Olson accused Musselman of having attempted to strike him in a practice . It was also revealed that Olson had sold complimentary season tickets to a booster named Harvey Mackay , which prompted NCAA investigations . Musselman 's coaching style also brought about significant transfers away from the Minnesota program to other schools . In 1975 , Musselman resigned and was named the head coach of the San Diego Sails of the ABA . After his resignation , Musselman admitted to giving money to players for rent and transportation . These charges , coupled with the earlier ticket selling scandal and other transgressions regarding payments and aid revolving around Harvey Mackay , resulted in a list from the NCAA of more than 100 rule violations in Musselman 's four seasons at the school . The extent of the consequences would not be known until early in Jim Dutcher 's eleven season tenure as Gophers head coach . 
 = = = Success , and scandal , under Haskins ( 1986 – 1999 ) = = = 
 Clem Haskins was hired as the Gopher basketball coach in 1986 , expected to clean up and rebuild the Gopher program which had been torn apart by the Madison sexual assault allegations ( of which the players were later acquitted ) during the final year of coach Jim Dutcher . Though wins did not come easily in the first couple years of Haskins regime , by the 1988 – 89 season he had the Gophers in the NCAA tournament as a # 11 seed , and directed a Cinderella run into the Sweet 16 . In the 1989 – 90 season Haskins led the Gophers to the Elite Eight , and the team came within a basket of reaching their first ever Final Four . Though Haskins led the Gophers to post @-@ season success in his first three seasons , the 1990 Elite Eight appearance would be the last time under Haskins the Gophers would " officially " appear in the NCAA tournament . 
 = = = = Academic fraud scandal = = = = 
 On March 10 , 1999 , the day before the # 7 seed Gophers were to open the NCAA tournament against # 10 Gonzaga , the St. Paul Pioneer Press ran a story detailing allegations of massive academic fraud in the men 's basketball program . Former basketball office manager Jan <unk> had gone to the newspaper claiming she had written over 400 papers for at least 20 Gopher men 's basketball players over a period of several years , ending in 1998 . When the Gophers played Gonzaga on March 11 , the University suspended players Antoine <unk> , Kevin Clark , Jason Stanford , and Miles Tarver since they allegedly had papers written for them by <unk> in previous seasons . With their roster depleted , the Gophers lost to Gonzaga , the season came to an end , and an internal investigation at the University began . 
 By June 1999 and in the midst of their investigation , the university had negotiated a buyout of the remainder of Haskins ' contract , worth $ 1 @.@ 5 million over three years . It also withdrew from postseason consideration in the 1999 @-@ 2000 season and docked itself 11 scholarships over four years . In the summer of 2000 , Haskins came forward and admitted that he had paid <unk> $ 3 @,@ 000 for her services ; this revelation came to light after Haskins turned his financial records over to the NCAA . In addition , more details were emerging in which Haskins was also accused of mail fraud in an incident regarding a recruit 's transcript , giving players cash , dismissing sexual harassment concerns against his players , as well as his staff trying to persuade professors to give his players inflated grades they had not earned . 
 After the details of Haskins ' ever @-@ growing involvement became more clear , the University initiated legal action to recover the buyout money . A judge ultimately ruled that Haskins must return just over half of the original $ 1 @.@ 5 million buyout . 
 During this time an NCAA investigation was also underway . Ultimately , it revealed that Minnesota was guilty of massive violations under Haskins ' watch . The NCAA stripped the Gophers of all postseason awards , titles , personal records , and statistics dating back to the 1993 – 94 season citing a " lack of institutional control . " Haskins was also slapped with a seven @-@ year " show @-@ cause " order , which effectively banned him from coaching at any level in the NCAA until 2007 . Besides lying about the $ 3 @,@ 000 payment , he had also told several of his players to lie to the NCAA . Later , the Big Ten forced the Gophers to vacate their 1997 conference title , as well as all regular season games dating to 1993 – 94 . As a result , Minnesota 's official record from 1993 – 94 to 1998 – 99 is 0 – 0 . If not for the vacated games , Haskins would be the second @-@ winningest coach in school history . 
 In addition , the NCAA docked the Gophers an additional five scholarships over the following three seasons , and also imposed recruiting limitations and department @-@ wide probation lasting four years . 
 In addition to Haskins , Athletic Director Mark <unk> , Vice President for Athletics , Student Development McKinley Boston , Associate Athletics Director Jeff <unk> and academic counselor Alonzo Newby also resigned . The University also agreed to return 90 % ( approximately $ 350 @,@ 000 ) of the profits earned by the basketball program during their appearances in the NCAA tournament , including the 1997 Final Four run . 
 = = = The Monson era ( 1999 – 2006 ) = = = 
 Following Haskins ' departure , the University hired Gonzaga 's Dan Monson to be their next head coach , who coincidentally had just beaten the Gophers in the NCAA Tournament the previous March . Monson was the coach for part of eight seasons . However , during his tenure the scholarship reductions took their full effect , making it difficult for him to recruit on the same level as the rest of the Big Ten . His Gopher teams only made the NCAA tournament once , in 2004 @-@ 05 . Monson almost left the Minnesota program for the University of Washington following the 2001 – 02 season , but was thought of highly by the athletics department under Tom Moe and was persuaded to stay despite limited success . These trends did not reverse after he remained at the program . 
 During his final full season the Gophers were 5 – 11 in Big Ten play , and after a 2 – 5 start to open the 2006 – 07 season , Monson and Athletics Director Joel Maturi announced Monson 's resignation on November 30 , 2006 . Despite Monson 's inability to field a consistent winner , he was lauded by University officials for bringing integrity and cleanliness back to the program . Assistant coach Jim Molinari was named head coach on an interim basis and , after a 3 – 13 Big Ten record to finish the season , was not retained as head coach . Maturi began an extensive search for a new permanent head coach at season 's end . 
 = = = The Tubby era ( 2007 – 2013 ) = = = 
 On March 23 , 2007 , Maturi made a move that surprised many when he hired Tubby Smith after he resigned from the University of Kentucky to be the next head Gopher basketball coach . Smith 's name recognition and winning reputation gave the program a new optimism , something it badly needed to counter its dwindling fan interest . 
 Smith 's coaching had an immediate impact on the previously unsuccessful Gophers squad . The team went from 8 – 22 in 2006 – 07 to 20 – 13 in 2007 – 08 . Smith also led the Golden Gophers to the Big Ten Tournament semi @-@ finals after defeating 2nd seeded Indiana . Coach Smith also signed a top 25 recruiting class , the best in years for the program . Smith returned Minnesota to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2005 in the 2008 @-@ 09 season . Smith 's team struggled throughout the 2009 @-@ 10 season with off @-@ court issues , but advanced to the championship game in the Big Ten Tournament for the first time in school history ( losing to regular season co @-@ champion Ohio State ) and made the NCAA tournament for the second consecutive season . 
 On March 25 , 2013 , Smith was relieved of his coaching duties at Minnesota .

 On April 3 , 2013 , Richard Pitino , son of Louisville coach Rick Pitino , verbally agreed to coach the Golden Gophers . On April 3 , after missing out on the NCAA tournament , the Gophers responded by winning the 2014 NIT championship trophy by defeating SMU . As a result , Pitino claimed his first championship with the team . Following the success of an NIT championship , the Gophers hoped to qualify for the NCAA tournament the following year . However , the team struggled and finished with only six wins in the conference and did not qualify for any major tournament . The 2016 season was a disaster for the Gophers as they only managed to win two conference games . The lone bright spot came during a late season upset against ranked Maryland to give the Gophers their first conference win on the season . Despite the lack of success on the court , the Gophers were able to get Amir Coffey , a highly ranked player from Hopkins to commit to the men 's basketball program .

 The Gophers enjoyed fairly regular post season appearances under former coach Clem Haskins , making the post season in 10 of his 13 seasons as coach ( 6 NCAA tournament , 4 NIT ) , including all of his last 8 seasons . The team advanced to one Final 4 , one Elite 8 , one Sweet 16 , one second round appearance , and suffered two first round losses . However , after the academic fraud scandal in 1999 , the last 6 years of post season records were wiped out . So officially , the Gophers made 2 NCAA Tournament and 2 NIT appearances in the 13 years Haskins was coach . They advanced to the Elite 8 in 1990 , the Sweet 16 in 1989 , and were NIT champions in 1993 . 
 The Gophers saw some moderate success in the early 1980s , appearing in the 1980 , 1981 , and 1983 <unk> and the 1982 NCAA Tournament , where they advanced to the Sweet 16 . 
 Multiple problems plagued the Gophers during the 1976 – 1977 season , Jim Dutcher 's 2nd as head coach . Heading into the season the team knew they would not be eligible for the post season because of sanctions from the Bill Musselman era . Even so , this turned out to be one of the best teams in Gopher history , with the team finishing at 24 – 3 . But if not being post @-@ season eligible was not punishment enough , it was later found out that Mychal Thompson had sold two complimentary tickets to Gopher home games . When it was discovered , the profits were donated to University of Minnesota scholarship funds . The school and several prominent supporters , including Senator Wendell Anderson attempted to back Thompson and the team . Nevertheless , when the NCAA discovered Thompson 's act , Minnesota 's record for the season was forfeited and the accomplishments of that season are considered unofficial and not included in NCAA records .

 When the Gophers first organized , they played games in the on campus YMCA . In 1896 , the team moved into the campus Armory , a large building with gymnasium space for the team to use , even if basketball was not its primary purpose . They remained in the Armory for almost thirty years . Halfway through the 1924 – 25 season , coach Harold Taylor moved the team from the University Armory to the Kenwood Armory in downtown Minneapolis . This significantly increased the attendance ; capacity at the University Armory was 2 @,@ 000 , and it was 6 @,@ 500 at Kenwood . The team only played at Kenwood for a few seasons , however , as the University of Minnesota Field House — later known as Williams Arena — opened partway through the 1927 – 1928 season . The team moved in on January 31 , 1928 . 
 The Field House increased attendance capacity further , to 9 @,@ 500 . It was named after Henry L. Williams , the former Minnesota Golden Gophers football coach in 1950 , and was named after him when it was remodeled and expanded in 1950 , bringing the arena to a capacity of 18 @,@ 025 , which was the largest in the country for twenty years and significantly larger than the capacity of Williams Arena today . Gophers fans refer to Williams Arena as the Barn . Consequently , the student section is known as The Barn . Williams Arena was remodeled in 1993 again , to create a new facility for the women 's team to use . The team continues to play there to this day , making it one of the longest used arenas of any college basketball team and the oldest arena in the Big 10 . Williams Arena is also one of the few remaining arenas with a raised court , in which players have to go up stairs to reach the playing surface . 
 = = Rivals = = 
 In the early years of the program , the Gophers had several rivalries that have not extended into the modern era . Among them was a rivalry with Hamline University , now a Division III school in St. Paul . Hamline had one of the earliest college basketball programs in the country and it was several years before Minnesota competed on equal footing with them ; they played as late as 1935 . The greatest rival of the early years of the program was the Minnesota Aggies , representing the Minnesota School of Agriculture and Mining , which has since been incorporated into the University of Minnesota Twin Cities as the St. Paul campus . Minnesota A & M dominated the Gophers , winning ten consecutive games ; Minnesota did not get its first win against the Aggies until 1899 . This rivalry expired especially early , and the two teams did not meet after 1901 . The University of Minnesota is currently the only Division I basketball school in the state of Minnesota , so there are no intense intra @-@ border rivalries as there are in most states . 
 The Gophers were also an active participant in the early rivalry between Eastern schools and Midwestern schools for basketball preeminence . Minnesota broke up a stretch of Ivy League dominance from 1901 to 1906 with their successful 1902 season . The Eastern teams - Yale , Columbia , and Dartmouth were early powers - played with a more physical approach , while Midwestern teams used a different method . Wisconsin coach Walter Meanwell used the motion offense and " stress [ ed ] finesse . " W.C. Hyatt , who played for Yale , claimed that " The Minnesota and Wisconsin men played in the style prevalent among most of the girl colleges in the East , that is , the ' no contact ' game . " 
 In the modern era of the program , as is the case with most Big Ten sports , Minnesota 's primary rivals are the Iowa Hawkeyes and Wisconsin Badgers . In recent years , the rivalry with Wisconsin has become more intense than that with Iowa , primarily due to Wisconsin 's recent successes on the court . Minnesota and Wisconsin 's games together count towards the Border Battle , an annual trophy given to the points winner of several sports played between the two schools throughout the year . 
 The Gophers also have a less heralded rivalry with Ohio State . The two teams have very little history together , outside of the 1972 brawl between the teams at Williams Arena . That incident still lingers in the hearts of many long @-@ time Buckeye fans .

 Clarke MacArthur ( born April 6 , 1985 ) is a Canadian professional ice hockey left winger currently playing for the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . MacArthur has previously played in the NHL with the Buffalo Sabres , Atlanta Thrashers and Toronto Maple Leafs . He was originally selected by Buffalo in the third round , 74th overall , at the 2003 NHL Entry Draft . 
 Prior to turning professional , MacArthur spent three seasons playing for the Medicine Hat Tigers in the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) . While playing major junior hockey , he was named to the 2004 Memorial Cup All @-@ Star and 2005 WHL Eastern Conference All @-@ Star Teams .

 MacArthur played minor hockey in his hometown of Lloydminster , Alberta . He went unselected in the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) Bantam Draft when he was eligible , due in part to his short stature . While playing bantam hockey in Alberta , MacArthur put up impressive statistics , despite standing only 5 ' 4 " . He recorded 99 points in 38 games during the 2000 – 01 season with the Strathcona Warriors . After the season , he was named his club 's most valuable player . 
 With the numbers MacArthur put up in bantam hockey , he was able to secure a tryout with the Medicine Hat Tigers , but was the club 's final cut heading into the 2001 – 02 season . As a result , MacArthur played in the Alberta Junior Hockey League ( AJHL ) for the Drayton Valley Thunder . In his only season in the AJHL , MacArthur recorded 62 points in 62 games , and helped the Thunder capture a League championship . During the season , he grew seven inches and Medicine Hat was again interested in obtaining his services . He subsequently joined the club for the 2002 – 03 season , putting up 75 points in 70 games as a rookie . During the summer , MacArthur was then drafted by the Buffalo Sabres in the third round , 75th overall , of the 2003 NHL Entry Draft . 
 During his sophomore season in the WHL , 2003 – 04 , MacArthur helped lead the Tigers to the Ed Chynoweth Cup as League champions and a berth in the 2004 Memorial Cup . MacArthur was the fourth @-@ leading scorer in the tournament with one goal and four assists and was named to the Memorial Cup All @-@ Star Team . The Tigers , however , lost in the semifinal of the tournament to the Kelowna Rockets . MacArthur played in 58 games during the 2004 – 05 season with the Tigers and recorded 74 points , while serving as one of the club 's alternate captains . After the season , he was named to the WHL 's Eastern Conference First All @-@ Star Team . MacArthur was remarkably consistent during his WHL career , scoring 75 , 75 and 74 points in his three WHL seasons .

 MacArthur began his professional career with the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League ( AHL ) , the Buffalo Sabres ' top minor league affiliate , for the team 's ruin in the 2005 playoffs , appearing in three games and recording an assist for his first professional point . He remained with Rochester in 2005 – 06 , recording 53 points over 69 games in his first full professional season . 
 After starting the 2006 – 07 season in Rochester for a second year , MacArthur made his NHL debut for Buffalo on December 19 , 2006 , against the Montreal Canadiens . He split time between the Americans and Sabres for the rest of the season , finishing with 63 points over 51 games in the AHL and seven points over 19 games in the NHL . He recorded his first NHL point , an assist , on February 20 , 2007 , against the Philadelphia Flyers and scored his first career goal against the Ottawa Senators on February 22 . 
 During the 2007 – 08 season , MacArthur again spent time with the Americans and Sabres . At the NHL level , he scored eight goals and added seven assists in 37 games , while recording 42 points in 43 games with the Americans . After the season , MacArthur became a restricted free agent before re @-@ signing to a one @-@ year deal with the Sabres . 
 MacArthur spent his first full season at the NHL level in 2008 – 09 , playing in 71 games with the Sabres and recording 31 points . After the season , the Sabres tendered MacArthur a qualifying offer to retain his rights ; he subsequently signed a two @-@ year deal with the club in July 2009 . MacArthur played in 60 games for the Sabres , scoring 13 goals and adding 13 assists , before being traded to the Atlanta Thrashers in exchange for two draft picks at the NHL trade deadline . He finished the season with the Thrashers recording nine points in 21 games . 
 After the 2009 – 10 season , MacArthur filed for salary arbitration . After the hearing , he was awarded a one @-@ year contract worth $ 2 @.@ 4 million , a significant raise over his previous salary of $ 1 @.@ 4 million . The Thrashers chose not to accept the arbitration award , however , and MacArthur subsequently became an unrestricted free agent . 
 MacArthur signed a one @-@ year deal for $ 1 @.@ 1 million with the Toronto Maple Leafs on August 28 , 2010 , ahead of the 2010 – 11 season . When asked later about his decision to sign in Toronto , MacArthur said , " It was nice to come back to a hockey community . " He later added , " It 's the most fun I 've had since junior . " Maple Leafs captain Dion Phaneuf , one of MacArthur 's teammates at the 2005 World Junior Championships , was influential in the decision to sign with Toronto . MacArthur scored goals in each of his first four games with the club , becoming the first player in team history to do so . On November 16 , he tied a club record by recording three assists in a period against the Nashville Predators . The following month , he tied his personal career @-@ best when he scored two goals against the Pittsburgh Penguins on October 13 . At the end of his first season with the Maple Leafs , he signed a two @-@ year contract extension at $ 3 @.@ 25 million per annum on July 5 , 2011 , thereby avoiding salary arbitration with the club . 
 On July 5 , 2013 , after his contract had expired with the Maple Leafs , MacArthur signed a two @-@ year , $ 6 @.@ 5 million deal with Toronto 's Ontario rivals , the Ottawa Senators . On August 19 , 2014 , the Senators announced they had given signed MacArthur to a five @-@ year contract extension worth a total of $ 23 @.@ 25 million — carrying a $ 4 @.@ 65 million annual average value — set to start in the 2015 – 16 season . 
 On February 16 , 2015 , MacArthur collided with goalie Robin Lehner , resulting in both players being diagnosed with concussions . On October 20 , 2015 , Senators general manager Brian Murray announced that MacArthur suffered another concussion during a game against the Columbus Blue Jackets on October 14 and that MacArthur would not be playing in the near future . MacArthur would play only the first four games of the 2015 @-@ 16 season due to his concussion , although he passed a " baseline test " and was announced to be " medically cleared to play " in late March 2016 .

 American Life is the ninth studio album by American singer @-@ songwriter Madonna . It was first released on April 21 , 2003 , by Maverick Records and Warner Bros. Records . The album , produced in its entirety by Madonna and Mirwais Ahmadzaï , features references to many parts of American culture . The album is a concept album , with recurring themes of the American Dream and materialism . These themes reject the reputation Madonna held in the 1980s , earned by songs such as her worldwide hit " Material Girl " ( 1985 ) . The album contains rock , folk and electronica music , as well as influences of acoustic music on many tracks . 
 American Life received mixed reviews from music critics , with responses noting its consistency , but general responses called the record " about Madonna " and found it confusing . The album peaked at number one in fourteen countries . The Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) both certified it platinum in recognition of one million shipments in the United States , and 300 @,@ 000 shipments in the United Kingdom , respectively . The album became the 32nd @-@ best @-@ selling album of 2003 and has sold five million copies to date . American Life garnered two nominations at the 46th Grammy Awards in 2004 . 
 Four singles were released from the album . The first , the title track , was released to a generally negative critical reception , with Blender naming it the ninth worst song of all time . It charted at number 37 in the US while it entered the top ten in most countries , peaking at number two in the United Kingdom . A controversial music video was pulled after scenes of war and violence were criticized which led to an edited version being released . Its following single , " Hollywood " , became her first single not to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 since 1983 . " Nothing Fails " and " Love Profusion " , the third and fourth singles respectively , featured a lack of promotion resulting in a poor commercial performance . Despite it , both peaked at number one in Spain . 
 Madonna promoted the album during a small promotional tour for the album in April and May 2003 . At the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards , she performed alongside Britney Spears , Christina Aguilera and Missy Elliott a medley of " Like a Virgin " and " Hollywood " and engaged in open @-@ mouth kissing with Aguilera and Spears gaining great controversy and publicity . American Life was supported by Madonna 's sixth concert tour , the Re @-@ Invention World Tour , which was the highest grossing tour of 2004 earning $ 125 million . The tour was chronicled in a documentary titled I 'm Going to Tell You a Secret , which led to Madonna 's first live album of the same name . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 During the early 1990s , Madonna had focused on a number of provocative releases , like the erotic pictorial Sex book , the sadomasochist inspired album Erotica , and the erotic thriller , Body of Evidence , all of which she deduced was due to " a lot of rage and anger " within herself " . However , by the beginning of the new millennium , Madonna was living a calmer , more introspective and wholesome life with her husband Guy Ritchie and their children Lourdes and Rocco . According to biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli , the presence of Ritchie in Madonna 's life had a calming effect on the singer , making her more matured and easing her temper . Concentrating on her music career , Madonna was busy throughout of 2001 on her Drowned World Tour . On September 11 , 2001 , suicide bombers hijacked two jet airliners and crashed into the World Trade Center , resulting in the death of nearly 3 @,@ 000 people . The event had a profound effect on American society , with the cultural mood being bleak and paranoia . People , including Madonna , started asking questions about their culture and the American Dream , which had been a long @-@ lasting ideal for many . When Madonna started working on her ninth studio album , American Life , she wanted answers to her queries and an appropriate response to the 9 / 11 disaster and the ensuing Iraq war of 2003 . She believed that the ensuing months with the war would lead to a politically charged atmosphere throughout the country , and wanted to express that in the record . 
 Like her 2000 studio album , Music , Madonna enlisted the help of French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï . Always interested in adapting herself and her music to the contemporary compositions , Madonna was inspired by the new Massive Attack and Lemon Jelly albums . " We set out to put the two worlds of acoustic and electronic music together , " said Madonna . " It is another step on , but I 've never wanted to repeat myself . I don 't ever want to repeat myself or make the same record twice . " American Life became Madonna 's final studio album with Maverick Records , and marked the end of an eleven @-@ year recording history with the label . In an interview with VH1 titled Madonna Speaks , the singer discussed her 20 years in the music industry , and revealed her motivations behind American Life , about " material things " being unimportant . " I have lots of ' material ' things and I 've had lots of beliefs about things and what 's important , and I look back at the 20 years behind me and I realized that a lot of things that I 'd valued weren 't important " , she concluded . Discussing her thoughts on the conception of the album , she told Q magazine that through her 20 years of being in the entertainment industry , she would have a correct opinion on fame and fortune and its perils , which would be the base of the album . 
 = = Writing and inspiration = = 
 When Madonna started writing the songs on the album , she was inspired by different situations , like having guitar lessons and getting an idea , or sometimes Ahmadzaï would send over a rough demo to her without the basic chord progression . The songs on American Life and their lyrics were developed like that . Explaining her writing process , Madonna told Q magazine that the " The music has to jar my brain in terms of lyrics . Sometimes I write free verse . I have a journal and I note down ideas I get from newspapers and books " . Madonna also remembered Ahmadzaï 's downbeat existentialism regarding the condition of society around them , and the long discussions they had into the night , which ultimately reflected into the songwriting as anxiety they felt in their heart . American Life was deemed by some as a concept album featuring political themes based around the United States , with Madonna explaining that she felt " like America has changed over the years and that a lot of our values seem to be materially oriented and so superficial . And we all seem to be obsessed with fame just for the sake of fame , no matter what — sell your soul to the devil if that 's what it takes . And we 're also completely obsessed with the way we look . " Madonna recalled that even she had been through such trials and those musings came out in the writing of the first three songs , the title track , " Hollywood " and " I 'm So Stupid " . John Norris from MTV described them as a trilogy , and an indicator of Madonna 's reassessment of her life while discussing things she wishes to put behind her . Madonna partly agreed , saying that the tracks are extensions of one another , and portray her desire of giving importance to less noteworthy things , and how she could come out of that " illusion " . Madonna discussed the materialistic themes of the record and her personal encounters which have led to the composition with MTV saying : 
 " Who better to say those things don 't matter than somebody who 's experienced them ? [ People may say ] , ' How can you say they don 't matter ? How can you say that money won 't bring you happiness if you don 't have a lot of money ? How can you say that fame and fortune are not a guarantee for happiness and joy and fulfillment in your life ? ' You have to have that experience to know . ' Cause you have all those things , I 've had all those things , and I 've had nothing but chaos around me . So I 'm just sharing what I know with the world . ' Cause I do think that we 've become completely consumed with being rich and famous , our society has . And I just want to tell people , take it from me , I have all those things and none of them ever brought me one minute of happiness . " 
 The glamorous world of Hollywood also reflected in her writing , especially in the second track of the same name . Describing it as a metaphor , Madonna said that " in Hollywood you can lose your memory and your vision of the future . You can lose everything because you can lose yourself . " The beginning of the album cleared away what was not important for her , so Madonna could concentrate on the things that did matter . So , in contrast to the first three tracks , the later songs on American Life also deal with issues close to the singer 's heart , like talking about her relationship with her parents on the track " Mother and Father " . When Madonna was five , her mother died of breast cancer and the track was " a way of letting go of the sadness and moving on . " According to Lucy O 'Brien , author of Madonna : Like an Icon , another concept of American Life was about " nothingness " . This was evident in the titles of the songs like " Nobody Knows Me " , usage of " no " in " Love Profusion " , as well as " Nothing Fails " . Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people 's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love . But " Nothing Fails " , along with tracks " Intervention " and " X @-@ Static Process , " became the centerpiece of the album as a triptych of love songs for Ritchie . Beginning as a humble track that musician @-@ producer Guy Sigsworth wrote for his wife , " Nothing Fails " also has lyrics by singer Jem Archer , who was asked to collaborate with Sigsworth and Madonna during the first collaborative sessions of American Life . The track is followed by the folk @-@ inspired " Intervention " and " X @-@ Static Process , " both being reflective and emotional . Her reflective mood continued with the last track " Easy Ride , " which was inspired by the imagery of a full @-@ circle and symbolized life for the singer . 
 = = Recording and mixing = = 
 The album was mostly composed and entirely produced by Madonna and Ahmadzaï . Both had previously collaborated on Madonna 's studio album Music ( 2000 ) . The recording sessions for American Life started at late 2001 , then was put on hold as Madonna filmed Swept Away in Malta and starred in the West End play Up for Grabs . She returned to the Olympic Recording Studios and Sarm West Studios in late 2002 and finished off the sessions in London and Los Angeles in early 2003 . For the instrumentation featured in some of the song , Ahmadzaï played the guitars , and Stuart Price played the piano . Tom Hannen and Simon Changer , both of them worked as assistant engineer during the recording . 
 Unlike Music , Madonna had enlisted Ahmadzaï also as a songwriter on American Life hence what transpired was Madonna 's wholesale adaptation of the producers style and sound . He explained that there are some influences from his work , but Madonna mostly wanted a minimalist structure for the album . This was beneficial for him since he did not like working with a lot of people , and hence it became a close collaboration . Since electronic music was already popular , Ahmadzaï felt that it was necessary to go back to its underground roots and focus on the songwriting , rather than the technical aspects of recording and mixing . Describing it as modified songwriting , he said that although the concept " might sound simple at first , even rough . But when you pay attention , there is a lot of technology underneath " . This approach was an imperative for American Life . Recorded at three different studios using Ahmadzaï 's own gear along with the studio 's SSL mixing consoles , the album 's recording process was often laborious but was sparse in the musical arrangements of the songs . About the musical composition , Ahmadzaï told to Remix magazine that they " tried to under @-@ produce many tracks to make them sound rougher than the average international pop production . We wanted to do something totally modern and futuristic but not very apparent . You have to be very minimalist and choose every sound very carefully . Some tracks were composed in the big studio ; that can be very dangerous because you can lose perspective . But all initial directions of the tracks were made in my home studio . " 
 American Life is suffused with Ahmadzaï 's characteristic production techniques , like stuttering instruments and vocals , oscillating loop tones recalling 1950s Sonar pulses , morphing vocals consisting of grunts and squeals and treatments that make the music freeze in between rhythms . The producer hoped that using stuttering would become a rage in the future world of recording . He believed that people think it is not natural to skip and stutter the music . But he used it to create a new groove . With the help of Pro Tools , he froze the audio at any point he wanted to change the rhythm of the tracks . Madonna discussed the recording of the title track stating that Ahmadzaï had encouraged her to rap spontaneously , about all the materialistic objects that she herself had been using and doing . They had an instrumental breakdown in " American Life " , where the producer encouraged Madonna to add a rap about her everyday life . " Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio , and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio , I was just like , ' OK , let me just talk about the things that I like ' . So I went and it was just total improv [ sic ] and obviously it was sloppy at first , but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it . So it was totally spontaneous , " she added . 
 For " Hollywood " , he used a drum kit and percussion from an E @-@ mu Emulator and also added extra drum sounds to give the song an old , disco vibe . Wanting to have a loud bass synth sound , , Ahmadzaï used a Nord Lead synthesizer with lot of filtering manipulations . But he faced problems with it , so he used a Yamaha <unk> mixer . He did not want " Hollywood " to sound like the music being played at the nightclubs , so he recorded Madonna 's vocals with heavy compression in her headphones . Two machines were used for the vocal editing in " Hollywood " . Madonna preferred the Antares Auto @-@ Tune plug in , while Ahmadzaï chose an AMS pitch shifter . Madonna wanted Auto @-@ Tune because she wanted " Hollywood " to have a more dance @-@ like feel to it , although Ahmadzaï was against it . The track " I 'm So Stupid " had gentle vocals , then the singing was frozen using a Roland VP @-@ 9000 . When Madonna sings " <unk> " , the vocals freeze and the process sounds natural , but in reality is not . When it came to adding the beats , he experimented by programming the drums in Logic Pro and changing the timing of the beats . The producer combines different samples of songs from his own collections and keeps on trying until something new is developed . The mixing for the tracks was done by Mark " Spike " Stent at the Westlake Recording Studios at West Hollywood , California , while Tim Young did the mastering of the songs at Metropolis Studios in London . Michael Colombier did the string arrangement with Geoff Foster acting as the strings engineer , conducting at AIR Studios . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Slant Magazine 's Sal Cinquemani stated that " Madonna couldn 't possibly have intended to make a pop album . American Life is a folk album in the purest definition of the term — and it 's reflected right in the title . " Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune called the record an " electro @-@ folk album " with electronic beats and synthetic burps . " American Life " , the title track , is the first song on the record . Starting with Madonna 's multi @-@ tracked voice questioning , " Am I gonna be a star " , " should I change my name " , the lyrics then develop into what Rikky Rooksby of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna states as a complaint about modern @-@ day life . The lyrics accompany a " punchy octave synth figure " synchronized with a drum and bass beat . After three minutes of the song , Madonna performs a rap naming the people who were working for her . The second track and single " Hollywood " is introduced with sounds of tweeting birds , before an acoustic guitar starts with a four chord sequence that has been compared to songs by the band Red Hot Chili Peppers . The texture grows with addition of drums and synths , until after a minute the instrumental is pulled out , leaving just Madonna 's vocals and the acoustic guitar accompaniment . During the final sequence , Madonna raps , as is featured in the first song , with the repeated phrase " Push the button " . Lyrically , like the first track , it discusses American culture and greed focusing on Hollywood , California , as a place of stars and illusory dreams . 
 The next track " I 'm So Stupid " features an introduction with a two @-@ chord electric guitar which leads to a minor drum beat , with the guitar later changing to a three @-@ chord . The composition throughout is generally minor , but at the 2 : 15 mark , different pitched synths change manically , and towards the end the synths become less prominent as the guitars become the main focus . Lyrically , the song expresses disillusionment with Madonna singing " I used to live in a fuzzy dream " and " It was just greed " , also proclaiming that once she was " stupider than stupid " before stating " Everybody 's stupid " towards the end of the song . The fourth track " Love Profusion " starts with another acoustic guitar introduction , with rhythm being produced by a bass drum with synth @-@ strings added later in the song . Vocally , the line " I got you under my skin " is repeated , while a male voice acts as the backing for the track as the final words , " feel good " , are performed with no backing instrumental . " Nobody Knows Me " is the fifth track , featuring vocoder treated vocals . The song is accompanied by bleeping synths and a heavy drum part . The title is repeated throughout the song as she references " social disease " which is also repeated . A recurring theme of American Life is the acoustic guitar introduction to the songs , and is yet again featured in the sixth track " Nothing Fails " . The guitar is accompanied by a " light " drum section and low @-@ pitched vocals from Madonna . The song also features a cello in the first part , and a church choir in the second part . Lyrically , the song discusses a lover who is the one , and how their meeting was not just chance . A reference to the " tree of life " is made during the song as Madonna states " I 'm not religious " but she wishes to pray . 
 Acoustic guitars introduces the seventh track , " Intervention " . It starts with a three chord minor sequence which changes to a four chord one during the chorus section and a bass section starts at the end of the track . Lyrically , the song is an optimistic track about how a relationship will last as Madonna says " the road looks lonely but that 's just Satan 's game " . " X @-@ Static Process " , the eighth track , starts once again with acoustic guitars and throughout there are vocal harmony lines in addition to an organ part . Lyrically , like the title track , it questions modern life as Madonna sings " Jesus Christ will you look at me , don 't know who I 'm supposed to be " . " Mother and Father " is the album 's ninth track , with a drum and bass beat paired with an electric guitar present in the instrumental . Lyrically , the song reflects on Madonna 's childhood including her mother 's death and her father 's reaction , and the effect on their relationship . The tenth track is " Die Another Day " , the theme to the James Bond film of the same name which featured dominating string and synth parts . The eleventh and final track on the album , " Easy Ride " , is a heavily string @-@ oriented song . It addresses Madonna 's feelings towards old age , wanting to live forever , and coming full circle to a point in her life where she could be comfortable . 
 = = Artwork and release = = 
 By 2003 , Madonna suggested that she was in a revolutionary mood , which led to journalistic discussions that another image makeover would take place for her . Still recovering from the commercial disappointment of Swept Away , Madonna changed her image completely to resemble that of a fighter , with inspirations from pictures of Argentinian guerrilla leader Che Guevara . French design team M / M Paris ( Michael <unk> and Mathias <unk> ) were responsible for the artwork of American Life . The duo are best known for their collaborations with musicians and Madonna hired the duo after discussing the concept for just six minutes . The photo shoot for the album was done by photographer Craig McDean in January 2003 at Los Angeles , and cost a reported $ 415 @,@ 000 . McDean had already worked with Madonna for the cover of Vanity Fair magazine in October 2002 ; this shoot had a military theme , with Madonna posing in dark green and black clothes , combat boots , and guns . 
 As with 1989 's album Like a Prayer , Madonna 's hair was dyed dark brown to signify " seriousness " , and on the cover of the album Madonna wore a beret while resurrecting the famous Guerrillero Heroico image of Guevara . In an interview with Veja magazine , she described Guevara as " an icon instantaneously identified with an revolution spirit . That goes for the whole album : the current moment , I feel a revolutionary state of mind " . Author Santiago Fouz @-@ Hernández wrote in his book , Madonna 's Drowned Worlds : New Approaches to Her <unk> Transformations , that the inclusion of Guevara as an inspiration for the cover was one of the many instances of Madonna incorporating Hispanic identity and the Latino subculture in her work . Because of the paramilitary theme , the dyed hair and the artistic composition , was compared with an infamous seventies photo of kidnapped newspaper heiress , Patty Hearst . The cover also had military styled stenciled lettering . The word " American Life " is written in blood red color and has a punk @-@ rock style . Inside the CD booklet , she wielded an Uzi submachine gun , her body in various martial art poses , spelling out her name . By late 2003 , she had wiped out the military image completely , and followed with another subtle toned @-@ down image of that of a writer and philanthropist . 
 In an interview with Larry King in October 2002 , she said that she wanted to give the album a Hebrew name . Madonna then considered Ein <unk> , which means endlessness , as a possible title for the album . However , as the months went on and the album became more of a meditation on the difficulty of leading a spiritual life in the glamour industry , the title was changed to Hollywood with Madonna saying that it was " a reflection of my state of mind and a view of the world right now " . Still , she was not satisfied with the name , and finalized on American Life . 
 American Life is Madonna 's second album to bear a " Parental Advisory " label after Erotica ( 1992 ) , due the profanity used in the title song . The album was released in the United States on April 22 , 2003 and eight months later , Warner Music France released a box set version containing both the album and the remix collection , Remixed & Revisited , in a cardboard sleeve entitled Édition <unk> <unk> : American Life + Remixed & Revisited . To counter illegal downloads of the album 's songs before and after the release , Madonna 's associates created a number of false MP3 files of similar length and size . Some of these files delivered a brief message from Madonna saying " What the fuck do you think you 're doing ? " followed by minutes of silence . Madonna 's website was hacked and the hacker added a message appearing on the main page , saying " This is what the fuck I think I 'm doing ... " followed by download links for each of the album 's songs . The <unk> website was closed after the attack for about 15 hours . Liz Rosenberg , Madonna 's spokesperson , told The Smoking Gun that the defacement was indeed a hack , and not a marketing ploy . The defacement was linked to <unk> , an online hacker magazine whose representatives clarified that they did not " have [ any ] link with this [ hacker ] guy in any way , and we don 't even know his identity . " The hacked page also contained a derogatory reference to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , the federal law aimed at cracking down on digital and online piracy . In addition , the defaced page included an impromptu marriage proposal to Morgan Webb , the host of a daily technology show called The Screen Savers .

 To start marketing the album , Madonna embarked on a promotional tour across the United States and Europe . One of these performances , presented at the Total Request Live studios in New York , was shown by MTV in a special named Madonna on Stage & on the Record . Hosted by Carson Daly , she sang songs from the album and answered questions from the audience . Madonna also performed at HMV store in Oxford , United Kingdom to 500 people . While in the United Kingdom , she performed " American Life " and " Hollywood " at BBC One 's Friday Night with Jonathan Ross and Top of the Pops . Another performance on Tower 's Fourth Street in Manhattan was presented to around 400 people . A stage was built in preparation for the performances with long dark drapes and large speakers , and according to Billboard was so that over one thousand fans nearby could hear the performance . She also performed a private concert in Paris , France , at restaurant Cantine du Faubourg to people who won tickets on a promotion hosted by NRJ Radio , and also some of her French friends including designer Jean @-@ Paul Gaultier , director Luc Besson and producer Ahmadzaï . 
 On August 27 , 2003 , Madonna opened the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards with American recording artists Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera , performing a medley of " Like a Virgin " and " Hollywood " . American rapper Missy Elliott also performed her song " Work It " halfway through the performance . After " Hollywood " was performed by Madonna , she engaged in kissing with both Spears and Aguilera becoming an infamous moment for all three acts and in television history . In 2003 , Madonna planned to release a special commemorative box set to celebrate her 20th anniversary in the music business and the release of her first studio album , Madonna , in 1983 . The plan for the box set was eventually cancelled and Remixed & Revisited was released in its place . The compilation contains remixed versions of four songs from American Life and a previously unreleased song called " Your Honesty " .

 Preceding the album release , " Die Another Day " was released as a single to promote the twentieth James Bond film of the same name . The song peaked at number eight in the United States , and number three in the United Kingdom . The production costs for the music video were over six million dollars , making it the second most expensive music video ever made , after " Scream " by Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson . " American Life " was released as the lead single from the album on April 8 , 2003 in the United States and on April 14 , 2003 in Europe . Blender magazine listed the song as the ninth worst song ever . There are two music videos . The first version is based on a fashion runway , with extra 's including Children dressed in provocative war inspired outfits . The scene descends into violence and fighting to which the audience find amusement . At the end of the music video , then @-@ President of the United States , George W. Bush is portrayed by a lookalike lighting a cigar . The anti @-@ war content of its music video was interpreted as being unpatriotic , making Madonna withdraw its release from American music channels . She also released a statement saying she did so because she believed it was not appropriate to air it at that time , and that she did not want to risk offending anyone who could misinterpret its meaning . A second video was produced , showing Madonna donning military clothing and singing in front of the various flags of the world . The song debuted at number ninety on the Billboard Hot 100 , and peaked at number thirty @-@ seven on the chart , becoming Madonna 's 45th Top 40 hit in the chart . The song also peaked at number two in the UK , seven in Austria and Australia , and ten in France and Germany . 
 The second single , " Hollywood " , released on July 3 , 2003 in Europe and July 8 , 2003 in the US , failed to chart in the Hot 100 , becoming Madonna 's first single in twenty years not to do so since " Burning Up " ( 1983 ) . The song was a top five hit in Canada , Italy and the United Kingdom . " Nothing Fails " was released in October 26 , 2003 as the third single . It was a minor chart success , but did not match the success of previous singles from American Life , charting outside the top twenty in some countries . It peaked in the top ten in Canada and Spain . In late 2003 , " Nothing Fails " was remixed as " Nothing Fails ( Nevins Mix ) " for Madonna 's remix EP Remixed & Revisited . The remix peaked at number seven in Italy . " Love Profusion " , was the fourth and final single from the album , released on December 8 , 2003 . It peaked in the top ten only in Greece , Italy and Canada , her fifth top ten Canadian hit from the album and thirteenth top ten in @-@ a @-@ row . Also , it debuted and peaked at eleven on UK Singles Chart , becoming Madonna sixth single , of eight , in lost the top ten on the chart , after " One More Chance " ( 1996 ) . The promotional releases , " Nobody Knows Me " and " Mother and Father " , became very successful in American clubs , peaking at number four and number nine , respectively , on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart . American Life became the first album to achieve seven top ten songs on this chart .

 In 2003 , Madonna collaborated with photographer Steven Klein for an art installation project called X @-@ Static Process . The installation portrayed Madonna in different incarnations of her spiritual practices – from yogi , prophet , queen to freak and pole dancer . The publication was a worldwide success , leading to a number of exhibitions in New York , London , Paris , Düsseldorf , Berlin and Florence . After the exhibition was over , Madonna was inspired by the images from the exhibitions and decided to incorporate them into her then unplanned tour and asked Klein to help her with the task . She then began developing her sixth concert tour called Re @-@ Invention World Tour . The poster released for the tour used one of the images from the installation project . It featured Madonna in a seventeenth @-@ century @-@ style dress , crawling on all fours towards the camera . The central theme of the show was unity versus violence . It was divided into five acts with different themes : French Baroque @-@ Marie Antionette Revival , Military @-@ Army , Circus @-@ Cabaret , Acoustic and Scottish @-@ Tribal segments . During the Q Awards , Elton John accused Madonna for lip @-@ synching in her shows which gained great controversy but was denied by Madonna 's representatives . Although musician Prince 's Musicology Live <unk> tour was initially projected to be the highest grossing tour of 2004 , Billboard Boxscore published that the Re @-@ Invention Tour had sold 55 out of the 56 shows and grossed $ 125 million . At the 2004 Billboard Touring Awards , Re @-@ Invention Tour received the Top Tour while Madonna 's tour manager Caresse Henry was awarded the Top Manager award . A documentary , titled I 'm Going to Tell You a Secret , which chronicled the tour , was released in 2005 . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 American Life received mixed reviews from music critics , holding a score of 60 / 100 on music review website Metacritic , based on 17 professional reviews . Billboard 's Michael Paoletta noted the lyrical differences from past albums such as Ray of Light positively , saying " American Life relies less on spiritual introspection and more on woman @-@ in @-@ the @-@ mirror confrontation . " Entertainment Weekly 's Ken Tucker generally responded well , saying that at its best , the album offers blunt , questing and decisive music but the weakest point was Madonna sounding like a girl who 's grown content with her husband and kids and the ability to hire help to do her bidding . Dimitri <unk> of Vibe magazine gave a positive review for American Life , saying that Madonna " stayed still " in the album , and commenting that " This may be the first time Madonna hasn 't pushed herself to explore new ground , but at least she 's chosen a good place to rest . " Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave the album a mixed review , stating that American Life is not a " masterpiece " compared to her 1992 studio album , Erotica . " It 's frequently self @-@ indulgent , misguided , unpleasant , difficult to listen to , silly and humorless , but it 's also consistent , uncompromising and unapologetic , " Cinquemani opined , ending with the deduction that American Life stood for the last time Madonna made music without the primary objective of making a hit . In an earlier review , Cinquemani concluded that after years between subgenres and finally finding a comfortable niche in electronica , now showing promise as a folk @-@ rock songstress , the only thing for Madonna to do is make a full @-@ blown rock album . 
 Giving the album three out of five stars , Ben Ratliff from Rolling Stone summarized that the messages on the album are dour , but complimented Madonna for talking about the then @-@ current situation of the nation . Johny Davis from NME gave the album a rating of seven out of ten , saying that technically the album sounds good , but overall it felt like an unnecessary sequel to Madonna 's previous endeavors like Ray of Light and Music . Allmusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that American Life is better for what it promises than what it delivers , and that it is better in theory than practice . Kelefa Sanneh from Blender awarded the album three stars out of five . " Just as disjointed as Music and much more severe ... Without a compelling back story , her songs seem diminished " . Dorian Lynskey from Q magazine also rated it three out of five , stating " ' Nothing Fails ' , the album 's centerpiece , is as good a showstopper as ' Live to Tell ' ... [ but ] it 's no wonder that a record about feeling confused ends up sounding confused " . 
 Jon Pareles from The New York Times felt that Madonna tried to be honest with the concept of American Dream in the album , but ended up producing songs akin to the " folkie psychobabble " of songwriters like Jewel . James Hannaham from Spin compared the album 's introspective themes to her previous albums Ray of Light and Music and also noted Madonna spends much of American Life bemoaning the emptiness of celebrity culture . Alexis Petridis of The Guardian responded well to parts of the record saying " American Life 's best tracks make a mockery of virtually all other current pop music " however his conclusive point in the review was that there was not enough of good songs . The Village Voice 's Jessica Winter called Madonna 's voice " redundant " and commented that " she <unk> ' the American dream ' only to pitch woo at her English husband and articulate a vague yet fiery frustration with her outrageously privileged station in the world " . Ed Howard from Stylus Magazine gave the album a negative review calling the album " about Madonna " instead of American culture explaining , " it 's Madonna who , surprisingly , has simply run out of things to say " . BBC 's Ian Young also gave a negative review , saying that " the tunes are bland and weak , the lyrics are uninspired and self @-@ absorbed and the semi @-@ Ibiza backing music is bare and recycled — and we are convinced that she has lost it . " 
 American Life also achieved award nominations . In 2004 , American Life was nominated at the 46th Grammy Awards in two categories " Best Short Form Music Video " and " Best Dance Recording " , both for the song " Die Another Day . " It was also nominated for " Best Video from a Film " at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards . At the Hungarian Music Awards of 2004 and 2005 , the album was nominated both times in the category of " International Pop Album of the Year " , but failed to win . Another nomination was for a similar category at the NRJ Music Awards of 2004 .

 After its release , American Life debuted at number one on the United States Billboard 200 chart with 241 @,@ 000 copies sold in its first week . The sales were less than Madonna 's previous studio album , Music , which debuted with 420 @,@ 000 copies in 2000 , but was the only one that week to sell over 200 @,@ 000 copies . It was Madonna 's second consecutive number one debut , and her fifth number one album overall in the US . The next week , sales dropped by 62 % to 91 @,@ 000 copies , and the album slid from the top of the chart to number eight . It continued to decrease in sales down the chart and fell off the Billboard 200 . In September 2003 , following Madonna 's performance at the MTV Video Music Awards , the album saw a sales gain of 19 % , but did not chart back . On July 7 , 2003 , just months after the release , it was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , signifying shipment of one million copies in the US alone .

 = Northern pintail = 
 The pintail or northern pintail ( Anas acuta ) is a duck with wide geographic distribution that breeds in the northern areas of Europe , Asia and North America . It is migratory and winters south of its breeding range to the equator . Unusually for a bird with such a large range , it has no geographical subspecies if the possibly conspecific duck Eaton 's pintail is considered to be a separate species . 
 This is a large duck , and the male 's long central tail feathers give rise to the species ' English and scientific names . Both sexes have blue @-@ grey bills and grey legs and feet . The drake is more striking , having a thin white stripe running from the back of its chocolate @-@ coloured head down its neck to its mostly white undercarriage . The drake also has attractive grey , brown , and black patterning on its back and sides . The hen 's plumage is more subtle and subdued , with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female dabbling ducks . Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute @-@ like whistle . 
 The northern pintail is a bird of open wetlands which nests on the ground , often some distance from water . It feeds by dabbling for plant food and adds small invertebrates to its diet during the nesting season . It is highly gregarious when not breeding , forming large mixed flocks with other species of duck . This duck 's population is affected by predators , parasites and avian diseases . Human activities , such as agriculture , hunting and fishing , have also had a significant impact on numbers . Nevertheless , owed to the huge range and large population of this species , it is not threatened globally . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 This species was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae in 1758 as Anas acuta . The scientific name comes from two Latin words : <unk> , meaning " duck " , and acuta , which comes from the verb <unk> , " to sharpen " ; the species term , like the English name , refers to the pointed tail of the male in breeding plumage . Within the large dabbling duck genus Anas , the northern pintail 's closest relatives are other pintails , such as the yellow @-@ billed pintail ( A. <unk> ) and Eaton 's pintail ( A. eatoni ) . The pintails are sometimes separated in the genus Dafila ( described by Stephens , 1824 ) , an arrangement supported by morphological , molecular and behavioural data . The famous British ornithologist Sir Peter Scott gave this name to his daughter , the artist Dafila Scott . 
 Eaton 's pintail has two subspecies , A. e. eatoni ( the Kerguelen pintail ) of Kerguelen Islands , and A. e. <unk> ( the Crozet pintail ) of Crozet Islands , and was formerly considered conspecific with the northern hemisphere 's northern pintail . Sexual dimorphism is much less marked in the southern pintails , with the male 's breeding appearance being similar to the female plumage . Unusually for a species with such a large range , northern pintail has no geographical subspecies if Eaton 's pintail is treated as a separate species . A claimed extinct subspecies from <unk> Island , Tristram 's pintail , A. a. <unk> , appears to be indistinguishable from the nominate form . 
 = = Description = = 
 The northern pintail is a fairly large duck with a wing chord of 23 @.@ 6 – 28 @.@ 2 cm ( 9 @.@ 3 – 11 @.@ 1 in ) and wingspan of 80 – 95 cm ( 31 – 37 in ) . The male is 59 – 76 cm ( 23 – 30 in ) in length and weighs 450 – 1 @,@ 360 g ( 0 @.@ 99 – 3 @.@ 00 lb ) , and therefore is considerably larger than the female , which is 51 – 64 cm ( 20 – 25 in ) long and weighs 454 – 1 @,@ 135 g ( 1 @.@ 001 – 2 @.@ 502 lb ) . The northern pintail broadly overlaps in size with the similarly @-@ widespread mallard , but is more slender , elongated and gracile , with a relatively longer neck and ( in males ) a longer tail . The unmistakable breeding plumaged male has a chocolate @-@ brown head and white breast with a white stripe extending up the side of the neck . Its upperparts and sides are grey , but elongated grey feathers with black central stripes are draped across the back from the shoulder area . The vent area is yellow , contrasting with the black underside of the tail , which has the central feathers elongated to as much as 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) . The bill is bluish and the legs are blue @-@ grey . 
 The adult female is mainly scalloped and mottled in light brown with a more uniformly grey @-@ brown head , and its pointed tail is shorter than the male 's ; it is still easily identified by its shape , long neck , and long grey bill . In non @-@ breeding ( eclipse ) plumage , the drake pintail looks similar to the female , but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers . Juvenile birds resemble the female , but are less neatly scalloped and have a duller brown speculum with a narrower trailing edge . 
 The pintail walks well on land , and swims well . It has a very fast flight , with its wings slightly swept @-@ back , rather than straight out from the body like other ducks . In flight , the male shows a black speculum bordered white at the rear and pale rufous at the front , whereas the female 's speculum is dark brown bordered with white , narrowly at the front edge but very prominently at the rear , being visible at a distance of 1 @,@ 600 m ( 0 @.@ 99 mi ) . 
 The male 's call is a soft <unk> @-@ <unk> whistle , similar to that of the common teal , whereas the female has a mallard @-@ like descending quack , and a low croak when flushed . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 This dabbling duck breeds across northern areas of Eurasia south to about Poland and Mongolia , and in Canada , Alaska and the Midwestern United States . It winters mainly south of its breeding range , reaching almost to the equator in Panama , northern sub @-@ Saharan Africa and tropical South Asia . Small numbers migrate to Pacific islands , particularly Hawaii , where a few hundred birds winter on the main islands in shallow wetlands and flooded agricultural habitats . <unk> journeys also occur : a bird that was caught and ringed in Labrador , Canada , was shot by a hunter in England nine days later , and Japanese @-@ ringed birds have been recovered from six US states east to Utah and Mississippi . In parts of the range , such as Great Britain and the northwestern United States , the pintail may be present all year . 
 The northern pintail 's breeding habitat is open <unk> wetlands , such as wet grassland , <unk> or tundra . In winter , it will utilise a wider range of open habitats , such as sheltered estuaries , brackish marshes and coastal lagoons . It is highly gregarious outside the breeding season and forms very large mixed flocks with other ducks . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Both sexes reach sexual maturity at one year of age . The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised , continually whistling . If there is a group of males , they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left . The female prepares for copulation , which takes place in the water , by lowering her body ; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female , taking the feathers on the back of her head in his mouth . After mating , he raises his head and back and whistles . 
 Breeding takes place between April and June , with the nest being constructed on the ground and hidden amongst vegetation in a dry location , often some distance from water . It is a shallow scrape on the ground lined with plant material and down . The female lays seven to nine cream @-@ coloured eggs at the rate of one per day ; the eggs are 55 mm × 38 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in × 1 @.@ 5 in ) in size and weigh 45 g ( 1 @.@ 6 oz ) , of which 7 % is shell . If predators destroy the first clutch , the female can produce a replacement clutch as late as the end of July . The hen alone incubates the eggs for 22 to 24 days before they hatch . The precocial downy chicks are then led by the female to the nearest body of water , where they feed on dead insects on the water surface . The chicks fledge in 46 to 47 days after hatching , but stay with the female until she has completed moulting . 
 Around three @-@ quarters of chicks live long enough to fledge , but not more than half of those survive long enough to reproduce . The maximum recorded age is 27 years and 5 months for a Dutch bird . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The pintail feeds by dabbling and upending in shallow water for plant food mainly in the evening or at night , and therefore spends much of the day resting . Its long neck enables it to take food items from the bottom of water bodies up to 30 cm ( 12 in ) deep , which are beyond the reach of other dabbling ducks like the Mallard . 
 The winter diet is mainly plant material including seeds and rhizomes of aquatic plants , but the pintail sometimes feeds on roots , grain and other seeds in fields , though less frequently than other Anas ducks . During the nesting season , this bird eats mainly invertebrate animals , including aquatic insects , molluscs and crustaceans . 
 = = Health = = 
 Pintail nests and chicks are vulnerable to predation by mammals , such as foxes and badgers , and birds like gulls , crows and magpies . The adults can take flight to escape terrestrial predators , but nesting females in particular may be surprised by large carnivores such as bobcats . Large birds of prey , such as northern goshawks , will take ducks from the ground , and some falcons , including the gyrfalcon , have the speed and power to catch flying birds . 
 It is susceptible to a range of parasites including Cryptosporidium , Giardia , tapeworms , blood parasites and external feather lice , and is also affected by other avian diseases . It is often the dominant species in major mortality events from avian botulism and avian cholera , and can also contract avian influenza , the H5N1 strain of which is highly pathogenic and occasionally infects humans . 
 The northern pintail is a popular species for game shooting because of its speed , agility , and excellent eating qualities , and is hunted across its range . Although one of the world 's most numerous ducks , the combination of hunting with other factors has led to population declines , and local restrictions on hunting have been introduced at times to help conserve numbers . 
 This species ' preferred habitat of shallow water is naturally susceptible to problems such as drought or the encroachment of vegetation , but this duck 's habitat might be increasingly threatened by climate change . Populations are also affected by the conversion of wetlands and grassland to arable crops , depriving the duck of feeding and nesting areas . Spring planting means that many nests of this early breeding duck are destroyed by farming activities , and a Canadian study showed that more than half of the surveyed nests were destroyed by agricultural work such as ploughing and harrowing . 
 Hunting with lead shot , along with the use of lead sinkers in angling , has been identified as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl , which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects . A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion , higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway , where lead shot has been banned . In the United States , Canada , and many western European countries , all shot used for waterfowl must now be non @-@ toxic , and therefore may not contain any lead . 
 = = Status = = 
 The northern pintail has a large range , estimated at 28 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 km2 ( 11 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sq mi ) , and a population estimated at 5 @.@ 3 – 5 @.@ 4 million individuals . It is therefore not believed to meet the IUCN Red List threshold criterion of a population decline of more than 30 % in ten years or three generations , and is evaluated as Least Concern . 
 In the Palaearctic , breeding populations are declining in much of the range , including its stronghold in Russia . In other regions , populations are stable or fluctuating . 
 <unk> in North America at least have been badly affected by avian diseases , with the breeding population falling from more than 10 million in 1957 to 3 @.@ 5 million by 1964 . Although the species has recovered from that low point , the breeding population in 1999 was 30 % below the long @-@ term average , despite years of major efforts focused on restoring the species . In 1997 , an estimated 1 @.@ 5 million water birds , the majority being northern pintails , died from avian botulism during two outbreaks in Canada and Utah . 
 The northern pintail is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African @-@ Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds ( AEWA ) applies , but it has no special status under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , which regulates international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants . 
 = Eldridge Recasner = 
 Eldridge David Recasner ( born December 14 , 1967 ) is a retired American professional basketball player . In college , he was a three @-@ time All @-@ Pac @-@ 10 Conference guard for the Washington Huskies men 's basketball team . After college , he played in a variety of professional leagues such as the Continental Basketball Association ( CBA ) and Europe before entering the NBA . He subsequently played for several National Basketball Association 's ( NBA ) teams including the Denver Nuggets , Houston Rockets , Atlanta Hawks , Charlotte Hornets and Los Angeles Clippers . 
 In the 1994 – 95 season , his fifth season after college , he earned the CBA MVP award while leading the Yakima Sun Kings to the league championship . After that CBA season was completed , he signed to play in the NBA at the end of the 1994 – 95 NBA season for the Nuggets . The following season , he earned a spot on the roster of the two @-@ time defending champion Rockets . He played in the NBA for seven more seasons . He had a career 41 % three @-@ point shot field goal percentage and 89 % free throw percentage in eight NBA seasons . In each of his first four full seasons in the NBA , he shot at least 40 % from the three @-@ point line , but he suffered injuries as a passenger during an accident in an automobile driven by Derrick Coleman before the 1999 – 2000 season and never achieved the same level of success after the accident . He later became an assistant coach for the Sioux Falls Skyforce . 
 = = Amateur career = = 
 Born in New Orleans , Louisiana , Recasner was introduced to basketball in fifth grade by his uncles . His first organized game was in junior high school . During the first game , Recasner scored on the wrong basket because he had learned the game on a half @-@ court one @-@ basket basketball court . While growing up , he admired Dr. J , George Gervin , and Marques Johnson . He attended Alfred Lawless High School in New Orleans and was a high school team mate with Robert Pack . Recasner was a senior when Pack was a sophomore . Recasner was a better professional prospect than Pack and outscored Gary Payton five of nine times when the two point guards opposed each other in college . 
 Recasner attended University of Washington where he played for the Huskies . He redshirted during his freshman 1985 – 86 season . Recasner was a member of the 1990 class at Washington , and he was a three @-@ time All @-@ Pac @-@ 10 guard who was selected to the Washington Huskies all @-@ 20th @-@ century team . He was the first three @-@ time captain of the Huskies . Recasner was an architecture major at Washington by his own account , but another account claims he was a black history major . Recasner once scored 29 points against the undefeated and number one ranked Arizona Wildcats men 's basketball team while guarding Sean Elliott . The Wildcats won the game while scoring the most points the Huskies had ever given up ( 109 ) . 
 = = Professional career = = 
 Recasner , a 6 ft 3 in ( 1 @.@ 91 m ) , 190 pounds ( 86 kg ) guard , was never selected in the NBA Draft . However , after spending the 1990 – 91 season with TTL Bamberg in Germany , he played in the Global Basketball Association in 1991 – 92 . Then , he returned to Washington to play in the Continental Basketball Association ( CBA ) during the 1992 – 93 and 1994 – 95 seasons . He played in the CBA for the franchise located in Yakima , Washington , which was near to the Seattle metropolitan area where the University of Washington was located . He played in Turkey in 1993 – 94 . After leading the Yakima Sun Kings to the CBA championships as the league MVP , he signed to a 10 @-@ day contract with the Denver Nuggets on March 3 , 1995 and played in three games . For the 1995 – 96 NBA season he signed as a free agent with the Houston Rockets . He signed as a free agent with the Atlanta Hawks for the 1996 – 97 and 1997 – 98 seasons . He then signed with the Charlotte Hornets in January of the 1998 – 99 season where he stayed for parts of four seasons . He ended his career with two 10 @-@ day contracts for the L.A. Clippers in January 2002 after having been waived by the team . 
 Recasner himself considers being signed by the two @-@ time defending NBA Champions Houston Rockets the highlight of his career . At that point he had gone from playing in the CBA to the best team in the NBA . Recasner earned the starting point guard spot over Kenny Smith and Sam Cassell . In one of his first games as a starter , he went five for six from the three @-@ point line in the fourth quarter against the Detroit Pistons . Unfortunately , by the end of the season the Rockets had several players injured and several CBA players on their roster . 
 His most productive seasons were the two seasons with Atlanta where he totaled over 250 rebounds , 200 assists and nearly 1000 points in 130 games . He played in four post @-@ seasons with three teams . Three of the four teams advanced to the second round of the NBA playoffs . Recasner posted a career 41 % ( 239 – 584 ) three @-@ point shot field goal percentage and ranked in the league 's top 10 during the 1997 – 98 season with a 62 – 148 ( .419 ) shooting percentage . His 1995 – 96 season three point statistics were better at 81 – 191 ( .424 ) , but he did not rank in the top 10 that season . He also posted an 89 % ( 235 – 265 ) career free throw percentage . 
 In a 1997 NBA Playoff game against the Chicago Bulls he got hot and scored 11 quick points in the third quarter to nearly help the Hawks comeback in the game to even the second @-@ round playoff series at two games apiece . At one point after a hot shooting streak , the Bulls assigned Michael Jordan to defend Recasner and the Bulls then stopped the comeback . Recasner 's defense also pressured Jordan into a travelling violation in the final minute of the game . However , efforts by Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen saved the day for the Bulls . 
 Recasner was such a good free throw shooter that once in 1998 during the midst of a 36 consecutive successful free throw streak he was fouled in a two @-@ shot foul situation with his team down by three points and 2 @.@ 3 seconds left . His team needed him to make the first and miss the second , but he was unable to miss . 
 On October 27 , 1999 he was hospitalized in an automobile driven by Derrick Coleman . Coleman had been driving an Sport utility vehicle and had collided with a tractor trailer and was charged with drunk driving . Coleman was eventually acquitted of the charges and found guilty of " unsafe movement " . Recasner endured a fractured right shoulder , partially collapsed lung and other injuries , and a female passenger was also hospitalized . He missed 52 games due to the accident and when he returned to the lineup he only played in seven games . Recasner was very upset with Coleman who did not even check in on whether Recasner was O.K. for over a week after the accident . On Christmas Eve 1999 during his time on the injured reserve , Recasner dragged a Continental Airlines clerk across a table by his necktie in frustration while attempting to book a flight to Texas to visit his sister , who was involved in a serious car accident . Recasner was uncertain whether his sister would survive . He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor fourth @-@ degree assault and was sentenced to a 24 @-@ month deferred sentence , 45 hours of community service and ordered to pay $ 200 in court costs . 
 In 2004 he was named assistant coach of the Bellevue Blackhawks of the American Basketball Association .

 = Megalomys audreyae = 
 Megalomys audreyae , known as the Barbudan ( ? ) Muskrat or the Barbuda giant rice @-@ rat , is an extinct oryzomyine rodent from Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles . Described on the basis of a single mandible ( lower jaw ) with the first molar missing and an isolated upper incisor , both of uncertain but Quaternary age , it is one of the smaller members of the genus Megalomys . Little is known about the animal , and its provenance and distinction from " Ekbletomys hypenemus " , an even larger extinct oryzomyine that also occurred on Barbuda , have been called into question . The toothrow in the lower jaw has a length of 8 @.@ 7 mm at the alveoli . The third molar is relatively narrow and both the second and third molars have a wide valley between their outer cusps . 
 = = History = = 
 Remains of Megalomys audreyae were found by John Walter Gregory among cave breccia on Barbuda around 1900 . The exact locality is unknown . In his 1901 description of Oryzomys luciae , Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major mentioned the Barbuda animal as another member of the Megalomys group , but he never published a description of the latter . Édouard Louis Trouessart gave the name Oryzomys ( Megalomys ) majori to it in his Catalogus <unk> , but he did not describe it and therefore the name is a nomen nudum . In 1926 , Arthur Hopwood finally described it and named it Megalomys audreyae after Gregory 's wife Audrey , following Major 's intention . 
 The oryzomyines of the Caribbean were revised in 1962 by Clayton Ray , who examined the specimens Gregory had found and redescribed them . He suggested that M. audreyae may in fact have come from Barbados instead of similarly named Barbuda , citing the occurrence of a different oryzomyine ( " Ekbletomys hypenemus " ) in other cave deposits on Barbuda , circumstantial evidence for the occurrence of a native rodent on Barbados , uncertainty whether Gregory ever visited Barbuda , and biogeographical considerations . 
 In the subsequent literature , M. audreyae has seldom been mentioned and never been further described . In a 1999 review of recent extinctions in mammals , Ross MacPhee and C. Flemming reported that M. audreyae had been recovered from a locality on Barbuda known as Darby Sink , which had been radiocarbon dated to around 1200 CE . They also stated that M. audreyae and " Ekbletomys " may in fact be identical . However , in 2009 Samuel Turvey suggested that two different rice rats were in fact present in material from Barbuda , which would imply that M. audreyae is a valid species . 
 = = Description = = 
 The only remains of Megalomys audreyae that have been described in the literature are the original two specimens Gregory found , a left upper incisor and a left mandible ( lower jaw ) . The upper incisor is not grooved and its diameter has a length of 2 @.@ 6 mm and width of 1 @.@ 5 mm , but exhibits no other significant characters . 
 The mandible , which is severely damaged and lacks the condyloid , coronoid , and angular processes at the back of the bone , contains the second and third molar and part of the lower incisor , but the first molar is missing . The capsular process of the lower incisor , a slight raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor , is small . The preserved alveoli , the impressions left by the roots , show that the first molar was supported by large roots at the front and back and a smaller root in between these . The second molar is about square and shows the four main cusps commonly present in rodents : the protoconid , metaconid , hypoconid , and entoconid . A strongly developed mesolophid ( a crest ) is also present , as in most oryzomyines . The main valley between the cusps , the hypoflexid , is broad and V @-@ shaped . The third molar is as long as the second , but it is narrower and the entoconid is poorly developed . Again , the hypoflexid is broad and V @-@ shaped . The length of the toothrow at the alveoli is 8 @.@ 7 mm . The length of the second molar is 2 @.@ 5 mm and the width is 2 @.@ 2 mm . The third molar has a length of 2 @.@ 5 mm and width of 1 @.@ 8 mm . 
 When Clayton Ray described " Ekbletomys hypenemus " on the basis of abundant skeletal remains from both Barbuda and Antigua , he carefully distinguished it from M. audreyae , the only other native rodent recorded from those islands . M. audreyae is much smaller than " Ekbletomys " ; for example , 72 specimens of the latter had the alveolar length of the lower molars ranging from 10 @.@ 3 to 12 @.@ 6 mm ( mean 11 @.@ 6 mm , standard deviation 0 @.@ 49 mm ; compare 8 @.@ 7 mm for M. audreyae ) . In addition , the V @-@ shaped <unk> and narrow third molar of M. audreyae contrast with the narrow , parallel @-@ sided <unk> and broad third molar of " Ekbletomys " . These characters , and others observable in species of Megalomys represented by more complete material , convinced Ray that M. audreyae and " Ekbletomys " are not only distinct species , but indeed share no close relationship . Instead , he proposed that the combination of large size , occurrence in the Lesser Antilles , and similarity in molar morphology indicated a relationship between M. audreyae and other species of Megalomys , and he suggested that the similarly sized M. curazensis from Curaçao , off Venezuela , may be most closely related to M. audreyae . 
 = Paulinus of York = 
 Paulinus ( died 10 October 644 ) was a Roman missionary and the first Bishop of York . A member of the Gregorian mission sent in 601 by Pope Gregory I to Christianize the Anglo @-@ Saxons from their native Anglo @-@ Saxon paganism , Paulinus arrived in England by 604 with the second missionary group . Little is known of Paulinus ' activities in the following two decades . 
 After some years spent in Kent , perhaps in 625 , Paulinus was consecrated a bishop . He accompanied Æthelburg of Kent , sister of King Eadbald of Kent , on her journey to Northumbria to marry King Edwin of Northumbria , and eventually succeeded in converting Edwin to Christianity . Paulinus also converted many of Edwin 's subjects and built some churches . One of the women Paulinus baptised was a future saint , Hilda of Whitby . Following Edwin 's death in 633 , Paulinus and Æthelburg fled Northumbria , leaving behind a member of Paulinus ' clergy , James the Deacon . Paulinus returned to Kent , where he became Bishop of Rochester . He received a pallium from the pope , symbolizing his appointment as Archbishop of York , but too late to be effective . After his death in 644 , Paulinus was canonized as a saint and is now venerated in the Eastern Orthodox , Roman Catholic , and Anglican Churches . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Paulinus was a monk from Rome sent to the Kingdom of Kent by Pope Gregory I in 601 , along with Mellitus and others , as part of the second group of missionaries sent to convert the Anglo @-@ Saxons to Christianity . He was probably an Italian by birth . The second group of missionaries arrived in Kent by 604 , but little is known of Paulinus ' further activities until he went to Northumbria . 
 Paulinus remained in Kent until 625 , when he was consecrated as bishop by Justus , the Archbishop of Canterbury , on 21 July . He then accompanied Æthelburg , the sister of King Eadbald , to Northumbria where she was to marry King Edwin . A condition of the marriage was that Edwin had promised that he would allow Æthelburg to remain a Christian and worship as she chose . Bede , writing in the early 8th century , reports that Paulinus wished to convert the Northumbrians , as well as provide religious services to the new queen . 
 There is some difficulty with Bede 's chronology on the date of Æthelburg 's marriage , as surviving papal letters to Edwin urging him to convert imply that Eadbald only recently had become a Christian , which conflicts with Bede 's chronology . The historian D. P. Kirby argues that Paulinus and Æthelburg must therefore have gone to Northumbria earlier than 624 , and that Paulinus went north , not as a bishop , but as a priest , returning later to be consecrated . The historian Henry Mayr @-@ Harting agrees with Kirby 's reasoning . Another historian , Peter Hunter Blair , argues that Æthelburg and Edwin were married before 625 , but that she did not go to Northumbria until 625 . If Kirby 's arguments are accepted , then the date of Paulinus ' consecration needs to be changed by a year , to 21 July 626 . 
 Bede describes Paulinus as " a man tall of stature , a little stooping , with black hair and a thin face , a hooked and thin nose , his aspect both venerable and awe @-@ inspiring " . 
 = = Bishop of York = = 
 Bede relates that Paulinus told Edwin that the birth of his and Æthelburg 's daughter at Easter 626 was because of Paulinus ' prayers . The birth coincided with a foiled assassination attempt on the king by a group of West Saxons from Wessex . Edwin promised to convert to Christianity and allow his new daughter Eanflæd to be baptised if he won a victory over Wessex . He did not fulfill his promise immediately after his subsequent military success against the West Saxons however , only converting after Paulinus had revealed the details of a dream the king had before he took the throne , during his exile at the court of King Rædwald of East Anglia . In this dream , according to Bede , a stranger told Edwin that power would be his in the future when someone laid a hand on his head . As Paulinus was revealing the dream to Edwin , he laid his hand on the king 's head , which was the proof Edwin needed . A late seventh @-@ century hagiography of Pope Gregory I claims that Paulinus was the stranger in the vision ; if true , it might suggest that Paulinus spent some time at Rædwald 's court , although Bede does not mention any such visit . 
 It is unlikely that it was supernatural affairs and Paulinus ' persuasion alone that caused Edwin to convert . The Northumbrian nobles seem to have been willing and the king also received letters from Pope Boniface V urging his conversion . Eventually convinced , Edwin and many of his followers were baptised at York in 627 . One story relates that during a stay with Edwin and Æthelburg at their palace in Yeavering , Paulinus spent 36 days baptising new converts . Paulinus also was an active missionary in Lindsey , and his missionary activities help show the limits of Edwin 's royal authority . 
 Pope Gregory 's plan had been that York would be England 's second metropolitan see , so Paulinus established his church there . Although built of stone , no trace of it has been found . Paulinus also built a number of churches on royal estates . His church in Lincoln has been identified with the earliest building phase of the church of St Paul in the Bail . 
 Among those consecrated by Paulinus were Hilda , later the founding abbess of Whitby Abbey , and Hilda 's successor , Eanflæd , Edwin 's daughter . As the only Roman bishop in England , Paulinus also consecrated another Gregorian missionary , Honorius , as Archbishop of Canterbury after Justus ' death , some time between 628 and 631 . 
 = = Bishop of Rochester = = 
 Edwin was defeated by the Welsh and died at the Battle of Hatfield Chase , on a date traditionally given as 12 October 633 . One problem with the dating of the battle is that Pope Honorius I wrote in June 634 to Paulinus and Archbishop Honorius saying that he was sending a pallium , the symbol of an archbishop 's authority , to each of them . The pope 's letter shows no hint that news of Edwin 's death had reached Rome , almost nine months after the supposed date of the battle . The historian D. P. Kirby argues that this lack of awareness makes it more likely that the battle occurred in 634 . 
 Edwin 's defeat and death caused his kingdom to fragment into at least two parts . It also led to a sharp decline in Christianity in Northumbria when Edwin 's immediate successors reverted to paganism . Although Paulinus ' deacon , James , remained in the north and struggled to rebuild the Roman mission , Edwin 's widow decided to return to Kent . Paulinus went with her , taking Edwin and Æthelburg 's son and daughter , as well as one of Edwin 's grandsons . The two boys went to the continent for safety , to the court of King Dagobert I. Æthelburg , Eanflæd , and Paulinus remained in Kent , where Paulinus was offered the see , or bishopric , of Rochester , which he held until his death . Because the pallium did not reach Paulinus until after he had left York , it was of no use to him . 
 = = Death and veneration = = 
 Paulinus died on 10 October 644 at Rochester , where he was buried in the sacristy of the church . His successor at Rochester was Ithamar , the first Englishman consecrated to a Gregorian missionary see . After Paulinus ' death , Paulinus was revered as a saint , with a feast day on 10 October . When a new church was constructed at Rochester in the 1080s his relics , or remains , were translated ( ritually moved ) to a new shrine . There also were shrines to Paulinus at Canterbury , and at least five churches were dedicated to him . Although Rochester held some of Paulinus ' relics , the promotion of his cult there appears to have occurred after the Norman Conquest . He is considered a saint by the Roman Catholic Church , the Anglican Communion , and the Orthodox Church . 
 Paulinus ' missionary efforts are difficult to evaluate . Bede implies that the mission in Northumbria was successful , but there is little supporting evidence , and it is more likely that Paulinus ' missionary efforts there were relatively ineffectual . Although Osric , one of Edwin 's successors , was converted to Christianity by Paulinus , he returned to paganism after Edwin 's death . Hilda , however , remained a Christian , and eventually went on to become abbess of the influential Whitby Abbey . Northumbria 's conversion to Christianity was mainly achieved by Irish missionaries brought into the region by Edwin 's eventual successor , Oswald .

 = Tourette syndrome = 
 Tourette syndrome ( also called Tourette 's syndrome , Tourette 's disorder , Gilles de la Tourette syndrome , GTS or , more commonly , simply Tourette 's or TS ) is an inherited neuropsychiatric disorder with onset in childhood , characterized by multiple physical ( motor ) tics and at least one vocal ( phonic ) tic . These tics characteristically wax and wane , can be suppressed temporarily , and are preceded by a premonitory urge . Tourette 's is defined as part of a spectrum of tic disorders , which includes provisional , transient and persistent ( chronic ) tics . 
 Tourette 's was once considered a rare and bizarre syndrome , most often associated with the exclamation of obscene words or socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks ( <unk> ) , but this symptom is present in only a small minority of people with Tourette 's . Tourette 's is no longer considered a rare condition , but it is not always correctly identified because most cases are mild and the severity of tics decreases for most children as they pass through adolescence . Between 0 @.@ 4 % and 3 @.@ 8 % of children and adolescents ages 5 to 18 may have Tourette 's ; the prevalence of other tic disorders in school @-@ age children is higher , with the more common tics of eye blinking , coughing , throat clearing , sniffing , and facial movements . Extreme Tourette 's in adulthood is a rarity , and Tourette 's does not adversely affect intelligence or life expectancy . 
 Genetic and environmental factors play a role in the etiology of Tourette 's , but the exact causes are unknown . In most cases , medication is unnecessary . There is no effective treatment for every case of tics , but certain medications and therapies can help when their use is warranted . Education is an important part of any treatment plan , and explanation and reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment . <unk> conditions ( co @-@ occurring diagnoses other than Tourette 's ) such as attention @-@ deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and obsessive – compulsive disorder ( OCD ) are present in many patients seen in tertiary specialty clinics . These other conditions often cause more functional impairment to the individual than the tics that are the hallmark of Tourette 's ; hence , it is important to correctly identify comorbid conditions and treat them . 
 The eponym was bestowed by Jean @-@ Martin Charcot ( 1825 – 1893 ) on behalf of his resident , Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette ( 1857 – 1904 ) , a French physician and neurologist , who published an account of nine patients with Tourette 's in 1885 . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Tics are sudden , repetitive , nonrhythmic movements ( motor tics ) and utterances ( phonic tics ) that involve discrete muscle groups . Motor tics are movement @-@ based tics , while phonic tics are involuntary sounds produced by moving air through the nose , mouth , or throat . 
 Tourette 's was classified by the fourth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM @-@ IV @-@ TR ) as one of several tic disorders " usually first diagnosed in infancy , childhood , or adolescence " according to type ( motor or phonic tics ) and duration ( transient or chronic ) . Transient tic disorders consisted of multiple motor tics , phonic tics or both , with a duration between four weeks and twelve months . Chronic tic disorder was either single or multiple , motor or phonic tics ( but not both ) , which were present for more than a year . Tourette 's is diagnosed when multiple motor tics , and at least one phonic tic , are present for more than a year . The fifth version of the DSM ( DSM @-@ 5 ) , published in May 2013 , reclassified Tourette 's and tic disorders as motor disorders listed in the neurodevelopmental disorder category , and replaced transient tic disorder with provisional tic disorder , but made few other significant changes . 
 Tic disorders are defined only slightly differently by the World Health Organization International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems , ICD @-@ 10 ; code <unk> is for combined vocal and multiple motor tic disorder [ de la Tourette ] . 
 Although Tourette 's is the more severe expression of the spectrum of tic disorders , most cases are mild . The severity of symptoms varies widely among people with Tourette 's , and mild cases may be undetected . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Tics are movements or sounds " that occur intermittently and unpredictably out of a background of normal motor activity " , having the appearance of " normal behaviors gone wrong " . The tics associated with Tourette 's change in number , frequency , severity and anatomical location . <unk> and waning — the ongoing increase and decrease in severity and frequency of tics — occurs differently in each individual . Tics also occur in " bouts of bouts " , which vary for each person . 
 <unk> ( the spontaneous utterance of socially objectionable or taboo words or phrases ) is the most publicized symptom of Tourette 's , but it is not required for a diagnosis of Tourette 's and only about 10 % of Tourette 's patients exhibit it . Echolalia ( repeating the words of others ) and <unk> ( repeating one 's own words ) occur in a minority of cases , while the most common initial motor and vocal tics are , respectively , eye blinking and throat clearing . 
 In contrast to the abnormal movements of other movement disorders ( for example , <unk> , <unk> , myoclonus , and dyskinesias ) , the tics of Tourette 's are temporarily <unk> , nonrhythmic , and often preceded by an unwanted premonitory urge . Immediately preceding tic onset , most individuals with Tourette 's are aware of an urge , similar to the need to sneeze or scratch an itch . Individuals describe the need to tic as a buildup of tension , pressure , or energy which they consciously choose to release , as if they " had to do it " to relieve the sensation or until it feels " just right " . Examples of the premonitory urge are the feeling of having something in one 's throat , or a localized discomfort in the shoulders , leading to the need to clear one 's throat or shrug the shoulders . The actual tic may be felt as relieving this tension or sensation , similar to scratching an itch . Another example is blinking to relieve an uncomfortable sensation in the eye . These urges and sensations , preceding the expression of the movement or vocalization as a tic , are referred to as " premonitory sensory phenomena " or premonitory urges . Because of the urges that precede them , tics are described as semi @-@ voluntary or " <unk> " , rather than specifically involuntary ; they may be experienced as a voluntary , <unk> response to the unwanted premonitory urge . Published descriptions of the tics of Tourette 's identify sensory phenomena as the core symptom of the syndrome , even though they are not included in the diagnostic criteria . 
 While individuals with tics are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods of time , doing so often results in tension or mental exhaustion . People with Tourette 's may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms , or there may be a marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or at work . Some people with Tourette 's may not be aware of the premonitory urge . Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults , but their awareness tends to increase with maturity . They may have tics for several years before becoming aware of premonitory urges . Children may suppress tics while in the doctor 's office , so they may need to be observed while they are not aware they are being watched . The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals , and may be more developed in adults than children . 
 Although there is no such thing as a " typical " case of Tourette syndrome , the condition follows a fairly reliable course in terms of the age of onset and the history of the severity of symptoms . Tics may appear up to the age of eighteen , but the most typical age of onset is from five to seven . A 1998 study published by Leckman and colleagues from the Yale Child Study Center showed that the ages of highest tic severity are eight to twelve ( average ten ) , with tics steadily declining for most patients as they pass through adolescence . The most common , first @-@ presenting tics are eye blinking , facial movements , sniffing and throat clearing . Initial tics present most frequently in midline body regions where there are many muscles , usually the head , neck and facial region . This can be contrasted with the stereotyped movements of other disorders ( such as <unk> and stereotypies of the autism spectrum disorders ) , which typically have an earlier age of onset , are more symmetrical , rhythmical and bilateral , and involve the extremities ( e.g. , flapping the hands ) . Tics that appear early in the course of the condition are frequently confused with other conditions , such as allergies , asthma , and vision problems : pediatricians , <unk> and ophthalmologists are typically the first to see a child with tics . 
 Among patients whose symptoms are severe enough to warrant referral to clinics , obsessive – compulsive disorder ( OCD ) and attention @-@ deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) are often associated with Tourette 's . <unk> resembling tics are present in some individuals with OCD ; " tic @-@ related OCD " is hypothesized to be a subgroup of OCD , distinguished from non @-@ tic related OCD by the type and nature of obsessions and compulsions . Not all persons with Tourette 's have ADHD or OCD or other comorbid conditions , although in clinical populations , a high percentage of patients presenting for care do have ADHD . One author reports that a ten @-@ year overview of patient records revealed about 40 % of patients with Tourette 's have " TS @-@ only " or " pure TS " , referring to Tourette syndrome in the absence of ADHD , OCD and other disorders . Another author reports that 57 % of 656 patients presenting with tic disorders had uncomplicated tics , while 43 % had tics plus comorbid conditions . People with " full @-@ blown Tourette 's " have significant comorbid conditions in addition to tics . 
 = = Causes = = 
 The exact cause of Tourette 's is unknown , but it is well established that both genetic and environmental factors are involved . Genetic epidemiology studies have shown that the overwhelming majority of cases of Tourette 's are inherited , although the exact mode of inheritance is not yet known and no gene has been identified . In other cases , tics are associated with disorders other than Tourette 's , a phenomenon known as tourettism . 
 A person with Tourette 's has about a 50 % chance of passing the gene ( s ) to one of his or her children , but Tourette 's is a condition of variable expression and incomplete penetrance . Thus , not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms ; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms , or no symptoms at all . The gene ( s ) may express as Tourette 's , as a milder tic disorder ( provisional or chronic tics ) , or as obsessive – compulsive symptoms without tics . Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene ( s ) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention . Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability : males are more likely than females to express tics . 
 Non @-@ genetic , environmental , post @-@ infectious , or psychosocial factors — while not causing Tourette 's — can influence its severity . Autoimmune processes may affect tic onset and exacerbation in some cases . In 1998 , a team at the US National Institute of Mental Health proposed a hypothesis based on observation of 50 children that both obsessive – compulsive disorder ( OCD ) and tic disorders may arise in a subset of children as a result of a <unk> autoimmune process . Children who meet five diagnostic criteria are classified , according to the hypothesis , as having Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections ( <unk> ) . This contentious hypothesis is the focus of clinical and laboratory research , but remains unproven . 
 Some forms of OCD may be genetically linked to Tourette 's . A subset of OCD is thought to be <unk> related to Tourette 's and may be a different expression of the same factors that are important for the expression of tics . The genetic relationship of ADHD to Tourette syndrome , however , has not been fully established . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 The exact mechanism affecting the inherited vulnerability to Tourette 's has not been established , and the precise etiology is unknown . Tics are believed to result from dysfunction in cortical and subcortical regions , the thalamus , basal ganglia and frontal cortex . <unk> models implicate failures in circuits connecting the brain 's cortex and <unk> , and imaging techniques implicate the basal ganglia and frontal cortex . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM @-@ 5 ) , Tourette ’ s may be diagnosed when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year ; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent . The onset must have occurred before the age of 18 , and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance ( such as cocaine ) . Hence , other medical conditions that include tics or tic @-@ like movements — such as autism or other causes of tourettism — must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette 's diagnosis . Since 2000 , the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette 's , but do not have distress or impairment . 
 There are no specific medical or screening tests that can be used in diagnosing Tourette 's ; it is frequently misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed , partly because of the wide expression of severity , ranging from mild ( the majority of cases ) or moderate , to severe ( the rare , but more widely recognized and publicized cases ) . Coughing , eye blinking , and tics that mimic unrelated conditions such as asthma are commonly misdiagnosed . 
 The diagnosis is made based on observation of the individual 's symptoms and family history , and after ruling out secondary causes of tic disorders . In patients with a typical onset and a family history of tics or obsessive – compulsive disorder , a basic physical and neurological examination may be sufficient . 
 There is no requirement that other comorbid conditions ( such as ADHD or OCD ) be present , but if a physician believes that there may be another condition present that could explain tics , tests may be ordered as necessary to rule out that condition . An example of this is when diagnostic confusion between tics and seizure activity exists , which would call for an EEG , or if there are symptoms that indicate an MRI to rule out brain abnormalities . TSH levels can be measured to rule out hypothyroidism , which can be a cause of tics . Brain imaging studies are not usually warranted . In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms , a urine drug screen for cocaine and stimulants might be necessary . If a family history of liver disease is present , serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels can rule out Wilson 's disease . Most cases are diagnosed by merely observing a history of tics . 
 Secondary causes of tics ( not related to inherited Tourette syndrome ) are commonly referred to as tourettism . <unk> , <unk> , other genetic conditions , and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome . Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders , autism spectrum disorders , and stereotypic movement disorder ; Sydenham 's chorea ; idiopathic dystonia ; and genetic conditions such as Huntington 's disease , neuroacanthocytosis , <unk> @-@ Spatz syndrome , Duchenne muscular dystrophy , Wilson 's disease , and tuberous sclerosis . Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome , <unk> syndrome , <unk> syndrome and fragile X syndrome . Acquired causes of tics include drug @-@ induced tics , head trauma , encephalitis , stroke , and carbon monoxide poisoning . The symptoms of Lesch @-@ Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with Tourette syndrome . Most of these conditions are rarer than tic disorders , and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out , without medical or screening tests . 
 = = Screening = = 
 Although not all people with Tourette 's have comorbid conditions , most Tourette 's patients presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions along with their motor and phonic tics . Associated conditions include attention @-@ deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADD or ADHD ) , obsessive – compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , learning disabilities and sleep disorders . Disruptive behaviors , impaired functioning , or cognitive impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette 's and ADHD may be accounted for by the comorbid ADHD , highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid conditions . Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child . Tic disorders in the absence of ADHD do not appear to be associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment , while impairment in school , family , or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid conditions and often determines whether therapy is needed . 
 Because comorbid conditions such as OCD and ADHD can be more impairing than tics , these conditions are included in an evaluation of patients presenting with tics . " It is critical to note that the comorbid conditions may determine functional status more strongly than the tic disorder , " according to Samuel Zinner , MD . The initial assessment of a patient referred for a tic disorder should include a thorough evaluation , including a family history of tics , ADHD , obsessive – compulsive symptoms , and other chronic medical , psychiatric and neurological conditions . Children and adolescents with TS who have learning difficulties are candidates for psychoeducational testing , particularly if the child also has ADHD . <unk> comorbid conditions may result in functional impairment , and it is necessary to identify and treat these conditions to improve functioning . Complications may include depression , sleep problems , social discomfort and self @-@ injury . 
 = = Management = = 
 The treatment of Tourette 's focuses on identifying and helping the individual manage the most troubling or impairing symptoms . Most cases of Tourette 's are mild , and do not require pharmacological treatment ; instead , <unk> therapy , education , and reassurance may be sufficient . Treatments , where warranted , can be divided into those that target tics and comorbid conditions , which , when present , are often a larger source of impairment than the tics themselves . Not all people with tics have comorbid conditions , but when those conditions are present , they often take treatment priority . 
 There is no cure for Tourette 's and no medication that works universally for all individuals without significant adverse effects . Knowledge , education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for tic disorders . The management of the symptoms of Tourette 's may include pharmacological , behavioral and psychological therapies . While pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms , other treatments ( such as supportive psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy ) may help to avoid or ameliorate depression and social isolation , and to improve family support . Educating a patient , family , and surrounding community ( such as friends , school , and church ) is a key treatment strategy , and may be all that is required in mild cases . 
 Medication is available to help when symptoms interfere with functioning . The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics — typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone ( trade name <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , haloperidol ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) — can have long @-@ term and short @-@ term adverse effects . The antihypertensive agents clonidine ( trade name <unk> ) and guanfacine ( Tenex ) are also used to treat tics ; studies show variable efficacy , but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics . Stimulants and other medications may be useful in treating ADHD when it co @-@ occurs with tic disorders . Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail , including guanfacine ( trade name Tenex ) , atomoxetine ( <unk> ) and tricyclic antidepressants . <unk> ( <unk> ) , a tricyclic , and SSRIs — a class of antidepressants including fluoxetine ( Prozac ) , sertraline ( Zoloft ) , and fluvoxamine ( <unk> ) — may be prescribed when a Tourette 's patient also has symptoms of obsessive – compulsive disorder . Several other medications have been tried , but evidence to support their use is unconvincing . 
 Because children with tics often present to physicians when their tics are most severe , and because of the waxing and waning nature of tics , it is recommended that medication not be started immediately or changed often . Frequently , the tics subside with explanation , reassurance , understanding of the condition and a supportive environment . When medication is used , the goal is not to eliminate symptoms : it should be used at the lowest possible dose that manages symptoms without adverse effects , given that these may be more disturbing than the symptoms for which they were prescribed . 
 Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) is a useful treatment when OCD is present , and there is increasing evidence supporting the use of habit reversal ( HRT ) in the treatment of tics . There is evidence that HRT reduces tic severity , but there are methodological limitations in the studies , and a need for more trained specialists and better large @-@ scale studies . 
 Relaxation techniques , such as exercise , yoga or meditation , may be useful in relieving the stress that may aggravate tics , but the majority of behavioral interventions ( such as relaxation training and biofeedback , with the exception of habit reversal ) have not been systematically evaluated and are not empirically supported therapies for Tourette 's . Deep brain stimulation has been used to treat adults with severe Tourette 's that does not respond to conventional treatment , but it is regarded as an invasive , experimental procedure that is unlikely to become widespread . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Tourette syndrome is a spectrum disorder — its severity ranges over a spectrum from mild to severe . The majority of cases are mild and require no treatment . In these cases , the impact of symptoms on the individual may be mild , to the extent that casual observers might not know of their condition . The overall prognosis is positive , but a minority of children with Tourette syndrome have severe symptoms that persist into adulthood . A study of 46 subjects at 19 years of age found that the symptoms of 80 % had minimum to mild impact on their overall functioning , and that the other 20 % experienced at least a moderate impact on their overall functioning . The rare minority of severe cases can inhibit or prevent individuals from holding a job or having a fulfilling social life . In a follow @-@ up study of thirty @-@ one adults with Tourette 's , all patients completed high school , 52 % finished at least two years of college , and 71 % were full @-@ time employed or were pursuing higher education . 
 Regardless of symptom severity , individuals with Tourette 's have a normal life span . Although the symptoms may be lifelong and chronic for some , the condition is not degenerative or life @-@ threatening . Intelligence is normal in those with Tourette 's , although there may be learning disabilities . Severity of tics early in life does not predict tic severity in later life , and prognosis is generally favorable , although there is no reliable means of predicting the outcome for a particular individual . The gene or genes associated with Tourette 's have not been identified , and there is no potential " cure " . A higher rate of migraines than the general population and sleep disturbances are reported . 
 Several studies have demonstrated that the condition in most children improves with maturity . Tics may be at their highest severity at the time that they are diagnosed , and often improve with understanding of the condition by individuals and their families and friends . The statistical age of highest tic severity is typically between eight and twelve , with most individuals experiencing steadily declining tic severity as they pass through adolescence . One study showed no correlation with tic severity and the onset of puberty , in contrast with the popular belief that tics increase at puberty . In many cases , a complete remission of tic symptoms occurs after adolescence . However , a study using videotape to record tics in adults found that , although tics diminished in comparison with childhood , and all measures of tic severity improved by adulthood , 90 % of adults still had tics . Half of the adults who considered themselves tic @-@ free still displayed evidence of tics . 
 Many people with TS may not realize they have tics ; because tics are more commonly expressed in private , TS may go unrecognized or undetected . It is not uncommon for the parents of affected children to be unaware that they , too , may have had tics as children . Because Tourette 's tends to subside with maturity , and because milder cases of Tourette 's are now more likely to be recognized , the first realization that a parent had tics as a child may not come until their offspring is diagnosed . It is not uncommon for several members of a family to be diagnosed together , as parents bringing children to a physician for an evaluation of tics become aware that they , too , had tics as a child . 
 Children with Tourette 's may suffer socially if their tics are viewed as " bizarre " . If a child has disabling tics , or tics that interfere with social or academic functioning , supportive psychotherapy or school accommodations can be helpful . Because comorbid conditions ( such as ADHD or OCD ) can cause greater impact on overall functioning than tics , a thorough evaluation for comorbidity is called for when symptoms and impairment warrant . 
 A supportive environment and family generally gives those with Tourette 's the skills to manage the disorder . People with Tourette 's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor . Accomplished musicians , athletes , public speakers , and professionals from all walks of life are found among people with Tourette 's . Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics . A person who was misunderstood , punished , or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children who enjoyed an understanding and supportive environment . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 The tics of Tourette syndrome begin in childhood and tend to remit or subside with maturity ; thus , a diagnosis may no longer be warranted for many adults , and observed prevalence rates are higher among children than adults . As children pass through adolescence , about one @-@ quarter become tic @-@ free , almost one @-@ half see their tics diminish to a minimal or mild level , and less than one @-@ quarter have persistent tics . Only 5 to 14 % of adults experience worse tics in adulthood than in childhood . 
 Tourette syndrome is found among all social , racial and ethnic groups and has been reported in all parts of the world ; it is three to four times more frequent among males than among females . The reported prevalence of TS varies " according to the source , age , and sex of the sample ; the ascertainment procedures ; and diagnostic system " from a low of .05 % in a 1993 study to a high of 2 @.@ 9 % in a 1998 study . 
 Up to 1 % of the overall population experiences tic disorders , including chronic tics and transient tics of childhood . Chronic tics affect 5 % of children , and transient tics affect up to 20 % . Robertson ( 2011 ) suggests that the prevalence of Tourette syndrome alone in the general population is also 1 % , with a range reported between .4 % and 3 @.@ 8 % for children ages 5 to 18 . Singer ( 2011 ) states the prevalence of TS in the overall population at any time is .1 % for impairing cases and .6 % for all cases , while Bloch and colleagues ( 2011 ) state the overall prevalence as between .3 and 1 % . According to Lombroso and Scahill ( 2008 ) , the emerging consensus is that .1 to 1 % of children have Tourette 's , with several studies supporting a tighter range of .6 to .8 % . Bloch and Leckman ( 2009 ) and Swain ( 2007 ) report a range of prevalence in children of .4 to .6 % , Knight et al . ( 2012 ) estimate <unk> % in children , and Du et al . ( 2010 ) report that 1 to 3 % of Western school @-@ age children have Tourette 's . Prevalence rates in special education populations are higher . Using year 2000 census data , a prevalence range of .1 to 1 % yields an estimate of 53 @,@ 000 – 530 @,@ 000 school @-@ age children with Tourette 's in the US , and a prevalence estimate of .1 % means that in 2001 about 553 @,@ 000 people in the UK age 5 or older would have Tourette 's . Most cases would be mild and almost unrecognizable in older individuals . 
 Tourette syndrome was once thought to be rare : in 1972 , the US National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) believed there were fewer than 100 cases in the United States , and a 1973 registry reported only 485 cases worldwide . However , multiple studies published since 2000 have consistently demonstrated that the prevalence is much higher than previously thought . Discrepancies across current and prior prevalence estimates come from several factors : ascertainment bias in earlier samples drawn from clinically referred cases , assessment methods that may fail to detect milder cases , and differences in diagnostic criteria and thresholds . There were few broad @-@ based community studies published before 2000 and until the 1980s , most epidemiological studies of Tourette syndrome were based on individuals referred to tertiary care or specialty clinics . Individuals with mild symptoms may not seek treatment and physicians may not confer an official diagnosis of TS on children out of concern for stigmatization ; children with milder symptoms are unlikely to be referred to specialty clinics , so prevalence studies have an inherent bias towards more severe cases . Studies of Tourette syndrome are vulnerable to error because tics vary in intensity and expression , are often intermittent , and are not always recognized by clinicians , patients , family members , friends or teachers ; approximately 20 % of persons with Tourette syndrome do not recognize that they have tics . Newer studies — recognizing that tics may often be undiagnosed and hard to detect — use direct classroom observation and multiple informants ( parent , teacher , and trained observers ) , and therefore record more cases than older studies relying on referrals . As the diagnostic threshold and assessment methodology have moved towards recognition of milder cases , the result is an increase in estimated prevalence . 
 Tourette 's is associated with several comorbid conditions , or co @-@ occurring diagnoses , which are often the major source of impairment for an affected child . Most individuals with tics do not seek medical attention , so epidemiological studies of TS " reflect a strong ascertainment bias " , but among those who do warrant medical attention , the majority have other conditions , and up to 50 % have ADHD or OCD . One author reports that a ten @-@ year overview of patient records revealed about 40 % of patients with Tourette 's have " TS @-@ only " or " pure TS " , referring to Tourette syndrome in the absence of ADHD , OCD and other disorders . In children with tics , the additional presence of ADHD is associated with functional impairment , disruptive behavior , and tic severity . Other comorbid conditions include self @-@ injurious behaviors ( SIB ) , anxiety , depression , personality disorders , oppositional defiant disorder , and conduct disorders . 
 = = History and research directions = = 
 The first presentation of Tourette syndrome is thought to be in the book , Malleus Maleficarum ( " Witch 's hammer " ) by Jakob Sprenger and Heinrich Kraemer , published in the late 15th century and describing a priest whose tics were " believed to be related to possession by the devil " . A French doctor , Jean Marc Gaspard Itard , reported the first case of Tourette syndrome in 1825 , describing Marquise de Dampierre , an important woman of nobility in her time . Jean @-@ Martin Charcot , an influential French physician , assigned his resident Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette , a French physician and neurologist , to study patients at the Salpêtrière Hospital , with the goal of defining an illness distinct from hysteria and from chorea . 
 In 1885 , Gilles de la Tourette published an account in Study of a Nervous Affliction describing nine persons with " convulsive tic disorder " , concluding that a new clinical category should be defined . The eponym was later bestowed by Charcot after and on behalf of Gilles de la Tourette . 
 Little progress was made over the next century in explaining or treating tics , and a psychogenic view prevailed well into the 20th century . The possibility that movement disorders , including Tourette syndrome , might have an organic origin was raised when an encephalitis epidemic from 1918 – 1926 led to a subsequent epidemic of tic disorders . 
 During the 1960s and 1970s , as the beneficial effects of haloperidol ( <unk> ) on tics became known , the psychoanalytic approach to Tourette syndrome was questioned . The turning point came in 1965 , when Arthur K. Shapiro — described as " the father of modern tic disorder research " — treated a Tourette ’ s patient with haloperidol , and published a paper criticizing the psychoanalytic approach . 
 Since the 1990s , a more neutral view of Tourette 's has emerged , in which biological vulnerability and adverse environmental events are seen to interact . In 2000 , the American Psychiatric Association published the DSM @-@ IV @-@ TR , revising the text of DSM @-@ IV to no longer require that symptoms of tic disorders cause distress or impair functioning , recognizing that clinicians often see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette 's , but do not have distress or impairment . 
 Findings since 1999 have advanced TS science in the areas of genetics , neuroimaging , neurophysiology , and neuropathology . Questions remain regarding how best to classify Tourette syndrome , and how closely Tourette 's is related to other movement disorders or psychiatric disorders . Good epidemiologic data is still lacking , and available treatments are not risk free and not always well tolerated . High @-@ profile media coverage focuses on treatments that do not have established safety or efficacy , such as deep brain stimulation , and alternative therapies involving unstudied efficacy and side effects are pursued by many parents . 
 = = Society and culture = = 
 Not everyone with Tourette 's wants treatment or a " cure " , especially if that means they may " lose " something else in the process . Researchers Leckman and Cohen , and former US Tourette Syndrome Association ( TSA ) national board member Kathryn <unk> , believe that there may be latent advantages associated with an individual 's genetic vulnerability to developing Tourette syndrome , such as a heightened awareness and increased attention to detail and surroundings that may have adaptive value . There is evidence to support the clinical lore that children with " TS @-@ only " ( Tourette 's in the absence of comorbid conditions ) are unusually gifted : neuropsychological studies have identified advantages in children with TS @-@ only . Children with TS @-@ only are faster than the average for their age group on timed tests of motor coordination . 
 Notable individuals with Tourette syndrome are found in all walks of life , including musicians , athletes , media figures , teachers , physicians and authors . The best @-@ known example of a person who may have used obsessive – compulsive traits to advantage is Samuel Johnson , the 18th @-@ century English man of letters , who likely had Tourette syndrome as evidenced by the writings of James Boswell . Johnson wrote A Dictionary of the English Language in 1747 , and was a prolific writer , poet , and critic . Tim Howard , described by the Chicago Tribune as the " rarest of creatures – an American soccer hero " and by the TSA as the " most notable individual with Tourette Syndrome around the world " says that his neurological makeup gave him an enhanced perception and an ability to hyper @-@ focus that contributed to his success on the field . 
 Although it has been speculated that Mozart had Tourette 's , no Tourette 's expert or organization has presented credible evidence to support such a conclusion , and there are problems with the arguments supporting the diagnosis : tics are not transferred to the written form , as is supposed with Mozart 's scatological writings ; the medical history in retrospect is not thorough ; side effects due to other conditions may be misinterpreted ; " it is not proven whether written documents can account for the existence of a vocal tic " and " the evidence of motor tics in Mozart 's life is doubtful " .

 Pre @-@ dating Gilles de la Tourette 's 1885 publication , likely portrayals of TS or tic disorders in fictional literature are Mr. Pancks in Little <unk> by Charles Dickens and Nikolai Levin in Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy . The entertainment industry has been criticized for depicting those with Tourette syndrome as social misfits whose only tic is <unk> , which has furthered stigmatization and the public 's misunderstanding of those with Tourette 's . The <unk> symptoms of Tourette 's are also fodder for radio and television talk shows in the US and in the British media . 
 = Robert Falcon Scott = 
 Captain Robert Falcon Scott CVO RN ( 6 June 1868 – 29 March 1912 ) was a British Royal Navy officer and explorer who led two expeditions to the Antarctic regions : the Discovery Expedition , 1901 – 1904 , and the ill @-@ fated Terra Nova Expedition , 1910 – 1913 . On the first expedition , he set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82 ° S and discovered the Polar Plateau , on which the South Pole is located . During the second venture , Scott led a party of five which reached the South Pole on 17 January 1912 after Roald Amundsen 's Norwegian expedition . On their return journey , Scott 's party discovered plant fossils , proving Antarctica was once forested and joined to other continents . A planned meeting with supporting dog teams from the base camp failed , although Scott had ordered his team to do so , and at a distance of 150 miles from their base camp and 11 miles from the next depot , Scott and his companions died from a combination of exhaustion , starvation and extreme cold . 
 Before his appointment to lead the Discovery Expedition , Scott had followed the conventional career of a naval officer in the Royal Navy . In 1899 , he had a chance encounter with Sir Clements Markham , the president of the Royal Geographical Society , thus learning of a planned Antarctic expedition , and soon volunteered to lead this expedition . Having taken this step , his name became inseparably associated with the Antarctic , the field of work to which he remained committed during the final twelve years of his life . 
 Following the news of his death , Scott became a celebrated hero , a status reflected by the many permanent memorials erected across the nation . In the closing decades of the 20th century , Scott became a figure of controversy , with questions raised about his competence and character . Commentators in the 21st century have on the whole regarded Scott more positively , noting errors made by his team members , but attributing the expedition 's fate primarily to misfortune . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Family = = = 
 Scott was born on 6 June 1868 , the third child out of six and elder son of John Edward and Hannah ( née Cuming ) Scott of Stoke Damerel , near Devonport . Although Scott 's father was a brewer and magistrate , there were naval and military traditions in the family , Scott 's grandfather and four uncles all having served in the army or navy . John Scott 's prosperity came from the ownership of a small Plymouth brewery which he inherited from his father and subsequently sold . His early childhood years were spent in comfort , but In later years , when Scott was establishing his naval career , the family would suffer serious financial misfortune . 
 In accordance with the family 's tradition , Robert and his younger brother Archie were predestined for careers in the armed services . Robert spent four years at a local day school before being sent to Stubbington House School in Hampshire , a cramming establishment preparing candidates for the entrance examinations to the naval training ship HMS Britannia at Dartmouth . Having passed these exams Scott , began his naval career in 1881 , as a cadet , aged only 13 years old . 
 = = = Early naval career = = = 
 In July 1883 , Scott passed out of Britannia as a midshipman , seventh overall in a class of 26 . By October , he was en route to South Africa to join HMS Boadicea , the flagship of the Cape squadron , the first of several ships on which he served during his midshipman years . While stationed in St Kitts , West Indies , on HMS Rover , he had his first encounter with Clements Markham , then Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society , who would loom large in Scott 's later career . On this occasion , 1 March 1887 , Markham observed Midshipman Scott 's cutter winning that morning 's race across the bay . Markham 's habit was to " collect " likely young naval officers with a view to their undertaking polar exploration work in the future . He was impressed by Scott 's intelligence , enthusiasm and charm , and the 18 @-@ year @-@ old midshipman was duly noted . 
 In March 1888 Scott passed his examinations for sub @-@ lieutenant , with four first class certificates out of five . His career progressed smoothly , with service on various ships and promotion to lieutenant in 1889 . In 1891 , after a long spell in foreign waters , he applied for the two @-@ year torpedo training course on HMS Vernon , an important career step . He graduated with first class certificates in both the theory and practical examinations . A small blot occurred in the summer of 1893 when , while commanding a torpedo boat , Scott ran it aground , a mishap which earned him a mild rebuke . 
 During the research for his dual biography of Scott and Roald Amundsen , polar historian Roland Huntford investigated a possible scandal in Scott 's early naval career , related to the period 1889 – 90 when Scott was a lieutenant on HMS Amphion . According to Huntford , Scott " disappears from naval records " for eight months , from mid @-@ August 1889 until 26 March 1890 . Huntford hints at involvement with a married American woman , a cover @-@ up , and protection by senior officers . Biographer David Crane reduces the missing period to eleven weeks , but is unable to clarify further . He rejects the notion of protection by senior officers on the grounds that Scott was not important or well @-@ connected enough to warrant this . Documents that may have offered explanations are missing from Admiralty records . 
 In 1894 , while serving as torpedo officer on the depot ship HMS Vulcan , Scott learned of the financial calamity that had overtaken his family . John Scott , having sold the brewery and invested the proceeds unwisely , had lost all his capital and was now virtually bankrupt . At the age of 63 , and in poor health , he was forced to take a job as a brewery manager and move his family to Shepton Mallet , Somerset . Three years later , while Robert was serving with the Channel squadron flagship HMS Majestic , John Scott died of heart disease , creating a fresh family crisis . Hannah Scott and her two unmarried daughters now relied entirely on the service pay of Scott and the salary of younger brother Archie , who had left the army for a higher @-@ paid post in the colonial service . Archie 's own death in the autumn of 1898 , after contracting typhoid fever , meant that the whole financial responsibility for the family rested on Scott . 
 Promotion , and the extra income this would bring , now became a matter of considerable concern to Scott . In the Royal Navy however , opportunities for career advancement were both limited and keenly sought after by ambitious officers . Early in June 1899 , while home on leave , he had a chance encounter in a London street with Clements Markham , who was now knighted and President of the Royal Geographical Society ( RGS ) , and learned for the first time of an impending Antarctic expedition with the Discovery , under the auspices of the RGS . It was the opportunity for early command and a chance to distinguish himself , rather than any predilection for polar exploration which motivated Scott , according to Crane . What passed between them on this occasion is not recorded , but a few days later , on 11 June , Scott appeared at the Markham residence and volunteered to lead the expedition . 
 = = Discovery Expedition 1901 – 1904 = = 
 The British National Antarctic Expedition , later known as the Discovery Expedition , was a joint enterprise of the RGS and the Royal Society . A long @-@ cherished dream of Markham 's , it required all of his skills and cunning to bring the expedition to fruition , under naval command and largely staffed by naval personnel . Scott may not have been Markham 's first choice as leader but , having decided on him , the older man 's support remained constant . There were committee battles over the scope of Scott 's responsibilities , with the Royal Society pressing to put a scientist in charge of the expedition 's programme while Scott merely commanded the ship . Eventually , however , Markham 's view prevailed ; Scott was given overall command , and was promoted to the rank of commander before Discovery sailed for the Antarctic on 6 August 1901 . King Edward VII , who showed a keen interest in the expedition , visited the Discovery the day before the ship left British shores in August 1901 , and during the visit appointed Scott a Member of the Royal Victorian Order ( MVO ) , his personal gift . 
 Experience of Antarctic or Arctic waters was almost entirely lacking within the 50 @-@ strong party and there was very little special training in equipment or techniques before the ship set sail . Dogs were taken , as were skis , but the dogs succumbed to disease in the first season . Nevertheless , the dogs ' performance impressed Scott , and , despite moral qualms , he implemented the principle of slaughtering dogs for dog @-@ food to increase their range . During an early attempt at ice travel , a blizzard trapped expedition members in their tent and their decision to leave it resulted in the death of George Vince , who slipped over a precipice on 11 March 1902 . 
 The expedition had both scientific and exploration objectives ; the latter included a long journey south , in the direction of the South Pole . This march , undertaken by Scott , Ernest Shackleton and Edward Wilson , took them to a latitude of 82 ° 17 ′ S , about 530 miles ( 850 km ) from the pole . A harrowing return journey brought about Shackleton 's physical collapse and his early departure from the expedition . The second year showed improvements in technique and achievement , culminating in Scott 's western journey which led to the discovery of the Polar Plateau . This has been described by one writer as " one of the great polar journeys " . The scientific results of the expedition included important biological , zoological and geological findings . Some of the meteorological and magnetic readings , however , were later criticised as amateurish and inaccurate . 
 At the end of the expedition it took the combined efforts of two relief ships and the use of explosives to free Discovery from the ice . His insistence during the expedition on Royal Navy formalities had made for uneasy relations with the merchant navy contingent , many of whom departed for home with the first relief ship in March 1903 . Second @-@ in @-@ command Albert Armitage , a merchant officer , was offered the chance to go home on compassionate grounds , but chose to interpret the offer as a personal slight , and refused . Armitage also promoted the idea that the decision to send Shackleton home on the relief ship arose from Scott 's animosity rather than Shackleton 's physical breakdown . Although there were later tensions between Scott and Shackleton , when their polar ambitions directly clashed , in public mutual civilities were preserved ; Scott joined in the official receptions that greeted Shackleton on his return in 1909 after the Nimrod Expedition , and the two were exchanging polite letters about their respective ambitions in 1909 – 10 . 
 = = Between expeditions = = 
 = = = Popular hero = = = 
 Discovery returned to Britain in September 1904 . The expedition had caught the public imagination , and Scott became a popular hero . He was awarded a cluster of honours and medals , including many from overseas , and was promoted to the rank of captain . He was invited to Balmoral Castle , where King Edward VII promoted him a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order ( CVO ) . 
 Scott 's next few years were crowded . For more than a year he was occupied with public receptions , lectures and the writing of the expedition record , The Voyage of the Discovery . In January 1906 , he resumed his full @-@ time naval career , first as an Assistant Director of Naval Intelligence at the Admiralty and , in August , as flag @-@ captain to Rear @-@ Admiral Sir George Egerton on HMS Victorious . He was now moving in ever more exalted social circles — a telegram to Markham in February 1907 refers to meetings with the Queen and Crown Prince of Portugal , and a later letter home reports lunching with the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Fleet and Prince Heinrich of Prussia . HMS Albemarle , a battleship commanded by Scott , collided with the battleship HMS Commonwealth on 11 February 1907 , suffering minor bow damage . 
 = = = Dispute with Shackleton = = = 
 By early 1906 , Scott had sounded out the RGS about the possible funding of a future Antarctic expedition . It was therefore unwelcome news to him that Ernest Shackleton had announced his own plans to travel to Discovery 's old McMurdo Sound base and launch a bid for the South Pole from there . Scott claimed , in the first of a series of letters to Shackleton , that the area around McMurdo was his own " field of work " to which he had prior rights until he chose to give them up , and that Shackleton should therefore work from an entirely different area . In this , he was strongly supported by Discovery 's former zoologist , Edward Wilson , who asserted that Scott 's rights extended to the entire Ross Sea sector . This Shackleton refused to concede . 
 Finally , to end the impasse , Shackleton agreed , in a letter to Scott dated 17 May 1907 , to work to the east of the 170 ° W meridian and therefore to avoid all the familiar Discovery ground . In the end it was a promise that he was unable to keep after his search for alternative landing grounds proved fruitless . With his only other option being to return home , he set up his headquarters at Cape Royds , close to the old Discovery base . For this he was roundly condemned by the British polar establishment at the time . 
 Among modern polar writers , Ranulph Fiennes regards Shackleton 's actions as a technical breach of honour , but adds : " My personal belief is that Shackleton was basically honest but circumstances forced his McMurdo landing , much to his distress . " The polar historian Beau Riffenburgh states that the promise to Scott " should never ethically have been demanded " , and compares Scott 's intransigence on this matter unfavourably with the generous attitudes of the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen , who gave freely of his advice and expertise to all , whether they were potential rivals or not .

 Scott , who because of his Discovery fame had entered Edwardian society , first met Kathleen Bruce early in 1907 at a private luncheon party . She was a <unk> , socialite and cosmopolitan who had studied under Auguste Rodin and whose circle included Isadora Duncan , Pablo Picasso and Aleister Crowley . Her initial meeting with Scott was brief , but when they met again later that year , the mutual attraction was obvious . A stormy courtship followed ; Scott was not her only suitor — his main rival was would @-@ be novelist Gilbert Cannan — and his absences at sea did not assist his cause . However , Scott 's persistence was rewarded and , on 2 September 1908 , at the Chapel Royal , Hampton Court Palace , the wedding took place . Their only child , Peter Markham Scott , born 14 September 1909 , was to found the World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) .

 Shackleton returned from the Antarctic having narrowly failed to reach the Pole , and this gave Scott the impetus to proceed with plans for his second Antarctic expedition . On 24 March 1909 , he had taken the Admiralty @-@ based appointment of naval assistant to the Second Sea Lord which placed him conveniently in London . In December he was released on half @-@ pay , to take up the full @-@ time command of the British Antarctic Expedition 1910 , to be known as the Terra Nova Expedition from its ship , Terra Nova . 
 It was the expressed hope of the RGS that this expedition would be " scientific primarily , with exploration and the Pole as secondary objects " but , unlike the Discovery Expedition , neither they nor the Royal Society were in charge this time . In his expedition prospectus , Scott stated that its main objective was " to reach the South Pole , and to secure for the British Empire the honour of this achievement " . Scott had , as Markham observed , been " bitten by the Pole mania " . 
 In a memorandum of 1908 , Scott presented his view that man @-@ hauling to the South Pole was impossible and that motor traction was needed . Snow vehicles did not yet exist however , and so his engineer Reginald Skelton developed the idea of a caterpillar track for snow surfaces . In the middle of 1909 Scott realised that motors were unlikely to get him all the way to the Pole , and decided additionally to take horses ( based on Shackleton 's near success in attaining the Pole , using ponies ) , and dogs and skis after consultation with Nansen during trials of the motors in Norway in March 1910 . Man @-@ hauling would still be needed on the Polar Plateau , on the assumption that motors and animals could not ascend the crevassed Beardmore Glacier . 
 Dog expert Cecil Meares was going to Siberia to select the dogs , and Scott ordered that , while he was there , he should deal with the purchase of Manchurian ponies . Meares was not an experienced horse @-@ dealer , and the ponies he chose proved mostly of poor quality , and ill @-@ suited to prolonged Antarctic work . Meanwhile , Scott also recruited Bernard Day , from Shackleton 's expedition , as his motor expert . 
 = = = First season = = = 
 On 15 June 1910 , Scott 's ship Terra Nova , an old converted whaler , set sail from Cardiff , south Wales . Scott meanwhile was fundraising in Britain and joined the ship later in South Africa . Arriving in Melbourne , Australia in October 1910 , Scott received a telegram from Amundsen stating : " Beg leave to inform you Fram proceeding Antarctic Amundsen " , possibly indicating that Scott faced a race to the pole . 
 The expedition suffered a series of early misfortunes which hampered the first season 's work and impaired preparations for the main polar march . On its journey from New Zealand to the Antarctic , Terra Nova nearly sank in a storm and was then trapped in pack ice for 20 days , far longer than other ships had experienced , which meant a late @-@ season arrival and less time for preparatory work before the Antarctic winter . At Cape Evans , Antarctica , one of the motor sledges was lost during its unloading from the ship , breaking through the sea ice and sinking . Deteriorating weather conditions and weak , <unk> ponies affected the initial depot @-@ laying journey , so that the expedition 's main supply point , One Ton Depot , was laid 35 miles ( 56 km ) north of its planned location at 80 ° S. Lawrence Oates , in charge of the ponies , advised Scott to kill ponies for food and advance the depot to 80 ° S , which Scott refused to do . Oates is reported as saying to Scott , " Sir , I 'm afraid you 'll come to regret not taking my advice . " Four ponies died during this journey either from the cold or because they slowed the team down so they were shot . 
 On its return to base , the expedition learned of the presence of Amundsen , camped with his crew and a large contingent of dogs in the Bay of Whales , 200 miles ( 320 km ) to their east . Scott conceded that his ponies would not be able to start early enough in the season to compete with Amundsen 's cold @-@ tolerant dog teams for the pole , and also acknowledged that the Norwegian 's base was closer to the pole by 60 miles . Wilson was more hopeful , whereas Gran shared Scott 's concern . Shortly afterwards , the death toll among the ponies increased to six , three drowning when sea @-@ ice unexpectedly disintegrated , casting in doubt the possibility of reaching the pole at all . However , during the 1911 winter Scott 's confidence increased ; on 2 August , after the return of a three @-@ man party from their winter journey to Cape Crozier , Scott wrote , " I feel sure we are as near perfection as experience can direct " . 
 = = = Journey to the Pole = = = 
 Scott outlined his plans for the southern journey to the entire shore party , leaving open who would form the final polar team , according to their performance during the polar travel . Eleven days before Scott 's teams set off towards the pole , Scott gave the dog driver Meares the following written orders at Cape Evans dated 20 October 1911 to secure Scott 's speedy return from the pole using dogs : 
 About the first week of February I should like you to start your third journey to the South , the object being to hasten the return of the third Southern unit [ the polar party ] and give it a chance to catch the ship . The date of your departure must depend on news received from returning units , the extent of the depot of dog food you have been able to leave at One Ton Camp , the state of the dogs , etc ... It looks at present as though you should aim at meeting the returning party about March 1 in Latitude 82 or 82 @.@ 30 
 The march south began on 1 November 1911 , a caravan of mixed transport groups ( motors , dogs , horses ) , with loaded sledges , travelling at different rates , all designed to support a final group of four men who would make a dash for the Pole . The southbound party steadily reduced in size as successive support teams turned back . Scott reminded the returning Atkinson of the order " to take the two dog @-@ teams south in the event of Meares having to return home , as seemed likely " . By 4 January 1912 , the last two four @-@ man groups had reached 87 ° 34 ′ S. Scott announced his decision : five men ( Scott , Edward Wilson , Henry Bowers , Lawrence Oates and Edgar Evans ) would go forward , the other three ( Teddy Evans , William Lashly and Tom Crean ) would return . The chosen group marched on , reaching the Pole on 17 January 1912 , only to find that Amundsen had preceded them by five weeks . Scott 's anguish is indicated in his diary : " The worst has happened " ; " All the day dreams must go " ; " Great God ! This is an awful place " . 
 = = = Last march = = = 
 The deflated party began the 800 @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 300 km ) return journey on 19 January . " I 'm afraid the return journey is going to be dreadfully tiring and monotonous " , wrote Scott on that day . However , the party made good progress despite poor weather , and had completed the Polar Plateau stage of their journey , approximately 300 miles ( 500 km ) , by 7 February . In the following days , as the party made the 100 @-@ mile ( 160 km ) descent of the Beardmore Glacier , the physical condition of Edgar Evans , which Scott had noted with concern as early as 23 January , declined sharply . A fall on 4 February had left Evans " dull and incapable " , and on 17 February , after another fall , he died near the glacier foot . 
 Meanwhile , back at Cape Evans , the Terra Nova arrived at the beginning of February , and Atkinson decided to unload the supplies from the ship with his own men rather than set out south with the dogs to meet Scott as ordered . When Atkinson finally did leave south for the planned rendezvous with Scott , he encountered the scurvy @-@ ridden Edward ( " Teddy " ) Evans who needed his urgent medical attention . Atkinson therefore tried to send the experienced navigator Wright south to meet Scott , but chief meteorologist Simpson declared he needed Wright for scientific work . Atkinson then decided to send the short @-@ sighted Cherry @-@ Garrard on 25 February , who was not able to navigate , only as far as One Ton depot ( which is within sight of Mount Erebus ) , effectively cancelling Scott 's orders for meeting him at latitude 82 or 82 @.@ 30 on 1 March . 
 On the return journey from the Pole , Scott reached the 82 @.@ 30 ° S meeting point for the dog teams , three days ahead of schedule , noting in his diary for 27 February 1912 " We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs , where and when , etc . It is a critical position . We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot , but there is a horrid element of doubt . " By 10 March the temperature had dropped unexpectedly to below − 40 ° C ( − 40 ° F ) , and it became evident the dog teams were not coming : " The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed . Meares [ the dog @-@ driver ] had a bad trip home I suppose . It 's a miserable jumble . " With 400 miles ( 670 km ) still to travel across the Ross Ice Shelf , Scott 's party 's prospects steadily worsened as , with deteriorating weather , a puzzling lack of fuel in the depots , hunger and exhaustion , they struggled northward . In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer , dated 16 March , Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams : " We very nearly came through , and it 's a pity to have missed it , but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark . No @-@ one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support . " On the same day , Oates , whose toes had become frostbitten , voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death . Scott wrote that Oates ' last words were " I am just going outside and may be some time " . 
 After walking 20 miles farther despite Scott 's toes now becoming frostbitten , the three remaining men made their final camp on 19 March , 11 miles ( 18 km ) short of One Ton Depot . The next day a fierce blizzard prevented their making any progress . During the next nine days , as their supplies ran out , and with storms still raging outside the tent , Scott and his companions wrote their farewell letters . Scott gave up his diary after 23 March , save for a final entry on 29 March , with its concluding words : " Last entry . For God 's sake look after our people " . He left letters to Wilson 's mother , Bowers ' mother , a string of notables including his former commander Sir George Egerton , his own mother and his wife . He also wrote his " Message To The Public " , primarily a vindication of the expedition 's organisation and conduct in which the party 's failure is attributed to weather and other misfortunes , but ending on an inspirational note , with these words : 
 We took risks , we knew we took them ; things have come out against us , and therefore we have no cause for complaint , but bow to the will of Providence , determined still to do our best to the last ... Had we lived , I should have had a tale to tell of the hardihood , endurance , and courage of my companions which would have stirred the heart of every Englishman . These rough notes and our dead bodies must tell the tale , but surely , surely , a great rich country like ours will see that those who are dependent on us are properly provided for . 
 Scott is presumed to have died on 29 March 1912 , or possibly one day later . The positions of the bodies in the tent when it was discovered eight months later suggested that Scott was the last of the three to die . 
 The bodies of Scott and his companions were discovered by a search party on 12 November 1912 and their records retrieved . Their final camp became their tomb ; a high cairn of snow was erected over it , topped by a roughly fashioned cross . In January 1913 , before Terra Nova left for home , a large wooden cross was made by the ship 's carpenters , inscribed with the names of the lost party and Tennyson 's line from his poem Ulysses : " To strive , to seek , to find , and not to yield " , and was erected as a permanent memorial on Observation Hill , overlooking Hut Point . 
 A century of storms and snow have covered the cairn and tent , which are now encased in the Ross Ice Shelf as it inches towards the Ross Sea . In 2001 glaciologist Charles R. Bentley estimated that the tent with the bodies was under about 75 feet ( 23 m ) of ice and about 30 miles ( 48 km ) from the point where they died ; he speculated that in about 275 years the bodies would reach the Ross Sea , and perhaps float away inside an iceberg .

 The world was informed of the tragedy when Terra Nova reached Oamaru , New Zealand , on 10 February 1913 . Within days , Scott became a national icon . A nationalistic spirit was aroused ; the London Evening News called for the story to be read to schoolchildren throughout the land , to coincide with the memorial service at St Paul 's Cathedral on 14 February . Robert Baden @-@ Powell , founder of the Boy Scouts Association , asked : " Are Britons going downhill ? No ! ... There is plenty of pluck and spirit left in the British after all . Captain Scott and Captain Oates have shown us that " . Eleven @-@ year @-@ old Mary Steel wrote a poem which ended : 
 Though naught but a simple cross 
 Now marks those heroes ' grave , 
 Their names will live forever ! 
 Oh England , Land of the Brave ! 
 The survivors of the expedition were suitably honoured on their return , with polar medals and promotions for the naval personnel . In place of the knighthood that might have been her husband 's had he survived , Kathleen Scott was granted the rank and precedence of a widow of a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath . In 1922 , she married Edward Hilton Young , later Lord Kennet ( she becoming Lady Kennet ) , and remained a doughty defender of Scott 's reputation until her death , aged 69 , in 1947 . 
 An article in The Times , reporting on the glowing tributes paid to Scott in the New York press , claimed that both Amundsen and Shackleton were " [ amazed ] to hear that such a disaster could overtake a well @-@ organized expedition " . On learning the details of Scott 's death , Amundsen is reported as saying , " I would gladly forgo any honour or money if thereby I could have saved Scott his terrible death " . Scott was much the better wordsmith of the two , and the story that spread throughout the world was largely that told by him , with Amundsen 's victory reduced in the eyes of many to an unsporting stratagem . 
 The response to Scott 's final plea on behalf of the dependents of the dead was enormous by the standards of the day . The Mansion House Scott Memorial Fund closed at £ 75 @,@ 000 ( 2009 approximation £ 5 @.@ 5 million ) . This was not equally distributed ; Scott 's widow , son , mother and sisters received a total of £ 18 @,@ 000 ( £ 1 @.@ 3 million ) . Wilson 's widow got £ 8 @,@ 500 ( £ 600 @,@ 000 ) and Bowers 's mother £ 4 @,@ 500 ( £ 330 @,@ 000 ) . Edgar Evans 's widow , children and mother received £ 1 @,@ 500 ( £ 109 @,@ 000 ) between them . 
 In the dozen years following the disaster , more than 30 monuments and memorials were set up in Britain alone . These ranged from simple relics ( Scott 's sledging flag in Exeter Cathedral ) to the foundation of the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge . Many more were established in other parts of the world , including a statue crafted by his widow for his New Zealand base in Christchurch . 
 = = = Modern reaction = = = 
 Scott 's reputation survived the period after World War II , beyond the 50th anniversary of his death . In 1948 , the film Scott of the Antarctic was released in cinemas and was the third most popular film in Britain the following year . It portrays the team spirit of the expedition and the harsh Antarctic environment , but also includes critical scenes such as Scott regarding his broken down motors and ruefully remembering Nansen 's advice to take only dogs . Evans and Cherry @-@ Garrard were the only surviving expedition members to refuse participation in the film , but both re @-@ published their respective books in its wake . 
 In 1966 , Reginald Pound , the first biographer given access to Scott 's original sledging journal , revealed personal failings which cast a new light on Scott , although Pound continued to endorse his heroism , writing of " a splendid sanity that would not be subdued " . Within the following decade , further books appeared , each of which to some degree challenged the prevailing public perception . The most critical of these was David Thomson 's Scott 's Men ( 1977 ) ; in Thomson 's view , Scott was not a great man , " at least , not until near the end " ; his planning is described as " haphazard " and " flawed " , his leadership characterised by lack of foresight . Thus by the late 1970s , in Jones 's words , " Scott 's complex personality had been revealed and his methods questioned " . 
 In 1979 came the most sustained attack on Scott , from Roland Huntford 's dual biography Scott and Amundsen in which Scott is depicted as a " heroic bungler " . Huntford 's thesis had an immediate impact , becoming the contemporary orthodoxy . Even Scott 's heroism in the face of death was challenged ; Huntford sees Scott 's Message to the Public as a deceitful self @-@ justification from a man who had led his comrades to their deaths . After Huntford 's book , several other mostly negative books about Captain Scott were published ; Francis <unk> , in a 1996 history not wholly antagonistic to Scott , refers to " devastating evidence of bungling " , concluding that " Scott doomed his companions , then covered his tracks with rhetoric " . Travel writer Paul Theroux summarised Scott as " confused and demoralised ... an enigma to his men , unprepared and a bungler " . This decline in Scott 's reputation was accompanied by a corresponding rise in that of his erstwhile rival Shackleton , at first in the United States but eventually in Britain as well . A 2002 nationwide poll in the United Kingdom to discover the " 100 Greatest Britons " showed Shackleton in eleventh place , Scott well down the list at 54th . 
 The 21st century has seen a shift of opinion in Scott 's favour , in what cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski calls " a revision of the revisionist view " . Meteorologist Susan Solomon 's 2001 account The Coldest March ties the fate of Scott 's party to the extraordinarily adverse Barrier weather conditions of February and March 1912 rather than to personal or organisational failings , although Solomon accepts the validity of some of the criticisms of Scott . 
 In 2004 polar explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes published a biography which was a strong defence of Scott and an equally forthright rebuttal of Huntford ; the book is dedicated " To the Families of the <unk> Dead " . Fiennes was later criticised by the reviewer of another book for the personal nature of his attacks on Huntford , and for his apparent assumption that his own experiences as a polar explorer gave him unique authority . 
 In 2005 David Crane published a new Scott biography which , according to Barczewski , goes some way towards an assessment of Scott " free from the baggage of earlier interpretations " . What has happened to Scott 's reputation , Crane argues , derives from the way the world has changed since the heroic myth was formed : " It is not that we see him differently from the way they [ his contemporaries ] did , but that we see him the same , and instinctively do not like it . " Crane 's main achievement , according to Barczewski , is the restoration of Scott 's humanity , " far more effectively than either Fiennes 's stridency or Solomon 's scientific data . " Daily Telegraph columnist Jasper Rees , likening the changes in explorers ' reputations to climatic variations , suggests that " in the current Antarctic weather report , Scott is enjoying his first spell in the sun for twenty @-@ five years " . The New York Times Book Review was more critical , pointing out Crane 's support for Scott 's discredited claims regarding the circumstances of the freeing of the Discovery from the pack ice , and concluded " For all the many attractions of his book , David Crane offers no answers that convincingly exonerate Scott from a significant share of responsibility for his own demise . " 
 In 2012 , Karen May published her discovery that Scott had issued written orders , before his march to the Pole , for Meares to meet the returning party with dog @-@ teams , in contrast to Huntford 's assertion in 1979 that Scott issued those vital instructions only as a casual oral order to Evans during the march to the Pole . According to May , " Huntford 's scenario was pure invention based on an error ; it has led a number of polar historians down a regrettable false trail " .

 = George Madison = 
 George Madison ( June 1763 – October 14 , 1816 ) was the sixth Governor of Kentucky . He was the first governor of Kentucky to die in office , serving only a few weeks in 1816 . Little is known of Madison 's early life . He was a member of the influential Madison family of Virginia , and was a second cousin to President James Madison . He served with distinction in three wars – the Revolutionary War , Northwest Indian War , and War of 1812 . He was twice wounded in the Northwest Indian War , and in the War of 1812 he was taken prisoner following the Battle of Frenchtown in Michigan . 
 Madison 's political experience before becoming governor consisted of a twenty @-@ year tenure as state auditor . Although his military service made him extremely popular in Kentucky , he sought no higher office until the citizens insisted he run for governor in 1816 . James Johnson , his only challenger in the race , dropped out early due to Madison 's overwhelming popularity , and Madison was elected without opposition . A few weeks later , he became the first Kentucky governor to die in office . Opponents of his lieutenant governor , Gabriel Slaughter , mounted a popular but unsuccessful challenge to Slaughter 's succeeding Madison in office . 
 = = Early life = = 
 George Madison was born in June 1763 in the portion of Augusta County , Virginia that eventually became Rockingham County . [ a ] His parents were John and Agatha ( Strother ) Madison . His brother James became the Episcopal bishop of Virginia and the president of the College of William & Mary . Another brother was Captain Thomas Madison . They were second cousins to President James Madison . 
 Madison was educated in the local schools and also received instruction at home . Before he was legally old enough to enlist , he entered the Continental Army as a private during the Revolutionary War . 
 It is not known when Madison moved to Kentucky , but land records in Lincoln County indicate he and his brother Gabriel were there by at least 1784 . He married Jane Smith and they had four children – Agatha , William , Myra , and George . [ b ] Jane Smith @-@ Madison died in 1811 . 
 = = Service in the Northwest Indian War = = 
 Madison served with the Kentucky militia during the Northwest Indian War . He was a subaltern in Arthur St. Clair 's army in the American defeat at the Battle of the Wabash on November 4 , 1791 . During the retreat , a soldier named William Kennan found Madison sitting on a log . Kennan was being pursued by Indians and admonished Madison to run , but Madison , who was already known to be of frail constitution , stood to reveal that he had been badly wounded and was bleeding profusely . Kennan quickly retrieved an abandoned horse he had seen ; he helped Madison astride the horse , and they both escaped . 
 Later in the war , Madison served under Major John Adair . On November 5 , 1792 , Adair 's men were encamped near Fort St. Clair when they were ambushed by an Indian force under the command of Little Turtle . Adair ordered a retreat , then rallied his men and divided them into three groups . He ordered those under Madison to turn the enemy 's flank , but they failed and Madison was wounded again in this battle . Following this , Adair withdrew to Fort St. Clair . In Adair 's report to Brigadier General James Wilkinson , he wrote : " Madison 's bravery and conduct need no comment ; they are well @-@ known . " 
 = = Political career = = 
 Governor Isaac Shelby appointed Madison as Auditor of Public Accounts on March 7 , 1796 . He served in this capacity in state government for twenty years . He never sought a higher office but 19th @-@ century historian Lewis Collins said that " there was no office within the gift of the people which he could not have easily attained , without the slightest solicitation . " In 1800 , Madison was appointed as a trustee of the Kentucky Seminary in Franklin County . On December 5 , 1806 , he served on a grand jury in the case of Aaron Burr 's conduct ; they did not find grounds for treason charges . Madison was appointed director of the Bank of Kentucky later that year . 
 During the War of 1812 , Governor Shelby called for volunteers to serve in the Army of the Northwest . Colonel John Allen raised a regiment , and Madison was commissioned as his second @-@ in @-@ command . The regiment , known as the 1st Rifle Regiment of Kentucky Volunteers , fought under James Winchester at the Battle of Frenchtown . Winchester was captured by General Henry Procter , but about four hundred men under Madison repelled several charges by the British . Madison 's men believed they had won the victory when they observed a white flag in the midst of the British force , but the flag was being waved by Winchester as an order for Madison 's force to surrender . 
 When Madison discovered that Winchester was waving the flag , he refused the order to surrender on grounds that , as a prisoner , Winchester had no authority to issue it . Proctor demanded Madison 's unconditional surrender , but Madison insisted that the terms of surrender include Proctor 's protection of the American prisoners from the Indian allies of the British . Proctor initially balked at anything but an unconditional surrender , but after Madison 's promise that the Americans would " sell their lives as dearly as possible " , Proctor acquiesced . 
 Proctor had taken as many prisoners as he had soldiers , and had little power to enforce the terms he had agreed to . The American non @-@ commissioned officers were paroled to return home . Madison and the other officers were taken to Fort Malden , then on to a prison in Quebec . The American wounded who could not march were left under the care of American physicians . Shortly after the battle , the Indians looted the American provisions , which included a large quantity of whiskey . Drunk and violent , they slaughtered many of the American wounded in what became known as the Massacre of the River Raisin . 
 Madison was freed from prison a year after his capture , as part of a prisoner exchange . He returned to Kentucky following his release and was honored at a public dinner on September 6 , 1814 . In 1816 , he resigned as auditor of public accounts due to failing health . But , submitting to public demand , he became a candidate for governor later that year . James Johnson , the other candidate for office , withdrew from the race due to Madison 's popularity , thus the latter was elected without opposition . 
 = = Death and aftermath = = 
 Madison traveled to Blue Lick Springs for his health soon after the election , but was too weak to return to Frankfort for the inauguration . A Bourbon County justice of the peace administered the oath of office on September 5 , 1816 at the springs . Madison 's only official act of office was the appointment of Colonel Charles S. Todd as secretary of state . He died on October 14 , 1816 , just weeks into his term , the first governor of the state to die in office . He is buried in Frankfort Cemetery . 
 Opponents of his lieutenant governor , Gabriel Slaughter , immediately challenged his ascendancy to the governorship . They claimed that a governor should not be allowed to serve without having been elected to that office by the people . A measure calling for a special gubernatorial election easily passed the state House of Representatives , but failed in the senate by a vote of 18 – 14 . Slaughter was allowed to exercise the powers of the governor , but many government officials and citizens of the state refused to call him by that title , opting for " acting governor " or " lieutenant governor " instead .

In the episode , a huge horde of walkers invades the Greene farm , chasing Rick Grimes ( Andrew Lincoln ) and Hershel 's groups off the premises . Meanwhile , Andrea ( Laurie Holden ) is separated from the group , leaving her to fight off the same walkers that attacked Hershel 's farm . 
 Such themes as romance , death , and survival are prevalent throughout " Beside the Dying Fire " .

 = = Plot = = 
 Following the trail of a helicopter overhead , a massive herd of walkers begins to form and migrates from the city to the countryside . They come to rest in the woods outside Hershel 's farm . The herd follows the sound of a gunshot and discover the survivors ' location . 
 Rick Grimes ( Andrew Lincoln ) and his son Carl ( Chandler Riggs ) return to the Greene farm , where Carl asks his father about the death of Shane Walsh ( Jon Bernthal ) , but before Rick is able to answer , he spots the large horde of walkers and the two flee to the barn . Daryl Dixon ( Norman Reedus ) and Glenn ( Steven Yeun ) report the death and reanimation of Randall ( Michael Zegen ) but also that he turned without being bit . Lori Grimes ( Sarah Wayne Callies ) begs Daryl to go out and search for Rick and Shane — before he can however , the group spots the invading herd and are forced to mobilize . 
 The group rations their weapons and their vehicles with the objective to kill as many of the herd as they can , Hershel ( Scott Wilson ) intends to defend his land at the risk of his own life . Rick and Carl corral the walkers in the barn and set it ablaze . After spotting the fire , Jimmy ( James Allen McCune ) drives the RV near the barn and allows Rick and Carl to safely escape the burning barn , but he is killed when the walkers overrun the RV . Andrea ( Laurie Holden ) and Theodore " T @-@ Dog " Douglas ( IronE Singleton ) realize that their plan is not working , and decide to flee instead of fight . Lori and the other women flee the house , without Hershel who can 't be budged to leave his property . Along the way , Patricia ( Jane McNeill ) is killed and Carol Peletier ( Melissa McBride ) is cornered by the walkers . Lori and Beth Greene ( Emily Kinney ) are picked up by T @-@ Dog while Andrea leaves to help Carol escape her predicament . Rick escapes with Carl and convinces Hershel to abandon his land . Glenn and Maggie Greene ( Lauren Cohan ) flee the scene and Carol is ultimately rescued by Daryl . In the chaos , Andrea is the only survivor left behind , but she manages to escape the farm on foot . Fleeing to the woods , Andrea defends herself against the walkers until she runs out of ammunition . Exhausted and defenseless , she is miraculously saved by a mysterious hooded figure who has two armless walker pets and wields a katana . 
 The survivors eventually regroup and report their casualties ( Shane , Patricia , Jimmy witnessed as dead , and Andrea who is deemed to be a lost cause ) . They press on , avoiding the main roads , until one of the vehicles runs out of gas . Rick assures the group that they can start anew elsewhere . When Daryl questions why Randall turned even though he wasn 't bitten , Rick reveals what Dr. Edwin Jenner ( Noah Emmerich ) whispered in his ear : they are all infected carriers of the walker pathogen . Rick 's held secret is met with apprehension from the group . Rick also confesses to Lori about the true events surrounding Shane 's death including Carl shooting the reanimated Shane . His lack of remorse in claiming he wanted Shane dead and that Carl shot his reanimated body leaves Lori visibly disturbed . Over time , the group 's faith in Rick dwindles with the exception of Daryl and Hershel who trust Rick 's judgment . A noise echoing in the distance places the group on high alert , but Rick does not allow anyone to investigate . Carol urges Rick to take action , causing Rick to snap , saying that he never asked that he be put in charge , and blurting out that he had killed Shane for their sake causing Carl to be upset . He dares anyone to leave the safety of the camp . When nobody leaves he issues a final warning : " If you 're staying , this isn 't a democracy anymore , " establishing his position as leader of the group . Afterwards it is shown that the group is unknowingly camped near a prison center .

 " Beside the Dying Fire " was directed by Ernest Dickerson and written by creator Robert Kirkman and showrunner Glen Mazzara . Mazzara teased the episode in a conference call with various journalists : " We 're proud of this finale , we 've been building to it all season , and we can 't wait for you to see it . [ ... ] There 's more bloodshed coming . They thought they were safe on this farm , they were wrong . [ ... ] We 're on a killing spree here . [ ... ] There are answers about the nature of the virus in the finale . [ ... ] I will guarantee people will watch this finale and want to know what comes next . People will have a lot of questions , but in a good way . " 
 The episode filmed for eight days . In one sequence , Carl Grimes sparks up a cigarette lighter and drops it onto a horde of walkers after Rick creates a diversion to distract the walkers . Greg Nicotero , the special effect director for The Walking Dead , used black panels to capture the elements of the fire ; this enabled them to edit the flames onto the walkers . To reduce the chances of getting burned , the stuntmen put on several layers of flame retardant suits . The first layer consisted of a dry Nomex undergarment ; this was followed by several layers of Nomex clothing that were gelled . Since the sequence was conducted on multiple occasions , the stuntmen were coated with gel containing cationic polymers . The last layer was a raincoat , which would separate the gel from the stuntmen 's clothing and allowed them to be engulfed in flames for several seconds without injury . 
 " Beside the Dying Fire " features the deaths of Patricia and Jimmy , who were both consumed by walkers . Alongside the deaths of the aforementioned characters , the episode 's script initially called for the deaths of Hershel , as well as Shane Walsh and Randall , both of whom had died in the previous installment . Since Kirkman felt that there was a lot of potential development in Hershel , his death was scrapped from the script . Although plans to write off the character commenced earlier in the season , Mazzara opined that his hypothetical death would have carried no emotional resonance . " The plan was always to whack Hershel , and I actually told Scott Wilson , ' Thanks for everything you 've done , but in the next script we 're going to kill off your character . ' We started writing that and it felt like Hershel 's death was playing as a plot device and we were getting no emotional resonance . It was just playing as a gratuitous death . This was one of those examples where we won 't play a shocking death for the sense of death ; we have to get something out of it . We got nothing out of it . If you look at the shot of Hershel looking back and seeing that barn burning and his farm completely lost to the zombies , that shot was well worth it because we see the farm was really a character and you can only see that through Hershel 's eyes . So it was the right call to keep him alive . " 
 The night on which " Beside the Dying Fire " was so cold , the editors had to digitally remove vapor expelled by the walkers . 
 This episode introduces the character Michonne , a protagonist in the comic series of the same name who is portrayed by <unk> Gurira . Gurira was cast as part of the series a week before the broadcasting of " Beside the Dying Fire , " although rumors of introducing Michonne circulated months prior to the season finale . Kirkman admitted that he was a fan of her work in the HBO drama series Treme . Rutina Wesley , who played Tara Thornton in True Blood , was rumored to be considered for the role of Michonne , although Kirkman stated that she was never involved in the auditioning process . " It was a lot of actresses . The True Blood actress , I don 't know that she was even available ; I think she 's still on True Blood . I don 't know where that rumor came from , but to my knowledge , she was never involved . " 
 In the conclusion of " Beside the Dying Fire , " a large prison is seen in the background hovering over the survivors ' temporary settlement . Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence , which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location . " There ’ s something really powerful there that could become , sort of like a heartbeat @-@ like theme for this location , which is kind of similar to what I had in mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there , " he asserted . " I had been thinking about it , there ’ s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it , and I don ’ t want to do that . But , we ’ ll see . I mean it really depends on where they take the show . It ’ s a little early to think about it , but I ’ m definitely thinking about it anyway . "

 " Beside the Dying Fire " is seen as a transitional stage for several characters in the series . The transformation of Rick Grimes to a dark character continues in the episode . He has changed from the person who wanted to save Merle ( in Season 1 ) and find Sophia ( first half of season 2 ) , to the person who is willing to abandon any hope of finding Andrea . Furthermore , Rick yells at his group for being unappreciative of his sacrifices as a leader . This backlash and hostility has been interpreted as a foreshadowing event for future development for The Walking Dead . " Rick is clearly in a much darker place now than he was at the start of the season , " concluded Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich . In a similar fashion , Lori Grimes is furious at Rick after he admits that he killed Shane Walsh . According to Kirkman , " it looks pretty clear that he has lost [ Lori and Carl ] by doing this " at the end of " Beside the Dying Fire . " In response to the interactions between Rick and Lori , he opined : " I think he feels that he has sacrificed for this group , and that sacrifice hasn ’ t really been appreciated . His confession to Lori did not get the reaction that he had hoped . He thought she would be supportive . Instead , she reacts in a particular way that he feels is hatred and disgust . I think that ’ s really affecting him . Let 's not forget : This is taking place hours after he murdered his best friend . So he is still reeling . He ’ s trying to keep that a secret . He opens his heart to his wife , and it doesn ’ t go well . So I think that he ’ s just done with these people . I think he doesn ’ t want to be the leader . As he says : If they don ’ t like it , they ’ re free to leave . " 
 The episode flashbacks to the previous developments of several storylines throughout the season , including the love triangle between Rick , Shane , and Lori . Mazzara iterated that upon hearing of her husband 's revelations , Lori was conflicted with several issues . " All of that is going through Lori 's mind . Rick murdered Shane and she did confess she had feelings for Shane . Her son was a part of it . They 're all infected . Is her baby infected ? We 're out on the road , where is she going to give birth ? What happens if the baby dies ? What happens if she dies ? All of these questions are going through her head . The thing that affects her most is that she played a role in Shane 's death . She put those two men at odds , she whispered in Rick 's ear and then she talked to Shane at the windmill . She realizes that this has been over her , and in a sense she has been an active participant in Shane 's death . So she can blame Rick for that , but she 's horrified by her own culpability . " 
 " Beside the Dying Fire " reminiscences to the first season finale , " TS @-@ 19 , " in which Rick reveals that everyone in the group is infected with the virus . Although Kirkman described his actions as " exhibiting good leadership skills , " Mazzara said that the group began to question Rick 's capabilities as a leader . " He presents them with a very pragmatic option : If you don 't like it , get the hell out and there are no takers . At the end of the finale , the true horror is Rick when he says , ' It ain 't a democracy anymore . ' That 's the true horror . " 
 Themes of social <unk> and survival are prevalent throughout " Beside the Dying Fire . " In the episode , Andrea is separated from the group and is forced to fend herself against the horde of walkers that invaded Hershel 's farm . Mazzara felt that separating Andrea from her group would be essential in exploring her character in @-@ depth , as he stated that she was viewed in the light of other characters on The Walking Dead .

 Rob Salem of Toronto Star said that " fans who have been complaining about this season ’ s relative complacency [ ... ] finally got their gore and more when the farm was overrun by suddenly , strangely single @-@ minded walkers . " Pamela Mitchell of Houston Chronicle commented that " Beside the Dying Fire " was the most eventful episode of the season , while Digital Spy 's Morgan Jeffery thought that " every single major character gets their moment to shine " ; " Epic , action @-@ packed , emotional — ' Beside the Dying Fire ' is great television , " she concluded . TV Guide television critic Michael Logan affirmed that the season finale " was so scary and shock @-@ a @-@ minute outrageous that it nearly made our heads explode . " In his A – review , Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club said that " Beside the Dying Fire " adequately accomplished what he was hoping for . He wrote , " We 're finally off Hershel 's farm , in about the most definitive way imaginable : The barn has been burned , and the house itself is overrun by a herd of ' walkers ' . " New York 's Starlee Kine adulated the installment , and asserted that it was comparable to episodes of The Walking Dead 's first season . " It ’ s just amazing how much smoother the plot holes go down when something is actually happening on this show . For the first time since last season , I felt engrossed enough to not be consumed with all the small things this show gets wrong . Up until this episode , the majority of this season has consisted exclusively of small things : petty dramas , misdirected stakes , so much stalling . I ’ m not sure I can go so far as to say that it got everything right with this one , but at least it was entertaining and the nonstop action felt like content instead of just bookends . " Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that it was the closest the program " ever resembled the climax of a George Romero film . " Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that " Beside the Dying Fire " sufficiently encompassed a climax for its storylines , adding that it left the audience anticipating for future installments of the series . 
 Last night ’ s The Walking Dead season finale did that wonderfully , wrapping up several loose threads before pointing the compass directly at the heart of Season 3 . In a closing shot similar to that of this season ’ s penultimate episode , the producers literally glanced over the horizon at a giant prison , which I ’ m willing to bet elicited one of two reactions . If you ’ ve read the graphic novels , you probably said , “ It ’ s about damn time ! , ” whereas if you ’ re a TWD novice , your take was probably some variation on “ What the f — was that ? ” This is the balance the producers wanted to strike , and they did it brilliantly . 
 Gina McIntyre of Los Angeles Times said that the program delivered what she described as a " blood bath , " and Aaron <unk> of The Wall Street Journal further analyzed that the episode followed a dark and frenetic convention " with flare . " The Washington Post commentator Jen Chaney opined that " Beside the Dying Fire " evoked elements of various films of George Romero , as well as the historical epic film Gone with the Wind ( 1939 ) . Writing for Paste , Josh Jackson issued the episode an 8 @.@ 8 out of 10 rating , signifying a " commendable " rating . " ' Beside the Dying Fire ' wasted no time getting straight to the action , assuming a season ’ s worth of character development was more than enough . " The Huffington Post 's Maureen Ryan echoed synonymous sentiments , ultimately declaring that the telecast was the best since the series ' pilot episode , " Days Gone Bye . " Ryan summated : " The first two acts of The Walking Dead Season 2 finale were full of excitement , honest to God suspense and characters who came up with pretty decent plans on the fly . When the <unk> finally hit the fan at Hershel Greene 's farm , my pulse quickened and I found myself wondering and even caring about the survival of characters who 'd done little more than irritate me for weeks . " Julia Rhodes from California Literary Review uttered that the show returned to form in " Beside the Dying Fire , " while Buddy TV writer Megan Cole summed up the episode as " intense . " 
 The character development of Andrea produced uniform praise among critics . Jackson felt that it served as the episode 's highlight , and further assessed that she emulated actress Linda Hamilton . " After a season of whining , there had to have been at least a few fans pulling for the walkers in her early scenes , but she quickly became Linda Hamilton @-@ badass , <unk> zombies with her foot , " he said . Likewise , Kine asserted that " the badass she has tried so hard to convince us all she is finally came across . " Ryan thought that Andrea 's struggle to survive was a strong way to build up the exodus of the group . She spoke of her scene with Michonne : " She 'd fought so hard to live that I wanted Andrea to fend off that final batch of walkers successfully . When it appeared she might not live , I was , quite rightly , on the edge of my seat . And the appearance of the caped figure — towing two armless walkers , no less — was as dramatic as could be . " 
 The gradual alteration of Rick was frequently mentioned in the critiques . Dan Hopper of Best Week Ever theorized that such a drastic transition was attributed by the death of his friend Shane . Halden proclaimed that the progression established a strong sense of direction for the character . " This is a definite direction . I ’ m not sure if the show ’ s going to make Rick an out @-@ and @-@ out monster , or if this is setting up some sort of redemptive arc for him in season three , but it ’ s a strong choice . The Walking Dead has tried to make us value this group of people , as if together , they mean more than they do alone . That hasn ’ t worked , so now it appears we ’ re going to try trial by fire . " By the end of " Beside the Dying Fire , " Ryan concluded that " Rick is becoming the leader he should have been from the start , and he 's being clear and upfront about his goals and leadership style . " 
 Commentators were divided with the interactions between Rick and his wife Lori . Although Ryan reacted positively to Lincoln 's performance , she affirmed that the contradictory nature of Lori almost ruined the scene . Similarly , Kine criticized Callies ' facial expressions during the sequence . Jackson wrote , " If that was a challenge from the writers , though , Sarah Wayne Callies has to feel like they 're just messing with her at this point . Her character , Lori , basically tells Rick that Shane needs to be put down , and then treats him like a monster when he ’ s forced to follow through with it . "

 F @-@ Zero X is a futuristic racing video game for the Nintendo 64 ( N64 ) console . Developed by Nintendo 's EAD division , it was released in Japan , North America , and Europe in 1998 . In 2000 , an expansion pack was exclusively released in Japan providing numerous extra features not in the original game . F @-@ Zero X was ported in 2004 to the iQue Player in China . The game was re @-@ released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan , Europe and in North America , in 2007 . To honor the 100th Virtual Console release in Europe , it became available on June 15 . 
 It was a sequel to the original 1990 F @-@ Zero game , and is the first F @-@ Zero installment to have featured 3D graphics . The game has a steep learning curve and its gameplay experience is similar to that of the original F @-@ Zero game . F @-@ Zero X introduced a " death race " mode and a random track generator called the " X Cup " . In the death race , the player 's objective is to annihilate the 29 other racers as speedily as possible , while the X @-@ Cup " creates " a different set of tracks each time played . 
 Critics generally praised F @-@ Zero X for its fast gameplay , abundance of courses and vehicles , track design , and maintaining a high framerate . However , the game has been widely criticized for its lack of graphical detail . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 F @-@ Zero X is a fast @-@ paced futuristic racing video game where thirty competitors race on high @-@ altitude circuits inside plasma @-@ powered <unk> in an intergalactic Grand Prix . Taking place after the original tournament was discontinued for several years due to the extreme danger of the sport , F @-@ Zero X begins after the Grand Prix is brought back with the rules and regulations revised under the same name as the video game . The tracks in the game include hills , loops , tunnels , corkscrews , and pipes . Players can drift into turns without losing momentum by using the control stick and trigger button . The game introduces 26 new vehicles , and reprises the 4 from the original F @-@ Zero game . Each has its own performance abilities affected by its size and weight , and a grip , boost , and durability trait graded on an A to E ( best to worst ) scale . Before a race , players are able to adjust a vehicle 's balance between maximum acceleration and maximum top speed . 
 Each machine has an energy meter , which serves two purposes . Firstly , it is a measurement of the machine 's health and is decreased , for example , when the machine hits another racer or the side of the track . The game introduces the ability to attack other racers by either utilizing a side or spin attack . Secondly , it is a boost meter used for manually boosting , usually starting with the second lap of a race . Energy can be replenished by driving over recharge strips , called " Pit Areas " , located at various points around the track . The amount of time spent in these areas is relative to amount of energy regenerated . There are also dash plates around the track that give a speed boost without using up any energy . 
 = = = Race modes = = = 
 F @-@ Zero X has five different gameplay modes : GP ( Grand Prix ) Race , Practice , Time Attack , Death Race , and VS Battle . In GP Race , the player races against 29 opponents through 3 laps of each track in a cup . Players get a certain number of points for finishing a track depending on where they placed , and the winner of the cup is the character who receives the most total points . If the player has a " spare machine " — the equivalent of an extra life — then falls off a track or runs out of energy , the race can be restarted . Each cup has four selectable difficulty levels : Novice , Standard , Expert , and Master . The higher the difficulty level selected , the tougher the opponents , and less spare machines the player starts with . Furthermore , the three cups initially available are ordered by increasing difficulty ( Jack , Queen and King respectively ) and have 6 tracks each . Eventually , the player can unlock the Joker Cup with its set of 6 tracks , followed by the X Cup . The X Cup is a set of 6 randomly generated tracks every time played . The randomized track elements lack loops and can be simplistic , but others are intricate . 
 There is a Practice mode which allows the player to practice any track with opponents . Time Attack lets the player choose a track and complete a 3 @-@ lap race in the shortest time possible . Transparent re @-@ enactments of Time Attack performances , or ghost data , from the player or game developer can be raced against . Up to 3 player @-@ contributed ghosts can be raced against simultaneously , but only one can be saved per track . Death Race has the player annihilating the 29 other racers as speedily as possible on a specialized course . There is no selectable difficulty level , or set amount of laps , but the boost is immediately available . Vs . Battle is the multiplayer mode where 2 to 4 players compete in a 3 @-@ lap race , and slots not in use by players can be operated by the artificial intelligence . A slot machine for those out of the race early will appear if the option is enabled . Players can adversely affect the energy levels of those still competing by matching symbols .

Soon after , IGN reported F @-@ Zero X consistently ran at 60 frames per second . Consequently , background detail and textures were lacking as well as polygon count on vehicles which lessen more so as they pass the player . They noted that " [ tracks ] hide most of the limited backgrounds with their girth and undulating nature which block out almost everything else .

 Overall , critical reception of F @-@ Zero X was positive ; the game has an aggregate average of 86 @.@ 93 % based on 15 reviews at Game Rankings , and a metascore of 85 at Metacritic . Critics generally praised F @-@ Zero X for its fast gameplay , abundance of courses and vehicles , keeping a high framerate with up to thirty racers on screen at the same time , and track design . However , the game has been widely criticized for its lack of graphical detail . Peer Schneider of IGN described the gameplay as " god @-@ like " , " hair @-@ splitting " speed ; and he considered the game to rival its predecessor Wave Race 64 with its " perfectly fine @-@ tuned controls and a fresh approach to racing " . The title received the Game of the Month award for November 1998 from Electronic Gaming Monthly . An editor stated " the graphics may be simple , but they 're smooth and the action is fast " . 
 Allgame called F @-@ Zero X as " certainly not up to Nintendo 's usual standards " in terms of detail and texture quality . GameSpot also criticized the game 's graphical detail , calling the low polygon count on the vehicles " particularly uninspiring " and saying that the " track detail is also very limited , giving the track a spartan feel to it " . Although the optimizations are strict , critics exalted the game for managing a steady rate of 60 frames per second , which some thought made up for the lack of graphical detail with little room for improvement . The Electric Playground found the framerate to give " the game a major boost in the feel department " making it " seem like your vehicle is bursting through the sound barrier " . According to GameSpot , F @-@ Zero X became the first racing game to run at 60 frames per second with up to 30 vehicles on screen at the same time , but in order to keep the frame rate , polygon counts on the vehicles , textures and track detail are sacrificed . 
 In regard to the music , EGM considered it " really good with some excellent remixes of the old F @-@ Zero tunes " , while CVG called the music dreadful . The Electric Playground thought it goes hand @-@ in @-@ hand to the simulation of speed in the game , but the reviewer commented " I wouldn 't in a million years buy music like this to listen to " . In GameSpot 's retrospective review , they gave it a 6 @.@ 5 / 10 calling it " the black sheep of the series " when compared with the other F @-@ Zero games in " visual style and technical flair " . IGN described F @-@ Zero X as an exceptional update to the original game that " only suffers under its generic look " . Peer Schneider believed that unlike the first game , F @-@ Zero X " is not about showing off graphics or sound capabilities -- it 's all about gameplay " . 
 Nintendo sold 383 @,@ 642 units of F @-@ Zero X in North America and 97 @,@ 684 units in Japan . In its first week of sale in Japan , 56 @,@ 457 copies were sold , but only about one fifth of that in the following week reportedly due to the Nintendo 64 having had a small dedicated fanbase there . 
 = = Expansion Kit = = 
 F @-@ Zero X Expansion Kit , released in Japan on April 21 , 2000 , is the first expansion disk for the 64DD , Nintendo 's disk drive peripheral for the Nintendo 64 . F @-@ Zero X was programmed with " 64DD hooks " , which allow it to detect whether the 64DD is connected and compatible expansion software is loaded . This allows the cartridge @-@ based game to be compatible with expansion disks such as track editors or course updates ; however , none of these were utilized outside Japan due to the 64DD 's commercial failure . Expansion Kit will only operate in conjunction with the cartridge of the original game . However , all of F @-@ Zero X 's regular features are accessible in addition to twelve new tracks , a car editor and a track creator . As the Expansion Kit benefits from a larger amount of storage on disk when compared to the original cartridge version , it includes new soundtracks in stereophonic sound as well as the entire collection of monaural audio tracks from the original game . 
 In addition to the two new cups , it is also possible to create custom cups . The disk can save up to a hundred tracks and up to three ghost racers per course . IGN singled out the track creator as the F @-@ Zero X Expansion Kit 's strongest feature since it is virtually the same tool the designers of F @-@ Zero X used for themselves to create the original circuits . The Car Editor offers a variety of options when creating a vehicle . Using a set of pre @-@ existing parts , the player must balance their creations ' settings and performance abilities before the machine is finished and named . The Track Editor is a detailed track creator that allows the player to design their own racing circuits . Using a cursor , the player can determine the basic layout of the track and also add points to it to create track elements such as curves and hills . Furthermore , numerous different properties like half pipes and cylinders , as well as numerous road surfaces , such as slip zones , can be added . The player can test the creation at any time and run practice laps .

 Lioba Fielding is one of the people behind " Planet B " , a virtual world which advertises itself as : " Where you can be whatever you want to be . " Planet B allows its users to download themselves onto it and play as a life @-@ size avatar in a 3D world designed to be as realistic as possible . Planet B contains various environments , including schools , the Wild West , and Ancient Rome . 
 Lioba commits suicide in the real world by throwing herself off a cliff , to the distress and horror of her boyfriend John Armstrong . John then downloads himself into Planet B and enters a section called " Golden Moments " which allows him to play the best moments of his life , but a technical fault results in him being forced to constantly watch Lioba 's funeral . John , along with his virtual hostess and guide Medley , discover that the problem revolves around Lioba . John then begins to see memories that are not his but Lioba 's . He therefore begins to believe that Lioba is still alive somewhere in Planet B. John and Medley decide to search Planet B in an attempt to find her by jumping into a rift in the system , taking part in the various games and worlds in the system as they go along . However , when they exit the rift , John is no longer his avatar , but himself with his DNA digitised . As a result , he feels everything in Planet B for real , and if he is killed in a game , he will really die . 
 Unknown to them , Lioba is indeed alive in Planet B. She is currently trying to rid the network of viruses . She does this with the help of Cerberus , a vicious antivirus programme designed to look like a cerberus who destroys viruses by ripping them to shreds . 
 John discovers that Medley is in fact a " Rogue avatar " - an advanced form of computer virus that can think for itself . Medley makes it her mission to become more human , to protect the other rogues and to make them as equal as humans . She learns that she is to lead the rogues to freedom from the corporation behind Planet B. Cerberus however , views Medley and the other rogues as viruses that must be deleted before they destroy Planet B and wants to hunt them down . In an attempt to track them , Lioba gets rid of her " Weaker " emotions to track the rogues , as rogues use them to feel emotion themselves . John gains access to them , but when he meets the colder , crueler Lioba , he wants to kill himself . However , John and Medley always teleport to safety before he goes through with it . 
 Lioba 's emotionless state causes her to act less rationally and as a result the corporation stop her . It is deemed that she has to be deleted . Before this happens , John manages to find her and give her back her emotions . They agree to leave Planet B and meet up in real life . However , after they do , Lioba becomes ill and goes into a hospital , where John discovers that Medley is one of the staff . John discovers that not only is he still in Planet B , but Lioba has no physical body so she cannot leave . Lioba 's illness comes from a patch designed to delete the rogues . John and Medley help to cure Lioba , and they unite in order to prevent more rogues from being destroyed . Cerberus then confronts them and battles with Medley , while John and Lioba flee to safety . 
 = = = Series 2 = = = 
 The second series takes place some time after the events of series one . It is mentioned that John , Medley and Lioba help lead an uprising of the rogue avatars which resulted in Planet B declaring all rogues to be outlaws . Lioba has changed her appearance and voice and is currently on the run from the Planet B corporation . The whereabouts of John are unknown , and it is implied that Medley has been killed by Cerberus , who has since lost his job and is now killing both rogue and human controlled avatars as he sees fit . 
 A new character called Kip Berenger ( Joseph Cohen @-@ Cole ) is introduced , a computer games expert who followed the uprising and is a fan of Lioba . While on a dating website in Planet B , he comes into contact with Lioba and offers his help . She is at first reluctant , but when they are both attacked by Cerberus they flee together . Kip later reveals that like Lioba he is dead in the real world . 
 As they travel from world to world , Lioba and Kip learn that the people behind Planet B appear to be killing people in real life for an unknown reason . There are also more people who have died in real life but still exist in Planet B , known as " Have Nots " , as opposed to those who are still alive , known as " <unk> " . What is more the real world is in chaos for several unexplained reasons . 
 Kip and Lioba enter a site called " The Underworld " which is akin to Greek mythology . While there Lioba turns into a Gorgon and the only way for them to escape is for Kip to turn Lioba into stone . The end of the series see Kip crying at the realisation that he has committed murder and that he is now master of Cerberus .

 In the third series , Mark Schwartz , the head of Planet B , announces that the original Planet B is to shut down and replaced by a new service , Planet B Platinum . He claims it is to provide a new service , but it is really designed to kill all the rogues in the old site . 
 Kip is currently in a site which simulates the Black Forest where he encounters a voice , which turns out to be Medley , who was able to come back from the dead because when rogues die their code becomes part of Planet B. Kip and Medley travel between worlds in an attempt to find a code which allow them access to the " reset button " which will restore Planet B to its original state . However , they are being pursued by Cerberus who has been upgraded and become even more violent . 
 Kip manages to learn the code but is seemingly too late . Planet B shuts down , with the virtual world slowly being destroyed . However , they discover the reset button and attempt to enter the code . As they reach it , Schwartz appears and attempts to stop them , but he in turn is stopped by Cerberus . Cerberus helps Kip and <unk> , having learned that he too is a rogue and had false memories implanted by the corporation to make him believe that he had a life outside Planet B. The code is activated and the button is pressed , resetting the whole of Planet B.

 Planet B is the largest ever original drama commission for BBC Radio 7 , with the first series being ten episodes long . It was broadcast as part of a science fiction season on BBC Radio . Broughton acts as the head writer for the show . Dromgoole , the series producer , describes the character of John as being , " a real character trapped in a sci @-@ fi . So in a sense , he is our guide into it . He 's very skeptical about it and he 's innocent about everything he encounters there . " 
 James Robinson , the script editor for Planet B said that one of the main advantages of a series such as this is that it can be set anywhere saying , " One week it 's westerns , one week it 's full @-@ on sci @-@ fi space operas , and that 's one of the nice things about the best sci @-@ fi concepts . I think , you know , the Doctor Who 's and the Quantum Leap 's , you kind of get a different show each week . " 
 The cast for Planet B comes from the Radio Drama Company , a repertory radio company . This is because they cost nothing to use and the budget for the show is small . The cast of the Radio Drama Company changes around every six months , which means that cast of Planet B changes every series . 
 All episodes have been available download as a podcast . Nearly 25 @,@ 000 people downloaded the first series . 
 The second series was promoted using an online binaural advert . It is also being used to launch a pilot scheme of a " Series catch @-@ up " on the BBC iPlayer , in which the episodes will be on the iPlayer for longer than seven days so that people can catch up with the entire series .

 The series received mostly positive reviews . Phil <unk> from The Guardian selected Planet B as his pick of the day when the show was first broadcast . He wrote that it , " is likely to be one of those love @-@ it @-@ or @-@ hate @-@ it experiences . " On 6 March 2009 Scott Matthewman from The Stage wrote : " I am shame @-@ faced , in that I missed this intense drama serial off last week ’ s preview . Matthew Broughton 's tale of a malfunctioning virtual world is engrossing . " 
 Ian Dunn from One Giant Leap also wrote positively : " The series has been amazingly gripping . The situation of the show allows it to be set just about anywhere , much like Doctor Who . The plot is enticing and you really care about the characters . " He also commented : " One intriguing thing about the series so far is that some of the scenarios have been rather adult for a show broadcast at 6pm . One episode , set in a Roman world featured a scene in a sex dungeon . Another featured Cerberus doing what all dogs do ( no matter how many heads they have ) and urinate on a motorbike – well , half man @-@ half motorbike . "

Dodd sat on many boards of review during the service 's infancy and was one of the members who condemned pusher planes in favor of tractors . He served with General John Pershing on the Mexican Border where he set records for endurance flying . During World War I he was first assigned as the Aviation Officer of the American Expeditionary Force in 1917 . He was later replaced by Colonel Billy Mitchell and was reassigned to the Bolling Mission . 
 He was the first US pilot to receive the Distinguished Service Medal during World War I. Dodd was promoted to colonel on 14 August 1918 and at the end of the war he was appointed the Chief of Staff , Material under Mitchell . Dodd was then posted to Fort Sam Houston at San Antonio . With the completion of the war he reverted to his pre @-@ war rank of captain and became the commander of Langley Field , Hampton , Virginia . After returning home from the war he competed in endurance flight competitions and during one such contest he crashed and died . Nine years after his death Dodd Army Airfield was named in his honor .

 On 25 September 1909 , Dodd was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps . He was transferred to the Aviation Section , Signal Corps in 1912 . While there he became a fully qualified military aviator . In the War Department General Order # 39 , dated 27 May 1913 , Dodd was listed as one of the " original military aviators " . On 13 February 1913 , he established a non @-@ stop duration of flight record , by flying 244 @.@ 18 miles in 4 hours , 43 minutes in aircraft SC 26 ( a Burgess Model H ) . Promoted to the rank of first lieutenant , Dodd was ordered to join the 1st Aero Squadron at Texas City , Texas , on 9 March 1913 . In June Dodd , along with his squadron , transferred to the San Diego Signal Corps Aviation School ( now known as Rockwell Field ) . There he participated in various flight experiments and sat on boards to establish training requirements and aircraft specifications . Dodd qualified as a military aviator on 30 December 1913 . 
 The Aeronautical Department experienced a spate of fatal accidents between 1912 and 1913 , most involving the Wright Model C airplane . A board of aviators , including Dodd , was convened to investigate safety concerns and make recommendations . Dodd , along with Captain Benjamin Foulois and Lieutenants Walter R. Taliaferro , Carleton G. Chapman , and Joseph E. Carberry , condemned not just the Wright C but all " pusher " aircraft as unsafe on 16 February 1914 , and those remaining in the Army inventory were ordered to be immediately grounded . The following month , the board drew up specifications for a tractor @-@ configured training airplane . Dodd was involved in the aftermath of a major incident in 1914 , which became known as the Goodier Court Martial . The commanding officer of the 1st Aero Squadron 's 2nd Company at San Diego , Capt. Lewis E. Goodier , was seriously injured in a demonstration accident on 5 November 1914 . Goodier was flying with Glenn L. Martin in a new aircraft when they stalled during a required competitive slow speed test and , when Martin over corrected with too much throttle , went into what was described as the first tailspin . Goodier suffered a nearly severed nose , two broken legs , a re @-@ opened skull fracture , and a severe puncture of his knee from the drive shaft . After a cursory review of the crashes , school commandant Capt. Arthur S. Cowan , dismissed the pilots as " nothing but amateurs " . While recuperating , Goodier assisted Dodd and 1st Lt. Walter Taliaferro in an attempt to prefer charges against Cowan for fraudulently collecting flight pay when he was neither certified to fly nor on flying duty . These charges were dismissed as being laid out of malice . 
 Dodd went with the 1st Aero to Galveston during the Vera Cruz incident in 1914 , then to Fort Sill . Following a promotion to captain , Dodd and his observer , Lieutenant S. W. Fitzgerald , won the third annual contest for the Mackay aviation trophy when he descended at North Island after a trip of three hours and three minutes . The contest for the Mackay trophy involved serial reconnaissance of troops maneuvering in the vicinity of San Diego and reports of their numbers and disposition . Accidents eliminated all machines but theirs and the trophy would not have been awarded that year if Fitzgerald had not provided a comprehensive and accurate report of the composition and location of the troops . 
 On 12 March 1916 , Dodd was appointed as a pilot to the 1st Aero Squadron , under General John Pershing 's 8th Brigade , which was positioned on the Mexican border . As the pilot of Airplane # 44 , he and his observer , Captain Foulois , made the first reconnaissance flight into Mexico on 15 March 1916 . Throughout the rest of March and early April they would fly deep into Mexico to observe troop movements and fly dispatches to other bases . Upon the completion of his work in Mexico he remained with the 1st Aero Squadron and was promoted to major in May 1917 .

 While serving under Pershing , Dodd gained experience and was appointed to a staff position as the Aviation Officer within the American Expeditionary Force ( AEF ) , when it was raised for overseas service during World War I. Before sailing to France , on 27 May 1917 , Dodd sent his assistant , Lt. Birdseye B. Lewis , to New York with instructions to round @-@ up qualified candidates for the aviation staff . Among the applicants was auto race car driver , Edward V. Rickenbacker , who was promptly enlisted as a sergeant first class , chauffeur . Upon his arrival in Europe in late 1917 , Dodd was appointed lieutenant colonel in the Signal Corps . 
 As an Aviation Officer it was Dodd 's job to liaise with , and understand , the Allies ' needs , requirements , and recommendations . To do so he spent several days in London where he spoke to the US Military Attaché , Colonel William Lassiter , and various British officials . Dodd submitted his report to the AEF on 20 June 1917 with a recommendation on what needed to be done . Dodd first used the term " Air Service " in a memo to the chief of staff of the AEF on 20 June 1917 . The term also appeared on 5 July 1917 , in AEF General Order No. 8 , in tables detailing staff organization and duties . The Air Service , American Expeditionary Forces was formally created on 3 September 1917 when General Order 31 was published , and remained in being until demobilized in 1919 . Dodd , however , had been superseded as Aviation Officer by Colonel William Mitchell , who outranked him . Mitchell replaced Dodd on 30 June 1917 , with the position renamed " Chief of Air Service " and its duties changed and rewritten . 
 The Bolling Commission ( also known as the Bolling Mission and named after Colonel Raynal Bolling , the head of the mission ) was an aeronautical commission sent to Europe on behalf of the Aircraft Production Board of the Council of National Defense . Dodd was assigned to the mission , after being replaced as Aviation Officer . His assignment was to evaluate aircraft for use by the AEF , specifically for reconnaissance purposes . Dodd evaluated French aircraft and favored adopting the Salmson two @-@ seater for reconnaissance work . Eventually 705 <unk> were purchased for the Air Service ; of these 557 saw front @-@ line service . 
 Along with several other graduates of the Aviation Section 's winter 1916 " Field Officers Course " , Dodd was given a temporary wartime promotion to colonel and under the command of General William L. Kenly , Dodd was named Director of Air Service Instruction ( DAI ) . An artillery officer , Kenly had been the Executive Officer of the Aviation School in San Diego before the outbreak of war and instructed Dodd , Bolling and Mitchell . Bolling and Mitchell were also promoted , with Bolling being appointed to the role of Director of Air Service Supply ( <unk> ) to administer the " Zone of the Line of Communications " ( sic ) , later called the Service of Supply . Kenly proved to be only an interim commander , though , and on 27 November 1917 he was replaced by Brig. Gen. Benjamin Foulois who arrived in France with a large but untrained staff of non @-@ aviators . This resulted in considerable resentment from Mitchell 's smaller , established , staff , many of whom , including Bolling and Dodd , were immediately displaced . Dodd , Bolling , and Mitchell resented their being replaced by non @-@ aviators and after leaving the theater of operations all continued to further the Air Service in their own ways .

 During Dodd 's service in World War I he was the first US pilot to receive the Distinguished Service Medal . His citation reads : 
 The President of the United States of America , authorized by Act of Congress , July 9 , 1918 , takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Colonel ( Air Service ) Townsend F. Dodd , United States Army Air Service , for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States , in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. Colonel Dodd organized the Aviation Training School at Issoudun and successfully conducted the negotiations for the first purchase of aeroplanes from allied governments for the use of the American Expeditionary Forces . He later served with distinction as Chief of the Supply Section , Air Service , American Expeditionary Forces , and as Technical Advisor and Information Officer of the Chief of the Air Service , 1st Army .

 While Dodd was the commander of Langley Field he was killed in an air crash . The crash occurred on 5 October 1919 at Bustleton Field , Philadelphia , during the New York to Los Angeles transcontinental air race . On 1 May 1928 Remount Station # 1 was named Dodd Army Airfield , the nation 's first dedicated military airfield . Dodd Army Airfield was an airfield located within the current boundaries of Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio , Texas . Dodd Field includes the area bounded on the north by <unk> Road , on the west by Harry <unk> Memorial Highway , on the south by Winans ( formerly Dashiell ) Road and on the east by the Fort Sam Houston Reservation boundary . Dodd Field was designated in War Department General Order Number 5 . Prior to deployment to Europe for World War I Dodd had served at the remount station and had been Commander of the Aviation Post when the 3rd Aero Squadron was stationed there . He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery with a simple gravestone located at Plot : Section 3 , Site Lot <unk> . Active flight operations were terminated in October 1931 , although the official date of closure of Dodd Field as an aviation facility has not been determined .

 Obama was born on August 4 , 1961 , at <unk> Maternity & <unk> Hospital ( now <unk> Medical Center for Women and Children ) in Honolulu , Hawaii ; he is the first President to have been born in Hawaii . His mother , Stanley Ann Dunham , born in Wichita , Kansas , was of mostly English ancestry . His father , Barack Obama Sr. , was a Luo from Nyang <unk> Kogelo , Kenya . Obama 's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa , where his father was a foreign student on scholarship . The couple married in Wailuku on Maui on February 2 , 1961 , and separated when , in late August 1961 , Obama 's mother moved with their newborn son to attend the University of Washington in Seattle for a year . During that time , Obama Sr. completed his undergraduate economics degree in Hawaii in June 1962 , then left to attend graduate school at Harvard University on a scholarship . Obama 's parents divorced in March 1964 . Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964 where he remarried ; he visited Barack in Hawaii only once , in 1971 . He died in an automobile accident in 1982 , his son being 21 years old at that time . 
 In 1963 , Dunham met Lolo Soetoro , an Indonesian East – West Center graduate student in geography at the University of Hawaii , and the couple were married on Molokai on March 15 , 1965 . After two one @-@ year extensions of his J @-@ 1 visa , Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966 , followed sixteen months later by his wife and stepson in 1967 , with the family initially living in a Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the <unk> subdistrict of south Jakarta , then from 1970 in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng subdistrict of central Jakarta . From ages six to ten , Obama attended local Indonesian @-@ language schools : Santo <unk> <unk> ( St. Francis of Assisi ) Catholic School for two years and Besuki Public School for one and a half years , supplemented by English @-@ language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother . 
 Obama returned to Honolulu in 1971 to live with his maternal grandparents , Madelyn and Stanley Dunham , and with the aid of a scholarship attended Punahou School , a private college preparatory school , from fifth grade until his graduation from high school in 1979 . In his youth , Obama went by the nickname Barry . Obama lived with his mother and sister in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii . Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work . His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia , divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992 , before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following treatment for ovarian cancer and uterine cancer . 
 Of his early childhood , Obama recalled , " That my father looked nothing like the people around me – that he was black as pitch , my mother white as milk – barely registered in my mind . " He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage . Reflecting later on his years in Honolulu , Obama wrote : " The opportunity that Hawaii offered – to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect – became an integral part of my world view , and a basis for the values that I hold most dear . " Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol , marijuana , and cocaine during his teenage years to " push questions of who I was out of my mind " . Obama was also a member of the " <unk> gang " , a self @-@ named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana . 
 After high school , Obama moved to Los Angeles in 1979 to attend Occidental College . In February 1981 , Obama made his first public speech , calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation 's policy of apartheid .
