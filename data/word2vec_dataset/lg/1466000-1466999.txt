 On January 12 , 2015 , during early evening rush , a Yellow Line train stopped in the tunnel and filled with smoke just after departing L 'Enfant Plaza for Pentagon due to " an electrical arcing event " ahead in the tunnel . Everyone on board was evacuated ; 84 people were taken to hospitals and one person died . 
 On March 14 , 2016 , an electrified rail caught fire between McPherson Square and Farragut West , causing significant disruptions on the Blue , Orange , and Silver lines . On March 15 , a decision was made to close the entire rail network the following day to inspect the network 's entire electric rail power grid .

 WMATA expects an average of one million riders daily by 2030 . The need to increase capacity has renewed plans to add 220 cars to the system and reroute trains to alleviate congestion at the busiest stations . Population growth in the region has also revived efforts to extend service , build new stations , and construct additional lines . 
 = = = Silver Line = = = 
 The most prominent expansion is the Dulles Corridor Metrorail Project , dubbed the Silver Line , a 23 @-@ mile ( 37 km ) extension from the Orange Line into Loudoun County , Virginia , by way of Tysons Corner and Washington Dulles International Airport . Rail to Dulles has been discussed since the system opened in 1976 . The current Silver Line project was formally proposed in 2002 and initially approved by the Federal Transit Administration in 2004 . After several delays , federal funding for Phase 1 was secured in December 2008 and construction began in March 2009 . The line will be constructed in two phases ; the first phase to Wiehle – Reston East in Reston , Virginia opened July 26 , 2014 , and the second phase to Virginia Route 772 , beyond Dulles Airport , is projected for completion in 2019 or 2020 . 
 = = = Blue Line realignment = = = 
 Blue Line trains share a single tunnel with Orange Line and Silver Line trains to cross the Potomac River . The current tunnel limits service in each direction , creating a choke point . A 2001 proposal would have rerouted the Blue Line between the Rosslyn and Stadium – Armory stations by building a bridge or tunnel from Virginia to a new station in Georgetown . The proposal was later rejected due to cost , but Metro again started considering a similar scenario in 2011 .

 The Virginia Department of Transportation ( VDOT ) announced on Jan 18 , 2008 that it and the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation ( <unk> ) had begun work on a draft environmental impact statement ( EIS ) for the I @-@ 66 corridor in Fairfax and Prince William counties . According to VDOT the EIS , officially named the I @-@ 66 <unk> Transportation and Environment Study , would focus on improving mobility along I @-@ 66 from the Capital Beltway ( I @-@ 495 ) interchange in Fairfax County to the interchange with U.S. Route 15 in Prince William County . The EIS also allegedly includes a four station extension of the Orange Line past Vienna . The extension would continue to run in the I @-@ 66 median and would have stations at Chain Bridge Road , Fair Oaks , Stringfellow Road and Centreville near Virginia Route 28 and U.S. Route 29 . In its final report published June 8 , 2012 , the study and analysis revealed that an " extension would have a minimal impact on Metrorail ridership and volumes on study area roadways inside the Beltway and would therefore not relieve congestion in the study corridor . "

 In 2005 , the Defense Department announced that it would be shifting 18 @,@ 000 jobs to Fort Belvoir in Virginia and at least 5 @,@ 000 jobs to Fort Meade in Maryland by 2012 , as part of that year 's Base Realignment and Closure plan . In anticipation of such a move , local officials and the military proposed extending the Blue and Green Lines to service each base . The proposed extension of the Green Line could cost $ 100 million per mile ( $ 60 million per kilometer ) , and a light rail extension to Fort Belvoir was estimated to cost up to $ 800 million . Neither proposal has established timelines for planning or construction .

 In 2008 , officials began to explore the possibility of adding an infill station called Potomac Yard in the Potomac Yard area of Alexandria , on the Blue and Yellow Lines between the National Airport and Braddock Road stations . In 2010 , the Alexandria City Council approved a portion of the proposed $ 240 million construction of the station . If the council approves the final budget , construction would start in 2017 and the station would be scheduled to open in late 2018 or early 2019 .

 In 2011 , Metro began studying the needs of the system through 2040 . New Metro rail lines and extensions under consideration as part of this long term plan include : a new line which parallels the Capital Beltway ; a new line from the Friendship Heights Metro station to White Oak , Maryland , which would pass through the District and Silver Spring ; an extension of the Green Line to National Harbor in Maryland ; and re @-@ routing the Blue Line in the District between the Orange Line and Green Line . None of these lines are yet funded for planning or construction .

 A number of light rail and urban streetcar projects have been proposed to extend or supplement service provided by Metro . Like the Silver Line in Virginia , the proposed Purple Line has been in planning since the 1980s . The project was originally envisioned as a circular heavy rail line connecting the outer stations on each branch of the Metrorail system , in a pattern roughly mirroring the Capital Beltway . The current proposal would create a light rail system in Maryland between the Bethesda and New Carrollton stations by way of Silver Spring and College Park . Such a plan would connect both branches of the Red Line to the Green and Orange Lines , and would decrease the travel time between suburban Metro stations . 
 The Corridor Cities Transitway ( CCT ) is a proposed 15 miles ( 24 km ) bus rapid transit line that would link Clarksburg , Maryland in northern Montgomery County with the Shady Grove station on the Red Line . Assuming that the anticipated federal , state , and local government funds are provided , construction of the first 9 miles ( 14 km ) of the system would begin in 2018 . 
 In 2005 , a Maryland lawmaker proposed a light rail system to connect areas of Southern Maryland , especially the rapidly growing area around the town of Waldorf , to the Branch Avenue station on the Green Line . The project is still in the planning stages . 
 The District of Columbia Department of Transportation is building the new DC Streetcar system to improve transit connectivity within the District . A tram line to connect Bolling Air Force Base to the Anacostia station and was originally expected to open in 2010 . Streetcar routes have been proposed in the Atlas District , Capitol Hill , and the K Street corridor . After seven years of construction , the Atlas District route , known as the H / Benning Street route , opened on February 27 , 2016 .

 = My Worlds Acoustic = 
 My Worlds Acoustic is the first remix album by Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber . It was released on November 26 , 2010 and was initially sold exclusively at Walmart retail stores and Sam 's Club . The album features nine acoustic versions of songs from his debut extended play , My World , and first album My World 2 @.@ 0 , as well as a new song " Pray . " The new versions of the songs were produced by Bieber 's music director , Dan Kanter , his vocal producer Kuk Harrell , and also producer Rob Wells . Internationally , the set is included as a part of the compilation album , My Worlds : The Collection , which included songs from the previous two releases . My Worlds Acoustic was released to iTunes , on February 8 , 2011 . 
 According to Bieber , he wanted to release the album for the naysayers who critiqued his actual singing ability . The singer said that he wanted to have an acoustic album , to reflect the effect of production on his vocals . Although labeled as an acoustic album , the songs still include subtle usages of electronic sounds such as synthesizers . The album received generally favorable reviews from critics , however most critics were not satisfied that the album was not genuinely acoustic . In Canada , the song debuted at number five , and later peaked at number four on the Canadian Albums Chart and certified Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association . My Worlds Acoustic debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200 , selling 115 @,@ 000 copies in its first week , becoming Bieber 's third consecutive top ten album . 
 = = Background and marketing = = 
 On October 18 , 2010 , Bieber announced on his Twitter plans for an acoustic album in time for the holiday season , and that it would feature unplugged versions of his songs , as well as a new song . Days later , on October 24 , 2010 , he revealed that the album was set for release on November 26 , 2010 . In an interview with MTV News , Bieber said that the album was for the " haters " who say he cannot sing and saying his voice was auto @-@ tuned , and that " stripping it down and having it kind of really mellow and being able to hear my voice " was his purpose . The singer said he wanted to do the acoustic set because the Electronic Music production sometimes " drowns out your voice " and " takes away from the singer , over the synths and everything . " According to Kyle Anderson of MTV News the album might not have been " just another project " , but rather the purpose could be " to prove the he has the skills to sustain a long and fulfilling career . " In the same interview he confirmed that " Baby " and other My World 2 @.@ 0 songs were re @-@ recorded , as well as a new song . 
 It was later confirmed that the song was an inspirational song entitled , " Pray . " According to Bieber , the song is a gift to his fans . The song 's arrangement is set to reflect Bieber 's music before he was discovered , but also includes instrumentation from a string quartet , congas , and a cajón drum , the latter to represent Bieber 's worldy travels , specifically to Africa . While Bieber was being interviewed by Ryan Seacrest on his radio show , Bieber talked about the song 's initial writing stating that it was influenced by Michael Jackson , and he thought of Jackson 's " Man in the Mirror " when writing the song . Vocally , Bieber 's vocals are sung in a lower key compared to previous singles . Bieber plays guitar on the album , along with his guitarist and musical director Dan Kanter . The new versions of the other songs on the album were produced by Kanter , Bieber 's vocal producer Kuk Harrell , and also producer Rob Wells . 
 To promote the album as well as draw interest for Bieber 's then @-@ upcoming 3D film , Justin Bieber : Never Say Never , Bieber shot an alternate music video for the acoustic version of the song , " Never Say Never . " The video premiered during Game 3 of the 2010 World Series , and in the clip , the singer dons apparel from both teams . Bieber performed " Pray " for the first time at the 2010 American Music Awards . The performance opened with Bieber sitting playing the piano while singing . Midway through the performance Bieber arose from the piano and took center stage ; he was accompanied by a choir singing background vocals . The performance was ended with Bieber kneeling singing the song 's title , the performance was greeted by standing ovation from the audience . After originally being sold only at Walmart and Sam 's Club first , the album was released on iTunes on February 11 , 2011 , accompanying the release of Justin Bieber : Never Say Never , and preceding the release of Never Say Never – The Remixes .

 Lucy Jones of The Daily Telegraph said that " with catchy choruses , soulful key changes and cute hooks laid bare , these are undeniably brilliant pop songs . " Jones further commented that " finger clicks , bongos and mellow guitars are a welcome change from the squealing synths and pounding beats favoured by Bieber and his peers , " and that the album had the ability to connect with audiences beyond his demographic . Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a " B- " rating , stating that the album doesn 't change Bieber 's beloved " kiddie @-@ soul vocals " calling it " perfunctory " , but said that acoustic renditions such as " Baby " , " One Time " and new song " Pray " deliver their " saccharine payload . " Thomas <unk> of Chicago Sun @-@ Times said that " calming down several of the pop tunes with slower tempos and patient singing " was not bad and that slowing everything down made listeners hear how the singer 's voice had matured . 
 Calling it " the <unk> acoustic album in history , " Allison Stewart of The Washington Post said " its arrangements and melodies – the best parts of any Bieber record - are stripped down but otherwise little changed , demonstrating just how great most of these songs were to begin with . " Stewart also said that urban numbers such as " Baby , " " survive their makeovers without a hitch . " Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave the album 2 and a half out of 5 stars saying that the album was " an enticement . " Dan Savoie of Rockstar Weekly gave the album 4 out of 5 stars , saying that it is " the perfect showcase for a talented young artist who 's on his way to the Grammy Awards this year . " Although she commented that the " acoustic " labeling was a bit misleading , Monica Hererra of Billboard said that the album " succeeds " , calling songs like the live version of " Favorite Girl " the album 's saving grace and " truly acoustic . " On the former , Herrera said , " It 's the one moment where you can hear all of the young artist 's strengths falling in line @-@ raw talent , maturing vocals and , of course , an all @-@ too @-@ valuable connection with his fans .

 = French ironclad Marengo = 
 Marengo was a wooden @-@ hulled , armored frigate of the Océan class , built for the French Navy in the mid to late 1860s . The ship was running her sea trials in July 1870 when the Franco @-@ Prussian War began and was immediately placed in reserve until after the war was over . Marengo participated in the French occupation of Tunisia in 1881 and was flagship of the Northern Squadron in 1891 when it made port visits in Britain and Russia . She was sold for scrap in 1896 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Océan @-@ class ironclads were designed by Henri Dupuy de Lôme as an improved version of the Provence @-@ class ironclads . The ships were central battery ironclads with the armament concentrated amidships . For the first time in a French ironclad three watertight iron bulkheads were fitted in the hull . Like most ironclads of their era they were equipped with a metal @-@ reinforced ram . 
 The ship measured 87 @.@ 73 meters ( 287 ft 10 in ) overall , with a beam of 17 @.@ 52 meters ( 57 ft 6 in ) . Marengo had a maximum draft of 9 @.@ 09 meters ( 29 ft 10 in ) and displaced 7 @,@ 749 metric tons ( 7 @,@ 627 long tons ) . Her crew numbered between 750 and 778 officers and men . The metacentric height of the ship was very low , between 1 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 5 – 0 @.@ 7 m ) . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Océan @-@ class ships had one horizontal return connecting rod compound steam engine driving a single propeller . Their engines were powered by eight oval boilers . On sea trials the engine produced 3 @,@ 600 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 700 kW ) and <unk> reached 13 @.@ 5 knots ( 25 @.@ 0 km / h ; 15 @.@ 5 mph ) . She carried 650 metric tons ( 640 long tons ) of coal which allowed her to steam for approximately 3 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 600 km ; 3 @,@ 500 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The Océan @-@ class ships were barque or barquentine @-@ rigged with three masts and had a sail area around 2 @,@ 000 square meters ( 22 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 These ships had their main armament mounted in four barbettes on the upper deck , one gun at each corner of the battery , with the remaining guns on the battery deck below the barbettes . Marengo 's armament was upgraded , before she commissioned , to four 274 @-@ millimeter ( 10 @.@ 8 in ) guns in the barbettes , and on the battery deck , four 240 @-@ millimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) and seven 138 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 4 in ) guns . By 1885 two more 274 @-@ millimeter guns had been added and all of the 138 @-@ millimeter guns were replaced by four 120 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns . 
 The 18 @-@ caliber 274 @-@ millimeter Modéle 1870 gun fired an armor @-@ piercing , 476 @.@ 2 @-@ pound ( 216 @.@ 0 kg ) shell while the gun itself weighed 22 @.@ 84 long tons ( 23 @.@ 21 t ) . The gun fired its shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 424 ft / s ( 434 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 14 @.@ 3 inches ( 360 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The armor @-@ piercing shell of the 19 @-@ caliber 240 @-@ millmeter Modele 1870 gun weighed 317 @.@ 5 pounds ( 144 @.@ 0 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 15 @.@ 41 long tons ( 15 @.@ 66 t ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 624 ft / s ( 495 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 14 @.@ 4 inches ( 366 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The 138 @-@ millimeter gun was 21 calibers long and weighed 2 @.@ 63 long tons ( 2 @.@ 67 t ) . It fired a 61 @.@ 7 @-@ pound ( 28 @.@ 0 kg ) explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 529 ft / s ( 466 m / s ) . The guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells . 
 At some point the ship received a dozen 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss 5 @-@ barrel revolving guns . They fired a shell weighing about 500 g ( 1 @.@ 1 lb ) at a muzzle velocity of about 610 m / s ( 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ) to a range of about 3 @,@ 200 meters ( 3 @,@ 500 yd ) . They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute . The hull was not recessed to enable any of the guns on the battery deck to fire forward or aft . However , the guns mounted in the barbettes sponsoned out over the sides of the hull did have some ability to fire fore and aft . Late in the ship 's career four above @-@ water 356 @-@ millimeter ( 14 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes were added .

 The Ocean @-@ class ships had a complete 178 – 203 @-@ millimeter ( 7 @.@ 0 – 8 @.@ 0 in ) wrought iron waterline belt . The sides of the battery itself were armored with 160 millimeters ( 6 @.@ 3 in ) of wrought iron . The barbette armor was 150 millimeters ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick . The unarmored portions of their sides were protected by 15 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) iron plates . Gardiner says that the barbette armor was later removed to improve their stability , but this is not confirmed by any other source .

 Marengo was laid down at Brest in July 1865 and launched on 15 October 1868 . The ship began her sea trials on 1 July 1870 and was running them when the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1870 – 71 began . She was immediately put in reserve and not commissioned until 1872 for service with the Mediterranean Squadron . Marengo remained with the squadron until 1876 when she was again placed in reserve . On 2 October 1880 the ship was recommissioned and assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron . Marengo was transferred to the Levant Squadron ( French : Division Navale du Levant ) on 13 February 1881 and bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax in July as part of the French occupation of Tunisia . She remained in the Mediterranean until 1886 when she was assigned to the Reserve Squadron . In 1888 Marengo became the flagship of the Northern Squadron and led the squadron during its port visits to Osborne Bay and Spithead in August 1891 and to Kronstadt in September 1891 . She was reduced to reserve the following year and sold on 7 March 1896 . 
 = Central London Railway = 
 The Central London Railway ( CLR ) , also known as the Twopenny Tube , was a deep @-@ level , underground " tube " railway that opened in London in 1900 . The CLR 's tunnels and stations form the central section of the London Underground 's Central line . 
 The railway company was established in 1889 , funding for construction was obtained in 1895 through a syndicate of financiers and work took place from 1896 to 1900 . When opened , the CLR served 13 stations and ran completely underground in a pair of tunnels for 9 @.@ 14 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 68 mi ) between its western terminus at Shepherd 's Bush and its eastern terminus at the Bank of England , with a depot and power station to the north of the western terminus . After a rejected proposal to turn the line into a loop , it was extended at the western end to Wood Lane in 1908 and at the eastern end to Liverpool Street station in 1912 . In 1920 , it was extended along a Great Western Railway line to Ealing to serve a total distance of 17 @.@ 57 kilometres ( 10 @.@ 92 mi ) . 
 After initially making good returns for investors , the CLR suffered a decline in passenger numbers due to increased competition from other underground railway lines and new motorised buses . In 1913 , it was taken over by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London ( UERL ) , operator of the majority of London 's underground railways . In 1933 the CLR was taken into public ownership along with the UERL . 
 = = Establishment = = 
 = = = Origin , 1889 – 92 = = = 
 In November 1889 , the CLR published a notice of a private bill that would be presented to Parliament for the 1890 parliamentary session . The bill proposed an underground electric railway running from the junction of Queen 's Road ( now Queensway ) and Bayswater Road in Bayswater to King William Street in the City of London with a connection to the then @-@ under construction , City and South London Railway ( C & SLR ) at Arthur Street West . The CLR was to run in a pair of tunnels under Bayswater Road , Oxford Street , New Oxford Street , High Holborn , Holborn , Holborn Viaduct , Newgate Street , Cheapside , and Poultry . Stations were planned at Queen 's Road , Stanhope Terrace , Marble Arch , Oxford Circus , Tottenham Court Road , Southampton Row , Holborn Circus , St. Martin 's Le Grand and King William Street . 
 The tunnels were to be 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 35 m ) in diameter , constructed with a tunnelling shield , and would be lined with cast iron segments . At stations , the tunnel diameter would be 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 71 m ) or 29 feet ( 8 @.@ 84 m ) depending on layout . A depot and power station were to be constructed on a 1 @.@ 5 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 61 ha ) site on the west side of Queen 's Road . Hydraulic lifts from the street to the platforms were to be provided at each station . 
 The proposals faced strong objections from the Metropolitan and District Railways ( MR and DR ) whose routes on the Inner Circle , to the north and the south respectively , the CLR route paralleled ; and from which the new line was expected to take passengers . The City Corporation also objected , concerned about potential damage to buildings close to the route caused by subsidence as was experienced during the construction of the C & SLR . The Dean and Chapter of St Paul 's Cathedral objected , concerned about the risks of undermining the cathedral 's foundations . Sir Joseph Bazalgette objected that the tunnels would damage the city 's sewer system . The bill was approved by the House of Commons , but was rejected by the House of Lords , which recommended that any decision be postponed until after the C & SLR had opened and its operation could be assessed . 
 In November 1890 , with the C & SLR about to start operating , the CLR announced a new bill for the 1891 parliamentary session . The route was extended at the western end to run under Notting Hill High Street ( now Notting Hill Gate ) and Holland Park Avenue to end at the eastern corner of Shepherd 's Bush Green , with the depot and power station site relocated to be north of the terminus on the east side of Wood Lane . The westward extension of the route was inspired by the route of abandoned plans for the London Central Subway , a sub @-@ surface railway that was briefly proposed in early 1890 to run directly below the roadway on a similar route to the CLR . The eastern terminus was changed to Cornhill and the proposed Southampton Row station was replaced by one in Bloomsbury . Intermediate stations were added at Lansdowne Road , Notting Hill Gate , Davies Street ( which the CLR planned to extend northwards to meet Oxford Street ) and at Chancery Lane . The earlier plan to connect to the C & SLR was dropped and the diameter of the CLR 's tunnels was increased to 11 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 51 m ) . This time the bill was approved by both Houses of Parliament and received Royal Assent on 5 August 1891 as the Central London Railway Act , 1891 . In November 1891 , the CLR publicised another bill . The eastern end of the line was re @-@ routed north @-@ east and extended to end under the Great Eastern Railway 's ( GER 's ) terminus at Liverpool Street station with the Cornhill terminus dropped and a new station proposed at the Royal Exchange . The proposals received assent as the Central London Railway Act , 1892 on 28 June 1892 . 
 The money to build the CLR was obtained through a syndicate of financiers including Ernest Cassel , Henry Oppenheim , Darius Ogden Mills , and members of the Rothschild family . On 22 March 1894 , the syndicate incorporated a contractor to construct the railway , the Electric Traction Company Limited ( ETCL ) , which agreed a construction cost of £ 2 @,@ 544 @,@ 000 ( approximately £ 261 million today ) plus £ 700 @,@ 000 in 4 per cent debenture stock . When the syndicate offered 285 @,@ 000 CLR company shares for sale at £ 10 each in June 1895 , only 14 per cent was bought by the British public , which was cautious of such investments following failures of similar railway schemes . Some shares were sold in Europe and the United States , but the unsold remainder was bought by members of the syndicate or by the ETCL . 
 = = = Construction , 1896 – 1900 = = = 
 To design the railway , the CLR employed the engineers James Henry Greathead , Sir John Fowler , and Sir Benjamin Baker . Greathead had been the engineer for the Tower Subway and the C & SLR , and had developed the tunnelling shield used to excavate those companies ' tunnels under the River Thames . Fowler had been the engineer on the Metropolitan Railway , the world 's first underground railway opened in 1863 , and Baker had worked on New York 's elevated railways and on the Forth Railway Bridge with Fowler . Greathead died shortly after work began and was replaced by Basil Mott , his assistant during the construction of the C & SLR . 
 Like most legislation of its kind , the act of 1891 imposed a time limit for the compulsory purchase of land and the raising of capital . The original date specified for completion of construction was the end of 1896 , but the time required to raise the finance and purchase station sites meant that construction had not begun by the start of that year . To give itself extra time , the CLR had obtained an extension of time to 1899 by the Central London Railway Act , 1894 . Construction works were let by the ETCL as three sub @-@ contracts : Shepherd 's Bush to Marble Arch , Marble Arch to St Martin 's Le Grand and St Martin 's Le Grand to Bank . Work began with demolition of buildings at the Chancery Lane site in April 1896 and construction shafts were started at Chancery Lane , Shepherd 's Bush , Stanhope Terrace and Bloomsbury in August and September 1896 . 
 Negotiations with the GER for the works under Liverpool Street station were unsuccessful , and the final section beyond Bank was only constructed for a short distance as sidings . To minimise the risk of subsidence , the routing of the tunnels followed the roads on the surface and avoided passing under buildings . Usually the tunnels were bored side by side 60 – 110 feet ( 18 – 34 m ) below the surface , but where a road was too narrow to allow this , the tunnels were aligned one above the other , so that a number of stations have platforms at different levels . To assist with the deceleration of trains arriving at stations and the acceleration of trains leaving , station tunnels were located at the tops of slight inclines . 
 Tunnelling was completed by the end of 1898 , and , because a planned concrete lining to the cast iron tunnel rings was not installed , the internal diameter of the tunnels was generally 11 feet 8 @.@ 25 inches ( 3 @.@ 56 m ) . For Bank station , the CLR negotiated permission with the City Corporation to construct its ticket hall beneath a steel framework under the roadway and pavements at the junction of Threadneedle Street and Cornhill . This involved diverting pipework and cables into ducts beneath the subways linking the ticket hall to the street . Delays on this work were so costly that they nearly bankrupted the company . A further extension of time to 1900 was obtained through the Central London Railway Act , 1899 . 
 Apart from Bank , which was completely below ground , all stations had buildings designed by Harry Bell Measures . They were single @-@ storey structures to allow for future commercial development above and had elevations faced in beige terracotta . Each station had lifts manufactured by the Sprague Electric Company in New York . The lifts were provided in a variety of sizes and configurations to suit the passenger flow at each station . Generally they operated in sets of two or three in a shared shaft . Station tunnel walls were finished in plain white ceramic tiles and lit by electric arc lamps . The electricity to run the trains and the stations was supplied from the power station at Wood Lane at <unk> AC which was converted at sub @-@ stations along the route to <unk> DC to power the trains via a third rail system . 
 = = Opening = = 
 The official opening of the CLR by the Prince of Wales took place on 27 June 1900 , one day before the time limit of the 1899 Act , although the line did not open to the public until 30 July 1900 . The railway had stations at : 
 Shepherd 's Bush 
 Holland Park 
 Notting Hill Gate 
 Queen 's Road ( now Queensway ) 
 Lancaster Gate 
 Marble Arch 
 Bond Street ( opened 24 September 1900 ) 
 Oxford Circus 
 Tottenham Court Road 
 British Museum ( closed 1933 ) 
 Chancery Lane 
 Post Office ( now St. Paul 's ) 
 Bank 
 The CLR charged a flat fare of two pence for a journey between any two stations , leading the Daily Mail to give the railway the nickname of the Twopenny Tube in August 1900 . The service was very popular , and , by the end of 1900 , the railway had carried 14 @,@ 916 @,@ 922 passengers . By attracting passengers from the bus services along its route and from the slower , steam @-@ hauled , MR and DR services , the CLR achieved passenger numbers around 45 million per year in the first few years of operation , generating a high turnover that was more than twice the expenses . From 1900 to 1905 , the company paid a dividend of 4 per cent to investors . 
 = = Rolling stock = = 
 Greathead had originally planned for the trains to be hauled by a pair of small electric locomotives , one at each end of a train , but the Board of Trade rejected this proposal and a larger locomotive was designed which was able to pull up to seven carriages on its own . Twenty @-@ eight locomotives were manufactured in America by the General Electric Company ( of which syndicate member Darius Ogden Mills was a director ) and assembled in the Wood Lane depot . A fleet of 168 carriages was manufactured by the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company and the Brush Electrical Engineering Company . Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates at each end of the carriages ; these gates were operated by guards who rode on an outside platform . The CLR had originally intended to have two classes of travel , but dropped the plan before opening , although its carriages were built with different qualities of interior fittings for this purpose . 
 Soon after the railway opened , complaints about vibrations from passing trains began to be made by occupiers of buildings along the route . The vibrations were caused by the heavy , largely unsprung locomotives which weighed 44 tons ( 44 @.@ 7 tonnes ) . The Board of Trade set up a committee to investigate the problem , and the CLR experimented with two solutions . For the first solution , three locomotives were modified to use lighter motors and were provided with improved suspension , so the weight was reduced to 31 tons ( 31 @.@ 5 tonnes ) , more of which was sprung to reduce vibrations ; for the second solution , two six @-@ carriage trains were formed that had the two end carriages converted and provided with driver 's cabs and their own motors so they could run as multiple units without a separate locomotive . The lighter locomotives did reduce the vibrations felt at the surface , but the multiple units removed it almost completely and the CLR chose to adopt that solution . The committee 's report , published in 1902 , also found that the CLR 's choice of 100 lb / yard ( 49 @.@ 60 kg / m ) bridge rail for its tracks rather than a stiffer bullhead rail on cross sleepers contributed to the vibration . 
 Following the report , the CLR purchased 64 driving motor carriages for use with the existing stock ; together , these were formed into six- or seven @-@ carriage trains . The change to multiple unit operation was completed by June 1903 and all but two of the locomotives were scrapped . Those two were retained for shunting use in the depot .

 = = = Reversing loops , 1901 = = = 
 The CLR 's ability to manage its high passenger numbers was constrained by the service interval that it could achieve between trains . This was directly related to the time taken to turn around trains at the termini . At the end of a journey , a locomotive had to be disconnected from the leading end of the train and run around to the rear , where it was reconnected before proceeding in the opposite direction ; an exercise that took a minimum of 2 ½ minutes . Seeking to shorten this interval , the CLR published a bill in November 1900 for the 1901 parliamentary session . The bill requested permission to construct loops at each end of the line so that trains could be turned around without disconnecting the locomotive . The loop at the western end was planned to run anti @-@ clockwise under the three sides of Shepherd 's Bush Green . For the eastern loop the alternatives were a loop under Liverpool Street station or a larger loop running under Threadneedle Street , Old Broad Street , Liverpool Street , Bishopsgate and returning to Threadneedle Street . The estimated cost of the loops was £ 800 @,@ 000 ( approximately £ 78 @.@ 1 million today ) , most of which was for the eastern loop with its costly wayleaves . 
 The CLR bill was one of more than a dozen tube railway bills submitted to Parliament for the 1901 session , To review the bills on an equal basis , Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor , but by the time the committee had produced its report , the parliamentary session was almost over and the promoters of the bills were asked to resubmit them for the following 1902 session . Among the committee 's recommendations were the withdrawal of the CLR 's City loop , and that a quick , tube route from Hammersmith to the City of London would benefit London 's commuters . 
 = = = Loop line , 1902 – 05 = = = 
 Rather than resubmit its 1901 bill , the CLR presented a much more ambitious alternative for the 1902 parliamentary session . The reversing loops were dropped , and the CLR instead proposed to turn the whole railway into a single large loop by constructing a new southern route between the two existing end points , adopting the committee 's recommendation for a Hammersmith to City route . At the western end , new tunnels were to be extended from the dead @-@ end reversing siding west of Shepherd 's Bush station and from the depot access tunnel . The route was to pass under Shepherd 's Bush Green and run under Goldhawk Road as far as Hammersmith Grove where it was to turn south . At the southern end of Hammersmith Grove a station was to be provided on the corner of Brook Green Road ( now Shepherd 's Bush Road ) to provide an interchange with the three stations already located there . 
 From Hammersmith , the CLR 's route was to turn eastwards and run under Hammersmith Road and Kensington High Street with interchange stations at the DR 's Addison Road ( now Kensington Olympia ) and High Street Kensington stations . From Kensington High Street , the route was to run along the south side of Kensington Gardens beneath Kensington Road , Kensington Gore and Knightsbridge . Stations were to be constructed at the Royal Albert Hall and the junction of Knightsbridge and Sloane Street , where the Brompton & Piccadilly Circus Railway ( B & PCR ) already had permission to build a station . From Sloane Street , the CLR 's proposed route ran below that approved for the B & PCR under the eastern portion of Knightsbridge , under Hyde Park Corner and along Piccadilly to Piccadilly Circus . At Hyde Park Corner , a CLR station was to be sited close to the B & PCR 's station and the CLR 's next station at St James 's Street was a short distance to the east of the B & PCR 's planned Dover Street station . At Piccadilly Circus , the CLR planned an interchange with the partially completed station of the stalled Baker Street and Waterloo Railway . The CLR route was then to turn south @-@ east beneath Leicester Square to a station at Charing Cross and then north @-@ east under Strand to Norfolk Street to interchange with the planned terminus of the Great Northern & Strand Railway . 
 The route was then to continue east under Fleet Street to Ludgate Circus for an interchange with the South Eastern and Chatham Railway 's ( SECR 's ) Ludgate Hill station , then south under New Bridge Street , and east into Queen Victoria Street where a station was planned to connect to the District Railway 's Mansion House station . The route was then to continue under Queen Victoria Street to reach the CLR 's station at Bank , where separate platforms below the existing ones were to be provided . The final section of the route developed on the proposed loop from the year before with tunnels winding under the City 's narrow , twisting streets . The tunnels were to run east , one below the other , beneath Cornhill and Leadenhall Street , north under St Mary Axe and west to Liverpool Street station , then south under Blomfield Street , east under Great Winchester Street , south under Austin Friars and Old Broad Street and west under Threadneedle Street where the tunnels were to connect with the existing sidings back into Bank . Two stations were to be provided on the loop ; at the south end of St Mary Axe and at Liverpool Street station . To accommodate the additional rolling stock needed to operate the longer line , the depot was to be extended northwards . The power station was also to be enlarged to increase the electricity supply . The CLR estimated that its plan would cost £ 3 @,@ 781 @,@ 000 ( approximately £ 370 million today ) : £ 2 @,@ 110 @,@ 000 for construction , £ 873 @,@ 000 for land and £ 798 @,@ 000 for electrical equipment and trains . 
 The CLR bill was one of many presented for the 1902 parliamentary session ( including several for the Hammersmith to City route ) and it was examined by another joint committee under Lord Windsor . The proposal received support from the mainline railway companies the route interchanged with and from the C & SLR , which had a station at Bank . The London County Council and the City Corporation also supported the plan . The Metropolitan Railway opposed , seeing further competition to its services on the Inner Circle . Questions were raised in Parliament about the safety of tunnelling so close to the vaults of many City banks and the risk that subsidence might cause vault doors to jam shut . Another concern was the danger of undermining the foundations of the Dutch Church in Austin Friars . The Windsor committee rejected the section between Shepherd 's Bush and Bank , preferring a competing route from the J. P. Morgan @-@ backed Piccadilly , City and North East London Railway ( PC & NELR ) . Without the main part of its new route , the CLR withdrew the City loop , leaving a few improvements to the existing line to be approved in the Central London Railway Act , 1902 on 31 July 1902 . 
 In late 1902 , the PC & NELR plans collapsed after a falling out between the scheme 's promoters led to a crucial part of the planned route coming under the control of a rival , the Underground Electric Railways Company of London ( UERL ) , which withdrew it from parliamentary consideration . With the PC & NELR scheme out of the way , the CLR resubmitted its bill in 1903 , although consideration was again held up by Parliament 's establishment of a Royal Commission on London Traffic tasked to assess the manner in which transport in London should be developed . While the Commission deliberated , any review of bills for new lines and extensions was postponed , so the CLR withdrew the bill . The CLR briefly re @-@ presented the bill for the 1905 parliamentary session but withdrew it again , before making an agreement with the UERL in October 1905 that neither company would submit a bill for an east – west route in 1906 . The plan was then dropped as the new trains with driving positions at both ends made it possible for the CLR to reduce the minimum interval between trains to two minutes without building the loop . 
 = = = Wood Lane , 1906 – 08 = = = 
 In 1905 , the government announced plans to hold an international exhibition to celebrate the Entente cordiale signed by France and Britain in 1904 . The location of the Franco @-@ British Exhibition 's White City site was across Wood Lane from the CLR 's depot . To exploit the opportunity to carry visitors to the exhibition , the CLR announced a bill in November 1906 seeking to create a loop from Shepherd 's Bush station and back , on which a new Wood Lane station close to the exhibition 's entrance would be built . The new work was approved on 26 July 1907 in the Central London Railway Act , 1907 . 
 The new loop was formed by constructing a section of tunnel joining the end of the dead @-@ end reversing tunnel to the west of Shepherd 's Bush station and the north side of the depot . From Shepherd 's Bush , trains ran anti @-@ clockwise around the single track loop , first through the original depot access tunnel , then passed the north side of the depot and through the new station before entering the new section of tunnel and returning to Shepherd 's Bush . Changes were also made to the depot layout to accommodate the new station and the new looped operations . Construction work on the exhibition site had started in January 1907 , and the exhibition and new station opened on 14 May 1908 . The station was on the surface between the two tunnel openings and was a basic design by Harry Bell Measures . It had platforms both sides of the curving track – passengers alighted on to one and boarded from the other ( an arrangement now known as the Spanish solution ) . 
 = = = Liverpool Street , 1908 – 12 = = = 
 With the extension to Wood Lane operational , the CLR revisited its earlier plan for an eastward extension from Bank to Liverpool Street station . This time , the Great Eastern Railway agreed to allow the CLR to build a station under its own main line terminus , provided that no further extension would be made north or north @-@ east from there – territory served by the GER 's routes from Liverpool Street . A bill was announced in November 1908 , for the 1909 parliamentary session and received Royal Assent as the Central London Railway Act , 1909 on 16 August 1909 . Construction started in July 1910 and the new Liverpool Street station was opened on 28 July 1912 . Following their successful introduction at the DR 's Earl 's Court station in 1911 , the station was the first underground station in London to be built with escalators . Four were provided , two to Liverpool Street station and two to the North London Railway 's adjacent Broad Street station . 
 = = = Ealing Broadway , 1911 – 20 = = = 
 The CLR 's next planned extension was westward to Ealing . In 1905 , the Great Western Railway ( GWR ) had obtained parliamentary approval to construct the Ealing and Shepherd 's Bush Railway ( E & SBR ) , connecting its main line route at Ealing Broadway to the West London Railway ( WLR ) north of Shepherd 's Bush . From Ealing , the new line was to curve north @-@ east through still mostly rural North Acton , then run east for a short distance parallel with the GWR 's High Wycombe line , before curving south @-@ east . The line was then to run on an embankment south of Old Oak Common and Wormwood Scrubs before connecting to the WLR a short distance to the north of the CLR 's depot . 
 Construction work did not begin immediately , and , in 1911 , the CLR and GWR agreed running powers for CLR services over the line to Ealing Broadway . To make a connection to the E & SBR , the CLR obtained parliamentary permission for a short extension northward from Wood Lane station on 18 August 1911 in the Central London Railway Act , 1911 . The new E & SBR line was constructed by the GWR and opened as a steam @-@ hauled freight only line on 16 April 1917 . Electrification of the track and the start of CLR services were postponed until after the end of World War I , not starting until 3 August 1920 when a single intermediate station at East Acton was also opened . 
 Wood Lane station was modified and extended to accommodate the northward extension tracks linking to the E & SBR . The existing platforms on the loop were retained , continuing to be used by trains that were turning back to central London , and two new platforms for trains running to or from Ealing were constructed at a lower level on the new tracks , which connected to each side of the loop . Ealing Broadway station was modified to provide additional platforms for CLR use between the existing but separate sets of platforms used by the GWR and the DR. 
 To provide services over the 6 @.@ 97 @-@ kilometre ( 4 @.@ 33 mi ) extension , the CLR ordered 24 additional driving motor carriages from the Brush Company , which , when delivered in 1917 , were first borrowed by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway for use in place of carriages ordered for its extension to Watford Junction . The new carriages were the first for tube @-@ sized trains that were fully enclosed , without gated platforms at the rear , and were provided with hinged doors in the sides to speed @-@ up passenger loading times . To operate with the new stock the CLR converted 48 existing carriages , providing a total of 72 carriages for twelve six @-@ car trains . Modifications made while in use on the Watford extension meant that the new carriages were not compatible with the rest of the CLR 's fleet and they became known as the Ealing stock . 
 The E & SBR remained part of the GWR until nationalisation at the beginning of 1948 , when ( with the exception of Ealing Broadway station ) it was transferred to the London Transport Executive . Ealing Broadway remained part of British Railways , as successors to the GWR . 
 = = = Richmond , 1913 and 1920 = = = 
 In November 1912 , the CLR announced plans for an extension from Shepherd 's Bush on a new south @-@ westwards route . Tunnels were planned under Goldhawk Road , Stamford Brook Road and Bath Road to Chiswick Common where a turn to the south would take the tunnels under Turnham Green Terrace for a short distance . The route then was to head west again to continue under Chiswick High Road before coming to the surface east of the London and South Western Railway 's ( L & SWR 's ) Gunnersbury station . Here a connection would be made to allow the CLR 's tube trains to run south @-@ west to Richmond station over L & SWR tracks that the DR shared and had electrified in 1905 . Stations were planned on Goldhawk Road at its junctions with The Grove , <unk> Road and <unk> Road , at Emlyn Road on Stamford Brook Road , at Turnham Green Terrace ( for a connection with the L & SWR 's / DR 's Turnham Green station ) and at the junction of Chiswick High Road and Heathfield Terrace . Beyond Richmond , the CLR saw further opportunities to continue over L & SWR tracks to the commuter towns of Twickenham , Sunbury and Shepperton , although this required the tracks to be electrified . The CLR received permission for the new line to Gunnersbury on 15 August 1913 in the Central London Railway Act , 1913 , but World War I prevented the works from commencing and the permission expired . 
 In November 1919 , the CLR published a new bill to revive the Richmond extension , but using a different route that required only a short section of new tunnel construction . The new proposal was to construct tunnels southwards from Shepherd 's Bush station , which would come to the surface to connect to disused L & SWR tracks north of Hammersmith Grove Road station that had closed in 1916 . From Hammersmith , the disused LS & WR tracks continued westwards , on the same viaduct as the DR 's tracks through Turnham Green to Gunnersbury and Richmond . The plan required electrification of the disused tracks , but avoided the need for costly tunnelling and would have shared the existing stations on the route with the DR. The plan received assent on 4 August 1920 as part of the Central London and Metropolitan District Railway Companies ( Works ) Act , 1920 , although the CLR made no attempt to carry out any of the work . The disused L & SWR tracks between Ravenscourt Park and Turnham Green were eventually used for the westward extension of the Piccadilly line from Hammersmith in 1932 . 
 = = Competition , co @-@ operation and sale , 1906 – 13 = = 
 From 1906 the CLR began to experience a large fall in passenger numbers caused by increased competition from the DR and the MR , which electrified the Inner Circle in 1905 , and from the Great Northern , Piccadilly and Brompton Railway ( GNP & BR ) which opened its rival route to Hammersmith in 1906 . Road traffic also offered a greater challenge as motor buses began replacing the horse drawn variety in greater numbers . In an attempt to maintain income , the company increased the flat fare for longer journeys to three pence in July 1907 and reduced the fare for shorter journeys to one penny in March 1909 . Multiple booklets of tickets , which had previously been sold at face value , were offered at discounts , and season tickets were introduced from July 1911 . 
 The CLR looked to economise through the use of technological developments . The introduction in 1909 of dead @-@ man 's handles to the driver controls and " trip cocks " devices on signals and trains meant that the assistant driver was no longer required as a safety measure . Signalling automation allowed the closure of many of the line 's 16 signal boxes and a reduction in signalling staff . From 1911 , the CLR operated a parcel service , making modifications to the driving cars of four trains to provide a compartment in which parcels could be sorted . These were collected at each station and distributed to their destinations by a team of tricycle riding delivery boys . The service made a small profit , but ended in 1917 because of wartime labour shortages . 
 The problem of declining revenues was not limited to the CLR ; all of London 's tube lines and the sub @-@ surface DR and MR were affected by competition to some degree . The reduced income from the lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the companies to pay back borrowed capital , or to pay dividends to shareholders . The CLR 's dividend payments fell to 3 per cent from 1905 , but those of the UERL 's lines were as low as 0 @.@ 75 per cent . From 1907 , the CLR , the UERL , the C & SLR , and the Great Northern & City Railway companies began to introduce fare agreements . From 1908 , they began to present themselves through common branding as the Underground . In November 1912 , after secret take @-@ over talks , the UERL announced that it was purchasing the CLR , swapping one of its own shares for each of the CLR 's . The take @-@ over took effect on 1 January 1913 , although the CLR company remained legally separate from the UERL 's other tube lines . 
 = = Improvements and integration , 1920 – 33 = = 
 Following the takeover , the UERL took steps to integrate the CLR 's operations with its own . The CLR 's power station was closed in March 1928 with power instead being supplied from the UERL 's Lots Road Power Station in Chelsea . <unk> stations were modernised ; Bank and Shepherd 's Bush stations received escalators in 1924 , Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Circus in 1925 and Bond Street in 1926 , which also received a new entrance designed by Charles Holden . Chancery Lane and Marble Arch stations were also rebuilt to receive escalators in the early 1930s . 
 On 5 November 1923 new stations were opened on the Ealing extension at North Acton and West Acton . They were built to serve residential and industrial developments around Park Royal and , like East Acton , the station buildings were basic structures with simple timber shelters on the platforms . The poor location of British Museum station and the lack of an interchange with the GNP & BR 's station at Holborn had been a considered a problem by the CLR almost since the opening of the GNP & BR in 1906 . A pedestrian subway to link the stations was considered in 1907 , but not carried out . A proposal to enlarge the tunnels under High Holborn to create new platforms at Holborn station for the CLR and to abandon British Museum station was included in a CLR bill submitted to parliament in November 1913 . This was given assent in 1914 , but World War I prevented any works taking place , and it was not until 1930 that the UERL revived the powers and began construction work . The new platforms , along with a new ticket hall and escalators to both lines , opened on 25 September 1933 , British Museum station having closed at the end of traffic the day before . 
 Between March 1926 and September 1928 , the CLR converted the remaining gate stock carriages in phases . The end platforms were enclosed to provide additional passenger accommodation and two sliding doors were inserting in each side . The conversions increased capacity and allowed the CLR to remove <unk> from the train crews , with responsibility for controlling doors moving to the two guards who each managed half the train . Finally , the introduction of driver / guard communications in 1928 allowed the CLR to dispense with the second guard , reducing a train crew to just a driver and a guard . The addition of doors in the sides of cars caused problems at Wood Lane where the length of the platform on the inside of the returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into the depot . The problem was solved by the introduction of a pivoted section of platform which usually sat above the access track and allowed passengers to board trains as normal , but which could be moved to allow access to the depot . 
 = = Move to public ownership , 1923 – 33 = = 
 Despite closer co @-@ operation and improvements made to the CLR stations and to other parts of the network , the Underground railways continued to struggle financially . The UERL 's ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company ( LGOC ) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group , through the pooling of revenues , to use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways . However , competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole UERL group . 
 To protect the UERL group 's income , its chairman Lord Ashfield lobbied the government for regulation of transport services in the London area . Starting in 1923 , a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction , with Ashfield and Labour London County Councillor ( later MP and Minister of Transport ) Herbert Morrison , at the forefront of debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought . Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the LCC 's tram system ; Morrison preferred full public ownership . After seven years of false starts , a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board ( LPTB ) , a public corporation that would take control of the UERL , the MR and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the London Passenger Transport Area . The Board was a compromise – public ownership but not full nationalisation – and came into existence on 1 July 1933 . On this date , ownership of the assets of the CLR and the other Underground companies transferred to the LPTB . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 For a history of the line after 1933 see Central line 
 In 1935 the LPTB announced plans as part of its New Works Programme to extend the CLR at both ends by taking over and electrifying local routes owned by the GWR in Middlesex and Buckinghamshire and by the LNER in east London and Essex . Work in the tunnels to lengthen platforms for longer trains and to correct misaligned tunnel sections that slowed running speeds was also carried out . A new station was planned to replace the cramped Wood Lane . The service from North Acton through Greenford and Ruislip to Denham was due to open between January 1940 and March 1941 . The eastern extension from Liverpool Street to Stratford , Leyton and Newbury Park and the connection to the LNER lines to Hainault , Epping and Ongar were intended to open in 1940 and 1941 . World War II caused works on both extensions to be halted and London Underground services were extended in stages from 1946 to 1949 , although the final section from West Ruislip to Denham was cancelled . Following the LPTB take over , the Harry Beck @-@ designed tube map began to show the route 's name as the " Central London Line " instead of " Central London Railway " . In anticipation of the extensions taking its services far beyond the boundaries of the County of London , " London " was omitted from the name on 23 August 1937 ; thereafter it was simply the " Central line " . The CLR 's original tunnels form the core of the Central line 's 72 @.@ 17 @-@ kilometre ( 44 @.@ 84 mi ) route . 
 During World War II , 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) of completed tube tunnels built for the eastern extension between Gants Hill and Redbridge were used as a factory by Plessey to manufacture electronic parts for aircraft . Other completed tunnels were used as air @-@ raid shelters at Liverpool Street , Bethnal Green and between Stratford and Leyton , as were the closed parts of British Museum station At Chancery Lane , new tunnels 16 feet 6 inches ( 5 @.@ 03 m ) in diameter and 1 @,@ 200 feet ( 370 m ) long were constructed below the running tunnels during 1941 and early 1942 . These were fitted out as a deep level shelter for government use as a protected communications centre . Work on a similar shelter was planned at Post Office station ( renamed St Paul 's in 1937 ) but was cancelled ; the lift shafts that were made redundant when the station was given escalators in January 1939 were converted for use as a protected control centre for the Central Electricity Board . 
 = Condemnations of 1210 – 1277 = 
 The Condemnations at the medieval University of Paris were enacted to restrict certain teachings as being heretical . These included a number of medieval theological teachings , but most importantly the physical treatises of Aristotle . The investigations of these teachings were conducted by the Bishops of Paris . The Condemnations of 1277 are traditionally linked to an investigation requested by Pope John XXI , although whether he actually supported drawing up a list of condemnations is unclear . 
 Approximately sixteen lists of censured theses were issued by the University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries . Most of these lists of propositions were put together into systematic collections of prohibited articles . Of these , the Condemnations of 1277 are considered particularly important by those historians who consider that they had a side effect of encouraging scholars to question the tenets of Aristotelian science . From this perspective , some revisionist historians maintain that the condemnations had positive effects on the development of science , perhaps even representing the beginnings of modern science . 
 = = Condemnation of 1210 = = 
 The Condemnation of 1210 was issued by the provincial synod of Sens , which included the Bishop of Paris as a member ( at the time Peter of Nemours ) . The writings of a number of medieval scholars were condemned , apparently for pantheism , and it was further stated that : " Neither the books of Aristotle on natural philosophy or their commentaries are to be read at Paris in public or secret , and this we forbid under penalty of excommunication . " However , this had only local force , and its application was further restricted to the Arts faculty at the University of Paris . Theologians were therefore left free to read the prohibited works , the titles of which were not even specified . Alexander of Aphrodisias was probably among the Aristotelian commentators whose influence was targeted . 
 The University of Toulouse ( founded in 1229 ) tried to capitalise on the situation by advertising itself to students : " Those who wish to scrutinize the bosom of nature to the inmost can hear the books of Aristotle which were forbidden at Paris . " However , whether the prohibition had actually had an effect on the study of the physical texts in Paris is unclear . English scholars , including Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon , studied at Paris , when they could have chosen to study at the University of Oxford , where the works could still be discussed in public . It is assumed that at the least they continued to be read in Paris in private , and there are also signs that their discussion had become public by 1240 . 
 = = Condemnation of 1270 = = 
 By 1270 , the ban on Aristotle 's natural philosophy was a dead letter . Nevertheless , the Bishop of Paris , Étienne Tempier , convened a meeting of conservative theologians and in December 1270 banned the teaching of certain Aristotelian and Averroist doctrines at Paris . Thirteen propositions were listed as false and heretical , some relating to Averroes ' doctrine of the soul and the doctrine of <unk> , and others directed against Aristotle 's theory of God as a passive Unmoved Mover . The banned propositions included :

 Those who " knowingly " taught or asserted them as true would suffer automatic excommunication , with the implied threat of the medieval Inquisition if they persisted . It is not known which of these statements were " taught knowingly " or " asserted " by teachers at Paris , although <unk> of Brabant and his radical Averroist colleagues at the Faculty of Arts were targets . Evidently , the radical masters had taught that Aristotle put forward controversial propositions — which according to the <unk> would have been true at least in philosophy , even if rejected in theology - the doctrine of two truths — and questions such as free will and the immortality of the soul were doubtless subject to scholarly debate between masters and students . However , it seems " inconceivable " that any teacher would deny God 's Providence or present the Aristotelian " Unmoved Mover " as the true God . 
 = = Condemnation of 1277 = = 
 The chain of events leading up to Bishop Tempier 's condemnation of 1277 is still not entirely clear . The Catholic Encyclopedia records that the theologians of the University of Paris had been very uneasy due to the antagonism that existed between Christian dogmas and certain Peripatetic doctrines . According to the historian Edward Grant , the theologians desired to condemn Aristotle 's teachings on the eternity of the world and the unicity of the intellect . 
 On 18 January 1277 , Pope John XXI instructed Bishop Tempier to investigate the complaints of the theologians . " Not only did Tempier investigate but in only three weeks , on his own authority , he issued a condemnation of 219 propositions drawn from many sources , including , apparently , the works of Thomas Aquinas , some of whose ideas found their way onto the list . " The list published on 7 March condemned a great number of " errors " , some of which emanated from the astrology , and others from the philosophy of the <unk> . These included : 
 9 . " That there was no first man , nor will there be a last ; on the contrary , there always was and always will be generation of man from man . " 
 49 . " That God could not move the heavens with rectilinear motion ; and the reason is that a vacuum would remain . " 
 87 . " That the world is eternal as to all the species contained in it ; and that time is eternal , as are motion , matter , agent , and recipient ; and because the world is from the infinite power of God , it is impossible that there be novelty in an effect without novelty in the cause . " 
 The penalty for anyone teaching or listening to the listed errors was excommunication , " unless they turned themselves in to the bishop or the chancellor within seven days , in which case the bishop would inflict proportionate penalties . " The condemnation sought to stop the Master of Arts teachers from interpreting the works of Aristotle in ways that were contrary to the beliefs of the Church . In addition to the 219 errors , the condemnation also covered Andreas <unk> 's De amore , and unnamed or unidentified treatises on geomancy , necromancy , witchcraft , or <unk> . 
 The condemnation of 1277 was later partially annulled " insofar as the teachings of Thomas Aquinas would seem to be implied . " 
 = = = Assessment = = = 
 The long list has often been labelled as not being particularly organised , and that it is " broad in scope to the point of confusion . " However , the order on the roll has been attributed to factors such as the order in which the errors appeared in the examined works . The list was reorganised shortly after 1277 , possibly to facilitate its use in the academic community . In the 20th century , the articles were once again reorganised by Pierre <unk> , numbering and distinguishing the 179 philosophical theses from the 40 theological ones . The list was summarised into groupings and further explained by John F. <unk> . It has also been emphasised by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy that " Tempier 's theses express positions that cannot be maintained in light of revealed truth , and for this reason are each followed by the qualification ' error ' . " 
 Another problem was that Tempier did not identify the targets of his condemnation , merely indicating that it was directed against unspecified members of the Arts Faculty in Paris . <unk> of Brabant and Boethius of Dacia have been singled out as the most prominent targets of the 1277 censure , even though their names are not found in the document itself , appearing instead in the rubrics of only two of the many manuscripts that preserve the condemnation . These two scholars were important proponents of the Averroist movement . The ground @-@ breaking study by the historian Roland <unk> has shown that many of the censured propositions appear to have come from Aristotle , from Arab philosophers , or from " the philosophers " ( i.e. other Greek philosophers ) . 
 The role that Pope John XXI played in the lead up to the condemnations is a more recent point of discussion . Because the papal letter preceded Tempier 's condemnation by only about six weeks , the traditional assumption was that Tempier had acted on papal initiative , and in an overzealous and hasty way . However , more than forty days after Tempier produced his list , another papal letter gives no indication that the Pope was as yet aware of Tempier 's action , and seems to suggest otherwise . It is therefore possible that Tempier had already been preparing his condemnations prior to receiving the Pope 's first letter . The Pope himself had not played any direct role in the condemnations , having merely requested an investigation , and one scholar has argued that there was " less than enthusiastic papal approval of the bishop of Paris ' actions . " 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 Pierre Duhem considered that these condemnations " destroyed certain essential foundations of Peripatetic physics " . Although the Aristotelian system viewed propositions such as the existence of a vacuum to be ridiculously untenable , belief in Divine Omnipotence sanctioned them as possible , whilst waiting for science to confirm them as true . From at least 1280 onward , many masters at Paris and Oxford admitted that the laws of nature are certainly opposed to the production of empty space , but that the realisation of such a space is not , in itself , contrary to reason . These arguments gave rise to the branch of mechanical science known as dynamics . 
 Pierre Duhem and Edward Grant state this caused a break from Aristotle ’ s work and forced the teachers of the time to believe Aristotle ’ s work imperfect . According to Duhem , " if we must assign a date for the birth of modern science , we would , without doubt , choose the year 1277 when the bishop of Paris solemnly proclaimed that several worlds could exist , and that the whole of heavens could , without contradiction , be moved with a rectilinear motion . " 
 Duhem 's view has been extremely influential in the historiography of medieval science , and opened it up as a serious academic discipline . " Duhem believed that Tempier , with his insistence of God 's absolute power , had liberated Christian thought from the dogmatic acceptance of <unk> , and in this way marked the birth of modern science . " The condemnations certainly had a positive effect on science , but scholars disagree over their relative influence . Historians in the field no longer fully endorse his view that modern science started in 1277 . Edward Grant is probably the contemporary historian of science who comes closest to Duhem 's vision . What historians do agree upon is that the condemnations allowed science " to consider possibilities that the great philosopher never envisioned . " According to the historian of science Richard Dales , they " seem definitely to have promoted a freer and more imaginative way of doing science . " 
 Others point out that in philosophy , a critical and skeptical reaction followed on from the Condemnations 1277 . Since the theologians had asserted that Aristotle had erred in theology , and pointed out the negative consequences of uncritical acceptance of his ideas , scholastic philosophers such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham ( both Franciscan friars ) believed he might also be mistaken in matters of philosophy . The <unk> and <unk> movements set Scholasticism on a different path from that of Albert the Great and Aquinas , and the theological motivation of their philosophical arguments can be traced back to 1277 . They stressed the traditional Franciscan themes of Divine Omnipotence and Divine Freedom , which formed part of Ockham 's first thesis . 
 Ockham 's second thesis was the principle of parsimony : also known as Ockham 's razor . This developed a new form of logic , based on an empiricist theory of knowledge . " While Scholastic in setting , " as David Lindberg writes , it was " thoroughly modern in orientation . Referred to as the via <unk> , in opposition to the via antiqua of the earlier scholastics , it has been seen as a forerunner of a modern age of analysis . " Other , even more skeptical thinkers in the mid @-@ 14th century included John of <unk> and Nicholas of <unk> . It has been suggested that the new philosophy of nature that emerged from the rise of Skepticism following the Condemnations , contained " the seeds from which modern science could arise in the early seventeenth century .

 = Olivia Manning = 
 Olivia Mary Manning CBE ( 2 March 1908 – 23 July 1980 ) was a British novelist , poet , writer and reviewer . Her fiction and non @-@ fiction , frequently detailing journeys and personal odysseys , were principally set in England , Ireland , Europe and the Middle East . She often wrote from her personal experience , though her books also demonstrate strengths in imaginative writing . Her books are widely admired for her artistic eye and vivid descriptions of place . 
 Manning 's youth was divided between Portsmouth and Ireland , giving her what she described as " the usual Anglo @-@ Irish sense of belonging nowhere " . She attended art school , and moved to London , where her first serious novel , The Wind Changes , was published in 1937 . In August 1939 she married R. D. Smith ( " Reggie " ) , a British Council lecturer posted in Bucharest , Romania , and subsequently in Greece , Egypt and Palestine as the Nazis overran Eastern Europe . Her experiences formed the basis for her best known work , the six novels making up The Balkan Trilogy and The Levant Trilogy , known collectively as Fortunes of War . The overall quality of her output was considered uneven by critics , but this series , published between 1960 and 1980 , was described by Anthony Burgess as " the finest fictional record of the war produced by a British writer " . 
 Manning returned to London after the war and lived there until her death , writing poetry , short stories , novels , non @-@ fiction , reviews , and drama for the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) . Both Manning and her husband had affairs , but they never contemplated divorce . Her relationships with writers such as Stevie Smith and Iris Murdoch were difficult , as an insecure Manning was jealous of their greater success . Her constant grumbling about all manner of subjects is reflected in her nickname , " Olivia Moaning " , but Reggie never wavered in his role as his wife 's principal supporter and encourager , confident that her talent would ultimately be recognised . As she had feared , real fame only came after her death in 1980 , when an adaptation of Fortunes of War was televised in 1987 . 
 Manning 's books have received limited critical attention ; as during her life , opinions are divided , particularly about her characterisation and portrayal of other cultures . Her works tend to minimise issues of gender , and are not easily classified as feminist literature . Nevertheless , recent scholarship has highlighted Manning 's importance as a woman writer of war fiction and of the British Empire in decline . Her works are critical of war , racism , colonialism and imperialism , and examine themes of displacement and physical and emotional alienation . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Olivia Manning was born in North End , Portsmouth on 2 March 1908 . Her father , Oliver Manning , was a naval officer who rose from naval trainee to lieutenant @-@ commander despite a lack of formal schooling . At the age of 45 , while visiting the port of Belfast , he met Olivia Morrow , a publican 's daughter fourteen years his junior ; they married less than a month later in December 1904 , in the Presbyterian church in her home town of Bangor , County Down . 
 Manning adored her lively , handsome , womanising father who entertained others by singing Gilbert and Sullivan and reciting poetry he had memorised during long sea voyages . In contrast , her mother was bossy and domineering , with a " mind as rigid as cast @-@ iron " , and there were constant marital disputes . The initially warm relationship between mother and daughter became strained after the birth of Manning 's brother Oliver in 1913 ; delicate and frequently ill , he was the centre of his mother 's attention , much to the displeasure of Manning , who made several childish attempts to harm him . This unhappy , insecure childhood left a lasting mark on her work and personality . 
 Manning was educated privately at a small dame school before moving to the north of Ireland in 1916 , the first of several extended periods spent there while her father was at sea . In Bangor she attended Bangor Presbyterian School , and while in Portsmouth Lyndon House School , and subsequently Portsmouth Grammar School , developing , as she recalled , " the usual Anglo @-@ Irish sense of belonging nowhere " . <unk> described her as shy and prone to tantrums ; her tendency to tell boastful tall @-@ tales about her family led to ostracism by her peers . Supported by her father , Manning read and wrote extensively , preferring novels , especially those by H. Rider Haggard . Her mother discouraged such pursuits , and confiscated material she thought unsuitable ; when she found her daughter reading the Times Literary Supplement she scolded that " young men do not like women who read papers like that " , and that Manning should focus on marketable job skills , such as typing . 
 Indeed , when financial circumstances forced Manning to leave school at sixteen , she worked as a typist , and spent some time as a junior in a beauty salon . A talented artist , she took evening classes at the Portsmouth Municipal School of Art , where a fellow student described her as intellectual and aloof . In May 1928 , she had a painting selected for an exhibition at Southsea , and was subsequently offered a one @-@ woman show of her works . Manning seemed to be poised for a career as an artist , but she had meanwhile continued her interest in literature , and at the age of twenty determined instead to be a writer . Her artist 's eye is apparent in her later intense descriptions of landscapes . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Manning 's first published works were three serialised detective novels , Rose of Rubies , Here is Murder and The Black Scarab which appeared in the Portsmouth News beginning in 1929 under the pseudonym Jacob Morrow . Manning did not acknowledge these books until the 1960s ; their publication dates might have given away her age , a secret she kept even from her husband . Between 1929 and 1935 she wrote about 20 short stories , including a ghost story that was the first work to be published under her own name , though using initials to obscure her gender . Manning also wrote two literary novels , neither of which was accepted for publication . However , her second manuscript sufficiently impressed Edward Garnett , a literary editor at Jonathan Cape , that he asked his assistant Hamish Miles to write her a note of encouragement . Miles , a respected and well @-@ connected literary adviser and translator in his late thirties , invited Manning to visit if she were ever in London . Manning , feeling stifled in Portsmouth , had already made efforts to move to the capital , but her meeting with Miles made her more determined . She succeeded in obtaining a typing job at Peter Jones , the department store , and , despite opposition from her mother , moved into a run @-@ down bed @-@ sitting room in Chelsea . 
 Short of food and money , Manning spent long hours writing after work . Miles took Manning under his wing , dazzling her with dinners , literary conversation and gossip , and providing unaccustomed support . A married man with two children , he told Manning that his wife was an invalid and no longer able to tolerate sex ; they soon became lovers . Manning later recalled that " sex for both of them was the motivating charm of life . " 
 A case of mistaken identity involving an artist with a similar name led Manning to a better @-@ paid job <unk> furniture , at which she worked for more than two years , still writing in her spare time . She recalled this as " one of the happiest seasons " of her life . With Miles ' encouragement she completed a novel , The Wind Changes , and saw it published by Jonathan Cape in April 1937 . The novel , set in Dublin in June 1921 during the Irish War of Independence , revolved around a woman torn between an Irish patriot and an English writer with pro @-@ Republican sympathies . It was well received , with one reviewer commenting that " the novel shows unusual promise " . Soon after , however , Miles learnt that he had an inoperable brain tumour , and disappeared from Manning 's life . Since the affair had been kept secret she had difficulty obtaining information about him , and could not afford to visit him in the Edinburgh hospital where he lay dying . She lost her job at Peter Jones , moved to a well @-@ paid job at the Medici Society , but was sacked when she refused her boss 's order to give up novel @-@ writing in the evening so as to conserve her energy for the day job . Manning obtained other work assessing new novels for their potential as films for Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer , but by the time she had saved sufficient money for a trip to Edinburgh , Miles was too ill to see her . He died in December 1937 . 
 Miles did not normally introduce his literary friends to each other , but before his death he had been forced by circumstance to introduce Manning to the poet Stevie Smith . The two developed an immediate rapport and enjoyed exploring London 's backstreets , with regular outings to museums , cinema , and visits to the Palmers Green home that Smith shared with an eccentric aunt . According to a mutual friend , Manning found in Smith 's home " an atmosphere of security and comfort which must have made her room in Oakley Street seem even <unk> and more threadbare . " The novelist and critic Walter Allen met Manning in 1937 and observed that she had a " devastating " wit " and was as formidable a young woman as any in London " . Manning and Smith , he added , were a malicious pair of snobs . 
 = = Marriage and Romania = = 
 In July 1939 , Walter Allen introduced Manning to the charming Marxist R. D. " Reggie " Smith . Reggie was a large , energetic man , possessed of a constant desire for the company of others . The son of a Manchester <unk> , he had studied at Birmingham University , where he had been coached by the left @-@ wing poet Louis McNeice and founded the Birmingham Socialist Society . According to the British intelligence organisation MI5 , Reggie had been recruited as a communist spy by Anthony Blunt on a visit to Cambridge University in 1938 . 
 When he met Manning , Reggie was on leave from his British Council position as a lecturer in Romania . He had diligently prepared himself for the introduction to Manning by reading her works , and felt that her book The Wind Changes showed " signs of genius " . He described Manning as a jolie laide , possessing lovely hair , hands , eyes and skin though an overlong nose , and fell in love at first sight . When he borrowed a half @-@ crown from her on their first meeting , and repaid it the next day , he knew they would marry . Manning was less certain of the relationship , but Reggie quickly moved into her flat , proposing in bed a few weeks later . They were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 18 August 1939 , with Stevie Smith and Louis McNeice as witnesses . The bridegroom , unconventionally and true to form , did not produce a ring for the ceremony . A few days after the wedding , the couple received word that Reggie had been recalled to Bucharest . They left within a matter of hours ; Manning later wrote to Stevie Smith from Romania asking her to find out what had happened to their flat and to take care of her books while she was away . The couple travelled by train to Bucharest , arriving on 3 September 1939 , the day Britain declared war on Germany . Between the two world wars , Romania had looked to France to guarantee its security against German territorial aspirations . However , the impact of the Munich Agreement ( 1938 ) , the German @-@ Soviet Non @-@ Aggression Pact ( 1939 ) , and the Fall of France ( 1940 ) increased German influence and control over the country , and included demands that Romania cede territory and resources . The couple 's time in Bucharest coincided with the rise of fascist and totalitarian power within ostensibly neutral Romania , while war threatened from without , driving thousands of refugees within its borders . 
 The Smiths initially rented a flat , but later moved in with the diplomat Adam Watson , who was working with the British Legation . Those who knew Manning at the time described her as a shy , provincial girl who had little experience with other cultures . She was both dazzled and appalled by Romania . The café society , with its wit and gossip , appealed to her , but she was repelled by the peasantry and the aggressive , often mutilated , beggars . Her Roumanian experiences were captured in the first two volumes of The Balkan Trilogy ( The Great Fortune and The Spoilt City ) , considered one of the most important literary treatments of Romania during the war . In her novels , Manning described Bucharest as being on the margins of European civilisation , " a strange , half @-@ Oriental capital " that was " primitive , bug @-@ ridden and brutal " , whose citizens were peasants , whatever their wealth or status . 
 Manning spent her days writing ; her main project was a book about Henry Morton Stanley and his search for Emin Pasha , but she also maintained an intimate correspondence with Stevie Smith , which was full of Bloomsbury gossip and intrigue . She undertook a dangerous journalistic assignment to interview the former Romanian Prime Minister Iuliu Maniu in Cluj , Transylvania , at the time full of German troops , and soon to be transferred by Romania to Hungary as part of the Second Vienna Award of August 1940 , imposed by the Germans and Italians . Like many of her experiences , the interview was to be incorporated into a future work ; others included her impromptu baptism of Reggie with cold tea because she feared being separated from him after death , and Reggie 's production of a Shakespeare play , in which she was promised a prime role that was given to another . 
 Reggie was relentlessly gregarious , and throughout his life his warmth , wit and friendliness earned him many friends and drinking companions . In contrast , Manning was reticent and uncomfortable in social settings , and remained in the background . She acted , in her own words , as a " camp @-@ follower " , trailing after Reggie as he went from bar to bar , often choosing to go home early and alone . While Manning remained faithful to Reggie during the war , their friend Ivor Porter was to report that Reggie had numerous affairs . 
 The approaching war and rise of fascism and the Iron Guard in Romania disconcerted and frightened Manning . The abdication of King Carol and the advance of the Germans in September 1940 increased her fears , and she repeatedly asked Reggie " But where will the Jews go ? " . Just before German troops entered Romania on 7 October at the invitation of the new dictator Ion Antonescu , Manning flew to Greece , followed a week later by Reggie . 
 = = Greece and Egypt = = 
 Manning was subject to anxieties bordering on paranoia throughout her life . She had good reason to be concerned about Reggie , however , who travelled from Romania to Greece on the German Lufthansa airline – Lufthansa planes were sometimes diverted to Axis countries . He arrived safely , however , bringing a rucksack , a suitcase full of books , but no appropriate clothes for work . Reggie relaunched his hectic social life , but his wife interacted little with the expatriate community , focussing instead on her writing . Nevertheless , this was a happy time for Manning ; " Romania is abroad , " said Manning , " but Greece is home " . Manning had her admirers , including Terence Spencer , a British Council lecturer who acted as her companion while Reggie was busy with other activities – he later appeared as the character Charles Warden in Friends and Heroes , the third book of The Balkan Trilogy . Soon after their arrival , Greece entered the war against the Axis . 
 In spite of early successes against invading Italian forces , by April 1941 the country was at risk of invasion from the Germans ; in a later poem Manning recalled the " horror and terror of defeat " of a people she had grown to love . The British Council advised its staff to evacuate , and on 18 April Manning and Reggie left Piraeus for Egypt on the Erebus , the last civilian ship to leave Greece . 
 For the three dangerous days of the passage to Alexandria the passengers subsisted on oranges and wine . On board with the Smiths were the novelist Robert Liddell , the Welsh poet Harold Edwards , and their wives – the Smiths shared a cramped cabin with the Edwardses . Mrs. Edwards had brought with her a hat box full of expensive Parisian hats , which Manning kept placing in the passageway outside the cabin , and from whence Mrs. Edwards kept returning it . The two were not on speaking terms by the end of the voyage , but Manning had the last word : when Mrs. Edwards later opened her <unk> she found that Manning had crushed the hats with a <unk> . 
 Arriving in Alexandria , the refugees gratefully devoured the food provided by the British military , but learned that the swastika was now flying over the Acropolis . Manning 's first impressions of Egypt were of squalor and unreality : " For weeks we lived in a state of recoil " . From Alexandria they went by train to Cairo , where they renewed contact with Adam Watson , who was now Second Secretary at the British Embassy . He invited them to stay at his Garden City flat that overlooked the embassy . 
 Though nominally an independent country , Egypt had been effectively under British control since the late nineteenth century . With the outbreak of war , and under the terms of the Anglo @-@ Egyptian Treaty of 1936 , the country was under virtual occupation by the British . At this stage in the war , the Germans were advancing apparently <unk> across the desert towards Egypt , and Cairo was rife with rumours and alarms . Manning was jittery and fearful . She was constantly anxious about illness , and was indeed frequently unwell . Concerned , Reggie suggested that it might be best if she returned to England , but she retorted " Wherever we go , we go together . If we return home , we both go . I won 't have the war separating us . End of story . " Her father had made her a firm believer in the British Empire and the benefits it had brought the world , and Manning was a patriotic Briton , confident of ultimate Allied success . In Egypt , however , she confronted the fact that British occupation had never been popular . Reggie quickly discovered the Anglo @-@ Egyptian Union in Zamalek , where he drank and talked politics and poetry . As usual he was well liked , and according to Lawrence Durrell often had a string of disreputable friends with him . Manning was much less popular . Durrell described her as a " hook @-@ nosed condor " , whose critical manner was unappreciated by many who knew her . 
 Manning was incensed that the British Council did not immediately find a job for Reggie , whom she considered one of their most brilliant teachers . She took her revenge by writing scurrilous verse about the Council 's representative , <unk> Dundas , later immortalised as the ineffectual Colin Gracey in Fortunes of War . Manning 's characters were often based on real people though she never drew precisely from life . Her mocking portrait of the British Council lecturer Professor Lord <unk> was loosely based on Lord Dunsany , sent to occupy the Byron Chair of English at Athens University in 1940 . She also resented that Amy Smart , wife of Walter Smart and frequent patron of artists , poets and writers in Cairo , paid so little attention to her and Reggie ; she later took revenge in a similar way . 
 In October 1941 , Reggie was offered a post as lecturer at Farouk University in Alexandria . The couple moved from Cairo to share a flat with fellow teacher Robert Liddell . The Germans regularly bombed the city , and the raids terrified Manning , who irritated Reggie and Liddell by insisting that all three descend to the air raid shelter whenever the sirens wailed . Almost immediately after her arrival in Alexandria came devastating news of her brother Oliver 's death in a plane crash . The emotional upset this caused prevented her from writing novels for several years . 
 The air raids became intolerable to Manning , and she soon moved back to Cairo , where in the winter of 1941 she became press attaché at the United States Legation . In her spare time , she worked on Guests at the Marriage , an unpublished prototype for The Balkan Trilogy , as well as short stories and poetry , some of which she sent to Stevie Smith in the hope of getting them published . Over the years , Stevie had brooded over Manning 's desertion of their friendship to marry Reggie , and around this time her jealousy took an overt form ; in 1942 she wrote a poem entitled " Murder " , in which a man stands beside a grave and admits , " My hand brought Reggie Smith to this strait bed – / Well , fare his soul well , fear not I the dead " . In subsequent reprintings , the name " Reggie Smith " was replaced by " Filmer Smith " , <unk> the allusion , but Manning found out and was furious . 
 During her time in Egypt , Manning became a contributor to two Middle East @-@ based literary magazines , " Desert Poets " and " Personal Landscapes " , founded by Bernard Spencer , Lawrence Durrell , and Robin Fedden . The latter sought to explore the " personal landscapes " of writers experiencing exile during the war . The founders , like Manning , maintained a strong attachment to Greece rather than an artistic and intellectual engagement with Egypt . In remembering the departure from Greece , Manning wrote " We faced the sea / Knowing until the day of our return we would be / Exiles from a country not our own . " During their time in Egypt and Palestine , Manning and her husband maintained close links with refugee Greek writers , including translating and editing the work of George Seferis and Elie <unk> . Manning described her impressions of the Cairo poetry scene in " Poets in Exile " in Cyril Connolly 's magazine Horizon . She defended the writers from the claim of a London reviewer that they were " out of touch " , suggesting that their work was strengthened by their access to other cultures , languages and writers . Her review was much critiqued by those featured , including Durrell who objected to Spencer 's poetry being praised at his expense . 
 In 1942 , Reggie was appointed as Controller of English and Arabic Programming at the Palestine Broadcasting Service in Jerusalem ; the job was to begin in the fall , but in early July , with the German troops rapidly advancing on Egypt , he persuaded Manning to go ahead to Jerusalem to " prepare the way " . 
 = = Palestine = = 
 The couple were to spend three years in Jerusalem . On arrival , Manning approached the Palestine Post for a job , and was soon appointed a reviewer . Between 1943 and 1944 she served as press assistant at Jerusalem 's Public Information office , and then moved to the same position at the British Council office in Jerusalem . Manning continued to work on her book about Stanley and Emin Pasha , and took advantage of army drivers who were willing to give lifts to civilians ; she visited Palestine , Petra and Damascus , gathering material for future works . 
 In 1944 , Manning became pregnant ; the couple were overjoyed and Manning relaxed , becoming less critical of others , including her own mother , with whom she had long had a difficult relationship . Uncharacteristically , she rested , walked , painted and even knitted . In the seventh month , however , the baby died in utero , and as was the practice at the time , Manning was obliged to wait two difficult months to deliver her dead child . " I am like a walking cemetery " , she sorrowfully repeated during this period . Grief @-@ stricken , Manning became paranoid , constantly afraid that Reggie would be assassinated . Reggie decided that she was having a nervous breakdown , and in October 1944 accompanied her to Cyprus for a month 's holiday . Returning to Jerusalem , she was still far from well , and the poet Louis Lawler noticed the discontent of this " strange and difficult woman " , and Reggie 's " wonderfully patient " behaviour , despite Manning calling her husband by his last name throughout the period . Manning never fully recovered from her loss , and was rarely to talk or write of it . She was unable to have further children and in the future directed her maternal feelings towards animals , especially cats . 
 During her time in the Middle East , Manning had picked up amoebic dysentery , which led to several admissions to hospitals in Cairo and Palestine . When the war in Europe ended in May 1945 , her state of health led the couple to decide that Manning should return to England earlier than Reggie . They travelled to Suez together , where she sailed for home alone . 
 = = Post @-@ war England = = 
 After a brief stay with her still grieving parents in heavily bombed Portsmouth , Manning moved into a London flat . Reggie arrived during the summer of 1945 , and found a job in the Features Department of the BBC . He was identified as a Communist spy by MI5 in 1947 , and placed under surveillance . According to his file , Reggie had been working to increase Soviet influence in Romania and the Middle East throughout the war . Manning did not share her husband 's political beliefs , but was quite aware that their phone was being tapped and feared that his open support for Communism would lead to him being sacked from the BBC . Reggie was soon transferred away from Features to the less politically sensitive Drama department . The surveillance stopped when he resigned from the Communist Party after the Russian invasion of Hungary in 1956 . 
 Manning also worked for the BBC ; she wrote scripts for including adaptations of novels by George Eliot , Arnold Bennett and Ada Leverson . She completed her book on Stanley and Emin Pasha , titled The Remarkable Expedition in the UK and The Reluctant Rescue in the US , which was published in 1947 , and subsequently reissued in 1985 . The book received generally good reviews , but remains comparatively unknown . In 1948 , her book of short stories , Growing Up , was published by Heinemann , with the title story a fictionalised account of her affair with Hamish Miles . Manning was to remain with the publisher until 1974 . 
 After living in a series of rented flats , in 1951 the couple moved to a house in St. John 's Wood , where they sublet rooms to lodgers such as the actors Julian Mitchell and Tony Richardson . Fuelled by plenty of gin and tonic to cover her shyness , Manning could be a witty participant in London 's literary scene ; as in childhood she was given to making boastful inventions , such as claiming a family relationship to Marie Belloc Lowndes and that she had received a marriage proposal from Anthony Burgess the morning after his wife 's death . Her insecurities also showed in other ways : she was very anxious about finances , and always alert for ways to make and save money . After the war both she and Reggie were unfaithful . At parties , Reggie would regularly ask other women if they were interested in extramarital encounters , while Manning claimed to have had affairs with both William Gerhardie and Henry Green , and engaged in an unrequited pursuit of her lodger , Tony Richardson . Jerry Slattery , her doctor , became her long @-@ term lover ; her affair came as a shock to Reggie , who felt he must have disappointed his wife . However , after a difficult start , Reggie adjusted and soon became a close friend of Jerry . Manning 's adultery in some ways made it easier for Reggie to justify his own frequent affairs , including his longstanding relationship with Diana Robson , who was to become his second wife . Manning never paid undue attention to his infidelities , usually responding , " you know what Reggie 's like " . The two never contemplated divorce , believing that marriage was a lifelong commitment . 
 Manning 's first post @-@ war novel , Artist Among the Missing , an evocative account of life in the Middle East , was published in 1949 , and received mixed reviews . She worked on an Irish travel book , The Dreaming Shore , which drew on her Anglo @-@ Irish upbringing , but proved " a millstone " as it required multiple expensive journeys to Ireland . The book was notable for her view that Ireland would one day be united . Manning continued the series of publications with A School for Love , published in 1951 . The novel concerned a boy growing up in Palestine during the Second World War . With its publication , Reggie , on whom Manning relied heavily for literary judgment , help and support , boasted that " My Olivia is what might be called an established author " . The novel was generally well @-@ received , but faced the possibility of a libel suit from Clarissa Graves , sister of Robert on whom Miss Bohun , one of the novel 's characters , may have been based . 
 Manning supplemented her book writing by reviewing for The Spectator , The Sunday Times , The Observer , Punch and others , as well as making occasional contributions to the Palestine Post . Her fourth novel , A Different Face , was published in 1953 . Set in a drab city based on Manning 's hometown of Portsmouth , it chronicled the main character 's attempts to leave his birthplace . The book was not well @-@ reviewed , and as was frequently the case , Manning felt slighted , feeling that she did not get the reviews she deserved . Neurotic self @-@ doubt and perfectionism made her difficult and easily offended , and she was very aware of younger writers outstripping her . Such an author was Iris Murdoch , with whom Manning shared an interest in flying saucers and an uneasy friendship that was tinged with jealousy at the younger Murdoch 's greater success . Manning knew that she was spiteful , but could not help herself , frequently critiquing writer friends to others . However , she consistently praised and admired Ivy Compton @-@ Burnett to whom she had been introduced in 1945 , and whose friendship she greatly valued . She complained about her publisher Heinemann and her lack of recognition from her peers : Anthony Powell called her " the world 's worst <unk> " , and the publisher remembered that she was " never an easy author to handle . " A friend gave her the nickname " Olivia Moaning " , which was picked up by others , much to Manning 's annoyance . 
 In 1955 Manning published The Doves of Venus , which drew on her experiences in London in the 1930s ; the two friends , Ellie Parsons and Nancy Claypole , bore similarities to Manning and Stevie Smith . In the book , an isolated Ellie seeks to escape a stultifying mother . The reviews were generally favourable , but Manning was not satisfied . Perhaps annoyed at her depiction in the novel , Stevie Smith wrote what Manning described as a " bitchy review " ; the two great friends barely spoke thereafter , despite Smith 's efforts at a rapprochement . Eventually , however , Manning grudgingly forgave her : learning of Smith 's final illness , she remarked that " Well , if she 's really ill , we 'll have to let bygones be bygones . " 
 Much time and focus were given to animals , especially the Siamese cats of which Manning was especially fond . She was very concerned about the health and comfort of her pets , taking them on visits to friends , along with hot water bottles for them in case the temperature dropped . She frequently sacked vets – telling one " I do not pay you to tell me that there is nothing wrong with my animal " – and trying animal faith healers at times . Additionally , she was a committed supporter of organisations combating animal cruelty . Her love and interest in cats was illustrated in her book Extraordinary Cats , published in 1967 . 
 In December 1956 , Manning published My Husband Cartwright , a series of twelve sketches about Reggie that had originally appeared in Punch . It was not widely reviewed , and as usual Manning was frustrated and annoyed . The book was to be a precursor of her portrait of her husband in Fortunes of War , detailing comic episodes that highlighted Reggie 's character , including his gregarious nature and interest in social issues : " My husband Cartwright is a lover of his fellow @-@ men . Lovers of their fellow @-@ men can be maddening ... While lecturing abroad he suddenly conceived a resentment of ' sights ' especially ' useless ' sights , such as ruins or tombs . You might suppose that were it not for such distractions as Tiberias , the Valley of the Kings or Hadrian 's Villa , tourists abroad would occupy themselves solely in alleviating poverty . " 
 = = The Balkan Trilogy and other works = = 
 Between 1956 and 1964 Manning 's main project was The Balkan Trilogy , a sequence of three novels based on her experiences during the Second World War ; as usual she was supported and encouraged by Reggie . The books describe the marriage of Harriet and Guy Pringle as they live and work in Romania and Greece , ending with their escape to Alexandria in 1941 just ahead of the Germans . Guy , a man at once admirable and unsatisfactory , and Harriet , a woman alternately proud and impatient , move from early passion to acceptance of difference . Manning described the books as long chapters of an autobiography , and early versions were written in the first person . There was significant fictionalisation , however . While Manning had been 31 and Reggie 25 at the outset of war , Manning 's alter ego Harriet Pringle was a mere 21 , and her husband a year older . Manning was a writer by profession , while her creation was not . 
 The first book in the trilogy , The Great Fortune , received mixed reviews , but subsequent volumes , The Spoilt City and Friends and Heroes were generally well @-@ received ; Anthony Burgess announced that Manning was " among the most accomplished of our women novelists " and comparisons were made to Lawrence Durrell , Graham Greene , Evelyn Waugh and Anthony Powell . There were a few carping voices , and as usual , they ignited Manning 's ire . 
 Following the publication of the final volume of The Balkan Trilogy in 1965 , Manning worked on her cat memoir and a collection of short stories , A Romantic Hero and Other Stories , both of which were published in 1967 . Another novel , The Play Room ( published as The <unk> Girls in the US ) , appeared in 1969 . The book of short stories and The Play Room both contained homosexual themes , a topic which interested Manning . The latter was a less than successful exploration of the lives and interests of adolescents , though the reviews were generally encouraging . A film version was proposed , and Ken Annakin asked her to write the script . The movie , with more explicit lesbian scenes than the book , was all but made before the money ran out ; a second version , with a very different script , was also developed but came to nothing . " Everything fizzled out " , she said . " I wasted a lot of time and that is something which you cannot afford to do when you are sixty " ; in keeping with her <unk> about her age , she was actually sixty @-@ two . 
 = = The Levant Trilogy = = 
 The 1970s brought a number of changes to the household : the couple moved to a smaller apartment following Reggie 's early retirement from the BBC and 1972 appointment as a lecturer at the New University of Ulster in Coleraine . The couple subsequently lived apart for long periods , as Manning rejected the idea of moving to Ireland . 
 Manning was always a close observer of life , and gifted with a photographic memory . She told her friend Kay Dick that " I write out of experience , I have no fantasy . I don 't think anything I 've experienced has ever been wasted . However , her 1974 novel The Rain Forest showed off her creative skills in her portrayal of a fictional island in the Indian Ocean and its inhabitants . Set in 1953 , the novel 's central characters are a British couple ; the book examines their personal experiences and tragedies against the background of a violent end to colonial British rule . The book is one of Manning 's lesser @-@ known books , and she was disappointed that it was not shortlisted for the Booker prize . 
 Early in 1975 Manning began The Danger Tree , which for a time she described as " The Fourth Part of the Balkan Trilogy " ; in the event , it became the first novel in The Levant Trilogy , continuing the story of the Pringles in the Middle East . The first book proved " a long struggle " to write , in part because of Manning 's lack of confidence in her powers of invention : the book juxtaposes the Desert War experiences of a young officer , Simon Boulderstone , with the <unk> lives of the Pringles and their circle . Manning , fascinated by sibling relationships , and remembering the death of her own brother , also examined the relationship between Simon and his elder brother , Hugo . She felt inadequate in her ability to write about soldiers and military scenes ; initial reviewers agreed , finding her writing unconvincing and improbable , though subsequent reviewers have been considerably kinder . 
 While some parts of the book were inventions , she also made use of real @-@ life incidents . The opening chapter of The Danger Tree describes the accidental death of the young son of Sir Desmond and Lady Hooper . The incident was based on fact : Sir Walter and Lady Amy Smart 's eight @-@ year @-@ old boy was killed when he picked up a stick bomb while on a desert picnic in January 1943 . Just as described in the novel , his grief @-@ stricken parents had tried to feed the dead boy through a hole in his cheek . Manning had long been resentful at the <unk> ' failure to include her and Reggie in their artistic circle in Cairo . However , the scene was considered in poor taste even by Manning 's friends , who were also outraged that the quiet and faithful Lady Smart was associated with Manning 's very different Lady Hooper . Though both Sir Walter and his wife had died by the time of publication , Manning 's publisher received a solicitor 's letter written on behalf of the Smart family , objecting to the scene and requiring that there should be no further reference to the incident or to the couple in future volumes . Manning ignored both requests . She based the character of Aidan Pratt on the actor , writer and poet Stephen Haggard , whom she had known in Jerusalem . Like Pratt , Haggard committed suicide on a train from Cairo to Palestine , but in Haggard 's case it followed the end of a relationship with a beautiful Egyptian woman , rather than unrequited homosexual love . After years of complaints about her publisher Heinemann , Manning moved to Weidenfeld & Nicolson , and remained with them until the end of her life . The Danger Tree was a considerable critical success , and though Manning was disappointed yet again that her novel was not shortlisted for the Booker prize , the Yorkshire Post selected it as their Best Novel of 1977 . This award followed her 1976 appointment to the Order of the British Empire . 
 With Field Marshal Montgomery 's Memoirs as her guide , Manning found battle scenes easier to write in the second volume of the trilogy , The Battle Lost and Won . After a slow start , Manning wrote with certainty and speed ; the book was completed in a record seven months , and published in 1978 . The book follows the Pringles as Rommel and the Afrika Korps approach Alexandria , where Guy is teaching . Egypt remains a place of privilege and sexual exchange for the non @-@ combatants and the Pringles ' marriage slowly disintegrates . 
 = = Final years = = 
 Manning was deeply affected by the sudden death in 1977 of Jerry Slattery , her lover and confidant for more than a quarter of a century . Manning 's last years were also made difficult by physical deterioration ; arthritis increasingly affected her , leading to hip replacements in 1976 and in 1979 and she suffered poor health related to amoebic dysentery caught in the Middle East . Manning began work on the final novel in The Levant Trilogy , The Sum of Things , in which Harriet agrees to sail home to the UK , but having said goodbye to Guy , changes her mind . The novel describes Harriet 's travels in Syria , Lebanon and Palestine , observes Guy 's supposed <unk> in Cairo after he hears of the sinking of Harriet 's ship , and follows Simon Boulderstone 's injury during the battle of El Alamein and recovery . 
 The Sum of Things was published posthumously , for on 4 July 1980 Manning suffered a severe stroke while visiting friends in the Isle of Wight . She died in hospital on 23 July ; somewhat typically , Reggie , having been recalled from Ireland , was not present when she died . He could not bear to see her " fade away " and had gone to London to keep himself busy . Manning had long predicted that the frequently tardy Reggie would be late for her funeral , and he almost was . In addition , his mourning period , characterised by abrupt transitions from weeping to almost hysterical mirth , was precisely how Manning had imagined Guy Pringle 's reaction to Harriet 's supposed death in The Sum of Things . Manning was cremated and her ashes buried at Billingham Manor on the Isle of Wight . 
 Manning had long complained about the lack of recognition she had received as a writer , and was not consoled when her husband and friends responded that her talent would be recognised , and her works read for years to come . " I want to be really famous now , Now " , she retorted . As it happened , her renown and readership developed substantially after her death ; a television serialisation of Fortunes of War starring Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh finally came to fruition in 1987 , bringing her work to a wider audience . 
 = = Work = = 
 = = = Reception = = = 
 The posthumous popularity of Fortunes of War notwithstanding , most of Manning 's books are rarely read and have received little critical attention . Of her books , only Fortunes of War , School for Love , The Doves of Venus , The Rain Forest and A Romantic Hero remain in print . Some of her novels , most often Fortunes of War , have been translated into French , German , Finnish , Swedish , Danish , Spanish , Greek , Romanian and Hebrew . As in her lifetime , opinions are divided ; some assert that her books are " flawed by self @-@ indulgence and a lack of self @-@ judgment " , and criticise portrayals of ethnic and religious groups as stereotyped and caricatured . Others praise tight , perceptive and convincing narratives and excellent characterisation . Her plots are often described as journeys , odysseys and quests in both literal and metaphorical senses . Manning 's talent for " exquisite evocations of place " , including physical , cultural and historical aspects have been widely admired , and the critic Walter Allen complimented her " painter 's eye for the visible world " . 
 = = = = Fortunes of War = = = = 
 Manning 's best known works , the six books comprising Fortunes of War , have been described as " the most underrated novels of the twentieth century " and the author as " among the greatest practitioners of 20th @-@ century roman @-@ <unk> " . Written during the Cold War more than sixteen years after the period described , The Balkan Trilogy , set in Romania and Greece , is considered one of the most important literary treatments of the region in wartime , while criticised for the Cold War era images of <unk> , and for Manning 's inability to " conceal her antipathy towards all things Romanian . " The Levant Trilogy , set in the Middle East , is praised for its detailed description of Simon Boulderstone 's desert war experience and the juxtaposition of the Pringles and their marriage with important world events . Excerpts from the novels have been reprinted in collections of women 's war writing . Theodore Steinberg argues for the Fortunes of War to be seen as an epic novel , noting its broad scope and the large cast of interesting characters set at a pivotal point of history . As with other epic novels , the books examine intertwined personal and national themes . There are frequent references to the Fall of Troy , including Guy Pringle 's production of Shakespeare 's Troilus and Cressida in which British expatriates play themselves while Romania and Europe mirror the doomed Troy . In Steinberg 's perspective , the books also challenge the typically male genre conventions of the epic novel by viewing the war principally through the eyes of a female character " who frequently contrasts her perceptions with those of the men who surround her " . In contrast , Adam <unk> views the novel sequence as a failed epic , the product of a Cold War desire to repress change as illustrated by " Harriet 's self @-@ <unk> dogged focus on their marriage " without dealing with the radicalism of the war , and fate of its victims as represented by Guy and his political engagement . 
 = = = = Other works = = = = 
 Manning 's other works have largely been described as precursors to the two trilogies . Her pre @-@ war novel , The Wind Changes ( 1937 ) , set in Ireland , anticipates the future works in its " subtle exploration of relationships against a backdrop of war . " Her post @-@ war works , which are alternately set at home and abroad , are considered first , less than successful steps in clarifying her ideas about an expatriate war and how to write about it . Novels and stories set in England and Ireland are permeated by staleness and discontent , while those set abroad highlight the excitement and adventure of her later works . Two books set in Jerusalem , The Artist Among the Missing ( 1949 ) and School for Love ( 1951 ) , her first commercial and critical success , are also first steps in exploring themes such war , colonialism and British imperialism . 
 Manning wrote reviews , radio adaptations and scripts and several non @-@ fiction books . Her book The Remarkable Expedition ( 1947 ) about Emin Pasha and Henry Stanley was generally well reviewed , and when reissued in 1985 was praised for its humour , story telling and fairness to both subjects . Her travel book about Ireland , The Dreaming Shore ( 1950 ) , received a mixed review even from her old friend Louis MacNeice , but extracts from this and other of Manning 's Irish writing have subsequently been admired and anthologised . Manning 's book Extraordinary cats ( 1967 ) proved to be chiefly about her own well @-@ loved pets , and Stevie Smith 's review in the Sunday Times complained that the book was " more agitated than original . " She also published two collections of short stories , the well @-@ reviewed Growing Up ( 1946 ) and A Romantic Hero and Other Stories ( 1967 ) ; the latter included eight stories from the earlier volume , and is imbued with a sense of mortality . 
 = = = Themes = = = 
 = = = = War = = = = 
 In contrast to other women 's war fiction of the period , Manning 's works do not recount life on the home front . Instead , her Irish and Second World War fiction observe combatants and non @-@ combatants at the front and behind the lines . Wars , in Manning 's view , are battles for place and influence , and " with her range of images and illusions , Manning reminds us that wars over land have been a constant . " Her books do not celebrate British heroism nor the innocence of civilians , emphasising instead that the causes and dangers of war come as much from within as from without , with the gravest threats coming from fellow Britons . Military men are far from heroic , and official British responses are presented as farcical . In the Fortunes of War , the conflict is viewed largely from the perspective of a civilian woman , an observer , though later books include Simon Boulderstone 's soldier 's view of battle . Views differ on her success in the Fortunes of War <unk> ; initial reviews by Auberon Waugh and Hugh Massie criticised them as implausible and not fully realised , but later commentators have describing her depiction of battle as vivid , poignant and largely convincing . Her books serve as an indictment of war and its horrors ; William Gerhardie noted in 1954 of Artist among the Missing that " it is war seen in a compass so narrowed down that the lens scorches and all but ignites the paper . " There is a strong focus of the impermanence of life ; death and mortality are a constant presence and preoccupation for civilian and soldier alike , and repetition – of stories , events and deaths – used to give " the impression of lives trapped in an endless war " for which there is no end in sight . 
 = = = = Colonialism and imperialism = = = = 
 A major theme of Manning 's works is the British empire in decline . Her fiction contrasts deterministic , imperialistic views of history with one that accepts the possibility of change for those displaced by colonialism . Manning 's works take a strong stance against British imperialism , and are harshly critical of racism , anti @-@ Semitism and oppression at the end of the British colonial era . " British imperialism is shown to be a corrupt and self @-@ serving system , which not only deserves to be dismantled but which is actually on the verge of being dismantled " , writes Steinberg . The British characters in Manning 's novels almost all assume the legitimacy of British superiority and imperialism and struggle with their position as oppressors who are unwelcome in countries they have been brought up to believe welcome their colonising influence . In this view , Harriet 's character , marginalised as an exile and a woman , is both oppressor and oppressed , while characters such as Guy , Prince <unk> and Sophie seek to exert various forms of power and authority over others , reflecting in microcosm the national conflicts and imperialism of the British Empire . Phyllis <unk> , who has written extensively on Manning 's writing from a colonial and post @-@ colonial perspective , notes how even sympathetic characters are not excused their complicity as colonisers ; the responses of the Pringles assert " the vexed relationship between their own status as colonial exiles and that of the colonised " and native Egyptians , though given very little direct voice in The Levant Trilogy , nevertheless assert subjectivity for their country . 
 In The Artist Among the Missing ( 1949 ) , Manning illustrates the racial tensions that are created when imperialism and multiculturalism mix , and , as in her other war novels , evaluates the political bind in which the British seek to defeat racist Nazism while upholding British colonial exploitation . The School for Love ( 1951 ) is the tale of an orphaned boy 's journey of disillusionment in a city that is home to Arabs , Jews and a repressive , colonial presence represented in the novel by the cold , self @-@ righteous , and anti @-@ Semitic character of Miss Bohun . 
 Manning explores these themes not only in her major novels set in Europe and the Middle East , but also in her Irish fiction , The Wind Changes ( 1937 ) and eight short stories which were mostly written early in her career . In these works , colonialist attitudes are reproduced by Manning 's stereotyping of Catholic southerners as wild , primitive and undisciplined , while northerners live lives of well @-@ ordered efficiency . Displaced principal characters struggle to find their place in social groups whose values they no longer accept . Manning has also been noted for her direct and early focus on the impact of the end of colonial rule . The Rain Forest ( 1974 ) presents a later , highly pessimistic view , satirising British expatriate values on a fictional island . It also critiques those involved in the independence movement , expressing a disillusioned view of the island 's future post @-@ independence prospects . 
 = = = = Displacement and " Otherness " = = = = 
 Displacement and alienation are regular themes in Manning 's books . Characters are often isolated , physically and emotionally removed from family and familiar contexts and seeking a place to belong . This crisis of identity may reflect that of Manning herself as the daughter of an Irish mother and a British naval officer . " I 'm really confused about what I am , never really feeling that I belong in either place " , she told an interviewer in 1969 . In Manning 's war fiction , conflict creates additional anxiety , emotional displacement and distance , with characters unable to communicate with each other . Eve Patten notes the " pervasive sense of liminality " and the recurrent figure of the refugee in Manning 's work . Early literary interest in displacement was reinforced by Manning 's own terrifying and disorientating experiences as a refugee during the war . Her travels also brought her into direct contact with the far worse plight of other war refugees , including Jewish asylum @-@ seekers who were leaving Romania aboard the Struma . Exile had its rewards for literary refugees such as Manning , offering exposure to different cultures and " the sense of a greater , past civilisation " , as she described in her 1944 review of British poetry . Her writing , however , reflects her deep concern for the realities of most refugees , who are portrayed as " a degraded and demoralised Other " , challenging complacent Western notions of stability and nationality . 
 Manning has been classified as an Orientalist writer , whose depictions of cultures frequently emphasise exoticism and alien landscape . This feature has been most closely examined in her novels set in Romania . In these , scholars note Manning 's positioning of Romania as an exotic " Other " , a legacy of the Ottoman Empire located at the limits of civilised Europe and on the frontier with the uncivilised Orient . Her negative perceptions of Romanian " Otherness " include a childlike population living decadent lives , passive and immoral women , corruption , and a wild , untamed environment . These are contrasted with more positive reactions to Greece and Western Europe as the centre of civilising and orderly life in other books . In keeping with colonial construction of exoticism in Western literature , however , " otherness " is increasingly domesticated as characters recognise , with greater exposure to the country , links to Western culture . Her depiction of Romania led to Fortunes of War being restricted as seditious writing under Romania 's Communist government . 
 = = = = Gender and feminism = = = = 
 Manning 's books are not easily classified as a part of the feminist canon . While Manning supported the rights of women , particularly equal literary fees , she had no sympathy for the Women 's Movement , writing that " [ t ] hey make such an exhibition of themselves . None can be said to be beauties . Most have faces like porridge . " In Manning 's books , the word " feminine " is used in a derogatory sense , and tends to be associated with female complacency , foolishness , artifice and deviousness , and fulfilment for women comes in fairly conventional roles of wife , mother and the private domain . Elizabeth Bowen remarked that Manning had " an almost masculine outfit in the way of experience " that influenced her writing about women and the war . Manning viewed herself not as a female writer , but as a writer who happened to be a woman , and early in her career she obscured her gender using a pseudonym and initials . Manning found it easier to create male characters , and in general her novels tend to minimise differences in gender , writing about people rather than women in particular . Harriet Pringle , for example , moves through processes of self @-@ discovery and empowerment as an individual rather than in feminist solidarity with her sex . In Manning 's The Doves of Venus ( 1960 ) , based on Manning 's friendship with Stevie Smith , female characters display " the 1950s anger more often associated ... with young men . " Treglown comments on how Manning 's early books generally took a forthright approach to sex , often initiated by female characters . Her approach became more nuanced in later volumes , with a subtler depiction of sex , sensuality and sexual frustration in Fortunes of War . The Jungian critic Richard Sugg interpreted Manning 's female characters as punishing themselves for breaching society 's gender norms , including for having erotic feelings . In contrast , Treglown hypothesised that it reflected Manning 's ongoing grieving for her stillborn child .

 = Trevor Hoffman = 
 Trevor William Hoffman ( born October 13 , 1967 ) is an American former baseball relief pitcher who played 18 years in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) from 1993 to 2010 . A long @-@ time closer , Hoffman pitched for the Florida Marlins , San Diego Padres , and the Milwaukee Brewers , including more than 15 years for the Padres . He was the major leagues ' first player to reach the 500- and 600 @-@ save milestones , and was the all @-@ time saves leader from 2006 until 2011 . He currently serves as senior advisor for baseball operations for the Padres . 
 Hoffman played shortstop collegiately at the University of Arizona and was drafted in the 11th round by the Cincinnati Reds . After not having much success batting , Hoffman was converted to a pitcher , as he was able to throw up to 95 miles per hour ( mph ) . The Marlins acquired him in the 1992 expansion draft , and he pitched in Florida until he was traded to the Padres mid @-@ season in 1993 in a deal that sent star Gary Sheffield to the Marlins . Hoffman recorded 20 saves in 1994 in his first season as Padres closer , and in the following years , he became the face of the franchise after Tony Gwynn retired . He collected at least 30 saves each year for the next 14 years , except for 2003 when he missed most of the year recovering from shoulder surgery . After San Diego did not re @-@ sign him following the 2008 season , Hoffman pitched for two years with the Brewers before retiring after the 2010 season . 
 Hoffman was selected for the All @-@ Star team seven times , and twice he was the runner @-@ up for the National League ( NL ) Cy Young Award , given annually to the top pitcher in the league . He retired with MLB records of fifteen 20 @-@ save seasons , fourteen 30 @-@ save seasons ( including eight consecutive ) , and nine 40 @-@ save seasons ( including two streaks of four consecutive ) . He also retired with the highest career strikeout rate of any reliever . Though he entered the majors with a powerful fastball , an injury after the 1994 season permanently sapped Hoffman 's fastball velocity and forced him to reinvent his pitching style ; he subsequently developed one of the best changeups in baseball . Hoffman 's entrance at home games accompanied by the song " Hells Bells " was popular with fans . He became eligible for consideration for Baseball Hall of Fame induction starting in 2016 . 
 After retiring as a player , Hoffman returned to the Padres as a special assistant in the front office . In 2014 , he became the team 's pitching coordinator at their upper minor league levels , which included working with the Padres general manager . The following year , his role expanded to overseeing pitching instruction at all levels in the minors . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Hoffman was born in Bellflower , California . When he was six weeks old , Hoffman had to have a damaged kidney removed because an arterial blockage had formed there . His father , Ed , who stood at 6 feet 2 inches ( 1 @.@ 88 m ) and 225 pounds ( 102 kg ) , was a Marine and a veteran of the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II . He later became a professional singer before he quit being on the road and got a job at the post office . He was also an usher at California Angels games ; he was known as the Singing Usher , leading the crowd in the singing of " Take Me Out to the Ball Game " in the seventh @-@ inning and filling in if the designated national anthem singer did not show up . Ed would often bring Trevor to the games with him . Hoffman 's mother , Mikki , was a ballerina and came from an athletic family . Her father was a professional soccer player before World War II .

 Hoffman 's older brother , Glenn , was nine years older and played shortstop in the Boston Red Sox organization .

Hoffman responded , " I went 2 @-@ for @-@ 4 , double , RBI . " to which Greg replied , " That 'll be the last ( blanking ) time you tell me how you did . When I ask you how you did , it 's how the team did . " Hoffman never forgot that . Given their age difference , Hoffman considered his brothers more role models than playmates . " [ Glenn ] was the guide while Greg was the drill instructor " , said Hoffman . 
 Because of his damaged kidney , Hoffman was not allowed to play football or wrestle . Hoffman went to Savanna High School as had Glenn , which put pressure on Hoffman following his more talented older brother . Ed , who did not trust that coaches would protect Hoffman 's arm , stopped allowing his son to pitch after he was 12 years old . Standing at just 5 feet 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 68 m ) and 130 pounds ( 59 kg ) , Hoffman played shortstop at Savanna , but nobody offered him a scholarship out of high school . He grew three inches over the summer and continued playing at Cypress College , and later for the University of Arizona from 1988 through 1989 . Arizona was afraid of the liability if Hoffman 's remaining kidney got hit by a baseball . " I told them the one kidney I have is on my right side . That 's not the side that faces the pitcher when I hit , so it was O.K. They bought it " , said Hoffman . He led Arizona in hitting in 1988 with a .371 batting average , 35 points better than teammate J. T. Snow . Other notable teammates included Scott Erickson and Kevin Long .

 In the offseason , Hoffman expressed interest in taking over the closer role for a team near his home in San Diego , but he did not wish to return as a setup pitcher and diminish his accomplishments .

 Hoffman is known for his high leg kick , the menacing glare through his cap pulled down almost to his eyes , and his deceptive changeup . When Hoffman first came into the league , he could throw up to 95 mph . He would also throw a slider and only an occasional changeup . His original changeup was a conventional circle changeup taught to him by Cincinnati scout Larry Barton . Hoffman learned a different changeup , which he throws with a palmball grip , from teammate Donnie Elliott in 1994 . He began using the new changeup in 1995 when his fastball had dropped to 88 – 90 mph after his offseason injury on the beach . With the decrease in velocity , Hoffman knew he could not rely as much on his fastball . He played through 1995 and had surgery the following offseason for a torn rotator cuff . When he returned the following year , Hoffman 's fastball was at 87 – 88 mph , but he had more experience with his new changeup . His fastball reached back as high as 91 mph in 1998 , but by sometime after 2000 it dropped down to 83 – 88 mph . His repertoire by then included primarily of his changeup , a four @-@ seam fastball , a slower cut fastball that moves in towards a left @-@ handed batter , and the occasional slider and a curveball . 
 Hoffman explained the key to his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his thumb and index finger as he released it . He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball , and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter . His changeup ranged from 73 – 76 mph . Bruce Bochy , who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres , said of Hoffman 's changeup : " He pitched so well off his fastball [ opponents ] couldn 't just sit on it every pitch . " " You could be sitting on [ his changeup ] and still not be successful with it " , says former player Mark Sweeney . It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years . With opponents flailing to slow down their swings , teammates nicknamed Hoffman 's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode . " Some [ pitchers ] fool you . Some guys overpower you . Hoffman embarrasses you " , said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza . After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman , Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said , " It 's like it has a parachute on it . " As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career , he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup . He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret . " I was a little weird about it " , Hoffman said . " I didn 't like talking about how I threw the change . I didn 't want people to see how I gripped the ball . I thought I 'd be giving away something to the hitters . " Later in his career , he posed for pictures of his grip , figuring everyone had seen it . 
 = = = Work ethic = = = 
 Padres general manager Kevin Towers said Hoffman was the first one in and the last one out of the ballpark everyday . Hoffman adhered to a daily conditioning program . When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted to the majors in 2001 , Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon run . " I remember sitting in the bullpen that night , and my legs were still trembling from the run " , Fikac recalled . " I 'd run before , but not at that pace ... I was thinking , I hope they don 't call on me because I can 't feel my legs under me ... His work ethic is unbelievable . " Bochy said , " [ Hoffman 's ] one of those guys like Tony Gwynn — they never feel like they 've arrived . Tony never thought , ' Well , I 'm hitting .360 ... ' He was never content . And Trevor 's the same way . They just keep working and make sure that they 've got goals they want to reach . " After every save opportunity , whether he converted it or blew it , Hoffman would sit in the dugout for up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out . Whether it was the euphoria from success or the sting of failure , he would sit there and drain all the emotion out of himself , put the game behind him , and move on . Tracy Hoffman said , " He 's all about order . That 's the foundation to what he does . You see it when he 's on the field . He 's always the same , win or lose . He doesn 't smile , doesn 't show any emotion . " Padres manager Bud Black marveled at Hoffman 's regimen . " The daily preparation for his job , that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning ... It was incredible to see live " , said Black . " I played with George Brett , a Hall of Famer who was a great worker . But Trevor took it to a level and a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber . " After Hoffman resurrected his final season and recorded his 600th save , Macha said Hoffman 's " work ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there . " 
 = = = Character = = = 
 Hoffman was long regarded as one of the great teammates in baseball . He was known as a leader in the clubhouse and a tutor to younger players . He mentored his successor in San Diego , Heath Bell , and the pitcher who supplanted him in Milwaukee , John Axford . " Just watching him go about his business was a big thing to me " , Bell said . In his first game pitching setup to Axford after losing his closer role , Hoffman stayed in the dugout to watch Axford finish . Many relievers retire back to the clubhouse after being removed from a game . Hoffman 's teammates noticed that he stayed supporting Axford through a bases @-@ loaded jam . Axford spent the season absorbing Hoffman 's advice , and the two bonded . " He took young players under his wing , especially relief pitchers " , said former Padres teammate Brad Ausmus . Hoffman regularly organized team dinners on the road or had team family gatherings at his home , whether it was with the Padres or the Brewers . " It 's very unusual for a pitcher , especially a relief pitcher , to be the team leader " , Padres first baseman Phil Nevin said in 2002 , " but everybody here looks to Trevor . This is his team . " 
 According to Ausmus , Hoffman wanted his teams to feel like a family . He felt like he let his family down if he did not do his job on a particular night . Still , he was accessible and held himself accountable on the rare occasions that he failed . Hoffman was more accommodating for interviews after blown saves than he was after successful ones . " The people asking the questions are not responsible for the ball flying out of the park " , he explained . Both Towers and Black best remember Hoffman for his accountability after his blown save in the 2007 Wild Card tie @-@ breaker . 
 " My greatest memory of Trevor is from game No. 163 in 2007 . Seeing his passion for the Padres , his love for his teammates , and his devastation over the loss and then handling each reporter 's question with the utmost class and professionalism ranks as my greatest sports memory . How he handled that incredible loss says more about him than any save could . Life is about how you handle adversity and what he demonstrated that night was just remarkable . 
 Baseball people revere Hoffman for how he treats people . Ausmus says Hoffman goes out of his way to engage fans . Beyond shaking hands or signing autographs , he has extended conversations with fans who want to talk baseball . When Hoffman passed on the Indians in free agency to stay with the Padres , he still sent an autographed jersey as a baby gift to then @-@ Indians manager Eric Wedge . After Hoffman saved the game to clinch the NL West on the last day of the 1996 season , he called Randy Smith , who traded for Hoffman as Padre GM before moving on to the Detroit Tigers . " Randy , I wish you were here " , Hoffman said . " You 're a part of this . " While celebrating his record setting 479th save against the Pirates , Hoffman tipped his cap to the Pittsburgh dugout , particularly Pirates manager Jim Tracy , who managed Hoffman in Cincinnati 's Double @-@ A Chattanooga farm team in 1991 after he was converted to a pitcher . Despite losing his role as a closer in his final season , Hoffman took pleasure in supporting his teammates and " not being a cancer just because I was having trouble . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Hoffman dominated his position at a consistent level while enjoying incredible longevity over almost two decades . After an 18 @-@ year career , the seven @-@ time NL All @-@ Star retired as MLB 's all @-@ time leader in saves with 601 . He was the first pitcher to reach not only the 500 save milestone , but also 600 . He converted 88 @.@ 8 percent of his save opportunities , the third @-@ highest rate among players with 300 or more saves . Barry Bloom of MLB.com called Hoffman " the best National League closer of his era . " Hoffman is one of only three pitchers who have had streaks of four straight seasons with at least 40 saves ; he achieved it twice . His nine seasons of 40 or more saves are tied for the most all @-@ time . His 15 @-@ year stint as Padres closer was rare for a baseball role that exhibited a high turnover rate . 
 Hoffman had 12 seasons with at least 37 saves , 13 seasons with a sub @-@ 3 @.@ 00 ERA and 14 with an ERA + of at least 130 ( indicating that he was at least 30 percent better than the league average in ERA those years ) . Four times he was in the top six in voting for the Cy Young Award , including twice as a runner @-@ up . Among pitchers to debut since 1969 , he is one of only two ranked in the top 10 for lowest opponents ' batting average against facing both lefties and righties . Hoffman retired ranked first with 856 games finished , ninth with 1 @,@ 035 games pitched , seventh @-@ lowest in hits per nine innings ( H / 9 ) at 6 @.@ 99 , and seventh @-@ best in strikeout @-@ to @-@ walk ratio ( K / BB ) of 3 @.@ 69 . He had a 2 @.@ 87 ERA and 1 @.@ 06 walks plus hits per inning pitched ( WHIP ) for his career . 
 Though he was not a power pitcher , Hoffman was a strikeout pitcher . His 9 @.@ 36 K / 9 was the fifth @-@ highest in MLB history , and highest ever among relievers . Sports journalist Fran <unk> wrote in Fireman : The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball that Hoffman was " a thinking man 's closer , using guile rather than heat . " As the velocity of his fastball decreased , he compensated with a devastating changeup that is as synonymous a pitch with Hoffman as the splitter is with Bruce Sutter or the cutter is with Mariano Rivera . " It 's a tough situation throwing a change @-@ up in the ninth inning , unless you 've got Trevor 's changeup " , closer Billy Wagner said . " There 's not many guys who have a changeup that 's dominating " , All @-@ Star third basemen Scott Rolen said . " But his is dominating . It 's a weapon . That 's not usually a word you use with a changeup . " Robb Nen , a retired closer , was amazed at how Hoffman got better after he lost velocity on his fastball . " I don 't think I could do it , to just lose the ability to throw 95 and still be one of the best . I have tremendous respect for him " , Nen said . Another retired closer , Troy Percival , concurred about the difficulty in transforming from a power pitching style . " It 's not easy to do . Guys who throw 95 , 96 [ mph ] have an ego about being able to do that . [ Hoffman ] just went right into , ' Hey , you know , I throw 87 now . This is what I 've got . ' And he goes out there and gets it done just as well as he ever did . " 
 [ Hoffman is ] unique in the sense that what he does , closing , is usually a power pitcher 's game . His change @-@ up isn 't just great , but dominating . What he does puts things in perspective . It 's pitching , not just throwing , and using whatever stuff you have . He throws a pitch that looks so tempting that you can 't lay off it . ... I feel vulnerable when I throw 93 @-@ 96 mph . He 's throwing 81 and doing it with full confidence . 
 During the time Hoffman held the career record for saves , many still considered Rivera the best closer of all time . Like many other relievers of his era , Hoffman was compared to Rivera and his success in the playoffs . While Hoffman had 601 regular @-@ season saves , he only had four in the playoffs . Jayson Stark of ESPN wrote after Hoffman 's retirement announcement , " Not everybody can have his team deliver him an October save opportunity to protect 47 different times . " His last postseason save was in 2006 , which was also his first postseason save in eight years . Though the Padres were in the playoffs three other times in that span , they never took a single lead . Hoffman , however , did blow a save opportunity in his only World Series appearance and also failed on save tries twice in the final three days of the 2007 season as the Padres vied for the playoffs . John <unk> of The Journal News , who covered the New York Yankees for eight years , believes the Yankees would have been just as successful with Hoffman instead of Rivera . David Wells , who played with both Hoffman and Rivera , said , " [ Rivera ] has the better postseason record because the Yankees go to the postseason more than the Padres do , and he 's had more opportunities there . The way they go about it , they 're the best in the game . Trevor 's the best in the West and [ Mariano ] is the best in the East . " Rivera , however , broke Hoffman 's career save record in 2011 . 
 In 2014 , Major League Baseball introduced the Trevor Hoffman National League Reliever of the Year Award , which is awarded annually to the top reliever in the NL . Hoffman became eligible for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame starting in 2016 . In his debut , he fell short of the 75 percent of votes required for entry , but the 67 @.@ 3 percent he received in his first year was promising for possible induction in the future . No career reliever has reached Cooperstown on the first ballot , and only six relievers have been inducted as of 2016 . Lee Smith , the all @-@ time saves leader for 12 years before he was surpassed by Hoffman , was not inducted in 2016 after 14 years on the ballot . Buster Olney of ESPN says any discussion of Hoffman 's deficiencies in the postseason and All @-@ Star Games are small samples compared to his incredible body of work over 18 years . <unk> wrote that Hoffman and Rivera are " the best of the best of the one @-@ inning closers " . Less than 10 percent of Hoffman 's saves were over one inning . Closers as a whole have been criticized for pitching almost exclusively in the ninth inning with no runners on base , while star relievers previously were called firemen , entering games in the middle of innings with runners on base and capable of pitching multiple innings . Saves arguably became overrated as firemen gave way to closers . However , Joe Strauss of the St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch in 2007 proposed that 500 saves ( let alone 600 ) would be enough for him to validate Hoffman 's induction if Sutter was invited with his 300 career saves . Moreover , Hoffman might have accumulated much more than 601 saves had he played for more successful teams . During his tenure in San Diego , the Padres won at least 90 games only twice and had nine losing seasons , including five with no more than 70 wins . Hall of Fame voter Dan Graziano of the Newark Star @-@ Ledger said , " I don 't think much of the save as a stat , but I 'm looking at a guy who 's been a lockdown closer for more than a decade . Closers are a real and important part of the game , and either he or Rivera has been the best one for the past decade . " Some opponents of Hoffman 's induction , including Jeff <unk> of Yahoo ! Sports and Keith Law of ESPN.com , maintain that his limited innings mitigate his impact compared to starting pitchers who have not been inducted , while Joe Posnanski of NBC Sports and writer Joe Sheehan posit that those starters could have excelled as closers , but Hoffman would not have succeeded as a starter . Hoffman pitched 1 @,@ 089 1 ⁄ 3 innings in his career , which tops only Sutter ( 1 @,@ 042 ) among pitchers already inducted in the Hall of Fame . 
 Hoffman 's entrance into games , accompanied by the playing of " Hells Bells " , became popular among fans after it was introduced in 1998 . Tom Verducci of Sports Illustrated wrote that Hoffman 's " signature moment is one of the most electrically charged in sports : Padres fans rising and roaring , in Pavlovian fashion , upon hearing the first bell toll , the foreboding <unk> like something out of Hitchcock as Hoffman enters slowly , stage right . " Opposing closer Jason Isringhausen said , " ' Hells Bells ' in San Diego is Trevor . It 's like when you go there , you want to [ win ] two out of three so you can hear it once . " The initial introduction of Hoffman 's entrance music was a forerunner in the heavy metal closer theme songs used throughout home stadiums . The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune initially noted , " [ Hoffman 's ] entrance was more suited to the World Wrestling Federation than the national pastime . " By the end of Hoffman 's career , San Jose Mercury News and ESPN.com wrote that the song should be honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame . Other teams contacted the Padres for videos of the " Trevor Time " production . Yankees executives witnessing Hoffman 's entrance in 1998 were inspired to use the song " Enter Sandman " for Rivera 's entrance starting the following season .

 Coinciding with his retirement from playing in 2011 , Hoffman returned to San Diego as a special assistant to Padres team president and COO Tom Garfinkel . " There 's been a turnover of people [ in the Padres front office ] who wanted to reconcile and I 've been cool with it . A couple of years definitely makes a big difference " , said Hoffman . In addition to his front office role , he also served as an instructor during spring training . In 2014 , Hoffman became San Diego 's upper @-@ level pitching coordinator , essentially an additional pitching coach for the Padres at their Double @-@ A and Triple @-@ A levels . His new role also involved assisting San Diego general manager Josh Byrnes . Under General Manager A. J. <unk> in 2015 , Hoffman became senior advisor for baseball operations , overseeing pitching instruction at all levels of the Padres ' minor league system .

 Hoffman met his wife , Tracy , in Buffalo , New York in 1992 where she was a real estate agent and a member of the National Football League 's Buffalo Bills cheerleading squad . He asked her to marry him in 1993 while she was on the field during Super Bowl XXVII , which the Buffalo Bills lost to the Dallas Cowboys , 52 – 17 . Hoffman has three sons : Brody , Quinn , and Wyatt .

 = It 's Alive ! ( Dexter ) = 
 " It 's Alive ! " is the second season premiere and thirteenth overall episode of the American television drama series Dexter , which first aired on September 30 , 2007 on Showtime in the United States . The episode was written by Daniel Cerone and was directed by Tony Goldwyn . In the episode , which takes place five weeks after the first season finale , Sgt. James Doakes ( Erik King ) is following Dexter Morgan ( Michael C. Hall ) at all times , but when he gets his first opportunity Dexter finds himself unable to kill . Meanwhile , his sister Debra ( Jennifer Carpenter ) returns to work after her ex @-@ fiancé Brian tried to kill her , and his girlfriend Rita Bennett ( Julie Benz ) refuses to believe that Dexter sent her ex @-@ husband Paul ( Mark Pellegrino ) to prison in spite of the evidence in front of her . 
 Although Dexter 's first season was adapted from Jeff Lindsay 's novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter , the show 's writers decided not to follow Lindsay 's second novel , Dearly Devoted Dexter , in the second season . Filming of the episode began in May in Los Angeles , California , marking the show 's permanent move from Miami , Florida , where the show takes place . A small crew flew to Miami to film short pieces of Dexter which were integrated into " It 's Alive ! " and other episodes , but the bulk of filming took place in San Pedro and Long Beach . With 1 @.@ 09 million viewers , Dexter became the first Showtime series to attract over a million viewers with a season premiere . The episode received mostly positive reviews . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the five weeks after murdering his brother Brian , the " Ice Truck Killer " , Dexter has been followed by suspicious Sgt. Doakes and thus cannot satisfy his urge to kill . Trying to act " relentlessly normal " , Dexter goes bowling almost nightly with his co @-@ workers . He is finally left alone when Doakes gives up and takes a night off ; Dexter pursues a blind voodoo priest , Jimmy ( Glenn Plummer ) , but finds himself uneasy and ultimately unable to kill the man , and lets him go . At a homicide scene , the victim 's mother ( Anna Maganini ) pleads with Dexter to kill her son 's murderer , gang lord " Little Chino " ( Matthew Willig ) . He sees the woman 's young daughter , Marissa ( Jillian Bruno ) , and is reminded of himself as a boy , having witnessed his mother 's brutal death . He leads Doakes to believe that he is bowling for the night but instead brings Chino to Jimmy 's killing room . Chino wakes up in the middle of Dexter 's procedure and manages to break out of the duct tape and escape . 
 Debra , who is staying at Dexter 's apartment , is exercising incessantly and barely able to sleep as she struggles with memories of Brian , her ex @-@ fiancé , trying to kill her . She returns to work at the police station ; Sgt. María LaGuerta ( Lauren Vélez ) expresses concern about her emotional stability , but Debra is determined to resume a normal lifestyle . When she takes Rita out to a bar , a man recognizes Debra as the fiancée of the Ice Truck Killer . He touches her on the shoulder and she instinctively punches him in the nose , certain that he was trying to grab her . 
 Rita takes her children Astor ( Christina Robinson ) and Cody ( Preston Bailey ) to see Paul ( Mark Pellegrino ) in prison . He insists that he was framed by Dexter — that Dexter dragged him out of Rita 's house before drugging him and tipping off the police — and that if she could find his missing shoe it would prove his innocence . Rita tells him that there is no shoe , despite having found it over a month ago . She later admits that she found the shoe , but refuses to acknowledge that Dexter is involved . That night , she receives a call from Paul 's prison and learns that he was killed in an inmate altercation . 
 Flashbacks throughout the episode show the attempts of a teenage Dexter ( Devon Graye ) to feel his heart pound . At the end of the episode , Debra turns on the television in Dexter 's apartment and shows him the news : a team of scuba divers in Biscayne Bay has uncovered over 30 garbage bags , each containing parts of Dexter 's mutilated victims . As he watches , his heart races . 
 = = Production = = 
 The first season of Dexter followed the same storyline of Jeff Lindsay 's novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter , the first in the series of novels on which the television show is based , albeit with many additional elements and altered characters . When writing the second season , Daniel Cerone said that the writers " didn 't see the opportunity in the second book " to continue on the path that they hoped to go down and chose to depart from Lindsay 's second Dexter novel , Dearly Devoted Dexter . Instead , they chose " to turn our biggest card up - " What if Dexter 's bodies were discovered ? " - and just chart that course throughout the season . " According to executive producer Clyde Phillips , they decided to resume the second season storyline five weeks after season one 's finale " so all of the emotional resonance of what each [ character ] went through [ ... ] will continue as if that were the actual passage of time , so they 're still dented and rocked by what has happened . " Cerone added that " The nice thing with Dexter is it 's actually the lack of emotional resonance . " Speaking about Dexter 's situation at the beginning of the second season , Hall said , " I think his world is pretty rocked . He encountered [ his brother ] , a person he never anticipated encountering , someone who sees him for who he is , accepts him as such , and he really has no choice but to do him in ... he 's still reeling from that , and any footing he 's able to establish for himself is pretty much immediately pulled out from under him . " 
 With filming beginning on May 21 , 2007 , " It 's Alive ! " marked the permanent relocation of production from Miami to Los Angeles . Five episodes of the first season were shot on location in Miami , which Cerone said was " a bigger hassle than it was worth " . Showtime programming chief Robert Greenblatt said that " It just became impossible , production @-@ wise , to shoot the whole show [ in Miami ] " , because of the overlap between Dexter 's production window and Florida 's hurricane season , making property insurance costly . A small crew flew to Miami with Hall and filmed , according to producer Sara Colleton , " a lot of pieces — not just Dexter walking in and out of his door or car , but also scenes that we know we 'll need and can use " , which the writers then worked into the episode and others . For the episode , Biscayne Bay was substituted with a set in Los Angeles , while most on location scenes were filmed in and around San Pedro and Long Beach , California .

 " It 's Alive !

However , the eventual recipient of the award was Sidney Wolinsky , for The Sopranos . 
 The episode was positively received . Writing for Variety , Brian Lowry called the second season 's opening " a bloody winner " and said that Hall 's performance " remains a towering achievement " . IGN 's Eric Goldman thought that the episode 's biggest problem was " having to follow up such a great first season " , but called " It 's Alive ! " " a solid episode " . He praised Dexter 's flashbacks and Dexter and Debra 's storylines , though he said that Doakes ' following Dexter was " ridiculous " and that LaGuerta 's overhearing Lt. <unk> Pascal 's private conversation was " a bit contrived " . Keith McDuffee of TV Squad " love [ d ] the flashbacks to a young Dexter and living Harry " . Regarding the episode 's end , he wrote that " just as Dexter 's heart beats out of his chest , as does ours . " Paula Paige , writing for TV Guide , said that the episode " made for some exciting , heart @-@ pounding fear " and called the discovery of Dexter 's corpses " a fantastic storyline " . She commended Benz for " develop [ ing ] her character , Rita , into a person instead of just the shell of one she appeared to be " . Blogcritics ' Ray Ellis commented , " If [ ' It 's Alive ! ' ] is any indication , Dexter 's second season looks to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters . It certainly sets up a number of plot complexities [ ... ] and new devices that offer a myriad of new developments . " The A.V. Club critic Scott Tobias stated that " the writers have done a solid job setting the table for season two " . 
 = 1876 FA Cup Final = 
 The 1876 FA Cup Final was a football match between Wanderers and Old Etonians on 11 March 1876 at Kennington Oval in London . It was the fifth final of the world 's oldest football competition , the Football Association Challenge Cup ( known in the modern era as the FA Cup ) . Wanderers had won the Cup on two previous occasions . The Etonians were playing in their second consecutive final , having lost in the 1875 final . Both teams had conceded only one goal in the four rounds prior to the final . In the semi @-@ finals Wanderers defeated Swifts and the Etonians beat the 1874 FA Cup winners Oxford University . 
 The match finished in a 1 – 1 draw , the second time an FA Cup Final had finished all @-@ square . John Hawley Edwards scored for Wanderers , but the Etonians equalised with a goal credited in modern publications to Alexander Bonsor , although contemporary newspaper reports do not identify him as the scorer . A week later , the replay took place at the same venue . The Etonians were forced to make a number of changes due to players being unavailable , and the revised team was no match for the Wanderers , who won 3 – 0 . Charles Wollaston and Thomas Hughes scored a goal apiece in a five @-@ minute spell before half @-@ time , and Hughes added the third early in the second half . 
 = = Route to the final = = 
 Old Etonians , the team for former pupils of Eton College , had reached the 1875 final but been defeated by Royal Engineers . Wanderers had won the competition in both 1872 and 1873 but had not progressed beyond the quarter @-@ finals in the subsequent two seasons . Both teams entered the 1875 – 76 competition at the first round stage and were allocated matches at home . Wanderers defeated a team from the 1st Surrey Rifles regiment 5 – 0 , and the Etonians overcame Pilgrims 4 – 1 . In the second round Wanderers defeated Crystal Palace ( not the modern club ) 3 – 0 and the Etonians had an easy win over Maidenhead , scoring eight goals without reply . 
 At the quarter @-@ final stage , Wanderers took on the world 's oldest football club , Sheffield and won 2 – 0 , and the Etonians gained a 1 – 0 victory over Clapham Rovers . Both semi @-@ final matches took place at Kennington Oval in London , as stipulated in the original rules of the competition . The Etonians beat the 1874 FA Cup winners Oxford University 1 – 0 in the first semi @-@ final , and a week later Wanderers clinched their place in the final , defeating the Slough @-@ based club Swifts 2 – 1 .

 Three sets of brothers played in the match . Francis and Hubert Heron lined up for the Wanderers , while the Etonians ' team included Hon. Edward Lyttelton and his brother Hon. Alfred Lyttelton and Albert Meysey @-@ Thompson and his brother Charles . The latter pair 's surname had been simply Thompson until it was changed in 1874 , and for the final Albert played under the name Thompson and Charles under the name Meysey . This is the only occasion that two or more pairs of brothers have played in the same FA Cup Final . Later that year , Francis Birley married Margaret , sister of his team @-@ mate Jarvis Kenrick . The Etonian team also included Julian Sturgis , who had been born in the USA and was the first foreign @-@ born player to appear in the Cup Final ( discounting those born to British parents in the British Empire ) , as well as Arthur Kinnaird , who had captained Wanderers to victory in the 1873 FA Cup Final . Wanderers began the match with two full @-@ backs , two half @-@ backs and six forwards , while the Etonians opted for one full @-@ back , two half @-@ backs and seven forwards . 
 Wanderers won the coin toss and chose to start the game defending the Harleyford Road end of The Oval . The crowd was estimated at 3 @,@ 500 , the largest for an FA Cup Final up to that point . The match was played in a strong wind , to the extent that when Frederick Maddison took a corner kick for Wanderers , the gale blew the ball back out of play . The Wanderers dominated the early stages of the game , but the Etonians kept them at bay for around 35 minutes until Charles Wollaston eluded Thompson and passed the ball to John Hawley Edwards , who kicked it narrowly under the crossbar of the Etonians ' goal to give Wanderers the lead . In the second half the Old Etonians had the wind in their favour and had the better of the play . Around five minutes after the interval , a corner kick to the Etonians led to a " scrimmage " ( a term in common use at the time to describe a group of players struggling to gain possession of the ball ) in front of their opponents ' goal , which resulted in the ball and a number of players being forced over the goal @-@ line , uprooting the goalposts in the process . Modern sources credit the goal to Alexander Bonsor , but contemporary newspaper reports in The Sporting Life and Bell 's Life in London do not mention his name , merely noting that the goal was scored " from a scrimmage " . Neither team could manage to score another goal , and the game finished with the scores level , meaning that for the second successive season a replay would be needed to determine the winners of the competition .

 The replay took place one week later at the same venue . The Wanderers fielded an unchanged team , but the Etonians had to make a number of changes , as Meysey was injured and three other players were unavailable due to other commitments . One of the replacements , Edgar Lubbock , had not long recovered from a bout of illness and was noted as being out of practice , and Kinnaird was still suffering the after @-@ effects of an injury sustained in the original match . 
 The weather on the day of the match was extremely cold , with the threat of snow . The Etonians began the match playing in a rough manner , and there were also many appeals from the players for handball , which disrupted play . After around half an hour , the Wanderers ' forwards surged towards their opponents ' goal and Charles Wollaston got the final kick which sent the ball past goalkeeper Quintin Hogg , one of the replacement players brought in for the replay . Almost immediately afterwards , another massed attack by the Wanderers led to Thomas Hughes doubling the lead . 
 Soon after half @-@ time , Hawley Edwards , Francis Heron and Jarvis Kenrick combined in a skilful attack and set up Hughes to score his second goal of the game . Although the Wanderers ' goalkeeper , W. D. O. Greig , was called into action several times , the Etonians were unable to get the ball past him , and the match finished 3 – 0 to the Wanderers . The winning team 's captain Francis Birley was praised for his performance by the press , as were both Lyttleton brothers for the Etonians .

A week after the replay , four of the victorious Wanderers were chosen to represent London in a match against an equivalent team from Sheffield .

 Unlike most sports , college football 's governing body , the NCAA , does not bestow a National Championship title . That title is bestowed by one or more of four different polling agencies . There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason : the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll . Two additional polls are released midway through the season ; the Harris Interactive Poll is released after the fourth week of the season and the Bowl Championship Series ( BCS ) Standings is released after the seventh week . The Harris Poll and Coaches Poll are factors in the BCS Standings .

 = Manuel I Komnenos = 
 Manuel I Komnenos ( or Comnenus ; Greek : <unk> Α ' Κομνηνός , <unk> I Komnēnos ; 28 November 1118 – 24 September 1180 ) was a Byzantine Emperor of the 12th century who reigned over a crucial turning point in the history of Byzantium and the Mediterranean . His reign saw the last flowering of the Komnenian restoration , during which the Byzantine Empire had seen a resurgence of its military and economic power , and had enjoyed a cultural revival . 
 Eager to restore his empire to its past glories as the superpower of the Mediterranean world , Manuel pursued an energetic and ambitious foreign policy . In the process he made alliances with the Pope and the resurgent West . He invaded the Norman Kingdom of Sicily , although unsuccessfully . The passage of the potentially dangerous Second Crusade was adroitly managed through his empire . Manuel established a Byzantine protectorate over the Crusader states of Outremer . Facing Muslim advances in the Holy Land , he made common cause with the Kingdom of Jerusalem and participated in a combined invasion of Fatimid Egypt . Manuel reshaped the political maps of the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean , placing the kingdoms of Hungary and Outremer under Byzantine hegemony and campaigning aggressively against his neighbours both in the west and in the east . 
 However , towards the end of his reign Manuel 's achievements in the east were compromised by a serious defeat at Myriokephalon , which in large part resulted from his arrogance in attacking a well @-@ defended Seljuk position . Although the Byzantines recovered and Manuel concluded an advantageous peace with Sultan Kilij Arslan II , Myriokephalon proved to be the final , unsuccessful effort by the empire to recover the interior of Anatolia from the Turks . 
 Called ho Megas ( ὁ Μέγας , translated as " the Great " ) by the Greeks , Manuel is known to have inspired intense loyalty in those who served him . He also appears as the hero of a history written by his secretary , John Kinnamos , in which every virtue is attributed to him . Manuel , who was influenced by his contact with western Crusaders , enjoyed the reputation of " the most blessed emperor of Constantinople " in parts of the Latin world as well . Modern historians , however , have been less enthusiastic about him . Some of them assert that the great power he wielded was not his own personal achievement , but that of the dynasty he represented ; they also argue that , since Byzantine imperial power declined catastrophically after Manuel 's death , it is only natural to look for the causes of this decline in his reign . 
 = = Accession to the throne = = 
 Manuel Komnenos was the fourth son of John II Komnenos and Piroska of Hungary , so it seemed very unlikely that he would succeed his father . His maternal grandfather was St. Ladislaus . Having distinguished himself in his father 's war against the Seljuk Turks , in 1143 Manuel was chosen as his successor by John , in preference to his elder surviving brother Isaac . After John died on 8 April 1143 , his son , Manuel , was acclaimed emperor by the armies . Yet his succession was by no means assured : At his father 's deathbed in the wilds of Cilicia far from Constantinople , he recognised that it was vital he should return to the capital as soon as possible . He still had to take care of his father 's funeral , and tradition demanded he organise the foundation of a monastery on the spot where his father died . Swiftly , he dispatched the megas domestikos John Axouch ahead of him , with orders to arrest his most dangerous potential rival , his brother Isaac , who was living in the Great Palace with instant access to the imperial treasure and regalia . Axouch arrived in the capital even before news of the emperor 's death had reached it . He quickly secured the loyalty of the city , and when Manuel entered the capital in August 1143 , he was crowned by the new Patriarch , Michael Kourkouas . A few days later , with nothing more to fear as his position as emperor was now secure , Manuel ordered the release of Isaac . Then he ordered 2 golden pieces to be given to every householder in Constantinople and 200 pounds of gold ( including 200 silver pieces annually ) to be given to the Byzantine Church . 
 The empire that Manuel inherited from his father had undergone great changes since its foundation by Constantine , eight centuries before . In the time of his predecessor Justinian I ( 527 – 565 ) , parts of the former Western Roman Empire had been recovered including Italy , Africa and part of Spain . However , the empire had diminished greatly following this , the most obvious change had occurred in the 7th century : the soldiers of Islam had taken Egypt , Palestine and much of Syria away from the empire irrevocably . They had then swept on westwards into what in the time of Constantine had been the western provinces of the Roman Empire , in North Africa and Spain . In the centuries since , the emperors had ruled over a realm that largely consisted of Asia Minor in the east , and the Balkans in the west . In the late 11th century the Byzantine Empire entered a period of marked military and political decline , which had been arrested and largely reversed by the leadership of Manuel 's grandfather and father . Yet the empire that Manuel inherited was a polity facing formidable challenges . At the end of the 11th century , the Normans of Sicily had removed Italy from the control of the Byzantine Emperor . The Seljuk Turks had done the same with central Anatolia . And in the Levant , a new force had appeared – the Crusader states – who presented the Byzantine Empire with new challenges . Now , more than at any time during the preceding centuries , the task facing the emperor was daunting indeed . 
 = = Second Crusade and Raynald of Châtillon = = 
 = = = Prince of Antioch = = = 
 The first test of Manuel 's reign came in 1144 , when he was faced with a demand by Raymond , Prince of Antioch for the cession of Cilician territories . However , later that year the crusader County of Edessa was engulfed by the tide of a resurgent Islamic jihad under Imad ad @-@ Din Atabeg Zengi . Raymond realized that immediate help from the west was out of the question . With his eastern flank now dangerously exposed to this new threat , there seemed little option but for him to prepare for a humiliating visit to Constantinople . Swallowing his pride , he made the journey north to ask for the protection of the Emperor . After submitting to Manuel , he was promised the support that he had requested , and his allegiance to Byzantium was secured . 
 = = = Expedition against Konya = = = 
 In 1146 Manuel assembled his army at the military base Lopadion and set out on a punitive expedition against Masud the Sultan of Rûm , who had been repeatedly violating the frontiers of the Empire in western Anatolia and Cilicia . There was no attempt at a systematic conquest of territory , but Manuel 's army defeated the Turks at <unk> , before capturing and destroying the fortified town of Philomelion , removing its remaining Christian population . The Byzantine forces reached Masud 's capital , Konya , and ravaged the area around the city , but could not assault its walls . Among Manuel 's motives for mounting this <unk> there included a wish to be seen in the West as actively espousing the crusading ideal ; Kinnamos also attributed to Manuel a desire to show off his martial prowess to his new bride . While on this campaign Manuel received a letter from Louis VII of France announcing his intention of leading an army to the relief of the crusader states . 
 = = = Arrival of the Crusaders = = = 
 Manuel was prevented from following up his early successes in the east , for events to the west meant that his presence was urgently required in the Balkans . In 1147 he granted a passage through his dominions to two armies of the Second Crusade under Conrad III of Germany and Louis VII of France . At this time , there were still members of the Byzantine court who remembered the passage of the First Crusade , a defining event in the collective memory of the age that had fascinated Manuel 's aunt , Anna Komnene . 
 Many Byzantines feared the Crusade , a view endorsed by the numerous acts of vandalism and theft practiced by the unruly armies as they marched through Byzantine territory . Byzantine troops followed the Crusaders , attempting to police their behaviour , and further troops were assembled in Constantinople , ready to defend the capital against any acts of aggression . This cautious approach was well advised , but still the numerous incidents of covert and open hostility between the Franks and the Greeks on their line of march , for which it seems both sides were to blame , precipitated conflict between Manuel and his guests . Manuel took the precaution – which his grandfather had not taken – of making repairs to the city walls , and he pressed the two kings for guarantees concerning the security of his territories . Conrad 's army was the first to enter the Byzantine territory in the summer of 1147 , and it figures more prominently in the Byzantine sources , which imply that it was the more troublesome of the two . Indeed , the contemporary Byzantine historian Kinnamos describes a full @-@ scale clash between a Byzantine force and part of Conrad 's army , outside the walls of Constantinople . The Byzantines defeated the Germans and , in Byzantine eyes , this reverse caused Conrad to agree to have his army speedily ferried across to Damalis on the Asian shore of the <unk> . 
 After 1147 , however , the relations between the two leaders became friendlier . By 1148 Manuel had seen the wisdom of securing an alliance with Conrad , whose sister @-@ in @-@ law Bertha of Sulzbach he had earlier married ; he actually persuaded the German king to renew their alliance against Roger II of Sicily . Unfortunately for the Byzantine emperor , Conrad died in 1152 , and despite repeated attempts , Manuel could not reach an agreement with his successor , Frederick I Barbarossa . 
 = = = Cyprus invaded = = = 
 Manuel 's attention was again drawn to Antioch in 1156 , when Raynald of Châtillon , the new Prince of Antioch , claimed that the Byzantine emperor had reneged on his promise to pay him a sum of money and vowed to attack the Byzantine province of Cyprus . Raynald arrested the governor of the island , John Komnenos , who was a nephew of Manuel , and the general Michael <unk> . The Latin historian William of Tyre deplored this act of war against fellow Christians and described the atrocities committed by Raynald 's men in considerable detail . Having ransacked the island and plundered all its wealth , Raynald 's army mutilated the survivors before forcing them to buy back their flocks at exorbitant prices with what little they had left . Thus enriched with enough booty to make Antioch wealthy for years , the invaders boarded their ships and set sail for home . Raynald also sent some of the mutilated hostages to Constantinople as a vivid demonstration of his disobedience and his contempt for the Byzantine emperor . 
 Manuel responded to this outrage in a characteristically energetic way . In the winter of 1158 – 59 , he marched to Cilicia at the head of a huge army ; the speed of his advance ( Manuel had hurried on ahead of the main army with 500 cavalry ) was such that he managed to surprise the Armenian Thoros of Cilicia , who had participated in the attack on Cyprus . Thoros fled into the mountains , and Cilicia swiftly fell to Manuel . 
 = = = Manuel in Antioch = = = 
 Meanwhile , news of the advance of the Byzantine army soon reached Antioch . Realising that he had no hope of defeating Manuel , Raynald also knew that he could not expect any help from king Baldwin III of Jerusalem . Baldwin did not approve of Raynald 's attack on Cyprus , and in any case had already made an agreement with Manuel . Thus isolated and abandoned by his allies , Raynald decided that abject submission was his only hope . He appeared before the Emperor , dressed in a sack with a rope tied around his neck , and begged for forgiveness . Manuel at first ignored the prostrate Raynald , chatting with his courtiers ; William of Tyre commented that this ignominious scene continued for so long that all present were " disgusted " by it . Eventually , Manuel forgave Raynald on condition that he would become a vassal of the Empire , effectively surrendering the independence of Antioch to Byzantium . 
 Peace having been restored , a grand ceremonial procession was staged on 12 April 1159 for the triumphant entry of the Byzantine army into the city , with Manuel riding through the streets on horseback , while the Prince of Antioch and the King of Jerusalem followed on foot . Manuel dispensed justice to the citizens and presided over games and tournaments for the crowd . In May , at the head of a united Christian army , he started on the road to Edessa , but he abandoned the campaign when he secured the release by Nur ad @-@ Din , the ruler of Syria , of 6 @,@ 000 Christian prisoners captured in various battles since the second Crusade . Despite the glorious end of the expedition , modern scholars argue that Manuel ultimately achieved much less than he had desired in terms of imperial restoration . 
 Satisfied with his efforts thus far , Manuel headed back to Constantinople . On their way back , his troops were surprised in line of march by the Turks . Despite this , they won a complete victory , routing the enemy army from the field and inflicting heavy losses . In the following year , Manuel drove the Turks out of Isauria .

 = = = Roger II of Sicily = = = 
 In 1147 Manuel was faced with war by Roger II of Sicily , whose fleet had captured the Byzantine island of Corfu and plundered Thebes and Corinth . However , despite being distracted by a Cuman attack in the Balkans , in 1148 Manuel enlisted the alliance of Conrad III of Germany , and the help of the Venetians , who quickly defeated Roger with their powerful fleet . In 1149 , Manuel recovered Corfu and prepared to take the offensive against the Normans , while Roger II sent George of Antioch with a fleet of 40 ships to pillage Constantinople 's suburbs . Manuel had already agreed with Conrad on a joint invasion and partition of southern Italy and Sicily . The renewal of the German alliance remained the principal orientation of Manuel 's foreign policy for the rest of his reign , despite the gradual divergence of interests between the two empires after Conrad 's death . 
 Roger died in February 1154 and was succeeded by William I , who faced widespread rebellions against his rule in Sicily and Apulia , leading to the presence of Apulian refugees at the Byzantine court . Conrad 's successor , Frederick Barbarossa , launched a campaign against the Normans , but his expedition stalled . These developments encouraged Manuel to take advantage of the multiple instabilities on the Italian peninsula . He sent Michael Palaiologos and John Doukas Kamateros , both of whom held the high imperial rank of sebastos , with Byzantine troops , ten ships , and large quantities of gold to invade Apulia in 1155 . The two generals were instructed to enlist the support of Frederick , but he declined because his demoralised army longed to get back north of the Alps as soon as possible . Nevertheless , with the help of disaffected local barons , including Count Robert of Loritello , Manuel 's expedition achieved astonishingly rapid progress as the whole of southern Italy rose up in rebellion against the Sicilian Crown and the untried William I. There followed a string of spectacular successes as numerous strongholds yielded either to force or the lure of gold . 
 = = = Papal @-@ Byzantine alliance = = = 
 The city of Bari , which had been the capital of the Byzantine <unk> of Southern Italy for centuries before the arrival of the Normans , opened its gates to the Emperor 's army , and the overjoyed citizens tore down the Norman citadel . After the fall of Bari , the cities of Trani , Giovinazzo , Andria , Taranto , and Brindisi were also captured . William arrived with his army , including 2 @,@ 000 knights , but was heavily defeated . 
 Encouraged by the success , Manuel dreamed of restoration of the Roman Empire , at cost of union between the Orthodox and the Catholic Church , a prospect which would frequently be offered to the Pope during negotiations and plans for alliance . If there was ever a chance of reuniting the eastern and western churches , and coming to reconciliation with the Pope permanently , this was probably the most favourable moment . The Papacy was never on good terms with the Normans , except when under duress by the threat of direct military action . Having the " civilised " Eastern Roman Empire on its southern border was infinitely preferable to the Papacy than having to constantly deal with the troublesome Normans of Sicily . It was in the interest of Pope Hadrian IV to reach a deal if at all possible , since doing so would greatly increase his own influence over the entire Orthodox Christian population . Manuel offered a large sum of money to the Pope for the provision of troops , with the request that the Pope grant the Byzantine emperor lordship of three maritime cities in return for assistance in expelling William from Sicily . Manuel also promised to pay 5 @,@ 000 pounds of gold to the Pope and the Curia . Negotiations were hurriedly carried out , and an alliance was formed between Manuel and Hadrian . 
 At this point , just as the war seemed decided in his favour , events turned against Manuel . Byzantine commander Michael Palaiologos alienated allies with his attitude , stalling the campaign as Count Robert III of Loritello refused to speak to him . Although the two were reconciled , the campaign had lost some of its momentum : Michael was soon recalled to Constantinople , and his loss was a major blow to the campaign . The turning point was the Battle for Brindisi , where the Sicilians launched a major counterattack by both land and sea . At the approach of the enemy , the mercenaries that had been hired with Manuel 's gold demanded huge increases in their pay . When this was refused , they deserted . Even the local barons started to melt away , and soon John Doukas was left hopelessly outnumbered . The arrival of Alexios Komnenos Bryennios with some ships failed to retrieve the Byzantine position . The naval battle was decided in favour of the Sicilians , while John Doukas and Alexios Bryennios ( along with four Byzantine ships ) were captured . Manuel then sent Alexios Axouch to Ancona to raise another army , but by this time William had already retaken all of the Byzantine conquests in Apulia . The defeat at Brindisi put an end to the restored Byzantine reign in Italy ; in 1158 the Byzantine army left Italy and never returned again . Both Nicetas Choniates and Kinnamos , the major Byzantine historians of this period , agree , however , that the peace terms Axouch secured from William allowed Manuel to extricate himself from the war with dignity , despite a devastating raid by a Sicilian fleet of 164 ships ( carrying 10 @,@ 000 men ) on Euboea and Almira in 1156 . 
 = = = Failure of the Church union = = = 
 During the Italian campaign , and afterwards , during the struggle of the Papal Curia with Frederick , Manuel tried to seduce the Popes with hints of a possible union between the Eastern and Western churches . Although in 1155 Pope Hadrian had expressed his eagerness to prompt the reunion of the churches , hopes for a lasting Papal @-@ Byzantine alliance came up against insuperable problems . Pope Adrian IV and his successors demanded recognition of their religious authority over all Christians everywhere and sought superiority over the Byzantine Emperor ; they were not at all willing to fall into a state of dependence from one emperor to the other . Manuel , on the other hand , wanted an official recognition of his secular authority over both East and West . Such conditions would not be accepted by either side . Even if a pro @-@ western Emperor such as Manuel agreed , the Greek citizens of the empire would have rejected outright any union of this sort , as they did almost three hundred years later when the Orthodox and Catholic churches were briefly united under the Pope . In spite of his friendliness towards the Roman Church and his cordial relations with all the Popes , Manuel was never honoured with the title of Augustus by the Popes . And although he twice sent embassies to Pope Alexander III ( in 1167 and 1169 ) offering to reunite the Greek and Latin churches , the Pope refused , under pretext of the troubles that would follow union . Ultimately , a deal proved elusive , and the two churches have remained divided . 
 The final results of the Italian campaign were limited in terms of the advantages gained by the Empire . The city of Ancona became a Byzantine base in Italy , accepting the Emperor as sovereign . The Normans of Sicily had been damaged and now came to terms with the Empire , ensuring peace for the rest of Manuel 's reign . The Empire 's ability to get involved in Italian affairs had been demonstrated . However , given the enormous quantities of gold which had been lavished on the project , it also demonstrated the limits of what money and diplomacy alone could achieve . The expense of Manuel 's involvement in Italy must have cost the treasury a great deal ( probably more than 2 @,@ 160 @,@ 000 hyperpyra or 30 @,@ 000 pounds of gold ) , and yet it produced only limited solid gains . 
 = = = Byzantine policy in Italy after 1158 = = = 
 After 1158 , under the new conditions , the aims of the Byzantine policy changed . Manuel now decided to oppose the objective of the Hohenstaufen dynasty to directly annex Italy , which Frederick believed should acknowledge his power . When the war between Frederick I Barbarossa and the northern Italian communes started , Manuel actively supported the Lombard League with money subsidies , agents , and , occasionally , troops . The walls of Milan , demolished by the Germans , were restored with the aid of the Byzantine Emperor . Frederick 's defeat at the Battle of Legnano , on 29 May 1176 , seemed rather to improve Manuel 's position in Italy . According to Kinnamos , Cremona , Pavia , and a number of other " Ligurian " cities went over to Manuel ; his relations were also particularly favourable in regard to Genoa and Pisa , but not to Venice . In March 1171 Manuel had suddenly broken with Venice , ordering all 20 @,@ 000 Venetians on imperial territory to be arrested and their property confiscated . Venice , incensed , sent a fleet of 120 ships against Byzantium . Due to an epidemic , and pursued by 150 Byzantine ships , the fleet was forced to return without great success . In all probability , friendly relations between Byzantium and Venice were not restored in Manuel 's lifetime . 
 = = Balkan frontier = = 
 On his northern frontier Manuel expended considerable effort to preserve the conquests made by Basil II over one hundred years earlier and maintained , sometimes tenuously , ever since . Due to distraction from his neighbours on the Balkan frontier , Manuel was kept from his main objective , the subjugation of the Normans of Sicily . Relations had been good with the Serbs and Hungarians since 1129 , so the Serb rebellion came as a shock . The Serbs of Rascia , being so induced by Roger II of Sicily , invaded Byzantine territory in 1149 . 
 Manuel forced the rebellious Serbs , and their leader , Uroš II , to vassalage ( 1150 – 1152 ) . He then made repeated attacks upon the Hungarians with a view to annexing their territory along the Sava . In the wars of 1151 – 1153 and 1163 – 1168 Manuel led his troops into Hungary and a spectacular raid deep into enemy territory yielded substantial war booty . In 1167 , Manuel sent 15 @,@ 000 men under the command of Andronikos Kontostephanos against the Hungarians , scoring a decisive victory at the Battle of Sirmium and enabling the Empire to conclude a very advantageous peace with the Hungarian Kingdom by which Syrmia , Bosnia , and Dalmatia were ceded . By 1168 nearly the whole of the eastern Adriatic coast lay in Manuel 's hands . 
 Efforts were also made towards a diplomatic annexation of Hungary . The Hungarian heir Béla , younger brother of the Hungarian king Stephen III , was sent to Constantinople to be educated in the emperor 's court . Manuel intended the youth to marry his daughter , Maria , and to make him his heir , thus securing the union of Hungary with the Empire . At court Béla assumed the name Alexius and received the title of Despot , which had previously been applied only to the Emperor himself . However , two unforeseen dynastic events drastically altered the situation . In 1169 , Manuel 's young wife gave birth to a son , thus depriving Béla of his status as heir of the Byzantine throne ( although Manuel would not renounce the Croatian lands he had taken from Hungary ) . Then , in 1172 , Stephen died childless , and Béla went home to take his throne . Before leaving Constantinople , he swore a solemn oath to Manuel that he would always " keep in mind the interests of the emperor and of the Romans " . Béla III kept his word : as long as Manuel lived , he made no attempt to retrieve his Croatian inheritance , which he only afterwards reincorporated into Hungary . 
 = = Relations with Russia = = 
 Manuel Komnenos attempted to draw the Russian principalities into his net of diplomacy directed against Hungary , and to a lesser extent Norman Sicily . This polarised the Russian princes into pro- and anti @-@ Byzantine camps . In the late 1140s three princes were competing for primacy in Russia : prince Iziaslav II of Kiev was related to Géza II of Hungary and was hostile to Byzantium ; Prince Yuri Dolgoruki of Suzdal was Manuel 's ally ( <unk> ) , and <unk> of Galicia is described as Manuel 's vassal ( <unk> ) . Galicia was situated on the northern and northeastern borders of Hungary and , therefore , was of great strategic importance in the Byzantine @-@ Hungarian conflicts . Following the deaths of both Iziaslav and <unk> , the situation became reversed ; when Yuri of Suzdal , Manuel 's ally , took over Kiev and Yaroslav , the new ruler of Galicia , adopted a pro @-@ Hungarian stance . 
 In 1164 @-@ 65 Manuel 's cousin Andronikos , the future emperor , escaped from captivity in Byzantium and fled to the court of Yaroslav in Galicia . This situation , holding out the alarming prospect of Andronikos making a bid for Manuel 's throne sponsored by both Galicia and Hungary , spurred the Byzantines into an unprecedented flurry of diplomacy . Manuel pardoned Andronikos and persuaded him to return to Constantinople in 1165 . A mission to Kiev , then ruled by Prince Rostislav , resulted in a favourable treaty and a pledge to supply the Empire with auxiliary troops ; Yaroslav of Galicia was also persuaded to renounce his Hungarian connections and return fully into the imperial fold . As late as 1200 the princes of Galicia were providing invaluable services against the enemies of the Empire , at that time the Cumans . 
 The restoration of relations with Galicia had an immediate benefit for Manuel when , in 1166 , he dispatched two armies to attack the eastern provinces of Hungary in a vast pincer movement . One army crossed the <unk> Plain and entered Hungary through the Transylvanian Alps ( Southern Carpathians ) , while the other army made a wide circuit to Galicia and , with Galician aid , crossed the Carpathian Mountains . Since the Hungarians had most of their forces concentrated on the Sirmium and Belgrade frontier , they were caught off guard by the Byzantine invasion ; this resulted in the Hungarian province of Transylvania being thoroughly ravaged by the Byzantine armies . 
 = = Invasion of Egypt = = 
 = = = Alliance with the Kingdom of Jerusalem = = = 
 Control of Egypt was a decades @-@ old dream of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem , and king Amalric I of Jerusalem needed all the military and financial support he could get for his policy of military intervention in Egypt . Amalric also realised that if he were to pursue his ambitions in Egypt , he might have to leave Antioch to the hegemony of Manuel who had paid 100 @,@ 000 dinars for the release of Bohemond III . In 1165 , he sent envoys to the Byzantine court to negotiate a marriage alliance ( Manuel had already married Amalric 's cousin Maria of Antioch in 1161 ) . After a long interval of two years , Amalric married Manuel 's grandniece Maria Komnene in 1167 , and " swore all that his brother Baldwin had sworn before . " A formal alliance was negotiated in 1168 , whereby the two rulers arranged for a conquest and partition of Egypt , with Manuel taking the coastal area , and Amalric the interior . In the autumn of 1169 Manuel sent a joint expedition with Amalric to Egypt : a Byzantine army and a naval force of 20 large warships , 150 galleys , and 60 transports , under the command of the megas doux Andronikos Kontostephanos , joined forces with Amalric at Ascalon . William of Tyre , who negotiated the alliance , was impressed in particular by the large transport ships that were used to transport the cavalry forces of the army . 
 Although such a long @-@ range attack on a state far from the centre of the Empire may seem extraordinary ( the last time the Empire had attempted anything on this scale was the failed invasion of Sicily over one hundred and twenty years earlier ) , it can be explained in terms of Manuel 's foreign policy , which was to use the Latins to ensure the survival of the Empire . This focus on the bigger picture of the eastern Mediterranean and even further afield thus led Manuel to intervene in Egypt : it was believed that in the context of the wider struggle between the crusader states and the Islamic powers of the east , control of Egypt would be the deciding factor . It had become clear that the ailing Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt held the key to the fate of the crusader states . If Egypt came out of its isolation and joined forces with the Muslims under Nur ad @-@ Din , the crusader cause was in trouble . 
 A successful invasion of Egypt would have several further advantages for the Byzantine Empire . Egypt was a rich province , and in the days of the Roman Empire it had supplied much of the grain for Constantinople before it was lost to the Arabs in the 7th century . The revenues that the Empire could have expected to gain from the conquest of Egypt would have been considerable , even if these would have to be shared with the Crusaders . Furthermore , Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric 's plans , not only to deflect the ambitions of the Latins away from Antioch , but also to create new opportunities for joint military ventures that would keep the King of Jerusalem in his debt , and would also allow the Empire to share in territorial gains . 
 = = = Failure of the expedition = = = 
 The joined forces of Manuel and Amalric laid siege to Damietta on 27 October 1169 , but the siege was unsuccessful due to the failure of the Crusaders and the Byzantines to co @-@ operate fully . According to Byzantine forces , Amalric , not wanting to share the profits of victory , dragged out the operation until the emperor 's men ran short of provisions and were particularly affected by famine ; Amalric then launched an assault , which he promptly aborted by negotiating a truce with the defenders . On the other hand , William of Tyre remarked that the Greeks were not entirely blameless . Whatever the truth of the allegations of both sides , when the rains came , both the Latin army and the Byzantine fleet returned home , although half of the Byzantine fleet was lost in a sudden storm . 
 Despite the bad feelings generated at Damietta , Amalric still refused to abandon his dream of conquering Egypt , and he continued to seek good relations with the Byzantines in the hopes of another joined attack , which never took place . In 1171 Amalric came to Constantinople in person , after Egypt had fallen to Saladin . Manuel was thus able to organise a grand ceremonial reception which both honoured Amalric and underlined his dependence : for the rest of Amalric 's reign , Jerusalem was a Byzantine satellite , and Manuel was able to act as a protector of the Holy Places , exerting a growing influence in the Kingdom of Jerusalem . In 1177 , a fleet of 150 ships was sent by Manuel I to invade Egypt , but returned home after appearing off Acre due to the refusal of Count Philip of Flanders and many important nobles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem to help . 
 = = Kilij Arslan II and the Seljuk Turks = = 
 Between 1158 – 1162 , a series of Byzantine campaigns against the Seljuk Turks of the Sultanate of Rûm resulted in a treaty favourable to the Empire . According to the agreement , certain frontier regions , including the city of Sivas , should be handed over to Manuel in return for some quantity of cash , while it also obliged the Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II to recognize his overlordship . When it became clear to the Byzantines that the Seljuks had no intention of honouring their side of the bargain , as Kilij Arslan II had used the entente over time to <unk> his authority over the Danishmends , Manuel decided that it was time to deal with the Turks once and for all . Therefore , he assembled the full imperial army and marched against the Seljuk capital , Iconium ( Konya ) . Manuel 's strategy was to prepare the advanced bases of Dorylaeum and Sublaeum , and then to use them to strike as quickly as possible at Iconium . 
 Yet Manuel 's army of 35 @,@ 000 men was large and unwieldy – according to a letter that Manuel sent to King Henry II of England , the advancing column was ten miles ( 16 km ) long . Manuel marched against Iconium via Laodicea , <unk> , Lampe , <unk> , <unk> , and Antioch . Just outside the entrance to the pass at Myriokephalon , Manuel was met by Turkish ambassadors , who offered peace on generous terms . Most of Manuel 's generals and experienced courtiers urged him to accept the offer . The younger and more aggressive members of the court urged Manuel to attack , however , and he took their advice and continued his advance . 
 Manuel made serious tactical errors , such as failing to properly scout out the route ahead . These failings caused him to lead his forces straight into a classic ambush . On 17 September 1176 Manuel was decisively defeated by Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II at the Battle of Myriokephalon ( in highlands near the <unk> pass ) , in which his army was ambushed while marching through the narrow mountain pass . The Byzantines were too dispersed , and were surrounded . The army 's siege equipment was quickly destroyed , and Manuel was forced to withdraw – without siege engines , the conquest of Iconium was impossible . According to Byzantine sources , Manuel lost his nerve both during and after the battle , fluctuating between extremes of self @-@ delusion and self @-@ abasement ; according to William of Tyre , he was never the same again . 
 The terms by which Kilij Arslan II allowed Manuel and his army to leave were that he should remove his forts and armies on the frontier at Dorylaeum and Sublaeum . Since the Sultan had already failed to keep his side of the earlier treaty of 1162 , however , Manuel only ordered the fortifications of Sublaeum to be dismantled , but not the fortifications of Dorylaeum . Nevertheless , defeat at Myriokephalon was an embarrassment for both Manuel personally and also for his empire . The Komnenian emperors had worked hard since the Battle of Manzikert , 105 years earlier , to restore the reputation of the empire . Yet because of his over @-@ confidence , Manuel had demonstrated to the whole world that Byzantium still could not defeat the Seljuks , despite the advances made during the past century . In western opinion , Myriokephalon cut Manuel down to a humbler size : not that of Emperor of the Romans but that of King of the Greeks . 
 The defeat at Myriokephalon has often been depicted as a catastrophe in which the entire Byzantine army was destroyed . Manuel himself compared the defeat to Manzikert ; it seemed to him that the Byzantine defeat at Myriokephalon complemented the destruction at Manzikert . In reality , although a defeat , it was not too costly and did not significantly diminish the Byzantine army . Most of the casualties were borne by the right wing , largely composed of allied troops commanded by Baldwin of Antioch , and also by the baggage train , which was the main target of the Turkish ambush . The limited losses inflicted on native Byzantine troops were quickly recovered , and in the following year Manuel 's forces defeated a force of " picked Turks " . John Komnenos Vatatzes , who was sent by the Emperor to repel the Turkish invasion , not only brought troops from the capital but also was able to gather an army along the way , allowing him to score a victory over the Turks at the Battle of Hyelion and Leimocheir , a sign that the Byzantine army remained strong and that the defensive program of western Asia Minor was still successful . After the victory on the Meander , Manuel himself advanced with a small army to drive the Turks from <unk> , south of <unk> . In 1178 , however , a Byzantine army retreated after encountering a Turkish force at Charax , allowing the Turks to capture many livestock . The city of <unk> in Bithynia was besieged by the Turks in 1179 , forcing Manuel to lead a small cavalry force to save the city , and then , even as late as 1180 , the Byzantines succeeded in scoring a victory over the Turks . 
 The continuous warfare had a serious effect upon Manuel 's vitality ; he declined in health and in 1180 succumbed to a slow fever . Furthermore , like Manzikert , the balance between the two powers began to gradually shift – Manuel never again attacked the Turks , and after his death they began to move further west , deeper into Byzantine territory . 
 = = Doctrinal controversies ( 1156 – 1180 ) = = 
 Three major theological controversies occurred during Manuel 's reign . In 1156 – 1157 the question was raised whether Christ had offered himself as a sacrifice for the sins of the world to the Father and to the Holy Spirit only , or also to the Logos ( i.e. , to himself ) . In the end a synod held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula , that the Word made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the Holy Trinity , despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch @-@ elect <unk> <unk> . 
 Ten years later , a controversy arose as to whether the saying of Christ , " My Father is greater than I " , referred to his divine nature , to his human nature , or to the union of the two . Demetrius of Lampe , a Byzantine diplomat recently returned from the West , ridiculed the way the verse was interpreted there , that Christ was inferior to his father in his humanity but equal in his divinity . Manuel , on the other hand , perhaps with an eye on the project for Church union , found that the formula made sense , and prevailed over a majority in a synod convened on 2 March 1166 to decide the issue , where he had the support of the patriarch Luke <unk> and later Patriarch Michael III . Those who refused to submit to the synod 's decisions had their property confiscated or were exiled . The political dimensions of this controversy are apparent from the fact that a leading dissenter from the Emperor 's doctrine was his nephew Alexios Kontostephanos . 
 A third controversy sprung up in 1180 , when Manuel objected to the formula of solemn abjuration , which was exacted from Muslim converts . One of the more striking anathemas of this abjuration was that directed against the deity worshipped by Muhammad and his followers : 
 And before all , I <unk> the God of Muhammad about whom he [ Muhammad ] says , " He is God alone , God made of solid , hammer @-@ beaten metal ; He begets not and is not begotten , nor is there like unto Him any one . " 
 The emperor ordered the deletion of this anathema from the Church 's catechetical texts , a measure that provoked vehement opposition from both the Patriarch and bishops . 
 = = Chivalric narrations = = 
 Manuel is representative of a new kind of Byzantine ruler who was influenced by his contact with western Crusaders . He arranged jousting matches , even participating in them , an unusual and discomforting sight for the Byzantines . Endowed with a fine physique , Manuel has been the subject of exaggeration in the Byzantine sources of his era , where he is presented as a man of great personal courage . According to the story of his exploits , which appear as a model or a copy of the romances of chivalry , such was his strength and exercise in arms that Raymond of Antioch was incapable of wielding his lance and buckler . In a famous tournament , he is said to have entered the lists on a fiery courser , and to have overturned two of the stoutest Italian knights . In one day , he is said to have slain forty Turks with his own hand , and in a battle against the Hungarians he allegedly snatched a banner , and was the first , almost alone , who passed a bridge that separated his army from the enemy . On another occasion , he is said to have cut his way through a squadron of five hundred Turks , without receiving a wound ; he had previously posted an <unk> in a wood and was accompanied only by his brother and Axouch .

 Manuel had several illegitimate children :
