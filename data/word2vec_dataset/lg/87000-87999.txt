 = = = Cosmic rays = = = 
 By the early 1930s , Compton had become interested in cosmic rays . At the time , their existence was known but their origin and nature remained speculative . Their presence could be detected using a spherical " bomb " containing compressed air or argon gas and measuring its electrical conductivity . Trips to Europe , India , Mexico , Peru and Australia gave Compton the opportunity to measure cosmic rays at different altitudes and latitudes . Along with other groups who made observations around the globe , they found that cosmic rays were 15 per cent more intense at the poles than at the equator . Compton attributed this to the effect of cosmic rays being made up principally of charged particles , rather than photons as Robert Millikan had suggested , with the latitude effect being due to Earth 's magnetic field .

 In April 1941 , Vannevar Bush , head of the wartime National Defense Research Committee ( NDRC ) , created a special committee headed by Compton to report on the NDRC uranium program . Compton 's report , which was submitted in May 1941 , foresaw the prospects of developing radiological weapons , nuclear propulsion for ships , and nuclear weapons using uranium @-@ 235 or the recently discovered plutonium . In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb . For this report , he worked with Enrico Fermi on calculations of the critical mass of uranium @-@ 235 , conservatively estimating it to be between 20 kilograms ( 44 lb ) and 2 tonnes ( 2 @.@ 0 long tons ; 2 @.@ 2 short tons ) . He also discussed the prospects for uranium enrichment with Harold Urey , spoke with Eugene Wigner about how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor , and with Robert Serber about how the plutonium produced in a reactor might be separated from uranium . His report , submitted in November , stated that a bomb was feasible , although he was more conservative about its destructive power than Mark Oliphant and his British colleagues . 
 The final draft of Compton 's November report made no mention of using plutonium , but after discussing the latest research with Ernest Lawrence , Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible . In December , Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project . He hoped to achieve a controlled chain reaction by January 1943 , and to have a bomb by January 1945 . To tackle the problem , he had the different research groups working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design at Columbia University , Princeton University and the University of California , Berkeley , concentrated together as the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago . Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium , to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium , and to design and build an atomic bomb . 
 In June 1942 , the United States Army Corps of Engineers assumed control of the nuclear weapons program and Compton 's Metallurgical Laboratory became part of the Manhattan Project . That month , Compton gave Robert Oppenheimer responsibility for bomb design . It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs that the Metallurgical Laboratory scientists had devised should be pursued , even though a successful reactor had not yet been built . 
 When labor disputes delayed construction of the Metallurgical Laboratory 's new home in the Red Gate Woods , Compton decided to build Chicago Pile @-@ 1 , the first nuclear reactor , under the stands at Stagg Field . Under Fermi 's direction , it went critical on December 2 , 1942 . Compton arranged for Mallinckrodt to undertake the purification of uranium ore , and with DuPont to build the plutonium semi @-@ works at Oak Ridge , Tennessee . 
 A major crisis for the plutonium program occurred in July 1943 , when Emilio Segrè 's group confirmed that plutonium created in the X @-@ 10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge contained high levels of plutonium @-@ 240 . Its spontaneous fission ruled out the use of plutonium in a gun @-@ type nuclear weapon . Oppenheimer 's Los Alamos Laboratory met the challenge by designing and building an implosion @-@ type nuclear weapon . 
 Compton was at the Hanford site in September 1944 to watch the first reactor being brought online . The first batch of uranium slugs was fed into Reactor B at Hanford in November 1944 , and shipments of plutonium to Los Alamos began in February 1945 . Throughout the war , Compton would remain a prominent scientific adviser and administrator . In 1945 , he served , along with Lawrence , Oppenheimer , and Fermi , on the Scientific Panel that recommended military use of the atomic bomb against Japan . He was awarded the Medal for Merit for his services to the Manhattan Project .

 After the war ended , Compton resigned his chair as Charles H. Swift Distinguished Service Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago and returned to Washington University in St. Louis , where he was inaugurated as the university 's ninth Chancellor in 1946 . During Compton 's time as Chancellor , the university formally desegregated its undergraduate divisions in 1952 , named its first female full professor , and enrolled record numbers of students as wartime veterans returned to the United States . His reputation and connections in national scientific circles allowed him to recruit many nationally renowned scientific researchers to the university . Despite Compton 's accomplishments , he was criticized then , and subsequently by historians , for moving too slowly toward full racial integration , making Washington University the last major institution of higher learning in St. Louis to open its doors to African Americans . 
 Compton retired as Chancellor in 1954 , but remained on the faculty as Distinguished Service Professor of Natural Philosophy until his retirement from the full @-@ time faculty in 1961 . In retirement he wrote Atomic Quest , a personal account of his role in the Manhattan Project , which was published in 1956 . 
 = = Philosophy = = 
 Compton was one of a handful of scientists and philosophers to propose a two @-@ stage model of free will . Others include William James , Henri Poincaré , Karl Popper , Henry <unk> , and Daniel Dennett . In 1931 , Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on quantum indeterminacy and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world . In his somewhat bizarre mechanism , he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier , anticipating the Schrödinger 's cat paradox , which was published in 1935 . 
 Reacting to criticisms that his ideas made chance the direct cause of people 's actions , Compton clarified the two @-@ stage nature of his idea in an Atlantic Monthly article in 1955 . First there is a range of random possible events , then one adds a determining factor in the act of choice . 
 A set of known physical conditions is not adequate to specify precisely what a forthcoming event will be . These conditions , insofar as they can be known , define instead a range of possible events from among which some particular event will occur . When one exercises freedom , by his act of choice he is himself adding a factor not supplied by the physical conditions and is thus himself determining what will occur . That he does so is known only to the person himself . From the outside one can see in his act only the working of physical law . It is the inner knowledge that he is in fact doing what he intends to do that tells the actor himself that he is free . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Compton died in Berkeley , California , from a cerebral hemorrhage on March 15 , 1962 . He was survived by his wife and sons , and buried in the Wooster Cemetery in Wooster , Ohio . 
 Compton received many awards in his lifetime , including the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1927 , the Matteucci Gold Medal in 1933 , the Royal Society 's Hughes Medal and the Franklin Institute 's Benjamin Franklin Medal in 1940 . He is commemorated in various ways . The Compton crater on the Moon is co @-@ named for Compton and his brother Karl . The physics research building at Washington University in St Louis is named in his honor . Compton invented a more gentle , elongated , and ramped version of the speed bump called the " Holly hump , " many of which are on the roads of the Washington University campus . The University of Chicago Residence Halls remembered Compton and his achievements by dedicating Arthur H. Compton House in Chicago in his honor . It is now listed as a National Historic Landmark . Compton also has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame . NASA 's Compton Gamma Ray Observatory was named in honor of Compton . The Compton effect is central to the gamma ray detection instruments aboard the observatory . 
 = Lockheed Have Blue = 
 Lockheed Have Blue was the code name for Lockheed 's demonstrator ( i.e. , " proof of concept " ) that preceded the F @-@ 117 Nighthawk production stealth aircraft . Have Blue was designed by Lockheed 's Skunk Works division , and tested at Groom Lake , Nevada . The Have Blue was the first fixed @-@ wing aircraft designed from an electrical engineering ( rather than an aerospace engineering ) perspective . The aircraft 's plate @-@ like , faceted shape was designed to deflect electromagnetic waves in directions other than that of the originating radar emitter , greatly reducing its radar cross @-@ section . Two flyable vehicles were constructed , but both crashed during the flight @-@ test program . 
 In the 1970s , it became increasingly apparent to U.S. planners that , in a military confrontation with Warsaw Pact forces , NATO aircraft would quickly suffer heavy losses . This came as a result of sophisticated Soviet defense networks , which used surveillance radars and radar @-@ guided surface @-@ to @-@ air missiles ( SAM ) and anti @-@ aircraft artillery to seek and eliminate enemy aircraft . Consequently , the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency ( DARPA ) started a study on low @-@ observability aircraft , seeking to design and produce an operational stealth aircraft . Five companies were initially invited , three of which bowed out early . The remaining two were later joined by Lockheed . 
 To design the aircraft , the Skunk Works ' design team devised a computer program to calculate the radar cross @-@ sections ( RCS ) of various designs . The eventual design characteristically featured faceted surfaces to deflect radar waves elsewhere . It had highly @-@ swept wings and inward @-@ canted vertical stabilizers , which led to its being nicknamed " Hopeless Diamond " . The first operational aircraft made its maiden flight on 1 December 1977 . The flight test program validated the feasibility of a flyable stealth aircraft . However , both prototypes were lost due to mechanical problems . Nevertheless , Have Blue was deemed a success , paving the way for the first operational stealth aircraft , Senior Trend , or F @-@ 117 Nighthawk .

 = = = Origins = = = 
 The Lockheed Have Blue was born out of a requirement to evade radar detection . During the Vietnam War , radar @-@ guided surface @-@ to @-@ air missiles ( SAM ) and anti @-@ aircraft artillery ( AAA ) posed a significant threat to US aircraft . As such , strike aircraft during the war often required support aircraft to perform combat air patrols and suppression of enemy air defenses ( SEAD ) . The 1973 Yom Kippur War again highlighted the vulnerability of aircraft to SAMs – the Israeli Air Force lost 109 aircraft in 18 days . During the Cold War , the Soviet Union developed an integrated defense network , central to which were medium- to long @-@ range surveillance radars . SAMs and <unk> would be set up around key locations to defend them from incoming enemy aircraft . If the loss ratio of Israel during the Yom Kippur War was experienced by NATO forces during a military confrontation with the Warsaw Pact , NATO aircraft numbers would be depleted within two weeks . 
 In 1974 , DARPA secretly requested answers from five aircraft manufacturers regarding two considerations . The first was about the signature thresholds at which an aircraft is virtually undetectable . The second point was whether these companies had the capacity to design and manufacture such an aircraft . Fairchild and Grumman declined to participate , while General Dynamics insisted on the use of electronic countermeasures . As a result , General Dynamics left the discussion . The remaining two companies , McDonnell Douglas and Northrop , were each awarded $ 100 @,@ 000 for further research . 
 = = = Design effort and early testing = = = 
 Lockheed , having been absent from the fighter aircraft industry for 10 years , was not approached by DARPA in 1974 . Ed Martin , Lockheed California Companies director of science and engineering , became aware of the research into stealth during his work at the Pentagon and Wright @-@ Patterson AFB . Martin and Ben Rich , who at that time had recently become Skunk Works ' president , briefed Clarence " Kelly " Johnson on the program . The Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) gave Skunk Works permission to discuss with DARPA on the stealth characteristics of the A @-@ 12 and D @-@ 21 . Rich and Martin formally requested DARPA for the company to participate in the program , but the agency initially refused because there were insufficient funds ; after much debate , Lockheed was allowed entry , albeit without a government contract . 
 Preliminary designer Dick Scherrer requested possible shapes upon which he could base his low radar cross @-@ section ( RCS ) design . He was introduced to Denys Overholser , who recommended an aircraft with flat surfaces . Overholser later recounted his discussion with <unk> : " When Dick Scherrer asked me ... I said ' Well , it 's simple , you just make it out of flat surfaces , and tilt those flat surfaces over , sweeping the edges away from the radar view angle , and that way you basically cause the energy to reflect away from the radar . ' " <unk> subsequently drew a preliminary low @-@ RCS aircraft with faceted surfaces . At the same time , Overholser hired mathematician Bill Schroeder , with whom he had a prior working relationship – in fact , it was Schroeder who trained Overholser on mathematics relating to stealth aircraft . Kenneth Watson was hired as the senior lead aircraft designer . 
 During the next few weeks , the team created a computer program which could evaluate the RCS of possible designs . The RCS @-@ prediction software was called " ECHO 1 " . As tests with the program proceeded , it became apparent that edge calculations by the program were incorrect due to diffraction . In 1964 , Pyotr <unk> , the chief scientist of the Moscow Institute for Radio Engineering , published a seminal paper titled Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction . The work was translated by the Air Force Systems Command 's Foreign <unk> Division ; subsequently , Overholser incorporated elements of <unk> 's work to refine the software . ECHO 1 allowed the team to quickly decide which of the 20 possible designs were optimal , finally settling on the faceted delta @-@ wing design . However , many within the division were skeptical of the shape , giving rise to the name " Hopeless Diamond " – Kelly Johnson said to Rich , " Our old D @-@ 21 drone has a lower radar cross @-@ section than that goddamn diamond " . 
 In May 1975 , the Skunk Works produced an internal report titled , " Progress Report No. 2 , High Stealth Conceptual Studies . " Within it was a concept study called " Little Harvey , " including Kelly Johnson 's drawing of an aircraft with smoothly blended shapes . Johnson advocated for the use of blended shapes as the best way to achieve stealth , while Ben Rich advocated for faceted angles . Rich won the argument with Johnson , a rare occurrence . 
 The design effort produced a number of wooden models . A 24 @-@ inch long model , made of balsa wood , demonstrated placement of internal structure and access doors . An Air & Space article noted " The model shop found it nearly impossible to make all the flat surfaces come to a single point in one corner . Engineers later encountered the same difficulty fabricating the prototype on the factory floor . " For early tests of the design , two ⅓ -scale wooden mock @-@ ups were constructed . One model , coated in metal foil , was used to verify ECHO 1 's RCS calculations , while the other was earmarked for wind tunnel tests . Afterwards , a model was moved to the Grey Butte Range radar @-@ testing facility in the Mojave Desert near Palmdale , which allowed more accurate tests of the aircraft 's RCS . In the event , the aircraft 's RCS level confirmed ECHO 1 's predictions . This meant Ben Rich won a quarter from Johnson , who previously insisted that the D @-@ 21 had less RCS than Have Blue . 
 = = = Experimental <unk> Testbed = = = 
 In the summer of 1975 , DARPA informally invited Lockheed , Northrop and McDonnell Douglas to develop an aircraft under the name " Experimental <unk> Testbed " ( XST ) . McDonnell Douglas , having identified the thresholds at which aircraft were deemed undetectable , was unable to design and produce such an aircraft . Phase 1 of XST would see both Lockheed and Northrop build full @-@ scale models to test their RCS , construct flyable vehicles , and wind @-@ tunnel test their designs . Following Phase 1 , a sole contractor would be selected to continue with the construction and flight testing of two demonstrators as part of Phase 2 . Northrop 's and Lockheed 's designs were generally similar , though the former 's submission featured more angular and flat surfaces . The company used " <unk> " , software similar to ECHO 1 , to calculate the RCS of its designs . 
 On 1 November 1975 , Lockheed and Northrop were each awarded $ 1 @.@ 5 @-@ million contracts to proceed with Phase 1 of XST . During a four @-@ month period , the two companies were each required to construct full @-@ scale wooden mock @-@ ups , which would then be evaluated at the USAF 's Radar Target Scatter ( <unk> ) test facility at White Sands , New Mexico . To test the design 's radar returns , Lockheed erected a $ 187 @,@ 000 specially built pole upon which the model would be perched . In March 1976 , a Lockheed model was transferred to the range before being tested ; the following month Lockheed was pronounced the winner because the Northrop XST had a much higher side hemisphere RCS . DARPA , having realized the progress accumulated throughout the study , urged the Northrop team to remain together . The agency would later initiate the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft @-@ Experimental ( <unk> ) , which evolved into the <unk> Blue and , ultimately , the B @-@ 2 bomber . 
 = = = Construction and further tests = = = 
 Skunk Works now had to design , construct and flight test two manned demonstrators as part of Phase 2 , or Have Blue . To build the demonstrators , Ben Rich had to raise $ 10 @.@ 4 million from the Lockheed management , which was secured by June . Phase 2 encompassed three main objectives , which were the validation of : reduced visibility in the radio wave , infrared , and visual spectrums and reduced acoustical observability ; acceptable flying qualities ; and the " modeling capabilities that accurately predict low observable characteristics of an aircraft in flight " . 
 Construction of both Have Blue demonstrators used leftover tools from the C @-@ 5 program . Final assembly of HB1001 was originally scheduled to end in August 1977 , before being ground tested until mid @-@ October . The secret roll @-@ out was envisaged to occur on 23 October , after which the aircraft would be dismantled and flown to the test area . On 1 September , however , with HB1001 partially complete , Lockheed machinists went on a four @-@ month strike . A group of managers instead took over the job of assembly , which was completed in six weeks , with ground tests beginning on 17 October . 
 While superficially similar to the later F @-@ 117 , the Have Blue prototypes were smaller aircraft , about one quarter the weight of the F @-@ 117 , with a wing sweep of 72 @.@ 5 ° and inward @-@ canted vertical tails ( inverse V @-@ tail ) . Radar @-@ absorbent material ( RAM ) , developed in a Lockheed laboratory , were applied to the aircraft 's flat surfaces – for the windscreen , special coatings were applied to give them metallic characteristics . The aircraft 's gross weight of 9 @,@ 200 – 12 @,@ 500 lb ( 4 @,@ 173 – 5 @,@ 669 kg ) enabled the aircraft to use the landing gear from the Northrop F @-@ 5 fighter . The aircraft 's powerplants were two 2 @,@ 950 @-@ pound @-@ force ( 13 @.@ 1 kN ) General Electric J85 @-@ GE @-@ 4As of the T @-@ 2B Buckeye . Because stealth took precedence above all else , the aircraft was inherently unstable . As a result , a quadruple redundant fly @-@ by @-@ wire ( FBW ) flight control system was integrated into the aircraft to give it normal flying characteristics . The flight control system was borrowed from the F @-@ 16 . The overwing engine inlet was covered by a low @-@ RCS grid ; during takeoffs , when more air is needed , blow @-@ in doors were constructed at the upper fuselage to admit additional airflow . 
 Throughout the one and a half months after the start of ground tests , HB1001 , the first of two demonstrators , underwent tests in preparations for the first flight . Flight instrumentation was checked first , followed by a thorough shakedown of the aircraft . In early November , two semi @-@ trailers were parked parallel to each other outside Building 82 ; a camouflage net was thrown over the top to cover the demonstrator during outdoor engine runs . During the engine tests , a local resident complained about the noise , but Have Blue retained its secrecy . HB1001 received a layer of iron @-@ coat paint ; during the weekend of 12 – 13 November , the aircraft received a camouflage scheme devised by Alan Brown , Have Blue 's chief technical engineer . The scheme , consisting of three colors , each with three tones , was used to deceive any casual onlooker from recognizing the design 's characteristic faceting . The aircraft was disassembled and loaded onto a C @-@ 5 – on 16 November , the aircraft was flown from Burbank Airport ( since renamed Bob Hope Airport ) to Area 51 at Groom Lake , Nevada . Upon touchdown , the aircraft was reassembled before undergoing another round of testing prior to the first flight . After four taxi tests , HB1001 was ready for test flights .

 = = = HB1001 = = = 
 HB1001 made its first flight on 1 December 1977 at the hands of Lockheed test pilot , Bill Park . He would fly the next four sorties , all chased by a T @-@ 38 piloted by Major ( later Lieutenant Colonel ) Ken Dyson . Dyson , an F @-@ 15 Eagle pilot , was previously approached by United States Air Force personnel about the project in 1976 . He made his first flight on HB1001 on 17 January 1978 , chased by Park . In fact , the two would be the only test pilots of Have Blue , alternating between the demonstrator and the chase plane . Flight test results allowed engineers to refine the FBW system . At the same time , they verified predictions made earlier by aerodynamic engineers on the aircraft 's behavior . 
 Flight tests proceeded fairly smoothly until 4 May 1978 , when HB1001 was making its 36th flight . The aircraft pitched up just as it made contact with the ground which forced the pilot , Bill Park , to abort the landing and make a second attempt . The impact had however been so hard that the landing gear had become jammed in a semi @-@ retracted position . Efforts to lower the gear were unsuccessful and Bill Park was forced to eject at 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) when fuel ran out . The aircraft was destroyed on impact in the vicinity of the Groom Lake facility . Park survived , but suffered a concussion , forcing him to retire from further test flights . Dyson , who was in the chase plane , recounted : " Just before touchdown the airplane pitched up ... It seemed it slammed down on the ground real hard ... He [ Park ] raised the gear on the go around , and when he tried to extend it on approach , only one of the mains and the nose wheel came down . All this time , gas was being consumed ... I suggested he climb up to 10 @,@ 000 feet for ejection ... He started climbing , but the engine started flaming out , from the lack of fuel , so he ejected . " 
 = = = HB1002 = = = 
 At the time of the crash , HB1002 was almost complete , with the lessons learned from the HB1001 incorporated into the aircraft , including the rebuilding of the aft fuselage . HB1002 was distinguished from the prototype in having a gray paint coat . It did not have the flight test instrumentation boom present on HB1001 's nose . As the aircraft was used to test RCS returns , the <unk> spin recovery chute was removed , and the aircraft was covered in radar @-@ absorbent material . It first flew on 20 July 1978 with Dyson at the controls , who would be the only pilot to fly the aircraft . 
 HB1002 was lost on 11 July 1979 during the aircraft 's 52nd flight . A hydraulic leak caused an engine fire , resulting in the loss of hydraulic pressure , which in turn caused severe pitch oscillations . The pilot ejected safely , and the aircraft was destroyed . It was later discovered that an engine exhaust clamp had loosened , allowing the hot exhaust to migrate to the right engine compartment . The heat built up there , causing the hydraulic lines to fail . The debris from both aircraft was secretly buried somewhere within the Nellis complex . Despite the crashes , Have Blue was considered a success . 
 = = = Senior Trend = = = 
 In October 1977 , just prior to Phase 2 of the XST competition , Lockheed was tasked with exploring possible operational aircraft . Just a month later , on the day HB1001 was transported to Groom Lake , the Air Force awarded the company a contract under the code name Senior Trend . The Air Force wanted to exploit the revolutionary technologies developed during the Have Blue program . The Tactical Air Command ordered five full @-@ scale development and twenty production aircraft . 
 Based on the Have Blue demonstrators , Senior Trend aircraft were different from their predecessors in several aspects . The wings exhibited less sweep to resolve a center @-@ of @-@ gravity problem discovered during tests . The front fuselage was shortened to give the pilot a better view . And , the vertical stabilizers were canted outwards from the centerline . Additionally , provisions were made to include two weapons bays , each of which would accommodate a single 2 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 910 kg ) laser @-@ guided bomb , or the B61 tactical nuclear bomb . 
 Beset by early construction problems , the first FSD aircraft was transferred to Groom Lake in May 1981 inside a C @-@ 5 . Further problems , this time with fuel leaks , delayed the first flight . Under the control of Harold Farley , the aircraft took off on 18 June for its maiden flight , nine months after the July 1980 first flight originally envisaged . The first production F @-@ 117A was delivered in 1982 , and operational capability was achieved in October 1983 ; the 59th and last F @-@ 117 was delivered in 1990 .

 = William Barley = 
 William Barley ( 1565 ? – 1614 ) was an English bookseller and publisher . He completed an apprenticeship as a draper in 1587 , but was soon working in the London book trade . As a freeman of the Drapers ' Company , he was embroiled in a dispute between it and the Stationers ' Company over the rights of drapers to function as publishers and booksellers . He found himself in legal tangles throughout his life . 
 Barley 's role in Elizabethan music publishing has proved to be a contentious issue among scholars . The assessments of him range from " a man of energy , determination , and ambition " , to " somewhat remarkable " , to " surely to some extent a rather nefarious figure " . His contemporaries harshly criticized the quality of two of the first works of music that he published , but he was also influential in his field . 
 Barley became the assignee of the Thomas Morley , who as well as being a composer held a printing patent ( a monopoly of music publishing ) . He published Anthony Holborne 's Pavans , <unk> , <unk> ( 1599 ) , the first work of music for instruments rather than voices to be printed in England . His partnership with Morley enabled him to claim rights to music books , but was short @-@ lived . Morley gave work to the printer Thomas East , and died in 1602 . Some publishers ignored Barley 's claims , and many music books printed during his later life gave him no recognition . 
 = = Drapers ' Company = = 
 In a deposition of 1598 , Barley refers to his age as " <unk> <unk> or <unk> " , placing his date of birth around 1565 . Evidence suggests that Barley may have been born in Warwickshire . Little else is known about his early life . Barley was in London by 1587 , having completed an apprenticeship with the Drapers ' Company in that year . He trained as a bookseller under <unk> James , a small @-@ time publisher . James operated out of a shop in Newgate Market , near Christ Church Gate , in the 1580s . His interest in ballads was shared by Barley , who published a number of them during his lifetime . By 1592 , Barley had opened his own shop in the parish of St Peter upon Cornhill , whose register recorded his marriage to a Mary Harper on 15 June 1603 and christenings and burials of people associated with his family . He conducted business out of this shop for the next twenty years . 
 Barley is probably the same William Barley who opened a branch office in Oxford . This action brought him into conflict with the authorities . Barley most likely relied on his assistant , William Davis , to run the Oxford shop while he maintained the business at St Peter upon Cornhill . Davis was arrested in 1599 because Barley had failed to register as a bookseller with Oxford University . The two redeemed themselves though , and in 1603 , Barley and Davis were admitted as " privileged persons " of Oxford University . Privileged status at Oxford allowed tradesmen to practice their trade free from the jurisdiction of the town 's authorities . 
 Barley ran afoul of London authorities as well . In September 1591 , a warrant was issued for his arrest , although the charge is unknown . Barley also found himself in the midst of a longstanding feud between the Drapers ' Company and the Stationers ' Company . At the time , the latter held a monopoly over the publishing industry ; the Drapers ' Company wanted its members to be able to function as publishers and booksellers as well , insisting that it was the " custom of the City " to grant its freemen the right to engage in the book trade . 
 From 1591 to 1604 , Barley was associated with at least 57 works . The exact nature of his involvement is , at times , hard to identify . Some works were printed " for " him , others were " to be sold by " him , and two state that they were printed " by " him . He partnered with notable printers and publishers during this period , including Thomas Creede , Abel Jeffes , and John Danter . With Creede , Barley was involved in the publication of A Looking Glass for London and England ( 1594 ) and The True Tragedy of Richard III ( 1594 ) . During this period , Barley entered none of these works in the Stationers ' Register ( by entering a title into the register , a publisher recorded their rights to the work ) . This is probably due to the Stationers ' feud with the Drapers ' ; the Stationers ' viewed the ability of non @-@ members to enter works into the register as a special privilege . Thus , Barley relied on others , such as Creede , Jeffes , and Danter , to enter these titles . Whether Barley merely acted as a bookseller for the <unk> or , in private agreements with them , actually retained the rights to some of the works remains unclear . 
 In 1595 , the Stationers ' Company fined Barley 40 shillings for illicitly publishing a number of works . Three years later , the organization sued him and a fellow draper , Simon Stafford , for allegedly publishing privileged books . A raid on Barley 's former premises found 4 @,@ 000 copies of the Accidence , a Latin grammar book protected by monopoly . Despite pleading his innocence in court , Barley , along with Stafford , Edward <unk> , and Thomas Pavier ( who was Barley 's apprentice ) , was found guilty and sentenced to prison . The lawsuit affirmed the Stationers ' Company 's control over the Elizabethan book trade . Stafford , Pavier , and other draper @-@ booksellers joined the company within a few years so that they could continue their trade . Curiously , Barley did not join them until 1606 . The reasons for the delay are debated among scholars . <unk> J. A. Lavin suggests that the Stationers ' Company rejected Barley because he had no experience in the printing business . Gerald D. Johnson believes that his partnership with Thomas Morley , who held a royal patent on music publishing , allowed him to circumvent any legal obstacles . The Stationers ' Company could not interfere with the publication of works under royal grant . 
 = = Music publishing = = 
 In Elizabethan England , music printing was regulated by two royal patents issued by the queen : one for metrical psalters ( psalms set to music ) and one for all other types of music and music paper . The patent @-@ holders thus held a monopoly — only they or their assignees could legally print music . After printer John Day 's death in 1584 , the patent for metrical psalters transferred to his son Richard Day and was administered by his assignees , who were members of the Stationers ' Company . The more general one was awarded to composers Thomas Tallis and William Byrd in January 1575 . Despite the monopoly , Tallis and Byrd were not successful in their printing endeavors ; their 1575 collection of Latin motets called Cantiones quae ab <unk> sacrae <unk> failed to sell and was a financial disaster . After Tallis died in 1585 , Byrd continued holding the patent , producing works with his assignee , Thomas East . The monopoly expired in 1596 , prompting prospective music publishers such as Barley to take advantage of the resulting power vacuum . 
 In 1596 , despite not having access to a proper music fount , Barley ( using the services of Danter and his wood blocks ) published The Pathway to Music , a music theory book , and A New Booke of <unk> , a tutor for the lute and related instruments that included compositions by John Dowland , Philip <unk> , and Anthony Holborne . Both featured numerous errors , and for the latter , Barley seems not to have gained prior publishing approval from the composers . Dowland disowned A New Booke of <unk> , calling his lute lessons " <unk> and <unk> " , while Holborne complained of " corrupt <unk> " of his work being presented by a " <unk> stranger " . Modern musicologists have labelled the publication " exasperating " and " seedy " . Morley criticized The Pathway to Music , stating that the author should be " ashamed of his labour " , and that " [ v ] ix est in toto <unk> sana libro " ( " there is scarcely a page that makes sense in the whole book " ) . Despite their flaws , both works seem to have been instrumental in introducing music tutor books to the London market . 
 Two years later , Morley was awarded the same printing monopoly that Byrd had held . Morley 's pick of Barley as an assignee ( rather than experienced printers such as East or Peter Short , both of whom had previously worked with Morley ) is surprising . Morley may have been looking for help in challenging the metrical psalter patent of Richard Day and his assignees . At that time , East and Short were stationers , and the Stationers ' Company was actively enforcing the Day monopoly . Barley , however , was not a stationer , and in 1599 he and Morley published The Whole Booke of Psalmes and Richard Allison 's Psalmes of David in Metre . The former was a small pocket edition that was largely based on East 's 1592 publication of the same name . This work , although pirated and filled with small errors , provides some evidence of Barley 's editorial skill ; musicologist Robert <unk> notes that if Barley " is to be discredited for <unk> , he must also be applauded for his strokes of musical imagination " for successfully compressing such a large work into a pocket @-@ sized production . In Allison 's work , the two claimed that they had exclusive rights on the metrical psalter . Duly provoked , Day sued . The outcome of his lawsuit is not known , but neither Barley nor Morley ever published another metrical psalter . 
 Under Morley , Barley published eight books . The covers of each indicated that they were " printed by " Barley , but examination of the typography reveals this to be unlikely . At least two of the works contain designs that seem to belong to a device used by London printer Henry Ballard . Significant among these eight works is Holborne 's Pavans , <unk> , <unk> ( 1599 ) , the first work of music for instruments rather than voices to be printed in England , and the first edition of Morley 's influential The First Booke of Consort Lessons ( 1599 ) . 
 = = Stationers ' Company = = 
 Barley 's relationship with Morley was short @-@ lived . By 1600 , Morley had turned to East as his assignee , authorizing him to print under his name for three years . Two years later , Morley died , and his music patent fell into abeyance . Unable to rely on the protections and privileges of Morley 's monopoly , Barley most likely came under increasing pressure from the Stationers ' Company . His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he was the target of a successful lawsuit by a cook named George Goodale , who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 pounds . As a result of the suit , many of Barley 's goods were seized , including various books and reams of paper . Barley greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605 , publishing only six works . 
 Barley evidently decided that it was futile to continue resisting the Stationers ' Company , and on 15 May 1605 , he successfully petitioned the Drapers ' Company for a transfer to the Stationers ' Company . On 25 June 1606 , the Stationers ' Company admitted him as a member . That same day , the Company 's court , which had the authority to resolve disputes between members , negotiated a settlement in a lawsuit Barley had brought against East concerning the copyrights on certain music books . East claimed that since he had lawfully entered the books into the Company 's register , the rights of the works belonged to him . Barley disagreed , claiming that the works were his through his partnership with Morley , who had held the royal music patent . The court 's compromise settlement recognized the rights of both , stipulating that if East were to print an edition of any of the books in question , he was to acknowledge Barley 's name on the imprint , pay Barley 20 shillings , and supply him with six free copies . On the other hand , Barley could not publish any of the books without the consent of East or his wife . 
 Despite the settlement recognizing his claim to Morley 's music patent , Barley seemingly found it difficult to enforce his rights , even with his new role as a stationer . Less than half of the known music books published from 1606 to 1613 recognized Barley 's rights on the imprint . Barley took Thomas Adams to the Stationers ' court in 1609 , challenging the copyrights of the music books Adams had published . The court handed down a settlement similar to the one between East and Barley . However , none of the music books Adams published afterward contained any recognition of Barley 's patent . 
 Barley himself published four books under his patent . In March 1612 , one of Barley 's servants died , possibly from plague . After receiving charitable remuneration from the Stationers ' Company , Barley moved , first to the parish of St Katherine Cree , and later to a house on Bishopsgate . Records from St Botolph @-@ without @-@ Bishopsgate indicate his burial on 11 July 1614 . His widow , Mary , and their son , William , were legatees of the will of Pavier . Mary Barley , who later remarried , transferred five of her husband 's patents to printer John Beale . Some of Barley 's remaining copyrights may have also been passed to the printer Thomas <unk> . 
 = Battle of St. Louis = 
 The Battle of St. Louis , Spanish San Luis , also known as the Battle of Fort San Carlos , was an unsuccessful British @-@ led attack on St. Louis ( a French settlement in Spanish Louisiana , founded on the west bank of the Mississippi , after the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) ) on May 26 , 1780 , during the Anglo @-@ Spanish War of 1779 – 1783 . A force , composed primarily of Indians and led by a former British militia commander , attacked the settlement . The settlement 's defenders , mostly local militia , under the command of Lieutenant Governor of Spanish Louisiana Fernando de Leyba , had fortified the town , as best they could and successfully withstood the attack . 
 A second simultaneous attack on the nearby American outpost at Cahokia , on the opposite bank of the Mississippi and technically in British @-@ controlled territory , was also repulsed . The retreating Indians destroyed crops and took captive civilians outside the protected area . The British failure effectively ended their attempts to gain control of the Mississippi River , during the war . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the entry of Spain into the American Revolutionary War in 1779 , British military planners in London wanted to secure the corridor of the Mississippi River against both Spanish and Patriot activity . Their plans included expeditions from West Florida to take New Orleans and other Spanish targets , and several expeditions to gain control of targets in the upper Mississippi , including the small town of St. Louis . The expedition from West Florida never got off the ground , since Bernardo de Gálvez , the Governor of Spanish Louisiana , had moved rapidly to gain control of British outposts on the lower Mississippi , and was threatening action against West Florida 's principal outposts of Mobile and Pensacola . 
 = = = British expedition = = = 
 The British expeditions from the north were organized by Patrick Sinclair , the military governor at Fort Michilimackinac in present @-@ day Michigan . Beginning in February 1780 he instructed fur traders to circulate through their territories , recruiting interested tribes for an expedition against St. Louis . The fur traders were offered the opportunity to control the fur trade in the upper parts of Spanish Louisiana as an incentive to participate . 
 Most of the force gathered at Prairie du Chien , where they were placed under the command of Emanuel Hesse , a former militia captain turned fur trader . The force numbered about two dozen fur traders and an estimated 750 to 1 @,@ 000 Indians when it left Prairie du Chien on May 2 . The largest contingent of the force was about 200 Sioux warriors led by Wapasha , with additional sizable companies from the Chippewa , Menominee , and Winnebago nations , and smaller numbers of warriors from other nations . The Chippewa chief <unk> was given overall command of the native forces . When the force reached Rock Island they were joined by about 250 men from the Sac and Fox nations . These warriors were somewhat reluctant to attack St. Louis , but Hesse gave them large gifts to secure their participation in the venture . The diversity within the expedition included some animosity among the tribes , for the Chippewa and Sioux in particular had a history of conflict with each other . However , Wapasha and <unk> promoted unity during the expedition . 
 = = = Spanish and American defenses = = = 
 The village of St. Louis was primarily a trading hub on the Mississippi River , but it was also the administrative capital of Upper Spanish Louisiana , and it was governed by Lieutenant Governor Fernando de Leyba , who was also a captain in the Spanish Army . Leyba was warned in late March 1780 by a fur trader that the British were planning an attack on St. Louis and the nearby American @-@ held post at Cahokia . He began developing plans for the village 's defense . He had only 29 regular army soldiers of the Fijo de Luisiana Colonial Regiment and an inexperienced militia force of 168 , most of whom were dispersed in the surrounding countryside . 
 Leyba developed a grand plan of defense that included the construction of four stone towers . Without funds , or the time to get them from New Orleans , Leyba asked the villagers to contribute funds and labor to the construction of these fortifications , and paid for some of the work from his private funds . By mid @-@ May a single round tower had been built that was about 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) in diameter and thirty to forty feet tall . The tower , dubbed Fort San Carlos , provided a commanding view of the surrounding countryside . As there did not appear to be sufficient time to build more towers , trenches were dug between the tower and the river to the north and south of the village . Five cannon were placed on top of the tower , and additional cannon were placed along the trenches . 
 With a force of only 197 men , 168 of which were inexperienced militia , it was highly probable that the opposing British @-@ Indian force of 1 @,@ 000 would overwhelm the Fort San Carlos . However , Leyba appealed to a 70 year old French <unk> , Francois Valle , who was located 60 miles to the South of the fort at the site of the French Colonial Valles Mines . Valle sent his two sons and 151 well trained and equipped French militia men which tipped the scale in favor of the defenders . By Royal Decree on April 1 , 1782 , King Carlos III of Spain , conferred upon Francois Valle the rank of lieutenant in the regular Spanish army thus making him a Spanish don . ( citation : Colonial Ste . Genevieve : An Adventure on the Mississippi Frontier written by Carl J. Ekberg , Patrice Pr ; 2 Sub Edition , March 1996 ) . 
 Valle also greatly aided in the Battle of Fort San Carlos because he gave the defenders of both forts a major tactical advantage by supplying them with genuine lead ( instead of pebbles or stones ) from his mines for musket balls and cannonballs . Getting hit with a pebble or stone did not compare to the damage and knockdown power of a 52 caliber rifle ball at 100 feet . [ see http : / / <unk> / France in the American Revolutionary War ] 
 As a result of his contributions , Francois Valle was called the " Defender of St. Louis " [ see http : / / <unk> / <unk> / <unk> ] . 
 On May 15 , Leyba was visited by John Montgomery , the American commander at Cahokia , who proposed a joint Spanish @-@ American force to counter Hesse 's expedition , an idea that did not reach fruition . On May 23 , Leyba 's scouts reported that Hesse 's force was only 14 miles ( 23 km ) away , had landed their canoes , and were coming overland . 
 = = Battle = = 
 On May 25 , Hesse sent out scouting parties to determine the situation at St. Louis . These parties were unable to get close to the village due to the presence of workers , including women and children , in the fields outside the village . The next day Hesse sent Jean @-@ Marie Ducharme and 300 Indians across the river to attack Cahokia , while the remainder headed toward St. Louis , arriving about 1 : 00 pm . A warning shot was fired from the tower when they came in view , with the Sioux and <unk> leading the way , followed by the Sac and Fox , and the fur traders , including Hesse , bringing up the rear . Leyba directed the defense from the tower , and opened a withering fire from there and the trenches when the enemy force came in range . On the first volley , most of the Sac and Fox fell back , apparently unwilling to fight , leaving many of the other participants suspicious of their motives in joining the expedition and complaining of their " treachery " . 
 Wapasha and the Sioux persisted for several hours in attempts to draw the Spanish defenders out , going so far as brutally killing some captives they had taken in the fields . Although this angered some of the townspeople to the point where the militia requested permission to make a sortie , Leyba refused , and the attackers eventually withdrew and headed north , destroying crops , livestock , and buildings as they went . 
 On the other side of the river , Ducharme 's attack on Cahokia was easily repulsed . The timely arrival of George Rogers Clark to lead its defense played a role ; Clark 's reputation as a frontier fighter made the Indian force reluctant to pursue the attack . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The village of 700 lost between 50 and 100 killed , wounded , and captured , virtually all civilians . A year later the Spaniards from St. Louis raided Fort St. Joseph , bringing the captured British flag back to St. Louis . 
 Fernando de Leyba died the following month , the subject of local criticism because he never formally recognized the efforts made by the citizenry in the town 's defense . His valor earned him a promotion to lieutenant colonel from King Charles , who did not know that he had died .

 The site where Fort San Carlos stood is at the corner of Fourth and Walnut Streets in St. Louis . A local organization annually commemorates the battle by reading the names of 21 people who lost their lives in the battle .

 = Ray Jones ( footballer , born 1988 ) = 
 Raymond Barry <unk> " Ray " Jones ( 28 August 1988 – 25 August 2007 ) was an English professional footballer who played as a striker . He was known as one of the best young players in English football outside the Premier League . Jones spent his professional career at Queens Park Rangers , making his debut in the Football League Championship in April 2006 . His good form at the start of the following season led to his only international match , for England under @-@ 19 against the Netherlands , as well as bids for other clubs to sign him . He totalled six goals in 37 professional matches . 
 Jones died three days before his 19th birthday , when he drove head @-@ on into a bus in London . His club retired his shirt number of 31 . An inquest into the accident ruled that had Jones survived , he would have faced charges of death by dangerous driving for the deaths of his two passengers . 
 = = Career = = 
 Born in East Ham , London , Jones was rejected as a youth team player at Colchester United before impressing the coaches at Queens Park Rangers ( QPR ) . He made his professional debut on 22 April 2006 , coming on for the final seven minutes as a substitute for Steve Lomas in a 1 – 2 home loss to promotion @-@ chasing Watford . Eight days later , he made his only other appearance of the season , coming on for Stefan Bailey in the 68th minute of a defeat by the same score away to the already @-@ crowned winners of the Football League Championship , Reading . 
 Jones had his first professional start on 12 August 2006 , in a 2 – 0 win over Southend United at Loftus Road . He assisted Nick Ward 's goal in the 41st minute , which gave QPR their first win of the new season . Brian Glanville of The Sunday Times opined that Jones and fellow youngster Dexter Blackstock combined in the forward line " as though they had been playing together for years " . Ten days later in the second round of the Football League Cup at home to Northampton Town , Jones came on for Marc Bircham in the 84th minute , and three minutes later headed Marcus <unk> 's cross for his first career goal , winning the match 3 – 2 . 
 On 5 September , Jones made his only international appearance , replacing Giles Barnes in a goalless friendly draw for England under @-@ 19 against the Netherlands at the <unk> Stadium in Walsall . Eighteen days later , he scored his first league goal , opening a 2 – 0 home win over Hull City , the first match of John Gregory 's tenure . Jones followed this the following weekend as QPR came from behind to win 2 – 1 at Southampton , scoring the decisive goal after rounding goalkeeper Kelvin Davis . On 17 November , as a substitute for Blackstock , Jones scored the only goal in a 1 – 0 away win over high @-@ flying Cardiff City , connecting with Ward 's cross with less than three minutes left of the match . 
 Many Premier League clubs showed interest in Jones after several solid performances , and Gregory at one point stated that he was resigned to him leaving . After scoring the only goal against Colchester on 1 January 2007 , he pledged his future to the club , and a week later as he signed a new three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year deal . In total , Jones played 37 games ( 19 as a substitute ) for QPR in all competitions , scoring six goals . 
 Colchester made a £ 200 @,@ 000 offer for Jones in June 2007 , which was rejected , but they made another bid the following day , which was also turned down . QPR 's West London derby rivals Fulham also bid for him , as did Derby County , who offered £ 5 @.@ 75 million for him and teammate Lee Cook . He missed the start of the 2007 – 08 season , in the last month of his life , due to a foot injury .

 Writing Jones ' obituary in The Guardian , QPR fan Benjie Goodhart remembered him as the club 's " own Wayne Rooney , the prodigy , all precocious talent and burgeoning potential " , and attributed him the essential qualities for a forward including strength , speed , intelligence and confidence . He was perceived by the supporters to be the epitome of a new era under manager Gregory and prospective new owner Flavio Briatore , and could do " things for real that his peers acted out on their games consoles " . In spite of his confidence and talent , Jones was humble , and took the London Underground back home from games alongside the supporters .

 Jones died in a car crash in East Ham in the early hours of 25 August 2007 when the vehicle he was driving collided with a bus . He had only become a licensed driver 23 days earlier . Two passengers in his car , Idris <unk> and Jess <unk> , were also killed ; <unk> received a letter later that day , inviting him to Fulham 's academy . Jones ' death was compared to that of <unk> Prince , a QPR youth player who was fatally stabbed the previous year at the age of 15 when breaking up a fight . Goodhart wrote that tributes would be " done particularly beautifully at QPR because , heartbreakingly , we 're getting rather good at it " . 
 As a mark of respect QPR postponed their upcoming game with Burnley , a team who in turn replaced it with an open training session with proceeds going to the charity of QPR 's choice . QPR also decided to retire the number 31 shirt in memory of Jones , who wore that shirt during his career . In their league game against Southampton on 1 September 2007 , all of the QPR players carried Jones ' name on the back of their shirts as a mark of respect . Ten days later , in the England U19 friendly against Belarus at Meadow Lane in Nottingham , a minute 's applause was held before the match . 
 An inquest in April 2008 found that Jones had sped over a pedestrian crossing on the wrong side of the road , leading to a head @-@ on collision . His death was recorded as an accident , but it was confirmed that had he survived , he would have been facing two charges of death by dangerous driving .

 For the artist , see Gheorghe <unk> . 
 Gheorghe I. Tătărescu ( also known as <unk> Tătărescu , with a slightly antiquated pet form of his given name ; 2 November 1886 – 28 March 1957 ) was a Romanian politician who served twice as Prime Minister of Romania ( 1934 – 1937 ; 1939 – 1940 ) , three times as Minister of Foreign Affairs ( interim in 1934 and 1938 ; appointed to the office in 1945 @-@ 1947 ) , and once as Minister of War ( 1934 ) . Representing the " young liberals " faction inside the National Liberal Party ( PNL ) , Tătărescu began his political career as a collaborator of Ion G. Duca , becoming noted for his anti @-@ Communism and , in time , for his conflicts with the PNL 's leader Dinu Brătianu and the Foreign Minister Nicolae Titulescu . During his first time in office , he moved closer to King Carol II , leading an ambivalent policy toward the fascist Iron Guard and ultimately becoming instrumental in establishing the authoritarian and corporatist regime around the National Renaissance Front . In 1940 , he accepted the cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union , and consequently had to resign . 
 After the start of World War II , Gheorghe Tătărescu initiated a move to rally political forces in opposition to Ion Antonescu 's dictatorship , and sought an alliance with the Romanian Communist Party ( PCR ) . He was twice expelled from the PNL , in 1938 and 1944 , creating instead his own group , the National Liberal Party @-@ Tătărescu , and representing it inside the Communist @-@ endorsed Petru Groza cabinet . In 1946 @-@ 1947 , he was also the President of the Romanian Delegation to the Peace Conference in Paris . After that moment , relations between Tătărescu and the PCR began to sour , and he was replaced from the leadership of both his own party and the Foreign Ministry when his name was implicated in the <unk> Affair . Following the Communist takeover , he was arrested and held as a political prisoner , while being called to testify in the trial of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu . He died soon after his release from prison . 
 Elected an honorary member of the Romanian Academy in 1937 , he was removed from his seat by the Communist authorities in 1948 . One of his brothers , Colonel Ștefan Tătărescu , was at some point the leader of a minor Nazi group , the National Socialist Party . 
 = = Early life and politics = = 
 Born in Târgu Jiu , Tătărescu studied at Carol I High School in Craiova . He later went to France , where he was awarded a doctorate from the University of Paris in 1912 , with a thesis on the Romanian parliamentary system ( Le régime <unk> et <unk> en Roumanie ) . He subsequently worked as a lawyer in Bucharest . He fathered a son , Tudor , and a daughter , Sanda ( married to the lawyer <unk> Negropontes in 1940 ) . 
 After joining the National Liberal Party ( PNL ) , he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in November 1919 , representing <unk> County . Among his first notable actions as a politician was an initiative to <unk> Nicolae L. Lupu , the Minister of Interior Affairs Ministry in the Romanian National Party @-@ Peasants ' Party cabinet , in answer to concerns that the executive was tolerating socialist agitation in the countryside . 
 He stood among the PNL 's " young liberals " faction ( as they were colloquially known ) , supporting free trade and a more authoritarian rule over the country around King Carol II , and opposing both the older generation of leaders ( who tended to advocate protectionism and a liberal democracy ) and the dissident group of Gheorghe I. Brătianu ( see National Liberal Party @-@ Brătianu ) . 
 Undersecretary in the Interior Affairs Ministry under several PNL cabinets ( beginning with that of Ion I. C. Brătianu in 1922 @-@ 1926 ) , he first became noted as a collaborator of Ion G. Duca . In 1924 @-@ 1936 , in contrast to his post @-@ World War II agenda , Tătărescu was a noted anti @-@ communist , and reacted vehemently against the Romanian Communist Party ( <unk> , later PCR ) — recommending and obtaining its outlawing , based on Communist adversity to the concept of Greater Romania , and notably arguing that the Comintern @-@ supported <unk> Uprising was evidence of " imperialist communism " . 
 = = First cabinet = = 
 = = = Context = = = 
 Tătărescu became leader of the cabinet in January 1934 , as the fascist Iron Guard had assassinated Prime Minister Duca on 30 December 1933 ( the five @-@ day premiership of Constantin Anghelescu ensured transition between the two governments ) . His was the second PNL cabinet formed during Carol 's reign , and the latter 's failure to draw support from the mainstream group led to a tight connection being established between Carol and the young liberals , with Tătărescu backing the process leading to the creation of a royal dictatorship . One of Tătărescu 's first measures was a decisive move to end the conflict between the National Liberal executive and the Mayor of Bucharest , Dem I. Dobrescu ( who was backed by the National Peasants ' Party ) — making use of his prerogative , he removed Dobrescu from office on 18 January . 
 The brief period constituted a reference point in Romanian economy , as the emergence from the Great Depression , although marked by endemic problems , saw prosperity more widespread than ever before . This was , in part , the contribution of new economic relations which Tătărescu defended and encouraged : the state transformed itself into the main agent of economic activities , allowing for prosperous businesses to benefit from its demands , and , in time , leading to the creation of a <unk> dominated by the figures of industrialists such as Aristide Blank , Nicolae <unk> , and Max <unk> . In this context , Tătărescu 's allegedly subservient position in front of Carol was a frequent topic of ridicule at the time . According to a hostile account of the socialist Petre Pandrea : 
 " Tătărescu was ceremonious in order to cover his menial nature . When he was leaving audiences [ with the King ] , he pressed forward on the small of his back and returned facing backwards from the desk to the door , not daring to show his back . [ ... ] Watching over the scene [ ... ] , Carol II exclaimed to his intimate assistants : 
 — I don 't have a big enough <unk> for all the politicians to kiss ! " 
 Among other services rendered , he intervened in the conflict between Carol and his brother , Prince Nicholas , asking the latter to renounce either his marriage to Ioana <unk> @-@ Doletti — considered a <unk> by Carol , it had not been recognized by Romanian authorities — or his princely prerogatives . Nicholas chose the latter alternative in 1937 . 
 Inside his party , Tătărescu lost ground to Dinu Brătianu , elected by the traditional Liberal elite as a compromise in order to ensure unity ; upon his election in 1934 , the latter stated : 
 " This time as well , I would have gladly conceded , if I were to believe that anyone else in the party could gather voter unanimity . " 
 The issue remained debated for the following two years . The party congress of July 1936 eventually elected Tătărescu to the second position in the party , that of general secretary . 
 = = = European politics = = = 
 In his foreign policy , Prime Minister Tătărescu balanced two different priorities , attempting to strengthen the traditional military alliance with Poland which was aimed at the Soviet Union , and reacting against the growing regional influence of Nazi Germany by maintaining the relevancy of the Little Entente and establishing further contacts with the Soviets . 
 In August 1936 , he removed Nicolae Titulescu from the office of Foreign Minister , replacing him with Victor Antonescu . This caused an uproar , with most of Romania 's diplomatic corps voicing their dissatisfaction . Over the following months , virtually all of Titulescu 's supporters were themselves recalled ( including , among others , Constantin <unk> , the ambassador to Poland , Constantin <unk> , Romania 's representative to the League of Nations , Dimitrie <unk> , the ambassador to Belgium , and Caius <unk> , the ambassador to Austria ) while Titulescu 's adversaries , such as Antoine Bibesco , were returned to office . Bibesco subsequently campaigned in France and the United Kingdom , in an attempt to reassure Romania 's main allies that the move did not signify a change in Romania 's priorities . Tătărescu was later blamed by his own party for having renounced the diplomatic course on which Romania had engaged . 
 In early 1937 , Tătărescu rejected the proposal of Józef Beck , Poland 's Minister of Foreign Affairs , to withdraw Romania 's support for Czechoslovakia and attempt a reconciliation with Hungary ( the following year , Romania withdrew its support for the former , indicating , just before the Munich Agreement , that it was not in a position to guarantee Czechoslovakia 's frontiers ) . This was accompanied by Czechoslovak initiatives to establish close contacts between the Little Entente and the Soviets : a scandal erupted in the same year , when the country 's ambassador to Romania , Jan <unk> , published a volume calling for Soviet @-@ Entente military cooperation ( despite the Soviet @-@ Romanian conflict over Bessarabia ) and expressing the hope that the Soviet state would extend its borders into West Belarus and Ukraine . Kamil <unk> , Czechoslovakia 's Foreign Minister , received criticism for having prefaced the book , and , after Tătărescu paid a visit to Czechoslovak Prime Minister Milan <unk> , <unk> was recalled to Prague . 
 = = = Facing the Iron Guard = = = 
 In combating the Iron Guard , Tătărescu chose to relax virtually all pressures on the latter ( while mimicking some of its messages ) , and instead concentrated again on curbing the activities of the Romanian Communist Party ( PCR ) and outlawing its Popular Front @-@ type organizations ( see <unk> <unk> ) . 
 In April 1936 , he and the Minister of the Interior Ion <unk> allowed the a youth congress to gather in Târgu Mureș , aware of the fact that it was masking a fascist gathering ; delegates to the congress , traveling in a special train commissioned by the government , vandalized Ion Duca 's memorial plate in Sinaia train station , and , upon their arrival in Târgu Mureș , made public their violent anti @-@ Semitic agenda . It was probably there that death squads were designated and assigned missions , leading to the murder of Mihai <unk> , a former associate , in June of the next year . 
 In February 1937 , an intense publicity campaign by the Guard , begun with the ostentatious funerals of Ion Moța and Vasile Marin ( killed in the Spanish Civil War ) and culminating in the physical assaulting of Traian <unk> , rector of the University of Iași , by <unk> students , provoked the premier 's order to close down universities throughout the country . 
 Later in that year , the collaboration between monarch and premier , coupled with the fact that Tătărescu had successfully attracted nationalist votes from the Iron Guard , led to the signing of an electoral agreement between the latter , the National Peasants ' Party ( the main democratic opposition group ) , and the National Liberal Party @-@ Brătianu — the pact was meant to prevent all attempt by Carol to manipulate the votes in elections . ( A secondary and unexpected development was that the illegal PCR , which had decided to back the National Peasants ' Party prior to the elections , eventually supported the electoral pact . ) Tătărescu 's own alliance policy rose the anger of his opponents inside the PNL , as he signed collaboration agreements with the fascist Romanian Front and German Party . 
 The 1937 elections led to an unprecedented situation : although the PNL and Tătărescu had gained the largest percentage of the vote ( almost 36 % ) , they fell short of being awarded majority bonus ( granted at 40 % of the vote ) . As the far right had gathered momentum ( the Guard , running under the name of " Everything for the Fatherland Party " , had obtained 15 @.@ 6 % of the vote ) , Carol was faced with the threat of an Iron Guard government , which would have been one deeply opposed to all of his political principles : he called on a third party , Octavian Goga 's National Christian Party ( coming from the anti @-@ Semitic far right but deeply opposed to the Guard ) to form a new cabinet in December of that year . 
 Consequently , Tătărescu renounced his offices inside the party , and , while keeping his office of general secretary , he was surpassed by the readmitted Gheorghe I. Brătianu — who was elected to the new office of PNL vice president on 10 January 1938 . After the failure of Goga 's policies to curb the rise of their competitors , the king , backed by Tătărescu , resorted to dissolving all political parties on 30 May 1938 , creating instead the National Renaissance Front . 
 = = Second cabinet = = 
 In this context , Tătărescu chose to back the regime , as the PNL , like the National Peasants ' Party , remained active in nominal <unk> ( as the law banning it had never been enforced any further ) . Having personally signed the document banning opposition parties , he was expelled from the PNL in April 1938 , and contested the legitimacy of the action for the following years . Allegedly , his ousting was recommended by Iuliu Maniu , leader of the National Peasants ' Party 's and , for the following years , the closest of Dinu Brătianu 's political allies . 
 Soon after his second arrival to power , Tătărescu became noted for the enthusiastic support he gave to the modernist sculptor Constantin Brâncuși , and directed state funds to finance the building of Brâncuși 's The Endless Column complex in Târgu Jiu ( completed in October 1938 ) . 
 Alongside Alexandru Vaida @-@ Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu ( whom he succeeded as Premier ) , Tătărescu became a dominant figure in the group of maverick pro @-@ Carol politicians . After a bloody crackdown on the Iron Guard , the Front attempted to reunite political forces in a national government that was to back Carol 's foreign policies in view of increasing threats on Romania 's borders after the outbreak of World War II . In 1945 , Tătărescu stressed his belief that authoritarianism benefited Romania , and supported the view that Carol had meant to keep Romania out of the war . Tătărescu 's second cabinet was meant to reflect the latter policies , but it did not draw any support from traditional parties , and , in April 1940 , Carol , assisted by Ernest <unk> and Mihail <unk> , began talks with the ( by then much weaker ) Iron Guard . 
 Tătărescu remained in office throughout the rest of the Phony War , until the fall of France , and his cabinet signed an economic agreement with Nazi Germany ( through which virtually all Romanian exports were directed towards the latter country ) and saw the crumbling of Romania 's alliance with the United Kingdom and France . The cabinet was brought down by the cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union ( effects of the Molotov @-@ Ribbentrop Pact ) , as well as by Carol 's attempt to appease German hostility by dissolving it , replacing Tătărescu with Ion <unk> , and recreating the Front as the totalitarian Party of the Nation . 
 = = World War = = 
 After the Second Vienna Award ( when Northern Transylvania was lost to Hungary ) , confirming Carol 's failure to preserve both the country 's neutrality and its territorial integrity , Romania was taken over by an Iron Guard dictatorial government ( the National Legionary State ) . Speaking five years later , Dinu Brătianu placed the blame for the serious developments on Tătărescu 's own actions , addressing him directly : 
 " I remind you : [ ... ] you have contributed directly , in 1940 , in steering the country towards a foreign policy that , as one could tell even then , was to prove ill @-@ fated and which led us to the loathsome Vienna settlement , one which you have supported inside the Crown Council [ ... ] . " 
 On 26 November 1940 , the Iron Guard began a bloody retaliation against various political figures who had served under Carol ( following a late investigation into the 1938 killing of Corneliu <unk> Codreanu , the movement 's founder and early leader , by Carol 's authorities ) . Tătărescu and Constantin Argetoianu were among the second wave of captured politicians ( on 27 November ) , and were destined for arbitrary execution ; they were , however , saved by the intervention of regular police forces , most of whom had grown hostile to the <unk> militias . 
 Retired from political life during the war , he was initially sympathetic to Ion Antonescu 's pro @-@ German dictatorship ( see Romania during World War II ) — Dinu Brătianu , who remained in opposition to the Antonescu regime , made mention an official visit to Bessarabia , recovered after the start of Operation Barbarossa , when Tătărescu had accompanied Antonescu , " thus making common cause with his warmongering action " . At the time , his daughter Sandra Tătărescu Negropontes worked as an ambulance driver for the Romanian Red Cross . 
 In the end , Tătărescu became involved in negotiations aimed at withdrawing Romania from the conflict , and , while beginning talks with the Romanian Communist Party ( PCR ) , tried to build foreign connections to support Romania 's cause following the inevitable defeat ; he thus corresponded with Edvard Beneš , leader of the Czechoslovak government in exile in England . Beneš , who had already been discussing matters involving Romania with Richard <unk> and Grigore <unk> , and had agreed to support the Romanian cause , informed the Allied governments of Tătărescu 's designs . 
 Tătărescu later contrasted his diplomatic approach with the strategy of Barbu Știrbey ( who had only attempted an agreement with the Western Allies in Cairo , instead of opening relations with the Soviets ) . Initially meeting with the refusal of Iuliu Maniu and Dinu Brătianu ( who decided to invest their trust in Știrbey ) , he was relatively successful after the Cairo initiative proved fruitless : the two traditional parties accepted collaboration with the bloc formed by the PCR , the Romanian Social Democratic Party , the <unk> 's Front , and the Socialist Peasants ' Party , leading to the formation of the short @-@ lived and unstable National Democratic Bloc ( BND ) in June 1944 . It overthrew Antonescu in August , by means of the successful King Michael Coup . 
 = = Alliance with the Communists = = 
 Tătărescu returned to the PNL later in 1944 — after the Soviet Red Army had entered Romania and the country had become an Allied state , political parties were again allowed to register . Nevertheless , Tătărescu was again opposed to the party leaders Dinu and Gheorghe I. Brătianu , and split to form his own group in June – July 1945 . Dinu Brătianu convened the PNL leadership and formally excluded Tătărescu and his partisans , citing their support for dictatorial regimes . 
 As the PCR , which was growing more influential ( with the backing of Soviet occupation ) while generally lacking popular appeal , sought to form alliances with various forces in order to increase its backing , Tătărescu declared his group to be left @-@ wing and Social liberal , while attempting to preserve a middle course in the new political setting , by pleading for close relations to be maintained with both the Soviet Union and the Western Allies . N. D. Cocea , a prominent socialist who had joined the PNL , represented the faction in talks for an alliance with the Communists . The agreement , favored by Ana Pauker , was vehemently opposed by another member of the Communist leadership , Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu , who argued in favor of " making a distinction inside the bourgeoisie " , and collaborating with the main PNL , while calling Tătărescu 's faction " a gang of con artists , blackmailers , and well @-@ known <unk> " . 
 Tătărescu became Foreign Minister and vice president of the government in the cabinet of Petru Groza when the latter came into office after Soviet pressures in 1945 ; his faction had been awarded leadership of four other ministries — Finance , with three successive office @-@ holders ( of whom the last was Alexandru <unk> ) , Public Works , with Gheorghe <unk> , Industry ( with Petre N. Bejan ) , and Religious Affairs , with Radu <unk> . He indirectly helped the PCR carry out an electoral fraud during the general election in 1946 by failing to reply to American proposals for organizing fair elections . At the Paris Conference , where he was accompanied by the PCR leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu @-@ Dej and Pătrășcanu , he acknowledged the dissolution of Greater Romania under the provisions of the new Treaty ( 1947 ) . 
 = = 1947 and after = = 
 Tensions between his group with the PCR occurred when the former founded itself as a party under the name of National @-@ Liberal Party ( commonly known as the National Liberal Party @-@ Tătărescu ) , and , in June – July 1945 , proclaimed its goal to be the preservation of property and a middle class under a new regime . Of himself and his principles , Tătărescu stated : 
 " I am not a communist . Taking in view my attitudes towards mankind , society , property , I am not a communist . Thus , the new orientation in external politics which I demand for my country cannot be accused of being determined by affinities or sympathies of doctrine . " 
 Speaking in retrospect , Gheorghiu @-@ Dej indicated the actual relation between his party and Tătărescu 's : " we have had to tolerate by our side a capitalist @-@ gentry political group , Tătărescu 's group " . 
 Tătărescu himself continued to show his support for several PCR policies : in the summer of 1947 , he condemned the United States for having protested against the repression of forces in the opposition . Nevertheless , at around the same time , he issued his own critique of the Groza government , becoming the target of violent attacks initiated by Miron Constantinescu in the PCR press . Consequently , he was singled out for negligence in office when , during the kangaroo trial of Iuliu Maniu ( see <unk> Affair ) , it was alleged that several employees of his ministry had conspired against the government . Scînteia , the official voice of the PCR , wrote of all National Liberal Party @-@ Tătărescu offices in the government : " The rot is all @-@ encompassing ! It has to be removed ! " . 
 Tătărescu resigned his office on 6 November 1947 , and was replaced by the Communist Ana Pauker . For the following two months , he was sidelined in his own party by PCR pressures , and removed from its leadership in January 1948 ( being replaced with Petre N. Bejan — the party was subsequently known as National Liberal Party @-@ Petre N. Bejan ) . One of his last actions as cabinet member had been to sign the document officially rejecting the Marshall Plan . 
 After the proclamation of the People 's Republic of Romania on 30 December 1947 , the existence of all parties other than the PCR had become purely formal , and , after the elections of 28 March the one @-@ party state was confirmed by legislation . He was arrested on 5 May 1950 , and held in the notorious Sighet prison ( alongside three of his brothers — Ștefan Tătărescu included — and his former collaborator Bejan ) . His son Tudor , who was living in Paris , suffered from schizophrenia after 1950 , and had to be committed to an institution ( where he died in 1955 ) . Sandra Tătărescu Negropontes was also imprisoned in 1950 , and released three years later , upon the death of Joseph Stalin . 
 One of Gheorghe Tătărescu 's last appearances in public was his stand as one of the prosecution 's witnesses in the 1954 trial of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu , when he claimed that the defendant had been infiltrated into the PCR during the time when he had been premier ( Pătrășcanu was posthumously cleared of all charges ) . Released in 1955 , Tătărescu died in Bucharest , less than two years later . According to Sanda Tătărescu Negropontes , this came as a result of tuberculosis contracted while in detention .

 In July 2004 , Spears announced her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline , whom she had met three months before . The romance received intense attention from the media , since Federline had recently broken up with actress Shar Jackson , who was still pregnant with their second child at the time . The initial stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears 's first reality show Britney & Kevin : Chaotic . They held a wedding ceremony on September 18 , 2004 , but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple 's prenuptial agreement . In October 2004 , the singer announced she would be taking another career break to start a family . Spears gave birth to her first child , Sean Preston Federline , on September 14 , 2005 . 
 " Someday ( I Will Understand ) " was composed by Spears on the piano at her house , two weeks before she learned of her pregnancy with Sean Preston . She explained the song came " like a prophecy ... when you 're pregnant , you 're empowered " . It was produced by Guy Sigsworth , who previously worked with the singer on " Everytime " ( 2003 ) . Spears recorded her vocals for the song at Conway Studios in Los Angeles , California , and at Frou Frou Central in London . The piano was played by Spears herself , while all other instruments and mixing were done by Sigsworth . Background vocals for the song were provided by Kate Havnevik .

 Willie Landry Mount ( born August 25 , 1949 ) is an American politician from Louisiana who served as a Democratic member of the Louisiana State Senate from 2000 to 2012 . She represented District 27 , which includes parts of Lake Charles and the surrounding cities of Sulphur and Westlake . From 1993 to 1999 , Mount was the first female to have served as the mayor of Lake Charles . 
 Mount was a candidate in the 2004 U.S. House of Representatives election for Louisiana 's 7th congressional district . She was defeated by Republican Charles Boustany in a contested general election campaign that received national attention . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Born and reared in Lake Charles , Mount in 1974 obtained a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from McNeese State University in Lake Charles . She owned a small business and worked as a real estate agent and pharmaceutical representative for Lederle Laboratories . Mount resides in her hometown with her husband , attorney Benjamin Mount ; they have no children . 
 = = Career = = 
 Mount had been active in community work , through organizations such as the Junior League of Lake Charles , and ran for mayor of Lake Charles in 1993 , winning against Paul Savoie , a Democrat and a former mayor . During her tenure she served as president of the Louisiana Conference of Mayors and supported restoration efforts following hurricanes . To this end Mount testified before Congress in support of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999 . She also co @-@ sponsored the building of an Amtrak station , modeled after an older station that had been destroyed in a fire . In an effort to succeed retiring state senator James J. Cox , Mount announced her senate candidacy on October 19 , 1999 , while addressing the Calcasieu Parish School Board , which she asked to support her . Upon being elected , Mount resigned as mayor and City Council President Rodney <unk> took over the office . 
 In the senate , Mount served on a variety of committees , chairing the Senate Committees on Coastal Restoration and Flood Control , Revenue and Fiscal Affairs , and also serving as Vice @-@ Chair of the Senate Committee on Education . In 2008 , she became chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare . Mount often sponsors legislation regarding health and public service . This includes bills intended to identify sex offenders and enact term limits for various boards and commissions . She was responsible for passing these term limits as an amendment to the Louisiana Constitution , as SB 232 on November 4 , 2008 . Mount also sponsored legislation to merge New Orleans criminal and civil district courts , create a childhood and family learning center , couple the opening of new hospice care providers with inspections of existing ones , allow police to suspend driver 's licenses of teenagers with problems at school , and create a state @-@ run internet database providing information on the quality of health care providers . Mount was responsible for legislation that made Louisiana water fluoridation mandatory , and , in her capacity as chair of the Senate Health committee , Mount in 2008 declared major Louisiana health care reform unlikely without prior federal reform . 
 As senator , Mount raised funds for health care facilities ( Mount had herself roasted in support of the Southwest Louisiana Center for Health Services ) . Mount is a member of a number of boards and charitable organisations and provides an annual compilation of " Louisiana positives " about Louisiana 's standing in national ratings . Due to term limits , Mount was eligible to serve as senator until 2012 . 
 = = 2004 Congressional race = = 
 Mount ran for Congress in 2004 to succeed Chris John , who had announced his retirement from the U.S. House of Representatives to run for the U.S. Senate . She positioned herself as a conservative Democrat , supportive of balanced budgets and conservative social views , emphasizing job creation , health care and her opposition to offshoring . Her major Democratic opponent in the jungle primary was African American State Senator Don Cravins , Sr. , the father of another lawmaker , Don Cravins , Jr . , of Opelousas . Her major Republican opponent was Charles Boustany , a retired heart surgeon from Lafayette , who ran on a platform of preventing tax increases and passing a new energy bill . The Louisiana Democratic Party was supporting Mount , as Cravins was believed to be a weaker contestant in a run @-@ off . Polls taken in late October had shown Boustany , Cravins and Mount statistically tied and the election was hotly contested . 
 In the first ballot on November 2 , 2004 , Boustany and Mount garnered the most votes ; Cravins was defeated by less than two thousand votes . As both fell short of a majority , a second ballot was mandated . In the subsequent campaign , Mount criticized Boustany for favouring tax cuts for the rich and being indifferent to health care , while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents . Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases . Mount also criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security , an unpopular position in Louisiana , and as removed from the interests of voters . She received endorsements by U.S. Senator John Breaux , who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years , and governor Kathleen Blanco . Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney , who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles . Mount , however , was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins , who complained about the state Democratic Party 's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss . Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act . 
 In the general election on December 4 , 2004 , Boustany defeated Mount , 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with low voter turnout . Democrats had hoped on a big turnout , as the district is nearly a quarter African American , a reliable Democratic constituency . Analysis of the race suggested that Mount 's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had the Democratic candidates work against each other and led to <unk> 's conflict with the state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter turnout . The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout . Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the strong support for George W. Bush in the presidential election in the district , which he carried by about 60 percent . Following her defeat , Mount ruled out another campaign for the seat , but not a campaign for another state @-@ wide office . 
 When Mount left the Senate in 2012 , she was succeeded by a Republican , former State Representative Ronnie Johns of Sulphur , who ran unopposed for the open seat .

 No. 36 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) strategic transport squadron . It operates Boeing C @-@ 17 Globemaster III heavy airlifters from RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland . The squadron has seen active service flying transport aircraft during World War II , the Korean War , the Indonesia – Malaysia Konfrontasi , the Vietnam War , and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . It has also supported Australian humanitarian and peacekeeping operations around the world , including Somalia , Cambodia , East Timor and Indonesia . 
 The squadron was formed at RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria , in March 1942 , and equipped with Douglas DC @-@ 2s , among other aircraft . Later in the war it began operating Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas . From 1946 to 1953 it was controlled by No. 86 ( Transport ) Wing , which was based in New South Wales at RAAF Station Schofields and , later , RAAF Station Richmond . In 1953 it was re @-@ formed at Iwakuni , Japan , as part of No. 91 ( Composite ) Wing . It returned to Australia and the aegis of No. 86 Wing in 1955 . The squadron began re @-@ equipping with Lockheed C @-@ 130 Hercules at Richmond in 1958 , becoming the first non @-@ US operator of the type . Over the next half @-@ century it flew two models of Hercules , the C @-@ 130A and C @-@ 130H . The squadron transferred to Amberley in 2006 , when it took delivery of its first Globemaster .

 No. 36 Squadron is responsible for strategic air transport in Australia and overseas , conducting missions as part of military operations and humanitarian efforts . It is located at RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland , and controlled by No. 86 Wing , which is part of Air Mobility Group . The unit headquarters comprises executive , administrative and operational components . As well as aircrew , the squadron is staffed by maintenance personnel responsible for regular servicing of equipment ; they are frequently required to accompany the aircraft on deployments overseas . More complex servicing is conducted by Boeing . No. 36 Squadron 's official crest , approved in May 1966 , depicts a horse intended to symbolise strength , speed , mobility and dependability . The unit 's motto is " Sure " . 
 The squadron operates eight Boeing C @-@ 17 Globemaster IIIs , the first of which entered service in December 2006 . The eighth and last was delivered in November 2015 . The aircraft are generally crewed by two pilots and a loadmaster , the latter being responsible for the loading , carriage and unloading of cargo or passengers . The C @-@ 17 can carry 70 tonnes of equipment , and is large enough to accommodate helicopters , tanks and other military vehicles . It can also carry over 130 passengers , and is designed for aerial despatch of paratroops or cargo . The C @-@ 17 has a range of some 10 @,@ 000 km ( 6 @,@ 200 miles ) and is able to operate from short and unsealed airstrips . Flown with a joystick and fly @-@ by @-@ wire controls , the aircraft is also highly manoeuvrable and responsive considering its size . It can be refuelled in flight by the Airbus KC @-@ 30A Multi Role Tanker Transports operated by No. 33 Squadron .

 During February and March 1942 , the RAAF formed four transport units : Nos. 33 , 34 , 35 and 36 Squadrons . No. 36 Squadron was established on 11 March at RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria , under the control of Southern Area Command . Its initial strength was twenty @-@ six personnel and one Douglas DC @-@ 2 . This was gradually built up to a force of six DC @-@ 2s , as well as examples of various de Havilland types including the DH.84 Dragon , DH.86 Express , DH.89 Dragon Rapide , and Tiger Moth . Tasked with transport operations throughout Australia and to Port Moresby , New Guinea , the squadron relocated to Essendon , Victoria , on 17 July . One of the DC @-@ 2s crashed at Seven Mile Aerodrome , Port Moresby , on 14 September ; all aboard were killed . The squadron was transferred to Townsville , Queensland , on 11 December 1942 . During 1943 , it maintained detachments at Essendon and in New Guinea , and began re @-@ equipping with twelve Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas . 
 On 27 March 1943 , a Dakota of No. 36 Squadron crashed on takeoff in pre @-@ dawn fog at RAAF Station Archerfield , killing all twenty @-@ three occupants , twenty of whom were RAAF or Women 's Auxiliary Australian Air Force personnel . The squadron relocated to Garbutt on 20 February 1944 . During the New Guinea campaign it was responsible for carrying troops and cargo , and undertaking courier runs and supply drops . In 1945 , a detachment of No. 36 Squadron Dakotas augmented No. 84 Wing 's operations in Bougainville , flying almost 800 sorties between January and June . The squadron lost two Dakotas on supply missions in Aitape during February 1945 . In August , it flew paratroopers into Singapore as part of the reoccupation of the city , after which it continued to transport troops and cargo , and repatriate prisoners of war . Following the end of hostilities , in March 1946 , a detachment of six Dakotas established a courier service between Morotai and Japan , where Australian units had joined the British Commonwealth Occupation Force .

 On 19 August 1946 , No. 36 Squadron transferred to RAAF Station Schofields , New South Wales , where it came under the control of No. 86 ( Transport ) Wing along with Nos. 37 and 38 Squadrons , also operating Dakotas , and No. 486 ( Maintenance ) Squadron . No. 486 Squadron provided day @-@ to @-@ day servicing for each of the flying squadrons , deeper maintenance being handled by No. 2 Aircraft Depot , based at the nearby RAAF Station Richmond . Courier flights to Japan continued until December 1947 , a 21 @,@ 000 km ( 13 @,@ 000 @-@ mile ) round trip from Schofields . On 25 August 1948 , twenty staff from No. 36 Squadron joined five crews from No. 38 Squadron to take part in the Berlin Airlift , a commitment that lasted almost a year . The Australians delivered over 16 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 pounds ( 7 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 kg ) of supplies , and over 7 @,@ 000 passengers . In the absence of these crews , Nos. 36 and 38 Squadron operations were amalgamated , flying hours being recorded under the latter 's auspices . During June 1949 , No. 36 Squadron and the other extant components of No. 86 Wing , Nos. 38 and 486 Squadrons , relocated from Schofields to Richmond . 
 Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons began to operate separately again in June 1950 , following the return of crews from Berlin and No. 38 Squadron 's departure for service in the Malayan Emergency . No. 36 Squadron assumed control of the Governor @-@ General 's Flight in October 1950 . On 21 November 1952 , the squadron was awarded the Duke of Gloucester Cup for its proficiency . The return of No. 38 Squadron from Malaya in December stripped No. 36 Squadron of crews to ensure an even distribution of personnel among the two units . This led to No. 36 Squadron again merging with No. 38 Squadron . The former disbanded at Richmond on 9 March 1953 , re @-@ forming the next day from No. 30 Transport Unit at Iwakuni , Japan . Here it was part of No. 91 ( Composite ) Wing , which controlled the RAAF 's units during the Korean War and its immediate aftermath . Its complement included eight Dakotas and one CAC Wirraway . In July and August , the squadron evacuated over 900 Commonwealth prisoners of war . It departed Japan on 13 March 1955 , having carried over 42 @,@ 000 passengers and 6 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 pounds ( 2 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 kg ) of cargo , and was re @-@ established on 1 May at RAAF Base Canberra , where No. 86 Wing had transferred the previous year .

 No. 36 Squadron handed over its six Dakotas to No. 38 Squadron in July 1958 , prior to re @-@ equipping with the Lockheed C @-@ 130 Hercules . It returned to Richmond in August , followed by the rest of No. 86 Wing a month later . After conversion training of its personnel in the United States , No. 36 Squadron became the first non @-@ US operator of the Hercules in December 1958 , when it began taking delivery of twelve C @-@ 130As ; deliveries completed in March 1959 . The official history of the post @-@ war Air Force described the Hercules as " probably the biggest step @-@ up in aircraft capabilities " the RAAF had ever received , considering it roughly four times as effective as the Dakota , taking into account the improvements in payload , range , and speed . In September 1960 , No. 36 Squadron began parachute trials on the Hercules . It made the Hercules ' first troop @-@ carrying flights into a combat zone in December 1962 , joining a Commonwealth airlift from Singapore to Borneo at the onset of the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia ; similar missions were undertaken over the next five years . The squadron was again awarded the Gloucester Cup in 1963 . 
 In August 1964 , No. 36 Squadron became an independently operating unit under the command of Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond , following the disbandment of No. 86 Wing . No. 486 Squadron was disbanded at the same time , leaving No. 36 Squadron responsible for its own day @-@ to @-@ day maintenance until 1966 ; No. 486 Squadron was re @-@ formed that year to service both No. 36 Squadron and No. 37 Squadron , the latter having taken delivery of twelve C @-@ 130E Hercules . During the Vietnam War , both squadrons undertook long @-@ range transport and medical evacuation flights between Australia and South East Asia , servicing Phan Rang , Vung Tau , and Nui Dat . No. 36 Squadron was presented with its own standard by Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , on 1 April 1971 , in recognition of a quarter @-@ century 's service . Eight of its twelve Hercules were involved in relief efforts after Cyclone Tracy struck Darwin , Northern Territory , on Christmas Eve 1974 ; the aircraft flew over 550 hours , carrying 2 @,@ 864 passengers and almost 800 @,@ 000 pounds ( 360 @,@ 000 kg ) of cargo . Having remained in service for twenty years , clocking up 147 @,@ 000 accident @-@ free flying hours , the C @-@ 130As were replaced by C @-@ 130Hs in 1978 . 
 In November 1978 , one of No. 36 Squadron 's C @-@ 130Hs became the first Australian Hercules to land in Antarctica , at McMurdo Sound . The squadron reached a total of 200 @,@ 000 accident @-@ free flying hours in C @-@ 130s during 1984 . When No. 86 Wing was re @-@ formed at Richmond on 2 February 1987 , under the newly established Air Lift Group ( later Air Mobility Group ) , No. 36 Squadron formed part of its complement . The unit again received the Gloucester Cup in 1989 . That year , it provided transport for civilian passengers during the pilots ' dispute that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines ; three aircraft and five crews undertook this task , over and above their normal duties . The squadron reached 100 @,@ 000 accident @-@ free flying hours on the C @-@ 130H during 1990 . In December 1990 and January 1991 , it flew missions to Dubai in support of Australia 's naval contribution to the Gulf War , and in 1993 transported Australian troops to Somalia as part of Operation Solace . Four of its C @-@ 130Hs were equipped with Electronic Warfare Self Protection packs , including radar and missile warning systems , and countermeasures such as chaff and flares , in 1994 . Later in the decade , one of the C @-@ 130Hs was fitted with signals intelligence equipment and crewed by RAAF and Defence Signals Directorate personnel . 
 Six of No. 36 Squadron 's Hercules evacuated over 450 civilians from Cambodia following the coup in July 1997 . The unit again became responsible for its own routine maintenance in 1998 , when No. 486 Squadron was disbanded . A detachment from No. 36 Squadron supported INTERFET operations in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000 . The squadron was assigned four C @-@ 130Es previously operated by No. 37 Squadron during the latter 's transition to the new C @-@ 130J Super Hercules , which commenced in 1999 ; the E models were retired the following year . No. 36 Squadron was once more awarded the Gloucester Cup in 2001 . It took part in relief efforts following the Bali Bombings in October 2002 . In February 2003 , it deployed a detachment of two Hercules to the Middle East as part of the Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq . The aircraft arrived on 10 February , and began flying transport sorties less than two weeks later . A No. 36 Squadron Hercules became the first Coalition aircraft to land at Al Asad Airbase , west of Baghdad , after it was secured by Australian special forces personnel . One aircraft was hit by ground fire near Baghdad on 27 June 2004 , killing a coalition passenger . The detachment remained in Iraq until September 2004 , when it was relieved by two C @-@ 130Js from No. 37 Squadron . No. 36 Squadron also participated in Operation Sumatra Assist in the wake of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami . 
 = = = Globemaster era = = = 
 In May 2006 , No. 36 Squadron personnel began conversion training in the US in preparation for re @-@ equipping with Boeing C @-@ 17 Globemaster III heavy transports . It transferred its C @-@ 130Hs to No. 37 Squadron on 17 November 2006 , prior to relocating to Amberley . Also on 17 November , Wing Commander Linda Corbould took command of the unit , becoming the first woman to lead an RAAF flying squadron . Corbould was responsible for delivering the first Globemaster from the United States to Australia on 4 December . No. 36 Squadron achieved initial operating capability with the C @-@ 17 on 11 September 2007 , following eight months ' work @-@ up training . In June 2008 , it received the Gloucester Cup as the RAAF 's most proficient flying squadron of 2007 " for achieving all training objectives , supporting air lift activities globally and nationally and fulfilling short @-@ notice , high priority tasks , despite the squadron 's expertise being in its infancy " . Corbould completed her posting as commanding officer on 8 December 2008 , the day the squadron marked the second anniversary of C @-@ 17 operations by conducting the RAAF 's first flight with an all @-@ female aircrew . 
 Since re @-@ equipping with the Globemaster , No. 36 Squadron has continued to support Coalition forces in Afghanistan , as well as humanitarian operations worldwide . In 2011 , it took part in relief efforts following the floods in Queensland , the Christchurch earthquake , and the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan . The Queensland floods necessitated the evacuation of two C @-@ 17s to Richmond , when Amberley was threatened by rising waters ; of the other two Globemasters , one was in the Middle East and the other was undergoing maintenance at Amberley and could not be flown but was moved onto high ground and escaped damage . The deployment to Japan involved all three of the squadron 's available C @-@ 17s , the fourth still being serviced at Amberley . On 11 May 2012 , a C @-@ 17 flew an Australian Army M1 Abrams tank from RAAF Base Darwin to Shoalwater Bay for a training exercise ; it was the first time an RAAF Globemaster had airlifted an Abrams , which at 61 tonnes was among the largest single items the 70 @-@ tonne @-@ capacity aircraft could carry . In November that year the squadron took delivery of its sixth Globemaster . It was again awarded the Gloucester Cup in March 2013 , for its proficiency the previous year . 
 In September 2014 , RAAF C @-@ 17s were used to airlift arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish @-@ controlled northern Iraq following an offensive by ISIL militants . On 10 April 2015 , Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the purchase of two more C @-@ 17s , which would bring No. 36 Squadron 's complement to eight aircraft . Concurrent with delivery of the new C @-@ 17s by year 's end , No. 36 Squadron 's facilities were to be improved , obviating the need for maintenance to take place in No. 33 Squadron hangars . Also on 10 April , the squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup a record seventh time , and the RAAF 's Maintenance Trophy a record fourth time . Later the same month , an Airbus KC @-@ 30A Multi Role Tanker Transport of No. 33 Squadron carried out the RAAF 's first in @-@ flight refuelling of a No. 36 Squadron Globemaster . The Governor @-@ General , Sir Peter Cosgrove , presented the squadron with a new standard on 19 May ; the old standard was laid up in Holy Trinity Chapel at RAAF Williams , Victoria . No. 36 Squadron was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation in the Queen 's Birthday Honours on 13 June 2016 for " for sustained outstanding service in warlike operations throughout the Middle East Area of Operations over the period January 2002 to June 2014 " . 
 = Cucurbita = 
 Cucurbita ( Latin for gourd ) is a genus of herbaceous vines in the gourd family , Cucurbitaceae , also known as cucurbits , native to the Andes and Mesoamerica . Five species are grown worldwide for their edible fruit , variously known as squash , pumpkin , or gourd depending on species , variety , and local parlance , and for their seeds . First cultivated in the Americas before being brought to Europe by returning explorers after their discovery of the New World , plants in the genus Cucurbita are important sources of human food and oil . Other kinds of gourd , also called bottle @-@ gourds , are native to Africa and belong to the genus Lagenaria , which is in the same family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe . These other gourds are used as utensils or vessels , and their young fruits are eaten much like those of Cucurbita species . 
 Most Cucurbita species are herbaceous vines that grow several meters in length and have tendrils , but non @-@ <unk> " bush " cultivars of C. pepo and C. maxima have also been developed . The yellow or orange flowers on a Cucurbita plant are of two types : female and male . The female flowers produce the fruit and the male flowers produce pollen . Many North and Central American species are visited by specialist bee pollinators , but other insects with more general feeding habits , such as honey bees , also visit . 
 The fruits of the genus Cucurbita are good sources of nutrients , such as vitamin A and vitamin C , among other nutrients according to species . The plants contain the toxins , such as <unk> , <unk> , and cucurbitacin . 
 There is debate about the taxonomy of the genus , as the number of accepted species varies from 13 to 30 . The five domesticated species are Cucurbita argyrosperma , C. ficifolia , C. maxima , C. moschata , and C. pepo . All of these can be treated as winter squash because the full @-@ grown fruits can be stored for months ; however , C. pepo includes some cultivars that are better used only as summer squash . 
 Cucurbita fruits have played a role in human culture for at least 2 @,@ 000 years . They are often represented in Moche ceramics from Peru . After Christopher Columbus 's arrival in the New World , paintings of squashes started to appear in Europe early in the sixteenth century . The fruits have many culinary uses including pumpkin pie , biscuits , bread , desserts , puddings , beverages , and soups . Pumpkins and other Cucurbita fruits are celebrated in festivals and in flower and vegetable shows in many countries . 
 = = Description = = 
 Cucurbita species fall into two main groups . The first group are annual or short @-@ lived perennial vines and are mesophytic , i.e. they require a more or less continuous water supply . The second group are perennials growing in arid zones and so are xerophytic , tolerating dry conditions . Cultivated Cucurbita species were derived from the first group . Growing 5 to 15 meters ( 16 to 49 ft ) in height or length , the plant stem produces tendrils to help it climb adjacent plants and structures or extend along the ground . Most species do not readily root from the nodes ; a notable exception is C. ficifolia , and the four other cultivated <unk> do this to a lesser extent . The vine of the perennial Cucurbita can become <unk> if left to grow . There is wide variation in size , shape , and color among Cucurbita fruits , and even within a single species . C. ficifolia is an exception , being highly uniform in appearance . The morphological variation in the species C. pepo and C. maxima is so vast that its various subspecies and cultivars have been misidentified as totally separate species . 
 The typical cultivated Cucurbita species has five @-@ lobed or <unk> divided leaves with long petioles , with the leaves alternately arranged on the stem . The stems in some species are angular . All of the above @-@ ground parts may be hairy with various types of trichomes , which are often hardened and sharp . Spring @-@ like tendrils grow from each node and are branching in some species . C. argyrosperma has ovate @-@ cordate ( egg @-@ shaped to heart @-@ shaped ) leaves . The shape of C. pepo leaves varies widely . C. moschata plants can have light or dense pubescence . C. ficifolia leaves are slightly angular and have light pubescence . The leaves of all four of these species may or may not have white spots . 
 There are male ( staminate ) and female ( pistillate ) flowers ( unisexual flowers ) on a single plant ( monoecious ) , and these grow singly , appearing from the leaf axils . Flowers have five fused yellow to orange petals ( the corolla ) and a green bell @-@ shaped calyx . Male flowers in Cucurbitaceae generally have five stamens , but in Cucurbita there are only three , and their anthers are joined together so that there appears to be one . Female flowers have thick pedicels , and an inferior ovary with 3 – 5 stigmas that each have two lobes . The female flowers of C. argyrosperma and C. ficifolia have larger corollas than the male flowers . Female flowers of C. pepo have a small calyx , but the calyx of C. moschata male flowers is comparatively short . 
 Cucurbita fruits are large and fleshy . Botanists classify the Cucurbita fruit as a pepo , which is a special type of berry derived from an inferior ovary , with a thick outer wall or rind with <unk> tissue forming an <unk> around the ovary , and a fleshy interior composed of mesocarp and <unk> . The term " pepo " is used primarily for Cucurbitaceae fruits , where this fruit type is common , but the fruits of Passiflora and <unk> are sometimes also <unk> . The seeds , which are attached to the ovary wall ( parietal placentation ) and not to the center , are large and fairly flat with a large embryo that consists almost entirely of two cotyledons . Fruit size varies considerably : wild fruit specimens can be as small as 4 centimeters ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) and some domesticated specimens can weigh well over 300 kilograms ( 660 lb ) . The current world record was set in 2014 by Beni Meier of Switzerland with a 2 @,@ 323 @.@ 7 @-@ pound ( 1 @,@ 054 @.@ 0 kg ) pumpkin . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Cucurbita was formally described in a way that meets the requirements of modern botanical nomenclature by Linnaeus in his Genera Plantarum , the fifth edition of 1754 in conjunction with the 1753 first edition of Species Plantarum . Cucurbita pepo is the type species of the genus . Linnaeus initially included the species C. pepo , C. verrucosa and C. <unk> ( both now included in C. pepo ) , as well as C. <unk> ( watermelon , now Citrullus lanatus ) and C. lagenaria ( now Lagenaria <unk> ) ( both are not Cucurbita but are in the family Cucurbitaceae . 
 The Cucurbita digitata , C. foetidissima , C. <unk> , and C. pedatifolia species groups are <unk> , arid zone perennials with storage roots ; the remainder , including the five domesticated species , are all mesophytic annuals or short @-@ life perennials with no storage roots . The five domesticated species are mostly isolated from each other by sterility barriers and have different physiological characteristics . Some cross <unk> can occur : C. pepo with C. argyrosperma and C. moschata ; and C. maxima with C. moschata . Cross pollination does occur readily within the family Cucurbitaceae . The buffalo gourd ( C. foetidissima ) , which does not taste good , has been used as an intermediary as it can be crossed with all the common Cucurbita . 
 Various taxonomic treatments have been proposed for Cucurbita , ranging from 13 – 30 species . In 1990 , Cucurbita expert Michael Nee classified them into the following oft @-@ cited 13 species groups ( 27 species total ) , listed by group and alphabetically , with geographic origin : 
 C. argyrosperma ( synonym C. mixta ) – <unk> pumpkin ; origin : Panama , Mexico 
 C. <unk> , origin : Pacific coast of western Mexico 
 C. palmeri , origin : Pacific coast of northwestern Mexico 
 C. sororia , origin : Pacific coast Mexico to Nicaragua , northeastern Mexico 
 C. digitata – <unk> gourd ; origin : southwestern United States ( USA ) , northwestern Mexico 
 C. californica 
 C. cordata 
 C. <unk> 
 C. palmata 
 C. <unk> , origin : Ecuador 's Pacific coast 
 C. ficifolia – <unk> gourd , <unk> ; origin : Mexico , Panama , northern Chile and Argentina 
 C. foetidissima – stinking gourd , buffalo gourd ; origin : Mexico 
 C. <unk> , likely a natural hybrid of C. foetidissima and C. pedatifolia 
 C. <unk> is little known ; origin : Oaxaca , Mexico 
 C. <unk> , origin : Mexico , Guatemala , Belize 
 C. maxima – winter squash , pumpkin ; origin : Argentina , Bolivia , Ecuador 
 C. <unk> , origin – Argentina 
 C. moschata – butternut squash , ' Dickinson ' pumpkin , golden <unk> ; origin : Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Mexico , Panama , Puerto Rico , Venezuela 
 C. <unk> , origin : Florida 
 C. <unk> , origin : Mexican Gulf Coast and foothills 
 C. pedatifolia , origin : Querétaro , Mexico 
 C. moorei 
 C. pepo – field pumpkin , summer squash , zucchini , vegetable marrow , courgette , acorn squash ; origin : Mexico , USA 
 C. fraterna , origin : Tamaulipas and Nuevo León , Mexico 
 C. texana , origin : Texas , USA 
 C. radicans – <unk> , <unk> de coyote ; origin : Central Mexico 
 C. gracilior 
 The taxonomy by Nee closely matches the species groupings reported in a pair of studies by a botanical team led by Rhodes and Bemis in 1968 and 1970 based on statistical groupings of several phenotypic traits of 21 species . Seeds for studying additional species members were not available . Sixteen of the 21 species were grouped into five clusters with the remaining five being classified separately : 
 C. digitata , C. palmata , C. californica , C. <unk> , C. cordata 
 C. <unk> , C. <unk> , C. <unk> 
 C. sororia , C. gracilior , C. palmeri ; C. argyrosperma ( reported as C. mixta ) was considered close to the three previous species 
 C. maxima , C. <unk> 
 C. pepo , C. texana 
 C. moschata , C. ficifolia , C. pedatifolia , C. foetidissima , and C. <unk> were placed in their own separate species groups as they were not considered significantly close to any of the other species studied . 
 = = = Phylogeny = = = 
 The full phylogeny of this genus is unknown , and research was ongoing in 2014 . The following cladogram of Cucurbita phylogeny is based upon a 2002 study of mitochondrial DNA by <unk> and colleagues . 
 = = Reproductive biology = = 
 All species of Cucurbita have 20 pairs of chromosomes . Many North and Central American species are visited by specialist pollinators in the apid tribe <unk> , especially the genera <unk> and <unk> , and these squash bees can be crucial to the flowers producing fruit after pollination . 
 When there is more pollen applied to the stigma , more seeds are produced in the fruits and the fruits are larger with greater likelihood of maturation , an effect called <unk> . <unk> grown specimens are therefore often hand @-@ pollinated to maximize the number of seeds in the fruit , which increases the fruit size ; this pollination requires skilled technique . <unk> is known to occur in certain cultivars of C. pepo . 
 The most critical factors in flowering and fruit set are physiological , having to do with the age of the plant and whether it already has developing fruit . The plant hormones ethylene and auxin are key in fruit set and development . Ethylene promotes the production of female flowers . When a plant already has a fruit developing , subsequent female flowers on the plant are less likely to mature , a phenomenon called " first @-@ fruit dominance " , and male flowers are more frequent , an effect that appears due to reduced natural ethylene production within the plant stem . <unk> , a plant growth regulator product that is converted to ethylene after metabolism by the plant , can be used to increase fruit and seed production . 
 The plant hormone <unk> , produced in the stamens , is essential for the development of all parts of the male flowers . The development of female flowers is not yet understood . <unk> is also involved in other developmental processes of plants such as seed and stem growth . 
 = = = Germination and seedling growth = = = 
 Seeds with maximum germination potential develop ( in C. moschata ) by 45 days after anthesis , and seed weight reaches its maximum 70 days after anthesis . Some varieties of C. pepo germinate best with eight hours of sunlight daily and a planting depth of 1 @.@ 2 centimeters ( 0 @.@ 47 in ) . Seeds planted deeper than 12 @.@ 5 centimeters ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) are not likely to germinate . In C. foetidissima , a weedy species , plants younger than 19 days old are not able to sprout from the roots after removing the shoots . In a seed batch with 90 percent germination rate , over 90 percent of the plants had sprouted after 29 days from planting . 
 Experiments have shown that when more pollen is applied to the stigma , as well as the fruit containing more seeds and being larger ( the <unk> effect mentioned above ) , the germination of the seeds is also faster and more likely , and the seedlings are larger . Various combinations of mineral nutrients and light have a significant effect during the various stages of plant growth . These effects vary significantly between the different species of Cucurbita . A type of stored phosphorus called phytate forms in seed tissues as spherical crystalline intrusions in protein bodies called <unk> . Along with other nutrients , phytate is used completely during seedling growth . Heavy metal contamination , including cadmium , has a significant negative impact on plant growth . Cucurbita plants grown in the spring tend to grow larger than those grown in the autumn . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Archaeological investigations have found evidence of domestication of Cucurbita going back over 8 @,@ 000 years from the very southern parts of Canada down to Argentina and Chile . Centers of domestication stretch from the Mississippi River watershed and Texas down through Mexico and Central America to northern and western South America . Of the 27 species that Nee delineates , five are domesticated . Four of them , C. argyrosperma , C. ficifolia , C. moschata , and C. pepo , originated and were domesticated in Mesoamerica ; for the fifth , C. maxima , these events occurred in South America . 
 Within C. pepo , the pumpkins , the scallops , and possibly the <unk> are ancient and were domesticated at different times and places . The domesticated forms of C. pepo have larger fruits than non @-@ domesticated forms and seeds that are bigger but fewer in number . In a 1989 study on the origins and development of C. pepo , botanist Harry Paris suggested that the original wild specimen had a small round fruit and that the modern pumpkin is its direct descendant . He suggested that the <unk> , ornamental gourd , and scallop are early variants and that the acorn is a cross between the scallop and the pumpkin . 
 C. argyrosperma is not as widespread as the other species . The wild form C. a. subsp. sororia is found from Mexico to Nicaragua , and cultivated forms are used in a somewhat wider area stretching from Panama to the southeastern United States . It was probably bred for its seeds , which are large and high in oil and protein , but its flesh is of poorer quality than that of C. moschata and C. pepo . It is grown in a wide altitudinal range : from sea level to as high as 1 @,@ 800 meters ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) in dry areas , usually with the use of irrigation , or in areas with a defined rainy season , where seeds are sown in May and June . 
 C. ficifolia and C. moschata were originally thought to be Asiatic in origin , but this has been disproven . The origin of C. ficifolia is Latin America , most likely southern Mexico , Central America , or the Andes . It grows at altitudes ranging from 1 @,@ 000 meters ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) to 3 @,@ 000 meters ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) in areas with heavy rainfall . It does not hybridize well with the other cultivated species as it has significantly different enzymes and chromosomes . 
 C. maxima originated in South America over 4 @,@ 000 years ago , probably in Argentina and Uruguay . The plants are sensitive to frost , and they prefer both bright sunlight and soil with a pH of 6 @.@ 0 to 7 @.@ 0 . C. maxima did not start to spread into North America until after the arrival of Columbus . Varieties were in use by native peoples of the United States by the 16th century . Types of C. maxima include <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Banana , Delicious , Hubbard , Marrow ( C. maxima Marrow ) , Show , and Turban . 
 C. moschata is native to Latin America , but the precise location of origin is uncertain . It has been present in Mexico , Belize , Guatemala , and Peru for 4 @,@ 000 – 6 @,@ 000 years and has spread to Bolivia , Ecuador , Panama , Puerto Rico , and Venezuela . This species is closely related to C. argyrosperma . A variety known as the Seminole Pumpkin has been cultivated in Florida since before the arrival of Columbus . Its leaves are 20 to 30 centimeters ( 8 to 12 in ) wide . It generally grows at low altitudes in hot climates with heavy rainfall , but some varieties have been found above 2 @,@ 200 meters ( 7 @,@ 200 ft ) . Groups of C. moschata include Cheese , <unk> ( C. moschata ) , and Bell . 
 C. pepo is one of the oldest , if not the oldest , domesticated species with the oldest known locations being Oaxaca , Mexico , 8 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 years ago , and Ocampo , Tamaulipas , Mexico , about 7 @,@ 000 years ago . It is known to have appeared in Missouri , United States , at least 4 @,@ 000 years ago . Debates about the origin of C. pepo have been on @-@ going since at least 1857 . There have traditionally been two opposing theories about its origin : 1 ) that it is a direct descendant of C. texana and 2 ) that C. texana is merely feral C. pepo . A more recent theory by botanist Thomas Andres in 1987 is that descendants of C. fraterna hybridized with C. texana , resulting in two distinct domestication events in two different areas : one in Mexico and one in the eastern United States , with C. fraterna and C. texana , respectively , as the ancestral species . C. pepo may have appeared in the Old World before moving from Mexico into South America . It is found from sea level to slightly above 2 @,@ 000 meters ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) . Leaves have 3 – 5 lobes and are 20 – 35 centimeters ( 8 – 14 in ) wide . All the subspecies , varieties , and cultivars are <unk> . In 1986 Paris proposed a revised taxonomy of the edible cultivated C. pepo based primarily on the shape of the fruit , with eight groups . All but a few C. pepo cultivars can be included in these groups . There is one non @-@ edible cultivated variety : C. pepo var. <unk> . 
 = = History and domestication = = 
 The ancestral species of the genus Cucurbita were present in the Americas before the arrival of humans , and are native to the New World . The likely center of origin is southern Mexico , spreading south through what is now known as Mesoamerica , on into South America , and north to what is now the southwestern United States . Evolutionarily speaking , the genus is relatively recent in origin , dating back only to the Holocene , whereas the family Cucurbitaceae , in the shape of seeds similar to <unk> , dates to the Paleocene . No species within the genus is entirely genetically isolated . C. moschata can <unk> with all the others , though the hybrid offspring may not themselves be fertile unless they become polyploid . The genus was part of the culture of almost every native peoples group from southern South America to southern Canada . Modern @-@ day cultivated Cucurbita are not found in the wild . Genetic studies of the mitochondrial gene <unk> show there were at least six independent domestication events of Cucurbita separating domestic species from their wild ancestors . Species native to North America include C. digitata ( <unk> ) , and C. foetidissima ( buffalo gourd ) , C. palmata ( coyote melon ) , and C. pepo . Some species , such as C. digitata and C. ficifolia , are referred to as gourds . <unk> , also called bottle @-@ gourds , which are used as utensils or vessels , belong to the genus Lagenaria and are native to Africa . Lagenaria are in the same family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe . 
 The earliest known evidence of the domestication of Cucurbita dates back at least 8 @,@ 000 years ago , predating the domestication of other crops such as maize and beans in the region by about 4 @,@ 000 years . This evidence was found in the <unk> <unk> cave in Oaxaca , Mexico , during a series of excavations in the 1960s and 1970s , possibly beginning in 1959 . Solid evidence of domesticated C. pepo was found in the <unk> <unk> cave in the form of increasing rind thickness and larger peduncles in the newer stratification layers of the cave . By c . 8 @,@ 000 years BP the C. pepo peduncles found are consistently more than 10 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) thick . Wild Cucurbita peduncles are always below this 10 mm barrier . Changes in fruit shape and color indicate that intentional breeding of C. pepo had occurred by no later than 8 @,@ 000 years BP . During the same time frame , average rind thickness increased from 0 @.@ 84 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 033 in ) to 1 @.@ 15 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 045 in ) . 
 Squash was domesticated first , followed by maize and then beans , becoming part of the Three Sisters agricultural system of companion planting . The English word " squash " derives from <unk> ( a green thing eaten raw ) , a word from the Narragansett language , which was documented by Roger Williams , the founder of Rhode Island , in his 1643 publication A Key Into the Language of America . Similar words for squash exist in related languages of the Algonquian family .

 The family Cucurbitaceae has many species used as human food . Cucurbita is one of the most important of those , with the various species being prepared and eaten in many ways . Although the stems and skins tend to be more bitter than the flesh , the fruits and seeds of cultivated varieties are quite edible and need little or no preparation . The flowers and young leaves and shoot tips can also be consumed . The seeds and fruits of most varieties can be stored for long periods of time , particularly the sweet @-@ tasting winter varieties with their thick , inedible skins . Summer squash have a thin , edible skin . The seeds of both types can be roasted , eaten raw , made into pumpkin seed oil , ground into a flour or meal , or otherwise prepared . 
 Squashes are primarily grown for the fresh food market . The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) reported that the ranking of the top five squash @-@ producing countries was stable between 2005 and 2009 . Those countries are : China , India , Russia , the United States , and Egypt . By 2012 , Iran had moved into the 5th slot , with Egypt falling to 6th . The top 10 countries in terms of metric tons of squashes produced are : 
 The only additional countries that rank in the top 20 where squashes are native are Cuba , which ranks 14th with 347 @,@ 082 metric tons , and Argentina , which ranks 17th , with 326 @,@ 900 metric tons . In addition to being the 4th largest producer of squashes in the world , the United States is the world 's largest importer of squashes , importing 271 @,@ 614 metric tons in 2011 , 95 percent of that from Mexico . Within the United States , the states producing the largest amounts are Florida , New York , California , and North Carolina . 
 This is how Cucurbita compares to several other major Cucurbitaceae crops in terms of crop tonnage harvested : 
 = = Nutrients = = 
 As an example of <unk> , raw summer squash is 94 % water , 3 % carbohydrates , and 1 % protein , with negligible fat content ( table ) . In 100 grams , raw squash supplies 16 calories and is rich in vitamin C ( 20 % of the Daily Value , DV ) , moderate in vitamin B6 and riboflavin ( 12 @-@ 17 % DV ) , but otherwise devoid of appreciable nutrient content ( table ) , although the nutrient content of different <unk> species may vary somewhat . 
 Pumpkin seeds contain vitamin E , crude protein , B vitamins and several dietary minerals ( see nutrition table at <unk> ) . Also present in pumpkin seeds are unsaturated and saturated oils , palmitic , oleic and linoleic fatty acids , as well as carotenoids . 
 = = Toxins = = 
 <unk> is an amino acid and a <unk> that is found in raw Cucurbita seeds . It retards the development of parasitic flukes when administered to infected host mice , although the effect is only seen if administration begins immediately after infection . 
 <unk> is a ribosome inactivating protein found in the flesh and seed of Cucurbita , notably Cucurbita moschata . <unk> is more toxic to cancer cells than healthy cells . 
 <unk> is a plant steroid present in wild Cucurbita and in each member of the family Cucurbitaceae . Poisonous to mammals , it is found in quantities sufficient to discourage herbivores . It makes wild Cucurbita and most ornamental gourds , with the exception of an occasional C. fraterna and C. sororia , bitter to taste . Ingesting too much cucurbitacin can cause stomach cramps , diarrhea and even collapse . This bitterness is especially prevalent in wild Cucurbita ; in parts of Mexico the flesh of the fruits is rubbed on a woman 's breast to wean children . While the process of domestication has largely removed the bitterness from cultivated varieties , there are occasional reports of cucurbitacin causing illness in humans . <unk> is also used as a lure in insect traps . 
 = = Pests and diseases = = 
 Cucurbita species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species , including the Cabbage Moth ( <unk> brassicae ) , <unk> <unk> , and the Turnip Moth ( <unk> <unk> ) . Cucurbita can be susceptible to the pest <unk> <unk> ( <unk> whitefly ) as well as aphids ( <unk> ) , cucumber beetles ( <unk> vittatum and <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , squash bug ( <unk> tristis ) , the squash vine borer ( <unk> <unk> ) , and the <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) . The squash bug causes major damage to plants because of its very toxic saliva . The red pumpkin beetle ( <unk> <unk> ) is a serious pest of cucurbits , especially the pumpkin , which it can defoliate . <unk> are susceptible to diseases such as bacterial wilt ( Erwinia <unk> ) , <unk> ( Colletotrichum spp . ) , <unk> wilt ( Fusarium spp . ) , <unk> blight ( Phytophthora spp. water molds ) , and powdery mildew ( <unk> spp . ) . Defensive responses to viral , fungal , and bacterial leaf pathogens do not involve cucurbitacin . 
 Species in the genus Cucurbita are susceptible to some types of mosaic virus including : Cucumber mosaic virus ( CMV ) , Papaya ringspot virus @-@ cucurbit strain ( <unk> ) , Squash mosaic virus ( <unk> ) , Tobacco ringspot virus ( <unk> ) , Watermelon mosaic virus ( WMV ) , and <unk> yellow mosaic virus ( <unk> ) . <unk> is the only one of these viruses that does not affect all cucurbits . <unk> and CMV are the most common viruses among cucurbits . Symptoms of these viruses show a high degree of similarity , which often results in laboratory investigation being needed to differentiate which one is affecting plants .

 Along with maize and beans , squash has been depicted in the art work of the native peoples of the Americas for at least 2 @,@ 000 years . For example , cucurbits are often represented in Moche ceramics . 
 Though native to the western hemisphere , Cucurbita began to spread to other parts of the world after Christopher Columbus 's arrival in the New World in 1492 . Until recently , the earliest known depictions of this genus in Europe was of Cucurbita pepo in De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes in 1542 by the German botanist Leonhart Fuchs , but in 1992 , two paintings , one of C. pepo and one of C. maxima , painted between 1515 and 1518 , were identified in festoons at Villa Farnesina in Rome . Also , in 2001 depictions of this genus were identified in Grandes Heures of Anne of Brittany ( Les Grandes Heures d 'Anne de Bretagne ) , a French devotional book , an illuminated manuscript created between 1503 and 1508 . This book contains an illustration known as <unk> de <unk> , which was identified by cucurbit specialists as C. pepo subsp. texana in 2006 . 
 In 1952 , Stanley Smith Master , using the pen name Edrich Siebert , wrote " The Marrow Song ( Oh what a beauty ! ) " to a tune in 6 / 8 time . It became a popular hit in Australia in 1973 , and was revived by the Wurzels in Britain on their 2003 album Cutler of the West . John Greenleaf Whittier wrote a poem entitled The Pumpkin in 1850 . " The Great Pumpkin " is a fictional holiday figure in the comic strip Peanuts by Charles M. Schulz .

 Cucurbita have been used in various cultures as folk remedies . Pumpkins have been used by Native Americans to treat intestinal worms and urinary ailments . This Native American remedy was adopted by American doctors in the early nineteenth century as an <unk> for the expulsion of worms . In southeastern Europe , seeds of C. pepo were used to treat irritable bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia . In Germany , pumpkin seed is approved for use by the Commission E , which assesses folk and herbal medicine , for irritated bladder conditions and <unk> problems of prostatic hyperplasia stages 1 and 2 , although the monograph published in 1985 noted a lack of pharmacological studies that could substantiate empirically found clinical activity . The FDA in the United States , on the other hand , banned the sale of all such non @-@ prescription drugs for the treatment of prostate enlargement in 1990 . 
 In China , C. moschata seeds were also used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of the parasitic disease schistosomiasis and for the expulsion of tape worms . 
 In Mexico , herbalists use C. ficifolia in the belief that it reduces blood sugar levels . 
 = = = Culinary uses = = = 
 Long before European contact , Cucurbita had been a major food source for the native peoples of the Americas , and the species became an important food for European settlers , including the Pilgrims , even featuring at the first Thanksgiving . Commercially made pumpkin pie mix is most often made from varieties of C. moschata ; ' Libby 's Select ' uses the Select Dickinson Pumpkin variety of C. moschata for its canned pumpkin . Other foods that can be made using members of this genus include biscuits , bread , cheesecake , desserts , donuts , granola , ice cream , lasagna dishes , pancakes , pudding , pumpkin butter , salads , soups , and stuffing . The xerophytic species are proving useful in the search for nutritious foods that grow well in arid regions . C. ficifolia is used to make soft and mildly alcoholic drinks . 
 In India , squashes ( <unk> ) are cooked with seafood such as prawns . In France , marrows ( <unk> ) are traditionally served as a gratin , sieved and cooked with butter , milk , and egg , and flavored with salt , pepper , and nutmeg , and as soups . In Italy , zucchini and larger squashes are served in a variety of regional dishes , such as <unk> alla <unk> cooked with olive oil , salt and herbs from Puglia ; as torta di <unk> from Liguria , or torta di <unk> e <unk> from Emilia @-@ Romagna , the squashes being made into a pie filling with butter , ricotta , <unk> , egg , and milk ; and as a sauce for pasta in dishes like spaghetti alle <unk> from Sicily . In Japan , squashes such as small C. moschata pumpkins ( <unk> ) are eaten boiled with sesame sauce , fried as a tempura dish , or made into balls with sweet potato and Japanese mountain yam .

 Cucurbita fruits including pumpkins and marrows are celebrated in festivals in countries such as Argentina , Bolivia , Britain , Canada , Croatia , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Peru , Portugal , Spain , Switzerland , and the United States . Argentina holds an annual nationwide pumpkin festival Fiesta Nacional del <unk> ( " Squashes and Pumpkins National Festival " ) , in Ceres , Santa Fe , on the last day of which a Reina Nacional del <unk> ( " National Queen of the Pumpkin " ) is chosen . In Portugal the Festival da <unk> de Lourinhã e <unk> ( " Squashes and Pumpkins Festival in Lourinhã and <unk> " ) is held in Lourinhã city , called the Capital Nacional da <unk> ( the " National Capital of Squashes and Pumpkins " ) . Ludwigsburg , Germany annually hosts the world 's largest pumpkin festival . In Britain a giant marrow ( zucchini ) weighing 54 @.@ <unk> kilograms ( 119 @.@ 750 lb ) was displayed in the Harrogate Autumn Flower Show in 2012 . In the USA , pumpkin chucking is practiced competitively , with machines such as trebuchets and air cannons designed to throw intact pumpkins as far as possible . The Keene Pumpkin Fest is held annually in New Hampshire ; in 2013 it held the world record for the most jack @-@ o @-@ lanterns lit in one place , 30 @,@ 581 on October 19 , 2013 . 
 Halloween is widely celebrated with jack @-@ o @-@ lanterns made of large orange pumpkins carved with ghoulish faces and illuminated from inside with candles . The pumpkins used for jack @-@ o @-@ lanterns are C. pepo , not to be confused with the ones typically used for pumpkin pie in the United States , which are C. moschata . Kew Gardens marked Halloween in 2013 with a display of pumpkins , including a towering pyramid made of many varieties of squash , in the <unk> House during its " <unk> " festival .

 " Beautiful Liar " was written by Mikkel S. Eriksen , Tor Erik Hermansen , Amanda Ghost , Ian Dench , and Beyoncé . It was produced by Eriksen and Hermansen using their stage name , Stargate , and Beyoncé . Eriksen told Sound on Sound , " This song is very simple . Most of the time we have more chords in a song , because we find it hard writing a great song on just one chord . But if you do it right , you can make it work , and this song is an example . " The track had already been written in 2006 . Eriksen and Hermansen played it to their manager , Tyran Smith , who said that it would be perfect for a duet between Shakira and Beyoncé . Eriksen and Hermansen considered this to be impossible , however Smith was devoted to that idea . As they had no lyric or top melody , various writers attempted to finish the song . The first three attempts were not satisfactory , and Smith put Eriksen and Hermansen to work together with Ghost and Dench , who wrote a significant part of the lyrics and the melody . 
 " Beautiful Liar " initially had a Spanish title and different lyrics . Hermansen re @-@ titled it when he heard the line " beautiful liar " in one of the verses . When the production of the song was almost completed , it was presented to Beyoncé , who approved it . She added a few lines to the lyrics and recorded a solo version a few months before the release of the deluxe edition of B 'Day ( 2006 ) . Beyoncé confirmed that she would perform a duet with Shakira in an interview for Univision in December 2006 . In another interview for MTV News , Beyoncé said that she met Shakira several times at various awards shows , and they talked about plans to collaborate on a song as they are both fans of each other and respect each other 's work . Beyoncé said that she was very happy that they were able to work together after waiting for years . 
 When Beyoncé invited her to record a song for the re @-@ release of Beyoncé 's studio second album , B 'Day , Shakira was touring and consequently had difficulties to match her schedule with Beyoncé 's . A few months later , Shakira agreed to sing on the track . As she recorded her vocals , the songwriters and producers added the ethnic strings and percussion break . Beyoncé and Shakira recorded their vocals in different studios ; the vocals were engineered by Gustavo Celis . " Beautiful Liar " was recorded at Sony Music Studios and Battery Studios in New York City , Elastic Mix Studios and The Hit Factory in Florida , and Futura Productions in Boston , Massachusetts .

Beyoncé told MTV News that " Beautiful Liar " is about female empowerment , in keeping with the theme of the album : " It 's about a guy who 's kind of playing both of us , and instead of us arguing over the guy we say , ' Forget him . Let 's stick together . He 's a beautiful liar . " The chorus features the lines , " Let 's not kill the karma , let 's not start a fight " with the female protagonists bonding in their mutual betrayal . Beyoncé and Shakira sing with staccato , intense vocal approach throughout the song . Beyoncé sings the lines " I didn 't know about you then , till I saw you with him again " earnestly while Shakira later adds " I walked in on your love scene , slow dancing " .

 The music video for " Beautiful Liar " was directed by Jake Nava , who directed several of Beyoncé 's other videos . It was filmed over two days , during the two @-@ week production of B 'Day Anthology Video Album . Because of a busy schedule , the production team did not have enough time for the choreography . The dance sequences were choreographed spontaneously and the routines were rehearsed in forty minutes . Beyoncé learned some of the choreography from Shakira , who created most of them and taught Beyoncé some belly dancing moves . Beyoncé originated the idea of playing a lookalike after an experience when she saw a boy dancing , and thought he was performing before a mirror , but realized he was dancing with another person . The music video premiered on Total Request Live on February 28 , 2007 . 
 The first half of the video features Beyoncé and Shakira in separate scenes . It begins with the women 's faces masked by smoke . As the video progresses they are featured against several different backgrounds , including dawn ( Beyoncé ) and dusk ( Shakira ) ; sheets blown in the wind ; bamboo covered with yellow orchids ; a room with blue neon lighting and Avestan writing on the walls ; and a background of stormy weather . Slow dance moves and belly dancing , during a breakdown after the bridge , are featured throughout the video . The women wear matching hairstyles and black outfits for the entirety of the video . 
 Alex Denney of Yahoo ! Music wrote that the dance moves of Beyoncé and Shakira in the video were convincing and erotic " without reaching the point of tackiness .

" Nick Levine of Digital Spy praised the " gratuitous belly @-@ wiggling " choreography in the video . James Montgomery of MTV News noted that the music video " is enough to give you whiplash " due to Beyoncé 's and Shakira 's dance abilities . Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised the scene during the bridge of the song , where Beyoncé and Shakira " begin mirroring each other 's movements " . Anna Pickard of The Guardian praised the clothes of the singers , saying that they matched their " mighty curves " , but criticized Beyoncé 's dancing throughout the video . Erin Strecker of Billboard noted how the clip " taught us all just how perfectly seductive the two could be " . " Beautiful Liar " was nominated for the Video Of The Year award at the 2007 BET Awards , but another Beyoncé video , " Irreplaceable " won it . At the 2007 MTV Video Music Award , it won the Most Earthshattering Collaboration , a new category in the awards show that year .

 Star Wars : Rogue Squadron ( known as Star Wars : Rogue Squadron 3D on the PC ) is an arcade @-@ style action game co @-@ developed by Factor 5 and LucasArts . The first of three games in the Rogue Squadron series , it was published by LucasArts and Nintendo and released for Microsoft Windows and the Nintendo 64 in December 1998 . Rogue Squadron was one of the first games to take advantage of the Nintendo 64 's Expansion Pak , which allows gameplay at a 640 × 480 display resolution , instead of that system 's standard 320 × 240 resolution . 
 Set in the fictional Star Wars galaxy and inspired by the Star Wars : X @-@ wing Rogue Squadron comics , the game takes place primarily between events in the films Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back . The player controls Luke Skywalker , commander of the elite X @-@ wing pilots known as Rogue Squadron . As the game progresses , Skywalker and Rogue Squadron fight the Galactic Empire in sixteen missions across various planets . 
 Rogue Squadron received generally positive reviews . Critics praised the game 's technical achievements and flight controls , but its use of distance fog and the lack of a multiplayer mode drew criticism . The game 's sales exceeded expectations ; by August 1999 , more than one million copies had sold worldwide . It spawned two sequels developed and released for the GameCube — Star Wars Rogue Squadron II : Rogue Leader and Star Wars Rogue Squadron III : Rebel Strike — as well as Star Wars : Episode I : Battle for Naboo , a spiritual successor released for Windows and Nintendo 64 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Unlike the Star Wars : X @-@ Wing computer game series that emphasizes space combat simulation , Rogue Squadron is a fast @-@ paced , arcade @-@ style action game . Each of the game 's sixteen levels introduces mission objectives that must be completed to progress to the next level . These objectives are divided into four categories : search and destroy , reconnaissance , rescue , and protect . Enemy aircraft are primarily composed of TIE fighters . Ground defenses are more varied and include three different walkers , laser and missile turrets , tanks , probe droids , shuttles , stormtroopers and speeder bikes . 
 The heads @-@ up display features a health meter , a radar and an ammunition count for secondary weapons . The player can control five craft : X @-@ wing , A @-@ wing , Y @-@ wing , <unk> and V @-@ wing . Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement , as well as varying degrees of speed and maneuverability . The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level ; however , after a level is completed , it can be replayed with any available craft . Levels set on non @-@ atmospheric moons expose the player 's craft to space ; thus disallowing the Speeder and V @-@ Wing ( which are <unk> ) from being used ; but as on other levels , the craft is vertically confined . Nine bonus power @-@ ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game . These bonuses improve a craft 's weapons or durability and are applied to each eligible craft for the remainder of the game . 
 The player 's performance is measured throughout the game , and performance statistics are checked after each level against three medal benchmarks . Each benchmark contains five categories : completion time , number of enemies destroyed , shot accuracy , number of friendly craft and structures saved and number of bonuses collected . If a player 's performance exceeds one of the level 's three benchmarks in all five categories , a medal — bronze , silver or gold — is awarded on completion . Acquiring these medals promotes the player 's rank and helps unlock hidden content .

 Rogue Squadron includes a number of unlockable secrets . The player can unlock three bonus levels : " Beggar 's Canyon " , " The Death Star Trench Run " and " The Battle of Hoth " . These levels are made available when the player obtains all bronze , silver or gold medals , respectively , on each level . Alternatively , they can be unlocked via password . Unlike the game 's primary levels , the bonus levels are adaptions of events from the Star Wars films . " Beggar 's Canyon " allows the player to reenact the race mentioned in A New Hope , while " The Death Star Trench Run " allows the player to execute an alternate version of the movie 's climactic battle . In the " Battle of Hoth " bonus level , the player can join the Rebel Alliance 's combat against Imperial troops , as depicted in The Empire Strikes Back . 
 Several craft are also available when unlocked . Both the Millennium Falcon and a TIE interceptor are initially present in the craft selection screen . However , neither may be selected until the player enters the correct passwords or achieves all bronze or silver medals , respectively , on the bonus levels . Two other craft can be unlocked , but each is confined to a specific level . One is the T @-@ 16 <unk> in " Beggar 's Canyon " , and an AT @-@ ST is playable in a basic demonstration level unlocked only via password . A playable model of a 1969 Buick Electra 225 based on a car owned by the game 's sound designer , Rudolph Stember , is also included in the game as an Easter egg . 
 During Rogue Squadron 's development , Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace — the first new Star Wars film in more than 15 years — was less than one year from its scheduled release date . To take advantage of this marketing opportunity , Factor 5 included content from the upcoming film in Rogue Squadron . LucasFilm provided the developers with design art for the Naboo Starfighter , a ship prominently featured in the new film . These designs were used to create an in @-@ game model . Because the game was scheduled to be released six months before the film , Factor 5 was required to keep the ship 's inclusion a secret . As a result , most of the game 's development team at Factor 5 and LucasArts were not informed of its inclusion . A complex scrambling system was also developed to help hide the ship 's code from gamers using cheat cartridges such as GameShark or Action Replay . More than six months after the release of Rogue Squadron , LucasArts unveiled the code to unlock the Naboo Starfighter as a playable craft . The code has been named the Nintendo 64 's most well @-@ hidden code because of the length of time before its discovery .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Star Wars : Rogue Squadron is set in the fictional Star Wars galaxy , where a war is fought between the Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance . The game 's first fifteen levels occur six months after the Battle of Yavin — as depicted in A New Hope — and before the events of The Empire Strikes Back . As the Empire gathers strength for an all @-@ out assault on the rebel forces , Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles form Rogue Squadron , a group comprising twelve of the most skilled X @-@ wing pilots from the Rebel Alliance . 
 The sixteenth and final level of the game takes place during Dark Empire , six years after Star Wars Episode VI : Return of the Jedi 's Battle of Endor . The Rebel Alliance has established the New Republic , which now controls three quarters of the galaxy . After the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader , the Galactic Empire collapsed , but was reborn under a mysterious new leader ( who is actually a clone of Palpatine ) . Rogue Squadron , now under the command of Wedge Antilles , continues to fight the Empire to protect the newly formed Republic . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The story is divided into four chapters , each of which starts with an opening crawl resembling those featured in the Star Wars films . Further story details are presented through the game 's instruction manual , pre @-@ mission briefings , character conversations during the game and in @-@ game cut scenes . The game begins with Rogue Squadron briefly encountering the Empire at the Mos Eisley spaceport on Tatooine . The team then executes escort and rescue missions on <unk> and <unk> , respectively . 
 The Rebels learn that Imperial officer Crix Madine wishes to defect to the Rebel Alliance . The Empire launches an attack on <unk> , where Madine is stationed , to prevent his departure . Rogue Squadron , with the help of Han Solo and Chewbacca in the Millennium Falcon , fights off the Empire and helps escort Madine safely off the planet . Soon after , Rogue Squadron is joined by Gold Squadron , a group of Y @-@ wings now led by Crix Madine ; they are dispatched to the moon of Gerrard V to aid its quest for independence from the Empire . They encounter the 128th TIE interceptor Squadron and disable Kasan Moor 's TIE . When Rogue Squadron tells Moor that she has been taken prisoner , she offers to defect and provide the Rebel Alliance with Imperial intelligence . 
 With the help of Kasan Moor 's intelligence , the Alliance launches three consecutive attacks on Imperial bases throughout the galaxy . After an assault on the Imperial Enclave , a facility on Kile II supporting the Empire 's Naval operations , Wedge Antilles is ambushed by a group of <unk> and is taken captive . The Rebel Alliance tracks Wedge to an Imperial prison complex on the planet of Kessel . The remaining members of Rogue Squadron travel to Kessel and rescue him and other Rebel prisoners . 
 With Wedge Antilles free and Rogue Squadron again at full strength , the Rebel Alliance turns its attention to a new Imperial threat — Moff Kohl Seerdon . Seerdon is consolidating Imperial power in preparation for an attack aimed at capturing Thyferra , a planet which produces the healing substance <unk> . Rogue Squadron is ordered to disrupt his operation with hit @-@ and @-@ run missions against key targets on <unk> and Fest . In retaliation , Seerdon attacks and holds a city on the planet of <unk> hostage . Rogue Squadron and the Alliance strike back by initiating a Kasan Moor @-@ engineered raid on an Imperial base located inside a volcano on Sullust . While still on Sullust , however , General <unk> informs the Squadron that Moff Seerdon has used their raid as a diversion and begun his attack on Thyferra . With Seerdon in control of the planet 's <unk> and their own supply threatened , Rogue Squadron quickly reaches Thyferra , kills Seerdon and frees the planet . 
 In the final chapter , the game moves into the future , six years after the Battle of Endor . Rogue Squadron , now under the command of Wedge Antilles , continues to fight the wounded Empire . On the planet of Mon Calamari , new Imperial weapons called World Devastators are destroying the planet . Rogue Squadron is deployed , disables all three Devastators and destroys the Imperial presence .

 After the success of Star Wars : Shadows of the Empire on the Nintendo 64 in 1996 , LucasArts began planning a follow @-@ up . At the time , Factor 5 was developing a game engine to create large terrain maps . LucasArts , pleased with earlier collaborations with the company , decided to use Factor 5 's engine for its new game . The game 's focus would be space combat ; this direction was inspired by a level of Shadows of the Empire in which the player flies a <unk> during the Battle of Hoth . Rogue Squadron and Factor 5 production manager Brett Tosti stated , " That whole scene was actually the genesis for Rogue Squadron because everybody said , ' Why don 't you do a whole game like that ? ' So we did . " Factor 5 initially pitched a concept to allow gamers to play through missions similar to the fans ' favorite action sequences from the Star Wars films . This proposal was rejected , however . At that time , LucasFilm was not comfortable with video games drawing directly from the films . 
 During the early stages of development , the designers at LucasArts were inspired by Rogue Squadron and later Star Wars : X @-@ wing Rogue Squadron , a series of books and comic books set during the years of the original film trilogy . They began developing the story and gameplay with a similar setting that would include characters from the films participating in new , original missions using Factor 5 's terrain map engine as the base . In May 1998 , a demo of the game was displayed at E3 , but the game was so incomplete at the time that Tosti considered it a tech demo . It rendered a basic heightmap and an immobile AT @-@ AT model , while TIE fighters lacking artificial intelligence flew and fired in a predetermined path . When " playing " the demo for audiences , Tosti followed a very specific flight path of his own to give the illusion that he was actually battling with the <unk> . Despite the demo 's barebones presentation , response from gamers was largely positive . 
 Factor 5 appealed to Nintendo to use the Nintendo 64 's newly developed memory Expansion Pak . Nintendo was reluctant , expecting the technology to be reserved solely for hardware peripherals . However , after Iguana Entertainment used the Expansion Pak to achieve a higher display resolution for Turok 2 : Seeds of Evil , Factor 5 was given the green light . The Expansion Pak is used to increase Rogue Squadron 's N64 resolution from 320 × 240 to 640 × 480 . 
 LucasFilm was hesitant to grant access to the Star Wars library of sound effects for the game 's sound designer , Rudolph Stember . As a compromise , the company provided Stember with sounds sampled at the relatively low rate of 22 kHz , half the standard rate . Stember objected , claiming that the clips sounded worse than effects he had lifted from VHS tapes for a previous Star Wars project . The game includes voice work from several notable persons , including screen actors Olivia Hussey and Raphael Sbarge as well as voice actors Bob Bergen , Neil Ross and Terence McGovern . Instead of using Nintendo 's default sound drivers , Factor 5 developed its own tool called <unk> FX Surround . The Factor 5 drivers use Nintendo 64 processors , but tax them less ; advanced compression techniques were also employed . As a result , the game includes over 80 minutes of high @-@ quality stereo sound . 
 In November 1998 , a month before the game 's scheduled release , LucasArts signed a worldwide agreement with Nintendo concerning three new Star Wars video games . It granted Nintendo the rights to market the games and hold exclusive , worldwide distribution rights for five years following each release . Rogue Squadron was the first game released under this agreement .

 Many reviews compared Star Wars : Rogue Squadron to one of its inspirations , the Battle of Hoth flight combat level in Star Wars : Shadows of the Empire , considered one of that game 's best elements . GamePro remarked that Rogue Squadron " enhanced the flight model with true pitch , roll , and bank mechanics " . IGN praised its inclusion of " upgrades , more enemies , better sound , and stunning second @-@ generation graphics " . The Nintendo 64 version received mostly positive reviews , and received an aggregate score of 85 percent from both GameRankings and Metacritic . GamePro named it one of the best games released in 1998 . In a 2008 retrospective , IGN 's Levi Buchanan stated that the game revived the Star Wars license on consoles through well @-@ paced gameplay , a story tied into the Star Wars canon and visuals that made it " one of the generation 's top stunners " . 
 The game 's technical aspects were singled out for acclaim . Its visuals were called " respectable " in the standard resolution , but highly praised in high @-@ resolution mode ( achieved via the Nintendo 64 's Expansion Pak ) . GameSpot remarked that in a higher resolution , " [ the ] textures of the landscapes , the ships , the lighting effects — everything looks so much better , " while IGN 's Peer Schneider said , " After playing the game in the optional high resolution mode ( 640 × 480 ) once , it 's impossible to go back to the still respectable standard resolution . " Citing details such as decals , Rebel markings , R2 units , cockpit views and exhaust flames , Schneider described the game 's 3D ship models as " gorgeous " . IGN 's Matt Casamassina said that the game was the best @-@ looking Nintendo 64 game to date . 
 Reviewers also praised the game 's sound design . Powered by the new Factor 5 audio drivers , Rogue Squadron features about 40 minutes of speech and 40 minutes of music . GameSpot 's Ryan Mac Donald believed that the game 's inclusion of extended voice work helped create a " movie @-@ like " atmosphere . IGN noted that in addition to being technically impressive , the game 's Dolby Pro Logic surround sound was an important gameplay element . The audio signals helped players determine enemy positions and direction of travel . IGN awarded the game three sound awards , including Sound Effects , Best Voice and Best Overall Sound of 1998 on the Nintendo 64 . 
 Some reviewers complained about aspects of the game 's visuals ; critics disliked the heavy reliance on distance fog . Another common criticism of the game was the lack of multiplayer modes . GamePro 's review called the omission a " serious , unforgivable sin " ; Schneider believed that while adding these modes would have extended Rogue Squadron 's replay value , the game was still enjoyable for its medal reward system and large number of secrets and unlockables . 
 Although nearly identical , the game 's PC version garnered lower review scores than its Nintendo 64 counterpart , with an aggregated GameRankings score of 80 percent . This version enjoyed many of the same praises for its gameplay , but handling and graphics were cited as problematic . Directly comparing the two versions , AllGame 's Brad Cook wrote that PC version 's handling is more difficult than the N64 version . He believed the PC 's " choppy " feel made it difficult to target enemies . In contrast to its opinion of the N64 version , IGN 's PC review was not enthusiastic about the game 's visuals . IGN staff remarked that Rogue Squadron 's " graphics and special effects aren 't spectacular " and that they had " seen better graphics " on the PC .

 When Rogue Squadron was released in early December 1998 , the title 's Nintendo 64 incarnation was the second @-@ highest @-@ selling video game for the first half of the month ( behind Nintendo 's The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time ) and the holiday season . Delayed until after Christmas in the United Kingdom , the game was released mid @-@ January and debuted as the second @-@ best @-@ selling game of the month , ahead of Ocarina of Time . In August 1999 , Nintendo added the title to its best @-@ selling Player 's Choice collection , while the PC version was re @-@ released as a part of the LucasArts Archive Series in May 2001 . Rogue Squadron 's retail success was not anticipated by the game 's producer Julian <unk> , who said that the game sold " about 100 times better than anybody expected " . The Nintendo 64 version sold over 1 million copies in the United States , and over 44 @,@ 000 in Japan . 
 = HMS Glatton ( 1914 ) = 
 HMS Glatton and her sister ship Gorgon were originally built as coastal defence ships for the Royal Norwegian Navy , as Bjørgvin and Nidaros respectively . She was requisitioned from Norway at the beginning of World War I , but was not completed until 1918 although she had been launched over three years earlier . On 16 September 1918 , before she had even gone into action , she suffered a large fire in one of her 6 @-@ inch magazines , and had to be scuttled to prevent an explosion of her main magazines that would have devastated Dover . Her wreck was partially salvaged in 1926 , and moved into a position in the northeastern end of the harbour where it would not obstruct traffic . It was subsequently buried by landfill underneath the current car ferry terminal . 
 = = Background = = 
 Bjørgvin was ordered by Norway in 1913 to supplement the older <unk> class and <unk> class classes of coastal defense ships . She would have been known in Norway as P / S Bjørgvin ; P / S stands for <unk> ( " armoured ship " ) , while Bjørgvin was the old name for the Norwegian city of Bergen . However , when World War I broke out , the Royal Navy requisitioned most warships under construction in Britain for foreign powers and refunded the two @-@ thirds of Bjørgvin 's £ 370 @,@ 000 purchase price already paid by the Norwegians . 
 = = Construction and description = = 
 Bjørgvin was laid down by Armstrong Whitworth at Elswick on 26 May 1913 and launched on 8 August 1914 . She was renamed Glatton after an earlier breastwork monitor of 1871 . Her completion was greatly delayed by the modifications made by the British , which included modifying the boilers to use both oil and coal and conversion of 12 double @-@ bottom tanks to carry the oil . This work began on 9 January 1915 , but was suspended the following May , when it was estimated that only another 10 – 12 months of work remained , to allow for faster progress to be made on the large light cruisers Furious and Courageous that were building in Armstrong 's Naval Yard downriver . In September 1917 , work was resumed to a new design that added a large anti @-@ torpedo bulge along about 75 % of the hull 's length , suppression of the torpedo tubes and 100 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) guns planned by the Norwegians , and a large tripod mast was to be fitted behind the single funnel to carry the directors for both the 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) and 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch ( 234 mm ) guns . Both of these guns had to be relined to use standard British ammunition and the mount for the 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch gun was modified to give a maximum elevation of 40 ° which gave the gun a maximum range of 39 @,@ 000 yards ( 36 @,@ 000 m ) . Addition of the bulges cost 2 knots ( 3 @.@ 7 km / h ; 2 @.@ 3 mph ) in speed , but prevented the extra weight resulting from all of these changes from deepening her draft . She was finally completed on 8 September 1918 . 
 Glatton displaced 5 @,@ 746 long tons ( 5 @,@ 838 t ) at deep load as built , with a length of 310 ft ( 94 m ) , a beam of 73 feet 7 inches ( 22 @.@ 4 m ) at maximum , although her main hull only had a beam of 55 feet ( 16 @.@ 8 m ) and a draught of 16 feet 4 inches ( 5 @.@ 0 m ) . She was powered by two vertical triple expansion steam engines , which developed a total of 4 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 3 @,@ 000 kW ) from four Yarrow watertube boilers and gave a maximum speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . 
 She was armed with two 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch guns arranged in two single @-@ gun turrets , one each fore and aft . Her secondary armament consisted of four six @-@ inch guns , also in single @-@ gun turrets , two of which <unk> over the 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch turrets . The other two were positioned on each side of the superstructure . One 3 in ( 76 mm ) anti @-@ aircraft gun was mounted on each center @-@ line 6 @-@ inch turret . She also carried four 3 @-@ pounder and two 2 @-@ pounder guns on high @-@ angle mounts .

 After completion , Glatton sailed for Dover on 11 September 1918 to prepare for the offensive planned for later that month . At 6 : 15 on the evening of 16 September , Glatton 's midships 6 @-@ inch magazine had a low @-@ order explosion that ignited the cordite stored there . Flames shot through the roof of ' Q ' turret , starboard <unk> , and started to spread aft . The ship 's captain — Commander N. W. Diggle — ordered the forward magazines flooded , but the crew were unable to flood the rear magazines as the flames blocked access to the magazine flooding controls . The presence of the ammunition ship <unk> only 150 yards ( 140 m ) away risked a massive explosion that would devastate Dover if Glatton 's rear magazine exploded and set off <unk> 's ammunition . Vice @-@ Admiral Keyes — who had been walking with Commander Diggle when Glatton 's magazine exploded — boarded the recently arrived destroyer Cossack once apprised of the danger . He ordered Cossack to torpedo Glatton in an attempt to flood the magazine before it detonated . Cossack 's first 18 @-@ inch ( 460 mm ) torpedo struck the anti @-@ torpedo bulge amidships , but failed to explode because it had been fired too close to Glatton . Her second torpedo blew a hole in Glatton at 7 : 40 , but the torpedo 's 200 @-@ pound ( 91 kg ) warhead was too small to penetrate through her bulge and Glatton remained afloat , still burning . Keyes transferred to the destroyer <unk> and ordered her to fire on Glatton with her 21 @-@ inch ( 530 mm ) torpedoes at 8 : 15 . They were aimed at the hole blown in Glatton 's starboard side by Cossack 's second torpedo and succeeded in causing Glatton to capsize until her masts and superstructure rested on the harbour bottom and dousing the fire . Casualties were heavy : 60 men were killed outright and 124 were injured of whom 19 later died of their burns . 
 = = = Inquiry = = = 
 A Court of Enquiry held immediately afterwards found that the explosion had occurred in the midships 6 @-@ inch magazine situated between the boiler and engine rooms . The cause was more difficult to establish , but the Court did note that the stokers were in the habit of piling the red @-@ hot clinker and ashes from the boilers against the bulkhead directly adjoining the magazine to cool down before they were sent up the ash ejector . The magazine was well insulated with 5 inches ( 13 cm ) of cork , covered by wood planking .75 inches ( 1 @.@ 9 cm ) thick and provided with special cooling equipment so it was not likely that the cordite had spontaneously combusted . The magazine of Glatton 's sister ship Gorgon was emptied and examined . The red lead paint on the bulkhead was blistered beneath the lagging and tests at the National Physical Laboratory demonstrated that it had been subject to temperatures of at least 400 ° F ( 204 ° C ) . Recorded temperatures inside the magazine did not exceed 83 ° F ( 28 ° C ) and a test of red @-@ hot ashes was inconclusive as the temperature in the lagging only reached 70 ° F ( 21 ° C ) with occasional hot spots of 150 ° F ( 66 ° C ) . Other tests did reveal that the cork could give off flammable fumes under high heat and pressurized air . While not entirely satisfied with this conclusion it found in April 1919 that " The slow combustion of the cork lagging of the 6 @-@ inch midship magazine of the Glatton led to the ignition of the magazine and then to the ignition of the cordite in it and so caused the explosion . " 
 As a precaution , Gorgon 's lagging was stripped out and replaced with silicate wool , revealing the real cause . Part of the cork was missing and folded newspapers were found in the empty space which were left there by the dockyard workers during construction . Furthermore , a number of rivets were entirely missing which meant that 0 @.@ 5 inches ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) holes were present , which could have allowed the hot ashes to ignite the newspapers . The forced @-@ draught pressure in the boiler room would have supplied air through the rivet holes , causing the cork to give off flammable gases , and eventually ignite the cordite charges . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 Glatton remained in Dover Harbour , an obstruction to shipping , with her hull visible at low tide as the Harbour Board could not afford the £ 45 @,@ 000 quoted on average by salvage companies . Finally they asked the <unk> , Captain John Iron , if he could do it for less . He estimated it would cost about £ 5 @,@ 000 if he was granted use of the salvage craft already at Dover . The Board accepted his offer and work began in May 1925 . Some 12 @,@ 000 short tons ( 11 @,@ 000 t ) of silt were removed from underneath Glatton and her mainmast and superstructure were blasted away from the wreck . Four lifting lighters , with a capacity of 1 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ 000 t ) , were hired , but they would not suffice to lift a water @-@ logged 5 @,@ 000 long tons ( 5 @,@ 100 t ) ship . It was necessary to seal all of the holes on her topside and pump air into each compartment at a rate of 70 @,@ 000 cubic feet ( 2 @,@ 000 m3 ) per minute to restore her buoyancy . The first attempt to lift her began on 2 December 1925 and was successful in breaking the suction holding her to the bottom in combination with the rising tide . That was enough for the first try and the major lifting effort began the following day . Slowly she was moved , taking advantage of the tides , until on 16 March 1926 she was moved to a deep gully next to the western pier of the submarine harbour , close by the shore . The total cost was considerably more than originally estimated , but still far less than that quoted by the salvage companies , at no more than £ 12 @,@ 000 . There she remains , buried by landfill underneath the current car ferry terminal .

 A memorial was erected at St Mary 's Church and Grange Road cemetery in Gillingham , Kent . It was used from 1867 until 1973 when the site was largely cleared of memorials to provide a community open space for the local population .

 = Leo Martello = 
 Leo Martello ( September 26 , 1931 – June 29 , 2000 ) was a Sicilian @-@ American witch and gay rights activist , and author . He was a founding member of the Strega Tradition of Witchcraft , a form of the modern Pagan new religious movement which drew upon his own Sicilian heritage . During his lifetime he published a number of books on such esoteric subjects as Witchcraft , astrology , and tarot reading . 
 Born to a working @-@ class Italian American family in Dudley , Massachusetts , he was raised Roman Catholic although became interested in esotericism as a teenager . He later claimed that when he was 21 , relatives initiated him into a tradition of witchcraft inherited from their Sicilian ancestors ; this conflicts with other statements that he made , and there is no independent evidence to corroborate his claim . During the 1950s , he was based in New York City , where he worked as a graphologist and hypnotist . After beginning to publish books on paranormal topics in the early 1960s , he publicly began identifying as Wiccan in 1969 , and stated that he was involved in a New York coven . 
 After the Stonewall riots of 1969 , Martello – himself a gay man – involved himself in gay rights activism , becoming a member of the Gay Liberation Front ( GLF ) . Leaving the GLF following an internal schism , he became a founding member of the Gay Activist Alliance ( GAA ) and authored a regular column , " The Gay Witch " , for its newspaper . In 1970 he founded the Witches International Craft Associates ( WICA ) as a networking organization for Wiccans , and under its auspices organized a " Witch In " that took place in Central Park at Halloween 1970 , despite opposition from the New York City Parks Department . To campaign for the civil rights of Wiccans , he founded the Witches Anti @-@ Defamation League , which was later renamed the Alternative Religions Education Network . In 1973 , he visited England , there being initiated into Gardnerian Wicca by the Gardnerian High Priestess Patricia Crowther . He continued practicing Wicca into the 1990s , when he retreated from public life , eventually succumbing to cancer in 2000 .

 Martello was born on September 26 , 1930 , in Dudley , Massachusetts , being raised on a small farm rented by his father , the Italian immigrant Rocco Luigi Martello . Following the economic turmoil of the Great Depression , the <unk> were forced from their land and moved first to Worcester , Massachusetts and then to <unk> , Massachusetts . It was here that Leo was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church , but his parents divorced soon after . Unable to care for him alone , his father sent Martello to the Catholic boarding preparatory school attached to Assumption College , Worcester , which was run by the Augustinians of the Assumption . He spent six years at the school , later describing it as the unhappiest period of his life . He studied graphology and from the age of 16 began making radio appearances as a graphologist , also writing stories for magazines . 
 Martello later claimed to have experienced psychic phenomena as a child , sparking his interest in occultism . By his early teenage years , he had begun studying palmistry and tarot card reading with a Gypsy named Marta . He also later claimed that his father had informed him that his grandmother , Maria <unk> , had been a psychic known as a Strega Maga ( " Great Witch " ) in her hometown of Enna , Sicily , Italy . According to Martello 's account , <unk> had worked as a folk magician and tarot card reader , and attracted the hatred and envy of the local Catholic clergy . He also related that on one occasion , she had killed a Mafioso using magic when he threatened her husband for not paying protection money . Martello related that when he was 16 , his father told him that he had cousins in New York City who wished to meet him . He proceeded to do so and – according to his account – they informed him that they were initiates of an ancient Italian witchcraft religion , La Vecchia ( " the Old Religion " ) . After identifying his possession of psychic powers , they initiated him into the tradition on his 21st birthday in 1951 , making him swear an oath never to reveal the secrets of the La Vecchia . Moving to the city , he studied at Hunter College and the Institute for Psychotherapy . 
 Martello never produced any proof to support his claims , and there is no independent evidence that corroborate them . An anonymous woman who had known Martello informed the researcher Michael G. Lloyd that during the 1980s , he had told her that he had never been initiated into a tradition of Witchcraft , and that he had simply embraced occultism in the 1960s in order to earn a living . The Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White expressed criticism of Martello 's claims , noting that it was " extremely doubtful " that a tradition of Wicca could have been passed down through Martello 's Sicilian family . Instead , he suggested that Martello might have been instructed in a tradition of folk magic that he later embellished into a form of Wicca , that the cousins themselves had constructed a form of Wicca that they passed on to Martello , or that the entire scenario had been a fabrication of Martello 's .

 Based in New York City , in 1950 Martello founded the American <unk> Academy , continuing to direct the organization until 1954 . From 1955 to 1957 , he served as treasurer of the American <unk> Society , and worked as a freelance graphologist for such corporate clients as the <unk> Corporation of America and the Associated Special Investigators International . He also published a column titled " Your Handwriting Tells " for eight years that ran in the Chelsea Clinton News , and supplied various articles on the subject of graphology to different magazines . In the city , he also began to frequent the gay scene . In 1955 , Martello was awarded a Doctorate in Divinity by a non @-@ accredited organization , the National Congress of Spiritual Consultants , a clearing house for registered yet unaffiliated ministers . That year , he founded the Temple of Spiritual Guidance , taking on the role of Pastor , which he would continue in until 1960 , when he began to focus on his writing and his new philosophy of " <unk> " . In 1961 he published his first book , Your Pen Personality , in which he discussed the manner in which handwriting could be used to reveal the personality of the writer . Martello corresponded with California @-@ based Pagan Victor Henry Anderson , and it was at Martello 's encouragement that Anderson established his Mahaelani Coven circa 1960 . 
 Martello claimed that in the summer of 1964 , he moved to Tangier , Morocco , where he researched the history of the tarot , resulting in the publication of It 's in the Cards ( 1964 ) . Returning to the U.S. in 1965 , he moved in to an apartment in Greenwich Village , New York City , writing a book on astrology , It 's Written in the Stars , and a book on psychic protection , How to Prevent Psychic Blackmail . He also began attending the Spiritualist gatherings that were operated by Clifford Bias at the Ansonia Hotel . At some point High Priestess Lori Bruno founded a witchcraft coven and church , Our Lord and Lady of the <unk> Rose , in which Leo was acknowledged as Elder . In 1969 he publicly revealed himself to be a practitioner of Witchcraft ; claiming that he had gained the permission of his coven to do so . Intent on countering the negative publicity that Wicca had been receiving , he published The Weird Ways of Witchcraft in 1969 , the same year that he also published The Hidden World of <unk> .

 In July 1969 , Martello attended an open meeting of the Mattachine Society 's New York branch . He was appalled at the Society 's negative reaction to the Stonewall riots , and castigated those gay people in the audience who accepted the categorization of homosexuality as a mental illness , accusing them of being self @-@ loathing . He proceeded to publish his thoughts in an essay in which he stated that " homosexuality is not a problem in itself . The problem is society 's attitude towards it . " Those gay rights activists who rejected the Mattachine Society 's approach and who favored a confrontational stance against the police and authorities founded the Gay Liberation Front ( GLF ) , with Martello elected the group 's first moderator . Martello supported the GLF 's stance that condemned " this rotten , dirty , vile , fucked @-@ up capitalist conspiracy " that dominated American society , and he volunteered by producing articles both for the group 's newsletter Come Out ! and for the wider press . He was involved in the GLF 's campaign against The Village Voice 's decision to ban the word " gay " from advertisements ; the magazine preferred the term " homophile " , which had also been used by the Mattachine Society . Wanting to break from previous gay liberation organizations , the GLF embraced the term " gay " , with Martello dismissing " homophile " as sounding like a nail file for homosexuals . 
 The GLF was structured around a system of anarchic consensus , which made it difficult for the group to reach conclusions on any issue , and heated arguments became commonplace at its meetings . In November 1969 , the group 's membership voted to provide political and financial support to the Black Panthers , an armed African @-@ American leftist group . This was heavily controversial among the GLF , given the homophobic nature of the Black Panthers , and resulted in a walk @-@ out of many senior members , including Martello , Arthur Evans , Arthur Bell , <unk> Clarke , and Jack Nichols . That month , Martello was invited to a private meeting of these disaffected GLF members which resulted in the formation of the Gay Activist Alliance ( GAA ) . Although continuing the GLF 's emphasis on taking a confrontational approach to conventional American society and authority , the group was more tightly organized and structured , and focused exclusively on attaining equal rights for gay and lesbian people . The businessman Al Goldstein agreed to invest $ 25 @,@ 000 in the GAA 's new venture , a newspaper written by , and aimed at , the country 's gay community . It was launched in December 1969 as <unk> , and it soon gained a readership of 25 @,@ 000 . Martello contributed a regular column known as " The Gay Witch " , reaching his widest audience to date , also authoring a variety of other articles that appeared in it . 
 = = = WICA and WADL : 1970 – 74 = = = 
 In 1970 , Martello founded the Witches International Craft Associates ( WICA ) , through which he issued The WICA Newsletter , set up to explain what Witchcraft and Wicca was to the wider public and to serve as a resource through which occultists could contact one another . In April 1970 he appeared on the WNEW @-@ TV Channel 5 documentary series <unk> Town , performing Witchcraft rites with several assistants in Central Park . That year saw one of New York 's first substantial gatherings of occultists , the Festival of Occult Arts , as well as the first Earth Day celebration and the first Christopher Street Gay Liberation Day parade . These events inspired Martello 's desire to hold a public Witchcraft Sabbat celebration . Acting under the auspices of WICA , in late summer he approached the New York City Parks Department asking for permission to hold a " Witch @-@ In " in Sheep Meadow , at the south end of Central Park , on October 31 , 1970 . The Department refused , and when Martello stated that the Witchcraft community would gather there regardless in their capacity as private individuals , he was threatened with police action . Martello gained the legal assistance of the New York Civil Liberties Union ( <unk> ) , who informed the Parks Department that they were in breach of the First Amendment . The Department subsequently reversed their decision , and the event went ahead . 
 Inspired by his victory over the Parks Department , Martello founded an organization devoted to campaigning for the religious rights of Witches , the Witches Anti @-@ Defamation League ( WADL ) , which would eventually be renamed the Alternative Religions Education Network ( <unk> ) . For WADL , he authored an essay titled " The Witch Manifesto " , likely influenced by Carl Wittman 's " Refugees from Amerika : A Gay Manifesto " ( 1970 ) , which demanded that the Roman Catholic Church face a tribunal for crimes committed against accused witches in the Early Modern period and that they pay reparations to the modern Witchcraft community for those actions . During this decade he authored a column for Gnostica magazine which was titled " Wicca Basket " , a pun on the phonetic similarity between " Wicca " and " wicker " . 
 In 1971 , a young gay Wiccan named Eddie Buczynski contacted Martello , and requested initiation . Due to Buczynski 's inexperience in the religion , Martello turned him down , although developed a friendship with him . Martello introduced Buczynski both to other covens who might initiate him , and to Herman Slater , who would become his long @-@ time partner . Slater was ill with various medical complications , and on one occasion was rehabilitating at the New York University Medical Center when Martello performed a healing ritual on him with the assistance of Buczynski . Martello would come to be known as a regular at The Warlock Shop , an occult store opened by Slater in New York . Through The WICA Newsletter , Martello had met Lady Gwen Thompson , the founder of the New England Covens of Traditionalist Witches ( NECTW ) , and decided to introduce Buczynski to her , resulting in Buczynski 's initiation into the tradition in Spring 1972 . Martello and Thompson later fell out , with some unconfirmed accounts claiming that it was because he lent her money and she did not pay him back . In October 1972 , Buczynski founded his own tradition of Wicca , termed Welsh Traditionalist Witchcraft , with Martello becoming an early initiate and taking on the name of " Nemesis " within that tradition . In turn , Martello welcomed Buczynski into his La Vecchia tradition , and initiated him through its three degree system . 
 In November 1972 , Martello lectured at the first Friends of the Craft conference , held at New York 's First Unitarian Church . In April 1973 , he moved to England for six months , where he was initiated and trained in the three degrees of Gardnerian Wicca by the Sheffield coven run by Patricia Crowther and her husband Arnold Crowther . He continued to encourage acceptance of homosexuality within the Pagan and Witchcraft community , authoring an article titled " The Gay Pagan " for Green Egg magazine . He expressed the view that homophobic Wiccans were " sexually insecure " and that they viewed the religion simply as " a ritual means of fornication " . He was also among the prominent male Pagans to endorse feminist and female @-@ only variants of Wicca , such as the Dianic Wicca promoted by Zsuzsanna Budapest .

 During the 1990s , Martello retired from his public work . Doyle White noted that while Martello faded from prominence as the head of the Strega Wicca movement , the tradition gained a " new public advocate " in Raven Grimassi . Martello died of cancer on 29 June 2000 . Bruno was the executrix of his estate .

 Lloyd described Martello as " a lanky , hungry scrapper with piercing eyes , the face of a dark angel , and a mouth like a bear trap " , while in her encyclopaedia on Wicca , Rosemary Ellen <unk> described him as " a colourful figure , known for his humor " . Bruno described him as " a loving man , yet sometimes caustic " , stating that to know him " was an honor , and ever a challenge " . He was often noted for his scruffy appearance , with him typically wearing second @-@ hand clothes . 
 = = = Beliefs = = = 
 Martello defended the growing rise of feminists in Wicca during the 1970s , criticizing what he deemed as the continual repression of women within the Pagan movement . He also espoused the view that any Pagan who was involved in the U.S. government or military was a hypocrite . He was critical of Wiccans who espoused a division between white magic and black magic , commenting that it had racial overtones and that many of those advocating such a view were racist . 
 Although aware that historians had criticized the witch @-@ cult hypothesis of Margaret Murray , Martello stood by her claims , believing that the cult had been passed through oral tradition and thus evaded appearing in the textual sources studied by historians . Martello thought it unimportant that many Wiccans had lied about the origins of their beliefs , being quoted by Pagan journalist Margot Adler in her book Drawing Down the Moon as having stated " Let 's assume that many people lied about their lineage . Let 's further assume that there are no covens on the current scene that have any historical basis . The fact remains : they do exist now . And they can claim a spiritual lineage going back thousands of years . All of our pre @-@ Judeo @-@ Christian or Moslem ancestors were Pagans ! "

 = Tropical Storm Julio ( 2008 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Julio was a tropical storm that made landfall on the southern tip of Baja California Sur in August 2008 . The tenth named storm of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season , it developed from a tropical wave on August 23 off the coast of Mexico . It moved parallel to the coast , reaching peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) before moving ashore and weakening . On August 26 it dissipated in the Gulf of California . Julio was the third tropical cyclone to make landfall in the Pacific Ocean basin during the season , after Tropical Storm Alma , which struck Nicaragua in May , and Tropical Depression Five @-@ E , which moved ashore along southwestern Mexico in July . The storm brought locally heavy rainfall to southern Baja California , killing one person and leaving several towns isolated . Moisture from Julio reached Arizona , producing thunderstorms , including one which damaged ten small planes in Chandler . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On August 20 , a tropical wave became discernible about 800 miles ( 1300 km ) off the coast of Mexico , which in the next day developed a large area of convection , or thunderstorms . Initially , conditions were unfavorable for development , due to strong upper @-@ level wind shear . Tracking northwestward parallel to the Mexican coast , the system became better organized on August 22 , though later that day its structure deteriorated . On August 23 , a strong area of convection developed and persisted near a circulation center , despite strong wind shear . With banding features becoming more prominent , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) classified the system as Tropical Depression Eleven @-@ E about 345 miles ( 555 km ) south @-@ southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula . 
 The tropical depression initially moved northwestward around the southwestern periphery of a ridge over Mexico . Convection continued to develop to the west of the center , and late on August 23 , a ship report confirmed the depression intensified Tropical Storm Julio . Initially , the persistent shear left the center partially exposed from the thunderstorm activity , though upper level conditions gradually became more favorable for strengthening . On August 24 , Tropical Storm Julio attained peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) as intense convection developed near the center . Shortly thereafter , the center became difficult to locate , and late on August 24 the storm moved ashore along the southwestern coast of the Baja California Peninsula . 
 Tropical Storm Julio quickly weakened over land , although it initially maintained strong convection near its center . By early on August 26 , however , the low @-@ level and upper @-@ level circulations separated , with the upper @-@ circulation continuing quickly northeastward into mainland Mexico ; the low @-@ level circulation slowed as it entered the Gulf of California , after having been separated from its deep convection . Later in the day , the NHC discontinued advisories after the storm failed to maintain enough organized convection to be considered a tropical cyclone . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Shortly before it was named , the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch in the state of Baja California Sur , from Santa Fe on the Pacific coast around the peninsula to Buenavista along the Gulf of California . About 24 hours prior to landfall , the watch was replaced with a warning from Santa Fe to San Evaristo , and the tropical storm watch was extended along both sides of the peninsula . Prior to it making landfall , more than 2 @,@ 500 families in susceptible areas left their homes . Officials opened several shelters in the area where the storm struck . 
 As Julio made landfall , it produced lightning and locally heavy rainfall , which left more than a dozen communities isolated due to flooding . The flooding damaged several houses and killed two people . Winds were generally light , although strong enough to damage a few electrical poles and small buildings . In nearby Sinaloa , rainfall from the storm led to an emergency evacuation of 500 residents . 
 Moisture from Julio developed thunderstorms across Arizona , including one near Chandler which produced winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) ; the storm damaged ten small planes at Chandler Municipal Airport , as well as a hangar . The damages at the airport were estimated at $ 1 million ( USD ) . The storms also dropped heavy rainfall , reaching over 1 inch ( 25 mm ) in Gilbert , which caused flooding on Interstate 17 . 
 = Hubble Space Telescope = 
 The Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) is a space telescope that was launched into low Earth orbit in 1990 , and remains in operation . Although not the first space telescope , Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile , and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy . The HST is named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble , and is one of NASA 's Great Observatories , along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory , the Chandra X @-@ ray Observatory , and the Spitzer Space Telescope . 
 With a 2 @.@ 4 @-@ meter ( 7 @.@ 9 ft ) mirror , Hubble 's four main instruments observe in the near ultraviolet , visible , and near infrared spectra . Hubble 's orbit outside the distortion of Earth 's atmosphere allows it to take extremely high @-@ resolution images , with substantially lower background light than ground @-@ based telescopes . Hubble has recorded some of the most detailed visible @-@ light images ever , allowing a deep view into space and time . Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics , such as accurately determining the rate of expansion of the universe . 
 The HST was built by the United States space agency NASA , with contributions from the European Space Agency . The Space Telescope Science Institute ( STScI ) selects Hubble 's targets and processes the resulting data , while the Goddard Space Flight Center controls the spacecraft . 
 Space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923 . Hubble was funded in the 1970s , with a proposed launch in 1983 , but the project was beset by technical delays , budget problems , and the Challenger disaster ( 1986 ) . When finally launched in 1990 , Hubble 's main mirror was found to have been ground incorrectly , compromising the telescope 's capabilities . The optics were corrected to their intended quality by a servicing mission in 1993 . 
 Hubble is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by astronauts . After launch by Space Shuttle Discovery in 1990 , four subsequent Space Shuttle missions repaired , upgraded , and replaced systems on the telescope . A fifth mission was canceled on safety grounds following the Columbia disaster ( 2003 ) . However , after spirited public discussion , NASA administrator Mike Griffin approved one final servicing mission , completed in 2009 . The telescope is operating as of 2016 , and could last until 2030 – 2040 . Its scientific successor , the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) , is scheduled for launch in 2018 .

 In 1923 , Hermann Oberth — considered a father of modern rocketry , along with Robert H. Goddard and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky — published Die <unk> zu den <unk> ( " The Rocket into Planetary Space " ) , which mentioned how a telescope could be propelled into Earth orbit by a rocket . 
 The history of the Hubble Space Telescope can be traced back as far as 1946 , to the astronomer Lyman Spitzer 's paper " Astronomical advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory " . In it , he discussed the two main advantages that a space @-@ based observatory would have over ground @-@ based telescopes . First , the angular resolution ( the smallest separation at which objects can be clearly distinguished ) would be limited only by diffraction , rather than by the turbulence in the atmosphere , which causes stars to twinkle , known to astronomers as seeing . At that time ground @-@ based telescopes were limited to resolutions of 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 0 arcseconds , compared to a theoretical diffraction @-@ limited resolution of about 0 @.@ 05 arcsec for a telescope with a mirror 2 @.@ 5 m in diameter . Second , a space @-@ based telescope could observe infrared and ultraviolet light , which are strongly absorbed by the atmosphere . 
 Spitzer devoted much of his career to pushing for the development of a space telescope . In 1962 , a report by the US National Academy of Sciences recommended the development of a space telescope as part of the space program , and in 1965 Spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given the task of defining scientific objectives for a large space telescope . 
 Space @-@ based astronomy had begun on a very small scale following World War II , as scientists made use of developments that had taken place in rocket technology . The first ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun was obtained in 1946 , and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) launched the Orbiting Solar Observatory ( OSO ) to obtain UV , X @-@ ray , and gamma @-@ ray spectra in 1962 . An orbiting solar telescope was launched in 1962 by the United Kingdom as part of the Ariel space program , and in 1966 NASA launched the first Orbiting Astronomical Observatory ( OAO ) mission . OAO @-@ 1 's battery failed after three days , terminating the mission . It was followed by OAO @-@ 2 , which carried out ultraviolet observations of stars and galaxies from its launch in 1968 until 1972 , well beyond its original planned lifetime of one year . 
 The OSO and OAO missions demonstrated the important role space @-@ based observations could play in astronomy , and in 1968 , NASA developed firm plans for a space @-@ based reflecting telescope with a mirror 3 m in diameter , known provisionally as the Large Orbiting Telescope or Large Space Telescope ( LST ) , with a launch slated for 1979 . These plans emphasized the need for manned maintenance missions to the telescope to ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life , and the concurrent development of plans for the reusable space shuttle indicated that the technology to allow this was soon to become available . 
 = = = Quest for funding = = = 
 The continuing success of the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal . In 1970 , NASA established two committees , one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project , and the other to determine the scientific goals of the mission . Once these had been established , the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument , which would be far more costly than any Earth @-@ based telescope . The U.S. Congress questioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced cuts in the budget for the planning stages , which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope . In 1974 , public spending cuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project . 
 In response to this , a nationwide lobbying effort was coordinated among astronomers . Many astronomers met congressmen and senators in person , and large scale letter @-@ writing campaigns were organized . The National Academy of Sciences published a report emphasizing the need for a space telescope , and eventually the Senate agreed to half of the budget that had originally been approved by Congress . 
 The funding issues led to something of a reduction in the scale of the project , with the proposed mirror diameter reduced from 3 m to 2 @.@ 4 m , both to cut costs and to allow a more compact and effective configuration for the telescope hardware . A proposed precursor 1 @.@ 5 m space telescope to test the systems to be used on the main satellite was dropped , and budgetary concerns also prompted collaboration with the European Space Agency . ESA agreed to provide funding and supply one of the first generation instruments for the telescope , as well as the solar cells that would power it , and staff to work on the telescope in the United States , in return for European astronomers being guaranteed at least 15 % of the observing time on the telescope . Congress eventually approved funding of US $ 36 million for 1978 , and the design of the LST began in earnest , aiming for a launch date of 1983 . In 1983 the telescope was named after Edwin Hubble , who made one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century when he discovered that the universe is expanding .

 Once the Space Telescope project had been given the go @-@ ahead , work on the program was divided among many institutions . Marshall Space Flight Center ( MSFC ) was given responsibility for the design , development , and construction of the telescope , while Goddard Space Flight Center was given overall control of the scientific instruments and ground @-@ control center for the mission . MSFC commissioned the optics company Perkin @-@ Elmer to design and build the Optical Telescope Assembly ( OTA ) and Fine Guidance Sensors for the space telescope . Lockheed was commissioned to construct and integrate the spacecraft in which the telescope would be housed . 
 = = = Optical Telescope Assembly ( OTA ) = = = 
 Optically , the HST is a Cassegrain reflector of Ritchey – Chrétien design , as are most large professional telescopes . This design , with two hyperbolic mirrors , is known for good imaging performance over a wide field of view , with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes that are hard to fabricate and test . The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance , and they were designed to exacting specifications . Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light , but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet ( shorter wavelengths ) and was specified to be diffraction limited to take full advantage of the space environment . Therefore , its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10 nanometers , or about 1 / 65 of the wavelength of red light . On the long wavelength end , the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind — for example , the mirrors are kept at stable ( and warm , about 15 ° C ) temperatures by heaters . This limits Hubble 's performance as an infrared telescope . 
 Perkin @-@ Elmer intended to use custom @-@ built and extremely sophisticated computer @-@ controlled polishing machines to grind the mirror to the required shape . However , in case their cutting @-@ edge technology ran into difficulties , NASA demanded that PE sub @-@ contract to Kodak to construct a back @-@ up mirror using traditional mirror @-@ polishing techniques . ( The team of Kodak and <unk> also bid on the original mirror polishing work . Their bid called for the two companies to double @-@ check each other 's work , which would have almost certainly caught the polishing error that later caused such problems . ) The Kodak mirror is now on permanent display at the National Air and Space Museum . An <unk> mirror built as part of the effort is now used in the 2 @.@ 4 m telescope at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory . 
 Construction of the Perkin @-@ Elmer mirror began in 1979 , starting with a blank manufactured by Corning from their ultra @-@ low expansion glass . To keep the mirror 's weight to a minimum it consisted of top and bottom plates , each one inch ( 25 @.@ 4 mm ) thick , sandwiching a honeycomb lattice . Perkin @-@ Elmer simulated microgravity by supporting the mirror from the back with 130 rods that exerted varying amounts of force . This ensured that the mirror 's final shape would be correct and to specification when finally deployed . Mirror polishing continued until May 1981 . NASA reports at the time questioned Perkin @-@ Elmer 's managerial structure , and the polishing began to slip behind schedule and over budget . To save money , NASA halted work on the back @-@ up mirror and put the launch date of the telescope back to October 1984 . The mirror was completed by the end of 1981 ; it was washed using 2 @,@ 400 gallons ( 9 @,@ 100 L ) of hot , deionized water and then received a reflective coating of 65 nm @-@ thick aluminum and a protective coating of 25 nm @-@ thick magnesium fluoride . 
 Doubts continued to be expressed about Perkin @-@ Elmer 's competence on a project of this importance , as their budget and timescale for producing the rest of the OTA continued to inflate . In response to a schedule described as " unsettled and changing daily " , NASA postponed the launch date of the telescope until April 1985 . Perkin @-@ Elmer 's schedules continued to slip at a rate of about one month per quarter , and at times delays reached one day for each day of work . NASA was forced to postpone the launch date until March and then September 1986 . By this time , the total project budget had risen to US $ 1 @.@ 175 billion . 
 = = = Spacecraft systems = = = 
 The spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge . It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight into the darkness of Earth 's shadow , which would cause major changes in temperature , while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope . A shroud of multi @-@ layer insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable , and surrounds a light aluminum shell in which the telescope and instruments sit . Within the shell , a graphite @-@ epoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned . Because graphite composites are hygroscopic , there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed 's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space ; resulting in the telescope 's instruments being covered by ice . To reduce that risk , a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space . 
 While construction of the spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments would be housed proceeded somewhat more smoothly than the construction of the OTA , Lockheed still experienced some budget and schedule slippage , and by the summer of 1985 , construction of the spacecraft was 30 % over budget and three months behind schedule . An MSFC report said that Lockheed tended to rely on NASA directions rather than take their own initiative in the construction .

 The two initial , primary computers on the HST were the 1 @.@ 25 MHz DF @-@ 224 system , built by Rockwell Autonetics , which contained three redundant CPUs , and two redundant <unk> @-@ 1 ( NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer , Model 1 ) systems , developed by Westinghouse and <unk> using diode @-@ transistor logic ( <unk> ) . A co @-@ processor for the DF @-@ 224 was added during Servicing Mission 1 in 1993 , which consisted of two redundant strings of an Intel @-@ based <unk> processor with an <unk> math co @-@ processor . The DF @-@ 224 and its 386 co @-@ processor were replaced by a 25 MHz Intel @-@ based <unk> processor system during Servicing Mission 3A in 1999 . 
 Additionally , some of the science instruments and components had their own embedded microprocessor @-@ based control systems . The <unk> ( Multiple Access <unk> ) components , MAT @-@ 1 and MAT @-@ 2 , utilize Hughes Aircraft <unk> microprocessors . The Wide Field and Planetary Camera ( WFPC ) also utilized an RCA 1802 microprocessor ( or possibly the older 1801 version ) . The WFPC @-@ 1 was replaced by the WFPC @-@ 2 during Servicing Mission 1 in 1993 , which was then replaced by the Wide Field Camera 3 ( WFC3 ) during Servicing Mission 4 in 2009 .

 When launched , the HST carried five scientific instruments : the Wide Field and Planetary Camera ( WF / PC ) , Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph ( GHRS ) , High Speed Photometer ( HSP ) , Faint Object Camera ( FOC ) and the Faint Object Spectrograph ( FOS ) . WF / PC was a high @-@ resolution imaging device primarily intended for optical observations . It was built by NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , and incorporated a set of 48 filters isolating spectral lines of particular astrophysical interest . The instrument contained eight charge @-@ coupled device ( CCD ) chips divided between two cameras , each using four CCDs . Each CCD has a resolution of 0 @.@ 64 megapixels . The " wide field camera " ( WFC ) covered a large angular field at the expense of resolution , while the " planetary camera " ( PC ) took images at a longer effective focal length than the WF chips , giving it a greater magnification . 
 The GHRS was a spectrograph designed to operate in the ultraviolet . It was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center and could achieve a spectral resolution of 90 @,@ 000 . Also optimized for ultraviolet observations were the FOC and FOS , which were capable of the highest spatial resolution of any instruments on Hubble . Rather than CCDs these three instruments used photon @-@ counting <unk> as their detectors . The FOC was constructed by ESA , while the University of California , San Diego , and Martin Marietta Corporation built the FOS . 
 The final instrument was the HSP , designed and built at the University of Wisconsin – Madison . It was optimized for visible and ultraviolet light observations of variable stars and other astronomical objects varying in brightness . It could take up to 100 @,@ 000 measurements per second with a photometric accuracy of about 2 % or better . 
 HST 's guidance system can also be used as a scientific instrument . Its three Fine Guidance Sensors ( FGS ) are primarily used to keep the telescope accurately pointed during an observation , but can also be used to carry out extremely accurate astrometry ; measurements accurate to within 0 @.@ 0003 arcseconds have been achieved . 
 = = = Ground support = = = 
 The Space Telescope Science Institute ( STScI ) is responsible for the scientific operation of the telescope and the delivery of data products to astronomers . STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy ( AURA ) and is physically located in Baltimore , Maryland on the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University , one of the 39 US universities and seven international affiliates that make up the AURA consortium . STScI was established in 1981 after something of a power struggle between NASA and the scientific community at large . NASA had wanted to keep this function in @-@ house , but scientists wanted it to be based in an academic establishment . The Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility ( ST @-@ <unk> ) , established at <unk> bei München near Munich in 1984 , provided similar support for European astronomers until 2011 , when these activities were moved to the European Space Astronomy Centre . 
 One rather complex task that falls to STScI is scheduling observations for the telescope . Hubble is in a low @-@ Earth orbit to enable servicing missions , but this means that most astronomical targets are occulted by the Earth for slightly less than half of each orbit . Observations cannot take place when the telescope passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly due to elevated radiation levels , and there are also sizable exclusion zones around the Sun ( precluding observations of Mercury ) , Moon and Earth . The solar avoidance angle is about 50 ° , to keep sunlight from illuminating any part of the OTA . Earth and Moon avoidance keeps bright light out of the <unk> , and keeps scattered light from entering the instruments . If the <unk> are turned off , however , the Moon and Earth can be observed . Earth observations were used very early in the program to generate flat @-@ fields for the <unk> instrument . There is a so @-@ called continuous viewing zone ( CVZ ) , at roughly 90 ° to the plane of Hubble 's orbit , in which targets are not occulted for long periods . Due to the precession of the orbit , the location of the CVZ moves slowly over a period of eight weeks . Because the limb of the Earth is always within about 30 ° of regions within the CVZ , the brightness of scattered earthshine may be elevated for long periods during CVZ observations . 
 Hubble orbits in the upper atmosphere at an altitude of approximately 569 kilometers ( 354 mi ) and an inclination of 28 @.@ 5 ° . The position along its orbit changes over time in a way that is not accurately predictable . The density of the upper atmosphere varies according to many factors , and this means that Hubble 's predicted position for six weeks ' time could be in error by up to 4 @,@ 000 km ( 2 @,@ 500 mi ) . Observation schedules are typically finalized only a few days in advance , as a longer lead time would mean there was a chance that the target would be unobservable by the time it was due to be observed . 
 Engineering support for HST is provided by NASA and contractor personnel at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland , 48 km ( 30 mi ) south of the STScI . Hubble 's operation is monitored 24 hours per day by four teams of flight controllers who make up Hubble 's Flight Operations Team . 
 = = = Challenger disaster , delays , and eventual launch = = = 
 By early 1986 , the planned launch date of October that year looked feasible , but the Challenger accident brought the U.S. space program to a halt , grounding the Space Shuttle fleet and forcing the launch of Hubble to be postponed for several years . The telescope had to be kept in a clean room , powered up and purged with nitrogen , until a launch could be rescheduled . This costly situation ( about $ 6 million per month ) pushed the overall costs of the project even higher . This delay did allow time for engineers to perform extensive tests , swap out a possibly failure @-@ prone battery , and make other improvements . Furthermore , the ground software needed to control Hubble was not ready in 1986 , and in fact was barely ready by the 1990 launch . 
 Eventually , following the resumption of shuttle flights in 1988 , the launch of the telescope was scheduled for 1990 . On April 24 , 1990 , shuttle mission STS @-@ 31 saw Discovery launch the telescope successfully into its planned orbit . 
 From its original total cost estimate of about US $ 400 million , the telescope had by now cost over $ 2 @.@ 5 billion to construct . Hubble 's cumulative costs were estimated to be about US $ 10 billion in 2010 , twenty years after launch . 
 = = Flawed mirror = = 
 Within weeks of the launch of the telescope , the returned images indicated a serious problem with the optical system . Although the first images appeared to be sharper than those of ground @-@ based telescopes , Hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected . Images of point sources spread out over a radius of more than one arcsecond , instead of having a point spread function ( PSF ) concentrated within a circle 0 @.@ 1 arcsec in diameter as had been specified in the design criteria . 
 Analysis of the flawed images showed that the cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been ground to the wrong shape . Although it was probably the most precisely figured mirror ever made , with variations from the prescribed curve of only 10 nanometers , at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2 @,@ 200 nanometers ( 2 @.@ 2 micrometers ) . This difference was catastrophic , introducing severe spherical aberration , a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center . 
 The effect of the mirror flaw on scientific observations depended on the particular observation — the core of the <unk> PSF was sharp enough to permit high @-@ resolution observations of bright objects , and spectroscopy of point sources was only affected through a sensitivity loss . However , the loss of light to the large , out of focus halo severely reduced the usefulness of the telescope for faint objects or high @-@ contrast imaging . This meant that nearly all of the cosmological programs were essentially impossible , since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects . NASA and the telescope became the butt of many jokes , and the project was popularly regarded as a white elephant . For instance , in the 1991 comedy The Naked Gun 2 ½ : The Smell of Fear , Hubble was pictured with the Titanic , the Hindenburg , and the Edsel . Nonetheless , during the first three years of the Hubble mission , before the optical corrections , the telescope still carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets . The error was well characterized and stable , enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution . 
 = = = Origin of the problem = = = 
 A commission headed by Lew Allen , director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , was established to determine how the error could have arisen . The Allen Commission found that the main null corrector , a testing device used to achieve a properly shaped non @-@ spherical mirror , had been incorrectly assembled — one lens was out of position by 1 @.@ 3 mm . During the initial grinding and polishing of the mirror , Perkin @-@ Elmer analyzed its surface with two conventional null correctors . However , for the final manufacturing step ( figuring ) , they switched to a custom @-@ built null corrector , designed explicitly to meet very strict tolerances . The incorrect assembly of the device resulted in the mirror being ground very precisely but to the wrong shape . There was one later opportunity to catch the error , since for technical reasons a few of the final tests needed to use the two conventional null correctors . These tests correctly reported spherical aberration , but were dismissed since the reflective null corrector was considered more accurate . 
 The commission blamed the failings primarily on Perkin @-@ Elmer . Relations between NASA and the optics company had been severely strained during the telescope construction , due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns . NASA found that Perkin @-@ Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately , did not assign its best optical scientists to the project ( as it had for the prototype ) , and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror . While the commission heavily criticized Perkin @-@ Elmer for these managerial failings , NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings , such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument . 
 = = = Design of a solution = = = 
 The design of the telescope had always incorporated servicing missions , and astronomers immediately began to seek potential solutions to the problem that could be applied at the first servicing mission , scheduled for 1993 . While Kodak had ground a back @-@ up mirror for Hubble , it would have been impossible to replace the mirror in orbit , and too expensive and time @-@ consuming to bring the telescope back to Earth for a refit . Instead , the fact that the mirror had been ground so precisely to the wrong shape led to the design of new optical components with exactly the same error but in the opposite sense , to be added to the telescope at the servicing mission , effectively acting as " spectacles " to correct the spherical aberration . 
 The first step was a precise characterization of the error in the main mirror . Working backwards from images of point sources , astronomers determined that the conic constant of the mirror as built was − 1 @.@ <unk> ± 0 @.@ 0002 , instead of the intended − 1 @.@ <unk> . The same number was also derived by analyzing the null corrector used by Perkin @-@ Elmer to figure the mirror , as well as by analyzing interferograms obtained during ground testing of the mirror . 
 Because of the way the HST 's instruments were designed , two different sets of correctors were required . The design of the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 , already planned to replace the existing WF / PC , included relay mirrors to direct light onto the four separate charge @-@ coupled device ( CCD ) chips making up its two cameras . An inverse error built into their surfaces could completely cancel the aberration of the primary . However , the other instruments lacked any intermediate surfaces that could be figured in this way , and so required an external correction device . 
 The Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement ( COSTAR ) system was designed to correct the spherical aberration for light focused at the FOC , FOS , and GHRS . It consists of two mirrors in the light path with one ground to correct the aberration . To fit the COSTAR system onto the telescope , one of the other instruments had to be removed , and astronomers selected the High Speed Photometer to be sacrificed . By 2002 , all of the original instruments requiring COSTAR had been replaced by instruments with their own corrective optics . COSTAR was removed and returned to Earth in 2009 where it is exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum . The area previously used by COSTAR is now occupied by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph . 
 = = Servicing missions and new instruments = = 
 Hubble was designed to accommodate regular servicing and equipment upgrades . Five servicing missions ( SM 1 , 2 , 3A , 3B , and 4 ) were flown by NASA space shuttles , the first in December 1993 and the last in May 2009 . Servicing missions were delicate operations that began with maneuvering to intercept the telescope in orbit and carefully retrieving it with the shuttle 's mechanical arm . The necessary work was then carried out in multiple tethered spacewalks over a period of four to five days . After a visual inspection of the telescope , astronauts conducted repairs , replaced failed or degraded components , upgraded equipment , and installed new instruments . Once work was completed , the telescope was redeployed , typically after boosting to a higher orbit to address the orbital decay caused by atmospheric drag . 
 = = = Servicing Mission 1 = = = 
 After the problems with Hubble 's mirror were discovered , the first servicing mission assumed greater importance , as the astronauts would need to do extensive work to install corrective optics . The seven astronauts for the mission were trained to use about a hundred specialized tools . <unk> flew aboard Endeavour in December 1993 , and involved installation of several instruments and other equipment over ten days . 
 Most importantly , the High Speed Photometer was replaced with the COSTAR corrective optics package , and WFPC was replaced with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 ( WFPC2 ) with an internal optical correction system . The solar arrays and their drive electronics were also replaced , as well as four gyroscopes in the telescope pointing system , two electrical control units and other electrical components , and two magnetometers . The onboard computers were upgraded with added <unk> , and Hubble 's orbit was boosted . 
 On January 13 , 1994 , NASA declared the mission a complete success and showed the first sharper images . At the time , the mission was one of the most complex , involving five long extra @-@ vehicular activity periods . Its success was a boon for NASA , as well as for the astronomers with a more capable space telescope . 
 = = = Servicing Mission 2 = = = 
 Servicing Mission 2 , flown by Discovery in February 1997 , replaced the GHRS and the FOS with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph ( STIS ) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi @-@ Object Spectrometer ( NICMOS ) , replaced an Engineering and Science Tape Recorder with a new Solid State Recorder , and repaired thermal insulation . NICMOS contained a heat sink of solid nitrogen to reduce the thermal noise from the instrument , but shortly after it was installed , an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle . This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4 @.@ 5 years to about 2 years . 
 = = = Servicing Mission 3A = = = 
 Servicing Mission 3A , flown by Discovery , took place in December 1999 , and was a split @-@ off from Servicing Mission 3 after three of the six onboard gyroscopes had failed . The fourth failed a few weeks before the mission , rendering the telescope incapable of performing scientific observations . The mission replaced all six gyroscopes , replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor and the computer , installed a Voltage / temperature Improvement Kit ( <unk> ) to prevent battery overcharging , and replaced thermal insulation blankets . The new computer is 20 times faster , with six times more memory , than the DF @-@ 224 it replaced . It increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from the ground to the spacecraft , and saves money by allowing the use of modern programming languages . 
 = = = Servicing Mission 3B = = = 
 Servicing Mission 3B flown by Columbia in March 2002 saw the installation of a new instrument , with the FOC ( which , except for the Fine Guidance Sensors when used for astrometry , was the last of the original instruments ) being replaced by the Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) . This meant that COSTAR was no longer required , since all new instruments had built @-@ in correction for the main mirror aberration . The mission also revived NICMOS by installing a closed @-@ cycle cooler and replaced the solar arrays for the second time , providing 30 percent more power . 
 = = = Servicing Mission 4 = = = 
 Plans called for Hubble to be serviced in February 2005 , but the Columbia disaster in 2003 , in which the orbiter disintegrated on re @-@ entry into the atmosphere , had wide @-@ ranging effects on the Hubble program . NASA Administrator Sean O 'Keefe decided that all future shuttle missions had to be able to reach the safe haven of the International Space Station should in @-@ flight problems develop . As no shuttles were capable of reaching both HST and the ISS during the same mission , future manned service missions were canceled . This decision was assailed by numerous astronomers , who felt that Hubble was valuable enough to merit the human risk . HST 's planned successor , the James Webb Telescope ( JWST ) , is not expected to launch until at least 2018 . A gap in space @-@ observing capabilities between a decommissioning of Hubble and the commissioning of a successor is of major concern to many astronomers , given the significant scientific impact of HST . The consideration that JWST will not be located in low Earth orbit , and therefore cannot be easily upgraded or repaired in the event of an early failure , only makes these concerns more acute . On the other hand , many astronomers felt strongly that the servicing of Hubble should not take place if the expense were to come from the JWST budget . 
 In January 2004 , O 'Keefe said he would review his decision to cancel the final servicing mission to HST due to public outcry and requests from Congress for NASA to look for a way to save it . The National Academy of Sciences convened an official panel , which recommended in July 2004 that the HST should be preserved despite the apparent risks . Their report urged " NASA should take no actions that would preclude a space shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope " . In August 2004 , O 'Keefe asked Goddard Space Flight Center to prepare a detailed proposal for a robotic service mission . These plans were later canceled , the robotic mission being described as " not feasible " . In late 2004 , several Congressional members , led by Senator Barbara Mikulski , held public hearings and carried on a fight with much public support ( including thousands of letters from school children across the country ) to get the Bush Administration and NASA to reconsider the decision to drop plans for a Hubble rescue mission . 
 The nomination in April 2005 of a new NASA Administrator with an engineering rather than accounting background , Michael D. Griffin , changed the situation , as Griffin stated he would consider a manned servicing mission . Soon after his appointment Griffin authorized Goddard to proceed with preparations for a manned Hubble maintenance flight , saying he would make the final decision after the next two shuttle missions . In October 2006 Griffin gave the final go @-@ ahead , and the 11 @-@ day mission by Atlantis was scheduled for October 2008 . Hubble 's main data @-@ handling unit failed in September 2008 , halting all reporting of scientific data until its back @-@ up was brought online on October 25 , 2008 . Since a failure of the backup unit would leave the HST helpless , the service mission was postponed to incorporate a replacement for the primary unit . 
 Servicing Mission 4 , flown by Atlantis in May 2009 , was the last scheduled shuttle mission for HST . SM4 installed the replacement data @-@ handling unit , repaired the ACS and STIS systems , installed improved nickel hydrogen batteries , and replaced other components . SM4 also installed two new observation instruments — Wide Field Camera 3 ( WFC3 ) and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph ( COS ) — and the Soft Capture and Rendezvous System , which will enable the future rendezvous , capture , and safe disposal of Hubble by either a crewed or robotic mission . Except for the High Resolution Channel of the ACS which was unable to be repaired , the work accomplished during SM4 rendered the telescope fully functional , and it remains so as of 2015 . 
 = = Major projects = = 
 Since the start of the program , a number of research projects have been carried out , some of them almost solely with Hubble , others coordinated facilities such as Chandra X @-@ ray Observatory and ESO 's Very Large Telescope . Although the Hubble observatory is nearing the end of its life , there are still major projects scheduled for it . One example is the upcoming Frontier Fields program , inspired by the results of Hubble 's deep observation of the galaxy cluster Abell 1689 . 
 = = = Cosmic Assembly Near @-@ infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey = = = 
 In an August 2013 press release , CANDELS was referred to as " the largest project in the history of Hubble " . The survey " aims to explore galactic evolution in the early Universe , and the very first seeds of cosmic structure at less than one billion years after the Big Bang . " The CANDELS project site describes the survey 's goals as the following : 
 The Cosmic Assembly Near @-@ IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey is designed to document the ﬁrst third of galactic evolution from z = 8 to 1 @.@ 5 via deep imaging of more than 250 @,@ 000 galaxies with WFC3 / IR and ACS . It will also find the first Type Ia SNe beyond z > 1 @.@ 5 and establish their accuracy as standard candles for cosmology . Five premier multi @-@ wavelength sky regions are selected ; each has multi @-@ wavelength data from Spitzer and other facilities , and has extensive spectroscopy of the brighter galaxies . The use of <unk> widely separated <unk> mitigates cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to 109 solar masses out to z ~ 8 . 
 = = = Frontier Fields program = = = 
 The program , officially named " Hubble Deep Fields Initiative 2012 " , is aimed to advance the knowledge of early galaxy formation by studying high @-@ redshift galaxies in blank fields with the help of gravitational lensing to see the " faintest galaxies in the distant universe . " The Frontier Fields web page describes the goals of the program being : 
 to reveal hitherto inaccessible populations of z = 5 – 10 galaxies that are 10 to 50 times fainter intrinsically than any presently known 
 to solidify our understanding of the stellar masses and star formation histories of sub @-@ L * galaxies at the earliest times 
 to provide the first statistically meaningful morphological characterization of star forming galaxies at z > 5 
 to find z > 8 galaxies stretched out enough by cluster lensing to discern internal structure and / or magnified enough by cluster lensing for spectroscopic follow @-@ up . 
 = = Public use = = 
 Anyone can apply for time on the telescope ; there are no restrictions on nationality or academic affiliation , but funding for analysis is only available to US institutions . Competition for time on the telescope is intense , with about one @-@ fifth of the proposals submitted in each cycle earning time on the schedule . 
 Calls for proposals are issued roughly annually , with time allocated for a cycle lasting about one year . Proposals are divided into several categories ; " general observer " proposals are the most common , covering routine observations . " Snapshot observations " are those in which targets require only 45 minutes or less of telescope time , including overheads such as acquiring the target . Snapshot observations are used to fill in gaps in the telescope schedule that cannot be filled by regular GO programs . 
 Astronomers may make " Target of Opportunity " proposals , in which observations are scheduled if a transient event covered by the proposal occurs during the scheduling cycle . In addition , up to 10 % of the telescope time is designated " director 's discretionary " ( DD ) time . Astronomers can apply to use DD time at any time of year , and it is typically awarded for study of unexpected transient phenomena such as supernovae . 
 Other uses of DD time have included the observations that led to views of the Hubble Deep Field and Hubble Ultra Deep Field , and in the first four cycles of telescope time , observations that were carried out by amateur astronomers . 
 = = = Amateur observations = = = 
 The first director of STScI , Riccardo Giacconi , announced in 1986 that he intended to devote some of his director discretionary time to allowing amateur astronomers to use the telescope . The total time to be allocated was only a few hours per cycle but excited great interest among amateur astronomers . 
 Proposals for amateur time were stringently reviewed by a committee of amateur astronomers , and time was awarded only to proposals that were deemed to have genuine scientific merit , did not duplicate proposals made by professionals , and required the unique capabilities of the space telescope . Thirteen amateur astronomers were awarded time on the telescope , with observations being carried out between 1990 and 1997 . One such study was " Transition Comets — UV Search for OH " . The very first proposal , " A Hubble Space Telescope Study of <unk> <unk> and Albedo Changes on Io " , was published in Icarus , a journal devoted to solar system studies . A second study from another group of amateurs was also published in Icarus . After that time , however , budget reductions at STScI made the support of work by amateur astronomers untenable , and no additional amateur programs have been carried out . 
 = = = 20th and 25th anniversaries = = = 
 The Hubble Space Telescope celebrated its 20th anniversary in space on April 24 , 2010 . To commemorate the occasion , NASA , ESA , and the Space Telescope Science Institute ( STScI ) released an image from the Carina Nebula . 
 To commemorate Hubble 's 25th anniversary in space on April 24 , 2015 , STScI released images of the Westerlund 2 cluster , located about 20 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ( 6 @,@ 100 pc ) away in the constellation Carina , through its Hubble 25 website . The European Space Agency created a dedicated 25th anniversary page on its website . 
 = = Scientific results = = 
 = = = Key projects = = = 
 In the early 1980s , NASA and STScI convened four panels to discuss Key Projects . These were projects that were both scientifically important and would require significant telescope time , which would be explicitly dedicated to each project . This guaranteed that these particular projects would be completed early , in case the telescope failed sooner than expected . The panels identified three such projects : 1 ) a study of the nearby intergalactic medium using quasar absorption lines to determine the properties of the intergalactic medium and the gaseous content of galaxies and groups of galaxies ; 2 ) a medium deep survey using the Wide Field Camera to take data whenever one of the other instruments was being used and 3 ) a project to determine the Hubble Constant within ten percent by reducing the errors , both external and internal , in the calibration of the distance scale . 
 = = = Important discoveries = = = 
 Hubble has helped resolve some long @-@ standing problems in astronomy , as well as raising new questions . Some results have required new theories to explain them . Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before , and thus constrain the value of the Hubble constant , the measure of the rate at which the universe is expanding , which is also related to its age . Before the launch of HST , estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50 % , but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ± 10 % , which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble 's launch using other techniques . The estimated age is now about 13 @.@ 7 billion years , but before the Hubble Telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years . 
 While Hubble helped to refine estimates of the age of the universe , it also cast doubt on theories about its future . Astronomers from the High @-@ z Supernova Search Team and the Supernova Cosmology Project used ground @-@ based telescopes and HST to observe distant supernovae and uncovered evidence that , far from decelerating under the influence of gravity , the expansion of the universe may in fact be accelerating . The cause of this acceleration remains poorly understood ; the most common cause attributed is dark energy . 
 The high @-@ resolution spectra and images provided by the HST have been especially well @-@ suited to establishing the prevalence of black holes in the nuclei of nearby galaxies . While it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black holes would be found at the centers of some galaxies , and astronomers in the 1980s identified a number of good black hole candidates , work conducted with Hubble shows that black holes are probably common to the centers of all galaxies . The Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related . The legacy of the Hubble programs on black holes in galaxies is thus to demonstrate a deep connection between galaxies and their central black holes . 
 The collision of Comet Shoemaker @-@ Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 was fortuitously timed for astronomers , coming just a few months after Servicing Mission 1 had restored Hubble 's optical performance . Hubble images of the planet were sharper than any taken since the passage of Voyager 2 in 1979 , and were crucial in studying the dynamics of the collision of a comet with Jupiter , an event believed to occur once every few centuries . 
 Other discoveries made with Hubble data include proto @-@ planetary disks ( proplyds ) in the Orion Nebula ; evidence for the presence of extrasolar planets around Sun @-@ like stars ; and the optical counterparts of the still @-@ mysterious gamma ray bursts . HST has also been used to study objects in the outer reaches of the Solar System , including the dwarf planets Pluto and Eris . 
 A unique window on the Universe enabled by Hubble are the Hubble Deep Field , Hubble Ultra @-@ Deep Field , and Hubble Extreme Deep Field images , which used Hubble 's unmatched sensitivity at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky that are the deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths . The images reveal galaxies billions of light years away , and have generated a wealth of scientific papers , providing a new window on the early Universe . The Wide Field Camera 3 improved the view of these fields in the infrared and ultraviolet , supporting the discovery of some of the most distant objects yet discovered , such as <unk> @-@ JD . 
 The non @-@ standard object SCP <unk> was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in February 2006 . During June and July 2012 , US astronomers using Hubble discovered a tiny fifth moon moving around icy Pluto . 
 In March 2015 , researchers announced that measurements of aurorae around Ganymede revealed that the moon has a subsurface ocean . Using Hubble to study the motion of its aurorae , the researchers determined that a large saltwater ocean was helping to suppress the interaction between Jupiter 's magnetic field and that of Ganymede . The ocean is estimated to be 100 km ( 60 mi ) deep , trapped beneath a 150 km ( 90 mi ) ice crust . 
 On December 11 , 2015 , Hubble captured an image of the first @-@ ever predicted reappearance of a supernova , dubbed " <unk> " , which was calculated using different mass models of a galaxy cluster whose gravity is warping the supernova 's light . The supernova was previously seen in November 2014 behind galaxy cluster MACS <unk> + <unk> as part of Hubble 's Frontier Fields program . Astronomers spotted four separate images of the supernova in an arrangement known as an Einstein Cross . The light from the cluster has taken about five billion years to reach Earth , though the supernova exploded some 10 billion years ago . The detection of <unk> 's reappearance served as a unique opportunity for astronomers to test their models of how mass , especially dark matter , is distributed within this galaxy cluster . 
 On March 3 , 2016 , researchers using Hubble data announced the discovery of the farthest known galaxy to date : GN @-@ z11 . The Hubble observations occurred on February 11 , 2015 , and April 3 , 2015 , as part of the CANDELS / <unk> @-@ North surveys . 
 = = = Impact on astronomy = = = 
 Many objective measures show the positive impact of Hubble data on astronomy . Over 9 @,@ 000 papers based on Hubble data have been published in peer @-@ reviewed journals , and countless more have appeared in conference proceedings . Looking at papers several years after their publication , about one @-@ third of all astronomy papers have no citations , while only 2 % of papers based on Hubble data have no citations . On average , a paper based on Hubble data receives about twice as many citations as papers based on non @-@ Hubble data . Of the 200 papers published each year that receive the most citations , about 10 % are based on Hubble data . 
 Although the HST has clearly helped astronomical research , its financial cost has been large . A study on the relative astronomical benefits of different sizes of telescopes found that while papers based on HST data generate 15 times as many citations as a 4 m ( 13 ft ) ground @-@ based telescope such as the William Herschel Telescope , the HST costs about 100 times as much to build and maintain . 
 Deciding between building ground- versus space @-@ based telescopes is complex . Even before Hubble was launched , specialized ground @-@ based techniques such as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher @-@ resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve , though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble . Since then , advances in adaptive optics have extended the high @-@ resolution imaging capabilities of ground @-@ based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects . The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked . In the visible bands , adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view , whereas HST can conduct high @-@ resolution optical imaging over a wide field . Only a small fraction of astronomical objects are accessible to high @-@ resolution ground @-@ based imaging ; in contrast Hubble can perform high @-@ resolution observations of any part of the night sky , and on objects that are extremely faint .

 = = = Transmission to Earth = = = 
 Hubble data was initially stored on the spacecraft . When launched , the storage facilities were old @-@ fashioned reel @-@ to @-@ reel tape recorders , but these were replaced by solid state data storage facilities during servicing missions 2 and 3A . About twice daily , the Hubble Space Telescope radios data to a satellite in the geosynchronous Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System ( <unk> ) , which then downlinks the science data to one of two 60 @-@ foot ( 18 @-@ meter ) diameter high @-@ gain microwave antennas located at the White Sands Test Facility in White Sands , New Mexico . From there they are sent to the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center , and finally to the Space Telescope Science Institute for archiving . Each week , HST downlinks approximately 140 gigabytes of data . 
 = = = Color images = = = 
 All images from Hubble are monochromatic grayscale , in which its cameras incorporate a variety of filters each sensitive to specific wavelengths of light . Color images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters . This process can also create false @-@ color versions of images including infrared and ultraviolet channels , where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue . 
 = = = Archives = = = 
 All Hubble data is eventually made available via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes at STScI , CADC and ESA / ESAC . Data is usually proprietary — available only to the principal investigator ( PI ) and astronomers designated by the PI — for one year after being taken . The PI can apply to the director of the STScI to extend or reduce the proprietary period in some circumstances . 
 Observations made on Director 's Discretionary Time are exempt from the proprietary period , and are released to the public immediately . Calibration data such as flat fields and dark frames are also publicly available straight away . All data in the archive is in the <unk> format , which is suitable for astronomical analysis but not for public use . The Hubble Heritage Project processes and releases to the public a small selection of the most striking images in JPEG and TIFF formats . 
 = = = Pipeline reduction = = = 
 Astronomical data taken with CCDs must undergo several calibration steps before they are suitable for astronomical analysis . STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically <unk> data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available . This ' on @-@ the @-@ fly ' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned . The process by which data are calibrated automatically is known as ' pipeline reduction ' , and is increasingly common at major observatories . Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally . This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used . 
 = = = Data analysis = = = 
 Hubble data can be analyzed using many different packages . STScI maintains the custom @-@ made Space Telescope Science Data Analysis System ( <unk> ) software , which contains all the programs needed to run pipeline reduction on raw data files , as well as many other astronomical image processing tools , tailored to the requirements of Hubble data . The software runs as a module of <unk> , a popular astronomical data reduction program . 
 = = Outreach activities = = 
 It has always been important for the Space Telescope to capture the public 's imagination , given the considerable contribution of taxpayers to its construction and operational costs . After the difficult early years when the faulty mirror severely dented Hubble 's reputation with the public , the first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as the corrected optics produced numerous remarkable images . 
 Several initiatives have helped to keep the public informed about Hubble activities . 
 In the United States , outreach efforts are coordinated by the Space Telescope Science Institute ( STScI ) Office for Public Outreach , which was established in 2000 to ensure that U.S. taxpayers saw the benefits of their investment in the space telescope program . To that end , STScI operates the <unk> website . The Hubble Heritage Project , operating out of the STScI , provides the public with high @-@ quality images of the most interesting and striking objects observed . The Heritage team is composed of amateur and professional astronomers , as well as people with backgrounds outside astronomy , and emphasizes the aesthetic nature of Hubble images . The Heritage Project is granted a small amount of time to observe objects which , for scientific reasons , may not have images taken at enough wavelengths to construct a full @-@ color image . 
 Since 1999 , the leading Hubble outreach group in Europe has been the Hubble European Space Agency Information Centre ( HEIC ) . This office was established at the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility in Munich , Germany . HEIC 's mission is to fulfill HST outreach and education tasks for the European Space Agency . The work is centered on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble results and images . These are often European in origin , and so increase awareness of both ESA 's Hubble share ( 15 % ) and the contribution of European scientists to the observatory . ESA produces educational material , including a <unk> series called <unk> designed to share world @-@ class scientific news with the public . 
 The Hubble Space Telescope has won two Space Achievement Awards from the Space Foundation , for its outreach activities , in 2001 and 2010 . 
 There is a replica of the Hubble Space Telescope on the courthouse lawn in Marshfield , Missouri , the hometown of namesake Edwin P. Hubble . 
 = = Future = = 
 = = = Equipment failure = = = 
 Past servicing missions have exchanged old instruments for new ones , both avoiding failure and making possible new types of science . Without servicing missions , all of the instruments will eventually fail . In August 2004 , the power system of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph ( STIS ) failed , rendering the instrument inoperable . The electronics had originally been fully redundant , but the first set of electronics failed in May 2001 . This power supply was fixed during servicing mission 4 in May 2009 . Similarly , the Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) main camera primary electronics failed in June 2006 , and the power supply for the backup electronics failed on January 27 , 2007 . Only the instrument 's Solar Blind Channel ( SBC ) was operable using the side @-@ 1 electronics . A new power supply for the wide angle channel was added during SM 4 , but quick tests revealed this did not help the high resolution channel . 
 HST uses gyroscopes to stabilize itself in orbit and point accurately and steadily at astronomical targets . Normally , three gyroscopes are required for operation ; observations are still possible with two , but the area of sky that can be viewed would be somewhat restricted , and observations requiring very accurate pointing are more difficult . There are further contingency plans for observations with just one gyro , but if all gyros fail , continued scientific observations will not be possible . In 2005 , it was decided to switch to two @-@ gyroscope mode for regular telescope operations as a means of extending the lifetime of the mission . The switch to this mode was made in August 2005 , leaving Hubble with two gyroscopes in use , two on backup , and two inoperable . One more gyro failed in 2007 . By the time of the final repair mission , during which all six gyros were replaced ( with two new pairs and one refurbished pair ) , only three gyros were still working . Engineers are confident that they have identified the root causes of the gyro failures , and the new models should be much more reliable . 
 = = = Orbital decay = = = 
 Hubble orbits the Earth in the extremely tenuous upper atmosphere , and over time its orbit decays due to drag . If it is not re @-@ boosted , it will re @-@ enter the Earth 's atmosphere within some decades , with the exact date depending on how active the Sun is and its impact on the upper atmosphere . If Hubble were to descend in a completely uncontrolled re @-@ entry , parts of the main mirror and its support structure would probably survive , leaving the potential for damage or even human fatalities . In 2013 , deputy project manager James <unk> projected that Hubble could survive into 2020 . Based on solar activity and atmospheric drag , or lack thereof , a natural atmospheric reentry for Hubble will occur between 2030 and 2040 . In June 2016 , NASA extended the service contract for Hubble until June 2021 . 
 NASA 's original plan for safely de @-@ orbiting Hubble was to retrieve it using a space shuttle . Hubble would then have most likely been displayed in the Smithsonian Institution . This is no longer possible since the space shuttle fleet has been retired , and would have been unlikely in any case due to the cost of the mission and risk to the crew . Instead , NASA considered adding an external propulsion module to allow controlled re @-@ entry . Ultimately NASA installed the Soft Capture and Rendezvous System , to enable deorbit by either a crewed or robotic mission .

 There is no direct successor to Hubble as an ultraviolet and visible @-@ light space telescope , as near @-@ term space telescopes do not duplicate Hubble 's wavelength coverage ( near @-@ ultraviolet to near @-@ infrared wavelengths ) , instead concentrating on the farther infrared bands . These bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low @-@ temperature objects , objects generally older and farther away in the universe . These wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground , justifying the expense of a space @-@ based telescope . Large ground @-@ based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble , sometimes challenge HST in terms of resolution by using adaptive optics ( AO ) , have much larger light @-@ gathering power , and can be upgraded more easily , but cannot yet match Hubble 's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very dark background of space . 
 Plans for a Hubble successor materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project , which culminated in plans for the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) , the formal successor of Hubble . Very different from a scaled @-@ up Hubble , it is designed to operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 Lagrangian point , where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened . It is not engineered to be fully serviceable ( such as replaceable instruments ) , but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft . A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe , beyond the reach of existing instruments . It is expected to detect stars in the early Universe approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects . The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA , the European Space Agency , and the Canadian Space Agency since 1996 , and is planned for launch on an Ariane 5 rocket . Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument , its coverage extends down to 600 nm wavelength light , or roughly orange in the visible spectrum . A typical human eye can see to about 750 nm wavelength light , so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands , including orange and red light . 
 A complementary telescope , looking at even longer wavelengths than Hubble or JWST , was the European Space Agency 's Herschel Space Observatory , launched on May 14 , 2009 . Like JWST , Herschel was not designed to be serviced after launch , and had a mirror substantially larger than Hubble 's , but observed only in the far infrared and submillimeter . It needed helium coolant , of which it ran out on April 29 , 2013 . 
 Further concepts for advanced 21st @-@ century space telescopes include the Advanced Technology Large @-@ Aperture Space Telescope , a conceptualized 8- to 16 @-@ meter ( <unk> to 640 @-@ inch ) optical space telescope that if realized could be a more direct successor to HST , with the ability to observe and photograph astronomical objects in the visible , ultraviolet , and infrared wavelengths , with substantially better resolution than Hubble or the Spitzer Space telescope . This effort is being planned for the 2025 – 2035 time frame . 
 Existing ground @-@ based telescopes , and various proposed Extremely Large Telescopes , can exceed the HST in terms of sheer light @-@ gathering power and diffraction limit due to larger mirrors , but other factors affect telescopes . In some cases , they may be able to match or beat Hubble in resolution by using adaptive optics . However , AO on large ground @-@ based reflectors will not make Hubble and other space telescopes obsolete . Most AO systems sharpen the view over a very narrow field — Lucky Cam , for example , produces crisp images just 10 " to 20 " wide , whereas Hubble 's cameras are super sharp across a 2 ½ ' ( 150 " ) field . Furthermore , space telescopes can study the universe across the entire electromagnetic spectrum , most of which is blocked by Earth 's atmosphere . Finally , the background sky is darker in space than on the ground , because air absorbs solar energy during the day and then releases it at night , producing a faint — but nevertheless discernible — airglow that washes out low @-@ contrast astronomical objects .
