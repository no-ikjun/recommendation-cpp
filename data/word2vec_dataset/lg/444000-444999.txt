 = HMS Howe ( 32 ) = 
 HMS Howe ( pennant number 32 ) was the last of the five British King George V @-@ class battleships of the Royal Navy . Built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company , she was laid down on 1 June 1937 and launched 9 April 1940 . She was originally to have been named Beatty but this was changed to Howe , after Admiral Richard Howe . Howe was completed on 29 August 1942 after her building time was extended , as needed war supplies were diverted to work of a higher priority such as the construction and repair of both merchant ships and escort ships . Like her sister @-@ ship Anson , Howe would spend most of her career in the Arctic providing cover for Russian convoys . 
 In 1943 Howe took part in Operation Husky and bombarded Trapani naval base and Favignana in support of the allied invasions . Along with King George V , Howe escorted two surrendered Italian battleships to Alexandria . Howe was also sent to the Pacific and attached to Task Force 113 , where she provided naval bombardments for the Allied landings at Okinawa on 1 April 1945 . 
 Following the end of the war , Howe spent four years as flagship of the Training Squadron at Portland , before she was placed in reserve in 1950 . The battleship was marked for disposal in 1957 , sold for scrap in 1958 , and completely broken up by 1961 .

 In the aftermath of the First World War , the Washington Naval Treaty was drawn up in 1922 in an effort to stop an arms race developing between Britain , Japan , France , Italy and the United States . This treaty limited the number of ships each nation was allowed to build and capped the tonnage of all capital ships at 35 @,@ 000 tons . These restrictions were extended in 1930 through the Treaty of London , however , by the mid @-@ 1930s Japan and Italy had withdrawn from both of these treaties and the British became concerned about a lack of modern battleships within their navy . As a result , the Admiralty ordered the construction of a new battleship class : the King George V class . Due to the provisions of both the Washington Naval Treaty and the Treaty of London , both of which were still in effect when the King George Vs were being designed , the main armament of the class was limited to the 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) guns prescribed under these instruments . They were the only battleships built at that time to adhere to the treaty and even though it soon became apparent to the British that the other signatories to the treaty were ignoring its requirements , it was too late to change the design of the class before they were laid down in 1937 . 
 The keel of the Howe , the last ship of the King George V class , was laid on 1 June 1937 at the Fairfield Shipyard in Govan . She was originally to have been named HMS Beatty , after Admiral David Beatty , commander of the British battlecruiser squadron at the Battle of Jutland , but the name was changed to HMS Howe , after Admiral Richard Howe . Howe was launched on 9 April 1940 and completed on 20 August 1942 . She carried improved anti @-@ aircraft armament and radar equipment as a result of lessons already learned in World War II . 
 = = Design = = 
 Howe displaced 39 @,@ 150 long tons ( 39 @,@ 780 t ) as built and 44 @,@ 510 long tons ( 45 @,@ 220 t ) fully loaded . She had an overall length of 744 feet 11 @.@ 5 inches ( 227 @.@ 1 m ) , a beam of 103 feet ( 31 @.@ 4 m ) and a draught of 29 feet 6 inches ( 9 @.@ 0 m ) . Her designed metacentric height was 6 feet 1 inch ( 1 @.@ 85 m ) at normal load and 8 feet 1 inch ( 2 @.@ 46 m ) at deep load . 
 The ship was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving four propeller shafts . Steam was provided by eight Admiralty 3 @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers , which normally delivered 100 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 75 @,@ 000 kW ) but could produce 110 @,@ 000 shp ( 82 @,@ 000 kW ) at emergency overload . This gave Howe a top speed of 27 @.@ 62 knots ( 51 @.@ 15 km / h ; 31 @.@ 78 mph ) . The ship carried 4 @,@ 210 long tons ( 4 @,@ 300 t ) of fuel oil . She also carried 183 long tons ( 200 t ) of diesel oil , 262 long tons ( 300 t ) of reserve feed water and 442 long tons ( 400 t ) of freshwater . At full speed Howe had a range of 2 @,@ 600 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 800 km ; 3 @,@ 000 mi ) at 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Howe mounted 10 BL 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) Mk VII guns . The 14 @-@ inch guns were mounted in one Mark II twin turret forward and two Mark III quadruple turrets , one forward and one aft . The guns could be elevated 40 degrees and depressed 3 degrees . Training arcs were : turret " A " , 286 degrees ; turret " B " , 270 degrees ; turret " Y " , 270 degrees . Training and elevating was done by hydraulic drives , with rates of two and eight degrees per second , respectively . A full gun broadside weighed 15 @,@ 950 pounds ( 7 @,@ 230 kg ) , and a salvo could be fired every 40 seconds . The secondary armament consisted of 16 QF 5 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 133 mm ) Mk I guns which were mounted in eight twin mounts , weighing 81 tons each . The maximum range of the Mk I guns was 24 @,@ 070 yd ( 22 @,@ 010 m ) at 45 degrees with HE shell at 2 @,@ 672 ft / s ( 814 m / s ) , the anti @-@ aircraft ceiling was 49 @,@ 000 feet ( 14 @,@ 935 @.@ 2 m ) . The guns could be elevated to 70 degrees and depressed to 5 degrees . The nominal rate of fire was ten to twelve rounds per minute , but in practice the guns could only fire seven to eight rounds per minute . Upon commissioning , along with her main and secondary batteries , Howe carried 48 QF 2 pdr 1 @.@ 575 @-@ inch ( 40 @.@ 0 mm ) Mk.VIII " pom @-@ pom " anti @-@ aircraft guns and 18 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) Oerlikon AA guns

 Howe joined the Home Fleet on 30 August 1942 , her building time extended , owing to more urgent demands of the industry . Like her sister ship Anson , she was to spend the early years of her combat career in Arctic waters , covering convoys bound for Russia . On 31 December 1942 , Howe and her sister ship King George V provided distant cover for convoy <unk> , which safely arrived in Loch Ewe on 9 January 1943 . Howe and King George V also provided distant cover for convoy <unk> on 1 March 1943 and helped to recover merchantmen whose ships had been sunk . In 1943 , however , Howe was transferred to Gibraltar with King George V to take part in Operation Husky , the Allied invasion of Sicily ; the US battleships Alabama and South Dakota substituted for their absence from the Home Fleet . The two British ships shelled Trapani naval base and Favignana during 11 – 12 July . Based in Algiers , the pair also offered cover during Operation Avalanche @-@ the Allied landings at Salerno @-@ setting out on 7 September . On 14 September Howe and King George V escorted the surrendered Italian battleships Vittorio Veneto and Italia to Alexandria . 
 By the end of October 1943 , Howe and King George V had returned to Britain . At the end of year , Howe underwent a long overhaul at Devonport , where a number of alterations were made . Her anti @-@ aircraft armament was increased , changes were made to her radar , and her watertight integrity in the stern was improved . Modifications were accomplished in the officers and crew quarters for operations in tropical climates ; these included changes in insulation , and the extensive use of air @-@ conditioning equipment . 
 = = = Pacific operations = = = 
 On 8 August 1944 , Howe arrived at Trincomalee in Ceylon to join the Eastern Fleet @-@ she was the first modern British battleship to be deployed in eastern waters since the loss of Prince of Wales in December 1941 . Howe was put into action quickly , providing cover for carrier based air operations against targets in Sumatra . In December she moved to Sydney , where she sailed to Auckland , New Zealand , for a flag @-@ waving visit . In February 1945 , Howe and King George V sailed from Sydney to begin operations in earnest in the Pacific theatre ; together with four carriers , five cruisers and fifteen destroyers , they made up Task Force 113 . 
 The first major undertaking for Task Force 113 ( now redesignated <unk> ) was Operation Iceberg @-@ offshore support for the US landings at Okinawa @-@ which got under way on 1 April 1945 . The force was subjected to sporadic Japanese kamikaze attacks , but the two ships emerged unscathed from these actions . Howe 's anti @-@ aircraft batteries also succeeded in shooting down an attacking kamikaze plane . The two ships ' principal roles were air defence and land bombardment , the latter being carried out very accurately , particularly by Howe against anti @-@ aircraft installations on the island of Miyako , half way between Okinawa and Formosa .

 By the first week of June 1945 , Howe was back in Sydney , and almost immediately it was decided to send her for a refit in Durban . It was here that she saw out the remainder of the war . She was relocated back to Portsmouth by January 1946 . In 1951 , Howe was placed in reserve and towed to Devonport . She was ordered to be scrapped in 1957 . On 27 May 1958 , Howe was towed to Inverkeithing to be broken up by T. W. Ward and Co . The Royal Navy presented the ship 's bell to St Giles ' Cathedral in Edinburgh .

 " Via Negativa " is the seventh episode of the eighth season and the 168th episode overall of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . The episode first aired in the United States and Canada on December 17 , 2000 on Fox and subsequently aired in the United Kingdom . It was written by executive producer Frank Spotnitz and directed by Tony Wharmby . It is a Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week episode , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 3 and was viewed by 12 @.@ 37 million viewers . It was generally well received by television critics , with many positively commenting on the " eerie " atmosphere of the dream sequences ; one critic referred to it as a " superb X @-@ Files episode . " 
 The series centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) and her new partner John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) — following the alien abduction of her former partner , Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) — who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In this episode , Scully takes time off to deal with the early stages of her pregnancy , and Doggett and Walter Skinner attempt to avert the mysterious murder spree of a religious cult leader who kills his victims in their sleep . Eventually , the cult leader 's essence of evil possesses Doggett , who is urged to murder Scully while he sleeps . 
 Spotnitz was inspired to write the episode after being intrigued by the mental image of a tube of toothpaste that , when opened , oozed blood . Because Gillian Anderson was not available for the majority of filming , the recurring characters of Walter Skinner and The Lone Gunmen were brought in . The episode 's title , " Via Negativa " — which means " Negative Way " in Latin — is a theology that attempts to describe God by characterizing what God is not . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Pittsburgh , two FBI agents , Angus Stedman ( Lawrence <unk> ) and James Leeds ( Kevin McClatchy ) , are observing a house when Leeds falls asleep . When he awakes , he discovers that the front door of the house is open . The two agents investigate and stumble upon a room filled with dead bodies . Suddenly , a man wielding an axe and possessing a third eye murders both agents with a blow to the head . 
 The following day , Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) calls John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) to inform him about the case and says she will not be joining him , due to personal matters . Doggett visits the crime scene , where he meets up with his boss , Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) . Skinner tells him about the cult and how the victims died . Leeds ' body is found in his car , but his partner , Stedman , is missing , along with cult leader Anthony Tipet ( Keith Szarabajka ) : the man with the third eye . The FBI later finds Stedman at his locked @-@ up condo with a fatal blow to the head . Meanwhile , Tipet is searching for a pharmacist and stumbles into a phone booth to call an unnamed person . When a tramp asks him for change , Tipet attacks the tramp , trapping him in the pavement and axing his forehead . 
 At the FBI , Skinner briefs Alvin Kersh ( James Pickens , Jr . ) , and other agents about the case . He tells them that Tipet used a hallucinogen <unk> <unk> to bring himself closer to God using a combination of Christian and Eastern religious practices called the via negativa , meaning the " negative way " in Latin . Tracing Tipet 's earlier call leads Doggett and Skinner to Andre Bormanis ( Grant <unk> ) , a drug dealer . Bormanis is arrested , and put in a cell at the local police department . At the jail , Doggett has a vision of him holding Scully 's severed head in his hands . After waking , Doggett realizes his vision was a bad dream . Meanwhile , in his cell , Bormanis has fallen asleep , and is dreaming of being attacked by rats . Doggett and the other officers find Bormanis ' gnawed up @-@ body . 
 Doggett returns to the X @-@ Files office , where , to his surprise , he meets The Lone Gunmen . They tell him about the history of the third eye . While coming to the same conclusion , they are convinced that Tipet is projecting himself into peoples dreams and killing them there . Returning to the warehouse where they found Bormanis , Skinner and Doggett meet Tipet , who is trying to take his own life by pushing his head through a table saw . They rush him to the hospital , where Doggett by surprise finds Scully 's name on the register . With Tipet in a coma , Kersh decides to pull the plug on the case , saying they 've found the main suspect . But Doggett and Skinner are not satisfied , saying there are no explanations for the various murders and events surrounding the case . 
 The next day , Doggett wakes up and discovers that he now has a third eye in the middle of his forehead . Suddenly , it vanishes . At the FBI building , he talks to Skinner , hoping for reassurance . He expresses his fear that , despite Tipet being in a coma , Tipet may still be able to enter into his dreams . Skinner , however , dismisses his concerns and sends him home . While leaving , Doggett has a hallucination of Tipet , ordering him to kill Scully . Suddenly , Doggett finds himself in front of Scully . Rather than kill his partner , he turns the axe upon himself . Doggett is immediately awakened from his dark reverie and finds himself in his bedroom , with Scully standing over his bed . He begins to thank her for saving his life , but she informs him that Tipet died due to his coma .

 Frank Spotnitz , the writer of the episode , was inspired to write the episode after a rafting trip . During the trip , Spotnitz met a " friend of a friend , " who constantly mentioned an " image that freaked him out . " The man explained that the image was a tube of toothpaste that , when opened , would have " blood come out . " The mental image intrigued Spotnitz , who later postulated , " How could you create a story where blood comes out of a tube of toothpaste ? " Due to the strangeness of the idea , Spotnitz was unable to think of any real @-@ world scenarios having likeness to the image , so he began to look into " dreams and nightmares . " He eventually came up with the idea of a cult trying to reach a higher plane of existence , but instead stumbling into a " lower place , a darker plane . " Spotnitz later explained : " What if the higher plane is a darker plane , what if we think we 're reaching up but we 're reaching down . " <unk> , the episode 's title , " Via Negativa , " means " Negative Way " in Latin . This type of theology , more commonly referred to as apophatic theology , attempts to describe God by expanding upon what God is not . 
 Gillian Anderson 's character Dana Scully would not be available , since the writing staff had decided before the episode was written that she would spend most of her time in the hospital . As the writing staff had a hard time coming up with a story , Spotnitz saw this as an opportunity to further evolve Doggett , the new character introduced at the beginning of the eighth season . In order to fill Anderson 's void , two recurring groups of characters were brought in : Walter Skinner and The Lone Gunmen . Spotnitz noted that , " we were eager to get Skinner out from behind the desk , and we were always looking for opportunities to get him out of that office and get him into the field . " Mitch Pileggi , who portrayed Walter Skinner , was pleased with the final product . He later complimented the work of Robert Patrick , who played Doggett , saying , " It was a big hole when Mulder was gone , but I thought that Robert came in and did a wonderful job . He brought a really good energy to the set , and it was a lot of fun getting to know and work with him . " In addition , Spotnitz was also eager to use The Lone Gunmen in the episode , since this the episode would mark their first scene together with Doggett . Robert Patrick called the episode his " favorite episode , " because the writers saw a chance to really create a " vulnerable " moment for the his character , John Doggett . 
 The character of Andre Bormanis was named after one of Spotnitz 's childhood friends , who went on to become one of the science consultants for both Star Trek : Voyager and Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . In preparing the character 's death scene the director , Tony Wharmby spent a whole day shooting inserts of rats . In total , the film crew used 500 rats . Initially , Wharmby had an issue getting the rats in the middle of the room being shot . In order to fix this , animal trainers continuously released more rats until the middle part of the room was finally covered . The crew later spent many hours " painting out rat droppings in that shot . "

 Initial examination for constructing an airport in Kamloops began in June 1931 , when the city leased 46 acres ( 19 ha ) from fruit @-@ growing company BC Fruitlands . The airport 's development started in 1936 and the gravel runway completed in 1938 . That same year , Kamloops acquired another 30 acres ( 12 ha ) , as well as land for airport use . The Department of Transport , now known as Transport Canada , granted money for airport development in 1939 , with the airfield 's runway finishing in that year . On April 13 , 1939 , an Aeronca aircraft made the first official landing on the runway . The airport was publicly opened on August 5 , 1939 , along with an air show presented at the structure itself with over 30 aircraft . Later that month , it was classified as a port of entry by the Canadian government . During World War II , additional activity occurred at the airport . In April 1942 , Vancouver @-@ based Gilbert Flight School transferred its service to Kamloops , as civil flights provided in British Columbia 's Lower Mainland were canceled . 
 In addition , the airport was used by the Royal Canadian Air Force ( RCAF ) as an alternate route for the no longer existent Air Transport Command ( ATC ) for flights to the Soviet Union . During the war Kamloops gained access to 861 acres ( 348 ha ) for further airport expansion , as well as the addition of taxi and apron services . However , after World War II , part of the airport 's land were sold to Canada 's Department of Agriculture , with the size reducing to 570 acres ( 230 ha ) . In May 1944 , the Governor General of Canada at that time , Earl of Athlone , entitled the structure Fulton Field , in honor of John Fulton , a Wing Commander server born in Kamloops . This was confirmed by George H. Greer , the secretary of the Kamloops Board of Trade at the time . Throughout its history , a number of airlines have served it . Canadian Pacific Air Lines provided daily flights in 1950 connecting to the communities of Quesnel , Prince George , Williams Lake and Vancouver . 
 By 1951 , the airport founded and became headquarters of Central British Columbia Airways , which was later known as Pacific Western Airlines , but is no longer existent . However , the following year , its headquarters was transferred to Richmond 's Vancouver International Airport . The federal Department of Transport regained rights to the airport in 1961 , beginning an expansion program . The airfield saw its runways expand in 1963 and 1964 , and the first air traffic controllers started working at Kamloops Airport in 1967 . That year the airport served approximately 29 @,@ 200 passengers . 
 There had previously been proposals for relocating the airport due to low public visibility during the fall and winter seasons of a specific year . The move was never carried out become another location could not be found . Instead the airport was expanded by 1969 . This saw its administrative buildings , offices , baggage area and coffee shop being improved , costing $ 85 @,@ 000 . There was a flood threat aimed close to the airport in 1972 , while in the following year , the airfield 's runways were extended . Obtaining 149 @,@ 027 passengers by 1974 , more considered the airport reliable , as it was improved with the addition of more general services . 
 Kamloops Airport 's telecommunication equipment was provided at a separate building in 1977 , with 235 @,@ 600 passengers garnered from it that same year . The airport saw the start of its runways and terminals expansion in 1982 and 1984 , while the following year this was completed . During 1986 and 1987 , the former terminal building was changed to serve as an operation structure . Air BC , Pacific Western Airlines and Time Air served as the airport 's airlines in the 1980s ; all three airlines no longer exist . In 1988 , the amount of passengers dropped to 137 @,@ 579 . The runway has been used by <unk> , Airbus 320s , Boeing 727 @-@ 200s , Boeing 737 @-@ 400s , Boeing 737 @-@ 700s , Cessna 150s and Grumman TBF Avenger since historical dates . 
 However , by 2009 , its terminal , runway and navigation aids were upgraded with about $ 25 million , which was funded by the British Columbia government , who gave $ 4 million , the Canadian government , who gave $ 6 @.@ 6 million and the airport itself for the remaining money and announced in 2007 ; $ 13 million was used to upgrade the runway , $ 3 million was used to expand the navigation aid , while $ 4 million was used for terminal improvements . The city 's intention was to expand and upgrade the airport in order for the economy and tourism to expand . City mayor Peter <unk> and members of the Kamloops Indian Band praised its expansion . Its catchment area has a population of approximately 138 @,@ 000 residents . 
 Kelowna International Airport , an international airport operated in nearby city of Kelowna , has had a small impact on this airport , since they both share the same catchment area . About 13 percent of the local residents in 2007 choose the Kelowna International Airport over the Kamloops Airport to fly to regional destinations , specifically due to its significant growth . Despite this , some Kelowna residents choose the Kamloops Airport over their local airport .

The Kamloops Airport has been owned by a number of companies since its opening . It was initially owned by the RCAF , but later there was a proposal led the RCAF to transfer airport ownership to Kamloops itself , hence why the name was changed to the Kamloops Airport , although it is commonly referred to as Fulton Field or Fulton Airport . During the 1990s , Transport Canada , the owner at that time , began a program to transfer ownership of selected regional airports and the ownership of the Kamloops Airport was transferred to the then @-@ new Kamloops Airport Authority Society by August 1997 which is a department of the Kamloops City Council and was composed of its members ; it was deemed a commercial operation . Kamloops Airport Authority Society have a contract with the Vancouver Airport Authority , which allow them to manage and operate the airport . It is operated by Kamloops Airport Limited .

 = Fair catch kick = 
 The fair catch kick is a rule at the professional and high school levels of American football that allows a team that has just made a fair catch to attempt a free kick from the spot of the catch . The kick must be either a place kick or a drop kick , and if it passes over the crossbar and between the goalposts of the defensive team 's goal , a field goal , worth three points , is scored to the offensive team . 
 The fair catch kick has its origins in rugby football . The rule is considered to be obscure and unusual , as most fair catches are made well out of field goal range , and in most cases a team that has a fair catch within theoretical range will attempt a normal drive to score a touchdown . The fair catch kick is generally used when a team has fair caught a ball within field goal range and there is insufficient time to score a touchdown . At the professional level , the last successful fair catch kick was made in 1976 . 
 = = Rule = = 
 The fair catch kick rule states that , after a player has successfully made a fair catch or has been awarded a fair catch ( as the result of a penalty such as kick catch interference ) , their team can attempt a kick from the spot of the catch ; the NFHS also allows a kick to be made if the down following the fair catch or awarded fair catch has to be replayed . Prior to the kick , the opposing team must be lined up at least ten yards beyond the spot of the ball . The kick itself can be either a place kick or drop kick ; a kicking tee cannot be used at the professional level , but use of a tee up to two inches in height is permitted at the high school level . Like other field goal attempts , the kicking team is awarded three points if the kick goes above the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team 's goal and did not touch a player of the offensive team after the kick . If the attempt fails , the opposing team is awarded control of the ball from the spot of the kick . The opposing team can also return the kick if it does not go out of bounds . 
 In the National Federation of State High School Associations ( NFHS ) rulebook , the fair catch kick is specifically defined as a free kick . The National Football League ( NFL ) rulebook specifically states that the fair catch kick is not a free kick , instead considering the fair catch kick to be a distinct type of kick . Despite this , reporters at both levels describe the fair catch kick as a free kick . 
 = = History = = 
 The fair catch kick found in American football originated in rugby football . A similar rule in rugby , the goal from mark , allowed a player who had fair caught a ball to attempt an uncontested free kick from the spot of the fair catch . Both major codes of rugby have eliminated the rule ; rugby league abolished the goal from mark in 1922 , and rugby union removed it in 1977 . Australian rules football has retained the rule , and it is a vital part of the Australian game ; a " fair catch " of a ball kicked more than 15 metres in the air is called a " mark " , and the player making the mark is then awarded a free kick . The fair catch kick has been present in the National Football League ( NFL ) rulebook since the league 's inception , and also remains in the National Federation of State High School Associations ( NFHS ) rulebook . The fair catch kick is not legal in National Collegiate Athletics Association ( NCAA ) football ; the NCAA abolished the fair catch in 1950 , but re @-@ added it a year later . When the fair catch returned to the rulebook , however , the option to attempt a kick after the fair catch was removed . 
 = = Usage = = 
 The fair catch kick rule is very rarely invoked , and is one of the rarest plays in football . The rule has been regarded as " obscure " , " bizarre " , and " quirky " . A unique set of circumstances is required for a fair catch kick to be a viable option . For one , the fair catch would need to be made at a point on the field where a field goal attempt has a reasonable chance of being successful ; most fair catches are made well outside of field goal range ( even more so since 1974 , when the goal posts were moved back to the end line , adding 10 yards to such attempts ) . Furthermore , for a fair catch kick to be a viable option near the end of the fourth quarter , the team attempting the kick needs to be either tied or behind by three points or less . In exceptional circumstances a team might try the kick at the end of the first half if only a few seconds remained , but Art McNally , who led the officiating department of the National Football League from 1968 to 1990 , notes that , even in the event a fair catch is made within field goal range , most teams would attempt to score a touchdown unless there is not enough time left to score one . Accordingly , most fair catch kick attempts occur when a team has fair caught a ball from a punt from deep in their opponent 's territory , and there is not enough time left in the half to go for a touchdown . 
 Despite its drawbacks , there are several advantages to using the fair catch kick . Because the defense is required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick , the kicker can take a running start before kicking as opposed to the typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts . Similarly , the kicker does not have to worry about a low snap because the ball is not snapped . The defense is not able to block the kick , allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual . The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot , because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch , while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage .

With the exception of the second recorded attempt , which was made in the 3rd quarter , all fair catch kick attempts were made within the last thirty seconds of either the 2nd or 4th quarter . The last successful attempt was made in 1976 by Ray Wersching of the San Diego Chargers ( 45 yards ) , and the longest successful attempt was made in 1964 by Paul Hornung of the Green Bay Packers ( 52 yards ) .

 = <unk> Melayu = 
 <unk> Melayu ( Jawi script : <unk> <unk> ; literally " Malay dominance " ) is a political concept emphasising Malay preeminence in present @-@ day Malaysia . The Malays of Malaysia claimed a special position and special rights owing to their long domicile and the fact that the present Malaysian state itself evolved from a Malay polity . The oldest political institution in Malaysia is the system of Malay rulers of the nine Malay states . British colonial government transformed the system and turned it first into a system of indirect rule , then in 1948 , using this culturally based institution , they incorporated the Malay monarchy into the blueprints for the independent <unk> Tanah Melayu . 
 The term Tanah Melayu in its name which literally means " Malay homeland " , assumes proprietorship of the Malay states . In this way Britain strengthened Malay ethno @-@ nationalism , Malay ethnicity and culture and Malay sovereignty in the new nation @-@ state . Though other cultures would continue to flourish , the identity of the emerging political community was to be shaped by the " historic " political culture of its dominant Malay ethnic group . The Chinese and Indian immigrants who form a significant minority in Malaysia , are considered beholden to the Malays for granting them citizenship in return for special privileges as set out in Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia . This quid pro quo arrangement is usually referred to as the Malaysian social contract . The concept of ketuanan Melayu is usually cited by politicians , particularly those from the United Malays National Organisation ( UMNO ) , the most influential political party in Malaysia . 
 Although the idea itself predates Malaysian independence , the phrase ketuanan Melayu did not come into vogue until the early 2000s decade . Historically , the most vocal political opposition towards the concept has come from non @-@ Malay @-@ based parties , such as the Malaysian People 's Movement Party ( Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia ) and Democratic Action Party ( DAP ) ; in the 2000s decade , the multiracial People 's Justice Party ( Parti Keadilan Rakyat , or PKR ) also positioned itself against ketuanan Melayu , advocating instead ketuanan rakyat ( supremacy of the people ) . The idea of Malay supremacy gained attention in the 1940s , when the Malays organised themselves to protest the Malayan Union 's establishment , and later fought for independence . During the 1960s , there was a substantial effort challenging ketuanan Melayu led by the People 's Action Party ( PAP ) of Singapore — which was a state in Malaysia from 1963 to 1965 — and the DAP after Singapore 's secession . However , the portions of the Constitution related to ketuanan Melayu were " entrenched " after the race riots of 13 May 1969 , which followed an election campaign focused on the issue of non @-@ Malay rights and ketuanan Melayu . This period also saw the rise of " ultras " who advocated a one @-@ party government led by UMNO , and an increased emphasis on the Malays being the " definitive people " of Malaysia — i.e. only a Malay could be a true Malaysian . 
 The riots caused a major change in the government 's approach to racial issues , and led to the introduction of an aggressive affirmative action policy strongly favouring the Malays , the New Economic Policy ( NEP ) . The National Culture Policy , also introduced in 1970 , emphasised an assimilation of the non @-@ Malays into the Malay ethnic group . However , during the 1990s Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad rejected this approach , with his Bangsa Malaysia policy emphasising a Malaysian instead of Malay identity for the state . During the 2000s decade politicians began stressing ketuanan Melayu again , and publicly chastised government ministers who questioned the social contract .

 Ethnic Malays which make up the majority population of Malaysia at 50 @.@ 4 % , are an ethnic group of Austronesian people predominantly inhabiting the Malay Peninsula , including the southernmost parts of Thailand , the east coast of Sumatra , the coast of Borneo , and the smaller islands which lie between these locations . The true origin of ethnic Malays is still the subject of studies among historians , anthropologists and linguists . A popular theory suggested that the people who spoke Austronesian languages first arrived in Maritime Southeast Asia between <unk> and <unk> , as a part of Austronesian expansion from Taiwan to South East Asia . 
 However , a recent genetic studies carried out by HUGO ( Human Genome Organization ) involving almost 2000 people across Asia , points to another theory of Asian migration pattern . The HUGO findings support the hypothesis that Asia was populated primarily through a single migration event from the south and that the South East Asian region was populated first which contained the most diversity , then continuing slowly North with its diversity being lost . 
 Hindu and Buddhist influences arrived through trade contacts with the Indian subcontinent . The beginning of the first Millennium saw the rise of ancient Malay states in the coastal areas of Malay peninsular , notably the Red Earth Kingdom ( 1st century ) , <unk> Negara ( 2nd century ) , Langkasuka ( 2nd century ) , and Kedah ( 2nd century ) . Between 7th and 13th centuries , many of these small , often prosperous peninsular maritime trading states became part of the Srivijaya empire , a Malay kingdom centred in Palembang and <unk> . 
 By 15th century , the Malacca Sultanate , whose hegemony reached over much of the western Malay archipelago , had become the centre of Islamization in the east . The Malaccan tradition was transmitted onwards and fostered a vigorous ethos of Malay identity . Since this era , the Islamic faith became closely identified with Malay society and played a significant role in defining the Malay identity . The close identification of the Malays with Islam continued until the 20th century and was finally entrenched in the Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia as well as in the national philosophy of Brunei known as the Malay Islamic Monarchy . 
 The present day Malaysian Malays are divided broadly into " Malays proper " or " Peninsular Malays " ( Melayu Anak Jati or Melayu <unk> ) and " foreign Malays " ( Melayu Anak Dagang ) . The Malays proper consist of those individuals who adhere to the Malay culture which has developed in the Malay peninsula . Among notable groups are <unk> Malays , <unk> Malays and <unk> Malays . The foreign Malays consist of descendants of immigrants from other part of Malay archipelago who became the citizens of the Malay sultanates and were absorbed and assimilated into Malay culture at different times , aided by similarity in lifestyle and common religion ( Islam ) . Among notable groups are the Javanese , Minangkabau and Bugis Malays . 
 Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia defines a Malay as a Malaysian citizen born to a Malaysian citizen who professes to be a Muslim , habitually speaks the Malay language , adheres to Malay customs , and is domiciled in Malaysia or Singapore . Though this definition is not according to ancestry lineage , it is however correct in the sense of social behaviours . Culture , which controls a great proportion of general mentality and social behaviour , is succeeded through the mother tongue and religion . Article 160 unites Malays from different ethnic groups as the prevailing race and thus embraces them with the political prowess to dominate and rule over other races : Chinese , Indians , Kadazan , Iban , Orang Asli etc . This is also apparent from the name of UMNO ( United Malays National Organisation ) , who are a staunch political proponent of this role .

 = = = Early Malay nationalism = = = 
 Malay nationalism as an organised political movement existed since the invasion by foreign powers . However , the ethnic Chinese and Indian immigrants , forming a minority of the population , did not see themselves as Malayans . A report by the British Permanent Under @-@ Secretary of State for the Colonies in the early 1930s found that " the number of non @-@ Malays who have adopted Malaya as their home is only a very small proportion of the whole population " . 
 Although the British effectively ruled Malaya , de jure the Malays were coerced under fictitious agreements to accept the British administration through a residence system . British High Commissioner Sir Hugh Clifford , demonstrated the British ideology which rationalised colonialism in Malaya when he urged " everyone in this country [ to ] be mindful of the fact that this is a Malay country , and we British came here at the invitation of Their Highnesses the Malay Rulers , and it is our duty to help the Malays to rule their own country . " 
 Ostensibly the British adopted an open " Pro @-@ Malay " policy so the Malays could , in the words of High Commissioner Sir Laurence Guillemard , be equipped " to take their proper place in the administrative and commercial life of these States . " In reality , the non @-@ elite Malays felt marginalised by the economic and political policies of the colonial government , whereas in fact they were the backbone of British rule , and both educational and occupational policies were segregated according to ethnic lines . 
 The local @-@ born non @-@ Malay communities soon began the fight for self @-@ rule . In 1936 , the Malayan @-@ born Indian community asked High Commissioner Sir Shenton Thomas to grant them a share of administrative appointments . Thomas rejected the request , referring to the local @-@ born Indians as " foreigners " . Although the British appeared to view the Chinese as a " transient labor force , " with statistics indicating most Chinese migrants eventually returned home , critics contend that the local @-@ born Chinese population was steadily growing . Nevertheless , the British insisted it would be dangerous to consider the Chinese as having " a tendency to permanent settlement " ; the locally born Indian community — comprising 20 % of the Indian population , the rest being manual labourers having migrated for similar reasons as the Chinese at around the same time — was likewise largely ignored . 
 The British relegated the Malays to their " traditional " peasant lifestyle as far as possible , restricting movement , economic enterprises and education . This policy was maintained in the belief that education of Bengalis in India had led to discontent and rebellion . They involved only the Malay ruling class in government and administrative issues . Despite the exclusion of non @-@ Malays from positions of ostensible authority , much of the civil service rank and file comprised non @-@ Malays , many of them Indians who were specifically brought in for this purpose . A number of historians have described the pro @-@ Malay policies as designed merely to preserve the position of the British , rather than to strengthen that of the Malays ; many characterised the British approach as one of " divide and rule " , keeping " the races at just the right distance from each other to have the disparate elements of Malaya work in remote harmony " . 
 In the 1920s , the local @-@ born Chinese , who retained significant economic power , began pushing for a greater role in Malayan government . Much of the Chinese community , which now made up 45 % of the Malayan population , still comprised transient labourers . Nevertheless , the Straits Chinese — which comprised the bulk of local @-@ born Chinese — wanted to be given government positions and recognised as Malayans . One Straits Chinese leader asked , " Who said this is a Malay country ? ... When Captain [ Francis ] Light arrived , did he find Malays , or Malay villages ? Our forefathers came here and worked hard as coolies — weren 't ashamed to become coolies — and they didn 't send their money back to China . They married and spent their money here , and in this way the Government was able to open up the country from jungle to civilization . We 've become inseparable from this country . It 's ours , our country ... " Malay intellectuals objected to this reasoning , claiming that such reasoning is totally absurd and proposing an analogy with the Chinese as masons and Malaya as a house . A paid mason , they argued , was not entitled to a share in the ownership rights to a home he built . As such , they opposed any attempt to grant the Chinese citizenship or other political rights . 
 A number of Indonesian ethnic groups such as the Javanese and Bugis had migrated within the Malay Archipelago throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , and were most quickly assimilated into the Malay cultural identity . Eventually , the Chinese @-@ Malayan appeals appeared to have some impact on the British . In 1927 , the Governor of the Straits Settlements referred to the Chinese as " indigenous inhabitants of British Malaya " . 
 Just before World War II , Malay nationalism began emphasising ketuanan Melayu , which had once been taken for granted . It was feared that British policies now seemed geared towards creating a common Malayan nationality inclusive of the Chinese and Indians . Some Malays thus sought to preserve the status quo with the British as a bulwark against the non @-@ Malays . Others began calling for an independent and sovereign Malay nation , such as " Greater Indonesia " . 
 = = = The Malayan Union ( 1946 – 48 ) = = = 
 After World War II , the British announced the establishment of the Malayan Union , which would loosen immigration policies , reduce the sovereignty of the Malay rulers , and not recognise Malay supremacy , establishing Malaya as a protectorate of the United Kingdom . As local @-@ born residents , most Chinese and Indians qualified for citizenship under the Union 's principle of jus soli . With equal rights guaranteed to all , the Malays became dissatisfied with that . Even their traditional stronghold , the civil service , would be open to all Malayans . In the first place , the Malays did not consider themselves to be included under the label of " Malayans " . 
 The Malays became politically conscious , protesting the Union 's formation . At one gathering , placards declared that " Malaya Belongs to the Malays . We do not want the other races to be given the rights and privileges of the Malays . " One Malay organisation told the British that the Union 's citizenship provisions would lead to " the wiping from existence of the Malay race along with their land and Rulers " . A group of Malay royalists and civil servants led by Dato ' Onn Ja 'afar formed the United Malays National Organisation ( UMNO ) to protest the Malayan Union 's formation . 
 Although the Union was established as planned , the campaign continued ; in 1948 , the British replaced the Malayan Union with the Federation of Malaya . The Federation restored sovereignty to the Malay rulers , tightened immigration and citizenship restrictions , and gave the Malays special privileges . Nevertheless , the avowed goal of the British remained the same as in 1946 : to introduce " a form of common citizenship open to all those , irrespective of race , who regarded Malaya as their real home and as the object of their loyalty . " 
 Limited opposition to ketuanan Melayu and UMNO during this period came from a coalition between the All @-@ Malaya Council of Joint Action ( AMCJA ) and the Pusat <unk> Rakyat ( PUTERA ) . Although one of PUTERA 's constituent organisations had insisted on ketuanan Melayu as a " National Birthright " of the Malays , PUTERA joined the AMCJA in championing equal political rights for non @-@ Malays . After the British refused to heed the PUTERA @-@ AMCJA coalition , it pulled out of talks with the British , later launching a major <unk> ( general strike ) to protest perceived defects in the new polity . After the Federation was formed over their objections , the coalition disbanded . 
 Prior to the Federation , non @-@ Malays were generally uninvolved in Malayan politics and nationalism , both essentially Malay in nature ; being more interested in the politics of their respective homelands , non @-@ Malays never significantly backed the Malayan Union openly but their silence was a support to it . The AMCJA , though mostly non @-@ Malay , did not represent a large section of the non @-@ Malay communities in Malaya . The lack of interest in or loyalty to Malaya amongst the non @-@ Malays seemed to justify ketuanan Melayu — Malay self @-@ rule . 
 Some historians have argued the Union 's failure made the Chinese aware of the need for political representation . The Malayan Chinese Association ( MCA ) — a communal political party campaigning for Chinese political rights — was formed soon after the Federation 's formation . Others claim that the main driving force behind non @-@ Malay involvement in Malayan politics , and their assertion of certain rights , was the increasing number of local @-@ born non @-@ Malays . The same report from the British Permanent Under @-@ Secretary of State for the Colonies cited earlier stated that Malayan @-@ born non @-@ Malays " have never seen the land of their origin and they claim that their children and their children 's children should have fair treatment . " The inaugural President of the MCA was Tan Cheng Lock , a local @-@ born Chinese who had led the AMCJA until its breaking up . 
 = = = Towards independence = = = 
 Its initial goals achieved , UMNO established itself as a political party to fight for independence . At the same time , the Malayan Communist Party ( MCP ) launched an armed insurgency to form a communist government in Malaya , culminating in the Malayan Emergency which lasted until after independence . The insurgency was marked by a clear racial divide ; opposition to the insurrection was almost entirely Malay , while Chinese dominated the communist ranks . The British encouraged the establishment of the Communities Liaison Committee ( CLC ) , comprising the top echelon of Malayan politicians from different communities , to address sensitive issues , especially those related to race . Compromises on a number of issues , including citizenship , education , democracy , and Malay supremacy , were agreed on . Eventually , a " bargain " between the Malays and non @-@ Malays was formulated ; in return for giving up ketuanan Melayu , the Malays would be assisted in closing the economic gap between the Malay and non @-@ Malay communities . CLC member <unk> <unk> later said , " I and others believed that the backward Malays should be given a better deal . Malays should be assisted to attain parity with non @-@ Malays to forge a united Malayan Nation of equals . " 
 Problems continued to crop up . Many Chinese Malayan youths drafted into the army to stave off communist attacks fled the country ; most participants were English- and not Chinese @-@ educated . To the Malays , this indicated that the Chinese had no particular loyalty towards Malaya and justified ketuanan Melayu , heightening similar perceptions caused by the apparent racial dichotomy between those in fierce opposition to the communists and those supporting the MCP . 
 In the early 1950s , Onn Ja 'afar proposed to open UMNO membership to all Malayans , and renaming it the United Malayan National Organisation , which would have diluted its identity as a champion of ketuanan Melayu . Defeated in an internal power struggle , he resigned in 1951 to found the Independence of Malaya Party ( IMP ) . He was succeeded by Tunku Abdul Rahman ( often known as " the Tunku " ) , who insisted on initial Malay sovereignty . Expressing concern over a lack of loyalty to Malaya among non @-@ Malays , he demanded they clarify their allegiance before being accorded citizenship , going on to state : " For those who love and feel they owe undivided loyalty to this country , we will welcome them as Malayans . They must truly be Malayans , and they will have the same rights and privileges as the Malays . " Not long after , in 1952 , however , he appeared to contradict himself , and insisted that Malays safeguard their special position : " Malaya is for the Malays and it should not be governed by a mixture of races . " 
 During this period , some Straits Chinese began taking interest in local politics , especially in Penang , where there was an active Chinese secessionist movement . Identifying more with the British than the Malays , they were especially angered by references to them as pendatang asing ( foreigners ) . Avoiding both UMNO and the MCA , they believed that while UMNO and Malay extremists were intent on extending Malay privileges and restricting Chinese rights , the MCA was too " selfish " , and could not be relied on . Uncomfortable about the merger of the Straits Settlements with Malaya , they did not feel a sense of belonging in a " Malaya for the Malays " where they were not considered <unk> ( " sons of the soil " ) . One Straits Chinese leader indignantly declared , " I can claim to be more anak Pulau <unk> [ a son of Penang ] than 99 per cent of the Malays living here today . " With the government 's stout rejection of secession , the movement eventually petered out . 
 Some suggested that the non @-@ Malays did not feel loyal to Malaya because they did not consider themselves to be of Malayan nationality and adhere strictly to their own ethnic cultural backgrounds . To counter this , in 1952 citizenship was granted to nearly all local @-@ born non @-@ Malays , and dual citizenship prohibited , forcing non @-@ Malays to choose between their ancestral homeland and Malaya . In contrast to the Malay 's hypothesis , a majority of the non @-@ Malays remained , thus proving their allegiance to Malaya . They are the ancestor of modern @-@ day non @-@ Malay Malaysian . 
 As Malaya moved to self @-@ government , the British initiated the Member System , modelled on the cabinet system ; like the CLC , it drew on members of different communities , and was later described as setting a precedent for the power @-@ sharing multiracial Malayan and Malaysian cabinets post @-@ independence . At the same time , the British also began laying the framework for a national education system that would create " a sense of common citizenship " . The Barnes Report that they commissioned , however , was strongly objected to by the Chinese community for being " saturated with Malay nationalism " and bolstering ketuanan Melayu . The Fenn @-@ Wu Report , favoured by the Chinese , did not meet with Malay approval . In the end , the Barnes Report 's recommendations for English @-@ medium " national schools " were implemented by the 1952 Education Ordinance , over vocal Chinese protests , who were upset by the lack of provision for non @-@ Malay vernacular schools . In 1956 , a committee headed by Tun Abdul Razak re @-@ evaluated the education system . The " Razak Report " recommended that vernacular primary schools be permitted to continue , but share a common syllabus with national schools . Vernacular secondary schools would not be sanctioned ; only national secondary schools would be funded . The Chinese community strenuously objected to the Razak Report as well , launching an organised campaign against it ; the MCA 's refusal to oppose the Report cost it politically in some Chinese constituencies . Nevertheless , the Razak Report 's recommendations were largely successful , and many of them remain in place as of 2006 . 
 = = = Possible origins of ketuanan Melayu = = = 
 According to many historians , the root cause of ethnic strife and ketuanan Melayu was a lack of mixing between the Malays and non @-@ Malays . An exception to this were the Straits Chinese , who managed to assimilate reasonably well , despite the assimilation taking 600 years including intermarriage . According to the Ming Shi @-@ lu , the ancestors of the Straits Chinese were " gifts " given to the Sultan of Malacca as a recognition of both bilateral ties between the Ming Dynasty and the sultanate , and of Malay sovereignty . At the time , most were rich merchants during British rule instead of manual labourers and many habitually spoke Malay , dressed in the Malay style , and preferred Malay cuisine . 
 The British educational policies segregating the different races — providing minimal public education for Malays , and leaving non @-@ Malays to their own devices — did not help matters . The Malays , predominantly rural @-@ dwellers , were not encouraged to socialise with the more urban non @-@ Malays . The economic impoverishment of the Malays which set them apart from the better @-@ off Chinese also fanned racial sentiments . 
 Another contributing factor to ketuanan Melayu was the World War II Japanese occupation . The war " awakened a keen political awareness among Malayan people by intensifying communalism and racial hatred " . Japanese policies " politicised the Malay peasantry " , intentionally fanning the flames of Malay nationalism . Two Malay historians wrote that " The Japanese hostile acts against the Chinese and their apparently more favourable treatments of the Malays helped to make the Chinese community feel its separate identity more acutely ... " A foreign commentator agreed , stating that " During the occupation period ... Malay national sentiment had become a reality ; it was strongly anti @-@ Chinese , and its rallying cry [ was ] ' Malaya for the Malays ' ... " 
 = = = The Alliance - 1955 Federal Legislative Council elections = = = 
 Although UMNO supported ketuanan Melayu , it formed an " Alliance " with the MCA and the Malayan Indian Congress ( MIC ) to contest the 1955 Federal Legislative Council elections . This took many by surprise , as the MCA had strenuously insisted on equal political rights for all citizens . Its President , Tan Cheng Lock , was himself a Straits Chinese , albeit not as extremist as the secessionists . Although initially dismissed as a marriage of convenience , the Alliance won 51 out of 52 seats available . The sole remaining seat went to the Pan @-@ Malayan Islamic Party ( <unk> ; later known as PAS ) , a Malay @-@ based party and strong advocate of ketuanan Melayu . The total defeat of non @-@ communal parties led the Alliance to perceive the political atmosphere as inhospitable for multi @-@ racial parties . A coalition government comprising mono @-@ racial parties in which party leaders privately brokered compromise decisions was thought more stable and better suited to Malayan politics . 
 Prior to the election , Dato ' Onn Ja 'afar had changed his approach , forming the Parti Negara after IMP suffered crushing losses to the Alliance in local elections . Advocating stronger pro @-@ Malay policies recognising Malay political dominance , the Parti Negara failed to shake the Alliance 's grip on power . However , some believe Parti Negara 's proposals helped sway UMNO politicians towards more radically pro @-@ Malay policies . The British themselves insisted on handing over power only to a multiracial government , and the Alliance was considered to meet this requirement . 
 = = Independence and Malaysia = = 
 = = = Independence and the Constitution = = = 
 The Federation of Malaya became officially independent of the British Empire in 1957 . The new state 's Constitution contained provisions , such as Article 153 , guaranteeing the Malays certain privileges as a form of affirmative action . The Reid Commission , which drafted the Constitution , stated that Article 153 was to be temporary in nature , and should be reviewed by Parliament 15 years after independence . The Constitution itself did not explicitly state this , however , nor did it clarify the purpose of Article 153 . It did declare all Malayans equal under the law , without mention of " Malay sovereignty " or any other ideas related to ketuanan Melayu . Jus soli citizenship — the granting of citizenship to anyone born in the Federation — was also granted , albeit without retrospective effect ; it was a major concession by the Malays , who had vigorously campaigned against jus soli citizenship in the Malayan Union . 
 On the other hand , Malay and Islam became the national language and official religion , while the Malay rulers remained . This was taken to mean that the Malays were accorded deference as the definitive people of Malaya — i.e. being a Malayan would be the same as being a Malay — and in the eyes of many , gave Malaya a Malay identity . One academic suggested that " The Malays have a deep @-@ rooted feeling that they alone are the <unk> , the sons of the soil , and as such have certain special rights over the land . " Indeed , the Tunku said in 1964 that " It is understood by all that this country by its very name , its traditions and character , is Malay . ... In any other country where aliens try to dominate economic and other fields , eventually there is bitter opposition from the indigenous people . But not with the Malays . Therefore , in return , they must appreciate the position of the Malays ... " It has been suggested that a Malaysian nationality did not emerge because " all the national symbols in Malaysia were derived from the Malay tradition " . 
 The Constitutional restraint on the size of rural Parliamentary constituencies was later removed , providing what one commentator called " an indirect buttress " to Malay special rights ; as Malays were concentrated in rural areas , this indirectly enhanced Malay political power . The original Constitution had implicitly followed " one man , one vote " . The change was denounced as " giving one man one vote , another a number of votes : not on the basis of , say , intellectual ability or geographical accident , but in order to ensure the dominance of a particular group . " 
 The constitutional provisions , which have been referred to as the " Malay Agenda " , evoked little sentiment from non @-@ Malays , despite most of them gaining citizenship and thus becoming theoretically equal to Malay citizens under the Constitution . This could be attributed to acceptance of the social contract , of which one historian wrote : " At the elite level , non @-@ Malays recognized that Malays were politically superior by virtue of their indigenous status and that the Malaysian polity would have a Malay character ... Malays were to be assured of safe majorities in both the state and federal parliament ... Malays would control the highest positions of the government and ... dominate members of the federal cabinet . " A Malay historian wrote that " In return the Chinese gained more than overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia had dreamed of — equal citizenship , political participation and office holding , unimpaired economic opportunity , and tolerance for their language , religion , and cultural institutions . " 
 Some expressed trepidation at Article 153 ; shortly before independence , the China Press suggested that while special rights " may be excusable at the start of the building of a nation , " if " the period of ' special rights ' is not restricted , or the scope of special rights is not clearly defined , then endless disputes ... will arise later on , " and argued that special rights would eventually divide instead of unite Malayans . Nevertheless , at the time of independence , some historians assert , " there was a genuine sense of common citizenship , common aspirations , a common destiny . " This was about to change . 
 = = = Merger = = = 
 In 1961 , when the Malayan government began discussing a possible merger with neighbouring Singapore , Sabah , Sarawak and Brunei , problems of ethnic power relations arose again . The " Malaysia " proposal sans Sabah and Sarawak went back more than a decade ; earlier negotiations had proved fruitless . The Singaporeans themselves were not anxious to be ruled by what they considered a Malay government . By 1961 , however , Singapore had grown receptive to the idea of joining Malaysia , largely because of the prevailing idea at the time that industrial Singapore could not survive without access to Malayan markets . 
 The Malayan government was not keen on having the Chinese Singaporean population push the Malays into a minority position in the new Malaysia . Many Malays felt that upsetting the Malay @-@ dominated nature of the armed forces and police might place them in a dangerous situation . It was also argued that the inferior economic position of the Malays would be emphasised by the entry of even more rich Chinese , setting the stage for major discontent . The Malayans decided to resolve this by merging with Sabah and Sarawak ; both British colonies had large native populations whom the government considered " Malay " . Under Article 160 of the Constitution , most of them were not Malay ; the natives were mainly animists or Christians instead of Muslims as required . To resolve this issue , the government expanded its informal definition of " Malay " to include these people . 
 Sabahans and Sarawakians could not see how they would benefit from merger . Many regarded Malaya as being only for the Malays , a group they did not include themselves in . The spectre of " Malaysia " — the inclusion of the phrase " Malay " being considered frightening — with its official religion of Islam and official language of Malay , did nothing to soothe their fears of " Malay domination " . For merger to come about , they insisted the natives of Sabah and Sarawak be awarded the same privileges as Malays . A 20 @-@ point agreement between Sabah and the Malayan government , and a slightly different 18 @-@ point agreement by Sarawak , was later agreed upon . After much negotiation and a show of support from the British for merger , the impasse was resolved . Although natives of Borneo were denied the privileges of Malays , merger was effected on 16 September 1963 . 
 = = = " Malaysian Malaysia ! " = = = 
 In the 1963 Singapore state elections , the Alliance challenged the governing People 's Action Party ( PAP ) through the Singapore Alliance Party . UMNO politicians actively campaigned in Singapore for the Singapore Alliance , contending that Singaporean Malays were being treated as second @-@ class citizens under the Chinese @-@ dominated , though ostensibly multiracial , PAP government . However , all of the UMNO @-@ backed Malay candidates lost to the PAP . The PAP politicians , who saw this as a betrayal of an earlier agreement with the Alliance not to contest elections in Malaya and Singapore ( respectively ) , decided to run on the mainland in the 1964 general election . Although the PAP attracted large crowds at its rallies , it won only one seat — that by Devan Nair , who represented the Bangsar constituency . It is thought by some historians that Finance Minister and MCA President Tan Siew Sin 's appeal to the Chinese to avoid challenging the Malay special rights and risk merger with Indonesia helped the MCA retain its status as the " undisputed leader of the Chinese in the Malayan peninsula " . Nevertheless , UMNO leaders were furious with the PAP . 
 New problems soon cropped up . Lee Kuan Yew , the leader of the Singaporean government and the PAP , declared his open opposition to ketuanan Melayu , calling for a " Malaysian Malaysia " instead of the implied Malay Malaysia . He argued that " Malays began to migrate to Malaysia in noticeable numbers only about 700 years ago . Of the 39 % Malays in Malaysia today , about one @-@ third are comparatively new immigrants like ( Syed Jaafar Albar ) , who came to Malaya from Indonesia just before the war at the age of more than thirty . Therefore it is wrong and illogical for a particular racial group to think that they are more justified to be called Malaysians and that the others can become Malaysian only through their favour . " 
 Lee later lamented : " Malaysia — to whom does it belong ? To Malaysians . But who are Malaysians ? I hope I am , Mr Speaker , Sir . But sometimes , sitting in this chamber , I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian . This is the doubt that hangs over many minds , and ... [ once ] emotions are set in motion , and men pitted against men along these unspoken lines , you will have the kind of warfare that will split the nation from top to bottom and undo Malaysia . " At times , however , Lee worsened things by making racial comments of his own . Many of his speeches harped on the ethnic composition of Malaysia , reminding listeners that the non @-@ Malays were now in the majority , with 61 % of the population to the Malays ' 39 % asking at one point , " Why should we go back to old Singapore and once again reduce the non @-@ Malays in Malaya to a minority ? " Lee exacerbated deteriorating PAP @-@ UMNO relations by constantly demanding that the federal government " smack down their ' ultras ' " , whose ranks included prominent UMNO leaders such as Syed Jaafar Albar and Syed Nasir Ismail . 
 Lee 's statements upset many , especially Alliance politicians . Tan Siew Sin called him the " greatest , disruptive force in the entire history of Malaysia and Malaya . " The Tunku considered Lee too extremist in his views , while other UMNO politicians thought Lee was simply pandering to Malaysian Chinese with his rhetoric . Lee 's statement about allegedly recent Malay migration met with stinging rebuttals ; Albar declared : " To say that the Malays are in the same category as other races is an insult ... " The UMNO newspaper Malaya Merdeka warned : " If the Malays are hard @-@ pressed and their interests are not protected , " they would merge Malaysia with Indonesia . It was this that the Tunku feared the most . To him , the ultras were not the real extremists — it was those who sought a " Greater Indonesia " to " fix " the Chinese that were the real threat . 
 The strain in race relations led to the Singaporean 1964 Race Riots , which PAP Malay politician Othman Wok later insinuated were planned beforehand by the ultras . In the year following the riots , tension continued growing . Syed Jaafar Albar declared that " Wherever I am , I am a Malay " , drawing harsh return fire from Lee , who stated in Parliament : " If I had been going round and saying what [ he ] has been saying — wherever I am , I am a Chinese — where would we be ? But I keep on reminding the people that I am a Malaysian . I am learning Bahasa Kebangsaan [ Malay , the national language ] and I accept Article 153 of the Constitution . " 
 Lee insisted that he was not opposed to Malay special rights or Article 153 , saying : " if the immigrant communities ... do not see the problems , if they can 't feel what it is like to be a poor Malay , and don 't feel for him , then I can say very soon he will manifest his disaffection in a very decisive way and the whole country will be thrown into turmoil . " Few from the Alliance took this claim seriously . UMNO politicians insisted that a " Malaysian Malaysia " implied total equality , entailing the removal of Malay privileges . Senu Abdul Rahman , a federal Minister , felt Lee 's advocacy of equality would deny the Malays the possibility of economic participation : " What we want is opportunity , the opportunity to obtain economic wealth for our people . " <unk> Lee for stating he was a Malaysian by his own right , Senu asked : " The right which Lee is enjoying today did not fall from the sky or out of the blue . It was given to him . Doesn 't he have some feeling of gratitude to the natives of this country ? " Lee answered : " No , I am not enjoying anyone 's hospitality . I am here as of right . And 61 per cent of the people of Malaysia have to stand by that or it is lost . Without it they would have no future . " Some , such as Syed Jaafar Albar , took Senu 's stance further and referred to the Malays , as the Bumiputra , as " masters of the house " , whose hospitality was being abused by the <unk> asing ( aliens ) or orang <unk> ( lodgers ) such as Lee . This provoked a response from Cabinet member Lim Swee Aun insisting " we are co @-@ owners , not lodgers , not guests . " 
 Some went against the common view held in UMNO . Ismail Abdul Rahman told Parliament that " ... both the Alliance and the PAP subscribe to the concept of a Malaysian Malaysia , " but differed in their methods . Ismail characterised the PAP 's approach as " non @-@ communalism straightaway , " while the Alliance required " two steps . First , inter @-@ racial harmony ; second , and ultimate state of non @-@ communalism . " Such statements were dismissed by Lee as lip service that could not be taken seriously unless the ultras were reined in . 
 = = = Separation = = = 
 Lee continued his campaign , forming the Malaysian Solidarity Council ( MSC ) comprising multi @-@ racial parties such as the PAP , the People 's Progressive Party ( PPP ) and the United Democratic Party ( UDP ) in 1965 . At the MSC 's first and only general meeting , several leaders from these parties gave speeches supporting a Malaysian Malaysia . D.R. <unk> of the PPP accused the Alliance of using Article 153 to " bully non @-@ Malays " , while Ong Kee Hui of the Sarawak United People 's Party ( SUPP ) said that " We see an attitude of intolerance and mounting signs of denial of political equality to people who are non @-@ Malays . For the sake of our country and ourselves , this must be stopped and the drift to narrow racialism checked . Political equality should be accorded to all who live here and make this country their home , irrespective of their racial origin . " 
 Soon after , UMNO backbencher Mahathir bin Mohamad attacked Lee in Parliament : " [ The Singaporean Chinese ] have never known Malay rule and cannot bear the idea that the people they have so long kept under their heels should now be in a position to rule them . " Lee responded with an unscripted speech made entirely in Malay opposing the government 's pro @-@ Malay policies : " Of course there are Chinese millionaires in big cars and big houses . Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses ? ... If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights , where are we going to end up ? You let people in the villages believe that they are poor because we don 't speak Malay , because the government does not write in Malay , so he expects a miracle to take place [ when Malay becomes the sole national language ] . The moment we all start speaking Malay , he is going to have an uplift in the standard of living , and if doesn 't happen , what happens then ? Meanwhile , whenever there is a failure of economic , social and educational policies , you come back and say , oh , these wicked Chinese , Indian and others opposing Malay rights . They don 't oppose Malay rights . They , the Malay , have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies , the non @-@ Malay society , has produced . That is what must be done , isn 't it ? Not to feed them with this <unk> doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved . " 
 Eventually , the Tunku — fed up with all the politicking and convinced that any further clashes of rhetoric would only degenerate into violence — asked Singapore to secede . Singapore became an independent nation in 1965 , with Lee as its first Prime Minister . Although Article 152 of the Constitution of Singapore names the Malays as " indigenous people " of Singapore and mandates special safeguarding of their rights and privileges , the article does not specify any policies for such safeguarding . 
 Some later blamed the formation of Malaysia for strengthening ketuanan Melayu : " A reinforcement of Malay rights — which during the previous five or six years [ prior to the formation of Malaysia ] had been withering away as the Reid Commission might have suspected they would — took place against a background of general unequal treatment " after Malaysia 's formation .

 = = = Issues of language = = = 
 The Constitution specified a ten @-@ year delay after independence in changing the national language from English to Malay . As the scheduled date in 1967 drew near some Chinese began to agitate for a more liberal language policy permitting some instances of Mandarin in public affairs . Extremists from UMNO and PAS lashed out against them , but the Alliance proposed a compromise in the National Language Bill establishing Malay as the official language , but permitting English under certain circumstances and the use of non @-@ Malay languages for non @-@ official purposes . The Tunku described it as " a course guaranteeing peace " , but the Bill was widely derided by many Malays , who formed the National Language Action Front in hope of repealing or amending it . The leadership of the Tunku was also openly questioned . 
 = = = 13 May = = = 
 In 1969 , a general election was held . It was the first to be contested on a major scale by non @-@ Malay @-@ based opposition parties , other than the 1964 election where the PAP challenged the Alliance in Peninsular Malaysia . The two main opposition parties on this front in 1969 were the Democratic Action Party ( DAP ) — the Malaysian successor to the PAP , widely seen as Chinese @-@ based — and the Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia ( Gerakan ) , an ostensibly multiracial party led by former MCA stalwart , Lim Chong Eu , and other middle @-@ class intellectuals like Tan Chee Khoon and Syed Hussein Alatas . Both proposed policies on language , education , and Malay rights that were diametrically opposed to those of the government , with the DAP continuing where Lee Kuan Yew had left off with the " Malaysian Malaysia " campaign . Some , mostly from the DAP , called for the elevation of English , Mandarin and Tamil to official language status , along with Malay . Stronger government support for the Chinese education stream was also demanded . 
 PAS , on the other hand , attempted to garner votes by accusing UMNO of selling out the Malays ' indigenous rights to " pendatang asing " . When the results were released , PAS had made minor inroads , but the DAP and Gerakan managed to topple the Alliance from power in three states , and nearly eradicated the Alliance 's traditional two @-@ thirds majority in Parliament . A large part of these gains came at the expense of the MCA , which soon announced that it would not participate in the new government after the election , as the MCA no longer had a mandate to represent Chinese interests in the government . The jubilant DAP and Gerakan organised victory parades in the national capital of Kuala Lumpur on 11 and 12 May , where participants taunted the Malays while bearing slogans such as " <unk> Melayu <unk> <unk> " ( " Finish off all the Malays " ) . An apology was issued soon after the rallies . Nevertheless , the shocked Malays blamed Chinese voters for betraying " the Alliance formula by voting for an opposition that had revived fundamental questions of language and Malay special rights " . 
 Malay extremists welcomed the MCA 's move , feeling an <unk> and Malay @-@ dominated government would better serve their purposes . UMNO held its own rally , which soon became a riot , on 13 May . This would later be euphemistically labelled as the " 13 May Incident " . UMNO supporters gathered at Harun 's house on the evening of 13 May , where the rally was due to start , with many brandishing <unk> ( machetes ) and other weapons . Some leaders condemned the " insults " of the " infidels " at the previous victory parades , calling the counter @-@ rally a means " to teach the Chinese a lesson " for challenging Malay supremacy . Soon , the crowd began attacking passing Chinese motorists , and launched arson attacks on Chinese homes and shops . The rioting spread , and , despite the military being called in , continued for another two days . 
 As a result of the riots , Parliament was suspended , and a state of national emergency was declared . A National Operations Council ( NOC ) was formed to oversee the administration of the country under emergency rule . Although the rioting had died down , tensions continued to simmer . A non @-@ Malay boycott of Malay goods and services received " near total " support , while many Malays , such as Mahathir Mohamad and Raja <unk> Daim began calling for an autocracy led by UMNO alone , and the removal of the Tunku . According to some sources , one group of " ultras " , comprising Syed Nasir Ismail , Musa Hitam , and Tengku Razaleigh , felt that the power @-@ sharing Constitution had failed , and agreed that the country had to be " returned " to the Malays . They allegedly agreed to summon Mahathir to Kuala Lumpur , where he led his anti @-@ Tunku campaign . 
 Mahathir wrote an open letter to the Tunku , accusing him of " giving the Chinese what they demand ... you have given them too much face . " Soon , students at higher educational institutions across the country began to hold mass demonstrations , calling for the Tunku to step down in favour of a leader who would restore " Malay sovereignty " . Sporadic rioting , believed to have been instigated by the Tunku 's opponents , broke out . 
 Instead of bowing to their demands , the Tunku had Mahathir and Musa Hitam expelled from UMNO . The Minister of Home Affairs , Ismail Abdul Rahman , alleged that " These ultras believe in the wild and fantastic theory of absolute dominion by one race over the other communities , regardless of the Constitution . ... <unk> has taken place in Malaysian politics and the extreme racialists among the ruling party are making a desperate bid to topple the present leadership . " 
 = = = The Malay Dilemma and New Economic Policy = = = 
 Mahathir spent his political exile writing The Malay Dilemma , where he contended " that the Malays are the original or indigenous people of Malaya and the only people who can claim Malaya as their one and only country . In accordance with practice all over the world , this confers on the Malays certain inalienable rights over the forms and obligations of citizenship which can be imposed on citizens of non @-@ indigenous origin . " ( Referring to the social contract . ) 
 Mahathir expressed discomfort with " far too many non @-@ Malay citizens who can swamp the Malays " when " ... suddenly it has dawned upon the Malay that he cannot even call Malaya his land . There is no more Tanah Melayu — land of the Malays . He is now a different person , a Malaysian , but a Malay Malaysian whose authority in Malaya — his land — is now not only shared with others , but shared unequally . And as if this is not enough , he is being asked to give up more and more of his share of influence . " Mahathir 's defence of Malay rights focused both on the " definitive people " line of reasoning and the argument in favour of affirmative action , which the Reid Commission had chosen : " It is not ... for reasons of Malay superiority that preferential treatment for Malays in scholarship awards was insisted upon . ... They are a means of breaking down the superior position of the non @-@ Malays in the field of education . The Malays are not proud of this treatment . " Shortly after becoming Prime Minister , Mahathir denied he had altered any of his views since he wrote the book . 
 Mahathir and Musa Hitam later rejoined UMNO and the government under Tun Abdul Razak , the second Prime Minister , whose New Economic Policy ( NEP ) , was based on some of the reforms Mahathir 's book had advocated . The NEP 's stated goal was elimination of " the identification of race with economic function " . To achieve this , it targeted a 30 % share of the economy for the " Bumiputra " — " sons of the soil , " a term referring to Malays and other indigenous peoples — by 1990 . This became known as the " 30 per cent solution " setting the " Bumiputra quota " for many items , including new public share listings and new private housing schemes . Certain commentators alleged that this fostered " a close to ' zero @-@ sum ' attitude chiefly between the Malays and Chinese " . The NEP 's stated aim , however , was not to directly redistribute wealth but to enlarge the economic pie while providing a larger share of the gains for Malays , thus increasing participation in the economy for all . 
 The main rationale for the NEP as set out in the Second Malaysia Plan was to address the " economic imbalance " between the Chinese and Malays . In 1969 , the Malay share of equity reportedly stood at 1 @.@ 5 % while the Chinese held 22 @.@ 8 % ; the rest was largely in foreign hands . Some detractors argued that while the Chinese share of the economy had increased at the Malays ' expense , more significant growth in inequality had occurred between the richest and poorest Malays — between 1957 and 1970 , the wealthiest 20 % of Malays ' share in the Malay portion of the economy reportedly increased from 42 @.@ 5 % to 52 @.@ 5 % while the poorest 40 % saw a decrease from 19 @.@ 5 % to 12 @.@ 7 % . 
 The NOC issued a report of its own analysing the root causes of the 13 May violence , suggesting that even in the civil service , a traditional Malay employer , non @-@ Malays outnumbered the Malays in many areas , with substantial Malay majorities only in the Police and Armed Forces . The report concluded : " Allegations that the non @-@ Malays are excluded are regarded by the Malays as deliberate distortion . The Malays who already felt excluded in the country 's economic life , now began to feel a threat to their place in the public services . No mention was ever made by non @-@ Malay politicians of the almost closed @-@ door attitude to the Malays by non @-@ Malays in large sections of the private sector in this country . " 
 According to the Second Malaysia Plan , the NEP aimed to " create a Malay commercial and industrial community " through " wholly owned enterprises and joint ventures " . Prior to this , the government had , in the words of a local economist , played " administrative , supportive , and regulatory " roles in attempting to address the economic imbalance , but avoided " represent [ ing ] direct and active efforts in promoting " Malay interests . Now , the government would not only " [ limit ] access of the Chinese and Indian population to universities , public jobs and public money , " but also actively intervene in the economy to give " [ the Bumiputra ] a bigger piece of the business action " . One criticism of this increased intervention was that UMNO supposedly " became a major beneficiary of the expanded role of the state " . 
 There had been limited affirmative action programmes before . However , these mostly focused on the civil service , as Article 153 of the Constitution did . Admission to higher education was largely merit @-@ based . The Tunku government preferred laissez @-@ faire policies , minimising economic intervention . Although some agencies , such as the Rural Industrial Development Agency ( <unk> ) , which attempted to aid Malay entrepreneurs , existed , their programs were criticised as being based on handouts and favouring the politically connected . <unk> was renamed as the Majlis <unk> Rakyat ( The Indigenous People 's Trust Council ) or MARA in 1965 , and came to symbolise the development of Malay entrepreneurship . 
 Although the NEP was aimed at addressing economic imbalances , it soon became associated with ketuanan Melayu . While the two were rarely directly equated , they were often mentioned together , with the implication that the NEP was derived from ketuanan Melayu . The NEP 's greater intervention in the economy led some to " equate UMNO 's monolithic image as the undisputed champion of Malay supremacy with the party 's ability to shore up lucrative business deals . " 
 = = = Constitutional amendments and other policy changes = = = 
 Parliament finally reconvened again in 1971 . Although the NEP was passed without its approval , Parliament 's consent was required to amend the Constitution . The government @-@ tabled Constitution ( Amendment ) Act 1971 , in conjunction with some amendments to the Sedition Act , limited freedom of speech on " sensitive issues " such as the national language , Malay special rights , the Malay rulers , and the provisions for citizenship . These restrictions also applied to Members of Parliament , over @-@ ruling their previous Parliamentary immunity . The amendments also clarified Article 152 's meaning , and included the " natives of any of the States of Sabah and Sarawak " under Article 153 , extending the formerly Malay @-@ only rights to all Bumiputra . In addition , the Yang di @-@ Pertuan Agong ( King ) could now direct any university or college to implement a proportion @-@ based quota system favouring the Bumiputra . All higher educational institutions immediately enacted quota systems on the orders of the Education Ministry ; some later questioned the move 's constitutionality on the grounds that the King himself had not issued any directive . 
 To cap all this , the amendment of articles touching on the " sensitive issues " mentioned , as well as the clause governing this rule on amendments , was forbidden without the consent of the Conference of Rulers . Effectively entrenching the " sensitive " Articles , this was heavily criticised by opposition MPs . It was claimed that if Parliament could be prevented from discussing particular issue , Parliamentary sovereignty was undermined . It was also unclear if the ban from speaking on " sensitive issues " applied to the ban itself . Nevertheless , the provisions were passed . The Internal Security Act ( ISA ) , which effectively allows the government to detain anyone it deems a threat to national security for an indefinite period without judicial review , was also amended in 1971 to stress the " preservation of intercommunal harmony " . 
 Many of these changes saw fierce opposition in Parliament and abroad . When the proposed changes were first announced , the British press charged they would " preserve as immutable the feudal system dominating Malay society " by " giving this archaic body of petty constitutional monarchs incredible blocking power " . The censorship of sensitive issues was labelled as paradoxical when contrasted with Tun Abdul Razak 's speaking of " the full realization that important matters must no longer be swept under the carpet ... " Other critics argued that Article 153 was nothing more than a " paper rice bowl " , and in any case , did not even include the orang <unk> ( literally Malay for " native people " ) or aborigines within the scope of its privileges , rendering its rationale somewhat suspect . 
 Another important policy change came in the field of education . In 1970 , the government made Malay the medium of instruction for primary , secondary , and tertiary education , replacing English . Although government funding for the Chinese and Tamil education streams continued , many non @-@ Malays considered this new policy to be " the most discriminatory " thus far . The government 's rationale was that this would provide better educational opportunities for the Malays , especially those who formerly had to make the transition from Malay @-@ medium primary and secondary schools to English @-@ medium universities . It was also argued that uniting students under one language would provide for greater racial harmony , while indirectly underscoring the " Malay nature of the state " . 
 The same year that the medium of instruction was changed to Malay , the National Culture Policy ( NCP ) was announced . Syed Nasir Ismail described the government 's policies as aimed at creating a " Bumiputra Muslim identity " ( <unk> Islam <unk> ) for Malaysians . In essence , the NCP 's goal was to eventually assimilate the non @-@ indigenous peoples into an indigenous Malaysian identity . Despite stiff opposition from Chinese pressure groups , the government refused to withdraw the NCP . To foster national unity , the Rukunegara , or national ideology , was also introduced . Although the Rukunegara itself contains no references to ketuanan Melayu or the social contract , a government commentary mentioned the " position of Malays and other Natives , the legitimate interests of the other communities , and the conferment of citizenship " as key aspects of the Constitution while insisting : " No citizen should question the loyalty of another citizen on the ground that he belongs to a particular community . " One political pundit described it as a formal declaration of the social contract or " Racial Bargain " . 
 = = = Politics and " Malay dominance " = = = 
 The old Alliance model , where each race was represented by one party , was repudiated with the formation of the Barisan Nasional ( BN , or the National Front ) in 1974 . Several former opposition parties , including Gerakan , the PPP and PAS , joined the UMNO @-@ led BN . Although the MCA and MIC were included , their influence was diluted by other non @-@ Malay parties in the coalition . In 1977 , PAS ' expulsion left UMNO as the sole Malay representative in BN , although some ostensibly multiracial parties provided token Malay representation . After its departure , PAS took a different approach to Malay privileges , denouncing the NEP as racial discrimination and " <unk> " . 
 In 1974 , Mahathir was appointed as a Minister in Tun Razak 's Cabinet . He became the Deputy Prime Minister just two years later , under Tun Hussein Onn , who had succeeded Tun Razak upon the latter 's sudden death . 
 During the 1970s — the heyday of the NEP — " Malay dominance " was a largely accepted fact of life for Malaysians . Whereas the 1957 to 1969 period was viewed as a time when " Malay dominance " was at least tempered by a form of " inter @-@ ethnic bargaining " within the Alliance government , from the 13 May Incident onwards , political pundits argued that the political environment was now under marked " hegemonic control " from the Malays and UMNO ; in 1970 , one Cabinet member pronounced that Malay special rights would remain for " hundreds of years to come " . The Tunku observed in 1977 that " it appears in the minds of the non @-@ Bumiputras that they are being turned into second @-@ class citizens in the country . " The government 's ethnic policies continued to be based on and justified by the two basic arguments Mahathir had applied in his Dilemma ; the " historical " status of Malay primacy over Malaya , and the " special needs " of the Malays . As public discussion or questioning of these issues had been criminalised , there were few locally published works critically discussing Malay supremacy , complicating attempts to evaluate it or establish further grounds for government policy beyond the main two traditionally put forth . 
 The ultras who had allegedly plotted to exploit the post @-@ 13 May chaos were now in control of the country . Razaleigh , the Finance Minister , was hailed as the " Father of the Bumiputra Economy " . Musa Hitam and Mahathir , both rising stars on the political scene , maintained their image as " ultras " , although it is unclear if this was their intention . Journalist K. Das once claimed Musa had told him " that a young Malaysian politician has to play the race card to the hilt even if there was not a single chauvinistic bone in his body . " After retiring , Musa said that " the national leaders tend to look for a scapegoat when faced with a desperate crisis situation " and use racial tactics to fill their " empty stomach " . 
 UMNO Youth in particular maintained its " ultra " image from the 1960s . One of its Vice @-@ Presidents said in response to discussion of opening different teams in UMNO based on political ideology that " The original cause of UMNO is to fight for the interests of the Malay race and this must continue . We do not want factions in UMNO . " In 1980 , Tun Hussein Onn announced that he would be handing power over to Mahathir due to poor health . Mahathir took office in 1981 , with Musa Hitam as his deputy . 
 = = Mahathir administration = = 
 = = = Affirmative action and Chinese protests = = = 
 The affirmative action policies of the NEP continued under Mahathir . Political pundits considered this administration , in its early period , to be a continuation of the " hegemonic control " of Malaysian politics by the Malays , and by UMNO in particular . During this time , Mahathir focused on consolidating his power within UMNO and the government . As a result , there was little active confrontation between the Malays and the non @-@ Malays on the issue of ketuanan Melayu at the time . 
 In 1981 , the MCA assessed the NEP and other government policies from a Chinese point of view . Its findings expressed concern over a number of problems , including alleged disrespect of the citizenship of the Malaysian Chinese and the Malay @-@ dominated civil service , claiming the NEP 's goal of eradicating identification of race with economic function had been abrogated . In addition , it was argued that non @-@ Malays were under @-@ represented in Parliament and the Cabinet because of gerrymandering ; mostly Malay rural Parliamentary constituencies outnumbered heterogeneous urban constituencies , despite the total population of urban constituencies exceeding that of rural ones . However , UMNO avoided directly confronting the MCA over the issue . 
 Tensions rose after the 1986 general election when it appeared that UMNO on its own commanded a working Parliamentary majority , allowing it to govern without the support of other parties . Several UMNO leaders seriously discussed the possibility of governing alone ; one , Abdullah Ahmad , publicly espoused permanent Malay supremacy and relegating non @-@ Malays to second @-@ class citizenship . Such calls for <unk> were eventually disregarded , and the Barisan Nasional government continued . However , some UMNO officials warned non @-@ Malay parties to avoid " playing with fire " by questioning the Malays ' special rights and privileges or Hak <unk> Orang Melayu . At the UMNO General Assembly that year , Mahathir stated : " We do not wish to rob other people of their rights . But let no one try to rob us of our rights . " When Parliament reconvened , the DAP began raising objections to what they alleged was the division of Malaysians into " first and second class citizens " . In response , some UMNO MPs began referring to the non @-@ Malays as pendatang asing ( foreign immigrants , or aliens ) in Parliament . When the DAP attempted to enquire about the distribution of economic equity among the races to evaluate the NEP 's progress , the Standing Orders of Parliament were amended to forbid such inquiries . This led the DAP to allege that the NEP 's aims had been met , and that it could be allowed to expire in 1990 . 
 Some , such as Petaling Jaya city councillor Richard Yeoh , believe that Abdullah Ahmad , an aide of Mahathir 's , was the first to use the term " ketuanan Melayu " . Yeoh described the context in which Ahmad used it as " a fairly benign speech and most of us might have had no problem with it , but it has been taken to mean Malay supremacy by some <unk> leaders who don 't necessarily know what it means . " 
 Ethnic tension continued to grow shortly after Mahathir narrowly defeated Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah for the UMNO Presidency in 1987 . Around this time , several deposit @-@ taking co @-@ operatives ( <unk> ) , some associated with the MCA , collapsed . To save Chinese investors , the MCA asked the government to bail out the <unk> , citing a previous bailout of Bumiputra financial institutions . UMNO 's reluctance to acquiesce led MCA Deputy President Lee Kim Sai to warn that the MCA might quit the government . Later that year , the government posted several non @-@ Chinese @-@ educated staff to senior positions in Chinese vernacular schools . Anwar Ibrahim , then Education Minister , refused to yield to protests from the MCA , and stated that the decision was final , despite a previous informal agreement on the issue between the Malay and Chinese communities . 
 The Gerakan , MCA and DAP held rallies and boycotted classes in Chinese primary schools to protest the move ; UMNO Youth held its own rallies to assert ketuanan Melayu , hosting banners with slogans such as " revoke the citizenship of those who opposed the Malay rulers " , " 13 May has begun " , and " soak it [ the keris , a Malay dagger ] with Chinese blood " . Future Deputy Prime Minister and then UMNO Youth Chief Najib Razak ( the son of Tun Razak ) threatened to bathe a keris with Chinese blood . The flames were fanned further when in an unrelated incident , a Malay soldier ran amok in a predominantly Chinese area , killing one and injuring another two . 
 The government then launched Operation <unk> ( <unk> Operation ) , detaining 55 people under the ISA . More were arrested over the next few months . Although most were opposition politicians — including Parliamentary Opposition Leader Lim Kit Siang — a few from BN were included . All BN politicians were released from detention after two months , while those from the opposition remained in custody for much longer . The government later justified these detentions on grounds of security , stating that the detainees had played up the issue of Chinese education to incite racial sentiment . Some of Mahathir 's supporters saw this as a vindication of his rejection of the Tunku 's " compromise " with the non @-@ Malays , teaching the non @-@ Malays not to criticise the government and its pro @-@ Malay policies . 
 Many critics did not take this explanation seriously . UMNO was in crisis at the time , with Mahathir 's faction narrowly defeating Razaleigh 's in the party elections . Razaleigh 's supporters filed a lawsuit alleging irregularities in the election process which appeared likely to succeed , triggering new party elections . In this context , one MCA politician charged that the government had pursued a " hidden agenda , " deflecting public attention from UMNO 's crisis with a " deviation in the implementation of the Chinese education policy . " The Tunku himself claimed that Mahathir used the issue to mobilise the Malays " as a united force to a common enemy — and the imaginary enemy in this case was the Chinese community . " 
 In the end , Mahathir 's camp " won " the court case when it was held that as the party was an illegal organisation under the Societies Act due to some of its branches not being formally registered , the plaintiffs ' case was invalid ; an illegal society could not hold new elections for its leaders . Mahathir immediately set up " UMNO ( Baru ) " ( New UMNO ) , transferring all of old UMNO 's assets to the new party . Most of his supporters also joined UMNO ( Baru ) , and eventually the " ( Baru ) " was dropped , making it , for all intents and purposes , the same as the old UMNO . When the Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal on the case , the government suspended and later sacked Lord President Salleh Abas and five other Supreme Court judges , triggering the 1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis . The new Supreme Court later dismissed the case . 
 Razaleigh then formed the Semangat 46 ( Spirit of ' 46 ) party to challenge the government . In the 1990 general election , ketuanan Melayu was used as an issue , with UMNO accusing Semangat 46 , PAS , the DAP and other opposition parties of conspiring to end Malay supremacy . The government also repeatedly warned that the 13 May riots would be repeated if it did not maintain its two @-@ thirds majority in Parliament . Full @-@ page advertisements depicting bloodshed and carnage were published in major national newspapers . Tensions rose further when the Tunku called on voters to support Semangat 46 instead of the new UMNO , with several UMNO politicians demanding that his title of " Bapa Kemerdekaan " ( Father of Independence ) be withdrawn , and his statue removed from Parliament House . Despite this , the government retained its two @-@ thirds Parliamentary majority , with Semangat 46 winning only eight seats . 
 = = = Reviewing and reworking economic policies = = = 
 Prior to the expiration of the NEP in 1990 , there was much debate over whether the policy should be renewed , replaced , or scrapped altogether . The government organised an official review of the NEP in the years leading up to its expiration . The NEP had been faced with a number of criticisms throughout its lifetime , most of them related to political corruption and other inefficiencies . 
 One point of dispute was the calculation of Malay equity . Although officially , as of 1992 , the Malays controlled 18 % of the economy , some dismissed this figure as misleading . It was argued that as in reality , much of this amount comprised equity held by government agencies , therefore it belonged to Malaysians as a whole . The practice of awarding public works contracts mainly to Bumiputras was argued to be stifling Malay competency by providing little incentive to improve . Many Bumiputra contractors in turn subcontracted their jobs to others , who were in some cases Chinese ; " Ali Baba " arrangements with " the Malay [ Ali ] using his privileges to acquire licences and permits denied the non @-@ Malay , then accepting a fee to be the front @-@ man while the non @-@ Malay [ Baba ] ran the business , " were prevalent . Some suggested that the NEP " might have worked , if the Malay had actually wanted to learn the ropes . But more often than not , he just wanted to be rich . " 
 Some said the disbursement of shares favoured the politically connected , many of whom immediately sold the shares at market price , reaping the arbitrage instead of holding on and increasing the Malay share of equity , which the policy was intended to do . Although the NEP managed to create a class of Malay millionaires , it was charged that this was mainly due to cronyism , benefiting only the politically connected . Some agreed , but argued against taking action ; one PAS politician stated : " The Malays do not want justice to affect their interests . " Other commentators have suggested that although most of the benefits under the NEP accrued to the politically connected , the government intended for them to " trickle down to the Malay masses " , and also for the Malay nouveau riche to provide " entrepreneurial role models " for other Malays . 
 During the 1980s , concern continued to grow about discrimination in higher education . At this point , the Education Minister told Parliament of " dissatisfaction " and " disappointment " among non @-@ Malays concerning " lessening opportunities " for higher education . Later in 1997 , then Education Minister Najib Tun Razak defended the quotas as necessary , claiming that only 5 % of all local undergraduates would be Malays if quotas were abolished . 
 Another criticism was that the NEP and other affirmative action had actually reduced the Malays ' self @-@ confidence , despite Mahathir 's intention of building a Malay business class to serve as role models for impoverished Malays . One Malay journalist opined : " [ U ] <unk> this New Economic Policy , no Bumiputra could ever be sure that such ' victories ' as came his way were fully deserved . " The NEP was also criticised for seeking to improve the Malays ' overall share of the economy , even if this share were to be held by a small number of Malays . Some quarters accused the NEP of being too heavy @-@ handed in its approach towards affirmative action , maintaining it had " deprived qualified non @-@ Malays of opportunities for higher education and job promotions " and forcing many non @-@ Malays to emigrate instead . This , combined with the impressions of the NEP as corrupt and associated with ketuanan Melayu , led to " deep resentment " , particularly among the Chinese . The NEP was criticised as " set [ ting ] those Malaysians so honoured with it above the rest , granting them the preferential treatment of the NEP , " while " <unk> [ ing ] Malaysians into first- and second @-@ class citizens " . 
 In 1990 , the NEP was replaced by the National Development Policy ( NDP ) , which continued most of the NEP @-@ era policies . The Malay share of the economy , though substantially larger , was not near the 30 % target according to government figures . In its review of the NEP , the government found that although income inequality had been reduced , some important targets related to overall Malay corporate ownership had not been met . Both Mahathir and the Tunku had expressed concern that the Malays remained too reliant on the Chinese economically . 
 Claims that the NEP had retarded economic growth were dismissed ; it was posited that the NEP had managed to avert further racial rioting , which would have hurt economic growth more than the NEP . The NEP was also defended as having created a Malay middle class and improving standards of living without compromising the non @-@ Bumiputra share of the economy in absolute terms ; statistics indicated that the Chinese and Indian middle classes also grew under the NEP , albeit not as much as the Malays ' . The overall Malaysian poverty rate had shrunk from 50 % at independence to 7 % . It was also argued that ethnic stereotypes had been largely stamped out due to the NEP 's success in creating a Malay upper class . Although many of the NEP 's goals were restated by the NDP , the new policy appeared to be geared more towards wealth retention and creation , as opposed to simple redistribution . Nevertheless , many of the policies from the NEP era were retained under the NDP , which was set to expire in 2020 . 
 = = = Bangsa Malaysia and political liberalisation = = = 
 During the 1990s , Mahathir and UMNO made a public about @-@ face on the government 's cultural policies , with the formation of the Wawasan 2020 ( Vision 2020 ) and Bangsa Malaysia ( Malaysian Race ) plans . Mahathir named one obstacle to establishing Malaysia as a developed nation by the year 2020 as : " the challenge of establishing a matured , liberal and tolerant society in which Malaysians of all colours and creeds are free to practice and profess their customs , cultures and religious beliefs and yet feeling that they belong to one nation . " Mahathir proposed the establishment of " one Bangsa Malaysia with political loyalty and dedication to the nation " . After the government 's 1995 general election victory , Mahathir elaborated : " Bangsa Malaysia means people who are able to identify themselves with the country , speak Bahasa Malaysia ( the Malaysian or Malay language ) and accept the Constitution . " 
 Mahathir later explained that " The idea before was that people should become 100 per cent Malay in order to be Malaysian . We now accept that this is a multi @-@ racial country . We should build bridges instead of trying to remove completely the barriers separating us . " Such a dramatic change was perceived by the non @-@ Malay communities as a " complete retraction " of earlier policies emphasising assimilation of non @-@ Malays . The government took measures to stress this change , decreasing emphasis on Malay as the one and only national language by permitting local universities to use English as the medium of instruction for certain subjects . Diplomas from the MCA @-@ sponsored and Chinese @-@ majority Tunku Abdul Rahman College ( TARC ) were officially recognised by the government for employment in the civil service . For the first time , religions other than Islam were given airtime on state radio and television , although they were not allowed to proselytise . Lion dances — a traditional Chinese performance which had been banned for decades — were not only permitted but even attended by Mahathir and other top government officials . 
 Although the early 1990s saw marked economic growth , commentators suggested that Mahathir 's liberal policies had played the key role in his popularity and the Barisan Nasional 's landslide 1995 election victory . One pundit wrote that " Most Malaysians could not remember a time of greater prosperity or lesser inter @-@ ethnic recrimination . ... Economic indicators alone would not have captured the pride that Malaysians had discovered , perhaps for [ the ] first time , in being Malaysian . " 
 Lim Kit Siang attributed the opposition 's defeat to Mahathir 's liberalism and the government 's adoption of the DAP 's stance on issues like " language , culture and education " . Some , however , doubted Mahathir 's sincerity . One UMNO Youth official suggested that " The Barisan government 's flexible move ... only shows that we are enjoying the highest level of tolerance purely based on the level of confidence in terms of political and economic position of the Malays . We share the political power with the Chinese . When they need to increase their political support from their community it is very important for them to serve the main concerns of the Chinese . So , why shouldn 't we allow that ? We can ... achieve a win @-@ win situation . This is a purely political move . ... Similarly we UMNO Youth have to be often seen as a very racialist political group fighting for the Malay interests . ... However , those finished agendas that we have done , such as Islam , Bahasa Melayu [ the Malay language ] and the special status of the Malays , should not be questioned in any circumstance because these are very sensitive issues . " 
 In the latter part of the 1990s , government policies were loosened to combat the Asian economic crisis by encouraging foreign investment . In 1999 , a new opposition party supported by Mahathir 's former deputy , Anwar Ibrahim ( who had been jailed for sodomy after his controversial sacking ) led to a revival of the " 13 May " warnings . However , the government maintained its Parliamentary majority . In 2003 , Mahathir officially resigned as Prime Minister , and was succeeded by his deputy , Abdullah Ahmad Badawi .

 Prior to Abdullah 's ascension in 2003 , although ketuanan Melayu had been enunciated by several prominent Malay leaders , it had not been given a proper name . Around this time , the term " ketuanan Melayu " — " <unk> " being the Malay word for " lord " or " master " — came into common usage , even entering the government @-@ approved secondary school curriculum . Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia professor of sociology <unk> Othman has said that the term is evocative of " notions of enslavement , " since " In Malay classical terms , the word ' ketuanan ' implies lordship over captives , which is a pre @-@ feudal concept that is out of sync in 1957 , 1963 and today . " 
 A government @-@ approved secondary school history textbook published in 2004 by Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka , the government @-@ owned publishing company , defined ketuanan Melayu as : 
 Semangat cinta <unk> apa <unk> yang <unk> dengan <unk> Melayu <unk> hak <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , adat <unk> dan tanah air . <unk> Tanah Melayu <unk> <unk> tanah <unk> orang Melayu . 
 Its English translation is as follows : 
 A passion for all that is related to the Malay race , such as political rights , language , culture , heritage , tradition and the homeland . The Malay peninsula is regarded as the Malays ' land by birthright . 
 In 2003 , the United Malays National Organisation ( UMNO ) political party Youth Information Chief Azimi Daim stated : " In Malaysia , everybody knows that Malays are the masters of this land . We rule this country as provided for in the federal constitution . Any one who touches upon Malay affairs or criticizes Malays is [ offending ] our sensitivities . " 
 Although its proponents claimed that ketuanan Melayu was directly derived from Article 153 of the Constitution , the Reid Commission which drafted the framework for the Constitution had stated that the provisions for Malay privileges were to be temporary in nature , and eventually abolished , citing the only reason for their existence as tradition and economic necessity as a form of affirmative action for the Malays . Despite this , those who challenge ketuanan Melayu or " Malay rights " were still often berated , especially by politicians from UMNO . Many UMNO politicians continued referring to non @-@ Malays as " orang pendatang " or " pendatang asing " ( foreign immigrants ) . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Before leaving office , Mahathir had condemned Malays who relied on their privileges . Abdullah continued this , warning Malays to learn to live without crutches or end up in wheelchairs . His administration began the practice of meritocracy , which Mahathir had tentatively proposed , and university admissions quotas were eliminated . However , some charged that this did not eliminate discrimination in education . The pre @-@ university stream was divided into two ; one course prepared students for the Sijil Tinggi <unk> Malaysia ( <unk> ) standardised examination , lasting two years , while the other comprised various matriculation courses graded by individual lecturers , typically lasting a year . 
 Critics dismissed meritocracy as a sham , arguing that it was unfair to consider the two streams equivalent for admissions purposes . Though ostensibly open to non @-@ Bumiputra , critics alleged that most who took matriculation were Malays . 
 Previously , the constitutionality of <unk> or Bumiputra @-@ only matriculation courses had been questioned , as the amended Article 153 prohibited refusal of admission to students on grounds of race alone . As a result , matriculation courses were opened to non @-@ Bumiputra . However , some in UMNO considered meritocracy too harsh on rural Malay students , disadvantaging them compared to their urban counterparts , and called for the restoration of quotas to avoid an " uneven playing field " . 
 At the 2004 UMNO General Assembly , Deputy Permanent Chairman <unk> <unk> waved a book on 13 May Incident , warning : " Fifty @-@ eight years ago we had an agreement with the other races , in which we permitted them to <unk> [ reside temporarily ] on this land . ... Let no one from the other races ever question the rights of Malays on this land . Don 't question the religion , because this is my right on this land . " Then Higher Education Minister <unk> Salleh also declared at the assembly that non @-@ Bumiputras would never be permitted to enter the Universiti Teknologi MARA ( UiTM ) , which is Bumiputra @-@ only : " I will not compromise on this matter . " 
 Then at the following year 's General Assembly , Education Minister and UMNO Youth head Hishammuddin Hussein — the son of Tun Hussein Onn — brandished the keris while calling for the restoration of the NEP as part of the National Development Policy ( NDP ) that Mahathir had initiated . According to Hishammuddin , the keris symbolised the role of UMNO Youth in championing the Malay race . Meanwhile , his deputy , Khairy Jamaluddin — Abdullah Badawi 's son @-@ in @-@ law — discussed the revival of the NEP in the form of a separate entity titled as the New National Agenda ( <unk> ) . Hishammuddin would later describe the keris as a " unifying symbol " , stating that " The young people today no longer see it as a symbol to uphold ketuanan Melayu . " 
 = = = " Racial politics " = = = 
 Chinese politicians within the government raised issues with the Constitution in late 2005 . Lim Keng <unk> of Gerakan asked for a re @-@ examination of the social contract to ascertain whether Bangsa Malaysia could be achieved . Lim was severely criticised by many prominent Malay politicians , including Khairy Jamaluddin and Ahmad Shabery Cheek . The Malay press , mostly owned by UMNO , also ran articles condemning the questioning of the social contract . Lim responded : " How do you expect non @-@ Malays to pour their hearts and souls into the country , and to one day die for it if you keep harping on this ? Flag @-@ waving and singing the ' Negaraku ' ( national anthem ) are rituals , while true love for the nation lies in the heart . " 
 A year earlier , Abdullah had mentioned the most " significant aspect " of the social contract as " the agreement by the indigenous peoples to grant citizenship to the immigrant Chinese and Indians " . Although Abdullah went on to state that the character of the nation changed to " one that Chinese and Indian citizens could also call their own , " the speech went largely unremarked . Finally , Lim stated that the Malay press had blown his comments out of proportion and misquoted him . The issue ended with UMNO Youth chief Hishammuddin Hussein warning people not to " bring up the issue again as it has been agreed upon , appreciated , understood and endorsed by the Constitution . " 
 In January 2006 , the government announced a Rukunegara awareness campaign . The government press agency , <unk> , quoted the Tunku as saying in 1986 that " The Malays are not only the natives but also the lords of this country and nobody can dispute this fact " . The articles of the Constitution touching on the official religion of Islam , the monarchy , the status of Malay as the national language , and Malay special rights were described as " clearly spell [ ing ] out the acknowledgment and recognition that the Malays are the indigenous ' pribumi ' [ natives ] of this land . " It was then stated that the new emphasis on the Rukunegara was to prevent further questioning of the social contract , which " decides on the political polarity and socio @-@ economic standing of Malaysians " . 
 Later , a survey of Malaysians found that 55 % of respondents agreed politicians should be " blamed for segregating the people by playing racial politics " . <unk> Mahathir — Mahathir 's son and an UMNO Youth leader — defended UMNO 's actions because of economic disparities , insisting that " As long as that remains , there will always be people to champion each race to equalise things . " <unk> Abdul Samad , the chairman of the BN <unk> ' Club , argued that politicians were simply responding to " a country ... divided into different races , " asking , " if you talk about Malay issues to the Malay community , is that playing racial politics ? " M. <unk> , the President of the PPP , disagreed : " Every 12 months , the parties go back to one race championing their own causes and , at the end of the day , when the general election comes , we talk about ' Bangsa Malaysia ' . " 
 Reflecting the mutual climate of distrust and racialist policies in both Singapore and Malaysia ( in Singapore , the policies allegedly being pro @-@ Chinese ) , Lee Kuan Yew sparked another debate in September on the role of Malay primacy in Malaysian politics , stating that the Chinese had been " systematically marginalised " in both Malaysia and Indonesia . The resulting diplomatic incident , with ensuing denials of marginalisation from Malaysian government politicians , led to Lee issuing an apology for his remarks which also attempted to justify them . Abdullah indicated he was not satisfied with what he referred to as a " qualified apology " , but the Malaysian government accepted it nevertheless . 
 The following month , a controversy arose after the Asian Strategic and Leadership Institute ( <unk> ) issued a report calculating Bumiputra @-@ held equity at 45 % — a stark difference from the official figure of 18 @.@ 9 % , used by politicians to justify the retention or revival of the NEP . One local analyst suggested that " If Bumiputra equity is 45 per cent , then surely the next question is , why the need for Bumiputera rights ? It has implications for government policy and it ( removing indigenous rights ) is one thing UMNO will never accept at present . " The report 's methodology was criticised for using market value instead of par value for its calculations of equity , and limiting its scope to a thousand publicly listed companies . It also included government @-@ linked companies ( <unk> ) as Bumiputra @-@ owned companies . Some , however , criticised the government , alleging that par value did not accurately reflect the value of the enterprises studied , and claimed that a portion of GLC equity should be considered Bumiputra @-@ held . The report was later withdrawn , but the controversy continued after an independent media outlet cited a study following the government methodology that indicated Bumiputra equity had passed the 30 % mark in 1997 . 
 At the Johor UMNO convention that same month , Johor Menteri Besar ( Chief Minister ) , Abdul Ghani Othman , criticised the Bangsa Malaysia and " meritocracy " policies . Ghani described Bangsa Malaysia as a threat to the Malays and their Constitutional position , suggesting it could " threaten national stability " as well . Ghani insisted that the policy " be applied in the context ... with the Malays as the pivotal race " , and described meritocracy as a " form of discrimination and oppression " because rural Malay students could not compete with their urban counterparts . In the resulting controversy about his remarks , several federal ministers criticised Ghani , with one saying that Bangsa Malaysia " has nothing to do with one race given a pivotal role over others " , and another arguing that " It does not impinge on the rights of <unk> or other communities . " Ghani stood by his comments , declaring that the proponents of Bangsa Malaysia were also advocating a " Malaysian Malaysia " , as Lee Kuan Yew had , even though " the government has rejected it from the start . " Najib , the Deputy Prime Minister , suggested that any effort to define Bangsa Malaysia politically would be fruitless , and as such the debate was unnecessary ; he also insisted that " It does not question the special rights of the Malays , our quota or anything of that sort . " The UMNO Annual General Assembly that year was the first to be televised in full ; it became a subject of controversy when delegates such as Hashim <unk> made speeches utilising heavy racial rhetoric ; Hishammuddin , who had brandished the kris again , was asked by Hashim when he would " use it " . After the assembly , Hishammuddin insisted that the kris was not a symbol of Malay supremacy . 
 In October 2007 , Lee provoked more debate after suggesting that " If they ( Malaysia ) would just educate the Chinese and Indians , use them and treat them as their citizens , they can equal us ( Singapore ) and even do better than us and we would be happy to rejoin them . " UMNO Information Chief Muhammad Muhammad Taib responded , telling the press that Malaysia implemented policies to assist economically disadvantaged Malays , instead of neglecting them as Singapore did , stating also that at one point the Malays would have to compete on a level playing field with other Malaysians .

 In the 2008 general election , BN was returned to power for the first time without its customary 2 / 3 supermajority in the Dewan Rakyat , meaning it could no longer pass constitutional amendments without the support of opposition parties . The election results were widely seen as reflecting discontent about the state of the country 's economy and increasing ethnic tensions within the country ; the three main opposition parties had campaigned on a platform condemning the NEP and the government 's response to widening economic disparities . The month after , the Crown Prince of Kelantan Tengku Faris Petra said during an assembly organised by the newly formed Malay Unity Action Front that since the Malays had given in to granting the non @-@ Malays citizenship , the latter should not seek equality or special treatment . In his speech , the prince also called for Malay unity to ensure that Malay sovereignty and supremacy was preserved . 
 Anwar Ibrahim , former UMNO deputy President and former Deputy Prime Minister , whose Parti Keadilan Rakyat became the second @-@ largest party in Parliament after the elections , and the de facto leader of the opposition Pakatan Rakyat coalition , chose to instead reject ketuanan Melayu in favour of " ketuanan rakyat " ( people 's supremacy ) . Celebrating the end of his five @-@ year ban from political activity on 15 April 2008 , he told reporters : " We are here to counter the massive propaganda campaign by <unk> leaders , who are talking on Malay supremacy . And giving clear definitive answer in reply of this , to say that what we want , what we desire for is a new Malaysia , is supremacy for all Malaysians . " A week later , his wife Wan <unk> Wan Ismail , president of PKR , told the press that " we should not keep talking about Malay supremacy or marginalising a certain race , which is not what the people want to see , " urging instead the adoption of ketuanan rakyat . 
 Not long thereafter , Hishammuddin himself apologised for his brandishing of the keris at the three previous UMNO annual general assemblies , saying he was sorry " if it had affected the non @-@ Malays " . He refused to comment on whether he would repeat the act in the future . His conditional apology was met with heavy criticism from within UMNO ; one media outlet described the reaction as such : " The sentiment among many in the party is that the Chinese and Indians betrayed the BN when they voted for Pakatan Rakyat . There is hurt . There is anger . So why should Hishammuddin be too concerned about what non @-@ Malays think of the keris act ? " Many felt that the apology itself threatened Malay supremacy . Abdullah welcomed the apology , saying it was brave and " made it clear to the non @-@ Malays the important role the keris had in the Malay community " . In response to questions about the diminishing of Malay supremacy post @-@ elections , he said that it was more about parity for the Bumiputra communities , rejecting the notion of political dominance : 
 So when we talk about ( Malay supremacy ) , we mean we must be successful in many fields . It is never about ruling over others , or forcing our power upon them ... We are not going to be a race that dominates others . We want to be a party that represents the Malays and that is ready to co @-@ operate for the future of Malays and the people , as Malays will also succeed when all Malaysians are successful . ... That is Malay supremacy and I hope people will understand it . 
 Shortly thereafter , Information Minister Ahmad Shabery Cheek insisted that ketuanan Melayu did not imply a master @-@ slave relationship in any sense between the Malays and non @-@ Malays . Instead , he suggested , it referred to the institution of the Malay monarchs , who had once been the " masters " , but gave up their primacy when the Federal Constitution was adopted at independence . Shabery cited Article 182 of the Constitution , which grants the royalty certain legal immunities , as an example of Malay supremacy . However , some prominent members of the royalty such as the Raja of Perlis and former Yang di @-@ Pertuan Agong Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Putra Syed <unk> have themselves been critical of ketuanan Melayu ; in early 2009 , the Raja stated that " In Malaysia , every race is <unk> [ master ] ... I believe that if everyone understands that every individual of any race , should not be deprived of their rights , then the efforts of certain parties who think that the supremacy or rights should only be given to a particular race can be stopped . " 
 In late 2009 , the Cabinet decided to change the curriculum of <unk> Tata Negara ( National Civics Bureau , or BTN ) programmes , which are mandatory for public servants and students studying on public funds . Many , especially politicians from Pakatan Rakyat , had previously criticised BTN programmes as propaganda for ketuanan Melayu ; citing this , the Selangor state government banned its civil servants and students from attending BTN courses . Some Ministers and former Prime Minister Mahathir defended BTN as necessary to imbue participants with the values of discipline and honesty , denying they had anything to do with ketuanan Melayu . Minister in the Prime Minister 's Department <unk> Aziz insisted the Cabinet was right to demand a change in BTN , calling Mahathir a racist and saying : 
 They all know what the syllabus is all about so who are we to say that it did not happen ? You want to lie ? You make people laugh . I mean there are people who attended the courses who came out very angry . There were many instances of the use of words like ketuanan Melayu . It is ridiculous ...

 " The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter " is the seventh episode of the first season of the American fairy tale / drama television series Once Upon a Time , and the seventh overall . The episode was co @-@ written by series creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis , while being directed by David M. Barrett . Horowitz and Kitsis had intended to kill off Graham since the pilot episode was picked up , believing that it would add " stakes " to the series and show viewers that the story is " not in Henry 's head . " The episode is considered significant , as Graham 's death reveals that Regina is aware of her fairytale past . 
 The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke , Maine , in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the " real world " town by a powerful curse . This episode 's story follows Sheriff Graham ( Jamie Dornan ) as he remembers his fairytale counterpart , leading to significant consequences that parallel his previous life as the Huntsman . It first aired in the United States on ABC on December 11 , 2011 . An estimated 8 @.@ 91 million viewers watched the episode , placing third in its timeslot behind NBC and CBS . The episode received mixed reviews from television critics , as some praised Dornan 's character but were divided on the ending sequence . It was the series ' mid @-@ season finale .

He kisses Emma and suddenly sees a vision of a wolf , only to have Emma push him away . Frustrated by Emma 's lack of understanding , Graham later sleeps with Regina . During the night , he awakens abruptly from a dream of a deer and a wolf . When Graham tells Regina that the dream felt like a memory , Regina tries to convince him to stay , but Graham leaves . As Graham attempts to get to his car , the wolf from his visions appears next to him , startling him before it leaves . As he tries to find the wolf in the woods , he runs into Mr. Gold ( Robert Carlyle ) . Graham tells him about the wolf , and Mr. Gold suggests to him that dreams are memories from another life . 
 The following morning , Emma discovers flowers on the table and throws them out , assuming they are from Graham , but Mary Margaret ( Ginnifer Goodwin ) says that they were hers from Dr. Whale ( David Anders ) , with whom she had a one @-@ night stand . Emma is glad to hear that Mary Margaret appears to be getting over David ( Josh Dallas ) . Mary Margaret tells Emma that it is obvious that she has feelings for Graham , but does not acknowledge them because she is putting up a " wall " to keep herself from getting hurt . 
 The sheriff finds the wolf in the woods , and when he whistles , the wolf goes to him . As he pets the wolf 's head , he sees himself holding a knife , about to hurt the woman he only knows as Mary Margaret . Graham pays a visit to her classroom , telling her that he believes they know each other from another life , before Storybrooke . Mary Margaret assumes that the sheriff has been talking to Henry , and while this is not the case , this gives Graham the idea to consult Henry about his book . Meanwhile , at the sheriff 's office , Regina shows up and warns Emma to stay away from Graham , apparently jealous of his connection with Emma . 
 Graham visits Henry ( Jared S. Gilmore ) and describes his visions to Henry , to which Henry replies that he must be the queen 's Huntsman . The Huntsman was hired by the Evil Queen to remove Snow White 's heart and bring it back to her , but when he does not do so , she removes his heart . Graham later attempts to explain to Emma that he could not feel anything with Regina because he does not have a heart . Graham and Emma then encounter the wolf from Graham 's visions , and follow it to a graveyard and vault marked with a symbol Graham saw in his visions and in Henry 's book . Looking for his heart , Graham fervently searches the vault , which turns out to be the tomb of Henry Mills . Regina arrives to place flowers on her father 's grave and is furious to find them there . 
 Regina accuses Emma of stealing the sheriff from her , and Emma responds that Regina has chased everyone away . Graham defends Emma , and the women exchange blows . Later , while Graham cleans Emma 's wounds , Regina pushes aside the stone inside the vault , which turns out not to be a tomb after all ; the stone reveals a staircase . Emma realizes her feelings for Graham and the two kiss just as Regina opens a storage box in the hidden room and clutches Graham 's heart , crushing it to dust , showing that she remembers being the Evil Queen . Before he collapses and dies , Graham 's last words to Emma are " I remember ! Thank you . "

 In the Enchanted Forest , the Evil Queen mourns the death of her husband , Snow White 's father , although she herself is responsible for his death . Snow ( Goodwin ) and the Queen seemingly comfort each other over the loss . The Queen consults her magic mirror ( Esposito ) to ask how she can kill Snow , who is beloved by the people but a threat to her bid for the throne . She says that the king 's knights will not kill his daughter , and the mirror tells her that she needs a huntsman . As Graham saw in his flashbacks , the Huntsman ( Dornan ) and his brother wolf seem to enjoy living a peaceful life in the woods . The Huntsman kills only for himself to live , and has no compassion for humans , who do not understand the wild . As the Huntsman and his wolf enter a tavern , the other patrons begin harassing him , prompting him to successfully defend himself . His performance is viewed in the magic mirror by the Queen , who is greatly impressed . She summons the Huntsman to offer him anything he wants on the condition that he brings her Snow 's heart . He agrees to this deal , in return asking for the protection of all the wolves in the Enchanted Forest . 
 Snow and the Huntsman walk together in the forest , and she sees through his disguise and correctly guesses that he was sent by the Queen to kill her . Snow flees , but as the Huntsman catches up with her , he finds her writing a letter , which she requests he deliver to the queen after she is killed . The Huntsman takes out his knife , but instead of killing her , he fashions a whistle out of a bamboo stick , telling her that it will summon help and then telling her to run . The Huntsman then returns to the queen with a deer heart , hoping that she will not know the difference . The queen asks him to read her the letter , which is an apology for past wrongs as well as a request from Snow that her stepmother rule the kingdom with compassion . The queen burns the letter and takes the box with the heart in it to store in her vault . When she cannot open one of her storage safes , it proves that the Huntsman lied to her ; the heart is not human . The Queen has her guards drag him down to the vault and she yanks his glowing heart out of his body . She tells the Huntsman that from now on he will be her pet and will do her bidding forever , and if he ever betrays her , all she has to do is squeeze .

 The episode was co @-@ written by co @-@ creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz , and was directed by The Mentalist veteran David M. Barrett . Guest actor Giancarlo Esposito made his second appearance in the series as Magic Mirror / Sidney Glass . Meghan Ory returned as Ruby / Red Riding Hood , while Scott Heindl made his only appearance for the series as Bartholomew . Leading up to the episode broadcast , Kitsis and Horowitz noted that " The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter " would feature consequences of events that occurred in the previous episode . Horowitz explained , " Emma is in a raw emotional place , trying to come to terms with her feelings about what she discovered about Graham . Graham is also in a very raw emotional place because he 's clearly conflicted and it 's this cauldron of emotions that leads to the kiss . " Kitsis added that , " We 're really excited that the kiss that you 've seen is really just the jumping off point of the story we 're telling . It 's not like it ends with the kiss , it starts with that and it takes us somewhere that we 're excited to show you . " 
 In the episode , the character of Sheriff Graham was killed off , something that actor Jamie Dornan had known would happen since ABC picked up the pilot . It was the first major death of the series . In an interview with E ! reporter Kristin Dos Santos , Dornan hinted that while his counterpart in Storybrooke has died , the huntsman could return at some point , as Dornan is still a regular on the series . As much of the episode involves Graham discovering his fairytale past , the writers designed the episode to mislead viewers by having them invest in the character . Kitsis and Horowitz commented that while the death made them " sad , " the battle between Emma and Regina requires " stakes and unfortunately , sometimes stakes are people 's lives . " They also decided to kill the character relatively early in the series in order to show viewers that " it 's real . It 's not in Henry 's head . " Kitsis continued , " It ’ s interesting , but part of the intent was to make you love him and we loved him very much . And the fact that the audience seems to have loved him means a lot to us , in that we feel like we succeeded on that front . If you don ’ t feel sad , then it was a failure of the execution of the story . " 
 Actress Lana Parrilla believed that Graham helped fill a void for her character , commenting that his loss " was not easy for [ Regina ] . That ’ s why , when she crushes his heart , there ’ s a tear coming out of her eye . She didn ’ t want to do it , but she had no choice — almost like how she had no choice to kill her father . I ’ m not saying I agree with it , but for the character , it ’ s what she had to do . " Parrilla also cited " The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter " as the first episode where viewers see " how the two worlds collided , " a reference to Regina 's ability to kill Graham by squeezing the heart of his fairytale counterpart . The revelation of the vault , Kitsis and Horowitz explained , " is a very important thing for us in terms of moving forward in the season in that we wanted to send a very clear message that Regina knows what ’ s going on and has some very clear intentions in Storybrooke . " The episode was included in Reawakened : A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013 .

She concluded , " Episodes like this give me strong hope for the second part of this season , one @-@ nighters and all . Bring on the pain , boys . " She graded the episode with an A. 
 Blast Magazine columnist Christopher Peck was disappointed that the writers had not yet revealed the reason for the Evil Queen 's grudge , commenting , " If the thing that sticks out most about an episode of television is what I didn ’ t get out , that ’ s an ominous sign : a foreshadowing that the show has no goddamn clue where it ’ s headed . " He did however enjoy seeing Graham 's memories , calling them and the other series flashbacks " the freshest and most thrilling part of the show . " While describing Graham 's death as " heartbreaking , " Peck felt that it " completely nullifies any advancement the episode made . " He graded the episode with a C + . 
 Entertainment Weekly 's Shaunna Murphy was a little more critical of the episode , though she did call it " game @-@ changing . " Noting that it " felt rushed , " she " would have preferred a slow @-@ burning mystery spread out over several episodes over this dramatic , Nikki and Paulo @-@ style stand @-@ alone sendoff . " Murphy however concluded that Graham 's death was " one of the coolest sequences we 've seen so far on this show . " The A.V.

He also noted negative similarities to the television series Lost , explaining , " Remember when Jack , Sawyer , and Kate were stuck in the polar @-@ bear cages , and the plot just wandered in an aimless haze ? The time when a bunch of viewers started jumping off because the writers kept adding questions without ever giving answers ? What took Lost 44 episodes , <unk> has done in seven . " Unlike other reviewers , Sava called the ending a " frustrating conclusion , " and believed that " Horowitz and Kitsis [ took ] one step forward and two steps back with this development . "

The song was recorded at <unk> Hall Studios , Century City , California , and Loft Recording Studios , Bronxville , New York . " SOS " contains a sample of " Tainted Love " , written by Ed Cobb in 1965 , and popularized by English synthpop duo Soft Cell in 1981 . In an interview with HitQuarters , Rotem explained the song 's conception , saying " I heard ' Tainted Love ' and wanted to take the bass line and update it with a new swing . When I gave the track to Evan [ Bogart ] , the 80s feeling was already in the track . " Rotem was asked how he felt about working with singers who became successful international recording artists after he had worked with them in an interview with William E. Ketchum for HipHopDX in May 2011 , and referred to Rihanna and writing " SOS " in his response , saying : 
 I did [ Rihanna ] ' s song “ [ SOS ] , ” and it wasn 't her first song , but it was her first number one . Since then , she 's obviously one of the biggest stars in the world . But I never look at it like that 's because of me or something like that . I just look at it like it was amazing to have worked with her at that time , and I would like to work with her again . 
 Originally , " SOS " was intended to be given to and recorded by former Def Jam Recordings label mate Christina Milian , for her third studio album , So Amazin ' ( 2006 ) , but Milian turned down the song and former Def Jam CEO and chairman L.A.

 = = Production and mixing = = 
 The background vocals in the song were compressed using a compressor program called Waves Renaissance Compressor , which was used in order to create an enhanced polished effect . In an interview with Sound on Sound , mixing engineer Phil Tan , who carried out the audio mixing on " SOS " , explained that he compressed the background vocals because " SOS " is a " high energy track " , and he wanted the vocals to complement it . Tan also noted that the background vocals were pitch shifted to increase tonal quality and create an enhanced effect during the chorus . The pitch shifting consisted of making the left vocals flat and the right vocals sharp , with varying degrees of delay , and later mixing them together . When asked about the production of the lead vocals , Tan described the song as " a pounding type of song , and the lyrics are a cry for help , so the vocals need to be ' in your face ' , almost aggressive , " and said that he wanted the vocals to remain constant . As with the background vocals , the lead vocals were compressed using the Waves Renaissance Compressor . Tan continued to note that the lack of reverb included on " SOS " was largely due to the fact that being an uptempo song , there was not a lot of room left to add anything else . Tan explained the production process of sampling " Tainted Love " , as well as the changes which were made : 
 This song uses a stereo two @-@ bar loop from Soft Cell 's song ' Tainted Love ' as its basis . JR played the additional parts with a combination of soft and hardware synths . There were probably 30 to 40 tracks in total . JR tends to give you [ Pro Tools ] Sessions that have a clear direction : there 's not much guesswork . I didn 't change or add much , just a bass drum and taking out the loop a couple of times for additional breaks . There was never any doubt that it was going to be a clubby song , so it had to be very immediate and hard @-@ hitting .

The song 's instrumental composition is built around a prominent sample of " Tainted Love " , which was originally written by Ed Cobb in 1965 and popularised by English synthpop duo Soft Cell , when they released their cover version in 1981 . 
 The use of the ' Tainted Love ' sample was well received by critics . Ruth Jamieson of The Observer commented that the sample was an " outrageously hooky Soft Cell rhythm " . <unk> Bass of Contactmusic.com complimented the inclusion of the " Tainted Love " sample , describing " SOS " as " superbly infectious " . Bass continued to praise the song for not making the sample too obvious , writing " I was accepting it to sound like every other song that has sampled the hook .

 = Batman : Arkham Knight = 
 Batman : Arkham Knight is a 2015 action @-@ adventure video game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , and Microsoft Windows . Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman , it is the successor to the 2013 video game Batman : Arkham Origins , and the fourth main installment in the Batman : Arkham series . Arkham Knight was released worldwide on June 23 , 2015 . 
 Written by Sefton Hill , Ian Ball and Martin Lancaster , Arkham Knight is based on the franchise 's long @-@ running comic book mythos . Set one year after the events of 2011 's Batman : Arkham City , the game 's main storyline follows Batman as he confronts Scarecrow , who has launched an attack on Gotham City , causing a city @-@ wide evacuation . Scarecrow , with the help of the mysterious Arkham Knight , is also able to unite Batman 's greatest foes in an attempt to finally destroy Batman . 
 The game is presented from a third @-@ person perspective , with a primary focus on Batman 's melee combat , stealth abilities , detective skills , and gadgets . Arkham Knight also introduces the Batmobile as a playable vehicle , which is used for transportation , puzzle solving and combat . The game expands Batman 's arsenal of gadgets and combat attacks and offers a more open world structure , allowing the player to complete side missions away from the primary storyline . 
 The console versions of Arkham Knight received positive reviews , particularly for its narrative , visuals , gameplay , combat , and world designs , with most criticism given to the emphasis on the Batmobile . The Windows version , however , became the subject of intense criticism due to major performance issues , even on high @-@ end graphics hardware , prompting Warner Bros. to temporarily withdraw that version of the game from sale . Upon its release , the game was the fastest selling game of 2015 , and the fastest selling game in the Arkham series , reaching over 5 million units sold globally by October 2015 . Rocksteady released additional content for the game , including story @-@ driven missions , challenge maps , and skins for Batman and his allies , as well as new Batmobiles from Batman 's history and custom racetracks for them . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Batman : Arkham Knight is set within Gotham City , which is open to the player from the beginning of the game , allowing them to travel freely anywhere within its boundaries without any loading transitions . Many of the gadgets and the gameplay elements from the previous Arkham games return , including the grapnel gun , line launcher , batarangs , the countering system , Detective Vision and the Remote Hacking Device . The Disruptor receives upgrades from previous games , becoming a rifle that can be used to disable or detonate enemy weapons and drone turrets , booby @-@ trap weapon crates to shock enemies who attempt to arm themselves , and tag vehicles for Batman to track . The remote controlled batarang is similarly upgraded to include a scanner that can be thrown out to gain information on the surrounding area . New gadgets include the Voice <unk> , which can be used to imitate other characters ' voices such as Harley Quinn and the Arkham Knight to direct thugs into traps . 
 The player can fly Batman throughout the city using his cape , with gliding now allowing for faster , longer sustained flights , steeper dives , and higher climbs . Batman can use some gadgets while gliding , such as batarangs or the line @-@ launcher . The grapnel gun can now be used to instantly switch directions during a glide , as well as being fired twice while in the air to chain grappling moves together . 
 The game 's ' <unk> ' combat system allows for basic attacks including strikes , counters , and dodging which can be combined to keep Batman attacking while moving between enemies and avoiding being attacked himself . Basic enemies include enemies armed with shields and shock batons , while others are armed with guns which significantly damage Batman . These enemies can perform a charge and tackle attack only used by larger enemies in previous games ; precision timed dodging , and a batarang can instantly defeat some charging enemies . The system adds the ability to combine attacks on prone enemies without interrupting a combo streak . Batman can counter enemy attacks and throw them into other enemies for increased damage . Batman is also capable of disarming enemies wielding items like baseball bats and using the acquired weapon on several foes before it breaks . Arkham Knight introduces " Dual Play " , in which players can seamlessly switch control of Batman to one of his allies : Robin , Nightwing or Catwoman while in <unk> Combat , which the player enters when they have accumulated an uninterrupted combat streak . Each successful , uninterrupted attack adds to the player 's combat score , which carries over between each controlled character and unlocks double @-@ team takedowns on opponents at higher scores . 
 Arkham Knight introduces enemy medics who can shield enemies in electrified fields and revive unconscious ones , sword @-@ wielding enemies , and brutes who are resistant to damage and must be stunned before they can be attacked ; brutes wielding Gatling guns , tasers , and blades require additional steps to defeat . Enemies are capable of employing tactics to counter Batman 's various skills , including deploying landmines , controlling hovering drones , disabling vents if Batman is found using them , and detecting his location if Batman uses Detective Vision for too long . 
 Throughout the city , Batman encounters enemy watchtowers , guard posts , aerial drones , and explosive mines embedded in the city streets . Some drones can be hacked and turned against their allies by using the Remote Hacking Device . Arkham Knight introduces the " Fear Takedown " , where Batman can subdue up to five enemies simultaneously as long as he remains undetected ; time is slowed after each takedown , allowing the player to target the next enemy . Hazardous items such as power generators can be used in combat for environmental attacks . Combat is rewarded with experience points , which are used to unlock gadget abilities , combat moves , and health upgrades . Batman can now access grates from afar , allowing him to roll forward and immediately get under the grate if in range instead of having to be right on top of them , while also initiating multiple takedowns from within them . Some enemies carry devices capable of blocking Batman 's Detective Vision . 
 Arkham Knight features side missions , known as " Most Wanted " missions , which can be attempted at any time and feature prominent characters from the Batman universe . One such character , the Riddler , provides 243 optional " Riddler challenges " to solve . These challenges consist of collecting trophies hidden throughout the city , through the use of gadgets or Batman 's car , the Batmobile , to disable traps and barriers , and completing timed races . The player can mark Riddler trophies on the in @-@ game map once found if they do not initially have the necessary equipment to complete the puzzle , and learn of additional locations for collectables by interrogating the Riddler 's henchmen . 
 Batman can investigate crimes such as murders , using his Detective Vision to reconstruct the crimes to locate clues and identify the perpetrators , or use his Tissue Scanner to investigate a victim 's skin , muscle , and bones for clues . Completing the story mode unlocks a New Game Plus mode , enabling the player to replay the game with all of the gadgets , experience , abilities , and Riddler collectables that they have obtained . The completion of some tasks is reflected in the Gotham City Police Department , with thugs and supervillains becoming incarcerated , and criminal memorabilia from missions and previous games being collected in the evidence room . 
 = = = Batmobile = = = 
 The game introduces the Batmobile as a drivable vehicle . The bulletproof Batmobile can be summoned to the player 's location while on foot or , if the player is airborne , summoned to meet Batman as he lands . The vehicle features the ability to perform jumps , speed boosts , rotate on the spot , smash through objects like barricades and trees , and fire missiles that can immobilize enemy vehicles . Batman can eject from the Batmobile and immediately begin gliding around Gotham City . 
 Most enemies will run away at the sight of the vehicle , eliminating the need for Batman to fight them , and enemies attacking the car can be subdued by its automated taser defenses . Like Batman , the Batmobile can be upgraded with new abilities . Riddler challenges also feature objectives requiring the Batmobile , such as timed races in tunnels beneath Gotham City , where the environmental obstacles change during each lap , and invisible question marks that must be revealed using the Batmobile 's scanner . 
 The Batmobile has two modes , which can be switched at any time : Pursuit and Battle . Pursuit is for moving from area to area and completing specific driving challenges . In Battle mode , the Batmobile becomes more tank than car , allowing a full 360 @-@ degree range of movement , including strafing in any direction , while revealing the multiple weapon systems on board , including a Vulcan chain gun for quick damage , a 60mm hypervelocity cannon for fire support , anti @-@ tank guided missiles for wide @-@ ranging damage against multiple targets , and a non @-@ lethal riot suppressor . 
 Additional upgrades to the vehicle include an EMP device , which releases an electric pulse used to temporarily stun enemy drones ; and the " drone virus " , which allows the player to override the weapon systems of enemy vehicles and cause them to attack each other . The Batmobile can also be controlled remotely , driven in indoor locations , and used in solving the game 's puzzles , such as lowering an inaccessible elevator with its attached winch or obtaining a Riddler trophy . The Batwing is used in conjunction with the Batmobile to deliver upgrades .

 Arkham Knight features a large ensemble cast of characters from the history of Batman comics . The main character is Batman ( Kevin Conroy ) — a superhero trained to the peak of human physical and mental perfection and an expert in martial arts . He is supported by his allies , Robin ( Matthew Mercer ) , Nightwing ( Scott Porter ) , Catwoman ( Grey DeLisle ) , Barbara Gordon ( Ashley Greene ) — who assists Batman covertly as the hacker Oracle , and her father police commissioner James Gordon ( Jonathan Banks ) . Batman 's loyal butler Alfred Pennyworth and Wayne Enterprises colleague Lucius Fox ( Dave Fennoy ) provide Batman with tactical support , and the holy warrior Azrael ( Khary Payton ) aims to replace Batman as Gotham 's protector . 
 Throughout the city , Batman is faced with several supervillains : he must overcome Scarecrow 's ( John Noble ) plot to threaten Gotham City , dismantle the Penguin 's ( Nolan North ) weapon dealing operation , put an end to Two @-@ Face 's ( Troy Baker ) bank heists , conquer the Riddler 's ( Wally Wingert ) challenges , capture the plant @-@ controlling Poison Ivy ( Tasia Valenza ) , and subdue Harley Quinn ( Tara Strong ) , who wants revenge against Batman for the death of the Joker ( Mark Hamill ) , Batman 's psychopathic nemesis . 
 The game introduces the villain Arkham Knight ( also voiced by Baker ) , a character created specifically for the game by Rocksteady , DC Comics CCO and comic @-@ book writer Geoff Johns , and DC co @-@ publisher and comic artist Jim Lee . The Arkham Knight is a militarized version of Batman , with the " A " logo of the Arkham Asylum facility worn as an emblem on his chest . Other villains include the pyromaniac Firefly , the beastly Man @-@ Bat ( Loren Lester ) , the assassin mercenary Deathstroke , the serial killer Professor Pyg , the religious fanatic Deacon <unk> , and Hush , who is impersonating Batman 's alter @-@ ego as Bruce Wayne . 
 Arkham Knight also features appearances by various characters drawn from the history of Batman comics and the previous Arkham games , including : pharmaceutical businessman Simon Stagg , reporters Vicki Vale and Jack Ryder , police officer Aaron Cash , corporate businessman Lex Luthor , crimefighter Kate Kane , serial killer Calendar Man , and mutated gangster Killer Croc , while the game 's downloadable content features appearances by Black Mask , Starro , Mad Hatter , Mr. Freeze , Ra 's al Ghul , Nyssa <unk> , and Nora Fries .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 One year after the death of the Joker during the events of Arkham City , Batman is struggling to come to terms with the absence of his nemesis and the uncomfortable feeling that the pair shared a bond deeper than either could admit . Without the Joker 's chaotic presence , Gotham 's citizens have never felt safer , and crime in the city has dramatically declined . However , this gives Batman 's enemies , including Penguin , Two @-@ Face , and Harley Quinn , a chance to unite with the singular goal of killing Batman . 
 On Halloween night , Scarecrow threatens the city with his newly created strain of fear toxin and bombs planted throughout Gotham , forcing the evacuation of the city 's six million civilians . Only criminals remain in the city , leaving Commissioner Gordon and the Gotham City Police Department outnumbered . Anticipating a new threat , Batman continues to develop crime @-@ fighting technology and maintains a vigil over the city . 
 Arkham Knight 's Gotham City is approximately five times the scale of the open @-@ air Arkham City prison in Arkham City . The game takes place in the center of the city , which is split into three islands : <unk> , Founders , and <unk> , with various districts such as the neon @-@ tinged Chinatown , and the industrial shipping yard . <unk> Island features shorter buildings , disheveled areas , and abandoned docks , while Founders Island is a modern development of skyscrapers built on the ruins of Gotham slums , and <unk> Island is an older metropolis with Wayne Tower at its center . Oracle has set up her communications headquarters in the Gotham clock tower , which also houses a makeshift Batcave . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 On Halloween , Scarecrow forces the civilian evacuation of Gotham City after threatening to unleash his potent new fear toxin . Batman tracks Scarecrow to a hideout where he rescues the imprisoned Poison Ivy , who had refused to join Batman 's other rogues in Scarecrow 's plot . Batman meets with Oracle , who identifies Ace Chemicals as the source of Scarecrow 's toxin . Batman investigates the facility but encounters the Arkham Knight and his heavily @-@ armed militia . Batman overcomes the forces and locates Scarecrow , who has transformed the entire building into a toxin bomb . Scarecrow reveals that he has kidnapped Oracle , and exposes Batman to the toxin before escaping . Batman inhibits the bomb 's blast radius before he is confronted by the Joker . 
 A flashback reveals that before the Joker died , his infected blood was used in blood transfusions , infecting five people including Batman ; Batman , concealing his infection from others , imprisoned the four other recipients who were physically and mentally transforming into the Joker . The Joker , now existing as a mental projection produced by the infected blood and fear toxin , frequently appears to taunt Batman , and manipulate his perception of the world around him . After Batman escapes the exploding Ace Chemicals , he alerts Gordon to Oracle 's kidnapping , who angrily leaves to find Scarecrow . 
 Batman learns that Scarecrow recruited businessman Simon Stagg to build the " Cloudburst " — a mass dispersal device for the fear toxin . Batman interrogates Stagg and then confronts Scarecrow aboard Stagg 's airship , and a dose of fear toxin allows the Joker to temporarily assume control of Batman 's body while the Arkham Knight extracts the Cloudburst . Recovering , Batman locates Oracle in Scarecrow 's hideout , but when he arrives she is exposed to the fear toxin , and commits suicide in terror . Harley Quinn seizes Batman 's base in the <unk> movie studio to rescue the Joker @-@ ized patients . Batman and Robin capture Harley and the infected , but one of the patients kills the others , before committing suicide , believing that Batman will become the perfect Joker . Realizing that Batman is infected , Robin attempts to imprison him before the Joker takes control , but is instead imprisoned by Batman , who refuses to stop until Scarecrow is caught . 
 The Arkham Knight activates the Cloudburst , flooding the city with fear toxin . Batman destroys the Cloudburst and convinces Ivy to empower an ancient tree that can neutralize the toxin ; she succeeds and saves Gotham , but the strain kills her , while Batman 's exposure to the toxin strengthens Joker 's control . Batman pursues the Arkham Knight to a construction site to rescue Gordon . The Knight reveals himself as Jason Todd , the previous Robin , who was seemingly murdered by the Joker , and has been left traumatized by torture at the Joker 's hands . Todd blames Batman for abandoning him , and although Batman offers to help Todd recover , he escapes . Batman and Gordon confront Scarecrow on the building 's roof , where Oracle is revealed to be alive , and her suicide the result of a hallucination . Batman rescues Oracle and returns her to the Gotham City Police Department ( GCPD ) , but Scarecrow escapes with Gordon . Using the remaining militia , Scarecrow assaults the GCPD to eliminate Batman 's allies . Batman and Oracle neutralize the militia , but Scarecrow uses the distraction to kidnap Robin . 
 To save Robin and Gordon , Batman surrenders to Scarecrow and is taken to the ruins of Arkham Asylum . Scarecrow reveals Batman 's secret identity to the world on television , before repeatedly injecting Batman with the fear toxin to break him before the public . Batman and the Joker then battle for control inside Batman 's mind ; Joker attempts to weaken Batman by recounting the people who have suffered and died because of Batman 's crusade , but Batman triumphs and locks the pleading Joker away in his mind forever to be forgotten — the Joker 's only fear . Todd arrives and saves Batman , who subdues Scarecrow with his own fear toxin . 
 After Batman ensures that Gotham is safe , Gordon dispatches the police to reclaim the streets , and Batman activates the " Knightfall " protocol to protect his loved ones . Surrounded by reporters , Batman returns home to Wayne Manor where he is greeted by Alfred . As the pair enter the manor , it explodes , seemingly killing them both . Gordon , now Gotham 's mayor , prepares to attend Oracle and Robin 's wedding . Elsewhere , two criminals attack a family in an alley but are confronted by a nightmarish silhouette resembling Batman .

 In August 2012 , Paul Dini , writer of the first two games in the Arkham series , said he would not be involved in writing a sequel to Arkham City . He did not write that game 's story @-@ based " Harley Quinn 's Revenge " downloadable content , and said that Warner Bros. and Rocksteady suggested he accept other work if offered . Rocksteady opted to use its own team of writers , headed by game director Sefton Hill and designer Ian Ball , with script elements by Martin Lancaster ; Geoff Johns served as a consultant on the plot . 
 Arkham Knight was announced in March 2014 , following leaked marketing material at the end of February , with series creators Rocksteady Studios returning to develop the game , following the development of 2013 's Batman : Arkham Origins by WB Games Montréal . Arkham Knight is described as the concluding chapter of the Arkham series from Rocksteady ; they had a finale for the series in mind since the development of Arkham City . Kevin Conroy returns as the voice of Batman , having done so in Arkham Asylum and Arkham City , after stating at the 2013 Dallas Comic Con that he had been working on " the next Arkham " . This statement led to speculation that he would reprise his role as Batman in Arkham Origins , the only Arkham game known to be in development at the time , which was not the case . 
 Rocksteady decided early on in development to make Arkham Knight only for the then @-@ upcoming next @-@ generation of consoles , which was considered to allow them to focus on using the system resources to their fullest without reining in their ideas to accommodate the older generation systems . The game allows for up to five times the number of on @-@ screen enemies as were possible in Arkham City , and riots can feature up to fifty on @-@ screen enemies interacting with the environment to smash items , and spray graffiti . The technical changes also allowed for cutscenes to be rendered in real time in the game engine , where previous installments had used pre @-@ rendered videos to compensate . Describing the scale of difference between Arkham Knight and earlier games , lead character artist Albert Feliu said that a single character model in Arkham Knight could contain the same amount of polygons used to render the entirety of Arkham Asylum 's environment . Arkham Knight is the first in the series to use the Apex physics simulation engine to have items like cloth , such as Batman 's cape , react realistically to movement or wind . Warner Bros. supported Rocksteady 's concept for the game , but both parties felt that three years was too long to wait between games , so WB Games Montréal was tasked with creating the prequel , Arkham Origins , to fill the gap . 
 Unlike Arkham Origins , the game does not feature a multiplayer component . As Hill explained , the development team knew the single @-@ player game would take the team 's full effort , with their " focus on making the best single @-@ player experience we can . We [ did not ] feel that it [ needed ] a multiplayer element . Warner Bros. backed that up right at the start . " 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Batman 's Batmobile was an aspect of the character that Rocksteady had wanted to include in its other Arkham games , but were limited by technical constraints . The designers , who worked in conjunction with DC , chose to look at their earlier design from Arkham Asylum , instead of models from the history of Batman comics and media , and evolve that to meet the necessary gameplay requirements . The vehicle was designed to integrate with Batman 's on @-@ foot traversal without being a burden ; Hill stated , " We didn 't want it to be like , ' Okay , the Batmobile is so good I 'll just stay in that all the time . ' or ' Batman is so powerful gliding around I won 't be using the Batmobile . ' There 's a definite need to use both of those . " The world 's challenges were set out on the vertical and horizontal plane of the map to discourage players from using only one form of movement , with the Batmobile providing a faster method for moving large distances over gliding . Unlike Arkham Origins , Arkham Knight does not feature a fast travel system as the designers considered traversal to be part of the game , and allowing players to skip that would detract from the experience . Buildings hit by the vehicle suffer cosmetic damage without slowing the car , as it was considered that being impeded by a collision while turning a corner would diminish the power fantasy of driving the Batmobile . 
 During early development , Rocksteady placed a prototype Batmobile in the existing Arkham City map , and learned that the claustrophobic city designed for Batman to glide and grapple did not work well for driving a vehicle . Gotham City was thus redesigned with wider streets to allow space for the Batmobile and other street traffic to drive without colliding into walls , and buildings were made taller to accommodate the vehicle 's ejection ability . To redesign Gotham City , the designers attempted to build on the previous games ' gothic architecture while making a more believable and dense city . Alongside minor elements like neon lights , billboard advertising , and American @-@ style cars , the team developed ideas for shops that could be found in the city , while retaining a grimy , dystopian theme . Describing the design , Hego said : " every kind of element we 've added in there ... makes the entire experience feel a little out of time . You couldn 't pinpoint whether it 's twenty years ago , now or in ten years time . " The designers valued making an open world that was " rich , vibrant , dense ... and full of interesting things to do " over it just being large . 
 In writing for Batman , Hill considered that a fundamental aspect of the character was how he interacts with his villains , allies , and the city around him . Hill said : " You know , what does it mean to be Batman ? ... How does it affect Batman when things happen to him ? What is his psychological make up ? Those are the influences behind the game ... you actually delve into the psyche of what makes him what he is , which is where I think so much of the interest in Batman is . " Batman 's armor was redesigned to match that of the Batmobile to make them appear visually similar — featuring the same shapes and material textures — and appear functionally compatible with the high @-@ speed methods in which the character enters and exits the vehicle . The design also added armor over Batman 's shoulders , covering the previously exposed cape , to make it appear more feasible that it could hold Batman 's weight without failing during gliding . For other returning characters , art director David Hego said that the designs were conceived to keep them interesting after players had seen them several times before in previous games , while the game 's autumnal setting also necessitated a change in character clothing over the winter setting of Arkham City . The Penguin lost his long coat , and was made to look dirtier , his clothing showing signs of sweat and food stains , and his head was shaved . For Two @-@ Face , the designers felt the character did not require changing significantly , and instead emphasized existing character traits , particularly his disfigured flesh , using references of burnt flesh as inspiration . Similarly , they wanted to retain the typical Riddler characterizations like green shirts emblazoned with question marks , but instead had the character design evolve throughout the game , modifying his own costume in response to the events of the plot . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Nick Arundel returned to compose the music for the game , having worked on Arkham Asylum and Arkham City previously . Arundel is helped by composer David Buckley , replacing Ron Fish who had worked with Arundel on the previous games . Arundel stated , " One of the good things about doing a sequel , is you get the opportunity to redo [ things you wished you changed ] , to revisit things ... We have a set of material that we want to keep consistent , like the Batman theme ... We wanted to keep [ that ] theme and tailor it more to the story for this game . How can we get the Scarecrow element out of that one theme . " Arundel added that Buckley was willing to work within the music he had already created , as opposed to wanting to add his own personal touch to it . Buckley received Arundel 's work from Arkham Asylum to help create new variations on the chords and melody from the original theme . Volume 1 of the official soundtrack was released from WaterTower Music alongside the game on June 23 , 2015 .

 Batman : Arkham Knight was released on PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , and Microsoft Windows on June 23 , 2015 . The game was originally scheduled to be released on October 14 , 2014 , which in turn was delayed to June 2 , 2015 . On the first delay , Rocksteady marketing game manager Guy Perkins stated , " If we didn ’ t give the team more time to do it , then we would be releasing something that we weren ’ t happy with . We want to make sure we ’ re absolutely nailing it 100 % . " A quality assurance tester for the game added , " Getting [ the game ] to work on consoles was impossible for months . That ’ s part of why the game got delayed so many times , [ Rocksteady was ] totally unprepared for how hard it was on next @-@ gen consoles . " In the UK , the Microsoft Windows version is only available as a digital release . Additionally , an OS X and Linux version of the game developed by Feral Interactive was scheduled for release in early 2016 after originally being scheduled to release in late 2015 ; it was cancelled in February 2016 . Feral stated the original delay was to " ensure good performance and wide @-@ ranging support " for the two platforms . 
 Two Collector 's Edition editions were also announced : the Limited edition contains the game in a Steelbook case , an 80 @-@ page concept art book , an Arkham Knight issue # 0 comic book , alternate costumes for Batman , Robin and Nightwing based on DC Comics ' The New 52 , and a statue of Batman . The Batmobile edition contains the Limited edition items , but replaces the Batman statue with a transformable Batmobile statue . However , on June 17 , consumers who purchased the " Batmobile Collector 's Edition " were notified that the edition had been cancelled due to a quality issue with the Batmobile statue from designer Project Triforce . Consumers were able to receive a refund or have their purchase transferred to another collector 's edition . Two days later , it was revealed that the Limited edition was delayed for release in Europe until mid @-@ July 2015 due to a packaging quality issue . In addition , a Serious Edition Comic Bundle was released , exclusively on Amazon.com. The edition featured the game , the " First Appearance " skin ( based on Batman 's first appearance in Detective Comics # 27 ) , and a limited edition 25th anniversary version of Arkham Asylum : A Serious House on Serious Earth , the graphic novel for which the Batman : Arkham series is loosely based . A limited edition PlayStation 4 was also released , featuring a " Steel Gray " console and controller with a custom Batman faceplate . 
 In February 2015 , it was revealed that Arkham Knight had received a " Mature " rating from the ESRB , rather than the " Teen " ratings previous installments in the franchise held . Sefton Hill and the Rocksteady team were caught off guard by the rating ; Hill explained that they did not create the game with a specific rating in mind , but that " It 's unavoidable that some bad stuff is going to happen . But that doesn 't mean we changed our approach . We 're not including gratuitous blood or swearing . We want to deliver a true end with no compromises , and it takes us to some dark places . " Although he did not elaborate which content in particular triggered the " M " rating , Hill did note that a " ratings analysis " by Warner Bros. indicated that the content of certain " key " scenes in the game could affect its rating . The team decided to maintain the offending content so that it would not " jeopardize " their vision for the game and its thematics . In an in @-@ depth explanation of the game 's content , the ESRB revealed the existence of scenes where players can " shoot unarmed characters and a hostage " , and torture scenes taking place on a " bloody operating table " as well as using a vehicle 's wheel . 
 Free updates to the game were released to provide fixes and updates to the game , some based on community feedback . These included : a Big Head mode , which makes all characters in the game have disproportionate heads ; a photo mode , which allows players to edit photos taken during gameplay ; the ability to use the original voice cast , with localized subtitles ; and updates to the game 's AR challenges . These included the ability to select all playable characters from the game and its downloadable content ( DLC ) to be used in all combat and predator challenge maps . Previously , each map had predefined character selection ; the addition of a harder difficulty setting on combat challenges ; more round @-@ based challenges as well as interior map locations ; and the removal of the blue wall around the challenges , which players found distracting .

Tomasi said the comic has " contained arcs , but there ’ s an over @-@ arcing story that [ goes ] right to the launch of the game and beyond . " A novelization of the game , written by comic book writer Marv Wolfman , was released alongside the game . In April 2015 , a second comic , Batman : Arkham Knight – Genesis , was announced centered around the origin of the Arkham Knight . The six @-@ issue monthly miniseries , written once again by Tomasi with art by <unk> Borges , was released starting in August 2015 .

 Aggregating review website Metacritic calculated an average score of 87 out of 100 based on 89 reviews for the PlayStation 4 version , 85 out of 100 based on 16 reviews for the Xbox One version , and 70 out of 100 based on 14 reviews for the Microsoft Windows version . 
 Dan Stapleton of IGN rated the game a score of 9 @.@ 2 out of 10 , praising the graphics , gameplay variety , detail of the open world , the voice acting performances ( particularly of Kevin Conroy as Batman and John Noble as Scarecrow ) and the overall improvement in the combat and predator systems . He criticized the Batmobile 's Battle mode as " weird " and " about as un @-@ Batman an activity as [ he could ] imagine , " as well as the difficulty of managing the vehicle 's default controls , though praised the tank battles as " good fun " . Polygon 's Justin McElroy , giving the game a 10 out of 10 , stating that the game " ticks all the boxes for the fourth entry in a AAA franchise . " He lauded the intricacy and intuition of the game 's puzzles , noting how they make the players think on a significantly higher level than past entries in the series , calling the game " nothing short of revolutionary " and " the best game of this console generation . " Steve Tilley of The Toronto Sun deemed the game " fantastic , if a little formulaic " . He felt it a satisfying and appropriately large @-@ scale conclusion to Rocksteady 's Arkham games , praising the surprises in the plot , as well as the graphics , combat , and the Batmobile 's range of abilities . 
 Andrew Reiner of Game Informer awarded Arkham Knight a 9 @.@ 5 out of 10 , calling it a " narrative juggernaut " with " the mother of all plot twists . " He described the game 's Gotham City as " a beautifully realized playground for Batman " , highlighting the distinctive boroughs and added that the Batmobile " packs a satisfying punch " with its cannon , with additional praise to the Riddler racetracks and game variety . He felt though , that the combat was somewhat easier than previous games , most notably due to the game 's " Dual Play " mechanic . Simon Miller , writing for VideoGamer.com , gave the game a 10 out 10 score and called it " the best Batman game ever made and a classic in its own right ; " a " masterpiece " . Despite the perfect score , Miller did name the Batmobile as one of the game 's faults , though lauded the " rush of adrenaline " invoked while driving the car through the streets of the city . 
 Eurogamer 's Dan Whitehead recommended the game , giving high praise to the detail of the open world and the characterization of Batman , but again criticizing the Batmobile 's battle mode feature as one of the weaker aspects of the game . GamesTM gave Arkham Knight a 9 out of 10 , praising the game for functioning without the presence of the Joker , and praising the story for its intimacy and inviting , epic @-@ scale nature . The Batmobile gameplay was described as " thrilling " , though the " least immersive " part of the game . The " Dual Play " elements were also hailed as the best aspect of the game in addition to their involvement with the Riddler challenges . Chris Carter of Destructoid , conversely was heavily critical of the Riddler challenges and their requirement for the game 's full ending , finding many to be " tedious " while others lacked any resemblance of actual riddles , such as the breakable objects . He felt that the puzzles driven by intuition were the better elements of the mission . 
 Kevin VanOrd , writing for GameSpot , awarded the game a 7 out of 10 , praising the game 's " terrific " amount of variety , its improvement of past games ' elements , the cleverness of the game 's puzzles , and the " Dual Play " mechanics . VanOrd reacted positively to the segments involving the Batmobile 's Battle mode , calling it a " delight " , and called the vehicle 's driving " slick and satisfying " . However , VanOrd found fault with some of the game 's logic , particularly the clash between Batman 's no @-@ kill rule and the Batmobile 's significant predilection for destruction . He also noted how the story 's thematic elements and repeated metaphors became exhaustingly redundant , mentioning its " ham @-@ fisted storytelling " and describing the game overall as " only as good as the world allows it to be . " Sam Roberts from GamesRadar noted the game 's satisfying cinematic value , particularly moments in which it felt like Batman : The Animated Series . However , Roberts did reserve some criticisms , calling some of the Batmobile 's additions " slippery " and deemed it a " mixed affair " ; the campaign was described as full of " generally wonky storytelling , sometimes hammy dialogue and unconvincing duo of primary villains . " Roberts praised the " gorgeous " open world and its side missions as " almost universally fantastic " , finding fault with the Firefly missions among others . The Riddler 's Batmobile racetracks were considered " beyond silly , " though he still commended the character for his increased involvement in the story . 
 Additionally , Stapleton and Paul Tassi of Forbes both took issue to Rocksteady 's marketing of the Arkham Knight as an original character , as the moniker was original but the character in the role was not . Stapleton felt the problem was that the marketing for the character indicated it was a " big mystery " to his identity , but any " moderately knowledgeable Batman fan could reasonably " deduce the identity : " We all already knew who the Arkham Knight was ; we were just hoping it wasn ’ t true because we wanted the original story we ’ d been promised . " Tassi criticized Rocksteady for promising a new character and insisting the identity " would shock and amaze us all " when it turned out to essentially be " a renamed and <unk> version of a character that has already existed for years . " 
 = = = Additional content = = = 
 Carter was critical of the Harley Quinn and Red Hood story packs , both originally pre @-@ order bonuses before being released as purchasable DLC . Carter called both " painfully " and " disgustingly " short , respectively , with the Harley pack lasting around 30 minutes , and the Red Hood around 10 minutes . He added that he expected more from the downloadable content , hoping additional " Arkham Stories " would feature more content . 
 For the " Batgirl : A Matter of Family " story pack , Stapleton offered a mixed reaction , giving the DLC a 6 @.@ 3 out of 10 , praising the unique design and atmosphere of the theme park setting , and also commenting positively on the story , the variation in combat , Batgirl 's character design , and Mark Hamill 's performance as the Joker . A prominent concern , however , was the short length of the campaign and lack of replay value aside from the rather simple collectables found around the map . He added , " worse , there ’ s no new AR challenge map where you can play as Batgirl , which means her great @-@ looking character model is trapped in this single piece of story content . Considering Arkham Knight is fairly stingy in the challenge map department , that ’ s another big missed opportunity . " Reiner felt the pack would only be of value to players who enjoy the Arkham story , stating , " Developer WB Montreal can be commended for creating a wonderfully realized version of Batgirl , who is resourceful and capable of striking fear into Joker 's henchmen , but the mission she embarks on lacks creativity and ranks among the Arkham series ' worst . " He did , however , praise the side story involving Edward Burke , the person who built the amusement park where the story takes place , calling it " twisted and dark " and shedding " new light on one of the series ' mainstays . " 
 Aoife Wilson of Eurogamer was critical of Batgirl 's characterization , calling it a " bland , no @-@ frills reading of the character , to be frank , which focuses on her familial connections rather than her youthful exuberance . " Wilson also lamented that the emphasis on Batgirl 's hacking abilities proved to be no more than a simple extension of Arkham Knight 's remote hacking environmental puzzles . She offered words similar to Stapleton 's on how the lack of additional challenge maps confines the Batgirl character model to only the DLC . Wilson was skeptical as to whether the future season pass DLC would be worth purchasing unless there was an increase in production value and a real introduction to new gadgets and gameplay variety . Carter gave the DLC a 6 @.@ 5 out of 10 , reacting positively to the confinement to the " good bits " of Arkham Knight , more specifically the lack of the Batmobile and an emphasis on puzzle @-@ solving - he also compared it favorably to the Harley Quinn and Red Hood story packs towards which he previously gave negative reviews . In contrast to Stapleton , Carter felt that not many of the environments were particularly memorable , and also felt the length was sufficient compared to the game 's previous story packs . Carter pointed out that a benefit to the game would be a free @-@ roaming option involving the downloadable characters . Meanwhile , Erik Kain of Forbes felt that the DLC should have been provided free of charge , remarking on the campaign 's shortness and calling it " straightforward " and " lackluster " . He also criticized Warner Bros. for their marketing campaign with Arkham Knight and its DLC , commenting on their sacrificing quality over quantity to continuously charge customers for rather mediocre content . 
 Carter awarded the " Season of Infamy " content a 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 . He felt that the Mad Hatter mission was " the weakest link in the chain , " calling it " a neat concept but it 's so fleeting that I barely had time to digest it . " For Killer Croc 's , Carter said the mission was " a predictable storyline " since Killer Croc is generally portrayed as a " one @-@ dimensional " foe , though " [ i ] t works better than Mad Hatter 's portion ... because most of it isn 't comprised of re @-@ used environments , and there is a nice brief reunion with Nightwing . " Speaking of the Mister Freeze mission , Carter called the exploration of Freeze 's relationship with his wife Nora " compelling " and enjoyed the fact it was the only " Season of Infamy " mission to feature a predator challenge . Additionally , he added that the Batmobile sequence had " more of a reason to exist than most of the ones in the campaign . " Finally , Carter called the Ra 's al Ghul mission " the other highlight of the pack " and felt the choice the mission gave players at the end was " pretty interesting " . He also added the setting of Elliot General Hospital was a good way to highlight Hush 's family legacy since his " part in [ the main game ] was extremely disappointing " . 
 = = = Technical issues on Windows version = = = 
 The Windows version of the game was poorly received , with criticism aimed mostly at the technical issues present at the time of the game 's release , ultimately leading to sales being suspended . On June 23 , 2015 , the launch day for Arkham Knight , thousands of users reported major technical flaws and performance problems with the Windows version of the game , with some saying it seemed like the optimization phase of the game 's development was skipped . Steam users immediately wrote scathing reviews of the game 's performance , including reports of frame rate being capped at 30 frames per second ( which could be raised , though with potential side effects ) and dropping as low as 10 frames per second while gliding or using the Batmobile . 
 Even high @-@ end graphics cards such as Nvidia 's GeForce GTX 970 were unable to handle the game well , with users reporting frequent frame rate dips and stutters . Nvidia and AMD released new device drivers optimized for the game in an attempt to address the performance issues , with Steam " strongly recommending " their download . The developer , Rocksteady , issued a statement saying they were aware of the issues and were " working closely with [ their ] external PC development partner " , Iron Galaxy Studios , to resolve them . 
 On June 24 , 2015 , Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment announced that it would suspend sales of the Windows version of Arkham Knight in order to work on addressing the performance issues to satisfy the company 's quality standards . They also offered refunds for anyone who already purchased the game . Three days later , a patch was released which fixed some crash @-@ causing problems . Rocksteady noted that they were continuing to focus on the frame rate problem , the low @-@ resolution texture , and overall performance problems , among other issues needing fixes . In early July 2015 , Kotaku reported that Warner Bros. were aware of the issues on the Windows version , with their sources stating they chose to ship the game as it was , " not to maniacally screw over customers — but because they believed it was good enough . " Kotaku Australia additionally reported that the issues would not be fixed until at least September 2015 , and that all stock retail versions were being recalled . By the middle of July , Warner Bros. announced they were " targeting an interim patch update for existing players to be released in August . " 
 On August 21 , 2015 , Warner Bros. revealed the first interim patch was being tested , with a hope " to issue the patch in the next few weeks . " The patch addresses frame rate hitches , optimization for graphics cards , the ability to change the max frames per second to 30 , 60 , and 90 , additional granular settings for motion blur , film grain , and chromatic aberration , more texture options , and other settings , and a problem with the game running on mechanical hard drives versus solid state . Lesser priorities intended to be covered include the photo mode and downloadable content . The patch was released on September 4 , 2015 . Rocksteady and Warner Bros. announced that the game would be available for sale again on October 28 , 2015 , along with a patch updating the game to include all previously released DLC and content updates , except console exclusives . After the game was made available again , it was still criticized for lingering technical issues , resulting in Warner Bros. offering full refunds for the game as well as the game 's season pass until the end of 2015 , regardless of how long the game was owned . Warner Bros. also stated they would continue to address issues with the Windows version for those who chose to keep the game .

 Glee : The Music , The Power of Madonna is the debut extended play ( EP ) by the cast of the musical television series Glee . It contains eight songs from the season one Glee episode , " The Power of Madonna " , which was a tribute episode dedicated to American recording artist Madonna . She had sold the rights to her entire catalog of music to Glee in 2009 , and producers of the show developed the episode called " The Power of Madonna " ; the show featured a number of cover versions of Madonna 's songs by the cast . The accompanying EP released with the airing of the show was called Glee : The Music , The Power of Madonna . 
 After its release , it received generally positive reviews from the critics , who frequently cited Glee 's cover version of Madonna 's " Like a Prayer " as a stand @-@ out track from the album . The EP debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart , with 98 @,@ 000 copies in the first week in the United States , the highest debut for a Glee soundtrack . It also reached the top of the chart in Canada , and the top ten in Australia , Ireland and the United Kingdom . The release of the EP saw an increase in the catalog sales of Madonna 's albums too . All songs from The Power of Madonna were released as singles with the exception of " Burning Up " . " Like a Prayer " charted highest in all regions , reaching number 27 on the US Billboard Hot 100 , and selling 87 @,@ 000 digital downloads there .

 In 2009 , Madonna granted Glee the rights to her entire catalogue of music , and the producers planned an episode which would feature Madonna songs exclusively . Series creator Ryan Murphy had worked with Madonna in the past , and wished to produce a Glee tribute to her . Madonna agreed and " cooperated in every way possible " , for the episode " The Power of Madonna " . The episode featured the show 's fictional glee club director Will Schuester , portrayed by actor Matthew Morrison , assigning the students in the club to sing Madonna songs because the girls were being subjected to sexist treatment by the boys ; he hoped the entire glee club would learn from the messages of girl @-@ power and equality in such Madonna songs as " Express Yourself " . 
 Glee : The Music , The Power of Madonna , an extended play ( EP ) containing studio recordings of songs performed in the episode , was released on April 20 , 2010 . Its tracklist encompasses " Express Yourself " , a mash @-@ up of " Borderline " and " Open Your Heart " , " Vogue " , " Like a Virgin , " 4 Minutes " , " What It Feels Like for a Girl " , and " Like a Prayer " . The iTunes edition featured a bonus track , " Burning Up " , which was not performed in the episode . Although they were not performed by the show 's cast , Madonna 's " Ray of Light " , " Burning Up " , " Justify My Love " , and " Frozen " were also used as backing tracks in the episode .

 The album has received generally positive reviews from critics . Fraser McAlpine of the BBC wrote : " At its best , it 's a loving homage ; at worst it 's like the re @-@ made pop music retailers play in shops to avoid paying proper royalties . " He felt that : " As they are essentially photocopies of the originals , the songs depend on the context of the show to make sense . So listening to the album on musical merits alone is close to pointless . " AllMusic 's Andrew Leahey rated the album 3 @.@ 5 / 5 , writing : " It 's a short release , but it also holds its ground against the two albums that preceded it , namely because the material is so compatible with the show itself . Madonna 's music has always thrived on drama , and it lends itself well to Glee 's theater @-@ pop approach , which tends to bring out the cheese in even the most serious of songs . " Nick Levine of Digital Spy rated the EP 4 / 5 , praising the " imaginative reworking " of " What It Feels Like For a Girl " , and noting : " if the Glee treatment encourages a few younger pop fans to invest in Madonna 's stellar recent hits collection , it can only be viewed as a good thing . And for those in the know , hearing five members of this thoroughly likable cast trilling " Like A Virgin " in harmony is so downright gleeful , well , it 's almost like being touched for the very first time . " 
 Sahar Ghosh from Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer felt that the best songs on the EP were " What It Feels Like for a Girl " and " Like a Prayer " , saying that " the lyrics Madonna sang in 2001 [ for ' What It Feels Like for a Girl ' ] still ( unfortunately ) ring true today , but they acquire a new poignancy as they are sung by the boys in Glee Club . [ ... ] But the best performance of the album is definitely ' Like a Prayer ' . The talented voices of the Glee cast , backed by a full choir , masterfully carry the lyrics to greater heights . " Mikael Wood from Entertainment Weekly gave it an " A " rating , explaining " Sue hilariously revises the spoken @-@ word bit on ' Vogue ' , and the Glee guys give a surprisingly tender reading of ' What It Feels Like for a Girl ' . Go ahead — open your heart . " David Hiltbrand from Star Tribune gave a negative review of the EP saying that " things go downhill as soon as Jane Lynch starts camping up the spoken portion of ' Vogue ' . By the time you get to ' Like a Virgin ' and ' 4 Minutes ' , the songs sound overproduced and melodramatic , more show tune than disco . "

 Sonic Adventure 2 ( ソニックアドベンチャー2 ( ツー ) , Sonikku Adobenchā Tsū ) is a 2001 video game developed by Sonic Team USA and published by Sega for the Dreamcast as part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series . It was released as the last Sonic game for a Sega console after the company decided to leave the console hardware business . A port for the Nintendo GameCube , Sonic Adventure 2 Battle , was first released in Japan in December 2001 , with new content . The game was later released digitally for the PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , and Microsoft Windows in 2012 . 
 The sequel to Sonic Adventure , Adventure 2 features two good @-@ <unk> stories : a hero story of Sonic the Hedgehog , Miles " Tails " Prower and Knuckles the Echidna as they attempt to save the world , and a dark story following Shadow the Hedgehog , Doctor Eggman and Rouge the Bat in their attempt to conquer it . The stories are divided into three gameplay styles : traditional , fast @-@ paced platforming for Sonic and Shadow ; multi @-@ directional shooting for Tails and Eggman ; and action @-@ exploration for Knuckles and Rouge . The game also includes an extensive Chao @-@ raising system . 
 Sonic Adventure 2 was announced in October 1999 and exhibited at E3 2000 . The game 's development took 18 months , and it was designed to be faster @-@ paced and more action @-@ oriented than the original Adventure . Its scenery was influenced by U.S. locations such as San Francisco and Yosemite National Park . Adventure 2 received critical acclaim , with critics praising its gameplay variety , visuals and music but criticizing its camera , voice acting and plot . Although critical enthusiasm had waned by the release of Battle , this version sold over 1 @.@ 44 million copies and the game as a whole received a number of accolades . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Sonic Adventure 2 is a 3D game with six playable characters , divided into two campaigns : Hero ( with Sonic , Tails and Knuckles , where the player battles to save the world ) and Dark ( with Shadow , Eggman and Rouge , where they battle to conquer it ) . Each character on each side has a playing style similar to the other characters on the side . The player moves through the Hero and Dark campaigns , switching between them at will . Each campaign cycles through levels of its three characters , telling different sides of the story . Levels have a variety of themes ( such as cities , jungles , desert pyramids and outer space ) , with some followed by boss fights . Completing both the Hero and Dark campaigns unlocks a Last Story with all six characters , culminating in a final boss fight . 
 Sonic and Shadow play fast @-@ paced levels , emphasizing platforming and gameplay . Their homing attack can lock onto robots created by Eggman and G.U.N. , and they can grind on rails . Tails ' and Eggman 's levels are slower and oriented towards multi @-@ directional shooting ; they are confined to mechs in which they can jump short heights , hover and shoot enemies . Knuckles ' and Rouge 's levels are open and feature action @-@ adventure gameplay with treasure hunting ; in each level , they must find three shards of the Master Emerald . Their search is guided by radar and puzzle @-@ based clues from harmless robots . Knuckles and Rouge can glide , defeat enemies with punches and kicks and scale walls , digging into them to find power @-@ ups . 
 Adventure 2 has the health system found in many other Sonic games . The player collects rings scattered throughout the levels ; being hit by an enemy while holding rings causes the player to drop them all , while being hit without rings causes them to lose a life . Tails and Eggman have the customary health bar , which is slowly refilled by collecting rings . Dying with no lives results in a game over screen . The characters are aided by occasional upgrades ; in one , Sonic and Shadow can bounce up and down to reach higher areas and in another , Knuckles and Rouge can kick powerfully enough to break certain containers . Chaos Drives can be used with the player 's Chao ( small , anthropomorphic animals ) . 
 Separate from the main campaigns , the player can raise Chao as virtual pets . They have five attributes ( Swim , Fly , Run , Power and Stamina ) and a moral continuum from Hero to Dark . From the moment they hatch their stats can be increased with Chaos Drives , empowering them to compete in karate and racing minigames . Their alignment gradually changes , based on their affection for a characters ; for example , a Chao which likes Tails will gradually become more heroic . Playing with Chao increases affection , and when a Chao becomes fully Hero or Dark it assumes that form permanently . Although Chao eventually die , if they received enough affection during their lives they reincarnate . 
 Adventure 2 has 180 emblems , earned for a variety of tasks . Each level has five missions ; only the first is required to continue the campaign , and other missions include completing a harder version of a level and collecting 100 rings . The player earns emblems by completing missions and other tasks , many related to Chao raising . Collecting all the emblems unlocks a 3D version of the Green Hill Zone from the original Sonic the Hedgehog . 
 The game has several two @-@ player modes . Players may race on foot through new ( or altered ) levels , have shoot- ' em @-@ up battles in mechs , hunt for Master Emerald shards or race in go @-@ karts . A few characters are playable in these modes , but not in the main game ; Tikal and Chaos from the original Sonic Adventure is playable in the treasure @-@ hunting game , as are Amy and Metal Sonic in the foot @-@ racing levels . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After learning about a secret weapon from the diary of his late grandfather , Professor Gerald Robotnik , Eggman infiltrates a high @-@ security G.U.N. facility to find it , and uses a Chaos Emerald to free it . This weapon , a black hedgehog and self @-@ proclaimed " Ultimate Life Form " named Shadow , offers to help Eggman take over the world , telling him to rendezvous at the abandoned Space Colony ARK with more Chaos Emeralds . Shadow then goes to Central City , where he steals a second Emerald and encounters some soldiers of the military group G.U.N. He flashes back to the death of a girl , Maria , who begs him to fulfill an unspecified promise he interprets as one of revenge . Shadow blasts through the military force and meets Sonic , who the military mistook for Shadow . After a brief confrontation , Shadow escapes and G.U.N. arrests Sonic . 
 Knuckles and Rouge are fighting over the Master Emerald , when Eggman suddenly grabs the Master Emerald with a large claw , and begins to fly off in his <unk> . After Knuckles leaps into the air , shattering the Emerald to prevent this , he looks for the scattered shards . Rouge intends to collect the shards for herself , but - as a government spy - she also must spy on Eggman . This mission leads her to Eggman 's base and , eventually , the ARK . On board , Shadow shows Eggman a superweapon known as the Eclipse Cannon , also created by Gerald Robotnik . Shadow discloses the plan : to charge the Eclipse Cannon with Chaos Emeralds and use it to take over the world . Rouge appears and feigns her allegiance to Shadow and Eggman , offering them a third Emerald to gain their trust . 
 Tails and Amy infiltrate G.U.N. ' s island base and rescue Sonic , while Eggman , Shadow and Rouge collect three more Emeralds on the island before blowing it up . Eggman broadcasts his threat around the world , demonstrating the cannon 's power by destroying half of the Moon . Sonic , Tails , Amy and Knuckles use their Chaos Emerald to track down the other six . They infiltrate Eggman 's base , boarding his shuttle as it launches into space . Knuckles ' Emerald shards are spilled along the way , and he leaves to collect them . He again meets and fights Rouge , but when he saves her from falling into a lava pit , she surrenders her shards and Knuckles restores the Master Emerald . 
 On the ARK , Tails reveals that he has designed a counterfeit Chaos Emerald to reverse the energy fields of the real ones . Just as Sonic is about to put the fake Emerald into the cannon , Eggman tells him that he has captured Tails and Amy , forcing him to return with the Chaos Emerald and rescue them . Sonic tries to trick Eggman with the fake Emerald , but Eggman traps and jettisons him in an escape pod rigged with explosives . Using the fake , Sonic performs Chaos Control and escapes ; Tails , thinking Sonic is dead , defeats Eggman , but Eggman sneaks away with the real Emerald when Tails is distracted . Rouge hacks into the ARK 's computers for information on the Ultimate Life Form project , suggesting Shadow is not the Ultimate Life Form , and attempts to retake the other Emeralds , but is caught and found out by Shadow before he is sent to stop Sonic from reaching the Eclipse Cannon . Sonic defeats Shadow and uses the fake Emerald to destroy the Cannon . 
 When Eggman loads the last Emerald into the cannon and tries to fire it at full power , the ARK begins falling toward Earth and a recorded message from Gerald Robotnik , Eggman 's grandfather , is broadcast worldwide : he programmed the ARK to inevitably collide with Earth , destroying it in revenge against humanity . His diary reveals that this hatred began when the government condemned his research and killed a number of his colleagues , along with his granddaughter Maria , in an attempt to shut the ARK down , and he programmed his Ultimate Life Form , Shadow , to carry out his plan of revenge . Eggman determines that the Emeralds ' energy is making the ARK fall , and everyone works to access the cannon 's core and neutralize it . 
 Shadow declines to help the others , but Amy urges him to help , making him remember Maria 's real request : for him to help mankind . With this knowledge , he races for the core , where Sonic and Knuckles encounter the Biolizard , the prototype of the Ultimate Life Form . Shadow arrives and holds it at bay , allowing Knuckles to deactivate the Chaos Emeralds using the Master Emerald . The Biolizard then uses Chaos Control to fuse with the cannon , becoming the <unk> and continuing the ARK 's collision course . 
 Sonic and Shadow use the Chaos Emeralds to transform into their super forms , Super Sonic and Super Shadow , defeating the <unk> and using Chaos Control to teleport the ARK into a stable orbit around Earth . This depletes Shadow 's energy and he plummets to Earth , content that he has fulfilled his promise to Maria , and is presumed dead . As the people of Earth celebrate , the teams reflect on what has happened ; as they leave the station , Sonic bids Shadow a final farewell by saying " Sayonara , Shadow the Hedgehog . " . 
 = = Development = = 
 Sonic Adventure 2 was developed by Sonic Team USA , the now @-@ defunct U.S. division of Sonic Team , and published by Sega . The game , directed by longtime series contributor Takashi Iizuka , was developed over an 18 @-@ month period beginning shortly after the release of the American version of Sonic Adventure in 1999 . It was designed to be more action @-@ oriented than the slower @-@ paced , more story @-@ driven Adventure . The development team ran the game at 60 frames per second with " tempo " , giving Sonic a variety of actions rather than focusing on speed alone . Its levels facilitated this flow , making Sonic seem faster than he was . 
 For the game 's levels and environments the developers were inspired by San Francisco ( their headquarters ) and other American locations , such as Yosemite National Park ( where they vacationed during its development ) and the San Francisco Bay Area . Compared to Adventure , the sequel was intended to have " more of an American flavor " . Although the game 's level design prioritized the frame rate , it was more streamlined than Adventure because of the team 's experience with Dreamcast hardware . 
 Iizuka described the Chao as a " relative neutral entity " in Sonic Adventure . In the sequel the developers expanded the creatures ' presence , adding the ability to raise " Hero " and " Dark " Chao to reflect the conflict between good and evil . For the same reason , all six playable characters have roughly equal gameplay time ( unlike Adventure , where Big the Cat 's and E @-@ 102 Gamma 's stories were short ) . In Adventure 2 Chao have the ability to socialize , so they resemble a " real artificial life form . " 
 Sega announced a follow @-@ up to Sonic Adventure and a spinoff ( which would become Sonic Shuffle ) on October 4 , 1999 . The newly named Sonic Adventure 2 appeared at E3 2000 , with Sonic Team adding video shown there to its website on June 30 . Sonic Team posted a trailer and a number of screenshots on May 30 , 2001 , with Sega promoting Sonic Adventure 2 as the last Sonic game for the Dreamcast and as marking the series ' 10th anniversary . Sega held a 10th @-@ anniversary party for Sonic in June 2001 , at which attendees could compete in a battle tournament ; the winner played against Iizuka .

 Jun Senoue returned as lead composer and sound director for Adventure 2 , with assistance from Fumie <unk> , Tomoya Ohtani , and Kenichi Tokoi . The soundtrack is primarily melodic rock , with some hip @-@ hop and orchestral tracks . As in Adventure , each character has a musical theme . The game features performances by returning vocalists Tony Harnell , Ted Poley , Marlon Saunders , Nikki <unk> and Johnny <unk> , and new vocalists Tabitha Fair , Todd Cooper , Paul <unk> , Everett Bradley , Kaz Silver and <unk> @-@ P. Crush 40 ( consisting of Senoue and <unk> ) debuted on the game 's main theme , " Live & Learn " . 
 Several soundtrack albums for the game were released . Sonic Adventure 2 Multi @-@ Dimensional Original Soundtrack was released in Japan by Marvelous Entertainment on September 5 , 2001 . Sonic Adventure 2 Vocals Collection : Cuts Unleashed ( ソニックアドベンチャー2 <unk> ・ <unk> <unk> ・ <unk> ) , with character theme tracks by Senoue and Tokoi , was released by <unk> in Japan on August 21 , 2001 . For the twentieth anniversary of the Sonic series , Sonic Adventure 2 Original Soundtrack 20th Anniversary Edition was released on iTunes on June 22 , 2011 . On October 29 , 2014 , a two volume original soundtrack was also released on iTunes .

 = = Reception = = 
 Sonic Adventure 2 received critical acclaim , with scores of 89 percent and 83 @.@ 3 percent from review aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings . Critics appreciated the game 's multiple playing styles . According to Edge and reviewer Four @-@ Eyed Dragon of GamePro , the core game 's three styles and bonus features such as Chao gardens made the game engaging to play . Johnny Liu of Game Revolution praised its replay value of multiple playing styles and 180 different goals . Anthony Chau of IGN called it " one of the best Sonic games ever " : " If this is the last Sonic game in these declining Dreamcast years , it 's satisfying to know that the DC didn 't go out with a bang , but with a sonic boom . " 
 <unk> Ahmed of GameSpot criticized Adventure 2 's camera for the " cardinal sin " of 3D platformers : forcing a player to jump to an out @-@ of @-@ frame platform . Ahmed wrote that although a player can re @-@ orient the camera with the trigger buttons , it reverts when the character moves . According to Chau and Liu , camera issues were absent in Tails ' and Eggman 's levels and insignificant in Sonic 's and Shadow 's , but searching for Emerald shards and items in cramped sections of Knuckles ' and Rouge 's levels was frustrating . Edge found camera problems permeating the game , with no significant improvement from Adventure . 
 Liu called the graphics " sweet , sweet eye @-@ crack " . Four @-@ Eyed Dragon wrote : " Sonic [ Adventure ] 2 is simply jaw @-@ dropping beautiful " , citing its detailed backgrounds and scenery and the playable characters ' and enemies ' extensive color palettes . According to Chau , the game had " some of the best textures ever seen " and was one of the most beautiful Dreamcast games . Edge was impressed by the texture detail and draw distance , and Chau , Liu and Ahmed praised its 60 @-@ frame @-@ per @-@ second rendering speed . 
 According to Ahmed , the game 's music was a step up from Adventure 's " campy glam @-@ rock and J @-@ pop soundtrack " , with less emphasis on lyrics , and Liu appreciated its more " understated " approach . Four @-@ Eyed Dragon called Adventure 2 's music " an eclectic mix of orchestrated masterpieces , guitar tunes , and melodic hip @-@ hop voices gracefully fill the game 's ambiance to a perfect pitch . " Reaction to the voice acting was mixed ; although Ahmed said " The voice acting , and the lip @-@ synching in particular , is executed quite well " , Liu and Chau thought the English voices were inferior to the Japanese ones . 
 Ahmed criticized Adventure 2 's plot : " Throughout the game the plot becomes more and more scattered and lackluster " , not focusing long enough on one element to execute it meaningfully . Although Liu agreed that despite the game 's ambitious scope and themes it failed to advance the series ' core plot beyond the Sega Genesis Sonic games , Edge appreciated the story 's presentation from both perspectives : hero and villain . 
 Despite high review scores for the Dreamcast version and the GameCube version six months later , Battle received poorer reviews : respective Metacritic and GameRankings scores of 73 percent and 72 @.@ 33 percent . Critics generally felt that although the game was still enjoyable , it was not significantly improved from the Dreamcast original . However , Shane Bettenhausen of GameSpy saw Battle as noticeably superior ; in addition to its upgrades , its action was better suited to the GameCube 's controller than the Dreamcast 's . The game sold almost 50 @,@ 000 copies in its first week in Japan and 1 @.@ 44 million copies in the United States by December 2007 , making it one of the best @-@ selling GameCube versions . 
 Sonic Adventure 2 received several accolades , including the 2001 IGN 's Editors ' Choice Award . ScrewAttack called it the fifth @-@ best Dreamcast game , and GamesRadar rated it the tenth @-@ greatest Dreamcast game out of 25 : " Despite trailing off significantly in recent years , the 3D side of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise had a surprisingly stellar start with the Sonic Adventure entries , and the 2001 sequel really amped up the action " . In February 2014 , IGN 's Luke Karmali called Battle his tenth @-@ favorite game of all time .

 Shadow and Rouge , who debuted in Adventure 2 , have become recurring characters in the Sonic franchise . With new character E @-@ 123 Omega they were Team Dark ( a playable character team ) in 2003 's Sonic Heroes , the follow @-@ up to Adventure 2 . Shadow 's own game , Shadow the Hedgehog ( 2005 ) , expands many of Adventure 2 's plot points and has a similar 3D platforming gameplay style . 
 With a few modifications , the plots of Adventure and Adventure 2 were used in the second season of the anime Sonic X ( 2003 – 06 ) . Although the American licensing corporation 4Kids Entertainment hired a new voice cast for the English version , the Japanese cast of the games reprised their original roles . 
 Sonic Generations ( 2011 ) , released for the series ' twentieth anniversary , contains gameplay elements and levels from Sonic games . Elements from Sonic Adventure 2 included remakes of the City Escape stage in the console versions and the Radical Highway stage in the Nintendo 3DS version . Both versions include a remade boss fight with Shadow , in which he battles Sonic on the Space Colony Ark , and the Biolizard boss is recreated in the 3DS version . 
 = Chinese corvette Yangwu = 
 Yangwu ( Chinese : <unk> ; also Yang @-@ wu or Yang Woo ) was a wooden corvette built for the Imperial Chinese Navy . She was built in 1872 at the Foochow Arsenal , and was the largest ship built there from the shipbuilding programme of 1868 – 75 . During her early career , she was used as a training ship and under the command of English captains . She later saw action in the Battle of Fuzhou in 1884 , the opening action of the Sino @-@ French War , where she acted as the flagship of the Fujian Fleet . Shortly after the start of the battle , she was damaged by a spar torpedo , causing a large explosion and the loss of the majority of her crew ; she was sunk shortly afterwards by enemy fire . 
 = = Design = = 
 Yangwu was a unique showpiece at the Foochow Arsenal . She was 190 feet 2 inches ( 57 @.@ 96 m ) long overall , had a beam of 36 feet ( 11 m ) and an average draft of 16 feet 65 inches ( 6 @.@ 53 m ) . She displaced 1 @,@ 393 long tons ( 1 @,@ 415 t ) . The propulsion system consisted of a 250 @-@ horsepower ( 190 kW ) steam engine , built by John Inglis and Company , equipped with four boilers and a retractable funnel . Her engines produced a cruising speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) . 
 Yangwu was armed with a battery of four 5 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) 70 @-@ pounder guns on each side , and two further mounted as chase guns at the bow and stern . These were each built by the British firm Armstrong 's . A further 6 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 170 mm ) 150 @-@ pounder at amidships and two 24 @-@ pounder long guns rounded out her armament . She was equipped with two gunpowder magazines , located at fore and aft . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Yangwu was a wooden corvette , built at the Foochow Navy Yard and launched on April 23 , 1872 . She was the seventh vessel built as part of a larger shipbuilding program at the Foochow Arsenal , and cost 254 @,@ 000 taels ( 353 @,@ 000 silver dollars ) for her construction . She was the largest warship built between 1868 – 75 out of the 19 vessels planned . The shipyard was overseen by Imperial commissioner Shen <unk> but led by staff from Western nations , who advised the Chinese to continue building wooden @-@ hulled ships despite them being made obsolete by the construction of ironclads by those nations . Chinese officials would later blame the French , in particular Prosper <unk> , for purposely providing them with out @-@ of @-@ date equipment and designs . 
 After being launched in 1872 , she served as a training vessel from 1875 in the South China Sea , making at least one journey to Japan . Yangwu was equipped with a classroom for the training of Chinese midshipmen and officers . At the time of a report in the Shanghai Courier in June 1876 , there were 30 such sailors under tuition . She had been recently commanded by the Captain Tracey , an Englishman , but he had been recalled to the Royal Navy and promoted to Post @-@ captain . He was replaced with his fellow countryman , Captain <unk> . There were two further English members of the crew , both officers , while the rest were Chinese . 
 During the summer of 1876 , Yangwu visited the Australian colonies , and later in the year the Chinese ambassadors to Great Britain , <unk> Song Tao and Liu @-@ Si @-@ hung , visited Yangwu via mail steamer in December while she was in Singapore . Following the visit , she sailed to Manila . When she arrived in February 1877 , an accident occurred as the crew were preparing a gun salute for her entrance to the harbour . As the crewman loaded the charge into one of the guns , it detonated , throwing him from the ship and killing him . The crewman was subsequently buried in the city . Yangwu proved to be a spectacle for the inhabitants of the city , particularly the Chinese , some of whom had sailed out to greet her arrival in small boats and others who watched her from the mound on which the lighthouse sat overlooking the bay . 
 On June 23 , 1884 , as tensions were rising between the French Empire and Imperial China , Yangwu was part of the Chinese fleet at Chefoo ( now known as Yantai ) which met with a French squadron comprising two cruisers and a sloop . During the course of the meeting , the French demonstrated the firepower of their cruisers , which were nearly two and a half times the size of Yangwu , which in turn was the largest of the Chinese vessels . During the demonstration , the French showed they could hit targets more than 4 @,@ 000 metres ( 4 @,@ 400 yd ) away . Afterwards , Yangwu headed to the naval yard at Foochow ( now <unk> ) , while the remaining Chinese ships steamed to the port of Tianjin . 
 = = = Battle of Fuzhou = = = 
 On August 9 , 1884 , French naval forces attacked and captured Keelung on the island of Formosa in response to Chinese involvement in the Tonkin Campaign and specifically the Bắc <unk> ambush . Shortly afterwards , a French Squadron under Rear Admiral Amédée Courbet comprising the cruisers Duguay @-@ Trouin , Villars , and d 'Estaing along with a number of smaller vessels , was sent up the Min River to attack the arsenal at Fuzhou . As they travelled upriver , the Chinese declared war on the French , officially marking the start of the Sino @-@ French War . 
 Yangwu led the Fujian Fleet protecting Fuzhou under the command of Captain Chang Cheng , which otherwise comprised three sloops in addition to a variety of gunboats , transports , launches and war junks . The Royal Navy and US Navy vessels in the port made certain to anchor a distance away from where the engagement was expected to take place . The vessels faced off for several days before the French forces made their attack , as they were awaiting reinforcement by the ironclad Triomphante . They planned to attack just before 2pm on August 23 , with two torpedo boats tasked with engaging Yangwu and the gunboat Fusheng on the first signal . 
 Just prior to 2pm on August 23 , the attack began after a broadside from the gunboat <unk> at the French gunboat Lynx . This was the signal for the small boats to move forward , and some 27 seconds later a massive explosion erupted from Yangwu . Boat No. 46 had impacted with her spar torpedo just below the waterline amidships . The detonation was so large that only fifteen of the crew survived and it was claimed that bodies launched into the air were found on the rooftops of houses over 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) away , although this was later considered to be an outlandish claim . The number of survivors was likewise questioned by eyewitnesses on board USS Enterprise , as the official report claimed that the senior officers survived whereas the witnesses suggested that the only possible survivors would have been those who threw themselves into the river prior to the explosion . 
 A report appeared following the battle of an interview with Mr. Yung , who claimed to have survived the Yangwu explosion having been stationed at the stern of the vessel . He explained that the ship had returned fire to the French cruiser Volta before being hit by the spar torpedo , and orders were given to continue firing after the explosion . Fire from Hotchkiss guns on French vessels made this difficult . But , despite this Yangwu disabled the other torpedo boat . The Captain handed Yung a floatation device and decided that the junior crew member should jump first , with the Captain following . As he swam away , Yung saw the Captain helping an engineer who had suffered severe burns but shortly afterwards the fore gunpowder magazine detonated , destroying the rest of the ship . 
 The wreck of Yangwu drifted as the French fired on her as she caught fire and sank . The victory of the French forces at Fuzhou was decisive , with losses estimated either at six or 12 personnel with 27 missing . The Chinese losses were far greater , at 521 killed , 150 wounded and a large number missing after the battle . The bombardment of the arsenal lasted for two days before the French ships headed back down the river , destroying any forts they encountered on the way . 
 = USS Monitor = 
 The USS Monitor was an iron @-@ hulled steamship . Built during the American Civil War , she was the first ironclad warship commissioned by the Union Navy . Monitor is most famous for her central role in the Battle of Hampton Roads on 9 March 1862 , where , under the command of Lieutenant John Worden , she fought the casemate ironclad CSS Virginia ( built on the hull of the former steam frigate USS Merrimack ) to a standstill . The unique design of the ship , distinguished by its revolving turret which was designed by American inventor Theodore <unk> , was quickly duplicated and established the Monitor type of warship . 
 The remainder of the ship was designed by the Swedish @-@ born engineer and inventor John Ericsson and hurriedly built in Brooklyn in only 101 days . Monitor presented a new concept in ship design and employed a variety of new inventions and innovations in ship building that caught the attention of the world . The impetus to build Monitor was prompted by the news that the Confederates were building an ironclad warship , named Virginia , that could effectively engage the Union ships blockading Hampton Roads and the James River leading to Richmond and ultimately advance on Washington , D. C. and other cities , virtually unchallenged . Before Monitor could reach Hampton Roads , the Confederate ironclad had destroyed the sail frigates USS Cumberland and USS Congress and had run the steam frigate USS Minnesota aground . That night Monitor arrived and the following morning , just before Virginia was about to finish off Minnesota , the new Union ironclad confronted the Confederate ship , preventing her from wreaking further destruction on the wooden Union ships . A four @-@ hour battle ensued , both ships pounding the other with close @-@ range cannon fire , although neither ship could destroy or seriously damage the other . This was the first @-@ ever battle fought between two armored warships and marked a turning point in naval warfare . 
 After the Confederates were forced to destroy Virginia as they withdrew in early May , Monitor sailed up the James River to support the Union Army during the Peninsula Campaign . The ship participated in the Battle of Drewry 's Bluff later that month and remained in the area giving support to General McClellan 's forces on land until she was ordered to join the blockaders off North Carolina in December . On her way there she foundered while under tow , during a storm off Cape Hatteras on the last day of the year . Monitor 's wreck was discovered in 1973 and has been partially salvaged . Her guns , gun turret , engine and other relics are on display at the Mariners ' Museum in Newport News , Virginia . 
 = = Conception = = 
 While the concept of ships protected by armor existed before the advent of the ironclad Monitor , the need for iron plating on ships only arose after the shell @-@ firing cannon was introduced to naval warfare in the 1820s . The use of heavy iron plating on the sides of warships was not practical until steam propulsion matured enough to carry its great weight . Developments in gun technology had progressed by the 1840s so that no practical thickness of wood could withstand the power of a shell . In response , the United States began construction in 1854 of a steam @-@ powered ironclad warship , the Stevens Battery , but work was delayed and the designer , Robert Stevens , died in 1856 , stalling further work . Since there was no pressing need for such a ship at the time , there was little demand to continue work on the unfinished vessel . It was France that introduced the first operational armored ships as well as the first shell guns and rifled cannons . Experience during the Crimean War of 1854 – 55 showed that armored ships could withstand repeated hits without significant damage when French ironclad floating batteries defeated Russian coastal fortifications during the Battle of Kinburn . Ericsson claimed to have sent the French Emperor Napoléon III a proposal for a monitor @-@ type design , with a gun turret , in September 1854 , but no record of any such submission could be found in the archives of the French Ministry of the Navy ( Ministre de la Marine ) when they were searched by naval historian James Phinney Baxter III . The French followed those ships with the first ocean @-@ going ironclad , the armored frigate Gloire in 1859 , and the British responded with HMS Warrior . 
 The Union Navy 's attitude towards ironclads changed quickly when it was learned that the Confederates were converting the captured USS Merrimack to an ironclad at the naval shipyard in Norfolk , Virginia . Subsequently the urgency of Monitor 's completion and deployment to Hampton Roads was driven by fears of what the Confederate ironclad , now renamed Virginia , would be capable of doing , not only to Union ships but to cities along the coast and <unk> . Northern newspapers published daily accounts of the Confederates ' progress in converting the Merrimack to an ironclad ; this prompted the Union Navy to complete and deploy Monitor as soon as possible . 
 Word of Merrimack 's reconstruction and conversion was confirmed in the North in late February 1862 when Mary <unk> of Norfolk , a freed slave who worked as a housekeeper for one of the Confederate engineers working on Merrimack , made her way through Confederate lines with news that the Confederates were building an ironclad warship . Concealed in her dress was a message from a Union sympathizer who worked in the Navy Yard warning that the former Merrimack , renamed Virginia by the Confederates , was nearing completion . Upon her arrival in Washington Mary managed to meet with Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles and informed him that the Confederates were nearing the completion of their ironclad , which surprised Welles . Convinced by the papers Mary was carrying he had production of Monitor sped up . Welles later recorded in his memoirs that Mrs. <unk> encountered no small risk in bringing this information ... 
 = = Approval = = 
 After the United States received word of the construction of Virginia , Congress appropriated $ 1 @.@ 5 million on 3 August 1861 to build one or more armored steamships . It also ordered the creation of a board to inquire into the various designs proposed for armored ships . The Union Navy advertised for proposals for " iron @-@ clad steam vessels of war " on 7 August and Welles appointed three senior officers as the Ironclad Board the following day . Their task was to " examine plans for the completion of iron @-@ clad vessels " and consider its costs . 
 Ericsson originally made no submission to the board , but became involved when Cornelius Bushnell , the sponsor of the proposal that became the armored sloop USS Galena , needed to have his design reviewed by a naval constructor . The board required a guarantee from Bushnell that his ship would float despite the weight of its armor and Cornelius H. DeLamater of New York City recommended that Bushnell consult with his friend Ericsson . The two first met on 9 September and again on the following day , after Ericsson had time to evaluate Galena 's design . During this second meeting Ericsson showed Bushnell a model of his own design , the future Monitor , derived from his 1854 design . Bushnell got Ericsson 's permission to show the model to Welles , who told Bushnell to show it to the board . Upon review of Ericsson 's unusual design , the board was skeptical , concerned that such a vessel would not float , especially in rough seas , and rejected the proposal of a completely iron laden ship . President Lincoln , who had also examined the design , overruled them . Ericsson assured the board his ship would float exclaiming , " The sea shall ride over her and she shall live in it like a duck " . On 15 September , after further deliberations , the board accepted Ericsson 's proposal . The Ironclad Board evaluated 17 different designs , but recommended only three for procurement on 16 September , including Ericsson 's Monitor design . 
 The three ironclad ships selected differed substantially in design and degree of risk . Monitor was the most innovative design by virtue of its low freeboard , shallow @-@ draft iron hull , and total dependence on steam power . The riskiest element of its design was its rotating gun turret , something that had not previously been tested by any navy . Ericsson 's guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite the risk involved . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Monitor was an unusual vessel in almost every respect and was sometimes sarcastically described by the press and other critics as " Ericsson 's folly " , " <unk> on a raft " and the " Yankee <unk> " . The most prominent feature on the vessel was a large cylindrical gun turret mounted amidships above the low @-@ freeboard upper hull , also called the " raft " . This extended well past the sides of the lower , more traditionally shaped hull . A small armored pilot house was fitted on the upper deck towards the bow , however , its position prevented Monitor from firing her guns straight forward . One of Ericsson 's prime goals in designing the ship was to present the smallest possible target to enemy gunfire . The ship was 179 feet ( 54 @.@ 6 m ) long overall , had a beam of 41 feet 6 inches ( 12 @.@ 6 m ) and had a maximum draft of 10 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 2 m ) . Monitor had a tonnage of 776 tons burthen and displaced 987 long tons ( 1 @,@ 003 t ) . Her crew consisted of 49 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship was powered by a single @-@ cylinder horizontal vibrating @-@ lever steam engine , also designed by Ericsson , which drove a 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) propeller , whose shaft was nine inches in diameter . The engine used steam generated by two horizontal fire @-@ tube boilers at a maximum pressure of 40 psi ( 276 kPa ; 3 kgf / cm2 ) . The 320 @-@ indicated @-@ horsepower ( 240 kW ) engine was designed to give the ship a top speed of 8 knots ( 15 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 mph ) , but Monitor was 1 – 2 knots ( 1 @.@ 9 – 3 @.@ 7 km / h ; 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 3 mph ) slower in service . The engine had a bore of 36 inches ( 914 mm ) and a stroke of 22 inches ( 559 mm ) . The ship carried 100 long tons ( 100 t ) of coal . Ventilation for the vessel was supplied by two centrifugal blowers near the stern , each of which was powered by 6 @-@ horsepower ( 4 @.@ 5 kW ) steam engine . One fan circulated air throughout the ship , but the other one forced air through the boilers , which depended on this forced draught . Leather belts connected the blowers to their engines and they would stretch when wet , often disabling the fans and boilers . The ship 's pumps were steam operated and water would accumulate in the ship if the pumps could not get enough steam to work . 
 Monitor 's turret measured 20 ft ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) in diameter and 9 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) high , constructed with 8 inches ( 20 cm ) of armor ( 11 inches in front at the gun ports ) rendering the overall vessel somewhat top heavy . Its rounded shape helped to deflect cannon shot . A pair of donkey engines rotated the turret through a set of gears ; a full rotation was made in 22 @.@ 5 seconds during testing on 9 February 1862 . Fine control of the turret proved to be difficult as the engine would have to be placed in reverse if the turret overshot its mark or another full rotation could be made . The only way to see out of the turret was through the gun ports ; when the guns were not in use , or withdrawn for reloading during battle , heavy iron port stoppers would swing down into place to close the gunports . Including the guns , the turret weighed approximately 160 long tons ( 163 t ) ; the entire weight rested on an iron spindle that had to be jacked up using a wedge before the turret could rotate . The spindle was 9 inches ( 23 cm ) in diameter which gave it ten times the strength needed in preventing the turret from sliding sideways . When not in use , the turret rested on a brass ring on the deck that was intended to form a watertight seal . In service , however , this proved to leak heavily , despite caulking by the crew . The gap between the turret and the deck proved to be a problem as debris and shell fragments entered the gap and jammed the turrets of several Passaic @-@ class monitors , which used the same turret design , during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863 . Direct hits at the turret with heavy shot also had the potential to bend the spindle , which could also jam the turret . To gain access to the turret from below , or to hoist up powder and shot during battle , the turret had to rotate facing directly to starboard , which would line up the entry hatch in the floor of the turret with an opening in the deck below . The roof of the turret was lightly built to facilitate any needed exchange of the ship 's guns and to improve ventilation , with only gravity holding the roof plates in place . 
 The turret was intended to mount a pair of 15 @-@ inch ( 380 mm ) smoothbore Dahlgren guns , but they were not ready in time and 11 @-@ inch ( 280 mm ) guns were substituted . Each gun weighed approximately 16 @,@ 000 pounds ( 7 @,@ 300 kg ) . Monitor 's guns used the standard propellant charge of 15 pounds ( 6 @.@ 8 kg ) specified by the 1860 ordnance for targets " distant " , " near " , and " ordinary " , established by the gun 's designer Dahlgren himself . They could fire a 136 @-@ pound ( 61 @.@ 7 kg ) round shot or shell up to a range of 3 @,@ 650 yards ( 3 @,@ 340 m ) at an elevation of + 15 ° . 
 The top of the armored deck was only about 18 inches ( 460 mm ) above the waterline . It was protected by two layers of 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ inch ( 13 mm ) wrought iron armor . The sides of the " raft " consisted of three to five layers of 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) iron plates , backed by about 30 inches ( 762 mm ) of pine and oak . Three of the plates extended the full 60 @-@ inch ( 1 @,@ 524 mm ) height of the side , but the two innermost plates did not extend all the way down . Ericsson originally intended to use either six 1 @-@ inch plates or a single outer 4 @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) plate backed by three 3 ⁄ 4 @-@ inch ( 19 mm ) plates , but the thicker plate required too much time to roll . The two innermost plates were riveted together while the outer plates were bolted to the inner ones . A ninth plate , only 3 ⁄ 4 inch ( 19 mm ) thick and 15 inches ( 381 mm ) wide , was bolted over the butt joints of the innermost layer of armor . Glass portholes in the deck provided natural light for the interior of the ship ; in action these were covered by iron plates . 
 After the duel between the two ironclads at Hampton Roads there was concern by some Navy officials who witnessed the battle that Monitor 's design might allow for easy boarding by the Confederates . In a letter dated 27 April 1862 Lieutenant Commander O.C. Badger wrote to Lieutenant H. A. Wise , Assistant Inspector of Ordnance , advising the use of " liquid fire " , scalding water from the boiler through hoses and pipes , sprayed out via the vents and pilothouse window , to repel enemy boarders . Wise who was aboard and inspected Monitor after the battle responded in a letter of 30 April 1862 : " With reference to the Monitor , the moment I jumped on board of her after the fight I saw that a steam tug with twenty men could have taken the upper part of her in as many seconds ... I hear that hot water pipes are arranged so as to scald the assailants when they may dare to set foot on her . " The chance to employ such a tactic never arose . There are conflicting accounts as to whether such an anti @-@ personnel provision was installed . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Commodore Joseph Smith , Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks , sent Ericsson formal notice of the acceptance of his proposal on 21 September 1861 . Six days later , Ericsson signed a contract with Bushnell , John F. Winslow and John A. Griswold which stated that the four partners would equally share in the profits or the losses incurred by the construction of the ironclad . There was one major delay , however , over the signing of the actual contract with the government . Welles insisted that if Monitor didn 't prove to be a " complete success " , the builders would have to refund every cent to the government . Winslow balked at this draconian provision and had to be persuaded by his partners to sign after the Navy rejected his attempt to amend the contract . The contract was finally signed on 4 October for a price of $ 275 @,@ 000 to be paid in installments as work progressed . 
 Preliminary work had begun well before that date , however , and Ericsson 's consortium contracted with Thomas R. Rowland of the Continental Iron Works at Greenpoint , Brooklyn on 25 October for construction of Monitor 's hull , with her keel being laid on that same day . The turret was built and assembled at the Novelty Iron Works in Manhattan , disassembled and shipped to Greenpoint where it was reassembled . The ship 's steam engines and machinery were constructed at the DeLamater Iron Works , also in Manhattan . Chief Engineer Alban C. Stimers , who once served aboard Merrimack , was appointed Superintendent of the ship while she was undergoing construction . Although never formally assigned to the crew , he remained aboard her as an inspector during her maiden voyage and battle . 
 Construction progressed in fits and starts , plagued by a number of short delays in the delivery of iron and occasional shortages of cash , but they did not significantly delay the ship 's progress by more than a few weeks . The hundred days allotted for her construction passed on 12 January , but the Navy chose not to penalize the consortium . The name " Monitor " , meaning " one who admonishes and corrects wrongdoers " , was proposed by Ericsson on 20 January 1862 and approved by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Fox . While Ericsson stood on its deck in defiance of all his critics who thought she would never float , Monitor was launched on 30 January 1862 to the cheers of the watching crowd , even those who had bet that the ship would sink straight to the bottom , and commissioned on 25 February . 
 Even before Monitor was commissioned , she ran an unsuccessful set of sea trials on 19 February . Valve problems with the main engine and one of the fan engines prevented her from reaching the Brooklyn Navy Yard from Greenpoint and she had to be towed there the next day . These issues were easily fixed and Monitor was ordered to sail for Hampton Roads on 26 February , but her departure had to be delayed one day to load ammunition . On the morning of 27 February the ship entered the East River preparatory to leaving New York , but proved to be all but <unk> and had to be towed back to the navy yard . Upon examination , the steering gear controlling the rudder had been improperly installed and Rowland offered to realign the rudder , which he estimated to take only a day . Ericsson , however , preferred to revise the steering gear by adding an extra set of pulleys as he believed it would take less time . His modification proved to be successful during trials on 4 March . Gunnery trials were successfully performed the previous day , although Stimers twice nearly caused disasters as he did not understand how the recoil mechanism worked on Ericsson 's carriage for the 11 @-@ inch guns . Instead of tightening them to reduce the recoil upon firing , he loosened them so that both guns struck the back of the turret , fortunately without hurting anybody or damaging the guns . 
 Ericsson 's revolutionary turret , although not without flaws , was a unique concept in gun mounting that was soon adapted and used on naval ships around the world . His Monitor design employed over forty patented inventions and was completely different from any other naval warship at the time . Because Monitor was an experimental craft , urgently needed , hurriedly constructed and almost immediately put to sea , a number of problems were discovered during her maiden voyage to Hampton Roads and during the battle there . Yet Monitor was still able to challenge Virginia and prevent her from further destroying the remaining ships in the Union flotilla blockading Hampton Roads . 
 During the " boom time " of the Civil War , Ericsson could have made a fortune with his inventions used in Monitor , but instead gave the U.S. government all his Monitor patent rights saying it was his " contribution to the glorious Union cause " . 
 = = Crew = = 
 Monitor 's crew were all volunteers and totaled 49 officers and enlisted men as the warship required ten officers : A commander , an executive officer , four engineers , one medical officer , two masters and a paymaster . Before Worden was allowed to select , assemble , and commit a crew to Monitor , the vessel had to be completed . The original officers at the time of Monitor 's commissioning were : 
 Four of the officers were of the line and responsible for the handling of the vessel and operation of guns during battle , while the engineering officers were considered a class unto themselves . In Monitor 's turret , Greene and Stodder supervised loading and firing of the two 11 @-@ inch Dahlgrens . Each gun was crewed by eight men . Thus , during battle , at least 18 men were present in the turret . In Worden 's report of 27 January 1862 to Welles , he stated he believed 17 men and 2 officers would be the maximum number in the turret that allowed the crew to work without getting in each other 's way . 
 Monitor also required petty officers : among them was Daniel Toffey , Worden 's nephew . Worden had selected Toffey to serve as his Captain 's Clerk . Two black Americans were also among the enlisted men in the crew . During Monitor 's service , commanders and several officers were replaced because of injuries or for other reasons . 
 Living quarters for the senior officers consisted of eight separate well @-@ furnished cabins , each provided with a small oak table and chair , an oil lamp , shelves and drawers and a canvas floor covering covered with a rug . The entire crew were given goat @-@ skin mats to sleep on . Lighting for each living area was provided by small skylights in the deck above , which were covered by an iron hatch during battle . The officer 's wardroom was located forward of the berth deck where officers would eat their meals , hold meetings or socialize during what little spare time they had . It was well furnished with an oriental rug , a large oak table and other such items . Ericsson had personally paid for the costs of all the officer 's furnishings . 
 Many details of Monitor 's history and insights of everyday crew life have been discovered from correspondence sent from the various crew members to family and friends while serving aboard the ironclad . In particular the correspondence of George S. Geer , who sent more than 80 letters , often referred to as The Monitor Chronicles , to his wife Martha during the entire time of Monitor 's service provide many details and insights into every chapter of the ironclad 's short lived history , offering a rare perspective of a sailor 's experience on the naval front during the Civil War . The letters of Acting Paymaster William F. Keeler to his wife Anna also corroborate many of the accounts of affairs that took place aboard the Monitor . The letters of Geer and Keeler are available for viewing and are housed at the Mariners ' Museum in Virginia . Other crew members were interviewed later in life , like Louis Stodder , who was one of the last crew members to abandon Monitor minutes before she sank in a storm at sea , was the last surviving crew member of Monitor and lived well into the 20th century .

 On 6 March , the ship departed New York bound for Fort Monroe , Virginia , towed by the ocean @-@ going tug Seth Low and accompanied by the gunboats Currituck and Sachem . Worden , not trusting the seal between the turret and the hull , and ignoring Ericsson 's advice , wedged the former in the up position and stuffed oakum and sail cloth in the gap . Rising seas that night washed the oakum away and water poured underneath the turret , as well as through the hawsepipe , various hatches , ventilation pipes , and the two funnels , so that the belts for the ventilation and boiler fans loosened and fell off and the fires in the boilers were nearly extinguished over the course of the next day ; this created a toxic atmosphere in the engine room that knocked out most of the engine @-@ room crew . First Assistant Engineer Isaac Newton ordered the engine room abandoned and had the able @-@ bodied crew drag the afflicted engine room hands to the top of the turret where the fresh air could revive them . Both Newton and Stimers worked desperately to get the blowers to work , but they too succumbed to the noxious fumes and were taken above . One fireman was able to punch a hole in the fan box , drain the water , and restart the fan . Later that night , the wheel ropes controlling the ship 's rudder jammed , making it near impossible to control the ship 's heading in the rough seas . Monitor was now in danger of foundering , so Worden signaled Seth Low for help and had Monitor towed to calmer waters closer to shore so she was able to restart her engines later that evening . She rounded Cape Charles around 3 : 00 pm on 8 March and entered Chesapeake Bay , reaching Hampton Roads at 9 : 00 pm , well after the first day 's fighting in the Battle of Hampton Roads had concluded . 
 = = = Battle of Hampton Roads = = = 
 On 8 March 1862 , CSS Virginia , commanded by Commander Franklin Buchanan , was ready to engage the Union flotilla blockading the James River . Virginia was powered by Merrimack 's original engines , which had been condemned by the Union Navy before her capture . The ship 's chief engineer , H. Ashton Ramsay , served in Merrimack before the Civil War broke out and knew of the engine 's unreliability , but Buchanan pushed forward undaunted . 
 The slow moving Virginia attacked the Union blockading squadron in Hampton Roads , Virginia , destroying the sail frigates Cumberland and Congress . Early in the battle , the steam frigate USS Minnesota ran aground while attempting to engage Virginia , and remained stranded throughout the battle . Virginia , however , was unable to attack Minnesota before daylight faded . That day Buchanan was severely wounded in the leg and was relieved of command by Catesby ap Roger Jones . 
 Days before the battle a telegraph cable was laid between Fortress Monroe , which overlooked Hampton Roads , and <unk> where Washington was immediately informed of the dire situation after the initial battle . Many were now concerned Virginia would put to sea and begin bombarding cities such as New York while others feared she would ascend the Potomac River and attack Washington . In an emergency meeting among President Lincoln , Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton , Secretary Welles and other senior naval officers , inquiries were made about Monitor 's ability to stop Virginia 's prospect of further destruction . When the temperamental Stanton learned that Monitor had only two guns he expressed contempt and rage as he paced back and forth , further increasing the anxiety and despair among members of the meeting . Assurances from Admiral Dahlgren and other officers that Virginia was too massive to effectively approach Washington and that Monitor was capable of the challenge offered him no consolation . After further deliberations Lincoln was finally assured but Stanton remained almost in a state of terror and sent telegrams to various governors and mayors of the coastal states warning them of the danger . Subsequently Stanton approved a plan to load some sixty canal boats with stone and gravel and sink them in the Potomac , but Welles was able to convince Lincoln at the last moment that such a plan would only prevent Monitor and other Union ships from reaching Washington and that the barges should only be sunk if and when Virginia was able to make her way up the Potomac . 
 About 9 : 00 pm , Monitor finally arrived on the scene only to discover the destruction that Virginia had already wrought on the Union fleet . Worden was ordered upon reaching Hampton Roads to weigh anchor alongside the USS Roanoke and report to Captain John Marston where Worden was briefed of the situation and received further orders to protect the grounded Minnesota . By midnight , under the cover of darkness , Monitor quietly pulled up alongside and behind the Minnesota and waited . 
 = = = = Duel of the ironclads = = = = 
 The next morning at about 6 : 00 am Virginia , accompanied by Jamestown , Patrick Henry and Teaser , got underway from Sewell 's Point to finish off Minnesota and the rest of the blockaders , but were delayed sailing out into Hampton Roads because of heavy fog until about 8 : 00 am . In Monitor Worden was already at his station in the pilot house while Greene took command of the turret . Samuel Howard , Acting Master of Minnesota who was familiar with Hampton Roads with its varying depths and shallow areas , had volunteered to be the pilot the night before and thus was accepted , while Quarter Master Peter Williams steered the vessel throughout the battle ( Williams was later awarded the Medal of Honor for this act ) . The speaking tube used to communicate between the pilothouse and the turret had broken early in the action so Keeler and captain 's clerk Daniel Toffey had to relay commands from Worden to Greene . As Virginia was approaching she began firing at Minnesota from more than a mile away , a few of her shells hitting the vessel . When the firing was heard in the distance , Greene sent paymaster Keeler to the pilot house for permission to open fire as soon as possible where Worden ordered , 
 Tell Mr. Green not to fire till I give the word , to be cool and deliberate , to take sure aim and not waste a shot . 
 Monitor , to the surprise of Virginia 's crew , had emerged from behind Minnesota and went straight for the approaching Virginia and positioned herself between her and the grounded Minnesota , preventing the Confederate ironclad from further engaging the vulnerable wooden ship at close range . At 8 : 45 am Worden gave the order to fire where Greene fired the first shots of the battle between the two ironclads which harmlessly deflected off the Confederate ironclad . During the battle Monitor fired solid shot , about once every eight minutes , while Virginia fired shell exclusively . The ironclads generally fought at close range for about four hours , ending at 12 : 15pm , ranging from a few yards to more than a hundred . Both ships were constantly in motion , maintaining a circular pattern . Because of Virginia 's weak engines , massive size and weight and with a draft of 22 ft ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) , she was slow and difficult to maneuver , taking her half an hour to complete a 180 @-@ degree turn . 
 During the engagement , Monitor 's turret began to malfunction , making it extremely difficult to turn and stop at a given position , so the crew simply let the turret continuously turn and fired their guns " on the fly " as they bore on Virginia . Several times , Monitor received direct hits on the turret , causing some bolts to violently shear off and ricochet around inside . The deafening sound of the impact stunned some of the crew , causing nose and ear bleeding . However , neither vessel was able to sink or seriously damage the other . At one point , Virginia attempted to ram , but only struck Monitor a glancing blow and did no damage . The collision did , however , aggravate the damage to Virginia 's bow from when she had previously rammed Cumberland . Monitor was also unable to do significant damage to Virginia , possibly due to the fact that her guns were firing with reduced charges , on advice from Commander John Dahlgren , the gun 's designer , who lacked the " preliminary information " needed to determine what amount of charge was needed to " pierce , dislocate or dislodge iron plates " of various thicknesses and configurations . During the battle Stodder was stationed at the wheel that controlled the turning of the turret but at one point when he was leaning against its side the turret received a direct hit directly opposite to him which knocked him clear across the inside , rendering him unconscious , at where he was taken below to recover and relieved by Stimers . 
 The two vessels were pounding each other at such close range , they also managed to collide with one another at five different times . By 11 : 00 am Monitor 's supply of shot in the turret had been used up . With one of the hatches to the gun ports damaged and jammed shut she hauled off to shallow waters to resupply the turret and effect repairs to the damaged hatch , which could not be repaired . During the lull in the battle Worden climbed through the gun port out onto the deck to get a better view of the overall situation . Virginia , seeing Monitor turn away turned her attention to the Minnesota and fired shots that set the wooden vessel ablaze , also destroying the nearby tugboat Dragon . When the turret was resupplied with ammunition Worden returned to battle with only one gun in operation . 
 Towards the end of the engagement , Worden directed Williams to steer Monitor around the stern of Confederate ironclad , where Lieutenant Wood fired his 7 @-@ inch Brooke gun at the vessel 's pilothouse , striking the forward side directly beneath the sight hold , cracking the structural " iron log " along the base of the narrow opening just as Worden was peering out . Worden was heard to have cried out , My eyes — I am blind ! Others in the pilothouse had also been hit with fragments and were also bleeding . Temporarily blinded by shell fragments and gunpowder residue from the explosion and believing the pilothouse to be severely damaged , Worden ordered Williams to sheer off into shallow water , where Virginia with her deep draft could not follow . There Monitor drifted idly for about twenty minutes . At the time the pilothouse was struck Worden 's injury was only known to those in the pilothouse and immediately nearby . With Worden severely wounded , command passed to the Executive Officer , Samuel Greene . Taken by surprise and confused he hesitated briefly and was undecided as to what action to take next , but after assessing the damage soon ordered Monitor to return to the battle area . 
 Shortly after Monitor withdrew , Virginia had run aground at which time Commander Jones came down from the spar deck only to find the gun crews not returning fire . Jones demanded to know why and was briefed by Lieutenant Eggleston that powder was low and precious and given Monitor 's resistance to shot after two hours of battle , maintained that continued firing at that point would only be a waste of ammunition . Virginia soon managed to break away and headed back towards Norfolk , believing that Monitor had withdrawn from battle . Greene , now in command , did not pursue Virginia and , like Worden , was under orders to stay with and protect Minnesota , an action for which he was later criticized . 
 As a result of the duel between the two ironclads , Monitor had been struck twenty @-@ two times , including nine hits to the turret and two hits to the pilothouse . She had managed to fire forty @-@ one shots from her pair of Dahlgren guns . Virginia had sustained ninety @-@ seven indentations to her armor from the fire of Monitor and other ships . Neither ship had sustained any significant damage , and there were no casualties incurred on either side . In the opinion of Virginia 's commander Jones and her other officers , Monitor could have sunk their ship had she hit the vessel at the waterline . 
 After an informal war council with his officers , Virginia 's captain decided to return to Norfolk for repairs . Monitor arrived back on the scene as Virginia was leaving . Greene , under orders to protect Minnesota , did not pursue . 
 Strategically , the battle between these two ships was considered the most definitive naval battle of the Civil War . The battle itself was largely considered a draw , though it could be argued Virginia did slightly more damage . Monitor did successfully defend Minnesota and the rest of the U.S. blockading force , while Virginia was unable to complete the destruction she started the previous day . The battle between the two ironclads marked a turning point in the way naval warfare would be fought in the immediate future and beyond . Strategically , nothing had changed : the Union still controlled Hampton Roads and the Confederates still held several rivers and Norfolk , making it a strategic victory for the North . The battle of the ironclads led to what was referred to as " Monitor fever " in the North . During the course of the war other and improved Monitor designs emerged with a total of 60 ironclads built . 
 = = = = Events after the battle = = = = 
 Immediately following the battle Stimers telegraphed Ericsson , congratulating and thanking him for making it possible to confront the Confederate ironclad and for " saving the day " . No sooner than Monitor had weighed anchor , numerous small boats and spectators on shore flocked around the ship to congratulate the crew for what they regarded as their victory over Virginia . Assistant Secretary Fox , who observed the entire battle from aboard Minnesota came aboard Monitor and jokingly told her officers , " Well gentlemen , you don 't look as though you just went through one of the greatest naval conflicts on record " . A small tug soon came alongside and the blinded Worden was brought up from his cabin while crew members and spectators cheered . He was taken directly to Fort Monroe for preliminary treatment , then to a hospital in Washington shortly thereafter . 
 Engineers Stimers and Newton soon began repairing the damage to the pilot house and reconfigured the sides from an upright position to a slope of thirty degrees to deflect shot . During this time , Mrs. Worden personally brought news of her husband 's progress and recovery and was optimistic , informing the crew his eyesight would soon return but he would be laid up for some time . She also informed them President Lincoln had personally paid Worden a visit extending his gratitude . However Worden was later taken to his summer home in New York and remained unconscious for three months but never fully recovered . 
 The Confederates were also celebrating what they considered a victory , as crowds of spectators gathered along the banks of the Elizabeth River , cheering and waving flags , handkerchiefs and hats as Virginia , displaying the captured ensign of Congress , passed along up the river . The Confederate government was ecstatic and immediately promoted Commander Buchanan to Admiral . 
 Both the Union and Confederacy soon came up with plans for defeating the other 's ironclad . Oddly , these did not depend on their own ironclads . The Union Navy chartered a large ship ( the <unk> USS Vanderbilt ) and reinforced her bow with steel specifically to be used as a naval ram , provided Virginia steamed far enough out into Hampton Roads . 
 On 11 April , Virginia , accompanied by a number of gunboats , steamed into Hampton Roads to Sewell 's Point at the southeast edge , almost over to Newport News , in a challenge to Monitor in an attempt to lure the Union ironclad into battle . 
 Virginia fired a few shots ineffectively at very long range , however , while Monitor returned fire , she stayed near Fort Monroe , ready to fight if Virginia came to attack the Federal force congregated there . Furthermore , Vanderbilt was in position to ram Virginia if she approached the fort . Virginia did not take the bait . In a further attempt to entice Monitor closer to the Confederate side , so she could be boarded , the James River Squadron moved in and captured three merchant ships , the brigs Marcus and <unk> , and the schooner Catherine T. Dix . These had been grounded and abandoned when they sighted Virginia entering the Roads . Their flags were then hoisted " Union @-@ side down " to taunt Monitor into a fight as they were towed back to Norfolk . In the end both sides had failed to provoke a fight on their terms . 
 The Confederate Navy originally had devised a plan where the James River Squadron would swarm Monitor with a party of men with the intention of capturing the vessel by boarding and disabling her by using heavy hammers to drive iron wedges under and disabling the turret and by covering the pilot house with a wet sail effectively blinding the pilot . Others would throw combustibles down the ventilation openings and smoke holes . At one point Jones made such an attempt to board the vessel but she managed to slip away around the stern of Virginia in time . 
 A second meeting occurred on 8 May , when Virginia came out while Monitor and four other Federal ships bombarded Confederate batteries at Sewell 's Point . The Federal ships retired slowly to Fort Monroe , hoping to lure Virginia into the Roads . She did not follow , however , and after firing a gun to windward as a sign of contempt , anchored off Sewell 's Point . Later when Confederate forces abandoned Norfolk on 11 May 1862 , they were forced to destroy Virginia . 
 = = = Battle of Drewry 's Bluff = = = 
 After the destruction of Virginia , Monitor was free to assist the Union Army and General McClellan 's campaign against Richmond . As the Navy always gave command to officers based on seniority Greene was passed over the day after the battle and was replaced with Lieutenant Thomas O. Selfridge . Two days later , Selfridge was in turn relieved by Lieutenant William Nicholson Jeffers on 15 May 1862 . Monitor was now part of a flotilla under the command of Admiral John Rodgers aboard Galena , along with three other gunboats which steamed up the James River and engaged the Confederate batteries at Drewry 's Bluff . The force had instructions to coordinate their efforts with McClellan 's forces on land and push on towards Richmond to bombard the city into surrender if possible . Without any assistance , the task force got within 8 mi ( 13 km ) of the Confederate capital but could not proceed further because of sunken vessels and debris placed in the river blocking further passage . There were also artillery batteries at Fort Darling overlooking and guarding the approach , along with other heavy guns and sharpshooters positioned along the river banks . The fort was strategically situated on the west bank of the James River atop of a bluff some 200 ft ( 61 m ) above and overlooking the bend in the river . Monitor was of little help in the assault because the confinement and small gun ports of her turret would not allow her to elevate her guns sufficiently to engage the Confederate batteries at close range , so she had to fall back and fire at a greater distance , while the other gunboats were unable to overcome the fortifications on their own . After Monitor received only a few hits , without incurring any damage , the Confederates , many former crew members of Virginia well aware of her ability to withstand cannon shot even at close range , concentrated their guns on the other ships , especially Galena , which sustained considerable damage and loss of crew members . After a near four @-@ hour artillery duel and sustaining numerous hits overall , the flotilla was unable to neutralize the fortification and had to turn back . Not a single Union ship reached Richmond until near the end of the war , when the city was finally evacuated by the Confederates . 
 After the battle at Drewry 's Bluff Monitor remained on the James River providing support , along with the Galena and other gunboats , to McClellan 's troops at various points along the river including Harrison 's Landing which ended in August . However most of the time spent on the river was marked with inactivity and hot weather which had a negative effect on the morale of Monitor 's crew . During the long hot summer several crew members took sick and were transferred to Hampton Roads while various officers were replaced including Monitor 's first Engineer Isaac Newton , while Commander Jeffers was replaced by Commander Thomas H. Stevens , Jr. on 15 August . By the end of August Monitor was ordered back to Hampton Roads and dropped anchor nearby the sunken Cumberland at Newport News Point on 30 August , much to the approval of the crew . Monitor 's sole purpose now was to blockade the James River from any advances made by the newly constructed Virginia II , an ironclad ram . 
 = = = Repairs and refit = = = 
 In September Captain John P. Bankhead received orders to take command of Monitor , relieving commander Thomas Stevens , and was sent to Hampton Roads to take charge of the vessel . Shortly after command was passed on to Bankhead Monitor 's engines and boilers were condemned by a board of survey which recommended that they be overhauled completely . On 30 September the ironclad was sent to the Washington Navy Yard for repairs arriving there on 3 October 1862 . 
 Upon arrival at Washington Monitor and her crew were greeted by a crowd of thousands of cheering admirers who came to see the ship that " saved the nation " . The Monitor now being a premier tourist attraction the crowd was soon allowed on board to tour the vessel . During this time the vessel was picked clean of artifacts for souvenirs by the touring civilians that came aboard . When Stodder and others came to close up the dock and ship one evening Stodder noted , When we came up to clean that night there was not a key , doorknob , escutcheon – there wasn 't a thing that hadn 't been carried away . 
 Before Monitor was put into dry dock for repairs President Lincoln , Navy Secretary Fox , various officials and a few of Worden 's close friends arrived to ceremoniously review the vessel and pay respect to the crew and former commander Worden , who after a long and partial recovery arrived for the occasion . Entire regiments were also directed to come by the naval yard and review the ship and honor the crew . Monitor 's crew assembled on deck in formation with their officers in front , while Lincoln , Fox and other guests stood near the turret . When Worden , with part of his face blacked from the wounds he received at Hampton Roads , came aboard , the heavy guns in the navy yard were fired in salute . President Lincoln came forward and greeted Worden and then introduced him to some of the others . After Lincoln 's formal greeting the crew swarmed around Worden and embraced and shook hands with their former commander and thanked God for his recovery and return . Worden called each of them by name and spoke friendly to and complimented each of them personally . When order was restored the President gave a short speech about Worden 's career . At Fox 's request , Worden gave a speech to the gathering about his voyage from New York to Hampton Roads , the trials they were faced with along the way and of the epic battle between Monitor and Virginia , while paying tribute to many of the officers and men involved . In closing he gave special thanks to Ericsson , Lincoln , Welles and all who made construction of Monitor possible . 
 While Monitor was undergoing repairs her crew was put aboard the USS King Philip and were eventually granted a furlough by Bankhead who himself went on leave . For approximately six weeks the vessel remained in drydock while her bottom was scraped clean of barnacles and other sea growth while the engines and boilers were overhauled and the entire vessel cleaned , painted , and a number of improvements made , including an iron shield around the top of the turret . To make the vessel more seaworthy a 30 feet ( 9 m ) funnel shaped smokestack was placed over the smoke outlet while taller fresh air vents were installed . The berth deck below was also enlarged and raised by removing some of the side storerooms and placing them below , thus reducing the height of the interior which now barely allowed the crew to stand upright . Several cranes were also added while interior improvements were made making the confining environment more livable . A large blower that operated with its own engine was installed which drew fresh air down through the pilothouse . During this time the two Dahlgren guns were each engraved with large letters , <unk> & <unk> – <unk> and <unk> & <unk> – <unk> , respectively . Additional iron plates were installed covering where dents were made during the previous battles . Each plate was inscribed with the name of the source from where the shell causing the dent was <unk> i.e. Merrimack , Fort Darling , etc . <unk> were also installed around the perimeter of the freeboard with a rope strung through each making it safer to walk about the deck amid stormy weather and rough seas . Monitor was finally taken out of drydock on 26 October . By November the ship was fully repaired and refitted , resupplied and ready to return to service . 
 = = = Final voyage = = = 
 On 24 December 1862 , orders were issued directing Monitor to <unk> , North Carolina to join USS Passaic and USS Montauk for a joint Army @-@ Navy expedition against Wilmington , North Carolina , where she would join the blockade off Charleston . The orders were received by the crew on Christmas Day , some of whom were aboard Monitor on her harrowing journey from New York to Hampton Roads in March , and were not pleased with the prospect of taking to the high seas once again . Dana Green remarked I do not consider this steamer a sea going vessel . 
 The crew celebrated Christmas aboard Monitor while berthed at Hampton Roads in what was described as a most merry fashion , while many other celebrations were occurring along the shore . The ship 's cook was paid one dollar to prepare a meal for the crew befitting the day ; it was received with mixed opinion . That day , Monitor was made ready for sea , her crew under strict orders not to discuss the impending voyage with anyone , but bad weather delayed her departure until 29 December . 
 While the design of Monitor was well @-@ suited for river combat , her low freeboard and heavy turret made her highly unseaworthy in rough waters . Under the command of John P. Bankhead , Monitor put to sea on 31 December , under tow from USS Rhode Island , when a heavy storm developed off Cape Hatteras , North Carolina . Using chalk and a blackboard , Bankhead wrote messages alerting the Rhode Island that if Monitor needed help she would signal with a red lantern . 
 Monitor was soon in trouble as the storm increased in ferocity . Large waves were splashing over and completely covering the deck and pilot house so the crew temporarily rigged the wheel atop the turret which was manned by Helmsman Francis Butts . Water continued flooding into the vents and ports and the ship began rolling uncontrollably in the high seas . Sometimes she would drop into a wave with such force the entire hull would tremble . Leaks were beginning to appear everywhere . Bankhead ordered the engineers to start the Worthington pumps , which temporarily stemmed the rising waters , but soon Monitor was hit by a squall and a series of violent waves and water continued to work its way into the vessel . Right when the Worthington pump could no longer keep pace with the flooding a call came from the engine room that water was gaining there . Realizing the ship was in serious trouble , Bankhead signaled Rhode Island for help and hoisted the red lantern next to Monitor 's white running light atop the turret . He then ordered the anchor dropped to stop the ship 's rolling and pitching with little effect making it no easier for the rescue boats to get close enough to receive her crew . He then ordered the towline cut and called for volunteers , Acting Master Stodder , along with crewmates John Stocking , and James Fenwick volunteered and climbed down from the turret , but eyewitnesses said that as soon as they were on the deck Fenwick and Stocking were quickly swept overboard and drowned . Stodder managed to hang on to the safety lines around the deck and finally cut through the 13 in ( 33 cm ) towline with a hatchet . At 11 : 30 p.m. Bankhead ordered the engineers to stop engines and divert all available steam to the large Adams centrifugal steam pump ; but with reduced steam output from a boiler being fed wet coal it too was unable to stem the rapidly rising water . After all steam pumps had failed , Bankhead ordered some of the crew to man the hand pumps and organized a bucket brigade , but to no avail . 
 Officers Greene and Stodder were among the last men to abandon ship and remained with Bankhead who was the last surviving man to abandon the sinking Monitor . In his official report of Monitor to the Navy Department Bankhead praised Green and Stodder for their heroic efforts and wrote , 
 I would beg leave to call the attention of the Admiral and of the Department of the particularly good conduct 
 of Lieutenant Greene and Acting Master Louis N. Stodder , who remained with me until the last , 
 and by their example did much toward inspiring confidence and obedience on the part of the others . 
 After a frantic rescue effort , Monitor finally foundered and sank approximately 16 miles ( 26 km ) southeast off Cape Hatteras with the loss of sixteen men , including four officers , some of whom remained in the turret and went down with the ironclad , while forty @-@ seven men were rescued by the life boats from Rhode Island . Bankhead , Green and Stodder barely managed to get clear of the sinking vessel and survived the ordeal but suffered from exposure from the icy winter sea . After his initial recovery , Bankhead filed his official report , as did the commanding officers of the Rhode Island , stating officers and men of both Monitor and Rhode Island did everything within their ability to keep Monitor from sinking . The Navy did not find it necessary to commission a board of inquiry to investigate the affair and took no action against Bankhead or any of his officers . 
 Some time later a controversy emerged over why Monitor sank . In the Army and Navy Journal Ericsson accused the crew of <unk> during the storm , being consequently unable to prevent the vessel from sinking . Stodder vigorously defended the crew and rebuked Ericsson 's characterization of the crew and events and wrote to Pierce that Ericsson cover 's up defects by blaming those that are now dead , pointing out that there were a number of unavoidable events and circumstances that led to the ship 's sinking , foremost being the overhang between the upper and lower hulls which came loose and partially separated during the storm from slamming into the violent waves . Stodder 's account was corroborated by other shipmates .

 After months of investigation , research and one false positive , Monitor was rediscovered off Cape Hatteras at a depth of 220 feet ( 67 @.@ 1 m ) , 111 years after her sinking . The Navy tested an " underwater locator " in August 1949 by searching an area south of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse for the wreck of Monitor . It found a 140 @-@ foot ( 42 @.@ 7 m ) long object bulky enough to be a shipwreck , in 310 feet ( 94 @.@ 5 m ) feet of water that was thought to be Monitor , but powerful currents negated attempts by divers to investigate . Retired Rear Admiral Edward Ellsberg proposed using external pontoons to raise the wreck in 1951 , the same method of marine salvage he had used on the sunken submarine S @-@ 51 , for the cost of $ 250 @,@ 000 . Four years later , Robert F. Marx claimed to have discovered the wreck based on the idea she had drifted into shallow water north of the lighthouse before sinking . Marx claimed to have dived on the wreck and to have placed a Coke bottle with his name on it in one of the gun barrels , although he never provided any proof of his story . 
 Interest in locating the ship revived in the early 1970s and Duke University , the National Geographic Society and the National Science Foundation sponsored an expedition in August 1973 to search for the wreck using a towed sonar system . On 27 August , they discovered the wreck at coordinates 35 ° 0 ′ 6 ″ N 75 ° 24 ′ 23 ″ W. They sent a camera down to photograph the wreck , but the pictures were so fuzzy as to be useless ; on a second attempt the camera snagged something on the wreck and was lost . The sonar images did not match what they expected the wreck to look like until they realized that the sinking vessel had turned over while descending and was resting at the bottom upside down . The team announced their discovery on 8 March 1974 . Another expedition was mounted that same month to confirm the discovery and the research submersible Alcoa Sea Probe was able to take still photos and video of the wreck that confirmed it was Monitor . 
 These photos revealed that the wreck was disintegrating and the discovery raised another issue . Since the Navy had formally abandoned the wreck in 1953 , it could be exploited by divers and private salvage companies as it lay outside North Carolina 's territorial limits . To preserve the ship , the wreck , and everything around it , a .5 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 93 km ; 0 @.@ 58 mi ) radius was designated as the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary , the first U.S. marine sanctuary on 30 January 1975 . Monitor was also designated a National Historic Landmark on 23 June 1986 . 
 In 1977 , scientists were finally able to view the wreckage in person as the submersible Johnson Sea Link was used to inspect it . The Sea Link was able to ferry divers down to the sunken vessel and retrieve small artifacts . U.S. Navy interest in raising the entire ship ended in 1978 when Captain Willard F. Searle , Jr. calculated the cost and possible damage expected from the operation : $ 20 million to stabilize the vessel in place , or as much as $ 50 million to bring all of it to the surface . Research continued and artifacts continued to be recovered , including the ship 's 1 @,@ 500 @-@ pound ( 680 kg ) anchor in 1983 . The growing number of relics required conservation and a proper home so the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , in charge of all U.S. marine sanctuaries , selected the Mariners ' Museum on 9 March 1987 after considering proposals from several other institutions . 
 = = = Recovery = = = 
 Initial efforts in 1995 by Navy and NOAA divers to raise the warship 's propeller were foiled by an abnormally stormy season off Cape Hatteras . Realizing that raising the whole wreck was impractical for financial reasons as well as the inability to bring up the wreck intact , NOAA developed a comprehensive plan to recover the most significant parts of the ship , namely her engine , propeller , guns , and turret . It estimated that the plan would cost over 20 million dollars to implement over four years . The Department of Defense Legacy Resource Management Program contributed $ 14 @.@ 5 million . The Navy divers , mainly from its two Mobile Diving and Salvage Units , would perform the bulk of the work necessary in order to train in deep sea conditions and evaluate new equipment . 
 Another effort to raise Monitor 's propeller was successful on 8 June 1998 , although the amount of effort required to work in the difficult conditions off Cape Hatteras was underestimated and the fewer than 30 divers used were nearly overwhelmed . The 1999 dive season was mostly research oriented as divers investigated the wreck in detail , planning how to recover the engine and determining if they could stabilize the hull so that it would not collapse onto the turret . In 2000 the divers shored up the port side of the hull with bags of grout , installed the Engine Recovery System , an external framework to which the engine would be attached , in preparation for the next season , and made over five times as many dives as they had the previous season . 
 The 2001 dive season concentrated on raising the ship 's steam engine and condenser . Hull plates had to be removed to access the engine compartment and both the engine and the condenser had to be separated from the ship , the surrounding wreckage and each other . A Mini Rover ROV was used to provide visibility of the wreck and divers to the support staff above water . The engine was raised on 16 July and the condenser three days later by the crane barge Wotan . Saturation diving was evaluated by the Navy that dive season on Monitor and proved to be very successful , allowing divers to maximize their time on the bottom . The surface @-@ supplied divers evaluated the use of heliox due to the depth of the wreck . It also proved to be successful once the dive tables were adjusted . 
 Much like the previous year , the 2002 dive season was dedicated to lifting the 120 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 120 t ) turret to the surface . Around 160 divers were assigned to remove the parts of the hull , including the armor belt , that lay on top of the turret using chisels , exothermic cutting torches and 20 @,@ 000 psi ( 137 @,@ 895 kPa ; 1 @,@ 406 kgf / cm2 ) <unk> . They removed as much of the debris from inside the turret as possible to reduce the weight to be lifted . This was usually concreted coal as one of the ship 's coal bunkers had ruptured and dumped most of its contents into the turret . The divers prepared the turret roof for the first stage of the lift by excavating underneath the turret and placed steel beams and angle irons to reinforce it for its move onto a lifting platform for the second stage . A large , eight @-@ legged lifting frame , nicknamed the " spider " , was carefully positioned over the turret to move it onto the platform and the entire affair would be lifted by the crane mounted on the Wotan . The divers discovered one skeleton in the turret on 26 July before the lift and spent a week carefully chipping about half of it free of the concreted debris ; the other half was inaccessible underneath the rear of one of the guns . 
 With Tropical Storm Cristobal bearing down on the recovery team , and time and money running out , the team made the decision to raise the turret on 5 August 2002 , after 41 days of work , and the gun turret broke the surface at 5 : 30 pm to the cheers of everyone aboard Wotan and other recovery ships nearby . As archaeologists examined the contents of the turret after it has been landed aboard Wotan , they discovered a second skeleton , but removing it did not begin until the turret arrived at the Mariners ' Museum for conservation . The remains of these sailors were transferred to the Joint POW @-@ MIA Accounting Command ( JPAC ) at Hickam Air Force Base , Hawaii , in the hopes that they could be identified . 
 Only 16 of the crew were not rescued by the Rhode Island before Monitor sank and the forensic anthropologists at JPAC were able to rule out the three missing black crewmen based on the shape of the femurs and skulls . Among the most promising of the 16 candidates were crew members Jacob <unk> , Robert Williams and William Bryan , but a decade passed without their identities being discovered . On 8 March 2013 their remains were buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors . 
 In 2003 NOAA divers and volunteers returned to the Monitor with the goal of obtaining overall video of the site to create a permanent record of the current conditions on the wreck after the turret recovery . Jeff Johnston of the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary ( <unk> ) also wanted a definitive image of the vessel 's pilothouse . During the dives , the Monitor 's iron pilothouse was located near the bow of the vessel and documented for the first time by videographer Rick Allen , of Nautilus Productions , in its inverted position . 
 Conservation of the propeller was completed nearly three years after its recovery and it is on display in the Monitor Center at the Mariners ' Museum . As of 2013 , conservation of the engine , its components , the turret and the guns continues . The Dahlgren guns were removed from the turret in September 2004 and placed in their own conservation tanks . Among some of the artifacts recovered from the sunken vessel was a red signal lantern , possibly the one used to send a distress signal to the Rhode Island and the last thing to be seen before Monitor sank in 1862 – it was the first object recovered from the site in 1977 . A gold wedding band was also recovered from the hand of the skeletal remains of one of Monitor 's crew members found in the turret . 
 Northrop Grumman Shipyard in Newport News constructed a full @-@ scale non @-@ seaworthy static replica of Monitor . The replica was laid down in February 2005 and completed just two months later on the grounds of the Mariners ' Museum . The Monitor National Marine Sanctuary conducts occasional dives on the wreck to monitor and record any changes in its condition and its environment .

 The Greenpoint Monitor Monument in <unk> Park , Brooklyn depicts a sailor from Monitor pulling on a capstan . The sculptor Antonio de Filippo was commissioned by the State of New York in the 1930s for a bronze statue to commemorate the Battle of Hampton Roads , John Ericsson , and the crew of the ship . It was dedicated on 6 November 1938 . A vandal doused it with white paint on 7 January 2013 . 
 In 1995 the U.S. Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating USS Monitor and CSS Virginia depicting the two ships while engaged in their famous battle at Hampton Roads . For an image of the stamp , see footnote link . 
 The 150th anniversary of the ship 's loss prompted several events in commemoration . A memorial to Monitor and her lost crew members was erected in the Civil War section of Hampton National Cemetery by NOAA 's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries , together with the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs , and dedicated on 29 December 2012 . The Greenpoint Monitor Museum commemorated the ship and her crew with an event on 12 January 2013 at the grave sites of those Monitor crew members buried in Green @-@ Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn , followed by a service in the cemetery 's chapel . 
 New Jersey @-@ based indie rock band Titus Andronicus named their critically acclaimed sophomore album , 2010 's The Monitor , for the ship . Featured on the album 's sleeve are the crewmen of the Monitor , taken from a <unk> portrait . The album 's interwoven references to the Civil War include speeches and writings from the period , as well as the side @-@ long closing track " The Battle of Hampton Roads . " The latter refers to the Monitor 's encounter with the CSS Virginia in prominent detail . Singer / guitarist Patrick Stickles commented while making the album that he was inspired by Ken Burns 's The Civil War and the ship itself so much that he decided to name Titus Andronicus 's second album in its honor .

 Monitor gave her name to a new type of mastless , low @-@ freeboard warship that mounted its armament in turrets . Many more were built , including river monitors , and they played key roles in Civil War battles on the Mississippi and James Rivers . The breastwork monitor was developed during the 1860s by Sir Edward Reed , Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy , as an improvement of the basic Monitor design . Reed gave these ships a superstructure to increase seaworthiness and raise the freeboard of the gun turrets so they could be worked in all weathers . The superstructure was armored to protect the bases of the turrets , the funnels and the ventilator ducts in what he termed a breastwork . The ships were conceived as harbor defense ships with little need to leave port . Reed took advantage of the lack of masts and designed the ships with one twin @-@ gun turret at each end of the superstructure , each able to turn and fire in a 270 ° arc . These ships were described by Admiral George Alexander Ballard as being like " full @-@ armoured knights riding on donkeys , easy to avoid but bad to close with " . Reed later developed the design into the Devastation class , the first ocean @-@ going turret ships without masts , the direct ancestors of the pre @-@ dreadnought battleships and the dreadnoughts . 
 = Sekula Drljević = 
 Sekula Drljević ( 7 September 1884 – 10 November 1945 ) was a Montenegrin politician and lawyer . Born in the town of Kolašin , he earned a doctorate degree in law and became the Minister of Justice and Finance in the Kingdom of Montenegro before the outbreak of World War I. During the interwar period , he was a leading member of the " Greens " ( zelenaši ) , a Montenegrin separatist movement . A proponent of the theory that Montenegrins were an ethnic group distinct from Serbs , he also founded and became the leader of the Montenegrin Federalist Party . 
 Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 , Drljević began cooperating with the Italian authorities occupying Montenegro . In July , he proclaimed the reestablishment of the Kingdom of Montenegro , but his attempt to establish an Axis @-@ aligned puppet state triggered an immediate uprising . That September , Italian authorities sent him to an internment camp in Italy after the <unk> of an anti @-@ fascist revolt . Drljević escaped the camp several months later and made his way into the German @-@ held half of the Independent State of Croatia ( NDH ) . In the summer of 1944 , he created the Montenegrin State Council in Zagreb . Drljević moved back to Montenegro in 1945 and agreed to the formation of the Montenegrin National Army with Chetnik commander Pavle Đurišić . Đurišić and several other Chetnik commanders were later ambushed and murdered on behalf of Drljević and the NDH . Đurišić 's men later joined Drljević 's Montenegrin National Army and withdrew with him towards the Austrian border . In mid @-@ 1945 , Drljević crossed over into Austria with his wife , and the two ended up in a camp for displaced persons in Judenburg . Three Chetnik agents discovered them there in November 1945 and slit their throats .

 Sekula Drljević was born on 7 September 1884 in the village of Ravno , near the town of Kolašin . Having finished law school in Zagreb and earned a doctorate degree , he became the Minister of Justice and Finance in the Kingdom of Montenegro in 1909 . His brother Janko Drljević was at that time an MP from the loyalist True People 's Party . Drljević also became an MP , and also served as a minister in King Nikola 's cabinet during the Balkan wars , and was renowned for his rhetorical skills . During World War I , he was captured by Austro @-@ Hungarian forces and interned at the <unk> internment camp in Hungary , where he grew strongly opposed to the leader of Montenegro , King Nicholas I. He was released after the war and moved to Zemun and worked as a lawyer there . He also became a leading member of the " Greens " ( zelenaši ) , a Montenegrin separatist movement which sided with the Yugoslav Federalist Party . During this time , he cooperated frequently with Croatian politicians such as Stjepan Radić , Vlatko Maček , and Ante Pavelić , with whom he became good friends . In the mid @-@ 1920s , Drljević founded the Montenegrin Federalist Party . He quickly became the party 's sole leader and foremost theoretician . He expressed support for the unity of Yugoslavia and stressed Montenegro 's loyalty to Serbian nationhood , but argued that a nation did not necessarily need to be part of a single state and hinted that he would support the restoration of Montenegro 's independence . Consequently , the " Greens " demanded that Yugoslavia 's internal boundaries be organized to match the borders of the Balkan states as they were prior to 1918 . 
 Drljević and Mihailo Ivanović had first attempted to found the Montenegrin Party for the 1920 election of a Constitutional Assembly , but were unable to do so due to a lack of time and resistance by the authorities . Drljević ran unsuccessfully for the Montenegrin Federalist Party in the 1923 elections in both the counties of Nikšić and Kolašin . He ran again in Kolašin in 1925 and was successfully elected to the National Assembly . In 1927 , Drljević was elected representative of the Zemun District on the electoral list of the Croatian Peasant Party ( HSS ) . Afterwards , he helped solve a political rift between Radić and Serb politician Svetozar <unk> , resulting in the formation of an HSS – Democratic Party coalition . The following year , Drljević unsuccessfully attempted to dissuade Radić from attending the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes prior to his assassination by Serb politician Puniša Račić .

 On 6 April 1941 , Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia . Montenegro was invaded by the forces of Germany and Italy , with the Germans attacking from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Italians from Albania . The Germans later withdrew , leaving the Italians to occupy the area . In the western portion of Yugoslavia , Pavelić , who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini 's Italy , was appointed Poglavnik ( leader ) of an Ustaše @-@ led Croatian state – the Independent State of Croatia ( often called the NDH , from the Croatian : Nezavisna Država Hrvatska ) . The NDH combined almost all of modern @-@ day Croatia , all of modern @-@ day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern @-@ day Serbia into an " Italian @-@ German quasi @-@ protectorate " . NDH authorities , led by the Ustaše Militia , subsequently implemented genocidal policies against the Serb , Jewish and Romani population living within the borders of the new state . 
 The creation of an Axis puppet @-@ state known as the Kingdom of Montenegro was proclaimed on 12 July 1941 . The state was to be headed by an Italian regent and led by Drljević and his supporters . By 13 July , this proclamation prompted the outbreak of an anti @-@ Italian uprising in Montenegro led by local communists ( Partisans ) and Serb nationalists ( Chetniks ) . Having assumed power the previous day , Drljević established the Provisional Administrative Committee of Montenegro , a collaborationist entity which was a territorial component of the Italian Empire . He also organized his followers to fight against Montenegrin Chetniks and the Yugoslav Partisans . In September , he was dismissed from office by the Italians . Believing that his life was endangered by the revolt , they sent him to an internment camp in Italy . The idea of an independent Montenegro was abandoned , and the Italians opted for a military governorate . Several months later , Drljević escaped and smuggled himself into the German @-@ controlled area of the NDH . With the surrender of Italy in September 1943 , he moved back to Zemun . Here , he became the administrator of the German @-@ run Sajmište concentration camp . In the summer of 1944 Drljević relocated to Zagreb , where he created a Montenegrin State Council in the NDH with the assistance of the Germans and Croats . He also published a pamphlet in Zagreb titled Who are the Serbs ? ( Croatian : <unk> su <unk> ? ) . In it , he blamed supposedly " aggressive " Serb policies for all past and modern problems in the Balkans , presented ethnic Serbs as a " degenerate race " and pointed out their similarities with Jews . Drljević had become a proponent of the theory that Montenegrins were an ethnic group distinct from Serbs following the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia . As early as 1921 , he had stated that Serb and Montenegrin " mentalities " were diametrically opposed . He stated : " The mentalities of Serbians and Montenegrins are irreconcilable . The visage of the former was speckled with [ Ottoman ] slavery ; liberty gave the latter a new visage . " It was not until 1941 that Drljević advanced the notion that Montenegrins were not Slavs at all , but Dinaric people descended from the ancient Illyrians . He wrote : 
 Races are communities of blood , whereas people are creatures of history . With their language , the Montenegrin people belong to the Slavic linguistic community . By their blood , however , they belong [ to the Dinaric peoples ] . According to the contemporary science of European races , [ Dinaric ] peoples are descended from the Illyrians . Hence , not just the kinship , but the identity of certain cultural forms among the Dinaric peoples , all the way from Albanians to South Tyroleans , who are Germanized Illyrians . 
 = = = Retreat and death = = = 
 In the spring of 1945 , Drljević visited parts of Montenegro held by the Chetniks of Pavle Đurišić . It was here that Đurišić made a safe @-@ conduct agreement with Drljević and with elements of the Armed Forces of the NDH . Although the details of the agreement are unknown , it appears to have been agreed that Đurišić and his men were to move into the NDH and cross the Sava River into Slavonia where they would be aligned with Drljević as the Montenegrin National Army , with Đurišić retaining operational command . Suspicious of Drljević 's intentions , Đurišić tried to outsmart him and his forces by sending only his sick and wounded across the Sava , keeping his fit troops south of the river . Following his defeat at the Battle of Lijevče Field , north of Banja Luka , and the defection of one of his sub @-@ units to Drljević , Đurišić was forced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the NDH forces about the further movement of his units towards Slovenia . This appears to have been a trap , as he was attacked and captured by them on his way to the meeting . On 20 April , Đurišić , Petar Baćović , Dragiša Vasić and Zaharije Ostojić were taken to the Stara Gradiška prison , near Jasenovac . The Ustaše gathered them in a field alongside 5 @,@ 000 other Chetnik prisoners and arranged for Drljević and his followers to select 150 Chetnik officers and non @-@ combatant intellectuals for execution . Đurišić , Baćović , Vasić and Ostojić were amongst those selected . They and the others were loaded onto boats by the Ustaše and taken across the Sava River , where they were killed either in the Jasenovac concentration camp itself or in a nearby marsh . Both the NDH forces and Drljević had reasons for ensnaring Đurišić . The NDH forces were motivated by the mass terror committed by Đurišić on the Muslim population in Sandžak and southeastern Bosnia while Drljević was opposed to Đurišić 's support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro which ran counter to Drljević 's separatism . Left without a leader , the majority of Đurišić 's men were integrated into Drljević 's Montenegrin National Army and withdrew with him towards the Austrian border . 
 In the second half of May , the troops of the Montenegrin National Army surrendered to the British and were quickly turned back into Yugoslavia and into the hands of the communists . Drljević managed to evade capture , and he and his wife sought refuge at a camp for displaced persons in the Austrian town of Judenburg . On 10 November 1945 , three of Đurišić 's followers discovered them there and murdered them by slitting their throats .

 In 1944 , Drljević rearranged the lyrics of the Montenegrin patriotic song " <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> " to celebrate the creation of the Montenegrin puppet regime that had been established in July 1941 . He was declared a war criminal at the Nuremberg Trials in 1946 . When " <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> " was chosen as the national anthem of Montenegro in 2006 with Drljević 's additions intact , many Montenegrin Serbs and unionists protested the selection due to its alleged fascist connotations .

 Surfacing is the fourth studio album by Canadian singer @-@ songwriter Sarah McLachlan . Released in 1997 , it was produced by McLachlan 's frequent collaborator , Pierre Marchand . McLachlan set about writing Surfacing in 1996 , after two and a half years touring for her previous album , 1994 's Fumbling Towards Ecstasy . Mentally exhausted , she found it difficult to concentrate on her new album and took six months off in Vancouver . After that she completed the ten songs for the album and went to Marchand 's Quebec studio to record . 
 Surfacing was released in July 1997 , coinciding with the start of McLachlan 's Lilith Fair tour . The album was a commercial success worldwide , reached the top position on the Canadian RPM 100 Albums chart and number two on the US Billboard 200 . Critical reviews were mixed ; some of the more positive reviews praised the songwriting , while the album 's detractors criticized it as banal and slow . The album spawned two Billboard Hot 100 top @-@ five hits , " Adia " and " Angel " , the top @-@ 15 hit " Building a Mystery " , and the top @-@ 30 hit " Sweet Surrender " . A radio @-@ only song , " I Love You " , was released in 2000 . 
 The album won four Juno Awards including for Album of the Year . " Building a Mystery " was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance , while the instrumental @-@ only song " Last Dance " won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance .

 Following the 1993 release of her third album , Fumbling Towards Ecstasy , McLachlan spent two and a half years touring . This long period on the road finished in January 1996 ; she was due to begin work on her fourth album in April of that year , but was mentally exhausted . She later said " When I got off the road , I thought Fumbling was my swan song , [ and ] I 'd never make another record ever again . I couldn 't imagine writing another song in my life . I had a huge psychological block for a long time . " She spent time working in the studio in Quebec but struggled to produce anything for her new album . At her manager 's suggestion , she returned home to Vancouver and took six months off . She said that after this break — and some time spent in therapy — she began to feel more in control of her creativity and started writing material for the album . 
 One of the first songs written for the album was " Angel " . McLachlan said that writing the song was easy , " a real joyous occasion . " It was inspired by articles that she read in Rolling Stone about musicians who turned to heroin to cope with the pressures of the music industry and subsequently overdosed . She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin : " I 've been in that place where you 're so fucked up and you 're so lost that you don 't know who you are anymore , and you 're miserable — and here 's this escape route . I 've never done heroin , but I 've done plenty of other things to escape . " She said that the song is about " trying not to take responsibility for other people 's shit and trying to love yourself at the same time . " Another song that she found easy to write was " Building a Mystery " , co @-@ written with her regular collaborator , Canadian musician and producer Pierre Marchand . Marchand heard her playing a guitar riff and suggested adding some lyrics that he had already written . They came up with the rest of the lyrics together , according to McLachlan , " pretty darn quickly . " When the album was finished , McLachlan commented , " I was so happy when I could let it go . I didn 't give it another thought when it was done . "

 Like most of McLachlan 's albums , Surfacing was recorded at Marchand 's Wild Sky Studios in Morin @-@ Heights , Quebec . Marchand , who produced , engineered and mixed the album , recorded it on an <unk> RADAR recorder and a Neumann 149 microphone . McLachlan played piano , acoustic guitar and electric guitar and Marchand played keyboards , bass and a drum machine as well as providing background vocals . The other musicians on the album were Jim <unk> on upright bass , Yves Desrosiers on guitar , musical saw , lap steel guitar and slide bass , Brian Minato on bass and electric guitar , Michel Pepin on electric guitar and Ashwin Sood ( whom McLachlan married in 1997 ) on percussion and drums . 
 The album was released on July 15 , 1997 , on Nettwerk and Arista Records , reaching No. 1 on the Canadian RPM 100 Albums chart and No. 2 on the US Billboard 200 . The release of the album coincided with the inaugural tour of McLachlan 's Lilith Fair in mid @-@ 1997 . The first single from the album was " Building a Mystery " , released on August 19 ; it reached No. 1 on the Canadian singles chart and No. 13 on the US Billboard Hot 100 . " Sweet Surrender " was released March 10 , 1998 , and reached No. 2 on the Canadian chart and No. 28 on the Hot 100 . The third single released from the album was " Adia " on May 4 . It peaked at No. 3 on both the Canadian singles chart and the Billboard Hot 100 . " Angel " followed on November 24 , reaching No. 9 in Canada , and No. 4 on the Hot 100 . " I Love You " charted at No. 23 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs in April 2000 .

 Writing for The New York Times , Sia Michel called the album " lushly atmospheric " but also ambivalent . She said that while the album paints a " vivid emotional landscape " , it is at odds with McLachlan 's statement that the album was about " ' facing ugly things ' about herself " ; not revealing anything particularly dark . Michel also noted certain old @-@ fashioned ideas in the album , particularly in " Sweet Surrender " , that contrast with the work of contemporaries such as Ani <unk> and PJ Harvey . She cited " Witness " as the highlight and said of the album , " [ p ] erhaps she hasn 't found what she 's looking for , but at least she 's trying . " Elysa Gardner of Los Angeles Times gave the album two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four and said it " <unk> her considerable <unk> shimmering soprano voice and a knack for intelligent , emotionally forthright lyrics but also suffers from a lack of compelling craftsmanship and textural daring . " 
 Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a mixed review , with a C- rating . He said that although he had stayed away from McLachlan 's music in the past , " between her Lilith Fair <unk> and ' Building a Mystery ' bonanza , [ he ] had to dive in , and got less than [ he 'd ] bargained for . " He criticized McLachlan 's " monumental banality " and summed the album up as " <unk> pop at its most unnecessary . " A reviewer for Rolling Stone criticized the album 's slow tempo , commenting that " if you want a piece of her nirvana , you have to go along at her protracted , glacial pace . " They said that McLachlan is too " rigid in her introspection " and that they would like to hear her " work up a good head of steam " . 
 AllMusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three stars out of five and compared it unfavorably to McLachlan 's previous album Fumbling Towards Ecstasy . He said that some of the songs were good , and praised " Building a Mystery " in particular , but said that the album offered nothing new . He also noted that the timing of the release , coinciding with the launch of Lilith Fair and the publicity that McLachlan received from that , helped sales of the album . <unk> , a staff reviewer for Sputnikmusic , gave the album a positive review , calling it " one of [ McLachlan 's ] best albums " and praising her " tremendous growth as a songwriter and a musician " . In interviews , American hip hop artist Darryl McDaniels of Run @-@ D.M.C. has said that hearing " Angel " on the radio , and subsequently listening to more of McLachlan 's music , helped him though a period of depression .

 = HMS Cardiff ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Cardiff was a C @-@ class light cruiser built for the Royal Navy during World War I. She was one of the five ships of the Ceres sub @-@ class and spent most of her career as a flagship . Assigned to the Grand Fleet during the war , the ship participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in late 1917 . Cardiff was briefly deployed to the Baltic in late 1918 supporting anti @-@ Bolshevik forces during the British campaign in the Baltic during the Russian Civil War . 
 She was then was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1919 and spent most of the rest of the year in the Adriatic Sea . In early 1920 , the ship was in the Black Sea supporting the Whites against the Bolsheviks . Cardiff spent most of the rest of her time between the world wars overseas or in reserve . The ship played a minor role in World War II as she was initially assigned to the Northern Patrol , but became a training ship in late 1940 and continued in that role for the rest of the war . Cardiff was sold for scrap in early 1946 and subsequently broken up . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The C @-@ class cruisers were intended to escort the fleet and defend it against enemy destroyers attempting to close within torpedo range . The Ceres sub @-@ class was a slightly larger and improved version of the preceding Caledon sub @-@ class . The ships were 450 feet 3 inches ( 137 @.@ 2 m ) long overall , with a beam of 43 feet 5 inches ( 13 @.@ 2 m ) and a mean draught of 14 feet 8 inches ( 4 @.@ 5 m ) . Displacement was 4 @,@ 190 long tons ( 4 @,@ 260 t ) at normal and 5 @,@ 020 long tons ( 5 @,@ 100 t ) at deep load . Cardiff was powered by two geared Parsons steam turbines , each driving one propeller shaft , which produced a total of 40 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 30 @,@ 000 kW ) . The turbines used steam generated by six Yarrow boilers which gave her a speed of about 29 knots ( 54 km / h ; 33 mph ) . She carried 935 long tons ( 950 t ) tons of fuel oil . The ship had a crew of about 460 officers and other ranks . 
 The main armament of the Ceres @-@ class ships consisted of five BL 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) Mk XII guns that were mounted on the centreline . While identical in number to the Caledons , the layout was considerably improved by moving the gun formerly between the bridge and fore funnel to a superfiring position over the forward gun with wider firing arc than in its old position , one was aft of the rear funnel , and the last two were in the stern , with one gun superfiring over the rearmost gun . The two QF 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) 20 @-@ cwt anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns were positioned abreast the fore funnel . The torpedo armament of the Ceres 's was identical to that of the Caledons , with eight 21 in ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes in four twin mounts , two on each broadside . The Ceres class was protected by a waterline belt : 1 @.@ 5 – 3 in ( 38 – 76 mm ) thick and had a protective deck that was 1 in ( 25 mm ) thick over the steering gear . The walls of the conning tower had a thickness of 3 inches . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Cardiff , the second ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy , was ordered in March – April 1916 as part of the Repeat War Programme . The ship was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at their Govan shipyard on 22 July 1916 . She was launched on 12 April 1917 and completed on 25 June 1917 . She became flagship of the 6th Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet the following month . Cardiff participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917 . This was a successful attempt by the British to intercept German minesweeping forces that were clearing British minefields in the North Sea . The 6th LCS screened the two light Courageous @-@ class battlecruisers of the 1st Cruiser Squadron during the battle together with the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron . The British lost the German minesweepers in the smoke screen laid by the four German light cruisers and pursued the latter ships for most of the battle , although they inflicted little damage in the poor visibility caused by the German smoke . Cardiff fired the most of any ship in her squadron , but did not hit any German ships . She was , however , hit four or five times herself , killing seven crewmen and wounding thirteen , but was only lightly damaged . Based at Scapa Flow and Rosyth during 1918 , the ship spent the remainder of the war escorting convoys and training in the northern portion of the North Sea . By 21 November 1918 the war was over , and Cardiff had the honour of leading the German High Seas Fleet to the Firth of Forth to be interned . 
 A few days later , the 6th LCS , under the command of Rear @-@ Admiral Edwyn Alexander @-@ Sinclair , was ordered to the Baltic Sea to support the Baltic States as they attempted to secure their independence from Russia . Together with her half @-@ sister Caradoc and five destroyers , the ship bombarded Bolshevik positions east of Reval ( Tallinn ) , Estonia , on 14 December and brought the Russian offensive to a halt after they destroyed the one bridge connecting them with Petrograd ( Saint Petersburg ) , Russia . The next day , her starboard AA gun was dismounted and given to the Estonians . The 6th LCS was recalled in early January 1919 and arrived back in Rosyth on 10 January . 
 Cardiff arrived at Portsmouth on 11 January to begin a refit that lasted until 27 February . Her conning tower may have been removed at this time and the bridge enlarged . On 10 March , she sailed for Malta to join her squadron , which had been renumbered as the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron ( 3rd LCS ) and assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet while the ship was refitting , where she arrived on six days later . The squadron was assigned peacekeeping duties in the Adriatic for most of 1919 and Cardiff spent the time visiting various Adriatic ports or in Malta . She became the flagship of Rear @-@ Admiral George Hope on 1 September . 
 By 30 January 1920 , the ship was in Constantinople and Cardiff arrived at Odessa on 4 February and Admiral Hope concurred in the decision to evacuate the city in the face of the advancing Bolsheviks . The ship departed the city the next day , but returned on 11 February and Hope assumed command of all British forces in the city . By late March , the ship was stationed in the Crimea until the Whites were forced to evacuate in November . On 6 November , Cardiff picked up Charles I of Austria , the last Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary , and his wife , Zita at <unk> , Romania , and conveyed them to their exile in the Portuguese island of Madeira , where they arrived on 19 November . The ship was present during the Great Fire of Smyrna almost a year later in mid @-@ September 1922 , close to the end of the Greco @-@ Turkish War of 1919 – 22 . She remained in the Mediterranean until 1929 when she went home for a lengthy refit . During Cardiff 's time in the Mediterranean , she was fitted with a pair of 2 @-@ pounder ( 40 mm ) Mk II " pom @-@ pom " AA guns in 1923 – 24 and her original 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) rangefinders was exchanged for 12 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) models during the mid @-@ 1920s . From 1931 to May 1933 , she was assigned to the Africa Station as the flagship of the 6th Cruiser Squadron . The ship returned home that month and replaced her half @-@ sister Cambrian as flagship of the Nore Reserve in July . The following year , she was transferred to the Chatham Reserve as their flagship and participated in the Silver Jubilee Fleet review for King George V on 16 July 1935 . Cardiff was also present for the Coronation Fleet Review for King George VI on 20 May 1937 . The ship was considered for conversion into an anti @-@ aircraft cruiser in June 1938 , but programme delays caused the conversion to be pushed back . A month later , Cardiff was recommissioned for service with the 5th Cruiser Squadron on the China Station . The ship departed Hong Kong on 29 April 1939 for the UK where she was again placed in reserve . 
 = = = Second World War = = = 
 On the first day of the war on 3 September 1939 , Cardiff was assigned to the 12th Cruiser Squadron which was fruitlessly searching for returning German merchant ships in the North and Norwegian Seas . Several days later , she was assigned to patrol the gaps between the Shetland and Faeroe Islands and between the Faeroes and Iceland as part of the Northern Patrol . In late November , she fruitlessly searched for the German battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst after they sank the armed merchant cruiser , Rawalpindi , on the 23rd . On 12 June , Cardiff was tasked to suppress the German artillery batteries overlooking Saint @-@ Valery @-@ en @-@ Caux to prevent them from firing on British ships as they evacuated the troops there , but they were no longer visible from the sea when the ship arrived . The cruiser received six wounded men from the coaster Cameo and returned to Portsmouth . Cardiff was converted for use as a gunnery training ship in October and served in that capacity for the rest of the war . The ship was fitted with six 20 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) Oerlikon light AA guns and a Type 290 surface @-@ search radar by April 1942 . By late 1943 a Type 273 long @-@ range search radar had also been fitted . Cardiff was paid off on 3 September 1945 and sold for scrap to Arnott Young on 23 January 1946 . The ship was broken up in Dalmuir , Scotland , after she arrived there on 18 March .
