 Wanderers were the reigning cup holders and had also won the tournament in both 1872 and 1873 . Oxford University had won the competition in 1874 . Both teams entered the competition at the first round stage and were allocated home matches against Saffron Walden and Old Salopians respectively . Neither match took place , however , as in each case the away team withdrew from the competition , giving their opponents a bye into the next round . In the second round , Wanderers and Oxford both scored six goals , defeating Southall and 105th Regiment respectively . 
 In the third round , Wanderers beat Pilgrims 3 – 0 and Oxford again progressed without playing when their scheduled opponents , the leading Scottish club Queen 's Park , withdrew . Wanderers themselves progressed through the quarter @-@ finals on a bye as an uneven number of teams remained in the competition . Oxford were held to a goalless draw by Upton Park , but emerged victorious after a replay two weeks later . In the semi @-@ finals Oxford received a bye , progressing straight to the final , and Wanderers beat the other of the great universities , Cambridge University , 1 – 0 .

 = = = Summary = = = 
 Both teams chose to play with two full @-@ backs , two half @-@ backs and six forwards , in keeping with the attacking style of play generally employed at the time . Arthur Kinnaird played in goal for Wanderers , even though he had played as a forward in three earlier cup final appearances . At the time , the position of goalkeeper was not considered a specialised one , and players often alternated between playing in goal and playing in outfield positions . The game was played at Kennington Oval , home of Surrey County Cricket Club and took place in extremely bad weather , with rain and sleet hampering the players . Wanderers won the coin toss and chose to begin the match defending the Harleyford Road end of the stadium . 
 The Wanderers players began the game in relative disarray , which the correspondent from The Sportsman reported was not an uncommon feature of their matches . After fifteen minutes Oxford were awarded a corner kick , which Evelyn Waddington kicked high towards the goal . Kinnaird caught the ball , but in doing so stepped behind the goal @-@ line . The Oxford players immediately appealed for a goal to be awarded , and after a consultation the officials did so , giving the University team the lead . Some time later , Charles Wollaston was injured and swapped positions with Kinnaird . At the time the concept of substitution had not been introduced to the sport , so injured players were obliged to remain in the game unless they were completely unable to play on , but it was common for an injured player to " retire into goal " , where it was felt he would be less of a liability . 
 As Wanderers pressed for an equaliser , Francis Birley took an indirect free kick , which went into the Oxford goal , but no goal was awarded as the ball had gone straight in without touching another player . Four minutes from the end of the game , Hubert Heron made what The Field called a " splendid run " and passed the ball to Jarvis Kenrick , whose shot eluded Oxford goalkeeper Edward Alington to level the scores and send the game into extra time . Seven minutes into the extra period , William Lindsay 's <unk> shot was headed away by an Oxford player but the ball rebounded to Lindsay who sent it past Alington to give Wanderers a lead which the cup holders kept until the end of the game and thus retained the trophy .

 Some time after the match , Kinnaird informed the council of the Football Association ( FA ) , of which he was a member , that in his opinion he had not carried the ball over the line for Oxford 's goal . Despite the fact that the referee had awarded the goal and multiple newspaper reports stated that the ball had clearly gone over the line , Kinnaird 's fellow council members took his word for it , and struck the goal from the records , changing the official score to 2 – 0 ( although if Oxford had not scored , there would have been no reason for the game to go to extra time , so by rights they should have annulled Wanderers ' second goal as well ) . For the next century , all sources reported the score of the match as 2 – 0 . In the 1980s , after fresh research into contemporary reports of the game by football historians , the FA reinstated the Oxford goal , and now regard the official final score of the 1877 final as 2 – 1 .

 On August 29 , 2013 , an accompanying music video for the song was released on Aguilera 's official channel . It features cameo appearances from Nicole Richie , Christina Milian , Chris Mann , Aguilera 's son Max Bratman and her current boyfriend Matthew <unk> . The video sees everybody makes the " L " sign for the word " love " , alongside positive messages , such as " Racism sucks " , " Accept " , and " Amo a mi hijo gay " ( " I love my gay son " ) . It was described as a " soulful , and completely inexplicable , letter to her fans thanking them for their undying love " . To promote Lotus and the song , Aguilera performed " Let There Be Love " at the 40th American Music Awards and on The Voice in the United States .

 Following the release of her sixth studio album , Bionic ( 2010 ) , Aguilera filed for divorce from her husband Jordan Bratman , starred in her first feature film , Burlesque and recorded the accompanying soundtrack . She then became a coach on NBC 's singing competition show The Voice and appeared as a featured artist on Maroon 5 's single " Moves Like Jagger " ( 2011 ) , which spent four weeks atop the US Billboard Hot 100 chart . Following these events , Aguilera announced that had plans to begin production of her seventh album , stating that she wanted high quality and " personal " songs for the record . Regarding the creative direction , she revealed that the album would be a " culmination of everything I 've experienced up until this point ... I 've been through a lot since the release of my last album , being on ( ' The Voice ' ) , having had a divorce ... This is all sort of a free rebirth for me . " She further said " I 'm embracing many different things , but it 's all feel @-@ good , super @-@ expressive [ and ] super @-@ vulnerable . " Aguilera continued to say that the album would be about " self – expression and freedom " because of the personal struggles she had overcome during the last couple of years . 
 Speaking about her new material during an interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 2012 , Aguilera said that the recording process for Lotus was taking a while because " I don 't like to just get songs from producers . I like them to come from a personal place ... I 'm very excited . It 's fun , exciting , introspective , it 's going to be great " . Recorded at MXM Studios by Shellback in Stockholm , Sweden , " Let There Be Love " was written by Max Martin , Savan Kotecha , Bonnie McKee , Oliver Goldstein , Oscar Holter and Jakke Erixson . It was produced by Martin and Shellback . Aguilera 's vocals were recorded by Oscar Ramirez at The Red Lips Room in Beverly Hills in California ; the background vocals engineer was Sam Holland . Programming and keyboards were carried out by Shellback and additional keyboards were performed by Holter , Erixson and Martin .

 Aguilera explained how she and Max Martin had met early on in her career , but it was a creative and mutual decision not to collaborate with each other at that stage in her career as she wanted to explore different avenues . However , she felt at this point in her career with Lotus , it was the right time to work together , stating : 
 I definitely don 't go the straight and narrow path , and you know , I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate . And so , I think it 's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that , because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker . But when I was coming out it was at a time when we had the huge pop explosion , and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do " Beautiful " and songs like that . We built a level of respect for each other . So at this point , coming together , especially embracing my true pop @-@ <unk> , at this point in my career having come full circle , I was able to really truly embrace it , and embrace him . He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs , and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared , I was like ' Oh my God ! I won 't be able to collaborate here . ' But he couldn 't have been more great , and this is a really fun song , super up @-@ tempo . It 's probably the most dancey @-@ ish song on my record , but it 's called ' Let There Be Love ' but it 's free and representative of what this album is about . 
 = = Composition and lyrics = = 
 " Let There Be Love " combines a multitude of genres . It is a dance @-@ pop , electronic dance music ( EDM ) , and pop music song . It also contains electronica and trance influences . It lasts for a duration of three minutes and 22 seconds . The instrumental consists of " a propulsive beat and chewy synths " , as well as " loud drums " and " overwhelming " electronica . According to Kitty Empire for The Guardian , the song is " about as formulaic as club pop gets " but " resonates effectively . " Andrew Hampp for Billboard compared the song 's instrumental to two songs recorded by Usher , " DJ Got Us Fallin ' in Love " and " Scream " , both of which were produced by Martin . He also noted that Aguilera was probably aware that the " Let There Be Love " ' s melody bared strong resemblances to the songs , which most likely prompted her to spend " the last minute wailing all over the place . " Aguilera " roars " the lyrics " Let there be let there be love / Here in the here in the dark " over trance beats and projects a " saucy " tone as she sings " " Hit the right spot , making my eyes roll back . "

 " Let There Be Love " garnered positive reviews from music critics . Stephen Thomas Erlewine for Allmusic complimented Aguilera 's approach to the song , writing that she sounds " comfortable " and " fresh , " while Andrew Hampp for Billboard wrote that it is a club friendly song but does not show much personality . Chris Younie for 4Music thought that it is obvious from the " initial stabs of synth " that " Let There Be Love " will resonate " Ibiza type " beats . He continued to write that Aguilera had managed to create a " dance anthem " without the assistance of Calvin Harris . The Huffington Post writer Mesfin Fekadu thought that Martin 's production of " Let There Be Love " was superior to " Your Body " , citing it as " typical " but potentially successful on radio . Jim Farber for New York Daily News praised the song , writing that it is " a prime disco diva anthem " . 
 MTV News writer Christina Garibaldi praised the uptempo track , writing that its " heavy beat " and " sultry lyrics " were perfect for people to dance to in nightclubs . Jenna Hally Rubenstein for MTV Buzzworthy noted that it is easy to become addicted to listening to " Let There Be Love " , and that Aguilera 's vocals " prevail above the noise . " Both Sam Lanksy and Mike Wass for Idolator reviewed " Let There Be Love " : Lanksy predicted that the song had the potential to be a " monster hit " , and complimented Aguilera for not over singing the song , which he described as " epic . " Wass shared Lanksy 's sentiments and elaborated that the production serves as the " perfect destination " for her " powerhouse pipes " . Michael Gallucci for PopCrush thought that the song was not quite as good as " Your Body " and described it as " typical pop . " However , he criticized Aguilera 's vocal performance , stating that her " big voice " should be able to be heard above the instrumental . 
 Slant Magazine 's Sal Cinquemani thought that " Let There Be Love " would have been a better lead single choice than " Your Body " , as she felt it would have ensured Aguilera a greater comeback . Cinquemani described the song as " a virtual hybrid of recent club bangers by Rihanna , Britney , Katy , and Ke $ ha . " Robert Copsey for Digital Spy thought that the song 's weakness is also its strength , describing it as " a massive clubby <unk> that is ultimately throwaway , but in the best possible way . " Annie Zaleski for The A.V. Club criticized the song as " faceless Top 40 EDM . " Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly found the " bouncy peace @-@ flag @-@ waver " lyrics of the song contradictory and difficult to comprehend because of " a bonus track called ' Shut Up ' that invites the haters to ' suck my [ dick ] .

 Aguilera performed " Let There Be Love " for the first time at the 40th American Music Awards on November 18 , 2012 , held at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles , California . As one of the first singers to be announced as a performer at the award ceremony on October 19 , 2012 , Aguilera sang " Let There Be Love " as part of a medley with two other tracks from Lotus : " Lotus Intro " and " Army of Me " . During an interview with MTV News , Aguilera revealed what the performance would be like and the creative direction behind it : 
 It 's very exciting . It 's definitely going to be a reflection of what Lotus means to me . If you take that album cover and give it a little performance twist , I 'll bring that album cover to life , so it 's going to be really fun . I can 't give too much away about the songs , but it 's definitely going to represent the album because the album is very multilayered . It doesn 't represent ' Your Body ' as a single tone . It has its ballads ; and everything comes from a very sincere , deep – rooted place whether it 's having fun or being vulnerable . 
 Wearing a " fuller – figure " " cinched in corset " designed by The Blonds , who also design outfits for Lady Gaga , Leah Simpson for the Daily Mail wrote that Aguilera put a " sexy twist on patriotism with a star – spangled bodysuit and managed to get a few pulses racing in the over – the – top ensemble . " The performance featured dance routines and dancers wearing " torture bags labelled the words ' Freak ' and ' Queen ' over their heads . " Bruna Nessif for E ! Online described the performance as " interesting , " and noted that the theme " to celebrate everyone for who they are " was similar to the moral content presented on Gaga 's album Born This Way ( 2011 ) . As Aguilera finished her set , she was joined on stage by Pitbull to perform his song " Feel This Moment " , on which she is a featured artist . Aguilera also performed " Let There Be Love " with her team of aspiring singers on The Voice , a singing competition on which she is a coach .

 = Halt im Gedächtnis Jesum Christ , BWV 67 = 
 Halt im Gedächtnis Jesum Christ ( Keep Jesus Christ in mind ) , BWV 67 , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach . He composed it in Leipzig for <unk> , the first Sunday after Easter , and first performed it on 16 April 1724 . 
 Based on the prescribed gospel of the appearance of Jesus to the Disciples , first without then with Thomas , an unknown poet compares the situation of the doubtful Thomas to the Christian in general . He places Nikolaus Herman 's Easter hymn " Erschienen ist der herrlich Tag " in the centre of the cantata , repeats the line " Friede sei mit euch " ( Peace be with you ) several times , and ends with the first stanza from Jakob Ebert 's hymn " Du Friedefürst , Herr Jesu Christ " ( Thou Prince of Peace , Lord Jesus Christ ) . Bach structured the work in seven movements , arranged in symmetry around the central chorale , and scored it for three solo voices , a four @-@ part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of a slide horn for hymn tunes , flauto traverso , two oboes d 'amore , strings and basso continuo . Besides the unusual central chorale , the cantata contains a dramatic <unk> with Jesus repeating " Peace be with you " against the enemies . 
 = = History and words = = 
 Bach composed the cantata in his first year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig , shortly after he first performed his St John Passion , for the First Sunday after Easter , called <unk> . The prescribed readings for that Sunday were from the First Epistle of John , " our faith is the victory " ( 1 John 5 : 4 – 10 ) , and from the Gospel of John , the appearance of Jesus to the Disciples , first without then with Thomas , in Jerusalem ( John 20 : 19 – 31 ) . The unknown poet begins with a verse from the Second Epistle to Timothy , " Remember that Jesus Christ … was raised from the dead " ( 2 Timothy 2 : 8 ) . The poet sees Thomas as similar to the doubtful Christian in general , whose heart is not at peace . The center of the cantata is the Easter hymn " Erschienen ist der herrlich Tag " ( The glorious day has appeared ) by Nikolaus Herman ( 1560 ) , praising the day of the resurrection . In contrast , movement 5 recalls the danger by the enemies , until in movement 6 Jesus appears , as he did to his disciples in Jerusalem , finally bringing peace . The line " Friede sei mit euch " ( Peace be with you ) is repeated four times , framing three stanzas of a poem . The closing chorale is the first stanza of " Du Friedefürst , Herr Jesu Christ " ( Thou Prince of Peace , Lord Jesus Christ ) by Jakob Ebert ( 1601 ) . 
 Bach led the first performance on 16 April 1724 . 
 = = Structure and scoring = = 
 Bach structured the cantata in seven movements , arranged symmetrically around a central chorale . He scored the work for three vocal soloists ( alto , tenor , bass ) , a four @-@ part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of corno da <unk> ( Ct , a slide horn that Bach scored for a short period ) , flauto traverso ( Ft ) , two oboes d 'amore ( Oa ) , two violins ( Vl ) , viola ( Va ) , and basso continuo . 
 In the following table of the movements , the scoring follows the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe . The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr , using the symbol for common time ( 4 / 4 ) . The continuo , playing throughout , is not shown . 
 = = Music = = 
 The opening chorus reflects the contrast of hope and resurrection versus simultaneous remembrance and doubt , which is present throughout the cantata . The chorus is structured in symmetry in seven sections , beginning with an instrumental sinfonia of all instruments , the horn introducing a theme representing remembrance in a melody which resembles the choral tune of " O Lamm Gottes , <unk> " which Bach would later use as a cantus firmus in the opening movement of his St Matthew Passion . Bach thus alludes to the idea that Jesus suffered innocently for the " sins of the world " before he rose again . In the second section , this melody is sung by the sopranos , while the lower voices stress the word " Halt " ( hold ) by several homophonic chords . In the third section , the sopranos repeat the melody in a fugue , while the altos simultaneously sing a countersubject that rises in fast movement for more than an octave , illustrating the resurrection . The fourth section is a reprise of the sinfonia with the voices added , then a variation of sections 2 to 4 follows as 5 to 7 . 
 The tenor aria Mein Jesus ist <unk> ( My Jesus is arisen ) is accompanied by an obbligato oboe d 'amore . The theme is presented in the opening by the strings and later picked up by the voice , illustrating the word " <unk> " by an upward run . 
 The Easter hymn " Erschienen ist der herrlich Tag " marks the center of the composition . In symmetry , it is framed by two alto recitatives , the second a reprise of the first . 
 The idea of a solo singer alternating with a chorus is extended in the following movement , the bass aria with chorus Friede sei mit euch ( Peace be with you ) . A string introduction depicts in agitated forte passages in 4 / 4 time the attack of the enemies . John Eliot Gardiner describes it as " a dramatic scena in which the strings work up a storm to illustrate the raging of the soul 's enemies " . In sharp contrast the bass as the vox Christi ( voice of Christ ) sings the greeting of Jesus from verse 19 of the Gospel , " Peace be with you " , three times , accompanied by woodwinds in dotted rhythm in 3 / 4 time , marked piano . Musicologist Julian Mincham describes the music as serene , a " gentle , rocking , almost cradle @-@ like rhythm creating a perfect atmosphere of peaceful contemplation " . The upper voices of the choir ( without basses ) answer to the music of the introduction , seeing Jesus as help in the battle ( " <unk> uns <unk> und die Wut der Feinde <unk> " ) . The greeting and answering is repeated two more times in two stanzas of the poem , reflecting the strengthening of the weary in spirit and body ( " <unk> in uns <unk> Geist und Leib <unk> " ) , and finally overcoming death ( " durch den Tod <unk> zu dringen " ) . The following fourth appearance of " Peace be with you " is accompanied by both woodwinds and strings , and peace is finally achieved . Klaus Hofmann describes the movement as an " operatic scene " and continues " Bach resorts to unconventional means ; he shows himself as a musical dramatist and , in the process , stresses the element of contrast : he comments upon the words of the faithful with agitated , tumultuous string figures , whilst Jesus ' peace greeting sounds calmly and majestically , embedded in pastoral wind sonorities . " Bach adapted this movement as the Gloria of his Missa in A major , BWV 234 . 
 The closing chorale " Du Friedefürst , Herr Jesu Christ " is a four @-@ part setting .

 " Arcadia " is the fifteenth episode of the sixth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on March 7 , 1999 . The episode was written by Daniel Arkin and directed by Michael Watkins . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Arcadia " earned a Nielsen household rating of 10 @.@ 5 , being watched by 17 @.@ 91 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received mostly positive critical reception , with many reviewers praising the episode 's humor . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , several disappearances at an idyllic planned community lead Mulder and Scully to go undercover as a married couple . They find that the members of the community strictly abide by every single subdivision rule , no matter how inconsequential a rule may seem . What Mulder and Scully soon discover is that the ruler of this small community has enforced his rule with a Tulpa creature from Tibet . 
 Arkin , a first @-@ year staff writer for the show , was inspired to write the episode based on an incident in his life that involved a planned community . The episode heavily utilized special effects , with various make @-@ up and digital effects inserted into the final film to give the episode an appropriate feel . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At the Falls of Arcadia , a fictional planned community in San Diego County , California , disgruntled homeowner Dave Kline arrives at home to find a package from an unknown person . The package contains a tacky <unk> , which Kline puts on his roof to annoy the neighbors . While in bed that night , Kline hears an intruder in the house . He goes to investigate while his wife , Nancy , stays in bed . A mysterious creature attacks and kills the Klines . 
 Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) investigate the Klines ' disappearance , going undercover as new homeowners under the aliases Rob and Laura Petrie . As Mulder and Scully are moving into the Klines ' former home , neighbor Win Shroeder nervously tucks away Mulder 's basketball hoop into the garage , telling him that it is against the community 's CC & Rs . Settling in , the agents begin searching the house and find what appears to be blood on a blade of the ceiling fan . When Big Mike , another neighbor , wants to let the " Petries " in on the " consequences " of breaking the community rules , homeowner association president Gene Gogolak describes him as " a weak link " to be dealt with . That night , the creature seemingly kills him . While taking a walk , Scully later finds the Schroeder 's dog <unk> and Big Mike 's necklace in a storm drain . <unk> 's face is covered in a substance that looks like blood . 
 Mulder and Scully discuss possible motives for the Klines ' presumed murders , and Scully decides to have the substances analyzed in San Diego . Mulder decides to test his theories that noncompliance with the community rules is the motive by sticking a plastic flamingo in the yard , among other antics . Mulder later finds a note in his mailbox that says , " Be like the others ... before it gets dark " After dark , Mulder brings out his basketball hoop , and Shroeder runs over to frantically argue with Mulder to put it away . Meanwhile , something comes out of the grass at Mrs. Shroeder , who screams . Mulder chases it away , but they all notice their light has burned out . 
 Shroeder confronts Gogolak , accusing him of trying to kill his family . Instead Schroeder is told " Rob Petrie " is the real problem . Meanwhile , Mulder believes the creature that kills the homeowners moves through the yard , under the grass . Scully shares her lab results : the " blood " on the ceiling fan and on the dog is actually grime , as the neighborhood is built on top of an old landfill . Mulder believes the Klines were buried in their yard , so the next day he gets a backhoe to dig up the front yard , telling the neighbors he 's putting in a reflecting pool , which is not against the community rules . They don 't find the Klines , but they do find the tacky windmill that had been mysteriously delivered to the Klines before they died . The windmill bears a label from Gogolak 's company . 
 As Scully calls for a forensic team to come out there immediately , she hears something in the house . She goes for her gun in the dresser drawer , but finds it missing . As the creature comes up the stairs , a bloodied Big Mike grabs Scully and tells her to get out , that " it 's coming " for her . He shoves Scully in the closet , and fights with the creature . Meanwhile , Mulder confronts Gogolak about marking the Klines for death by giving them the tacky windmill . Mulder says the creature is a Tulpa , a Tibetan <unk> , that Gogolak conjured to assure compliance with the <unk> rules . Mulder arrests him , handcuffs him to a mailbox , and goes to find Scully . Cuffed to the mailbox , Gogolak begs for help , knowing the creature is coming . The creature attacks Gogolak and , as he dies , it disintegrates into dirt . Scully comes outside too late to see the creature , the remnants of which are at Mulder 's feet .

 Daniel Arkin , a first @-@ year staff writer for the show , was inspired to write the episode based on an incident in his life . In 1991 , Arkin had moved into a co @-@ op apartment in Greenwich Village . His movers showed up late , so the crew began unloading around 4 o 'clock in the evening . Because he had not read the co @-@ ops " three hundred page " -long CC and Rs , Arkin was later fined one thousand dollars for moving in after 5 . In the subsequent years , many of Arkin 's friends moved from homes and apartments into co @-@ ops , a situation he describes as " kind of frightening . " 
 The story went through many variations . Originally , Arkin wanted to have the main antagonist be some sort of notorious individual that was terrorizing the neighbor and becoming a sort of metaphorical " bogeyman . " Series creator , Chris Carter convinced Arkin to re @-@ write his story and replace the human with an actual monster . Arkin quickly re @-@ wrote his story , and included elements of the Tulpa myth to create a literal monster . The idea to " marry " Mulder and Scully came from a writers meeting . Everyone thought " Arcadia " would be a good story to allow Mulder and Scully to go undercover .

Millikan later explained , " there was a small window — he had a few days off — and we were able to squeeze him in there . " 
 Cheri Montesanto @-@ Medcalf , the make @-@ up department head for The X @-@ Files , was responsible for making Benrubi appear mauled and bloody . It took four hours to get all of his make @-@ up on him , which included prosthetic appliances and a " head @-@ to @-@ toe " application of dirt and a thickening agent , giving him a " cracked and crusty " appearance . Benrubi wore the make @-@ up for almost twelve hours straight . Costume designer Christine Peters was tasked with designing the outfits for Mulder and Scully . Mulder 's outfit was composed largely of " Lacoste Izod alligator shirts , Dockers , Bass <unk> , " and Scully 's outfit was " jeans and a sweatshirt [ or ] <unk> and sneakers . " Peters noted that Scully 's outfit was harder to design because Scully 's character has " a ' look ' that she doesn 't want to give up . "

 When it came down to making the monster ( The <unk> ) , the staffers were torn . Bruce Carter , the assistant director , explained that the two choices were either to make the creature that had created itself through Gene Gogolak 's personality , or make a more conventional garbage creature covered in " banana peels and coffee grounds . " Makeup supervisor John Vulich eventually came up with a design for the monster that was , effectively , a foam suit . The suit was made out of urethane to give it a bubbly appearance . <unk> rubber was then attached to the suit and it was submerged in " gunk " to create the garbage effect . As the film was eventually edited , however , more and more of the monster was cut , until it became more of an " unseen " menace . Various X @-@ Files staffers later gave the character a variety of nicknames , including " Gumby on Steroids , " " Mr. Butterworth , " " Fecal Fred , " and " The Shit Monster . " 
 Digital effects supervisor Bill Millar was asked to edit Scully 's " evidence video " the Friday before the episode aired . He explained that " they wanted Scully 's point of view rather than the <unk> 's point of view . " Fortunately , the camera was in the trunk of the video playback operator 's car , which was parked near Millar 's editing facility , giving Millar time to edit . The complete special effect sequence took roughly six hours to complete .

 = = = Reviews = = = 
 " Arcadia " received mostly positive reviews from critics . Rob Bricken from Topless Robot named " Arcadia " the tenth funniest X @-@ Files episode and noted the two levels of humor in the episode — the " blatantly hilarious " pairing of Mulder and Scully as husband and wife , and the " perfect parody " of the planned community way of life . Timothy Sexton from Yahoo ! News named " The Arcadia Garbage Monster " as one of " The Best X @-@ Files Monsters of the Week " . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode four stars out of five and noted that the inherent draw of the episode was " seeing Mulder and Scully go under @-@ cover as a yuppie married couple . " Despite the general praise for the episode , however , the two slightly criticized the ending , calling the final scene " rushed . " 
 Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " B + " and called it " a solid example of the show ’ s mid @-@ period form " . However , he noted that the episode is not one of the series bests , unlike the way many fans portray it — due largely to the fact that " it allows us to see what it would be like if Mulder and Scully were a happily married couple " — and that " the episode ’ s monster is a little hard to figure out " . Other reviews were more mixed . Tom Kessenich , in his book Examination : An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6 – 9 of the X @-@ Files gave the episode a more mixed review , writing " after watching ' Arcadia ' , I feel like I just had a couple slices of pizza for dinner on Thanksgiving . Not bad , but hardly the feast I have come to expect . " Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four . Vitaris , despite praising David Duchovny 's performance during the scenes wherein he " rebels against the rules " , called the episode 's main villains " stereotypes of self @-@ indulgent , insulated suburbanites .

 In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon , containing fan @-@ selected episodes , " Arcadia " was presented as the " Best Mulder / Scully Chemistry " . 
 = SS Tubantia = 
 SS Tubantia was an ocean liner for Royal Holland Lloyd ( Dutch : Koninklijke Hollandsche Lloyd ) built in 1913 by Alexander Stephen and Sons of Glasgow . She was built as a fast mail and passenger steamer for service between the Netherlands and South America . Tubantia was a sister ship of <unk> , also of Royal Holland Lloyd . 
 Tubantia was torpedoed and sunk by German submarine UB @-@ 13 on 16 March 1916 . As a vessel of the neutral Netherlands , her sinking caused great fury amongst the Dutch public . The Germans initially claimed that Tubantia must have been sunk by a mine or a British torpedo , but when fragments of a German torpedo were found in one of Tubantia 's lifeboats , the Germans claimed that UB @-@ 13 had fired the torpedo on 6 March at a British warship but it had remained active until hitting Tubantia ten days later . To redirect Dutch anger over Tubantia 's sinking , Germany spread rumors of an impending British invasion of the Netherlands , which one author called a " propaganda coup " . 
 Germany initially offered a settlement of £ 300 @,@ 000 — the ship 's original cost — to Royal Holland Lloyd , but was rejected . In 1922 , an international arbitration committee awarded the company £ 830 @,@ 000 compensation from Germany for the loss of the ship . 
 This was followed by an attempt to recover a fortune in gold coins from the wreck , which was the subject of a landmark court case , but the salvage operation was unsuccessful . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Tubantia was ordered by Royal Holland Lloyd from the Scottish shipbuilding firm Alexander Stephen and Sons of Glasgow . The 13 @,@ 911 GRT ship was about 560 feet ( 170 m ) long ( overall ) and 66 feet ( 20 m ) abeam . She was powered by twin quadruple @-@ expansion steam engines powered by three double @-@ ended and six single @-@ ended boilers . Her top speed of 17 @.@ 5 knots ( 32 @.@ 4 km / h ) exceeded the design requirements . 
 Built at a cost of about £ 300 @,@ 000 , Tubantia was , according to author Nigel Pickford , one of the most luxurious passenger ships of the era . Royal Holland Lloyd made extensive use of electricity throughout Tubantia , powering everything from fans and ventilation , to laundry equipment , to cigar lighters for passengers . The ship also boasted her name spelled out in lights , suspended between the two funnels . Tubantia could accommodate up to 1 @,@ 520 passengers : 250 first @-@ class , 230 intermediate @-@ class , 140 special third @-@ class , and 900 third @-@ class passengers . The liner was launched on 13 November 1913 , and completed trials in the River Clyde in March 1914 . 
 = = Career = = 
 Upon completion and acceptance by Royal Holland Lloyd , Tubantia was used in service between Amsterdam and Buenos Aires . At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Tubantia was returning from South America with £ 500 @,@ 000 in gold destined for banks in London , a large portion of which was intended for the German Bank of London . She was also carrying about 150 German reservists in steerage and a cargo of grain destined for Germany . After making an intermediate stop in Vigo , Spain , Tubantia was stopped and boarded by an officer and crewmen from the Royal Navy cruiser Highflyer , and escorted into port at Plymouth . There , the German reservists were taken off Tubantia by Royal Marines ; the gold was confiscated and removed from the ship . Although news accounts do not report when it occurred , Tubantia was released from Plymouth and allowed to resume her Royal Holland Lloyd service . 
 On 18 October , The New York Times carried a report that indicated Tubantia had run aground on the coast of Kent the previous day . According to the report , Tubantia was returning from Buenos Aires and suffered the accident while heading for Rotterdam with a large number of passengers . Although the article also reported that aid had been summoned from Dover , there was no indication of the extent of damage , if any , to Tubantia . 
 In December 1915 , Tubantia again made news when the Overseas News Agency in Berlin released a report saying that the British had seized all South America mail and parcels from the ship . After the United States expressed concerns about related seizures from two other Dutch ships in service to the United States — Nieuw Amsterdam and Rijndam — the British Foreign Office issued a statement that reported that contraband intended for Germany — which included four packages of rubber , and seven containers of wool — had been found among Tubantia 's mail . 
 = = Sinking = = 
 Tubantia began her regularly scheduled voyage from Amsterdam to Buenos Aires on 15 March 1916 nearly empty of passengers , despite Royal Holland Lloyd advertisements that boasted of " submarine signalling apparatus " on their passenger ships . After sailing to a position about 4 nautical miles ( 7 @.@ 4 km ) from the North Hinder Lightship , about 50 nautical miles ( 93 km ) off the Dutch coast , Tubantia anchored at about 02 : 00 on 16 March to wait for daylight and avoid any chance of misidentification or attack . To that end , the ship was completely illuminated . 
 At about 02 : 30 , crewmen aboard Tubantia spotted a stream of bubbles rapidly approaching the ship 's starboard side , followed by an explosion . The ship quickly began sinking . Distress calls sent out by Tubantia were answered by three ships , Breda , <unk> , and La <unk> , which between them rescued all 80 passengers and all 294 members of the crew . The ship and her cargo were a total loss . Tubantia was the largest neutral vessel sunk during the entire war . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 A war in the British and German press erupted , with vigorous attempts to blame the British by the Germans , and angry rebuttals by the British . Both sides had in mind the egregious violation of Dutch neutrality . The German press first proffered the explanation that Tubantia must have been sunk by a British mine . The British reported that the liner had been sunk by a German torpedo ; the German press countered by saying that if it were a torpedo that sank the ship , it had to have been a British one . The matter was seemingly settled when a stray lifeboat of Tubantia 's was examined and torpedo fragments made of bronze were found embedded in it ; Germany was the only country that used bronze in its torpedoes . 
 Presented with evidence that it was torpedo no . 2033 which had been assigned to the small , coastal submarine UB @-@ 13 , the Germans presented a forged log from UB @-@ 13 that showed her nowhere near Tubantia at the time of the attack . Further , they reported , UB @-@ 13 had fired that specific torpedo at a British warship on 6 March , ten days before Tubantia was sunk . The U.S. Minister to the Netherlands , Henry van Dyke , writing in Fighting for Peace in 1917 , called this explanation " amazing " and derided it : 
 This certain U @-@ boat had fired this particular torpedo at a British war @-@ vessel somewhere in the North Sea ten days before the Tubantia was sunk . The shot missed its mark . But the naughty undisciplined little torpedo went cruising around in the sea on its own hook for ten days waiting for a chance to kill somebody . Then the Tubantia came along and the wandering @-@ Willy torpedo promptly , obstinately , ran into the ship and sank her . This was the explanation . Germany was not to blame . 
 The Dutch public was furious at what they believed a hostile German act . To help divert the public anger against his country , German diplomat Richard von <unk> began a coordinated campaign to spread rumors of an impending British invasion of the Netherlands . Author Hubert van <unk> van <unk> called the German plan a " propaganda coup " , and reports in his book The Netherlands and World War I that the rumors caused some panic in the streets and forced the government to declare a four @-@ day emergency from 30 March to 2 April . 
 Despite denials and rumor @-@ spreading , Germany nevertheless offered compensation in the amount of £ 300 @,@ 000 , Tubantia 's original cost . Rejected by the Dutch , the two countries agreed to have the issue arbitrated after the end of the war . The dispute was finally settled in 1922 , when compensation in the amount of £ 830 @,@ 000 was awarded to Royal Holland Lloyd .

 In 1924 the wreck was the subject of a salvage dispute between two sets of salvors , both seeking to recover a reputed £ 2 million worth of gold coins from it ( £ 100 million in 2012 prices ) .

The winning party , war hero Sydney Vincent <unk> , spent three years and £ 100 @,@ 000 trying to access the gold , but abandoned the attempt after concluding that it was too dangerous for divers to recover it . 
 = Windy Nook = 
 Windy Nook is a village in Tyne and Wear , England , bordered by Carr Hill to the west , Leam Lane Estate to the east , Felling to the north and Sheriff Hill to the south . It lies on steep , sloping land 2 @.@ 25 miles ( 3 @.@ 62 km ) south of Gateshead , 2 @.@ 75 miles ( 4 @.@ 43 km ) south of Newcastle upon Tyne and 12 miles ( 19 km ) north of Durham . In 2011 , the Windy Nook and Whitehills ward had a population of 9 @,@ 781 . Formerly part of Heworth , it was incorporated into the newly formed Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead on 1 April 1974 . 
 Windy Nook has a long industrial history , with evidence of milling and pottery in the area . The principal industry , however , was stone quarrying , and the initial settlement grew as this industry flourished . By the turn of the 20th century , several quarries operated in Windy Nook and the largest , Kell 's Quarry , provided the sandstone and grindstone used to build St Alban 's Church , a Grade II listed building and principal landmark in the village , which was consecrated on 25 August 1842 . 
 The decline in industry in the 20th century saw the population fall to pre @-@ industrial levels . Though today an urban suburb , there are no large commercial areas and the new Tesco store is the largest employer . There remains large areas of green space , however , and it is a popular and high @-@ demand place to live . Residents compare favourably with others in the borough in terms of income , employment levels and educational qualifications . 
 Windy Nook Nature Reserve is a protected wildlife area , as well as one of the largest environmental sculptures in Europe . Mary Elizabeth Wilson , a serial killer , was known as The Merry Widow of Windy Nook . Joseph Hopper , founder of the aged mineworkers scheme , and John Oxberry , a prominent historian , also hailed from the village . 
 = = History = = 
 The name Windy Nook derives from " the lofty and exposed nature of the situation it occupies " . In 1784 , Richard Kell began quarrying at Heworth Shore . His business expanded quickly and , by the turn of the 19th century , Kell and his family had established a second quarry at Windy Nook which was known as Kell 's Quarry . This , along with a number of pre @-@ existing , smaller quarries , provided work for the early settlers and by 1820 there existed a " modern but populous village " . The quarries of Windy Nook became renowned , described as equally important to the more vaunted quarries of Yorkshire and producing sandstone and ' Newcastle grindstone ' of sufficient quality that stones from Kell 's Quarry were used to build St Alban 's Church and other local buildings . 
 As the quarries prospered , the village continued to grow . In 1834 an account described Windy Nook as " a populous hamlet ... chiefly inhabited by workmen employed in the adjoining quarries . Here are three public houses , one farmstead , a corn @-@ mill and several mechanics " . In 1842 , a National school was built by subscription , and within six years the building of two more mills and a pottery saw the population increase to around 2 @,@ 009 inhabitants . The quarries continued to produce high quality grindstone ; in 1860 stone from Kell 's Quarry was used to build the Exchange Building in Newcastle upon Tyne . 
 In spite of this industrialisation , residents were still able to enjoy " wildly romantic scenery " . Ordnance survey maps of 1862 show that Windy Nook remained isolated from the neighbouring villages at Carr Hill and Sheriff Hill . The principal road , Windy Nook Road , had been established and at the junction between this road and Carr Hill Road , the church of St Alban and the national school are evidenced among a cluster of residential dwellings but there was little else save the quarries which dominated during those formative years . By 1870 there were 430 houses for 2 @,@ 653 inhabitants which by 1887 had increased again to 3 @,@ 554 . 
 However , by the turn of the 20th century , the quarries slowly fell into disuse and by the 1960s all of the remaining industrial areas had closed and the quarries infilled , though the sandstone properties at St Alban 's Place and Co @-@ Operative Terrace stand as a reminder to Windy Nook 's industrial history . The decrease in employment opportunities led to a steady decline in population and although some housing developed along Stone Street and Coldwell Lane , the urban sprawl that enveloped most of the outlying settlements of Gateshead during the early 20th century never reached Windy Nook , so that in 1945 it remained largely unchanged in location and size . Despite some terraced housing being built in at Crossfield Park and <unk> Gardens in the 1970 – 80 's , the character of the suburb today remains suburban ; the land is split 50 / 50 between residential properties and open green space and only 11 @.@ 3 % of the residential properties today are council housing . The result is that Windy Nook is a high @-@ demand area for privately owned and social housing . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The decline of heavy industry in the 20th century left Windy Nook with no major employer and there was little in terms of economic activity . There is no major commercial area and residents usually travel to neighbouring Felling town centre to shop or use the small shopping area at the junction of Windy Nook Road and Carr Hill Road / Albion Street . However , in November 2011 , planning permission was approved for conversion of the Black House Inn at the junction of Carr Hill Road and Coldwell lane into a ' Tesco Extra ' store . The approval was granted in spite of complaints and concerns as to noise and traffic being raised by local residents . This store is now the largest employer in Windy Nook , employing around 20 staff . 
 Overall , Windy Nook is wholly outside the lowest 20 % of residents in terms of income in Gateshead . The unemployment rate in the Windy Nook and Whitehills Ward measured by those who claim Jobseeker 's Allowance is 5 % , which is the same as the overall Gateshead average , whilst youth unemployment is 10 % . The average income of residents in the ward is £ 23 @,@ 000 per annum . Some 4 @.@ 4 % of residents are self @-@ employed , which compares with a 4 @.@ 5 % borough average .

 At latitude 54 @.@ 938 ° N and longitude 1 @.@ <unk> ° W , Windy Nook lies 2 @.@ 25 miles ( 3 @.@ 62 km ) south @-@ east of Gateshead and 255 miles ( 410 km ) from London . It sits on a bed of coal , freestone and sandstone known locally as the " Grindstone Post " and occupies an elevated position with a steep slope running from north to south to a maximum natural height of 160 metres ( 520 ft ) above sea @-@ level . This distinctive , steep topography provides residents with " fantastic " views ; especially to the north and in some places panoramic views across the Team Valley in the west and towards the North Sea in the east . Around 50 % of the land is green space ; a combination of urban green space , natural fields , wildlife corridors and a nature reserve . These combine to improve the quality and feel of the area . 
 Official documents indicate that the boundaries of Windy Nook are Albion Road in the north , Windy Nook Road to the west , Stone Street and the adjoining streets to the south and the Fiddler 's Three public house to the east . Windy Nook was part of County Durham until it was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead by the Local Government Act 1972 . It is now bordered by settlements which are also part of the metropolitan borough . These are Sheriff Hill to the south , Carr Hill to the west , Felling to the north and Leam Lane Estate to the east .

 Windy Nook was initially an ecclesiastical district in the parish of Jarrow , but after the Local Government Act 1972 , it is today wholly within the council ward of Windy Nook and Whitehills in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead and is approximately 2 @.@ 9 square kilometres ( 1 @.@ 1 sq mi ) in area . It is represented by three councillors . In June 2012 , they were Jim Turnbull , Tom Graham and Pat Ronan . 
 Windy Nook is part of the Westminster parliamentary constituency of Gateshead . It was previously in the Gateshead East and Washington West constituency which was abolished by boundary changes before the 2010 UK General Election . For many years the MP was Joyce Quin , who retired on 11 April 2005 and was awarded a life peerage into the House of Lords on 13 June 2006 and is now Baroness Quin . 
 The present MP Ian Mearns , is a member of the Labour party and his office is in Gateshead . He replaced Sharon Hodgson who successfully campaigned in the newly formed constituency of Washington and Sunderland West . In the 2010 UK General Election , Mearns was elected with a majority of 12 @,@ 549 over Frank Hindle . The swing from Labour to the Liberal Democrats was 3 @.@ 9 % .

 Windy Nook Primary school is at Albion Street and caters for students aged between 3 and 11 years . It is a much larger than average @-@ sized school though the number of students eligible for free school means is below average . The standard of provision is declining ; in 2001 the school was named by OFSTED as one of the most successful schools in England but subsequent inspections have seen the school 's rating decline so that in the most recent inspection the school was rated as satisfactory overall , with inconsistent levels of attainment and teaching noted . 
 Windy Nook Primary is the only school in the village . Some children of primary school age attend Colegate Community Primary School , located on the fringe of Windy Nook at Colegate West in neighbouring Leam Lane . This too is a satisfactory school which suffers from inconsistent attainment among pupils . The nearest Roman Catholic school is St Augustine 's Primary ; a good school at Leam Lane Estate . Secondary school provision is at Thomas Hepburn Community Academy on <unk> Road in Felling . This is a satisfactory but improving school where the number of pupils entitled to free school meals is more than twice the national average . 
 Children in Windy Nook achieve better than average results at Key Stages two and three compared to the overall borough average . Approximately 66 % of children leave secondary school with 5 or more A * – C grade GCSEs , which is higher than the national and Gateshead averages ( 59 % and 58 % respectively ) , though overall the total number of residents holding those qualifications is 36 @.@ 5 % .

 Windy Nook has two Grade II listed buildings . 
 The Church of St Alban was designed by Thomas Liddell , the son of a Tory politician , and built between 1841 and 1842 . The completed building cost £ 880 and was consecrated on 25 August 1842 by the Bishop of Durham in attendance with 36 local clergy . Built in locally quarried sandstone and named for the first martyr of the Anglican Church , St Alban 's is a " neat structure in the early English style " with a Welsh slate roof and " satisfactory interior and decoration " . The church was extended in 1888 and is today a Grade II listed building . The gates , gate piers and overthrows , also designed by Liddell and built at the same time as the church , are tall sandstone structures with wrought iron adornments . These are also Grade II listed buildings . 
 In addition , the residential properties at 1 – 10 East View Terrace were locally listed by Gateshead Council as buildings of special interest in 2004 . At the same panel hearing , the committee elected not to list the Ebenezer Chapel , a Methodist chapel at Stone Street . A New Connexion chapel is evidenced in Windy Nook in 1855 though the chapel at Stone Street was opened in 1865 ; one year later than the " beautiful little Gothic church " opened by the Primitive Methodists at Albion Street at a cost of £ 340 . The New Connexion amalgamated with the Primitive Methodists in 1942 and services were held in Ebenezer until 1963 while the Albion Street chapel hosted Sunday School . By 1976 , a new building was erected alongside the old chapel and that new building still stands as the Windy Nook Methodist Church .

 Other venues are the Bay Horse , an older stone building at the corner of East Street and Stone Street , which has a conservatory , catering facilities and large car park . Whilst open for business , the Bay Horse is currently available for long term lease . The Fiddlers Three public house , located at Albion Street , is another older stone building with modern catering facilities . The Black House Inn , evidenced as the Coal Waggon Inn on ordnance survey maps in 1862 at the junction of Carr Hill Road and Co @-@ operative Terrace , was partially demolished in 2011 to make way for a Tesco Extra store .

 'The Windy Nook ' is the title of a local landmark created by sculptor Richard Cole at Whitehill Drive . The sculpture appears at first glance to be an old fortification of interlinked walls and pathways sitting atop Windy Nook Pit Hill ; local children refer to the artwork simply as ' the Fortress ' In fact , the hill is a former slag heap and the ' ruins ' are made from 2 @,@ 500 tons of granite blocks salvaged from the old Scotswood Bridge . It was unveiled in 1986 during Gateshead Sculpture Week . 
 Today , the ' Windy Nook ' is a popular installation much used for walking and recreation and which is some 180 metres ( 590 ft ) in height and covers 5 @,@ 500 square metres ( 59 @,@ 000 sq ft ) in area . It remains one of the largest environmental sculptures in Europe . As it has matured it has become home to various <unk> and animal life and is now considered an ordinary part of the landscape .

 Windy Nook Nature Park was opened in 1981 and is at the north west corner of Windy Nook . It is a collaborative enterprise between local conservation volunteers and Gateshead Council , seeking to turn two hectares of unattractive wasteland into an urban nature park . Many of the trees were planted by local school children and today the reserve is a large open space offering the same panoramic views as most other parts of the area , with acid @-@ heath grassland , scrub woodland and a small spring @-@ fed pond . The reserve is also a Site of Nature Conservation Importance ( SNCI ) . In 2007 , Gateshead Council invested £ 100 @,@ 000 into the reserve from their ' Safer , Stronger Communities Fund ' to make improvements to an area which had become " blighted by misuse " . The money led to the removal of a BMX track within the reserve , the installation of an extensive footpath network , improved access points and gating and the planting of more trees . Woodland thinning has also been undertaken . 
 Recent budget cuts by Gateshead Council have seen the local authority transfer the management of the park to the community , despite a local petition raised in protest . The reserve remains popular with residents ; in May 2012 dozens of volunteers cleared rubbish and engaged in a ' Windy Nook Wildlife Festival ' with face @-@ painting and other traditional activities . Local police continue to make ' targeted patrols ' of the reserve to maintain the downward trend of anti @-@ social behaviour in the area . In November 2012 a ' green gym ' was opened at the reserve . This saw fitness equipment installed in clusters of three and four machines which is available for use by the public free of charge . This is one of only two such outdoor public gyms in Gateshead , the other being opened simultaneously at Saltwell Park .

 Joseph Hopper was a local councillor and Methodist preacher who lived in Windy Nook and was the creator of the ' aged mineworkers home scheme ' in 1898 which provided housing for miners who had retired and were no longer eligible for tenure by dint of their employment . The organisation he created , the Durham Aged Mineworkers Homes Association , is today a registered charity which owns around 1 @,@ 500 properties and had a turnover in 2012 of over six million pounds . A celebration of Hopper 's work was produced after his death by John Oxberry , who was himself born in Windy Nook , in 1924 . Oxberry , born in 1857 , was a renowned local historian who traveled to New Zealand but returned to publish various texts , including Windy Nook Village ; its inhabitants and their Co @-@ operative store , and served a variety of roles on Gateshead Council with sufficient distinction that he was made a Freeman of Gateshead in 1937 . Oxberry died three years later . 
 Arguably the most notable resident , however , is Mary Elizabeth Wilson ; a serial killer who achieved worldwide notoriety as the " Merry Widow of Windy Nook " . Wilson was born in Hebburn but lived with her first husband John Knowles , along with her lover , John Russell in the same house at Windy Nook for 43 years . Knowles died in 1955 and she married Russell five months later . He died two years later and both were attributed to natural causes . Wilson remarried again but her third marriage , to Oliver Leonard , lasted just twelve days and he died leaving £ 50 to his wife in his will . A short time later , Wilson married for a fourth time to Ernest Wilson . At her wedding reception , Wilson joked to a guest that the sandwiches left over could be saved for the funeral . When Ernest died soon after , Wilson joked with the funeral director that she should be offered a trade discount for all of the trade she passed his way . Local residents heard of these comment and began speculating as to the spate of deaths , so that Police eventually exhumed Oliver Leonard and Ernest Wilson in 1958 and found traces of phosphorus caused by rat poison . Despite claiming that sexual stimulation pills were the source of the phosphorus , Wilson was convicted of both murders at Leeds in 1958 and sentenced to hang at Durham ; the last woman to be so sentenced . Due to her age , her execution was commuted to a life sentence , and she died in Holloway prison in 1962 . A later exhumation of her first two husbands also resulted in phosphorus being found , but Wilson died before she could be tried again .

 = L 'Oiseau Blanc = 
 L 'Oiseau Blanc ( commonly known in the English @-@ speaking world as The White Bird ) was a French Levasseur PL.8 biplane that disappeared in 1927 , during an attempt to make the first non @-@ stop transatlantic flight between Paris and New York to compete for the Orteig Prize . The aircraft was flown by French World War I aviation heroes , Charles Nungesser and François Coli . The aircraft disappeared after its 8 May 1927 takeoff from Paris . Two weeks later , Charles Lindbergh successfully made the New York – Paris journey and claimed the prize , flying the Spirit of St. Louis . 
 The disappearance of L 'Oiseau Blanc is considered one of the great mysteries in the history of aviation . Many rumors circulated about the fate of the aircraft and crew , with mainstream opinion at the time being that the aircraft was probably lost in a squall over the Atlantic . Investigations starting in the 1980s suggest that the aircraft probably reached Newfoundland , and may have crashed in Maine . 
 The disappearance of Nungesser and Coli has an extensive legacy , and is referred to in many films and museums . A street in Paris is named after the aviators , and a commemorative postage stamp was issued in 1967 . A statue at the Paris Le Bourget Airport honors the attempted flight , and there is a memorial on the cliffs of Étretat , from where their aircraft was last seen in France . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1919 , New York hotel owner Raymond Orteig offered a USD $ 25 @,@ 000 prize , the Orteig Prize , to the first aviators to make a non @-@ stop transatlantic flight between New York and Paris during the next five years . With no takers , he renewed the offer in 1924 , when aviation technology had advanced enough at that point that many people tried for the prize . Most were attempting to fly from New York to Paris , but a number of French aviators planned an attempt to fly in the opposite direction , from Paris to New York . 
 François Coli , age 45 , a World War I veteran and recipient of the French Legion of Honor , had been making record @-@ breaking flights across and around the Mediterranean , and had been planning a transatlantic flight since 1923 . His original plans were to fly with his wartime comrade Paul Tarascon , a flying ace with 12 victories from the war . They became interested in the Orteig Prize in 1925 , but in late 1926 an accident destroyed their Potez 25 biplane . Tarascon was badly burned , and relinquished his place as pilot to 35 @-@ year @-@ old Charles Nungesser , a highly experienced flying ace with over 40 victories , third highest among the French . 
 Nungesser had been planning an independent attempt at a solo crossing to win the Orteig Prize , but initial discussions with designer Pierre Levasseur had led to the company owner insisting that Coli be considered as his navigator in a new two @-@ place variant of the production Levasseur <unk> 
 = = Design and development = = 
 At the Pierre Levasseur Company in Paris , Nungesser and Coli , working closely with Chief Engineer Émile <unk> and production manager Albert <unk> , assisted in the design of the new Levasseur PL.8 biplane . Based on the Levasseur <unk> developed for the Aéronavale to operate from the French aircraft carrier Béarn , the PL.8 was a conventional , single @-@ bay , wood and fabric @-@ covered biplane that carried a crew of two in a side @-@ by @-@ side , open cockpit . 
 Major modifications included the reinforcement of the plywood fuselage , and removing two of the forward cockpits so the main cockpit could be widened to allow Nungesser and Coli to sit side @-@ by @-@ side . The wingspan was also increased to approximately 15 m ( 49 ft ) . Two additional fuel tanks were mounted aft of the firewall , meaning the PL.8 's three fuel tanks held a total of 4 @,@ 025 l ( 1 @,@ 063 US gal ) of gasoline . 
 The PL.8 also incorporated several safety features in case of ditching at sea . Apart from small floats attached directly to the undersides of the lower wing , the main units of the fixed , tailskid undercarriage could be jettisoned on takeoff , in order to reduce the aircraft 's weight . The underside of the fuselage was given a boat @-@ like shape and made watertight for a water landing . Nungesser and Coli 's plan was to make a water landing in New York , in front of the Statue of Liberty . 
 A single W @-@ 12 Lorraine @-@ Dietrich 340 kilowatts ( 460 hp ) engine was used , with the cylinders set in three banks spaced 60 ° apart from one another , similar to the arrangement used in Napier engines . The engine was tested to ensure it would last the entire flight , and was run for over 40 hours while still in the Parisian factory . 
 The aircraft , christened L 'Oiseau Blanc , was painted white , and had the French tricolor markings , with Nungesser 's personal World War I flying ace logo : a skull and crossbones , candles and a coffin , on a black heart , painted on the fuselage . The biplane carried no radio and relied only on celestial navigation , a specialty of Coli from his previous flights around the Mediterranean . 
 In 1928 , a second PL @-@ 8 , and equipped with a Hispano @-@ Suiza 12M , 375 kW ( 500 hp ) engine , was built . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 In April 1927 , the PL.8 @-@ 01 was shipped from the factory for Nungesser to begin a series of proving tests to determine aircraft performance . Most of the flights were conducted around Villacoublay and Chartres . Although full fuel loads were never carried , during one flight , he reached a speed of 207 kilometres per hour ( 129 mph ) and flight elevation of 4 @,@ 900 m ( 16 @,@ 100 ft ) . 
 The evaluations proceeded successfully through the flight envelope without major changes required to the basic design . The only incident of note was a fire that broke out in the hangar where the PL.8 @-@ 01 had been stored . Scorched fabric on the top wing was the result with effective repairs carried out shortly after . On 7 May 1927 , after the tests were complete , the aircraft was prepared for its record flight , flying from Villacoublay to Le Bourget Field . 
 = = = Transatlantic flight = = = 
 Nungesser and Coli took off at 5 : 17 a.m. , 8 May 1927 from Le Bourget Field in Paris , heading for New York . Their PL.8 @-@ 01 weighed 5 @,@ 000 kg ( 11 @,@ 000 lb ) on takeoff , extremely heavy for a single @-@ engined aircraft , barely clearing a line of trees at the end of the field . Gathering an escort of French fighter aircraft , Nungesser and Coli turned back as planned , and at low altitude , immediately jettisoned the main undercarriage . 
 The intended flight path was a great circle route , which would have taken them across the English Channel , over the southwestern part of England and Ireland , across the Atlantic to Newfoundland , then south over Nova Scotia , to Boston , and finally to a water landing in New York . 
 Once in the air , the biplane was escorted to the French coast by four military aircraft led by French Air Force Captain <unk> , and sighted from the coastal town of Étretat . A sighting was made by the commanding officer of the British submarine HMS <unk> , who recorded the note in his log , that he observed a biplane at 300 m altitude , 20 nautical miles southwest of the tip of Needles on the Isle of Wight . In Ireland , an aircraft overhead was reported by a resident of the town of Dungarvan and a Catholic priest reported a sighting over the village of <unk> , then no further verified reports were made . 
 Crowds of people gathered in New York to witness the historic arrival , with tens of thousands of people crowding Battery Park in Manhattan to have a good view of the Statue of Liberty , where the aircraft was scheduled to touch down . Rumors circulated that L 'Oiseau Blanc had been sighted along its route , in Newfoundland , or over Long Island . In France , some newspapers even reported that Nungesser and Coli had arrived safely in New York , evoking a wave of French patriotism . L 'Oiseau Blanc had been carrying a sizable load of fuel , 4 @,@ 000 litres ( 1 @,@ 056 @.@ 7 US gal ) , which would have given them approximately 42 hours of flight time . After this time had passed , with no word as to the aircraft 's fate , it was realized that the aircraft had been lost . In France , the public was scandalized by the newspapers such as La Presse which had printed false reports about the aircraft 's arrival , and outrage was generated against the companies involved , with demonstrations in the streets . 
 In the immediate aftermath of their disappearance , an international search was launched to find Nungesser and Coli . Aviation Digest sponsored a well @-@ known pilot , Floyd Bennett to search the area between New York and Newfoundland for nine days . The Canadian government search and rescue organizations also sent out two search aircraft ( one of which crashed ) . Searchers including the French Navy , the U.S. Navy , and the Royal Canadian Navy that scoured the route , including Labrador , the northeast coast of the U.S. and the area around the St. Lawrence River . Subsequently , with no sign of the aircraft , further search efforts were abandoned . 
 Twelve days after Nungesser and Coli 's departure , Charles Lindbergh , flying solo in the Spirit of Saint Louis , took off from New York on his own famous journey . After a flight of 33 hours , 30 minutes , he received a hero 's welcome when he arrived in Paris , even as the French mourned the loss of Nungesser and Coli .

 The mainstream view was that L 'Oiseau Blanc crashed over the Atlantic due to a squall . Nonetheless , 12 witnesses in Newfoundland and Maine claimed to have heard the aircraft as it passed overhead . Residents at Harbor Grace , Newfoundland reported sighting a white aircraft circling in haze or fog , late on 9 May 1927 . With no aircraft on the island and no overflights taking place , the local newspapers highlighted a " mystery " aircraft . If these stories were true , they would have meant that the flight was far behind schedule , as they would have been in the 40th hour of flight . This delay may have been explained , however , by the fact that the aircraft was flying against the prevailing weather pattern . Fishermen off the coast of Newfoundland reported that the weather had turned cold and foul , which might have caused the delay . In May 1927 the US Coast Guard found an airplane wing in <unk> Bay at Fort Pond Bay Long Island Sound ; reportedly aircraft wreckage was seen in August 1927 , 200 miles off the New York Coast . 
 Many rumors swirled around the aircraft 's disappearance , including a theory that was proposed that the aviators had been shot down by rum @-@ runners with tommy guns , as well as the belief that Nungesser and Coli were still alive and living with Indians in Canada . In 1930 , claims circulated that L 'Oiseau Blanc 's engine had been located in Maine , but nothing was confirmed . Later stories emerged in 1948 , from reports that caribou hunters and fur trappers had found aircraft wreckage in Great Gull Pond . 
 A fresh round of interest in L 'Oiseau Blanc began in the 1980s , after freelance writer Gunnar Hansen of Northeast Harbor , Maine , researched and published an article in the June 1980 issue of Yankee Magazine , titled " The Unfinished Flight of the White Bird " . Hansen revealed how Anson Berry ( d . 1936 ) , a hermit living near Machias , Maine , claimed late in the afternoon of May 9 , 1927 to have heard a sputtering aircraft fly over his isolated camp at Round Lake , Maine . Berry had not been able to see the aircraft because of fog and low clouds , but had heard what sounded like a crash or forced landing in the distance . Hansen and others did a great deal of research during the 1980s , and located multiple other witnesses who reported memories of the aircraft in a line from Nova Scotia down to eastern Maine on that date . 
 In 1984 , the French government made an official investigation , concluding that it was possible that the aircraft had reached Newfoundland . In 1989 , the NBC television series Unsolved Mysteries advanced the theory that the two aviators made it across the ocean , but crashed and perished in the woods of Maine . One of Nungesser 's relatives , William Nungesser , made several trips to Maine to search , focusing his energies around the north slope of Round Lake Hills in Washington County , Maine , as well as the area around Lake Winnipesaukee . 
 Famed author Clive Cussler and his NUMA organization also attempted to solve the mystery , searching for the aircraft in Maine and in Newfoundland . They made multiple visits in the 1980s , and interviewed dozens of elderly witnesses : hunters , fishermen and others who said they had seen or heard the aircraft pass by in 1927 . The NUMA expedition was named " Midnight Ghost " , after Lindbergh 's quote in his book The Spirit of St. Louis , where he said that Nungesser and Coli had " vanished like midnight ghosts " . In 1992 , divers traveled to Newfoundland and attempted to locate and search Great Gull Pond for a wreck , but found nothing , and were not even sure that they had located the right lake . Other lakes were also searched , from Machias , Maine , to Chesterfield , Maine . 
 Certain pieces were found which , though not conclusive , did suggest that L 'Oiseau Blanc had made it to the continent . Little of the aircraft would have remained , since it was created primarily from plywood and canvas . The parts most likely to endure would have been the engine and the aluminum fuel tanks . In Maine , bits and pieces of struts were found , and wood similar to the kind used to build the biplane . Engine metal was also found near the town of Machias , that was not typical to the United States or Canada . Two local residents described a large metal object , a " really big motor " which had been dragged out of the woods for salvage , along a path allegedly made by a logging operation . 
 In 2011 , the Wall Street Journal reported that an unofficial French team was focusing on theories that the aircraft crashed off the coast of Canada after flying over Newfoundland .

 The disappearance of L 'Oiseau Blanc has been called " the Everest of aviation mysteries " . <unk> , The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery , has called the aircraft , " History 's Most Important Missing Airplane " . Although it has been claimed that " if the aircraft had successfully completed its journey , Lindbergh would not qualify for the Orteig Prize , the sole reason for his attempt . When Lindbergh did succeed with his own flight across the Atlantic , the international attention on his achievement was probably enhanced because of the disappearance of ' L 'Oiseau Blanc just days earlier . It is also suggested that it was Lindbergh 's historic success which gave a major boost to the American aviation industry , without which the course of America 's military and industrial accomplishments might have been quite different . 
 A monument was erected in Étretat in 1927 , to mark the last place from which the biplane was seen in France , but it was destroyed in 1942 by the occupying German army . A new 24 m ( 79 ft ) high monument , the " Monument Nungesser et Coli " , was erected in 1963 atop one of the cliffs . There is also a nearby museum . 
 Another monument in France was inaugurated on 8 May 1928 , at Le Bourget airport . Honoring Lindbergh , Nungesser , and Coli , it is inscribed , " A ceux qui <unk> et celui qui <unk> " ( trans : " To those who tried and to the one who succeeded " ) . The French issued a commemorative postage stamp in 1967 , 40 years after the flight , to honor Nungesser and Coli 's attempt . A street , " Rue Nungesser et Coli " is named after the aviators , along the Stade Jean <unk> in the 16th arrondissement of Paris . 
 In 1928 , the Ontario Surveyor General named a number of lakes in the northwest of the province to honour aviators who had perished during 1927 , mainly in attempting oceanic flights . Amongst these are Coli Lake ( 51 @.@ 32 ° N 93 @.@ 59 ° W ﻿ / 51 @.@ 32 ; <unk> ) and Nungesser Lake ( 51 @.@ 49 ° N 93 @.@ 52 ° W ﻿ / 51 @.@ 49 ; <unk> ) . 
 The fate of L 'Oiseau Blanc is occasionally mentioned in films . The 1999 made @-@ for @-@ TV Canadian film Restless Spirits , a children 's film with the alternate title Dead Aviators , uses the mystery of Nungesser and Coli 's disappearance as the key plot device . A young girl , who struggles with her pilot father 's death in an aircraft crash years before , visits her grandmother in Newfoundland . While there , she encounters the ghosts of Nungesser and Coli , whose restless spirits constantly relive their own unheralded 1927 crash in a nearby pond . The girl decides to help the pair move on to the afterlife by assisting them in rebuilding their aircraft and completing their flight so they may be released and , by doing so , works through her own emotional distress over her father 's test flight death . And in the opening montage of the 2005 film Sahara , based on Cussler 's novel , a French newspaper article is displayed reporting a fictional story of NUMA finding the aircraft . 
 As of 2008 , the landing gear is the only confirmed part of the biplane remaining , and is on display at the Musée de l 'Air et de l <unk> ( French Air and Space Museum ) , in Le Bourget airport in Paris , the location from which L 'Oiseau Blanc took off .

 = Operation Freshman = 
 Operation Freshman was the codename given to a British airborne operation conducted in November 1942 during World War II . It was the first British airborne operation conducted using gliders , and its target was the Vemork Norsk Hydro chemical plant in Telemark county , Norway which produced heavy water for Nazi Germany . By 1942 the German atomic weapons programme had come close to being able to develop a nuclear reactor , but in order for the reactor to function it would require a great deal of heavy water . The source of the heavy water was the Norsk Hydro plant , which had been occupied in 1940 ; when the British government learned of the German nuclear developments , it was decided that a raid would be launched to destroy the plant and deny the Germans the heavy water required to develop a nuclear weapon . Several tactics were discussed and discarded as impractical , and it was finally decided that a small airborne force composed of sappers from the Royal Engineer units attached to 1st Airborne Division would land by glider a short distance from the plant , demolish it with explosives and then escape over the Norwegian border into Sweden . 
 After a period of extensive training , the airborne force took off in two aircraft – glider combinations on the night of 19 November 1942 . Both managed to reach the Norwegian coast , but neither was able to reach their objective . The first pair suffered from navigational difficulties and severe weather , which resulted in the tow rope snapping and the first glider crash – landing , with its towing aircraft returning to base ; eight airborne troops were killed outright , four were severely injured and five unhurt , with the survivors captured shortly after the crash . The second pair fared even worse , with both aircraft and glider crashing into a mountain for unknown reasons ; the aircrew and a number of airborne troops were killed outright , and those who survived were taken prisoner . None survived for very long , either being poisoned or executed as a result of Adolf Hitler 's Commando Order , which stated all Commando personnel were to be immediately executed upon capture . At the end of the war , a number of Wehrmacht personnel were tried and condemned to death for their part in the executions . 
 = = Background = = 
 The German government began development of an atomic weapons programme in April 1939 when two scientists , Irène and Frédéric Joliot @-@ Curie , declared in an issue of the scientific journal Nature that atomic fission was possible and could produce immense amounts of power . The Joliot @-@ Curies argued that not only did it have possibilities as a power source , it might also be used to create an extremely powerful weapon . By September 1941 the German scientists assigned to the programme had determined how a nuclear reactor could be developed ; this required significant quantities of heavy water to act as a neutron moderator to encase the uranium which would be used to provide the material for a nuclear weapon . Heavy water was extremely scarce and difficult to produce , and Germany only possessed a small amount which had been produced in laboratories . Norway possessed a large amount which was produced by the Vemork Norsk Hydro chemical plant near the village of Rjukan , but the Norwegian government would not sell more than three gallons of heavy water a month , becoming suspicious of the sudden increase in demand for the water by the German government . When Norway was invaded and occupied by Germany in April 1940 , however , this obstruction ended ; the Vemork plant was captured and began producing heavy water for the German atomic weapons programme . Production of heavy water was slowed initially due to the effects of the fighting in Norway and a drought in the area , which led to a lack of water to provide hydroelectric power for the plant . However , once the weather improved and snow began to melt , providing enough water to create sufficient hydroelectric power , production continued . 
 By mid @-@ 1942 it had come to the attention of the British government that the plant had begun to produce large quantities of heavy water and was stockpiling it for later use . The decision was therefore taken that the plant and the stockpiles of heavy water would have to be destroyed in order to impede the German programme . A number of methods for destroying the plant were considered . The first was a mass raid by Royal Air Force ( RAF ) bombers , but this was rejected due to the difficulty in locating the plant during night bombing , the principal bombing tactic used by the RAF at the time , and the heavy casualties that would be inflicted on the local Norwegian population during a night raid . An attack by Norwegian saboteurs was also ruled out , as was landing troops by PBY Catalina flying boat on Lake Møsvatn , 15 miles ( 24 km ) from the target , the latter due to the steepness of the surrounding mountain slopes and the inability of flying boats to land on the frozen water . It was decided that a raid by glider @-@ borne airborne troops would have the greatest chance of success . The area around the plant would be difficult to land on , but a possible landing site for gliders was located near the Møsvatn dam , although it would require considerable skill on the part of the glider pilots in order to land safely . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 = = = Operation Grouse = = = 
 In March 1942 SOE had recruited Einar Skinnarland , a Norwegian engineer who worked at the Møsvatn dam . Skinnarland had successfully sailed to Britain and was parachuted back to Telemark after ten days of intensive training . Having several contacts within Vemork he was able to roughly identify the disposition of German troops and other defences . Additionally SOE decided to send an advance party of Norwegian agents into Telemark , and began intensively training a four @-@ man team over the summer . The party , code @-@ named Operation Grouse , was led by Jens @-@ Anton Poulsson and also included Knut Haugland , Claus Helberg and Arne <unk> . The Norwegians , all people local to the area with exceptional outdoors skills , underwent extra outdoor training in Scotland as well as learning the skills necessary to operate in occupied territory ; including sabotage , radio transmitting and " irregular warfare " . 
 The Grouse team were ready to be inserted by October . Several flights were made but aborted due to bad weather , before the team finally dropped on 18 October . The team landed at <unk> on the Hardangervidda ( a large wilderness avoided by the German forces ) and spent the next 15 days trekking towards Møsvatn , where they made contact with Skinnarland 's brother , Torstein . Once they had established contact with London the party began making preparations for the arrival of the British commandos . A suitable glider landing site was chosen 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) south west of Møsvatn dam and the team reconnoitred the area to help Combined Operations decide the best way to attack the plant . 
 = = = = German defences = = = = 
 The geography of the area around the village and the plant meant that attacking the plant and destroying the existing stocks of heavy water would be extremely difficult . Both were situated in a deep valley which possessed thickly – forested sides that rose almost vertically from a narrow river – bed , and which was overlooked by <unk> , a mountain approximately 5 @,@ 400 feet ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) high ; the plant itself had been built on a broad rock shelf 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) above the river bed . 
 Einar Skinnarland had observed the German defences over the summer and passed the information back to SOE . Later reconnaissance by Torstein <unk> and the Grouse team was also transmitted to London in the weeks leading up to the operation . In early October Generaloberst Nikolaus von <unk> , the commander in chief of the German forces in Norway , had personally visited the plant . While there he warned the local garrison that he believed the plant was a likely target for British commando raids , but crucially he did not have the resources to increase the manpower there . Although Einar Skinnarland had observed a garrison of some 100 men in the village of Rjukan , 20 at the dam and about 55 near the main plant during the summer , by October this had been reduced to about 12 at the plant , 12 at the dam and approximately 40 in Rjukan . Most of the men were elderly or infirm Austrians under the command of an elderly captain , although well trained German regulars periodically passed through Telemark . Skinnarland also believed that Gestapo agents were in the area . 
 The Germans had erected three iron hawsers across the valley to prevent low flying bombing raids but on the ground most of their defences were positioned to prevent an assault from the ridge above the plant , the direction from which they believed an attack was most likely . Minefields and booby traps predominantly protected this side of the plant , but there were also searchlights on the roof and a machine gun nest near the entrance . A single bridge crossed the steep gorge in front of the plant , but was normally only protected by two guards . However , there were some 300 @,@ 000 German troops in Norway at this time and reinforcements could quickly be called into the area , which would complicate the commandos ' escape to the Swedish border . 
 = = = Planning = = = 
 The Headquarters staff of Combined Operations at the War Office was tasked with devising a plan for the glider @-@ borne assault on the plant , as it had been with previous airborne and commando operations , such as Operation Biting . This would be the first British airborne operation ever to use gliders ; all previous operations had been conducted solely with parachutists . The staff decided that although gliders would be the most suitable for the operation due to the heavy loads to be carried by the airborne troops , and the possibility that they could be widely dispersed if they were dropped by parachute , the airborne troops would still be trained for a possible parachute insertion if the landing zone for the gliders was found to be unsuitable . Because of the complicated and technical nature of the operation , which would see the plant rigged with explosives and then detonated , it was believed that a minimum of twelve to sixteen men would be required , and that they would all have to be skilled engineers . The important nature of the operation also led to the force being doubled in order to duplicate it , to ensure that even if half of the force were killed , the survivors would have the necessary skills to complete the operation . The selected troops were volunteer parachutists chosen from the sappers of 9th Field Company ( Airborne ) Royal Engineers and 261st Field Park Company ( Airborne ) Royal Engineers attached to 1st Airborne Division , because the only parachute @-@ trained Royal Engineers unit in existence at the time , 1st Parachute Squadron Royal Engineers , was already deployed in North Africa with 1st Parachute Brigade . Both of the duplicated units that were to participate in the operation were to be commanded by officers from the Royal Engineers ; the first by Lieutenant A.C. Allen and the second by Second @-@ Lieutenant M.D. Green , who was later replaced by Lieutenant D.A. Methven when he was injured during a training accident three days before the operation was to begin . 
 The Royal Air Force unit selected to transport the sappers was 38 Wing , which was commanded by Group Captain T.B. Cooper ; it was provided with a special allotment of three Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers for the operation , which were the only British aircraft in existence at the time which were capable of towing Horsa gliders the distance required and then returning to their base . The SOE agents selected a landing zone for the sappers , which was approximately 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) from the Norsk Hydro plant and could not be observed by German patrols . The plan for the operation called for the sappers to land in the two gliders at the landing zone , guided in by the SOE agents equipped with Eureka radio beacons . Once they had successfully landed , the sappers would be escorted to the plant by the SOE agents , demolish the plant and its stocks of heavy water , and then cross the Norwegian border into neutral Sweden . 
 Combined Operations initially suggested the men should fight their way to the Swedish border , but MI9 believed their chances of survival were better if they attempted to disguise themselves at Norwegians and travel in pairs . In order to facilitate their escape the men were provided with civilian clothes ( to be worn after the operation ) , simple Norwegian phrases ( in the hope no German they encountered would speak Norwegian anyway ) and escape sets containing money and maps . They were also ordered to shave any moustaches and grow their hair long in order to blend in with Norwegian men . 
 = = = Training = = = 
 Training began in early October in Wales and was designed to be extremely arduous , not only to ensure that those who took part would be at the peak of their physical and mental fitness , but also to eliminate any individuals unable to cope with the long marches and difficult terrain that would be encountered during the operation . When this portion of the training had been completed , the sappers were then transferred to the area around Fort William in Scotland , where they were familiarized with a hydroelectric plant similar in design to the one in Norway , and received training on the most efficient way to plant explosives in the Norsk Hydro plant to cause maximum damage . 
 Training also took place at Port Sunlight , where they were shown how to destroy large condensers of the kind found in the plant . The sappers were given detailed briefings on the plant and the surrounding area , and were trained on large models and mock @-@ ups of the buildings that the plant was composed of , all based on information provided by the SOE agents who had arrived earlier in the month . Because the operation was considered to be extremely important , and its results vital to the Allied war effort , security efforts were extremely thorough . A cover story was provided for the sappers as they conducted their training ; a rumour was spread that they were training to compete against a company of American engineers in a fictional ' Washington Cup ' athletic event , which involved a long route march to be completed either by glider or parachute , followed by a complex demolition task and finally a demanding endurance test . The departure airfield was also sealed off to civilians and non @-@ essential military personnel , and all mail and telephone calls were censored . 
 = = Operation = = 
 After their training had been completed , on 17 November the sappers were transported to an RAF airfield at Skitten in Scotland , with the operation scheduled to commence two days later . On the evening of 19 November , Group Captain Cooper , with the aid of a Norwegian meteorologist and regular reports from the SOE agents stationed near the landing zone , decided that although the weather was not perfect , it would be best to launch the operation that night ; Cooper believed that if it were delayed , the weather might deteriorate on subsequent days and prevent the operation from being conducted entirely . The first aircraft – glider combination took off from the airfield at 17 : 50 , with the second following at 18 : 10 ; after circling the airfield several times the two combinations headed out across the North Sea towards their objective . 
 = = = The first combination = = = 
 The first combination flew through poor weather conditions and managed to reach Norway and fly towards its objective ; however during the flight over Norway the Rebecca receiver , which was supposed to pick up the transponder signal from the Eureka beacons being used by the Norwegian SOE agents , developed a mechanical problem and was unable to pick up the signal . This left the aircrew with only map @-@ reading available to locate the landing zone , but the poor weather made this almost impossible . 
 On a second attempt to find the correct area , the combination flew into thick clouds approximately 40 miles ( 64 km ) northwest of Rjukan , and ice began to form on both aircraft and glider , as well as the towing rope connecting the two . At this point the combination began to lose altitude , and the towing rope snapped , setting the glider free ; low on fuel , the aircraft was forced to turn back after signaling to Skitten at 23 : 55 that it had released the glider , and only just succeeded in landing back in Britain . Shortly after releasing the glider , the aircraft broadcast a second message , " Glider in sea " , indicating the air crew 's belief that the glider had crashed . The Royal Navy was asked to begin a search @-@ and @-@ rescue mission , but had no ships in the area ; an aerial search of the area was instead conducted , but did not find the glider . 
 In fact the glider did not land in the sea , but crash @-@ landed in an area called <unk> , overlooking <unk> . Of the seventeen men on board , eight were killed outright , four were severely injured and five unhurt . 
 Thorvald <unk> , a local farmer , found some of the injured soldiers from the glider , but knew no English , and was unable to communicate with them . Nonetheless , <unk> and his neighbor Jonas <unk> decided that they would assist the wounded soldiers , and did not contact the German authorities . After contacting more of the local residents , the soldiers asked for their assistance in escaping to Sweden , but <unk> and others convinced them that this would be impossible , as it would involve traveling across the entirety of Norway . Thus , the Norwegians sheltered and gave medical attention to the injured soldiers , but did not allow any of them to leave . The Norwegians also burned all of the maps and documents from the glider crash before the Germans could arrive , and managed to keep the entire operation secret for almost twenty @-@ four hours . 
 German soldiers , including troops from both the Waffen SS and the Army , arrived the next afternoon on two boats from a nearby camp . They quickly took the British soldiers prisoner , and departed with them on the boats . Despite the grave injuries suffered by some of the soldiers , they were still forced to walk under their own power and ride in the unsheltered boats in the cold . The dead soldiers were dumped in a shallow grave . 
 = = = The second combination = = = 
 The second combination managed to reach the coast of Norway , but fared even worse than the first combination ; because of a turn in the weather , the tow aircraft ( second Halifax ) piloted by Flight Lieutenant Roland Parkinson , RCAF , released the glider at a great height and then crashed into a mountain at <unk> in high winds , rain and hail . All of the aircrew were killed instantly . Workmen in the area heard the plane pass overhead shortly before crashing and alerted the German authorities , who arrived quickly . Finding no survivors , the Germans threw the bodies of the aircrew into a nearby bog and left the area . 
 Released just before the tow aircraft crashed , the second glider spiralled out of control and crash @-@ landed in the mountains between Helleland and <unk> . Seven of the men were killed instantly , and the rest were injured to varying degrees . The survivors were unwilling to leave the seriously wounded and two of the British soldiers left the crash site to search for help . After searching for some time , they arrived in the hamlet of Helleland about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) from where they had crashed , and made contact with one of the local residents , Trond Hovland . The soldiers told Hovland about their injured comrades , and asked if he could help them find a doctor . Hovland agreed to help , but informed them that the nearest doctor lived 9 @.@ 3 miles ( 15 @.@ 0 km ) away , in the town of Egersund . In order to contact him , Hovland would have to use the telephone system , controlled by the German authorities , which would alert them to the presence of the soldiers . Believing that there was no alternative , the soldiers agreed to contact the Germans , expecting that they would be taken as prisoners of war . A party from the Norwegian Labour Service arrived at the crash site shortly afterwards and helped tend to the injured soldiers who burned all of their sensitive documents and materials . A German party arrived about twenty minutes later and the British then submitted without a struggle . After their arrest , the prisoners were taken to the German camp at <unk> near Egersund and shot . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Allies were unaware of the fate of the operation until they intercepted a German communiqué stating that two gliders and one aircraft had been forced down , and the crews engaged and annihilated . On 11 December they received a message from an SOE agent explaining that the second gliders occupants had all been shot . Many of the details about the fate of the two glider combinations were only discovered after the war had ended . 
 None of the soldiers or aircrew who survived the crashes remained alive for very long . Of the soldiers from the first glider , three of the four injured men were tortured by the Gestapo and later killed by a doctor who injected air into their bloodstreams . The fourth injured man was shot in the back of the head the next day . All four bodies were dumped at sea . The five uninjured men were held at Grini concentration camp until 18 January 1943 , when they were taken to nearby woods , blindfolded and executed by the Gestapo . The German Wehrmacht and the Gestapo argued over the fate of the prisoners from the second glider . The Wehrmacht believed they should be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention , but in the end the survivors were interrogated and executed within a few hours of their capture at the German barracks at <unk> . They were taken into nearby woods and shot one by one , each being forced to listen to the man before him being executed . Their bodies were stripped and thrown into an unmarked grave . All of the executions were conducted in accordance with the Commando Order issued by Adolf Hitler in October 1942 , which stated that all Commando troops were to be killed immediately upon capture . The local Norwegian population were unable to prevent the prisoners being executed , but tended the graves of the dead until the end of the war . 
 Although the Allied soldiers believed that they had burnt all of their maps , one from the second glider was missed . When the Germans found it they were able to identify the Vemork plant as the target and increased their defence accordingly . German reprisals started instantly and 200 armed Gestapo agents swept into Rjukan where they arrested 21 Norwegians for questioning , but the members of Operation Grouse slipped away into the wilderness of Hardangervidda . They later contributed to the successful Operation Gunnerside in February 1943 , when a small team of Norwegian SOE agents were parachuted into the area and demolished much of the Vemork heavy water plant . The plant did eventually resume operation , but further bombing raids ensured it produced little heavy water for the German atomic weapons programme . 
 Although the operation had been a failure , it demonstrated the range , flexibility and possibilities of airborne forces and glider operations , and also highlighted equipment failures that were rectified for later operations . This included developing a new version of the Rebecca @-@ Eureka homing device system , the Mk II , which was ready by 1943 and proved to be very successful when used in later airborne operations ; during Operation Market Garden and Operation Varsity , aircraft that used the system reported a 95 % success rate . 
 When 1st Airborne Division arrived in Norway in May 1945 , they were informed of the fate of the prisoners , and cooperated with the Norwegian government to have the fallen men buried with full military honours . The five from the first glider were re @-@ interred at the Commonwealth War Graves plot at Vestre <unk> near Oslo . The second glider 's occupants were reburied at <unk> churchyard in Stavanger and the Halifax aircrew were reburied at Helleland . 
 The head of the Gestapo in Oslo , who had signed the order for the prisoners ' executions , committed suicide several days prior to 1st Airborne Division 's arrival in May 1945 , but several Wehrmacht personnel implicated in the decision to execute the prisoners were put on trial and found guilty ; one was shot and another hanged , whilst a senior Non @-@ Commissioned Officer who had shot a prisoner in the back of the head was extradited to the Soviet Union for alleged abuse conducted against Soviet prisoners . Furthermore , the commander of the German forces in Norway – Generaloberst Nikolaus von <unk> – was also found guilty of two of the Freshman deaths during his war crimes trial . 
 = Assemblies of God USA = 
 The Assemblies of God USA ( AG ) , officially the General Council of the Assemblies of God , is a Pentecostal Christian denomination in the United States founded in 1914 during a meeting of Pentecostal ministers at Hot Springs , Arkansas . It is the U.S. branch of the World Assemblies of God Fellowship , the world 's largest Pentecostal body . With a constituency of over 3 million , the Assemblies of God was the ninth largest denomination in the United States in 2011 . 
 The Assemblies of God holds to a conservative , evangelical and Arminian theology as expressed in the Statement of Fundamental Truths and position papers , which emphasize such core Pentecostal doctrines as the baptism in the Holy Spirit , speaking in tongues , divine healing and the Second Coming of Christ . It defines for itself a fourfold mission to evangelize , worship God , disciple believers , and show compassion . 
 The fellowship 's polity is a hybrid of presbyterian and congregational models . This tension between local independence and national authority is seen in the AG 's historical reluctance to refer to itself as a denomination , preferring the terms fellowship and movement . The national headquarters are in Springfield , Missouri , where the administrative and executive offices and Gospel Publishing House are located . 
 It maintains relationships with other Pentecostal groups at both regional and national levels through the Pentecostal / Charismatic Churches of North America and the Pentecostal World Fellowship . It is also a member of the Wesleyan Holiness Consortium and the National Association of Evangelicals .

 The central beliefs of the Assemblies of God are summarized in its Statement of Fundamental Truths . The following is a summary of these 16 non @-@ negotiable Truths : 
 The Bible is inspired by God and is " the infallible , authoritative rule of faith and conduct " . 
 There is only one true God who exists as a Trinity . 
 Jesus Christ is the Son of God and , as the second person of the Trinity , is God . 
 Man was created good by God but was separated from God through original sin . 
 Salvation " is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ " . 
 There are two ordinances . Believer 's baptism by immersion is a declaration to the world that the believer has died and been raised together with Christ , becoming a new creation . The Lord 's Supper is a symbol expressing the believer 's sharing in the divine nature of Christ , a memorial of Christ 's suffering and death , and a prophecy of Christ 's second coming . 
 Baptism in the Holy Spirit is a separate and subsequent experience following conversion . Spirit baptism brings empowerment to live an overcoming Christian life and to be an effective witness . 
 Speaking in tongues is the initial physical evidence of the baptism in the Holy Spirit . 
 Sanctification is , " ... an act of separation from that which is evil , and of dedication unto God . " It occurs when the believer identifies with , and has faith in , Christ in his death and resurrection . It is not believed to be a " second definite work of grace " ( see Finished Work ) , as in some other Pentecostal denominations , but is understood to be a process in that it requires continual yielding to the Holy Spirit . 
 The Church 's mission is to seek and save all who are lost in sin ; the Church is the Body of Christ and consists of all people who accept Christ , regardless of Christian denomination . 
 Divinely called and <unk> @-@ ordained ministers serve the Church . 
 Divine healing of the sick is provided for in the atonement . 
 The " imminent and blessed hope " of the Church is its rapture preceding the bodily return of Christ to earth . 
 The rapture of the Church will be followed by the visible return of Christ and his reign on earth for a thousand years . 
 There will be a final judgment and eternal damnation for the " wicked dead " . 
 There will be future new heavens and a new earth " wherein dwelleth righteousness " . 
 = = = Core beliefs = = = 
 The AG considers salvation , baptism in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues , divine healing and the Second Coming of Christ to be its four core beliefs . 
 = = = = Salvation = = = = 
 The Statement of Fundamental Truths states , " Man 's only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God " . The Assemblies of God holds the Arminian position on salvation . While it agrees with the Calvinist position that God is sovereign , at the same time , it believes that mankind has free will — free to accept or reject God 's gift of salvation and eternal life . Therefore , the Assemblies of God disapproves of the doctrines of double predestination and the unconditional security of the believer , which holds that once saved it is impossible for a person to be lost . Instead , the Assemblies of God believes that salvation is received and kept by faith , if faith in Christ is lost , then salvation is lost . 
 = = = = Baptism in the Holy Spirit = = = = 
 According to the Statement of Fundamental Truths , " All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek " the baptism in the Spirit . It also states , " This was the normal experience of all in the early Christian Church " . It is a separate experience from and occurs after salvation . This baptism gives to the receiver an " <unk> of power for life and service , the <unk> of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry " . There are four experiences listed in the Fundamental Truths that result from Spirit baptism : " overflowing fullness of the Spirit " , " a deepened reverence for God " , intensified consecration and dedication to God and his work , and " a more active love for Christ , for His Word and for the lost " . In addition , this experience initiates the believer in the use of spiritual gifts . The " initial physical sign " of having received this baptism is " speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance " . 
 Baptism in the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues is a requirement for ministerial licensing and ordination . However , Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues is not a requirement for membership or participation in an Assembly of God church . An increasing minority of pastors has expressed concern that there is a lack of biblical support for the claim that Spirit baptism must always be accompanied with speaking in tongues . This concern corresponds with a decrease in the number of Assembly of God adherents reporting baptism in the Holy Spirit ; according to the AG 's Office of Statistics as of 2003 less than 50 percent of adherents had this experience . These challenges to the AG 's traditional position were noted in a 2007 report by the AG 's Spiritual Life Committee : 
 Yet , the distinctive doctrine that once united us has , in some circles , become a point of contention . We lament the increasing rarity of the gifts of the Spirit in our worship setting . We wonder where , in our busy church schedules , will people have an opportunity to tarry at the altars for a transforming Pentecostal experience ? 
 Despite these challenges , the 53rd General Council in 2009 passed a resolution reaffirming the doctrine of initial physical evidence . 
 = = = = Divine healing = = = = 
 The Assemblies of God understands divine healing to have been provided for in the atonement . Looking to scripture , such as James 5 and Isaiah 53 : 5 , the AG believes that Christians can pray for healing . Indeed , it believes scripture gives elders of the church the responsibility to pray " the prayer of faith " over the sick . It believes God can and does heal , but believes that God is sovereign and that , whether one is healed or not , a person 's trust must be in God . It sees no conflict in trusting God for healing while receiving medical care . Healing testimonies regularly appear in the official publication , the Pentecostal Evangel , and prayer for healing and testimony commonly occur in church services . 
 While adamant that divine healing is a reality , the AG is not dogmatic on the subject of how one is healed . Margaret <unk> summarized this view stating , " Physical healing is not certain , automatic , or subject to formula . At the same time , it remains a tenet and practice of the Assemblies of God " . Officially , the AG rejects the view that healing is caused or influenced by " positive confession " , a belief found in prosperity theology and Word of Faith teachings . Nevertheless , these teachings have influenced some congregations . 
 = = = = Christ 's Second Coming = = = = 
 The Statement of Fundamental Truths articles 13 and 14 articulate the Assemblies of God 's official teaching on the return of Christ to Earth . It is a <unk> and <unk> eschatology that includes the pre @-@ Tribulation rapture of the Church — the " imminent and blessed hope " . The rapture of the Church will be followed by Christ 's visible return to earth and his reign of 1 @,@ 000 years . This millennial reign will usher in the salvation of the nation of Israel and universal peace . The Assemblies of God is specifically opposed to the theologies and practices of universal salvation , setting dates for Christ 's return , post @-@ Tribulation rapture , and <unk> . 
 = = = Position statements = = = 
 The Assemblies of God has released statements on various issues not addressed in the Statement of Fundamental Truths . These position papers are usually written by the Doctrinal Purity Commission , a standing committee of the General Council , which reviews and responds to issues referred to it by the Executive Presbytery . Position papers are not official positions of the Assemblies of God unless recommended by the Executive Presbytery and approved by the General Council . Position statements touch on biblical , theological , and social concerns . 
 Abstinence from alcohol : On the consumption of alcohol , the AG calls on its members and adherents to live life @-@ styles of total abstinence ( see Christianity and alcohol ) . 
 Apostles and Prophets : The Assemblies of God does not recognize titles or offices of " apostle " and " prophet " . It does , however , believe there are those in the church who " exercise the ministry function of apostles and prophets " . Apostolic functions relate to evangelizing previously unreached areas or people groups , while prophetic functions " occur when believers speak under the anointing of the Spirit to strengthen , encourage , or comfort " . " Prophecy is a continuing gift of the Holy Spirit that is broadly distributed as the Spirit wills throughout Pentecostal churches " . Predictive prophecy that proves false , or prophecy that " departs from biblical truth " is false prophecy . The AG believes in the four ministry gifts of apostles , prophets , evangelists , and pastor / teachers ( see Fivefold ministry ) but notes that there are no biblical instructions for the appointment of apostles and prophets today . 
 Assisted suicide and abortion : Viewing all human life as sacred , the Assemblies of God opposes assisted suicide and abortion ( unless it is medically confirmed that the mother 's life is in imminent , physical danger ) . It believes scripture is silent on the use of contraception and therefore takes no position on this subject ( see Christian views on suicide , Christianity and abortion and Christian views on contraception ) . 
 Creation : The Assemblies of God believes that the account of creation in the book of Genesis " accurately communicates God 's creation of the heavens and the earth " and that " the New Testament treats the creation and fall of Adam and Eve as historical events " . It acknowledges that Christians will have different views on " the age of the earth , the age of humankind , and the ways in which God went about the creative processes " but urges them to " avoid divisiveness over debatable theories of creation " . It also affirms that " God reveals himself both in Scripture and the created order " ( see Creationism ) . 
 Demon Possession : The Assemblies of God believes it is possible for people to be demon possessed and be delivered by the " power of the Spirit , and the name of Jesus " . However , it cautions against overemphasis on demonology and rejects the belief that Christians can be possessed by evil spirits . 
 Ministry to the disabled : The AG teaches that people with disabilities are loved by God . They should be treated with dignity and fully included in the life of the Church . 
 Divorce and remarriage : Officially , the AG disapproves of Christians divorcing for any cause except " fornication and adultery " . Where these circumstances exist or where a Christian has been divorced by an unbeliever ( see Pauline privilege ) , the AG allows " the question of remarriage to be resolved by the believer in the Light of God 's Word " . For Christians who were divorced and remarried before their conversion , it is recommended that local AG churches receive them as members . The General Council has offered this guideline for AG churches ; however , churches are free to determine their own standards of membership with the result that many local churches will admit divorced and remarried persons as members even if the above conditions are not met ( see Christian views on divorce ) . 
 Gambling : The AG opposes gambling , believing that it is a disregard of responsible stewardship , involves a chance of gain at the expense and suffering of others , is inconsistent with the work ethic of scripture , and tends to be habit forming . 
 Homosexuality : The fellowship takes the position that the biblical ideal of marriage is between one man and one woman and that the Bible condemns all sex outside of marriage , whether heterosexual or homosexual . Furthermore , it emphasizes that " believers who struggle with homosexual temptations must be encouraged and strengthened by fellow Christians " and that believers " must hold no malice toward , or fear , of homosexuals " but " reach out in humility and compassion " ( see Christianity and homosexuality ) . 
 Positive Confession : While the AG affirms that " All the blessings which God has for His people are received through faith " ( including salvation , Spirit baptism , " divine preservation " , " healing and provision of material needs " , and the motivation to witness ) , it rejects the teaching that faith or " positive confession " " compels God 's action " . It holds that believers must consider the totality of scripture , consider adequately the will of God , recognize that they can expect suffering in life , and recognize the sovereignty of God . It also stresses the importance of persistent prayer , as opposed to simply confessing or " claiming " the promises of God . 
 Women 's role in ministry : The AG affirms the ministry of women in the church and allows them to be ordained and serve in pastoral roles ( see Ordination of women ) . 
 = = Worship = = 
 Because of the congregational nature of the Assemblies of God , it is difficult to define a typical local church . Church identity is influenced by members ' social class , ethnicity , and musical or worship style preferences . Sociologists Margaret <unk> and John Green have categorized AG congregations into four types : traditional , evangelical , <unk> , and alternative . Traditional congregations are those that strongly identify with the AG ( and Pentecostalism in general ) , while encouraging " more intense experiences of the <unk> , or gifts of the Holy Spirit " such as Spirit baptism and speaking in tongues . Evangelical AG congregations , the most common type , identify with the AG and Pentecostalism but " are moving ( in varying degrees ) away from the unique experiences that were once important markers of Pentecostal identity " . <unk> or charismatic AG churches are those that encourage supernatural gifts of the Spirit but weakly identify with the AG or Pentecostalism . Alternative churches are those where both identity with the AG and occurrence of unique Pentecostal experiences are low ; these include churches adopting seeker @-@ sensitive and emerging church models . 
 Despite the diversity found in the AG , shared beliefs and values are reflected in local churches . The Assemblies of God is " experience @-@ oriented " , and the local church is where experience of the activity of the Holy Spirit will primarily occur . Regular services are usually held on Sunday mornings and Sunday and Wednesday evenings . There is no formal liturgy or order of service ; though , many churches have a familiar routine : opening prayer , congregational and special singing , an offering , a time of intercessory prayer , a sermon , and an altar call . In the traditional and charismatic AG churches , this routine is subject to change spontaneously within a service — possibly being interrupted by an interpretation of a message in tongues , a prophecy , a word of wisdom , or a word of knowledge — and this change is believed to be directed by the Holy Spirit . In addition , evening services may incorporate a time of prayer for those who are seeking something from God either around the altar or in an adjacent prayer room . 
 During praise and worship , participants may raise their hands as an act of worship . Congregational singing is usually led by a choir or worship team . Full drum sets , a piano , an organ , and various other instruments are frequently used . The type of music sung is generally popular worship choruses , such as those by Calvary Chapel and Hillsong . Worship is often characterized as intense and enthusiastic . 
 Prayer features prominently in services . Services may feature moments where special prayer is offered , often with laypersons leading the prayer and the rest of the congregation audibly participating . During these corporate prayers , some may pray in tongues . While not in every service , the pastor will pray for the sick . This prayer may include the pastor anointing the sick with olive oil and with the assistance of church elders along with pastoral associates laying hands on the one seeking healing . 
 Architecturally , smaller churches will feature bright lighting , large windows , a simple platform with a pulpit in the center , and an altar ( " a bench across the front of the church below the platform " ) . Larger churches will have direct access from the balcony to the main sanctuary near the platform so that respondents to altar calls can easily come forward , a large open area in front of the platform to accommodate altar call gatherings , and the platform itself is usually large to accommodate a large choir and musical instruments . Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion , many churches will include a baptistry at the rear of the platform . 
 = = Structure = = 
 The Assemblies of God is defined in its constitution as a " cooperative fellowship " of " churches and credentialed ministers " . It has a representative form of government derived from presbyterian polity and organized in three levels of administration : congregations , district councils and the General Council . The AG has , however , elements of congregational polity , which are limited by the powers of the districts and General Council to license and discipline ordained ministers . 
 = = = Congregations = = = 
 = = = = Self @-@ governing churches = = = = 
 The Assemblies of God uses several classifications of congregations based on their level of local autonomy and their relationship to the General Council . Mature , fully functioning congregations are classified as " General Council affiliated churches " . These churches are " sovereign " and self @-@ governing , but in matters of doctrine local assemblies are subordinate to districts and the General Council . A church is qualified for General Council affiliated status if it : 
 accepts AG doctrines , 
 adopts a standard of membership , 
 has an active voting membership of at least 20 persons , 
 adopts a governance model that prevents a pastor or governing body from " exert [ ing ] dictatorial control over a church " , 
 has an adequate number of spiritually qualified members to fill the offices of the church , 
 has made provision for a pastor who is a credentialed minister in good standing with the General Council . 
 Each local church operates according to its own bylaws and calls its own pastor . The office of pastor is equivalent to that of elder or overseer and is tasked with preaching and teaching the Word of God , in addition to conducting the day @-@ to @-@ day operations of the church . <unk> are elected as a board of deacons to assist the pastor . A General Council affiliated church may withdraw from the Assemblies of God by a two @-@ thirds vote of the church membership . 
 At the request of the pastor , deacon board , or 20 percent of voting members , district officials may intervene in the internal affairs of a General Council affiliated church . If district leaders conclude that district supervision is warranted , the church will lose its status as a self @-@ governing church and revert to the status of " district affiliated assembly " until its problems are resolved . A church may also revert to district affiliated status if it no longer meets the minimum requirements for General Council membership , such as having less than 20 voting members . 
 = = = = District affiliated and cooperative churches = = = = 
 Local churches , sections , and district councils are able to establish new churches . A church plant may initially be classified as " district affiliated " until it meets requirements for General Council affiliation . District affiliated congregations are under the direct supervision of district officials but are encouraged to develop into fully self @-@ governing churches . In 2009 , the General Council created a new category called " parent affiliated churches " . These are either church plants or campuses of a multi @-@ site church under the supervision of a General Council affiliated " parent " church . 
 Existing Pentecostal churches considering affiliation with the General Council may request temporary status as a " cooperating assembly " for a term of four years before officially joining the denomination . 
 = = = Districts = = = 
 Churches are organized into sections and sections into middle <unk> called districts . The 61 districts oversee " all the <unk> and <unk> activities " within their jurisdiction , which includes recommending ministers for national credentialing and mediating disputes within local congregations . There are two types of districts . Geographical districts serve areas corresponding to state boundaries , while non @-@ geographical language or ethnic districts serve a particular language or ethnic group , such as Hispanic and Samoan churches . 
 Districts are governed by representative bodies called district councils , which meet annually . District council membership includes all resident ministers and one lay delegate per AG church located within the district . When the district council is not in session , a district is led by a superintendent and a presbytery ( board of directors ) whose members are elected by and represent the sections . A presbyter " minister [ s ] to ministers " and " model [ s ] spiritual maturity and leadership " to the ministers and churches in his section . 
 = = = General Council = = = 
 At the top of this organizational framework is the biennial General Council , the highest governing body of the Assemblies of God . All ordained and licensed ministers and one delegate per Assembly of God church are entitled to attend and participate at the General Council . The size of General Council is not static but fluctuating , changing from year to year as there is no requirement that pastors attend or that churches send delegates . In general , however , there are over 3 @,@ 000 voting members . 
 General Council enacts legislation , credentials ministers , oversees the national and worldwide missions programs , and directs the church ’ s colleges and seminary . The General Council also elects the general superintendent — the chief executive officer of the national organization — and other officers , such as the assistant general superintendent , general secretary , general treasurer , and the directors of U.S. and world missions . These manage the AG 's day @-@ to @-@ day operations and work together as the Executive Leadership Team . 
 In between General Council sessions , approximately 300 elected representatives from the various districts and foreign mission areas meet as the General Presbytery . When the General Council is not in session , the General Presbytery acts as the official policy @-@ making body of the Assemblies of God . A 20 @-@ member Executive Presbytery , led by the Executive Leadership Team , meets bimonthly and functions as the Assemblies of God 's board of directors . Executive <unk> are responsible to the General Presbytery and are ex officio members of that body . 
 = = = General Superintendent = = = 
 The office of General Superintendent was originally known as the Chairman of the General Council , until it was changed in 1927 . The current General Superintendent of the General Council is Dr. George O. Wood . Wood 's tenure began October 8 , 2007 , when the previous General Superintendent , Dr. Thomas E. Trask stepped down after 14 years of leadership . The following is a list of General Superintendents and their tenures : 
 = = Clergy = = 
 The Assemblies of God recognizes three classifications of ministers : certified , licensed , and ordained . District councils examine candidates for all levels of ministry and recommend those qualified to the Executive Presbytery ( which is the General Council 's Credentials Committee ) , which has authority to issue ministerial credentials . The AG 's constitution guarantees that " formal academic achievement ( diploma or degree ) shall not be a requirement for credentials " , but the General Presbytery does mandate courses and examinations . 
 In preparation for receiving credentials , applicants must either complete correspondence courses through Global University ( the AG 's distance education program ) , receive training through a postsecondary institution such as a college or seminary approved by the AG , or be recommended by a district credentials committee as qualifying for credentials based on self @-@ study and ministerial experience of " substantial duration " . In addition , applicants must pass a standardized exam that tests their knowledge of the Bible , AG doctrines , and ministerial practices . After passing the exam , they are interviewed by their district 's credentials committee . If judged qualified , the district will recommend the applicant to the General Council credentials committee . 
 The Assemblies of God will not grant credentials to divorced and remarried persons if either partner has a former spouse living unless for specific exceptions . Exceptions include if the divorce occurred prior to an applicant 's conversion or for " scriptural causes " such as a former spouse 's marital unfaithfulness or the abandonment of a Christian by a non @-@ Christian partner ( see Pauline privilege ) . The Executive Presbytery has authority to issue ecclesiastical annulments in cases involving conditions that prevent " the creation of a valid marriage union " , such as fraud . Clergy are also barred from membership in secret societies . 
 The Assemblies also recognize a local church credential , which can be issued by a General Council affiliated church for those engaged only in local ministry , such as prison or hospital ministry . Local church credential holders may perform the ordinances of the church with the authorization of the issuing church 's senior pastor . 
 In 2008 , there were a total of 34 @,@ 178 Assemblies of God ministers ( excluding local church credentials ) . Of these , 11 @,@ 544 were senior pastors and 6 @,@ 730 were female .

 = = = Missions = = = 
 A primary reason the General Council was formed in 1914 was to create cooperation in Pentecostal missionary work . Missions have remained a central focus of the denomination since that time . In 2009 , there were Assemblies of God churches in 213 countries and territories around the world . Missionary work outside of the United States is overseen by Assemblies of God World Missions . As of December 2009 , AG World Missions was reporting 2 @,@ 719 personnel worldwide . The agency also provides medical evangelism through <unk> Ministries , founded in 1983 as the Medical Missions Program . This ministry provides free optical , dental , and medical care as well as evangelism . It has operated in 86 countries since its founding . 
 Missions in the United States are overseen by Assemblies of God U.S. Missions . Its seven departments include chaplaincy , Chi Alpha Campus Ministries , church planting , U.S. Mission America Placement Service ( MAPS ) , intercultural ministries , Teen Challenge , and Youth Alive . MAPS offers volunteers the opportunity to contribute to U.S. missions in several ways . One is through church construction and evangelism , and another is through short or long term missions through summer and missionary associate programs . Youth Alive oversees missionary outreach to elementary and high schools . In 2010 , U.S. Missions reported 1 @,@ 059 appointed missionaries , candidates , and spouses . The same year , it reported 542 endorsed chaplains .

 The Assemblies of God in the United States " has grown steadily during the 20th century " . In 1925 , there were just 50 @,@ 386 members in 909 churches , but by the early 1970s membership had reached 1 million . Its most rapid growth occurred from 1971 to 1984 , when the AG grew from a constituency of around 1 million to 2 million over a 13 @-@ year period . In 2011 , average Sunday morning worship attendance for all AG churches in the U.S. was 1 @,@ 872 @,@ 399 people . In the same year , the AG 's inclusive membership ( includes persons of any age that identify with the AG ) was 3 @,@ 041 @,@ 957 people attending 12 @,@ 595 churches . That is an increase of 0 @.@ 4 percent since 2010 . 
 The ethnic diversity of the American AG is increasing ; however , its constituency is still largely white . From 1990 to 2000 , there was a slight decline in white AG churches while ethnic churches , mainly Hispanic , were responsible for much of the denomination 's numerical growth . In 2010 , the AG reported 61 @.@ 1 percent of its adherents as white , 20 @.@ 4 percent as Hispanic , 9 @.@ 1 percent as black , 4 @.@ 1 percent as Asian / Pacific Islander , and 1 @.@ 6 percent as Native American . The remaining 3 @.@ 7 percent were listed as other / mixed . 
 The AG has created various non @-@ geographical language districts to serve immigrant communities whose primary language is not English . There are nine Spanish and two Korean language districts in addition to one each for Brazilian and German speakers . In 2009 , the language districts oversaw 2 @,@ 195 churches with a combined membership of 279 @,@ 422 . 
 Members are fairly well distributed across the United States . California has the largest number of members , followed by Texas and Florida . However , the states with the highest membership rates are Oklahoma , Arkansas , Alaska , Montana , and Hawaii . Growing AG congregations tend to be located in suburban areas , as opposed to urban and rural ones . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origin = = = 
 The Assemblies of God has roots in the Pentecostal revival in the early 20th century . The Pentecostal aspects of the revival were not generally welcomed by the established churches , and participants in the movement soon found themselves outside existing religious bodies . They were forced to seek their own places of worship , and soon there were hundreds of distinctly Pentecostal congregations . 
 After Charles Parham began promoting the idea that speaking in tongues was the initial evidence of the baptism in the Spirit around 1901 , he began to attract a considerable following which he organized loosely as the Apostolic Faith Movement ( AFM ) in 1906 . However , with the rise of the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles , California , and an accusation of sodomy against him in 1907 , he lost and never recovered his influence . After renouncing Parham , the severely weakened AFM regrouped around Howard A. Goss , L. C. Hall , D. C. O. Opperman , and A. G. Canada . They were later joined by <unk> N. Bell , previously a Southern Baptist minister . The AFM had its strength in the rural areas of Kansas , Texas , Arkansas , Oklahoma , and Missouri . 
 In Pentecostalism 's early years , organizational affiliation was fluid , and many ministers of the AFM , which was a white organization , were also licensed by Charles Harrison Mason 's predominantly African @-@ American Church of God in Christ . In 1907 , Goss had received a license to preach from Mason 's group , and he claimed that Mason had given him permission to issue ministerial credentials under the Churches of God in Christ name for the " white work " . By 1910 , the name " Churches of God in Christ " was seen as a more biblical name and began to be preferred over " Apostolic Faith " . 
 The AFM played a leading role in organizing and institutionalizing Pentecostalism in the Midwest and Southwest and from 1909 – 1912 absorbed smaller Pentecostal groups . It also established relationships with Pentecostal missions in the Midwest . The Midwestern Pentecostal movement centered around the Stone Church , pastored by William Piper , and the North Avenue Mission , pastored by William Howard Durham , both in Chicago , Illinois . Durham was the lead promoter of the Finished Work doctrine which , in time , the AFM would adopt and in doing so discard the Wesleyan view of sanctification as a second work of grace . 
 Between 1906 and 1908 , the Pentecostal message had spread among Christian and Missionary Alliance ( CMA ) churches and conferences . At first , it was greeted positively by the CMA leadership , but the doctrine of initial evidence divided the organization . Former CMA Pentecostal congregations in the Midwest and Northeast were left without oversight and began associating with the Apostolic Faith Movement and the Chicago Pentecostal missions .

 = = = = General Council of 1914 = = = = 
 By 1914 , many white ministers nominally affiliated with the Church of God in Christ had become dissatisfied with the arrangement . AFM leaders Bell , Goss , Opperman , M. M. Pinson , and A. P. Collins issued the call for a general council to " Churches of God in Christ , and to all Pentecostal or Apostolic Faith Assemblies " . What resulted was a merger of the AFM , Chicago , and CMA Pentecostals in 1914 at Hot Springs , Arkansas . The 1st General Council was attended by predominantly white representatives from 20 states and missions in Egypt and South Africa . The fellowship that emerged was incorporated as the General Council of the Assemblies of God . Bell was elected the first general superintendent . Five major reasons were given for calling the meeting : 
 Create unity in doctrine and in identifying Pentecostal congregations . 
 Develop ways to conserve the work at home and abroad . 
 Develop a workable system for the support of missionaries . 
 Charter local churches under " one Bible name " . 
 Discuss the possibility of a Bible training school . 
 Other actions taken at the 1st General Council addressed women in ministry . The Pentecostals who founded the Assemblies of God had no objections to women being engaged in ministry . The Pentecostal belief in personal experience , Spirit baptism as empowerment for service , and the need for evangelists and missionaries encouraged women to be active in all types of ministry . What concerned some Pentecostal leaders , such as Bell , were women exercising independent authority over men . The council therefore approved of the granting of credentials to female evangelists and missionaries while restricting the office of pastor to men , and it was not until 1920 that female evangelists could vote at denominational meetings . By the fall of 1914 , out of 512 credential holders , 142 were female missionaries and evangelists . 
 After 1914 , the Church of God in Christ would become predominantly black and the Assemblies of God would remain predominantly white . However , there were African Americans involved in the early years of the Assemblies of God . The African @-@ American pastor Garfield Thomas Haywood , for example , pastored one of the largest churches and was an influential voice within the fellowship until he withdrew from the denomination after 1916 . 
 = = = = " New Issue " and doctrinal clarity = = = = 
 The founders of the fellowship did not intend to create a denomination and originally had no creed or doctrinal statement . However , in response to several doctrinal issues , the most important being the Oneness teaching , the AG felt the need for agreement on central doctrines and to reassure evangelical Christians of its adherence to orthodox belief . Oneness Pentecostalism rejected Trinitarian theology , instead identifying the Jehovah of the Old Testament with the Christ of the New . Furthermore , Oneness adherents believed that Christians , regardless of a previous baptism , should be baptized in the name of Jesus , rather than in the name of the Trinity . By 1915 , it was adhered to by many in the fellowship , including founders such as Goss , Opperman , Hall , and Henry G. Rodgers . Other influential leaders , such as G. T. Haywood , adopted the Oneness doctrine as well . 
 In 1916 , the 4th General Council met in St. Louis to resolve the " new issue " . In a move that caused not a little anxiety , a committee introduced the Statement of Fundamental Truths . Oneness proponents and others saw this as an attack on the authority of the Bible , yet it was adopted along with a recommendation that AG ministers use the Trinitarian baptismal formula . Old preaching credentials were recalled and new ones issued with the Fundamental Truths included . Oneness believers , including a third of the fellowship ’ s ministers , were forced to withdraw , a loss especially felt in the South where the Oneness doctrine had the most influence . A side effect of this was a transition in leadership from former Apostolic Faith leaders , many of whom accepted the Oneness teaching , to men with Christian and Missionary Alliance backgrounds . The Oneness dissenters formed the General Assembly of the Apostolic Churches , which later merged with another group to form the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World . 
 Among the Fundamental Truths was a statement regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism . Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth , an executive presbyter , who argued that while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism it was not the only evidence . The issue was decided at the General Council of September 1918 where Bosworth , who two months earlier had resigned so as not to damage the fellowship , was present and invited to address the council . Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship . 
 While doctrinal controversy led to the withdrawal of ministers , the fellowship experienced growth in subsequent years . District councils were organized in various regions of the country and , where these did not exist , home missionary fields were designated to maximize evangelistic efforts . In 1917 , W. Jethro Walthall led his Holiness Baptist Association of southwestern Arkansas into the Assemblies of God . District councils and missionary stations were established outside the U.S. also . By 1921 , there were districts in Canada ( see Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada ) , China , Japan ( see Japan Assemblies of God ) , India ( see Assemblies of God in India ) , and Egypt . Central Bible College was started in the basement of the Central Assembly of God church in Springfield , Missouri , in 1922 . In 1929 , the fellowship claimed 91 @,@ 981 members in 1 @,@ 612 churches .

 Despite Pentecostalism 's origins in a racially inclusive revival , it accommodated itself to America 's culture of racial segregation rather early . The Assemblies of God was no different . As early as 1915 , an executive presbyter wrote in an article for the Pentecostal Evangel that segregation was " ordained of God " ; however , it was not until 1939 that the General Presbytery enacted a policy prohibiting the ordination of African Americans to the ministry . Districts were still allowed to license African Americans to preach but only in the district where the license was issued . Black Pentecostals seeking ordination were referred to " one of the colored organizations " . This was especially true of the Church of God in Christ , which , despite the fact that it predates the Assemblies of God , was seen as a " younger sibling " . It was not until 1962 , under the leadership of General Superintendent Thomas F. Zimmerman , that the denomination finally began issuing ordinations without regard to race . Three years later the 1965 General Council adopted a resolution affirming civil rights and condemning racism and discrimination . By the 1970s , there was renewed focus on inner @-@ city evangelism and integrated urban efforts . 
 While blacks were excluded from the AG until the 1960s , the denomination 's work among Spanish @-@ speaking people has a long history , first sanctioned explicitly in 1918 . Hispanic outreach became independent of the Foreign Missions Department in 1929 when the first Latin American District was established . By the end of World War II , the AG 's Latin American constituency formed the largest Protestant presence among Hispanics in the United States . The AG also focused on major European immigrant populations , but as later generations assimilated into American culture , these separate European segments were absorbed into the regular geographic districts . 
 During the time when African Americans were barred from ordination , women began to receive greater opportunities for leadership . Women formed an important part of the Assemblies of God 's constituency , many being Sunday School workers and evangelists , most prominent being Aimee Semple McPherson ( who would later found the Foursquare Church ) . This made the issue of women 's place in the movement important in the 1930s . It was also recognized that many congregations who could not afford male pastors relied on women preachers . Despite the fact that opposition to female pastors had been regularly affirmed since 1914 , the office of pastor was opened to women in 1935 . 
 = = = = Relations with other denominations and renewal movements = = = = 
 Between the World Wars , the movement kept a relative isolation from other Pentecostal and evangelical groups , but after World War II , the AG started an approximation with Pentecostal groups overseas . Like the Federation of Pentecostal Churches in Germany and the Assemblies of God in Australia , at that time many national denominations came to affiliate with the U.S. fellowship . These partnerships would later develop into the World Assemblies of God Fellowship . As well as establishing fellowships in other nations , the AG also began to communicate with other U.S. churches . The Assemblies of God was a founding member of both the National Association of Evangelicals and the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America ( now Pentecostal / Charismatic Churches of North America ) . 
 In the 1950s , the AG was challenged by the Latter Rain Movement , which began among former members of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada , the AG 's Canadian counterpart , and quickly spread to the United States . The " New Order " as it was known was highly critical of denominations , such as the AG , and taught that the gifts of the Spirit are channeled through church elders and are given to others by the laying on of hands . However , the Assemblies of God and other classical Pentecostal groups maintained that the <unk> are not personally received or imparted but are manifested as the Holy Spirit wills . In 1949 with a meeting of the General Council approaching , there were fears that the fellowship might split over the Latter Rain issue , but in the end , the General Council was united against what were seen as the excesses of the movement . A General Council resolution specified six errors which included : imparting , identifying , bestowing , or confirming gifts by prophecy and the laying on of hands . It also rejected the idea that the Church is built on present @-@ day apostles and prophets . The Latter Rain theology of no pre @-@ tribulation rapture and the manifested sons of God teaching were condemned as heresy . The Latter Rain and the Salvation / Healing Revival of the late 1940s and 50s would be a major influence on later renewal movements . 
 The affiliation of the Assemblies of God with the National Association of Evangelicals in 1942 signaled the AG 's alignment with evangelicalism and its opposition to mainline Protestantism and the ecumenical movement . The AG and its evangelical partners agreed on most issues and shared similar world views though the AG 's Pentecostal <unk> — Spirit baptism and the operation of spiritual gifts — were not embraced by most evangelical Christians . The AG 's response then to the charismatic movement that began in the 1960s was a cautious one , affirming the move of the Holy Spirit yet urging that all revival must be judged by scripture . For the first time , beliefs and practices which had largely remained confined to the classical Pentecostal denominations began to impact mainline Protestant and Roman Catholic churches on a large scale . The fact that this occurred in these churches ( which were historically seen by Pentecostals as suspect ) , the multifaceted nature of the movement owing to the many different traditions its participants came from , and the perception by Pentecostals that the movement was based too much on experience and not on biblical teaching led some in the Assemblies of God to see it in relation to the ecumenical movement . 
 The charismatic movement forced a reevaluation of what it was to be Pentecostal . The Assemblies of God understood Spirit baptism in the context of <unk> evangelical theology and , by the 1950s , emphasized certain doctrines and practices as requisite for Spirit baptism . Charismatics challenged these views by claiming to receive Holy Spirit baptism outside of this context ( such as remaining in liturgical churches , failing to reject sacramental theologies , and not adopting Pentecostal taboos on dancing , drinking , smoking , etc . ) . On the local level , Assemblies of God churches were influenced by the charismatic movement . Some charismatics left their original churches and joined less formal Assemblies of God congregations . In addition , the contemporary decreased emphasis on traditional Pentecostal taboos in the AG is in part attributable to the charismatic movement , which accelerated a trend already in existence . 
 = = = = Changing views on behavior , war and pacifism = = = = 
 Since their movement 's emergence early in the 20th century , Pentecostals saw themselves as " peculiar people " , and one of the components of this identity were particular prohibitions on behavior . Prohibitions on drug use , gambling , social dancing , consuming alcohol , smoking , attending theaters , bowling , swimming in public pools and beaches , owning television sets , and restrictions on feminine attire and fashion helped distinguish Pentecostals from the larger society . Starting in the 1950s , attitudes in the Assemblies of God on many of these activities underwent dramatic change . The most change probably occurred over views on women 's attire , with the former stance against wearing make @-@ up and jewelry giving way to the acceptance of popular fashion . Most of these " holiness standards " are no longer adhered to ; however , some are still held to , such as proscriptions on smoking , alcohol and drug use . 
 For much of its history , the Assemblies of God officially opposed Christian participation in war and was listed by The Pacifist Handbook as America 's third largest peace church in 1940 . The official position of the church until 1967 encouraged Christian nonviolence : " We . . . are nevertheless constrained to declare we cannot conscientiously participate in war and armed resistance which involves the actual destruction of human life , since this is contrary to our view of the clear teachings of the inspired Word of God " . Most of the founders and first generation members of the denomination held to this view , and it was presented as official teaching throughout World War I and World War II . The official pacifist position remained unchanged until 1967 when the denomination affirmed " the right of each member to choose whether to declare their position as a combatant , a noncombatant , or a conscientious objector " . This was the culmination of a process begun during World War I , when it was unpopular to hold antiwar views , in which AG adherents questioned their denomination 's pacifist stance . 
 = = = Recent history ( 1980 – present ) = = = 
 The Assemblies of God emerged as the leading Pentecostal denomination in terms of status , wealth , influence , and global adherence . In the 1980s , the Assemblies of God saw rapid growth in the US , for several years ranking as the fastest growing American denomination . This growth was mainly the result of its Hispanic outreach ( in 1988 Hispanic members made up some 15 percent of the fellowship 's total constituency ) . The growth of an Asian immigrant constituency was also recognized in this decade when the first Korean district was created . The Assemblies of God gained national visibility in the late 1980s from the popularity and later scandals surrounding two of its ministers , Jimmy <unk> and Jim Bakker . The Assemblies of God launched an effort to increase evangelism and growth in the 1990s called the " Decade of Harvest " . Such efforts failed to sustain the impressive growth of the 1980s , however . From 2003 to 2008 , growth had slowed to an average annual increase of just over 1 percent . 
 With increased growth came increased acceptance and acculturation . Since the 1980s , a growing number of AG ministers have been educated and risen to leadership positions at evangelical institutions , such as Fuller Theological Seminary , Gordon @-@ Conwell , and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School . This " <unk> of the Assemblies of God " has led to the weakening of Pentecostal <unk> , especially the doctrine of initial evidence . Other traditional practices , such as holding prayer meetings and altar services , have faded over time as well . Despite the efforts of denominational leaders to reassert Pentecostal identity and remain more than " evangelicals plus tongues " , the process of acculturation has continued . 
 Even so , churches within the Assemblies of God have experienced revivals in the last two decades which featured worship and practices reminiscent of early Pentecostalism . The most prominent of these was the Brownsville Revival , which occurred at the Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola , Florida , from 1995 into the early 2000s . These revivals often faced criticism from within and without the Assemblies of God for their unpredictability and the dramatic religious experiences of participants . In the case of the Brownsville Revival , the AG 's national leadership gave it cautious approval and support .

 = = Plot = = 
 The Griffin family , Joe , Quagmire , and other residents of Quahog are sent an anonymous letter inviting them to a party in each of their honor . When they get to the address , they find that they are at the isolated island mansion of James Woods , who wants to make amends with them for his various wrongdoings . While they are having a drink , Woods explains he has become a born @-@ again Christian with the help of his new girlfriend , Priscilla . When he and Priscilla leave to check on dinner , Quagmire 's girlfriend Stephanie sits in Woods ' chair and is mysteriously shot to death . The guests panic , believing Woods intends to kill them all . They attempt to leave , but lightning causes a tree to fall across the bridge , the only way off the island . When Woods returns , the guests accuse him of Stephanie 's murder , which he denies . A sudden blackout occurs , and when the lights come back on , Woods has been stabbed to death with one of the dinner knives . Priscilla faints and is laid on a couch , while Stephanie 's body is found missing . The guests discover none of them can get reception to call for help from their cellphones . 
 While the guests search for more clues , a plate suddenly smashes , revealing a gun with a silencer connected to a timer . The gun was pointed toward Woods ' chair , indicating that Stephanie was killed accidentally . Tension ensues , with many of the guests blaming each other for the murder ; however , they all have motives for killing Woods . Mort 's wife Muriel disappears after it is discovered that she was providing Woods with prescription <unk> from her husband 's pharmacy and was being blackmailed by Woods when she got suspicious , causing everyone to then suspect her as the killer . 
 After Joe passes out , seeing as it was his fault , Peter organizes several groups to investigate different parts of the mansion . Brian and Stewie hear a scream and discover Muriel dead , having been stabbed in the back . The guests reunite and discover Priscilla missing from the couch where she was laid . Jillian Russell 's husband Derek points out that he is getting a very faint signal on his cellphone and goes to a balcony to get better reception so he can all the police . As he dials the police , he is murdered and sent over the veranda . Dr. Hartman points out a skull fracture on Derek 's forehead , indicating that he was killed with a blunt object before the fall . Consuela points out that one of Woods ' Golden Globe Awards is missing and the group assumes it was used to kill Derek . The group searches the guestrooms and finds the bloodstained award in Tom Tucker 's room . Tom denies murdering anyone and suggests that Priscilla planted the award there to frame him since she was the only one not there the entire time during the murders . However , Priscilla 's dead body is discovered inside the ventilation shaft over Tom 's room shortly after . He is implicated as the murderer and apprehended after a short chase . 
 The next day , Tom is arrested by the police . Workmen repair the damaged bridge , allowing the guests to return home . Lois goes to comfort Diane over the arrest of her coworker , but a comment Diane makes about her mother packing a blouse for her first solo broadcast — something she could not have known about unless she knew what was going to happen — causes Lois to realize that Diane is the real killer . Diane reveals that she once dated Woods until he dumped her on her fortieth birthday , during which Tom arranged for Diane to be replaced by an attractive younger news anchor . Seeking revenge , Diane bribed Priscilla , a news intern at the time , to talk Woods into becoming a born @-@ again Christian and throw the dinner party so she could get revenge on both men by killing Woods and framing Tom for it . 
 Diane was forced to kill the other guests after her plan went awry upon Stephanie 's accidental death . During the power outage , she stabbed Woods , and Priscilla woke up while she was removing the knife , so Diane killed her . While hiding Priscilla 's body and planting the knife used to kill James Woods in Tom 's briefcase , Muriel saw her and Diane was forced to kill her as well . Diane had no choice but to leave the knife in Muriel 's back because the guests were alerted and quickly rushing to the scene due to the latter 's scream , but not before she wiped her fingerprints off . Diane then killed Derek to stop the police from arriving too soon , as she did not have enough evidence to frame Tom . Lois is still unsure of what happened to Stephanie 's body , to which Diane responds that it is the only thing she has no knowledge of ( it is revealed Quagmire stowed Stephanie 's corpse in the trunk of his car to take home for sexual gratification ) . Diane takes Lois outside at gunpoint , intending to shoot her . Suddenly , Diane is shot , loses her balance , and falls down a cliff . Lois shouts her thanks to the unknown shooter before joining the other guests as they prepare to leave . It is then revealed that the shooter is Stewie , who proclaims , " If anybody 's gonna take that bitch down , it 's gonna be me . " , showing that he still is intent on killing Lois .

 Caldas da Rainha ( Portuguese pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ) is a medium @-@ sized city in western central Portugal in the historical province of <unk> and the district of Leiria . The city serves as the seat of the larger municipality of the same name and of the Comunidade Intermunicipal do Oeste ( OesteCIM , Intermunicipal Community of the West ) . At the 2011 census , the municipality had a population of 51 @,@ 729 in an area of 255 @.@ 69 square kilometres ( 98 @.@ 72 sq mi ) , with 27 @,@ 378 residing in the city . Although the city itself lies about 10 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 5 mi ) inland , three of the municipality 's civil parishes lie on the Atlantic Ocean . Caldas da Rainha is best known for its sulphurous hot springs and ceramic pottery . 
 The settlement was founded in the 15th century by Queen Leonor ( Rainha Dona Leonor ) , who established a hospital and a church at the site of some therapeutic hot springs . The Hospital <unk> Rainha D. Leonor ( Queen Leonor Spring Water Hospital , or Thermal Hospital ) is the oldest purpose @-@ built institution of its kind in the world , with five centuries of history . The city 's name , often shortened to simply " Caldas " , can be translated as " Queen 's Hot Springs " , " Queen 's Spa " , or " Queen 's Baths " . 
 Caldas da Rainha is home to many cultural institutions . The city 's nine museums cover art , history , and cycling . Cultural and sports venues include Centro Cultural e de <unk> ( CCC , Cultural and Conference Centre ) , a centre for performing arts , exhibitions , and conferences ; Expoeste – Centro de <unk> do Oeste ( Exhibition Centre of the West ) , which hosts exhibitions and festivals ; a bullring ; several football ( soccer ) pitches ; and a multi @-@ sport municipal complex . Caldas hosts six professional and higher @-@ educational institutions , including a major arts and design school and a school devoted to ceramics . In 2014 Caldas da Rainha had the best public secondary school in Portugal based on national test scores .

 = = = Early years = = = 
 Caldas da Rainha was part of the ancient region Lusitania , inhabited by ancient Romans who took advantage of sulphurous waters sprouting in the region . Barbarian invasions destroyed most of the Roman @-@ built baths . By the 13th century , the springs were known as " <unk> de Óbidos " , after the nearby town . At this time , a Benedictine order looked after the needs of the poor and cared for the lepers and <unk> , who sought the healing waters . With the disbandment of the order by the 15th century , the area fell into disrepair . 
 Queen Leonor ( Rainha Dona Leonor , in Portuguese ) , the wife of King João II , is credited as the founder of Caldas da Rainha . One day in 1484 , while traveling from Óbidos to <unk> , she happened upon a group of peasants bathing in foul @-@ smelling waters by the roadside . The queen stopped to inquire about this oddity , and the bathers told her that the waters possessed curative powers . She decided to try them and was pleased to find that she was quickly relieved of an unknown affliction that she had been suffering . On that site , the queen ordered a hospital built so that others could enjoy the same relief . Construction began the following year , and although the first patients were admitted in 1488 , the works were not completed until about 1496 or 1497 . To finance the hospital and its adjoining church , the queen sold her jewels and used income from her landholdings . The name of the settlement that grew around the site and became Caldas da Rainha refers to both its founder and the reason for its existence . The city 's name can be translated as " Queen 's Hot Springs " , " Queen 's Spa " , or " Queen 's Baths " . The settlement 's waters remain its major claim to fame . 
 On 21 March 1511 , King Manuel I , brother of Queen Leonor , conferred the status of town ( vila ) upon Caldas da Rainha . In 1821 , it was made a municipality ( <unk> or <unk> ) . 
 = = = Twentieth century = = = 
 In 1901 and 1902 , Caldas da Rainha welcomed 350 Boer men , women , and children who sought refuge from the ravages of the Second Boer War in their South African homeland . Initially housed in the thermal hospital , the refugees were transferred to the park pavilions at the onset of the bathing season . Some rented rooms in town , marveling at the low rates . 
 During World War I , in which Portugal joined the Allies , Caldas had one of three internment camps in the country . In 1916 , most Germans in Portugal were deported , but men aged 15 – 45 were imprisoned to prevent their joining the German military . Originally , all of the approximately 700 prisoners were shipped to Angra do Heroísmo , on Terceira Island in the Azores , where they were held at the Fortress of São João Baptista . In 1918 , to reduce overcrowding at the fortress , 168 internees were moved to Caldas , where they stayed in military barracks located at the Parque D. Carlos I ( <unk> do Parque ) . The prisoners were released the following year , after the end of the war . 
 On 26 April 1919 , President João do Canto e Castro granted the town the title of Dame of the Military Order of the Tower and of the Sword , of Valour , Loyalty and Merit ( Ordem Militar da Torre e Espada do Valor , <unk> e <unk> ) . Unlike other places similarly honoured , Caldas did not add the honour 's collar to its coat of arms . The town was elevated to the status of city ( <unk> ) in August 1927 . 
 During World War II , in which Portugal remained neutral , hundreds of Jewish refugees came to Caldas da Rainha to escape Nazism . Caldas also served as home to British and American airmen who landed or crashed in Portugal or off its coast . In January 1943 , 230 Britons resident in Axis power Italy were evacuated to Caldas , where they were expected to stay until the end of the war . Most of these evacuees were over 65 years of age and had resided in Italy for a long time . 
 In a prelude to the Carnation Revolution , in the early morning of 16 March 1974 , the Fifth Infantry Regiment ( <unk> de <unk> 5 ) , based in Caldas da Rainha in what is now the School of Army Sergeants ( Escola de <unk> do <unk> ) , attempted to stage a coup d 'état against the country 's authoritarian Estado Novo regime . Thirty officers and about 300 sergeants and enlisted men from the regiment left their quarters at 4 : 00 a.m. , heading for Lisbon , where they planned to occupy the airport . On approaching the capital , the Caldas regiment found themselves alone , realizing that the other units supposed to participate in the coup had not joined the upheaval . The regiment turned back and reached their Caldas quarters at around 10 : 00 a.m. , locking themselves in and awaiting a siege . The compound was surrounded by various forces , which penetrated the base at about 5 : 00 p.m. The <unk> were arrested and sent to various military prisons , where they were held until the Carnation Revolution on 25 April 1974 , 40 days later .

 Caldas da Rainha 's coat of arms was granted by Queen Leonor , before municipal coats of arms were typically used in Portugal . The centre of the city 's arms consist of the queen 's personal arms , flanked on the right by a shrimping net , to commemorate the fishermen who rescued her drowning son Prince Afonso , and on the left a pelican feeding its young , a symbol of her husband , King João II . Because of its early introduction , several elements of the arms violate Portuguese heraldic standards . The municipal flag consists of the coat of arms on a purple and yellow <unk> . 
 The municipality adopted a logo for marketing purposes , to project an image of " relevant historical tradition " , " current dynamism " , and " enormous potential in culture , economy , commerce , and tourism " . The logo shows a stylised outline of Queen Leonor 's crowned head in blue tones , representing the city 's historical connection with water . Below the queen 's image , the municipality 's name appears in all caps in Eras Light . Below this " Câmara Municipal " is written in Gill Sans .

 = Scotland = 
 Scotland ( / <unk> / ; Scots : [ <unk> ] ; Scottish Gaelic : Alba [ <unk> ̪ <unk> ] ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain . It shares a border with England to the south , and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean , with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south @-@ west . In addition to the mainland , the country is made up of more than 790 islands , including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides . 
 Edinburgh , the country 's capital and second @-@ largest city , was the hub of the Scottish Enlightenment of the 18th century , which transformed Scotland into one of the commercial , intellectual , and industrial powerhouses of Europe . Glasgow , Scotland 's largest city , was once one of the world 's leading industrial cities and now lies at the centre of the Greater Glasgow conurbation . Scottish waters consist of a large sector of the North Atlantic and the North Sea , containing the largest oil reserves in the European Union . This has given Aberdeen , the third @-@ largest city in Scotland , the title of Europe 's oil capital . 
 The Kingdom of Scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the Early Middle Ages and continued to exist until 1707 . By inheritance in 1603 , James VI , King of Scots , became King of England and King of Ireland , thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms . Scotland subsequently entered into a political union with the Kingdom of England on 1 May 1707 to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain . ( The Treaty of Union was agreed in 1706 and enacted by the twin Acts of Union 1707 , passed by the Parliaments of both kingdoms , despite popular opposition and anti @-@ union riots in Edinburgh , Glasgow , and elsewhere ) . The union also created a new Parliament of Great Britain , which succeeded both the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England . ( In 1801 , Great Britain itself entered into a political union with the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ; the Parliament of Ireland merging with that of Great Britain to form the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Since the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922 , the United Kingdom has comprised Great Britain and Northern Ireland ) . 
 The monarchy of the United Kingdom has continued to use a variety of pre @-@ union styles , titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to Scotland , including : the Royal Standard of Scotland , the Royal coat of arms used in Scotland together with its associated Royal Standard , royal titles including that of Duke of Rothesay , certain Great Officers of State , the chivalric Order of the Thistle , and , since 1999 , reinstating a former ceremonial role for the Crown of Scotland . Scotland 's legal system has also remained separate from those of England and Wales and Northern Ireland , and Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in public and private law . The continued existence of legal , educational , religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of Scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union . 
 Following a referendum in 1997 , a Scottish Parliament was re @-@ established , this time as a devolved legislature comprising 129 members , having authority over many areas of domestic policy . The Scottish National Party , ( SNP ) , which supports Scottish independence , won an overall majority in the 2011 Scottish Parliament general election and legislated for an independence referendum to be held on 18 September 2014 ; a majority of 55 % to 45 % rejected independence on an 85 % voter turnout . The UK Conservative Party won an overall majority in the 2015 UK general election and legislated for a referendum on the UK 's membership of the European Union to be held on 23 June 2016 ; within Scotland , a majority of 62 % to 38 % rejected withdrawal from the EU on a 67 % voter turnout . Scotland is represented in the UK Parliament by 59 MPs and in the European Parliament by 6 MEPs . Scotland is also a member nation of the British – Irish Council , and the British – Irish Parliamentary Assembly .

 " Scotland " comes from Scoti , the Latin name for the Gaels . The Late Latin word Scotia ( " land of the Gaels " ) was initially used to refer to Ireland . By the 11th century at the latest , Scotia was being used to refer to ( Gaelic @-@ speaking ) Scotland north of the river Forth , alongside Albania or Albany , both derived from the Gaelic Alba . The use of the words Scots and Scotland to encompass all of what is now Scotland became common in the Late Middle Ages . 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 Repeated glaciations , which covered the entire land mass of modern Scotland , destroyed any traces of human habitation that may have existed before the Mesolithic period . It is believed the first post @-@ glacial groups of hunter @-@ gatherers arrived in Scotland around 12 @,@ 800 years ago , as the ice sheet retreated after the last glaciation . 
 Groups of settlers began building the first known permanent houses on Scottish soil around 9 @,@ 500 years ago , and the first villages around 6 @,@ 000 years ago . The well @-@ preserved village of Skara Brae on the mainland of Orkney dates from this period . Neolithic habitation , burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the Northern Isles and Western Isles , where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone . 
 The 2009 discovery in Scotland of a 4000 @-@ year @-@ old tomb with burial treasures at Forteviot , near Perth , the capital of a Pictish Kingdom in the 8th and 9th centuries AD , is unrivalled anywhere in Britain . It contains the remains of an early Bronze Age ruler laid out on white quartz pebbles and birch bark . It was also discovered for the first time that early Bronze Age people placed flowers in their graves . 
 Scotland may have been part of a Late Bronze Age maritime trading culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age , which included other Celtic nations , and the areas that became England , France , Spain , and Portugal .
