 The 2010 Commonwealth Games , which ran from 3 to 14 October 2010 , was one of the largest sports event held in India . The opening ceremony of the 2010 Commonwealth Games was held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium , the main stadium of the event , in New Delhi at 7 : 00 pm Indian Standard Time on 3 October 2010 . The ceremony featured over 8 @,@ 000 performers and lasted for two and a half hours . It is estimated that ₹ 3 @.@ 5 billion ( US $ 52 million ) were spent to produce the ceremony . Events took place at 12 competition venues . 20 training venues were used in the Games , including seven venues within Delhi University . The rugby stadium in Delhi University North Campus hosted rugby games for Commonwealth Games . The mess left behind after the Commonwealth Games prompted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to replace Sports and Youth Affairs minister Manohar Singh Gill with Ajay Maken in the 19 January 2011 Cabinet reshuffle . 
 Cricket and football are the most popular sports in Delhi . There are several cricket grounds , or <unk> , located across the city . The Feroz Shah Kotla Ground ( known commonly as the Kotla ) is one of the oldest cricket grounds in India and is a venue for international cricket matches . It is the home ground of the Delhi cricket team , which represents the city in the Ranji Trophy , the premier Indian domestic first @-@ class cricket championship . The Delhi cricket team has produced several world @-@ class international cricketers such as Virender Sehwag , Gautam Gambhir , Virat Kohli , Madan Lal , Chetan Chauhan and Bishan Singh Bedi to name a few . The Railways and Services cricket teams in the Ranji Trophy also play their home matches in Delhi , in the <unk> Singh Stadium and the <unk> Singh Stadium respectively . The city is also home to the Indian Premier League team Delhi Daredevils , who play their home matches at the Kotla , and was the home to the Delhi Giants team ( previously Delhi Jets ) of the now defunct Indian Cricket League . 
 Ambedkar Stadium , a football stadium in Delhi which holds 21 @,@ 000 people , was the venue for the Indian football team 's World Cup qualifier against UAE on 28 July 2012 . Delhi hosted the Nehru Cup in 2007 and 2009 , in both of which India defeated Syria 1 – 0 . In the Elite Football League of India , Delhi 's first professional American football franchise , the Delhi Defenders played its first season in Pune . Buddh International Circuit in Greater Noida , a suburb of Delhi , hosts the annual Formula 1 Indian Grand Prix . The Indira Gandhi Arena is also in Delhi . 
 Delhi also has a football team Delhi <unk> FC , which plays in Indian Super League . Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium is the home stadium for Delhi <unk> FC . 
 Delhi is a member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 .

 In February 2014 , the Government of India approved Delhi 's bid for World Heritage City status . The historical city of <unk> and Lutyens ' Bungalow Zone in New Delhi were cited in the bid . A team from UNESCO was scheduled to visit Delhi in September 2014 to validate its claims . INTACH acted as the nodal agency for the bid . The announcement of accepted cities was to be made in June 2015 . However , the Government of India withdrew its nomination on 21 May 2015 . 
 = Tropical Storm Blanca ( 2009 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Blanca was a short @-@ lived tropical cyclone during the 2009 Pacific hurricane season . Forming out of a trough of low pressure on July 6 , Blanca was immediately classified a tropical storm roughly 420 mi ( 675 km ) south @-@ southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula . Later that day , the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 998 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 47 inHg ) as deep convection persisted around the center of circulation . Shortly after , the system began to weaken . Intermittent bursts of convection occurred on July 7 before Blanca weakened to a tropical depression . The following day , the system degenerated into a remnant low pressure system , devoid of shower and thunderstorms . The remnants were monitored by the National Hurricane Center for another day . Although the storm did not impact land as a tropical cyclone , its remnants produced unseasonable rains in southern California and moisture from the system contributed to flooding in Mexico . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Tropical Storm Blanca originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean on June 19 . Traveling westward , the wave existed in a region of strong wind shear , preventing convective activity from developing . By June 29 , the wave had crossed Central America and moved into the eastern Pacific basin . Several days later , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) began monitoring the system as a disorganized area of shower and thunderstorm activity off the southwest coast of Mexico . Early the next day , a trough of low pressure developed within the system ; wind shear in the path of the storm were expected to be low enough to allow tropical cyclone development . On July 4 , curved banding @-@ features developed along the periphery of the wave , indicating that an area of low pressure had developed . Gradual organization took place over the follow days . Early on July 6 , the low had become sufficiently organized to attain tropical depression strength roughly 435 miles ( 700 kilometres ) south of Cabo San Lucas , Mexico . However , the system was not operationally declared a depression ; instead , the first advisory by the NHC was issued several hours later and immediately declared the cyclone as Tropical Storm Blanca . 
 Upon being classified a tropical storm , Blanca had already developed an eye @-@ feature , though it not expected to develop into a hurricane . The storm maintained a general northwestward track throughout its existence due to a mid @-@ level ridge well to the west of the circulation . Shortly after , a central dense overcast , a large area of deep convection , developed over the center of circulation and large banding features developed along the periphery of the cyclone . Late on July 6 , Blanca reached its peak intensity with winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 998 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 47 inHg ) . Although the storm had intensified , its overall structure had deteriorated , with cloud tops warming and convection shrinking . 
 By July 7 , most of the deep convection associated with Blanca had dissipated , and the remaining convection was confined to an outer band southeast of the center . Later that day , the system was barely holding on to tropical storm intensity as the center became devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity . A brief burst in convection allowed Blanca to maintain 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) winds , minimal tropical storm intensity , for several more hours before being downgraded to a tropical depression . 
 Early on July 8 , another brief burst in convection near the center of Blanca occurred . In this area , satellites found sustained winds around 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . However , the convection quickly dissipated and the winds were not considered to be representative of the storm 's true intensity . By later that day , convection had not reformed around the center of circulation and Blanca degenerated into a non @-@ convective remnant low pressure system , corresponding with the final public advisory from the NHC . Although no longer a tropical cyclone , the remnants of Blanca maintained a well @-@ defined low pressure center as it continued its northwesterly movement . Early on July 11 , the system turned northward and gradually weakened . The following day , the remnants of Blanca dissipated over open waters . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 On July 6 , Mexican officials posted high seas advisories for Michoacán , Jalisco , Nayarit , Baja California Sur and Colima and advised ships to remain at port . These advisories were discontinued the following day as Blanca moved out to sea . After weakening to a tropical depression , moisture from the system enhanced a frontal system over Coahuila . The system produced upwards of 22 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 87 in ) in the span of a few hours , triggering flooding throughout the state . Numerous streets were closed due to flooding and local fire departments were deployed to assist in draining the water . No injuries or structural damage resulted from the flooding . 
 The remnants of the storm also brought unseasonable rainfall , although negligible , to parts of southern and central California on July 11 . The moisture reached the region after being pulled northward by an upper @-@ level low off the coast of Oregon . While over open waters , the storm produced usually heavy rainfall , exceeding 2 in / h ( 50 mm / h ) at times . 
 = The Boat Race 1864 = 
 The 21st Boat Race , an annual side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames , took place on 14 March 1864 . Umpired by Joseph William Chitty , Oxford won by nine lengths in a time of 21 minutes 4 seconds , the fastest winning time since the event was held on The Championship Course in 1845 . The race , whose start was moved in order to avoid interruptions from river traffic , was witnessed by the Prince of Wales . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1863 race by ten lengths , with the overall record tied on ten victories each . 
 The location of the start of the race was moved to approximately 400 feet ( 122 m ) upstream of Putney Bridge in order to reduce interruptions to the race from steamers . Indeed , both boat club presidents had issued a caution to the steamer captains , indicating that the race would be conducted on the ebb tide should any interruption take place which would risk the steamers becoming grounded at Mortlake . The finish was moved the corresponding distance upstream to maintain the traditional length of the race . Oxford rowed in the same boat as the previous race , which was constructed by J. and S. Salter while Cambridge utilised a new vessel built for them by Taylor of Newcastle . Oxford were coached by George Morrison who had rowed in the 1859 , 1860 and 1861 races and was non @-@ rowing president for the 1862 race . The race was umpired by Joseph William Chitty who had rowed for Oxford twice in 1849 ( in the March and December races ) and the 1852 race , while the starter was Edward Searle . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 11 st 11 @.@ 5 lb ( 74 @.@ 9 kg ) , 4 pounds ( 1 @.@ 8 kg ) per rower more than their Dark Blue opposition . Cambridge 's crew , however , was tall , averaging over 6 ft 0 in ( 1 @.@ 83 m ) per rower . Oxford 's crew contained three rowers from the previous years race in William Awdry , F. H. Kelly and W. B. R. Jacobson . The Cambridge boat also saw three participants from the 1863 race : bow John Hawkshaw , number five Robert Kinglake and cox Francis Archer ( who had also coxed the Light Blues in the 1862 race ) returned . 
 = = Race = = 
 The weather on the day of the race was sunny with a mild breeze . The Prince of Wales , future King of the United Kingdom Edward VII was in attendance ; as a result , the start time was moved forward to enable the Prince to leave for another engagement . Oxford were pre @-@ race favourites , and won the toss , electing to start from the Middlesex station , handing the Surrey side of the river to Cambridge . The Cantabrigians made the better start , and soon led by a third of a length . However , by Finch 's field , Oxford had recovered to draw level and started to leave the Light Blues behind . Half a mile into the course , the Dark Blues held a half @-@ length lead which they extended to a length by Craven Cottage . 
 With a clear water advantage , they crossed in front of Cambridge and were three lengths ahead by the Crab Tree pub , extending to " four or five lengths " by Hammersmith Bridge . They were so far ahead at Barnes Bridge their advantage in lengths was impossible " to be accurately counted " . <unk> the position of the finish line , the Oxford crew stopped rowing early , but once aware of their mistake , rowed on to the finish , winning by nine lengths in a time of 21 minutes 4 seconds . It was their fourth consecutive victory and was , at the time , the fastest winning time in the history of the event . 
 = Krypton = 
 Krypton ( from Greek : <unk> <unk> " the hidden one " ) is a chemical element with symbol Kr and atomic number 36 . It is a member of group 18 ( noble gases ) elements . A colorless , odorless , tasteless noble gas , krypton occurs in trace amounts in the atmosphere and is often used with other rare gases in fluorescent lamps . With rare exceptions , krypton is chemically inert . 
 Krypton , like the other noble gases , is used in lighting and photography . Krypton light has many spectral lines , and krypton plasma is useful in bright , high @-@ powered gas lasers ( krypton ion and excimer lasers ) , each of which resonates and amplifies a single spectral line . Krypton fluoride also makes a useful laser . From 1960 to 1983 , the official length of a meter was defined by the 605 nm wavelength of the orange spectral line of krypton @-@ 86 , because of the high power and relative ease of operation of krypton discharge tubes . 
 = = History = = 
 Krypton was discovered in Britain in 1898 by Sir William Ramsay , a Scottish chemist , and Morris Travers , an English chemist , in residue left from evaporating nearly all components of liquid air . Neon was discovered by a similar procedure by the same workers just a few weeks later . William Ramsay was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovery of a series of noble gases , including krypton . 
 In 1960 , the International Conference on Weights and Measures defined the meter as 1 @,@ 650 @,@ 763 @.@ 73 wavelengths of light emitted by the krypton @-@ 86 isotope . This agreement replaced the 1889 international prototype meter located in Paris , which was a metal bar made of a platinum @-@ iridium alloy ( one of a series of standard meter bars , originally constructed to be one ten @-@ millionth of a quadrant of the Earth 's polar circumference ) . This also obsoleted the 1927 definition of the ångström based on the red cadmium spectral line , replacing it with 1 Å = 10 − 10 m . The krypton @-@ 86 definition lasted until the October 1983 conference , which redefined the meter as the distance that light travels in a vacuum during 1 / 299 @,@ 792 @,@ 458 s . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Krypton is characterized by several sharp emission lines ( spectral signatures ) the strongest being green and yellow . Krypton is one of the products of uranium fission . Solid krypton is white and has a face @-@ centered cubic crystal structure , which is a common property of all noble gases ( except helium , with a hexagonal close @-@ packed crystal structure ) . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Naturally occurring krypton in Earth 's atmosphere is composed of six stable isotopes . In addition , about thirty unstable isotopes and isomers are known . <unk> , the product of atmospheric reactions , is produced with the other naturally occurring isotopes of krypton . Being radioactive , it has a half @-@ life of 230 @,@ 000 years . Krypton is highly volatile and does not stay in solution in near @-@ surface water , but <unk> has been used for dating old ( 50 @,@ 000 – 800 @,@ 000 years ) groundwater . 
 <unk> is an inert radioactive noble gas with a half @-@ life of 10 @.@ 76 years . It is produced by the fission of uranium and plutonium , such as in nuclear bomb testing and nuclear reactors . <unk> is released during the reprocessing of fuel rods from nuclear reactors . Concentrations at the North Pole are 30 % higher than at the South Pole due to convective mixing . 
 = = = Chemistry = = = 
 Like the other noble gases , krypton is highly chemically unreactive . In fact , before the 1960s , no noble gas compounds had been synthesized . 
 However , following the first successful synthesis of xenon compounds in 1962 , synthesis of krypton difluoride ( KrF 
 2 ) was reported in 1963 . In the same year , KrF 
 4 was reported by Grosse , et al . , but was subsequently shown to be a mistaken identification . Under extreme conditions , krypton reacts with fluorine to form KrF2 according to the following equation : 
 Kr + F2 → KrF2 
 Compounds with krypton bonded to atoms other than fluorine have also been discovered . There are also unverified reports of a barium salt of a krypton oxoacid . <unk> + and <unk> + polyatomic ions have been investigated and there is evidence for <unk> or <unk> + . 
 The reaction of KrF 
 2 with B ( OTeF 
 5 ) 
 3 produces an unstable compound , Kr ( OTeF 
 5 ) 
 2 , that contains a krypton @-@ oxygen bond . A krypton @-@ nitrogen bond is found in the cation [ HC ≡ N – Kr – F ] + , produced by the reaction of KrF 
 2 with [ HC ≡ NH ] + [ AsF − 
 6 ] below − 50 ° C. <unk> and <unk> ≡ CH ( krypton hydride @-@ cyanide and <unk> ) were reported to be stable up to 40 K. 
 Krypton hydride ( Kr ( H2 ) 4 ) crystals can be grown at pressures above 5 GPa . They have a face @-@ centered cubic structure where krypton octahedra are surrounded by randomly oriented hydrogen molecules . 
 = = = Natural occurrence = = = 
 Earth has retained all of the noble gases that were present at its formation except helium . Krypton 's concentration in the atmosphere is about 1 ppm . It can be extracted from liquid air by fractional distillation . The amount of krypton in space is uncertain , because measurement is derived from meteoric activity and solar winds . The first measurements suggest an abundance of krypton in space . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Krypton 's multiple emission lines make ionized krypton gas discharges appear whitish , which in turn makes krypton @-@ based bulbs useful in photography as a brilliant white light source . Krypton is used in some photographic flashes for high speed photography . Krypton gas is also combined with other gases to make luminous signs that glow with a bright greenish @-@ yellow light . 
 Krypton is mixed with argon in energy efficient fluorescent lamps , reducing the power consumption , but also reducing the light output and raising the cost . Krypton costs about 100 times as much as argon . Krypton ( along with xenon ) is also used to fill incandescent lamps to reduce filament evaporation and allow higher operating temperatures . A brighter light results with more blue color than conventional incandescent lamps . 
 Krypton 's white discharge is often used to good effect in colored gas discharge tubes , which are simply painted or stained to create the desired color ( for example , " neon " type multi @-@ colored advertising signs are often entirely krypton @-@ based ) . Krypton is produces much higher light power than neon in the red spectral line region , and for this reason , red lasers for high @-@ power laser light @-@ shows are often krypton lasers with mirrors that select the red spectral line for laser amplification and emission , rather than the more familiar helium @-@ neon variety , which could not achieve the same multi @-@ watt outputs . 
 The krypton fluoride <unk> is important in nuclear fusion energy research in confinement experiments . The laser has high beam uniformity , short wavelength , and the spot size can be varied to track an imploding pellet . 
 In experimental particle physics , liquid krypton is used to construct quasi @-@ homogeneous electromagnetic <unk> . A notable example is the calorimeter of the <unk> experiment at CERN containing about 27 tonnes of liquid krypton . This usage is rare , since liquid argon is less expensive . The advantage of krypton is a smaller Molière radius of 4 @.@ 7 cm , which provides excellent spatial resolution with little overlapping . The other parameters relevant for calorimetry are : radiation length of X0 = 4 @.@ 7 cm , and density of 2 @.@ 4 g / cm3 . 
 The sealed spark gap assemblies in ignition <unk> in some older jet engines contain a small amount of krypton @-@ 85 to produce consistent ionization levels and uniform operation . 
 Krypton @-@ 83 has application in magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) for imaging airways . In particular , it enables the radiologist to distinguish between hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces containing an airway . 
 Although xenon has potential for use in computed tomography ( CT ) to assess regional ventilation , its anesthetic properties limit its fraction in the breathing gas to 35 % . A breathing mixture of 30 % xenon and 30 % krypton is comparable in effectiveness for CT to a 40 % xenon fraction , while avoiding the unwanted effects of a high partial pressure of xenon gas . 
 Krypton @-@ 85 in the atmosphere has been used to detect clandestine nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities in North Korea and Pakistan . Those facilities were detected in the early 2000s and were believed to be producing weapons @-@ grade plutonium . 
 = = Precautions = = 
 Krypton is considered to be a non @-@ toxic asphyxiant . Krypton has a narcotic potency seven times greater than air , and breathing an atmosphere of 50 % krypton and 50 % natural air ( as might happen in the locality of a leak ) causes narcosis in humans similar to breathing air at four times atmospheric pressure . This is comparable to scuba diving at a depth of 30 m ( 100 ft ) ( see nitrogen narcosis ) and could affect anyone breathing it . At the same time , that mixture would contain only 10 % oxygen ( rather than the normal 20 % ) and hypoxia would be a greater concern . 
 = Final Fantasy III = 
 Final Fantasy III ( <unk> , Fainaru Fantajī Surī ) is a role @-@ playing video game developed and published by Square in 1990 for the Family Computer as the third installment in the Final Fantasy series and the last main series game for the console . It is the first numbered Final Fantasy game to feature the job @-@ change system . The story revolves around four orphaned youths drawn to a crystal of light . The crystal grants them some of its power , and instructs them to go forth and restore balance to the world . Not knowing what to make of the crystal 's pronouncements , but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words , the four inform their adoptive families of their mission and set out to explore and bring back balance to the world . 
 The game was originally released in Japan on April 27 , 1990 . It had not been released outside Japan until a remake was developed by Matrix Software for the Nintendo DS on August 24 , 2006 . At that time , it was the only Final Fantasy game not previously released in North America or Europe . There had been earlier plans to remake the game for Bandai 's WonderSwan Color handheld , as had been done with the first , second , and fourth installments of the series , but the game faced several delays and was eventually canceled after the premature cancellation of the platform . The Nintendo DS version of the game was positively received , selling over one million copies in Japan . 
 It was also released for the many other systems : the Japanese Virtual Console version ( Famicom version ) on July 21 , 2009 ( Wii ) and January 8 , 2014 ( Wii U ) , an iOS port of the Nintendo DS remake on March 24 , 2011 , an Android version on March 12 , 2012 , a PlayStation Portable version on late September 2012 ( Downloadable only version outside Japan via PlayStation Network ) and Android @-@ based Ouya console on April 11 , 2013 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The gameplay of Final Fantasy III combines elements of the first two Final Fantasy games with new features . The turn @-@ based combat system remains in place from the first two games , but hit points are now shown above the target following attacks or healing actions , rather than captioned as in the previous two games . Auto @-@ targeting for physical attacks after a friendly or enemy unit is killed is also featured for the first time . Unlike subsequent games in the series , magical attacks are not auto @-@ targeted in the same fashion . 
 The experience point system featured in Final Fantasy makes a return following its absence from Final Fantasy II . The character class system featured in the first game also reappears , with some modifications . Whereas in the original game the player chooses each character 's class alignment at the start of the game and is then locked into that class for the duration of the game , Final Fantasy III introduces the " job system " for which the series would later become famous . Jobs are presented as interchangeable classes : in the Famicom version of the game , all four characters begin as " Onion Knights " , with a variety of additional jobs becoming available as the game progresses . Any playable character has access to every currently available job and can change from job to job at will . Switching jobs consumes " capacity points " which are awarded to the entire party following every battle , much like gil . Different weapons , armor and accessories , and magic spells are utilized by each job . A character 's level of proficiency at a particular job increases the longer the character remains with that job . Higher job levels increase the battle statistics of the character and reduce the cost in capacity points to switch to that job . 
 Final Fantasy III is the first game in the series to feature special battle commands such as " Steal " or " Jump " , each of which is associated with a particular job ( " Steal " is the Thief 's specialty , whilst " Jump " is the Dragoon 's forte ) . Certain jobs also feature innate , non @-@ battle abilities , such as the Thief 's ability to open passages that would otherwise require a special key item . Final Fantasy III is also the first game in the series to feature summoned creatures , which are called forth with the " Summon " skill .

 One thousand years before the events in the game , on a floating continent hovering high above the surface of an unnamed planet , a technologically advanced civilization sought to harness the power of the four elemental crystals of light . They did not realize that they could not control such fundamental forces of nature . This power of light would have consumed the world itself had the light crystals not had their natural counterparts : the four dark elemental crystals . Disturbed by the sudden interruption of the careful balance between light and dark , four warriors were granted the power of the dark crystals to recapture the power of the light crystals . These so @-@ called Dark Warriors succeeded in their quest , and restored harmony to the world . But their victory came too late to save the doomed civilization , whose culture was reduced to ruin , though their floating continent remained . On that continent , the circle of <unk> , a race of blind soothsayers and fortune @-@ tellers , predicted that these events will ultimately repeat . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 Final Fantasy III focuses around four orphans from the remote village of Ur , each starting off as an Onion Knight in the original game , but as Freelancers in the Nintendo DS remake , which also individualized the party members , giving them unique appearances ( designed by Akihiko Yoshida ) , backstories , personalities and names : 
 Luneth ( <unk> , <unk> ) who symbolizes courage , an adventurous orphan boy raised in the village of Ur ; Arc ( <unk> , <unk> ) who symbolizes kindness , Luneth 's childhood best friend and a timid yet intelligent young man ; Refia ( <unk> ) who symbolizes affection , a girl raised in the village of Kazus who tires of her father 's blacksmith training and often runs away from home ; and Ingus ( <unk> , <unk> ) who symbolizes determination , a loyal soldier serving the King of Sasune , with a ( mutual ) soft spot for the princess Sara . 
 <unk> ( <unk> , Zande ) is the antagonist the party seeks to stop for most of the game , though he is eventually revealed to merely be a pawn of the Cloud of Darkness ( <unk> , <unk> no Kumo ) ( <unk> in the fan translation ) : a malevolent and vicious deity who wishes to push the world into a state of chaos and destruction by upsetting the balance between light and darkness , allowing the Void to consume the world . Appearing in a female @-@ like form , the Cloud of Darkness refers to herself in first @-@ person plural because her two tentacles have minds of their own . Although she initially defeats the Light Warriors , they are resurrected with <unk> and Doga 's help , and , with help from the Dark Warriors , they defeat the Cloud of Darkness . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 An earthquake opens up a previously hidden cavern in Altar Cave near the village of Ur on the floating continent . Four young orphans under the care of <unk> , the village elder , explore the earthquake 's impact and come across a crystal of light . The crystal grants them a portion of its power , and instructs them to go forth and restore balance to the world . Not knowing what to make of the crystal 's pronouncements , but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words , the four inform their adoptive family of their mission and set out to explore an overworld outside the area in which they were brought up , in order to bring balance back to the world . 
 Their adventures lead them to discover that there lies a whole world beyond the boundaries of the floating continent upon which they were living . In the world below , they discover a warlock named <unk> , one of three apprentices to the legendary <unk> Noah , is trying to possess the crystals of light , so as to bring forth chaos and disorder . The four warriors eventually arrive at the Crystal Tower where they discover that the Cloud of Darkness is the source of the recent events . The Cloud attempts to create a similar situation to the Flood of Light a millennia earlier so that the world is pulled into the void . The Light Warriors traverse into the domain of the dark crystals to free the imprisoned Dark Warriors and defeat the Cloud of Darkness , thereby restoring the crystals and balance to the world . In the DS remake , there are also several " side quests " that can also be completed . 
 The story is virtually the same in the DS version , but with some major differences in the introductory sequence : Luneth goes to the Altar Cave alone , but while exploring he trips and falls into a hole created by the earthquake . He is then beset by goblins , and while he is frantically searching for a way out , he comes upon the wind crystal . It tells him that he has been chosen as a Warrior of Light , destined to restore balance to the world , and there are three others like him , but before Luneth can ask it to elaborate , he is teleported to the surface . He returns to Ur , but Elder <unk> does not elucidate much on the matter . Going to a corner of town , Luneth finds his friend Arc being bullied by some of the kids . When Luneth intervenes , Arc runs away , heading for the village of Kazus . 
 Luneth chases Arc to Kazus and , upon reuniting with Arc , discovers that the rumors of a curse on Kazus are not false . The people there are see @-@ through , and one such person , Cid of Canaan , instructs the two boys to take his airship and look for Refia , the mythril smith Takka 's adoptive daughter . They find her on the airship , and accompany her to Castle Sasune as per her suggestion . There , they meet Ingus , a soldier of Sasune who has somehow escaped the curse . He joins the trio after an audience with the king , who instructs them to find his daughter , Sara . They catch up to her in the Sealed Cave , and with her , battle the monster who cast the curse : the Djinn . Just as Sara seals the Djinn away , however , Luneth , Arc , Refia and Ingus all disappear before her eyes . As it transpires , the wind crystal had summoned the four youths in order to grant them a portion of its power . After this , Luneth 's party reunites with Sara at Castle Sasune . She completes the process of dispelling the Djinn 's curse , but becomes depressed when Luneth reveals that he and his companions must leave at once . After Sara stops crying long enough to see them off , they go back to Kazus , where Takka drags Refia home . The three boys consult with Cid , and then Takka , who builds a mythril ram on the ship . It should be noted that Refia is not with him when he returns , and when the party once more finds her aboard Cid 's airship , the player would be able to piece together why : she had told Takka that she is a Warrior of Light like the boys , and therefore has to leave . The new introductory sequence ends with the airship being used to demolish the boulder in <unk> Valley .

 Director and story writer Hironobu Sakaguchi , designer Hiromichi Tanaka , character designer Yoshitaka Amano , scenario writer Kenji Terada , and music composer Nobuo Uematsu returned from the two previous Final Fantasy games to contribute to the development of Final Fantasy III . As with the previous two installments of the series , Final Fantasy III was programmed for the Famicom by Nasir Gebelli . It was the last original Final Fantasy title on which Gebelli worked . Midway through the development of the game , Gebelli was forced to return to Sacramento , California from Japan due to an expired work visa . The rest of the development staff followed him to Sacramento with necessary materials and equipment and finished production of the game there . The completed game was one of the largest ever released for the Famicom , published on a <unk> cartridge , the second @-@ highest capacity available for the console . Like many console role @-@ playing games of the era , Final Fantasy III is noted for its difficulty . 
 Square developed and released Final Fantasy III during the same period that Nintendo released its 16 @-@ bit Super Famicom console , intended as the successor to the original 8 @-@ bit Famicom . Designer Hiromichi Tanaka said that the original game was never released outside Japan because Square was focused on developing for Nintendo 's new console . 
 Square planned to localize and release the game outside Japan , but the game 's localization 's plans were scrapped .

A vocal arrangement album entitled Final Fantasy III Yūkyū no Kaze Densetsu , or literally Final Fantasy III Legend of the Eternal Wind , contains a selection of musical tracks from the game , performed by Nobuo Uematsu and Dido , a duo composed of Michiaki Kato and Shizuru Ohtaka . The album was released by Data M in 1990 and by Polystar in 1994 . 
 Selected tracks the game were featured in various Final Fantasy arranged music compilation albums , including Final Fantasy : Pray and Final Fantasy : Love Will Grow ( with lyrical renditions performed by singer Risa Ohki ) , and the second and third albums from Uematsu 's progressive metal group , The Black Mages . Several tracks from the game were subsequently remixed and featured in later Square or Square Enix titles , including Chocobo Racing and Final Fantasy Fables : Chocobo 's Dungeon . Several pieces from the soundtrack remain popular today , and have been performed numerous times in Final Fantasy orchestral concert series such as the Tour de Japon : Music from Final Fantasy concert series and the Distant Worlds - Music from Final Fantasy series . 
 The score was arranged for the Nintendo DS remake by Tsuyoshi Sekito and Keiji Kawamori , working under Uematsu 's supervision . The soundtrack was released as an album by NTT Publishing in 2006 as Final Fantasy III Original Soundtrack , with revamped versions of the tracks plus some additional tracks .

 There are two distinct Final Fantasy III versions : the original 2D Famicom version , which was released only in Japan , and complete remade 3D version , which was released worldwide . 
 = = = Cancelled WonderSwan Color remake = = = 
 Bandai unveiled their WonderSwan Color handheld system in 2000 and had immediately headed up a deal with Square to release enhanced remakes of their first three Final Fantasy titles on the new console . Although Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II were both released within a year of the announcement , Final Fantasy III was ultimately delayed from its late 2001 release date , even after Bandai picked up the game 's publishing rights . While a port of Final Fantasy IV was eventually released for the WonderSwan Color , Square remained silent regarding Final Fantasy III . Although the game was never formally cancelled , the official website was taken offline once production of the WonderSwan Color consoles ceased in 2002 . 
 In 2007 , Hiromichi Tanaka explained in an interview that the WonderSwan Color remake had been abandoned because the size and structure of the coding of the original Famicom game was too difficult to recreate on the WonderSwan Color : 
 = = = 3D remake = = = 
 Following the failure to remake the game for the WonderSwan Color , and Square 's merger with former competitor Enix to form Square Enix in 2003 , the company posted assurance that the game 's promised remake would not be completely forgotten , and there was speculation that it might find its way to Sony 's PlayStation or Nintendo 's Game Boy Advance as its predecessors had . Square Enix considered porting the game to the PlayStation 2 , but was eventually convinced by Nintendo to develop the title for their new handheld system , the Nintendo DS , a decision that would later be positively reinforced by the commercial success of the Nintendo DS . The Final Fantasy III remake was first announced on October 24 , 2004 , but detailed information did not emerge for a year . Hiromichi Tanaka headed the project as both the executive producer and director . His guidance and supervision were needed because the remake was not a mere graphical update as Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy II 's remakes were , but a total overhaul using the Nintendo DS 's 3D capabilities . Along with 3D graphics , a full motion video opening scene was produced for the game , similar to those found in the ports of the 2D Final Fantasy games for the PlayStation . Programming was handled by developer Matrix Software . 
 The remake was produced by Tomoya Asano and co @-@ developed by Square Enix and Matrix Software . Ryosuke Aiba ( Final Fantasy XI ) served as art director , and Akihiko Yoshida ( Final Fantasy XII ) redesigned the original characters for use in 3D , and designed the look of the new playable characters . The formerly generic and nameless party characters were replaced with more concrete characters with new personalities and background stories , and additional scenes were added to develop their individuality ; however , the main storyline was not altered significantly . Along with these four , additional characters ( called " sub @-@ characters " ) also join the party temporarily , like in the original . Unlike the original , however , these characters may randomly participate in battle . 
 The remake features a redesigned job system , which rebalances the classes , adds new abilities and adds a new " Freelancer " class which replaces the " Onion Knight " as the default job at the beginning of the game ( Onion Knight is retained as a secret class ) . It also includes new events , a new crystal and dungeon , and the removal of capacity points . Unlike the original Famicom version , most of the jobs remain useful for the entire game . The ultimate jobs — the Ninja and the Sage — and some of the lesser @-@ used jobs , like the <unk> , were redesigned to have the same level of abilities as the Warrior . Another addition are special job @-@ specific items available only if a character has fully mastered a certain job . 
 In place of capacity points , each character incurs a small temporary penalty for switching jobs . This penalty decreases the character 's statistics for the next zero to ten battles . This period is called a " Job Transition Phase " and its length is based on how similar the new job is to the old job , and how proficient the character already is at the new job . 
 The remake takes advantage of the Wi @-@ Fi feature of the Nintendo DS in the form of a Mail / Mognet system similar to Final Fantasy IX . Various moogles in the game allow the player to send email to others . Players are also able to send mail to various characters in the game as well as to other players . Side quests can also be unlocked using this system , such as the quest to unlock the Onion Knight . An interruption @-@ save option is also available that lets the player turn off the DS and continue when turning it back on . Like in the original , there is no way to make permanent saves while inside a dungeon . 
 An iOS port of the DS remake was released on March 24 , 2011 on the App Store . Both the gameplay and graphics were improved , and the sound was remastered . However , the Mail / Mognet to other players was removed , with the Onion Knight job available via another quest . 
 An Android port of the DS remake was released in June 2012 on Google Play . A PlayStation Portable version was released on September 20 , 2012 although it was to be a downloadable only version outside Japan where it was released later that month . In April 2013 , Square Enix released a high @-@ definition port of the remake for the Ouya console , as a launch title . A Windows Phone version was also released on December 27 , 2013 . An HD release for Steam , based on the Nintendo DS version , was released on May 27 , 2014 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Upon release , Famicom Tsūshin ( now Famitsu ) gave the Famicom version a score of 36 out of 40 , based on a panel of four reviewers giving it ratings of 9 , 9 , 10 and 8 out of 10 . This made it one of their three highest @-@ rated games of 1990 , along with Dragon Quest IV and F @-@ Zero , both of which scored 37 out of 40 . It was also one of the magazine 's six highest @-@ rated games up until 1990 , along with Dragon Quest II , Dragon Quest III and Zelda II : The Adventure of Link . Retrospectively , the Famicom version of Final Fantasy III is considered a typical RPG of its day , with a high degree of difficulty requiring a significant amount of grinding . 
 In Famicom Tsūshin 's 1990 Game of the Year awards , Final Fantasy III was voted the runner @-@ up for the Grand Prize , with 37 @,@ 101 points , behind Dragon Quest IV . In 2006 , readers of the Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu voted the original Final Fantasy III the eighth best video game of all @-@ time , above Dragon Quest IV . As of March 31 , 2003 , the original Famicom game had shipped 1 @.@ 4 million copies in Japan . 
 The DS remake met with high sales . IGN notes that " interest in <unk> should come as no surprise given ... the popularity of the DS . " The game sold 500 @,@ 000 units within the first week in Japan , beating Square Enix 's original prediction that they would only sell 350 @,@ 000 . According to Enterbrain , by the end of 2006 the remake sold over 935 @,@ 000 copies in Japan . As of August 6 , 2007 , the game has sold 990 @,@ 000 units in Japan and 460 @,@ 000 units in North America . As of August 8 , 2008 , it has sold 480 @,@ 000 units in Europe . This adds up to total worldwide sales of 1 @.@ 93 million units for the DS version , and 3 @.@ 33 million units for the Famicom and DS versions combined , as of August 9 , 2008 . The PSP port sold over 80 @,@ 000 copies in Japan by the end of 2012 . 
 Reviews of the DS remake of Final Fantasy III have been mostly positive , with the game holding an aggregate score of 77 % on GameRankings . 1UP.com described the gameplay as " an RPG for dedicated RPG enthusiasts , " and noted that while the job system had been heavily improved over the original title , it still felt at times " very limiting . " The review however stated that it was important to remember Final Fantasy III as " a slice of history and a missing piece of a blockbuster series , " citing that " hardcore RPG players " may enjoy the title more than other Final Fantasy games and calling it " one of the best portable RPGs to date . " GameSpy argued that one 's enjoyment hinged " entirely on your desire to play a game with decidedly archaic game mechanics that may seem primitive and uninviting " compared to other recent Square Enix titles , noting the game was " quite challenging " and adding that " some people live for this stuff , but others may be annoyed at the game 's often unfriendly nature . " 
 GameTrailers noted that while the plot was simple and the party members generic , the game 's scenarios were " top notch . " It additionally noted that while players should expect to have to do some grinding , the game offers " lots of little areas to explore . " IGN described the game as one that may be " amazingly frustrating for the now mainstream Final Fantasy fan , " and noted that while the unique concept of the job system was one that " simply blew gamers ' minds " at the time , in the contemporary environment , comparing it to Final Fantasy XII 's license board system was " literally no contest . " The review additionally argued that the remake hampered the game , citing that battles that would take " mere seconds to scroll through " were now " lengthened to nearly a minute . " Another complaint was in the game 's presentation on the Nintendo DS , noting that the handheld 's top screen was inactive for " 75 % of the game , " and that even displaying only artwork on the screen during those periods would have been a preferable outcome . However IGN described the game as " graphically phenomenal and ... set to a simply beautiful musical score . " They also stated that the transition from 2D to 3D was " a good call . "

 From 1991 to 1992 , Kadokawa Shoten 's Famicom gaming magazine , Maru Katsu Famicom ( <unk> ) published Legend of the Eternal Wind , from Final Fantasy III ( <unk> <unk> , Yūkyū no Kaze Densetsu Fainaru Fantajī Surī @-@ yori ) , a manga serialization of Final Fantasy III illustrated by Yu <unk> . Based on the original story by Kenji Terada , the manga chronicles the events that take place throughout the course of the game . It was subsequently collected into three tankōbon under Kadokawa Shoten 's Dragon Comics imprint : Legend of the Eternal Wind 1 , 2 , and 3 . 
 The Onion Knight and the Cloud of Darkness are the respective hero and villainess representing Final Fantasy III in Dissidia Final Fantasy , where they are voiced by Jun Fukuyama and Masako Ikeda , respectively , in the Japanese version , and by Aaron Spann and Laura Bailey , respectively , in English . The characters reprise their roles in the sequel , Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy . 
 = Yellow stingray = 
 The yellow stingray ( Urobatis jamaicensis ) is a species of stingray in the family <unk> , found in the tropical western Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina to Trinidad . This bottom @-@ dwelling species inhabits sandy , muddy , or seagrass bottoms in shallow inshore waters , commonly near coral reefs . Reaching no more than 36 cm ( 14 in ) across , the yellow stingray has a round pectoral fin disc and a short tail with a well @-@ developed caudal fin . It has a highly variable but distinctive dorsal color pattern consisting of either light @-@ on @-@ dark or dark @-@ on @-@ light reticulations forming spots and blotches , and can rapidly change the tonality of this coloration to improve its camouflage . 
 Relatively sedentary during the day , the yellow stingray feeds on small invertebrates and bony fishes . When hunting it may undulate its disc to uncover buried prey , or lift the front of its disc to form a " cave " attractive to shelter @-@ seeking organisms . This species is aplacental viviparous , meaning that the developing embryos are sustained initially by yolk and later by histotroph ( " uterine milk " ) . Females bear two litters of up to seven young per year in seagrass , following a gestation period of 5 – 6 months . Though innocuous towards humans , the yellow stingray can inflict a painful injury with its venomous tail spine . This species is taken as bycatch by commercial fisheries and collected for the aquarium trade ; it may also be negatively affected by habitat degradation . Nevertheless , it remains common and widespread , which has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) to list it under Least Concern . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 French naturalist Georges Cuvier originally described the yellow stingray as Raia jamaicensis in 1816 , in Le Règne Animal distribué d 'après son organisation pour servir de base à l 'histoire naturelle des animaux et d 'introduction à l 'anatomie comparée . He based his account on specimens obtained from Jamaica , though no type specimens were designated . Subsequent authors moved this species to the genus Urolophus , and then to the genus Urobatis ( some literature still refers to this species as Urolophus jamaicensis ) . Other common names used for this ray include the yellow @-@ spotted ray , the round ray , and the maid ray . 
 Nathan Lovejoy 's 1996 phylogenetic analysis , based on morphology , found that the yellow stingray is the most basal member of a clade that also contains Pacific Urobatis species and the genus <unk> of Central and South America . This finding would render Urobatis polyphyletic , though further study is warranted to elucidate the relationships between these taxa . 
 = = Description = = 
 The yellow stingray is small , growing no more than 36 cm ( 14 in ) across and 70 cm ( 28 in ) long . It has a nearly circular pectoral fin disc slightly longer than wide , with a short , obtuse snout . The eyes are immediately followed by the spiracles . There is a narrow curtain of skin between the nostrils , with a fringed posterior margin . The mouth is nearly straight and contains a transverse row of 3 – 5 papillae on the floor . There are 30 – 34 tooth rows in the upper jaw and a similar number in the lower jaw , arranged into bands . The teeth are broad @-@ based , with low , blunt crowns in females and juveniles , and tall , pointed cusps in adult males . The teeth of males are more widely spaced than those of females . The pelvic fins have nearly straight leading margins and rounded trailing margins . 
 The tail is stout and flattened , comprising less than half the total length , and terminates in a small , leaf @-@ shaped caudal fin about a quarter high as long , that is continuous around the last vertebra . A serrated spine is positioned about halfway along the tail . Newborn rays are smooth @-@ skinned ; shortly after birth small , blunt tubercles appear in the middle of the back , which in larger adults extends to between the eyes , the " shoulders " , and the base of the tail . Adults also develop recurved thorns along the upper margin of the caudal fin . The color and pattern of the yellow stingray varies significantly among individuals , though most follow one of two schemes : minute dark green or brown reticulations on a light background , or dense white , yellow , or golden spots on a dark green or brown background . The underside is yellowish , greenish , or brownish white , with small darker spots toward the disc margin and the tail . This species is capable of rapidly changing the tone and contrast of its coloration to better match its environment . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The yellow stingray is found throughout the inshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico ( where it is the only representative of its family ) and the Caribbean Sea , including Florida , the Bahamas , and the Greater and Lesser Antilles to Trinidad . On rare occasions , it ranges as far north as Cape Lookout in North Carolina . It is quite abundant in the Florida Keys and parts of the Antilles , and rather uncommon elsewhere . Off Mexico , this species occupies a salinity range of 26 – 40 ppt . 
 Benthic in nature , the yellow stingray inhabits coastal habitats such as bays , lagoons , estuaries , and low @-@ energy surf zones , and has been reported from the water 's edge to a depth of 25 m ( 82 ft ) . It particularly favors insular hard @-@ bottomed habitats with a dense encrustation of sessile invertebrates ( termed live @-@ bottom habitats ) , but can also be found over sand , mud or seagrass ( Thalassia ) , sometimes in the vicinity of coral reefs . Off Jamaica , large numbers of yellow stingrays , up to one per square meter , gather beneath the aerial roots of mangrove trees used as roosts by cattle egrets ( Bubulcus ibis ) ; it is theorized that the birds ' droppings sustain invertebrates that attract the rays . There is no evidence of seasonal migration , though during the spring females tend to be found closer to shore than males . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 During the day , the yellow stingray is fairly inactive and spends much time buried under a thin layer of sediment or lying motionless in vegetation . Tracking studies have shown that it generally remains within a small home range of around 20 @,@ 000 m2 ( 220 @,@ 000 sq ft ) , with individuals covering only a portion of the entire area on any particular day . It favors the boundaries between different terrain , such as sand and reef . Its <unk> eyes give it a 360 ° panoramic view of its surroundings ; each eye bears an elaborate covering or " operculum " that allows fine control over the amount of light entering the pupil . Therefore , the resting ray is well equipped to detect approaching predators , which may potentially include any large carnivorous fish such as the tiger shark ( Galeocerdo cuvier ) . The yellow stingray is most sensitive to sounds of 300 – 600 Hertz , which is fairly typical among sharks and rays that have been investigated thus far . It and other stingrays have a large brain relative to other rays , comprising around 1 – 2 % of the body weight . 
 The diet of the yellow stingray is poorly documented but includes shrimps , and likely also worms , clams , and small bony fishes . Typically , the ray will settle over a prey item and trap it against the bottom , whereupon it is manipulated to the mouth with motions of the disc . Like the related round stingray ( U. <unk> ) , this species sometimes uses undulations of its disc margins to excavate pits and reveal buried prey . It has also been observed raising the front of its disc to create a shaded " cave " , to attract shelter @-@ seeking organisms . Known parasites of the yellow stingray include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium <unk> , Phyllobothrium <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Rhinebothrium <unk> , and R. <unk> , and the monogenean Dendromonocotyle <unk> . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 Like other stingrays , the yellow stingray is aplacental viviparous : at first the embryos are sustained by yolk , which is later supplanted by <unk> ( " uterine milk " , rich in proteins and lipids ) , delivered by the mother through numerous finger @-@ like extensions of the uterine epithelium called " trophonemata " . Mature females have two functional uteruses , with the left used more than the right . Except in a few individuals , only the left ovary is functional . The reproductive cycle is biannual with a 5 – 6 month long gestation period . The first period of ovulation occurs from January to April , peaking in late February and early March , with birthing from June to September , peaking in late July and early August . The second period of ovulation occurs from August to September , with birthing from November to January . The two cycles overlap as vitellogenesis ( yolk formation ) begins while the female is still pregnant . 
 Courtship and mating in the yellow stingray involves one or more males closely following a female , seeking to bite and grip the rear margin of her disc ; the high , pointed teeth of males serve to aid in this endeavor . Once the male successfully holds onto the female , he flips under her so that the two are aligned abdomen @-@ to @-@ abdomen , and inserts a single clasper into her cloaca . Rival males may attempt to interfere with the mating pair by biting or bumping them . In one observation that took place in water 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) deep near Tobacco Caye on the Belize Barrier Reef , the male pursuit lasted between 30 and 60 seconds and copulation lasted four minutes . 
 The predominant source of embryonic nutrition is histotroph , which supports a 46 @-@ fold weight increase from ovum to near @-@ term fetus . By the time the embryo is 4 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) across , it has fully resorbed its yolk sac and external gills . The litter size ranges from one to seven . The first litter of the year ( spring @-@ summer ) is larger than the second ( autumn @-@ winter ) , with the number of offspring increasing with the size of the female ; this relationship is not observed for second litter . On the other hand , the newborns of the first litter tend to be slightly smaller than those of the second litter , at an average length of 14 @.@ 5 cm ( 5 @.@ 7 in ) versus 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) . The second litter 's fewer , larger young may reflect the lower temperatures of autumn @-@ winter , which results in slower growth . Seagrass beds serve as important habitat for parturition . The newborns emerge tail @-@ first and are similar in coloration to the adults , though the disc is relatively wider . They also have a small " knob " or " tentacle " that covers most of the spiracle , which is resorbed shortly after birth . Males and females reach sexual maturity at disc widths of 15 – 16 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 – 6 @.@ 3 in ) and 20 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) respectively . The maximum lifespan is 15 – 25 years . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Generally , yellow stingrays pay little heed to divers and can be approached closely . If stepped on or otherwise provoked , however , this ray will defend itself with its tail spine , coated in potent venom . The resulting wound is extremely painful , but seldom life @-@ threatening . Small and docile , the yellow stingray adapts readily to captivity and has reproduced in the aquarium ; it requires a large amount of space ( at least 180 gal or 684 L ) and a fine , deep substrate with minimal ornamentation . 
 The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed the yellow stingray under Least Concern , citing its wide distribution and high abundance in certain regions . In addition , its small size implies relatively high productivity , which would make its population more resilient to fishing pressure . This species is not targeted commercially , but is probably taken incidentally by inshore fisheries throughout its range . It is also harvested for the home aquarium trade , being the most frequently available member of its family on the North American market . The extent of this trade has not yet been quantified . Another potential threat is habitat degradation , particularly to seagrass beds . No conservation measures have been enacted for this species .

 Stay Trippy was met with generally positive reviews from music critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 66 , based on 11 reviews , which indicates " generally favorable reviews " . Al Shipley of the Baltimore City Paper gave the album a positive review , saying " Stay Trippy winds up as something of a triumph , one of the year 's most thoroughly enjoyable major label albums . " David Jeffries of AllMusic said , " Fans will need four or five hands to count all the other laugh @-@ out @-@ loud punch lines , and even if this album is redundant and overstuffed with hedonism and recklessness , that 's just Juicy being Juicy . " Rick Florino of Artistdirect stated , " Stay Trippy is as wild as modern hip @-@ hop gets . It 's a slick , seductive , and stone romp through a hazy synth boom , strip club @-@ ready beats , and some of Juicy J 's tightest rapping to date . " Stacy @-@ Ann Ellis of Vibe gave the album a positive review , saying " Despite the wild assortment of flows and flavors , Juicy J manages to avoid being eclipsed on his own project . Their presence only amplifies the quality of his offering , a hypothesis that is reinforced by three of the album 's standout pieces . " B.J. Steiner of XXL said , " Stay Trippy is a record that knows to stay within the lane that it 's carved for itself . Big @-@ budget stripper rap has rarely sounded so fresh . " Nick Henderson of Tiny Mix Tapes gave the album three out of five stars , saying " On Stay Trippy , Juicy J sounds as energized , self @-@ assured , and dangerous as ever .

 Chris Kelly of Fact said , " By embracing the codeine @-@ weed @-@ molly trifecta , hashtag @-@ friendly hooks , and — perhaps most significantly — ascendant producers , the 38 @-@ year @-@ old rapper has maintained rap relevance , even as that has become more difficult than ever . " Peter Marrack of Exclaim ! stated , " For all its vulgarity , predictability , repetitiveness and reckless musings on drugs , Juicy J 's trippy music succeeds because of its spirit . " Julia LeConte of Now said , " The whole thing isn 't about disrespecting women , though . Some songs merely weave the misogyny around simple @-@ pleasure narratives : popping molly , making money .

" David " <unk> " Lee of HipHopDX said , " Some Rap is tailor made for headphone listening and careful analysis of every word . Then there are songs that are meant to be played loud in public settings , and the lyrics don 't matter so much . If you haven 't already figured it out , Stay Trippy is the latter . And for as much flack as it receives , there is entertainment value there and it serves its purpose as a soundtrack to the ' trippy ' lifestyle . "

 = River Avon ( Bristol ) = 
 The River Avon / <unk> / is an English river in the south west of the country . To distinguish it from a number of other rivers of the same name , this river is often also known as the Bristol Avon . The name " Avon " is a cognate of the Welsh word afon , " river " . 
 The Avon rises just north of the village of Acton Turville in South Gloucestershire , before flowing through Wiltshire . In its lower reaches from Bath to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth near Bristol the river is navigable and known as the Avon Navigation . 
 The Avon is the 19th longest river in the UK at 75 miles ( 121 km ) although there are just 19 miles ( 31 km ) as the crow flies between the source and its mouth in the Severn Estuary . The catchment area is 2 @,@ 220 square kilometres ( 860 sq mi ) . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name " Avon " is a cognate of the Welsh word afon [ <unk> ] " river " , both being derived from the Common Brittonic <unk> , " river " . " River Avon " , therefore , literally means " River River " ; several other English and Scottish rivers share the name . The County of Avon that existed from 1974 to 1996 was named after the river , and covered Bristol , Bath , and the lower Avon valley . 
 = = Course = = 
 The Avon rises east of the town of Chipping Sodbury in South Gloucestershire , just north of the village of Acton Turville . Running a somewhat circular path , the river drains east and then south through Wiltshire . Its first main settlement is the village of <unk> , two miles ( 3 km ) inside the Wiltshire border , and then on to <unk> . At Malmesbury it joins up with its first major tributary , the Tetbury Avon , which rises just north of Tetbury in Gloucestershire . This tributary is known locally as the Ingleburn , which in Old English means ' English river ' . Here , the two rivers almost meet but their path is blocked by a rocky outcrop of the Cotswolds , almost creating an island for the ancient hilltop town of Malmesbury to sit on . Upstream of this confluence the river is sometimes referred to as the ' River Avon ( <unk> Branch ) ' to distinguish it from the Tetbury Branch . 
 After the two rivers merge , the Avon then turns south east away from the Cotswolds and then quickly south into the clay <unk> Vale , where it is joined by the River Marden , until it reaches the biggest town so far , Chippenham . The wide vale is now known as the Avon Vale , and the river flows on via Lacock to Melksham , then turns north @-@ west through Bradford on Avon , where the centre of the town grew up around the ford across the river Avon , hence the origin of the town 's name ( " Broad @-@ Ford " ) . This was supplemented in Norman times by the stone bridge that still stands today . The Norman side is upstream , and has pointed arches ; the newer side has curved arches . The Town Bridge and Chapel is a grade I listed building . It was originally a Packhorse bridge , but widened in the 17th century by rebuilding the western side . On the bridge stands a small building which was originally a chapel but later used as a town lock @-@ up . 
 The Avon Valley between Bradford on Avon and Bath is a classic geographical example of a valley where four forms of ground transport are found : road , rail , river , canal . The river passes under the Avoncliff and Dundas <unk> and at Freshford is joined by the Somerset River Frome . Avoncliff Aqueduct was built by John Rennie and chief engineer John Thomas , between 1797 and 1801 . The aqueduct consists of three arches and is 110 yards ( 100 m ) long with a central elliptical arch of 60 ft ( 18 m ) span with two side arches each semicircular and 34 ft ( 10 m ) across , all with V @-@ jointed arch stones . The spandrel and wing walls are built in alternate courses of ashlar masonry , and rock @-@ faced blocks . The central span sagged soon after it was built and has been repaired many times . The Dundas Aqueduct was built by the same team between 1797 and 1801 and completed in 1805 . James <unk> was appointed contractor . The aqueduct is 150 yards ( 137 @.@ 2 m ) long with three arches built of Bath Stone , with Doric pilasters , and balustrades at each end . The central semicircular arch spans 64 feet ( 19 @.@ 5 m ) ; the two oval side arches span 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) . It is a grade I listed building , and was the first canal structure to be designated as an Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1951 . The stretch of river below and above the aqueduct , where it is joined by Midford Brook , is used by the <unk> of the Monkton Combe School Boat Club up to six days a week since at least the 1960s . 
 It then flows past Claverton Pumping Station , which pumped water from the River Avon into the canal , using power from the flow of the river . The pumping station is located in a pump house built of Bath Stone , located at river level . Water is diverted from the river by Warleigh Weir , about 200 yd ( 180 m ) upstream . The water flows down a leat to the pumping station , where it powers a water wheel , 24 ft ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) wide and 17 ft ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) in diameter , with 48 wooden slats . At full power the wheel uses 2 tons ( 2 tonnes ) of water per second and rotates five times a minute . The water wheel drives gearing which increases the speed to 16 rpm . From here , cranks drive vertical connecting rods which transfer the energy to two 18 ft ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) long cast iron rocking beams . Each rocking beam in turn drives an 18 in ( 0 @.@ 5 m ) diameter lift pump , which also take their supply from the mill leat . Each pump stroke raises 50 imperial gallons ( 230 l ; 60 US gal ) of water to the canal . In 1981 , British Waterways installed two 75 horsepower ( 56 kW ) electric pumps just upstream from the station . 
 The Avon then flows through Bathford , where it is joined by the <unk> River , and Bathampton where it passes under the Bathampton Toll Bridge , joined by the Lam Brook at Lambridge in Bath and then it passes under Cleveland and Pulteney Bridges and over the weir . Cleveland Bridge was built in 1826 by William Hazledine , owner of the Coalbrookdale Ironworks , with Henry Goodridge as the architect , on the site of a Roman ferry crossing . Named after the 3rd Duke of Cleveland , it spans the River Avon at Bathwick , and enabled further development of Georgian Bath to take place on the south side of the river . It was designed by architect Henry Goodridge to take the traffic of his day , horse @-@ drawn vehicles and pedestrians , and was constructed using Bath Stone and a cast iron arched span . Pulteney Bridge was completed in 1773 and is designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building . The bridge was designed by Robert Adam , whose working drawings are preserved in the Sir John Soane 's Museum , and is one of only four bridges in the world with shops across the full span on both sides . It is named after Frances Pulteney , heiress in 1767 of the Bathwick estate across the river from Bath . Pulteney approached the brothers Robert and James Adam with his new town in mind , but Robert Adam then became involved in the design of the bridge . In his hands the simple construction envisaged by Pulteney became an elegant structure lined with shops . Adam had visited both Florence and Venice , where he would have seen the Ponte Vecchio and the Ponte di Rialto . But Adam 's design more closely followed Andrea Palladio 's rejected design for the Rialto . Pulteney Bridge stood for less than 20 years in the form that Adam created . In 1792 alterations to enlarge the shops marred the elegance of the façades . Floods in 1799 and 1800 wrecked the north side of the bridge , which had been constructed with inadequate support . It was rebuilt by John Pinch the elder , surveyor to the Pulteney estate , in a less ambitious version of Adam 's design . 19th century shopkeepers altered windows , or cantilevered out over the river as the fancy took them . The western end pavilion on the south side was demolished in 1903 for road widening and its replacement was not an exact match . In 1936 the bridge became scheduled as a national monument , with plans being made for the restoration of the original façade . The restoration was completed in time for the Festival of Britain in 1951 , with further work being carried out in 1975 . Bath and North East Somerset council have discussed plans to ban vehicles from the bridge and turn it into a pedestrianised zone , however it remains open to buses and taxis . 
 The river is then joined by the Kennet and Avon Canal which connects with the Avon just below the weir at Bath Locks . Together with the Kennet Navigation which joins the River Thames at Reading so providing a through route for canal boats from Bristol to London . From this point downstream it is known as the Avon Navigation . 
 = = = Navigation = = = 
 The Avon above Bath remains navigable as far as Bathampton where there is the remains of a " Flash Lock " . However the lock past the weir by Pulteney Bridge was demolished when the weir was reconstructed so passage between the sections is only possible for dinghies and canoes using the roller slipway on the side of the weir . 
 Beyond its junction with the Kennet and Avon Canal , the Avon flows through Keynsham towards Bristol . For much of its course after leaving Wiltshire , it marks the traditional boundary between Somerset and Gloucestershire . For most of this distance the navigation makes use of the natural river bed , with six locks overcoming a rise of 30 feet ( 9 m ) . From Bath to Netham Lock where it divides into the New Cut and the Floating Harbour is 12 miles ( 19 km ) . The stretch is made navigable by the use of locks and weirs . 
 In the city centre of Bath it passes under various bridges including the Midland Bridge which was originally built by the Midland Railway Company to allow the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway access to and from its Green Park Terminus Station . In November 2011 the navigation between Bath and Bristol was closed because of safety concerns about Victoria Bridge . Weston Lock on the outskirts of Bath is in what now forms the Newbridge . Weston Cut is a man made channel , opened in 1727 , for boats to approach and pass through Weston Lock , which created an island between the cut and the river weir , which became known as Dutch Island after the owner of the brass mill established on the riverside in the early 18th century . 
 Kelston Lock and weir have permanent moorings above and below them . The Riverside Inn and Saltford Marina are also close by . Saltford Lock and weir are overlooked by the remains of the Kelston Brass Mill , which was working until 1925 . It is a grade II listed building . Alongside the lock is a pub , whose garden extends over the lock to the small island between the lock and weir . The lock was opened in 1727 and destroyed in 1738 by rival coal dealers to stop the use of the river for transportation . In its heyday , between 1709 and 1859 Swineford had an active brass and copper industry around the Swineford Lock which were served by the river which also provided water power for the cloth industry , as did the River Boyd , a tributary which flows into the Avon near Bitton . Keynsham Lock opened in 1727 . Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a pub , on an island between the lock and the weir . The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the River Chew . Hanham is the last tidal lock , after which the river is joined by Brislington Brook . 
 Netham Lock is the point at Netham in Bristol at which boats from the River Avon , gain access to Bristol 's Floating Harbour . Construction started in 1804 to build the tidal New Cut , where it is joined by the River Malago , and divert the Avon along the Feeder Canal to the harbour ; a system designed and built by William Jessop and later improved by Isambard Kingdom Brunel . A weir carries the river into the New Cut and boats use the adjacent lock . Access to the harbour is only possible during the day when the lock keeper will open the gates unless the water level in the river between Netham and Hanham is above or below the level of the harbour . Netham Lock and the weir form part of Bristol 's flood defence mechanisms and it was announced in December 2008 that they would be upgraded as part of the £ 11 million City Docks Capital Project . 
 In central Bristol , where the river is tidal , it is diverted from its original course into the New Cut , a channel dug between 1804 and 1809 at a cost of £ 600 @,@ 000 . The original course is held at a constant level by lock gates ( designed by Jessop ) and is known as the Floating Harbour . The Floating Harbour is protected by an 1870s replacement for Jessop 's locks . This unusual dock has a tentacled plan resulting from its origins as the natural river course of the Avon and its tributaries , the River Frome and <unk> Brook , and is intimately entwined with Bristol 's city centre as few docks are . As a result of this , the Floating Harbour is one of the more successful pieces of dockland regeneration , with much of the dockside now occupied by residential , office and cultural premises , and the water area heavily used by leisure craft . The Floating Harbour gave the port an advantage by enabling shipping to stay afloat rather than grounding when the tide went down . Downstream of central Bristol the river passes through the deep Avon Gorge , spanned by Brunel 's Clifton Suspension Bridge , the river is tidal and is navigable by seagoing vessels at high tide but drying to a steep sided muddy channel at low tide . It was largely the challenge of navigating this section that sealed the fate of the Floating Harbour as commercial docks and saw them replaced by docks at Avonmouth where the Avon joins the Severn Estuary . 
 Before reaching its mouth it is joined by the River Trym at Sea Mills which was the site of Portus Abonae a Roman port . Shortly after it passes the village of Pill on the south bank where the Pill <unk> were based in order to tow ships up the river to Bristol and where yachts and other boats still have moorings in Chapel Pill and <unk> Pill . It then passes under the Avonmouth Bridge which carries the M5 motorway . The main span is 538 ft ( 164 m ) long , and the bridge is 4 @,@ 554 ft ( 1 @,@ 388 m ) long , with an air draught above mean high water level of 98 @.@ 4 ft ( 30 m ) . The river then serves two major dock areas . The Royal Portbury Dock is located on the southern side of the mouth of the river . The deepwater dock was constructed between 1972 and 1977 , and is now a major port for the import of motor vehicles . The Royal Portbury Dock has the largest entrance lock into any UK port , accommodating vessels up to 41 m ( 135 ft ) beam , 290 m ( 951 ft ) length and 14 @.@ 5 m ( 48 ft ) draft . The Avonmouth Docks are on the north side of the river and are one of the UK 's major ports for chilled foods , especially fruit and vegetables . The first dock at Avonmouth , Avonmouth Old Dock , was opened in 1877 and acquired by Bristol Corporation in 1884 . In 1908 , a much larger dock , the Royal Edward Dock , was opened . The docks form part of the Port of Bristol and were operated by the Port of Bristol Authority , part of Bristol City Council , until 1991 when the council granted a 150 @-@ year lease to the Bristol Port Company .

 For the purpose of water quality monitoring and improvement the river is divided into several catchment management areas ; South of Malmesbury , Bristol Avon Rural and Bristol Avon Urban . In the rural area 22 water bodies are classified as good , 46 as moderated and 8 as poor . The main reasons for not achieving good scores are pollution from waste water , agriculture and rural land management . In the urban area one water body is rated good , while 12 are rated moderate and one is poor . The pollution from upstream is added to by the effects of industry , manufacturing and other businesses and is significantly affected by physical modifications to the water course . Within the catchment area there are 137 river water bodies and 6 lakes ; of these 22 percent of rivers are rated as good ecological status , 40 percent good for chemical status and 31 percent good for biological status . 
 = = Conservation areas = = 
 The river is important for its dragonfly communities , with a strong population of Scarce Chaser ( found in only six other areas in England ) , together with a strong population of White @-@ legged Damselfly . Red @-@ eyed Damselfly is also found . The river is also important for aquatic plants , including Loddon <unk> . 
 The <unk> – West <unk> Site of Special Scientific Interest , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) north east of Chippenham , is of geological interest as the river bank exposes Callovian highly @-@ fossiliferous sandstone which contains well @-@ preserved bivalves , gastropods , brachiopods , belemnites and ammonites . Further downstream at Newton St Loe the Newton St Loe SSSI is another Geological Conservation Review SSSI . It represents the only remaining known exposure of fossiliferous Pleistocene gravels along the River Avon . In conjunction with other sites within the wider area , it has aided the development of a scientific understanding of the history of early glaciation within South West England . The bodies of mammoths ( Mammuthus ) and horses ( Equus ) have been found at the site . 
 The Avon Gorge has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest because it supports some rare fauna and flora , including species unique to the gorge . There are a total of 24 rare plant species and two unique trees : the Bristol and <unk> 's whitebeams . Other notable plants include Bristol Rock @-@ cress , Bristol onion , Spiked Speedwell , Autumn Squill and <unk> . Other areas along the river which have this designation include Bickley Wood , Cleeve Wood , Hanham for its large population of Bath Asparagus ( <unk> <unk> ) . Stidham Farm near Keynsham contains at least At least 2 metres ( 7 ft ) of Pleistocene terrace @-@ gravels , consisting of limestone clasts mainly , but also with Millstone Grit , Pennant Sandstone , flint and chert clasts . The site is of considerable importance for studies relating to the possible glaciation of the area , and of the terrace stratigraphy , particularly as it is one of only two accessible terrace deposits in this part of the Avon valley . Newton St Loe SSSI is also listed for geological reasons as it represents the only remaining known exposure of fossiliferous Pleistocene gravels along the River Avon . In conjunction with other sites within the wider area , they have aided the development of a scientific understanding of the history of early glaciation within South West England . 
 At Horseshoe Bend , Shirehampton the wooded cliff and a narrow salt marsh are supported by rocks of Devonian sandstone and Carboniferous limestone , overlain by with Triassic Dolomitic conglomerate . The site 's principal interest and the reason for its designation as an SSSI is the presence of a population of the True Service @-@ tree ( Sorbus domestica ) growing on the cliffs . This tree is nationally rare in Britain , and this site hosts the largest known population in England . Other notable species of Sorbus here are the whitebeams Sorbus <unk> and Sorbus anglica , both of which are also nationally rare in Britain . The nationally scarce Large @-@ leaved Lime ( Tilia <unk> ) also occurs , and herbs include Field garlic ( Allium <unk> ) and Pale St. John 's @-@ wort ( Hypericum montanum ) . The saltmarsh vegetation , which lies at the base of the cliff , is predominantly made up of Sea Aster ( Aster <unk> ) and English <unk> ( <unk> anglica ) . There are however two nationally scarce vascular plant species here as well – Slender Hare 's @-@ ear ( <unk> <unk> ) and Long @-@ stalked <unk> ( Atriplex longipes ) . 
 The tidal reaches of the River Avon provide habitat for waterbirds , with 64 species having been recorded up to 2004 , including 21 species of shorebird , and 13 species of gull . 
 = = History = = 
 The distribution of archaeological finds suggests that the western end of the river between Bath and Avonmouth formed a border between the Dobunni and Durotriges during the late Iron Age , prior to the Roman conquest of Britain . Further east , between Bath and what is now Wiltshire , it may also have formed a border of the territory ruled by the Belgae . After the Roman occupation the river formed a boundary between the lands of the Hwicce ( which became Mercia ) and the kingdom of Wessex . 
 The river Avon had been navigable from Bristol to Bath during the early years of the 13th century but construction of mills on the river forced its closure . The floodplain of the Avon , on which the city centre of Bath is built , has an altitude of about 59 ft ( 18 m ) above sea level . The river , once an unnavigable series of braided streams broken up by swamps and ponds , has been managed by weirs into a single channel . Periodic flooding , which shortened the life of many buildings in the lowest part of the city , was normal until major flood control works were completed in the 1970s . 
 The Bristol Avon Navigation , which runs the 15 miles ( 24 km ) from the Kennet and Avon Canal at Hanham Lock to the Bristol Channel at Avonmouth , was constructed between 1724 and 1727 , following legislation passed by Queen Anne , by a company of proprietors and the engineer John Hore of Newbury . The first cargo of ' Deal boards , Pig @-@ Lead and Meal ' arrived in Bath in December 1727 . It is now administered by the Canal & River Trust . 
 Throughout Bristol 's history the Avon Gorge has been an important transport route , carrying the River Avon , major roads and two railways . The Bristol Channel and Avon estuary have a very high tidal range of 15 metres ( 49 ft ) , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada ; and the gorge is relatively narrow and meandering , making it notoriously difficult to navigate . Several vessels have grounded in the gorge including the SS Demerara soon after her launch in 1851 , the schooner Gipsy in 1878 , the steam tug Black Eagle in 1861 and the Llandaff City . 
 In 1877 Halfpenny Bridge , a pedestrian toll bridge , crossing the river from Bath Spa railway station to Widcombe collapsed with the loss of about 10 lives amongst a large crowd going to the Bath and West Agricultural show . 
 The Avon has flooded several times in its recorded history . These floods include the one in 1799 / 1800 damaging Pulteney Bridge . Various points along the river including the valley around Freshford are at risk of fluvial flooding , as a result of sediment entering the river and narrowing the channel . To help cope with this some areas on the banks of the river are designated as a functional floodplain to cope with increased flow volumes . The potential changes to weather patterns as a result of climate change suggest that further measures are likely to be needed to protect the population from flooding risk . A tidal surge , combined with high water levels from the flooding of the surrounding area caused flooding in the city of Bristol .

 = New York State Route 205 = 
 New York State Route 205 ( NY 205 ) is a north – south state highway in central Otsego County , New York , in the United States . It extends for 23 @.@ 24 miles ( 37 @.@ 40 km ) from Interstate 88 ( I @-@ 88 ) exit 13 near the city of Oneonta to a junction with NY 28 in the town of Otsego . The latter junction also marks the east end of a 2 @.@ 1 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 4 km ) overlap between NY 205 and NY 80 , from where NY 80 heads southeast to follow NY 28 to Cooperstown . NY 205 is a two @-@ lane highway for its entire length and passes through the towns of Laurens and Hartwick . 
 NY 205 originally began at NY 23 northwest of Oneonta when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . The route originally followed local , substandard roads surrounding Otego Creek ; however , it was gradually moved onto its modern alignment over the course of the 1930s . It was officially extended southward from West Oneonta to connect to I @-@ 88 in 1970 ; however , it was not extended southward in reality until the mid @-@ 1970s . The extension created a short overlap with NY 23 west of the city . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 205 begins at exit 13 off I @-@ 88 just north of the Susquehanna River in the town of Oneonta . The two @-@ lane route heads northwestward from the exit , crossing the Interstate Highway and passing north of an office park built up alongside the freeway . Another overpass brings NY 205 over the Delaware and Hudson Railway and leads to an intersection with NY 7 ( Oneida Street ) , the main east – west surface road through the city of Oneonta . Past NY 7 , the route turns northward , serving the National Soccer Hall of Fame and another office park prior to crossing County Route 8 ( CR 8 , named Country Club Road ) . NY 205 continues on , passing through a residential area adjacent to Oneonta County Club and intersecting with NY 23 ( Chestnut Street ) at the club 's eastern edge . NY 23 turns north at the junction , overlapping with NY 205 for about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the outskirts of the town . 
 While NY 23 forks to the northwest to serve West Oneonta , NY 205 continues to run northward along the east side of Otego Creek through a rural section of Otsego County . It soon enters the town of Laurens , where it connects to CR 11A ( Water Street ) east of the village of Laurens . The short east – west county road is the only connection between NY 205 and the village , which is located on CR 11 , a parallel route to NY 205 on the western bank of Otego Creek . NY 205 and CR 11 continue northeastward , following loosely parallel alignments to the hamlet of Mount Vision in the northern part of the town . In Mount Vision , NY 205 ducks northwest at an intersection with CR 46 and meets CR 11B ( Mill Street ) , another connector between CR 11 and NY 205 , near the Mount Vision Cemetery . 
 After leaving Mount Vision , the two roads parallel each other into the town of Hartwick , where both intersect with another highway crossing Otego Creek , CR 11D . The roads enter the hamlet of Jones Crossing , intersecting with another crossroad , the locally maintained Jones Crossing Road . In the rural backdrop north of Jones Crossing , NY 205 intersects with CR 45 's western terminus . The parallel alignments of NY 205 and CR 11 end a short distance to the north in the hamlet of Hartwick as CR 11 enters the community on the east – west Main Street and intersects NY 205 in the hamlet 's center . CR 11 leaves NY 205 for good outside of Hartwick , continuing on a generally easterly track toward Cooperstown , while NY 205 passes Hartwick Town Park and crosses over Otego Creek as it heads northward into the town of Otsego . 
 In Otsego , NY 205 continues to run through mostly undeveloped areas to a junction with NY 80 . NY 205 turns eastward here to follow NY 80 while NY 205 's former northward right @-@ of @-@ way continues as a town highway named Raymond Fish Road . The two state routes initially head southeastward for roughly 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) ; however , they soon curve to the northeast as they descend into a valley surrounding Oaks Creek , a tributary of the Susquehanna River . At the base of the valley , NY 80 and NY 205 meet NY 28 , the primary north – south road through the area . NY 205 terminates here while NY 80 heads southeastward along NY 28 , following the route through the hamlet of Oaksville toward Cooperstown . 
 = = History = = 
 NY 205 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to a series of substandard highways connecting the hamlets of West Oneonta and Oaksville . The route began at NY 23 northwest of Oneonta and followed what is now CR 11 and CR 11B north through the village of Laurens and along the west side of Otego Creek to Mount Vision , from where it continued to NY 80 over a highway along the east bank of the creek that ultimately became the basis for NY 205 's modern routing . At this point , NY 205 turned eastward , overlapping with NY 80 to connect to NY 28 at a junction just outside Oaksville and 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) northwest of Cooperstown . South of Hartwick , NY 205 ran adjacent to the Southern New York Railway , a scenic passenger and freight railroad that was once the corridor 's main transportation artery . 
 Work to replace or improve the existing roads began c . 1930 with the construction of a new highway between West Oneonta and modern CR 11A near Laurens that ran along the east side of Otego Creek . The new road was completed by 1932 as a realignment of NY 205 , as was an extension of the highway north to Mount Vision . As part of the change , NY 205 was altered between Mount Vision and Hartwick to use a series of highways along the west bank of the creek , specifically Angel Road , current CR 11 , and Weeks Road . In late 1932 , the section of NY 205 north of Hartwick was closed to traffic as part of a project to completely reconstruct the road . It was completed and reopened c . 1934 . The eastern creekside highway between Mount Vision and Hartwick was upgraded c . 1938 ; as a result , NY 205 was rerouted once again to follow the improved road . 
 The reconstruction of NY 205 transformed the road into the main north – south connection between West Oneonta and Oaksville . At the same time , the parallel Southern New York Railway had become unprofitable as the highways running alongside the track had become more appealing to shippers and travelers than the railroad itself . In 1940 , the railroad abandoned the section of its line between West Oneonta and Jordanville , Herkimer County . The track ran alongside state routes for most of its length , and the presence of NY 205 and NY 167 was noted as a contributing factor to the line 's demise in the railroad 's abandonment petition to the Interstate Commerce Commission . 
 On January 1 , 1970 , NY 205 was officially extended southward to meet I @-@ 88 at what is now exit 13 . In reality , however , NY 205 continued to begin at NY 23 for most of the early 1970s as all of I @-@ 88 had yet to be built . The extension finally materialized c . 1974 following the completion of I @-@ 88 in the vicinity of Oneonta . The newly extended NY 205 connected to the freeway by way of a 0 @.@ 7 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 1 km ) overlap with NY 23 and a new 1 @.@ 4 @-@ mile ( 2 @.@ 3 km ) highway linking NY 23 to an interchange with I @-@ 88 at the Oneonta city line .

 = Nightshade ( 1985 video game ) = 
 Nightshade is an action video game developed and published by Ultimate Play The Game . It was first released for the ZX Spectrum in 1985 , and was then ported to the Amstrad CPC and BBC Micro later that year . It was also ported to the MSX exclusively in Japan in 1986 . In the game , the player assumes the role of a knight who sets out to destroy four demons in a plague @-@ infested village . 
 The game features flip @-@ screen and isometric gameplay , in similar vein to its predecessors , Knight Lore and Alien 8 . In addition , Nightshade features an enhanced version of the Ultimate Play The Game 's Filmation game engine , branded Filmation II . The game received positive reviews upon release ; critics praised its gameplay traits , graphics and colours , however one critic was divided over its perceived similarities to its predecessors . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The game is presented in an isometric format . The player assumes the role of a knight who enters the plague @-@ infested village of Nightshade to vanquish four demons who reside within . Additionally , all residents from the village have been transformed into vampires and other supernatural creatures . Contact with these monsters infects the knight , with repeated contact turning the character from white to yellow and then to green , which will lead to the character 's death . The knight may be hit up to three times by an enemy , however the fourth hit will result in a life being deducted . 
 The objective of the game is to locate and destroy four specific demons . Each demon is vulnerable to a particular object which must be collected by the player : a hammer , a Bible , a crucifix and an hourglass . Once the four items have been collected , the player must track down a specific demon and cast the correct item at it in order to destroy it . Once all four demons have been destroyed , the game will end . In order to defend against other enemies such as vampires and monsters , the player can arm themselves with " antibodies " , which take the appearance of maces . Antibodies can be found in houses around the village , and will slowly deplete once used by the player . Other collectible items include extra lives and boots , the latter of which enables the player character to run at a faster speed . 
 = = Background and release = = 
 Ashby Computers and Graphics was founded by brothers Tim and Chris Stamper , along with Tim 's wife , Carol , from their headquarters in Ashby @-@ de @-@ la @-@ Zouch in 1982 . Under the trading name of Ultimate Play the Game , they began producing multiple video games for the ZX Spectrum throughout the early 1980s . The company were known for their reluctance to reveal details about their operations and upcoming projects . Little was known about their development process except that they used to work in separate teams ; one team would work on graphics whilst the other would concentrate on other aspects such as sound or programming . When a journalist reviewing Nightshade for Crash asked Tim and Chris Stamper what the object of the game was they responded : " oh , we can 't tell you that " . 
 The game was developed with the isometric projection game engine known as Filmation II , an upgraded version of the Filmation engine . The Filmation engine was created by the Stamper brothers to portray 3D imagery . Filmation II used an image masking technique that drew and filled holes in the background , allowing the game to create composite structures out of pixelated drawings without visual overlay , despite the limitations platforms such as the ZX Spectrum offered . Nightshade was first released in the United Kingdom for the ZX Spectrum in 1985 , and was then ported to the Amstrad CPC and BBC Micro later that year . It was also ported to the MSX exclusively in Japan in 1986 .

 The game received positive reviews upon release . Chris Bourne of Sinclair User praised the game 's new graphics system , opining that it was " wonderfully " detailed and " juiced up " in contrast to its predecessors , Knight Lore and Alien 8 . A reviewer writing for Computer and Video Games praised the graphics as " great " and stated that its sound effects were " up to standard " considering the " dumb " ZX Spectrum . Philippa Irving of Crash thought that the visuals and use of colours were " stunning " and up to Ultimate Play The Game 's " usual standards " , however she did notice a few instances of attribute clash . A reviewer writing for Computer Gamer asserted that the graphics were " as good as ever " , however they admitted that the game seemed " lacking " in comparison to Ultimate Play The Game 's most recent releases . Chris Jenkins of Popular Computing Weekly opined that the game 's interior visuals looked like " featureless squares " , however he admitted that the game 's background drops were more detailed . 
 The gameplay was also praised by reviewers . Bourne opined that the game was well @-@ paced in similar vein to arcade @-@ style games , however he noted " a sense of déjà vu " with the game 's concept , stating that the developer 's games were starting to " wear thin " . The reviewer from Computer and Video Games appreciated Nightshade 's " nice touches " , summarising that it was an instant classic from Ultimate Play The Game . Irving criticised the lack of instructions or hints that came with the game , and stated that Nightshade did not set new standards with programming , unlike Knight Lore and Alien 8 . However , Irving admitted that the game was still another " technically brilliant " game . The reviewer from Computer Gamer enjoyed the wide range of gameplay elements , stating that it was enough to hold their attention for hours . A reviewer from Home Computing Weekly stated that the gameplay was not as addictive as Knight Lore or Alien 8 due to the game 's lack of obstacles . Jenkins praised the game 's use of its new engine , Filmation II , stating that it was ahead of " everything else " on the ZX Spectrum . 
 = SM U @-@ 32 ( Austria @-@ Hungary ) = 
 SM U @-@ 32 or U @-@ XXXII was a U @-@ 27 class U @-@ boat or submarine for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . U @-@ 32 , built by the Hungarian firm of Ganz Danubius at Fiume , was launched in May 1917 and commissioned in June . 
 U @-@ 32 had a single hull and was just over 121 feet ( 37 m ) in length . She displaced nearly 265 metric tons ( 261 long tons ) when surfaced and over 300 metric tons ( 295 long tons ) when submerged . Her two diesel engines moved her at up to 9 knots ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) on the surface , while her twin electric motors propelled her at up to 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ; 8 @.@ 6 mph ) while underwater . She was armed with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry a load of up to four torpedoes . She was also equipped with a 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) deck gun and a machine gun . 
 In her service career U @-@ 32 hit five ships of 6 @,@ 788 gross register tons ( GRT ) , sinking four and damaging one . At Pola at war 's end , the boat was handed over to Italy and scrapped in 1920 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Austria @-@ Hungary 's U @-@ boat fleet was largely obsolete at the outbreak of World War I. The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy satisfied its most urgent needs by purchasing five Type UB I submarines that comprised the U @-@ 10 class from Germany , by raising and recommissioning the sunken French submarine Curie as U @-@ 14 , and by building four submarines of the U @-@ 20 class that were based on the 1911 Danish Havmanden class . 
 After these steps alleviated their most urgent needs , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915 . The Germans were reluctant to allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro @-@ Hungarian construction , but were willing to sell plans for up to six of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria @-@ Hungary . The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen . 
 U @-@ 32 displaced 264 metric tons ( 260 long tons ) surfaced and 301 metric tons ( 296 long tons ) submerged . She had a single hull with saddle tanks , and was 121 feet 1 inch ( 36 @.@ 91 m ) long with a beam of 14 feet 4 inches ( 4 @.@ 37 m ) and a draft of 12 feet 2 inches ( 3 @.@ 71 m ) . For propulsion , she had two shafts , twin diesel engines of 270 bhp ( 200 kW ) for surface running , and twin electric motors of 280 shp ( 210 kW ) for submerged travel . She was capable of 9 knots ( 16 @.@ 7 km / h ) while surfaced and 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ) while submerged . Although there is no specific notation of a range for U @-@ 32 in Conway 's All the World 's Fighting Ships , 1906 – 1921 , the German UB II boats , upon which the U @-@ 27 class was based , had a range of over 6 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 000 km ) at 5 knots ( 9 @.@ 3 km / h ) surfaced , and 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ) at 4 knots ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ) submerged . U @-@ 27 @-@ class boats were designed for a crew of 23 – 24 . 
 U @-@ 32 was armed with two 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes and could carry a complement of four torpedoes . She was also equipped with a 75 mm / 26 ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) deck gun and an 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun . 
 After intricate political negotiations to allocate production of the class between Austrian and Hungarian firms , U @-@ 27 was ordered from Ganz Danubius on 12 October 1915 . She was laid down on 18 July 1916 at Fiume and launched on 11 May 1917 . 
 = = Service career = = 
 After launching , the U @-@ boat made her way to Pola , where , on 29 April 1917 , SM U @-@ 32 was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy under the command of Linienschiffleutnant Gaston Vio . Vio , a 30 @-@ year @-@ old native of Fiume , was a first @-@ time submarine commander . Vio and U @-@ 32 began their first patrol on 3 July when they sailed from Pola for a Mediterranean deployment . East of Manfredonia two days later , an enemy submarine launched a spread of three torpedoes at U @-@ 32 but the Austro @-@ Hungarian submarine avoided them all . Two days later , U @-@ 32 had an at @-@ sea rendezvous with the German U @-@ boat UC @-@ 52 . The following day , Vio failed to hit a steamer in the Gulf of Taranto . 
 On 15 July , U @-@ 32 launched torpedoes against the British steamer Incemore . Hit 225 nautical miles ( 417 km ) east @-@ southeast of Malta , the 3 @,@ 060 @-@ ton ship was en route from Marseilles to Salonika when she was attacked . Incemore was damaged but continued on her way ; no one aboard the steamer was killed in the attack . The U @-@ boat docked in Cattaro to end her first patrol four days later . 
 The next Mediterranean patrol for U @-@ 32 began on 14 August . Sister boat U @-@ 40 met up with her at sea on 29 August . Two days later , U @-@ 32 stopped a Greek sailing vessel , Agios Georgios and examined her , but let her go on her way . Vio put in his boat at Cattaro on 4 September , ending the boat 's second patrol . On 12 October , U @-@ 32 departed Cattaro for Durazzo , arriving the next day . On the 18th , the submarine departed there for Brindisi , screening for a sortie by the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruiser Helgoland and a destroyer group . When U @-@ 32 reached Brindisi the following day , she was greeted by Italian torpedo boats which dropped five depth charges over her . After putting in at Cattaro on the 19th , she quickly departed for Pola to repair damage to her conning tower . 
 After two months of repairs at Pola , U @-@ 32 set out on 27 December but had to return with engine problems . She departed for the Mediterranean the following day and cruised between Alexandria and Malta , but returned to Cattaro in late January 1918 without success . Another patrol beginning in late February was similarly fruitless and U @-@ 32 returned to Cattaro empty @-@ handed again on 26 March . 
 While at Cattaro , Vio was relieved of command on 24 April and replaced by Linienschiffleutnant Otto Kasseroller , who had formerly been in command of U @-@ 2 . Kasseroller was a 31 @-@ year @-@ old Salzburg native . On 8 May , U @-@ 32 began her first cruise with Kasseroller at the helm . Five days out , the Greek sailing ship Julia was stopped near Cape Matapan . After allowing Julia 's crew to board a lifeboat , Kasseroller sank Julia with fire from the U @-@ boat 's deck gun . After the 48 @-@ ton ship was sunk , U @-@ 32 towed the lifeboat close to the shore . As a result , none of the Greek ship 's crew died in the attack . 
 A week later , on 20 May , U @-@ 32 sank two more Greek sailing ships : the 58 @-@ ton Agios Dionysios , and the 30 @-@ ton Angeliki . The following day Kasseroller torpedoed a British steamer . Chatham , of 3 @,@ 592 gross register tons ( GRT ) , was headed from Karachi to Marseilles with grain and onions when U @-@ 32 sent her down 80 nautical miles ( 150 km ) from Cape Matapan . Continuing her most successful patrol , U @-@ 32 met with the German UB @-@ 48 off the coast of Africa on 3 June , but returned to Cattaro on the 6th . 
 During the remainder of June and into July , U @-@ 32 patrolled in the Adriatic out of Cattaro , calling at the Albanian ports of Durazzo and San Giovanni di Medua . Continuing this same duty into August , U @-@ 32 was forced to crash dive to avoid an attack by another submarine on 19 August . Five days later an airplane attacked the U @-@ boat , dropping a total of five bombs . After the attack , U @-@ 32 made her way to Cattaro and , in early September , headed back to Pola . After making a stop at Fiume , the submarine docked at Pola on 13 September and remained there through the end of the war . She was ceded to Italy as a war reparation , and scrapped in 1920 . In total , U @-@ 32 sank four ships and damaged one other ship , hitting a combined total of 6 @,@ 788 GRT .

 = Structural alignment = 
 Structural alignment attempts to establish homology between two or more polymer structures based on their shape and three @-@ dimensional conformation . This process is usually applied to protein tertiary structures but can also be used for large RNA molecules . In contrast to simple structural superposition , where at least some equivalent residues of the two structures are known , structural alignment requires no a priori knowledge of equivalent positions . Structural alignment is a valuable tool for the comparison of proteins with low sequence similarity , where evolutionary relationships between proteins cannot be easily detected by standard sequence alignment techniques . Structural alignment can therefore be used to imply evolutionary relationships between proteins that share very little common sequence . However , caution should be used in using the results as evidence for shared evolutionary ancestry because of the possible confounding effects of convergent evolution by which multiple unrelated amino acid sequences converge on a common tertiary structure . 
 Structural alignments can compare two sequences or multiple sequences . Because these alignments rely on information about all the query sequences ' three @-@ dimensional conformations , the method can only be used on sequences where these structures are known . These are usually found by X @-@ ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy . It is possible to perform a structural alignment on structures produced by structure prediction methods . Indeed , evaluating such predictions often requires a structural alignment between the model and the true known structure to assess the model 's quality . Structural alignments are especially useful in analyzing data from structural genomics and proteomics efforts , and they can be used as comparison points to evaluate alignments produced by purely sequence @-@ based bioinformatics methods . 
 The outputs of a structural alignment are a superposition of the atomic coordinate sets and a minimal root mean square deviation ( RMSD ) between the structures . The RMSD of two aligned structures indicates their divergence from one another . Structural alignment can be complicated by the existence of multiple protein domains within one or more of the input structures , because changes in relative orientation of the domains between two structures to be aligned can artificially inflate the RMSD . 
 = = Data produced by structural alignment = = 
 The minimum information produced from a successful structural alignment is a set of superposed three @-@ dimensional coordinates for each input structure . ( Note that one input element may be fixed as a reference and therefore its superposed coordinates do not change . ) The fitted structures can be used to calculate mutual RMSD values , as well as other more sophisticated measures of structural similarity such as the global distance test ( <unk> , the metric used in CASP ) . The structural alignment also implies a corresponding one @-@ dimensional sequence alignment from which a sequence identity , or the percentage of residues that are identical between the input structures , can be calculated as a measure of how closely the two sequences are related . 
 = = Types of comparisons = = 
 Because protein structures are composed of amino acids whose side chains are linked by a common protein backbone , a number of different possible subsets of the atoms that make up a protein <unk> can be used in producing a structural alignment and calculating the corresponding RMSD values . When aligning structures with very different sequences , the side chain atoms generally are not taken into account because their identities differ between many aligned residues . For this reason it is common for structural alignment methods to use by default only the backbone atoms included in the peptide bond . For simplicity and efficiency , often only the alpha carbon positions are considered , since the peptide bond has a minimally variant planar conformation . Only when the structures to be aligned are highly similar or even identical is it meaningful to align side @-@ chain atom positions , in which case the RMSD reflects not only the conformation of the protein backbone but also the <unk> states of the side chains . Other comparison criteria that reduce noise and bolster positive matches include secondary structure assignment , native contact maps or residue interaction patterns , measures of side chain packing , and measures of hydrogen bond retention . 
 = = = Structural superposition = = = 
 The most basic possible comparison between protein structures makes no attempt to align the input structures and requires a precalculated alignment as input to determine which of the residues in the sequence are intended to be considered in the RMSD calculation . Structural superposition is commonly used to compare multiple conformations of the same protein ( in which case no alignment is necessary , since the sequences are the same ) and to evaluate the quality of alignments produced using only sequence information between two or more sequences whose structures are known . This method traditionally uses a simple least @-@ squares fitting algorithm , in which the optimal rotations and translations are found by minimizing the sum of the squared distances among all structures in the superposition . More recently , maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods have greatly increased the accuracy of the estimated rotations , translations , and covariance matrices for the superposition . 
 Algorithms based on multidimensional rotations and modified quaternions have been developed to identify topological relationships between protein structures without the need for a predetermined alignment . Such algorithms have successfully identified canonical folds such as the four @-@ helix bundle . The <unk> method is sufficiently extensible to correct for relative domain rotations and other structural pitfalls . 
 = = Algorithmic complexity = = 
 = = = Optimal solution = = = 
 The optimal " threading " of a protein sequence onto a known structure and the production of an optimal multiple sequence alignment have been shown to be NP @-@ complete . However , this does not imply that the structural alignment problem is NP @-@ complete . Strictly speaking , an optimal solution to the protein structure alignment problem is only known for certain protein structure similarity measures , such as the measures used in protein structure prediction experiments , <unk> _ TS and <unk> . These measures can be rigorously optimized using an algorithm capable of maximizing the number of atoms in two proteins that can be superimposed under a predefined distance cutoff . Unfortunately , the algorithm for optimal solution is not practical , since its running time depends not only on the lengths but also on the intrinsic geometry of input proteins . 
 = = = Approximate solution = = = 
 Approximate polynomial @-@ time algorithms for structural alignment that produce a family of " optimal " solutions within an approximation parameter for a given scoring function have been developed . Although these algorithms theoretically classify the approximate protein structure alignment problem as " tractable " , they are still computationally too expensive for large @-@ scale protein structure analysis . As a consequence , practical algorithms that converge to the global solutions of the alignment , given a scoring function , do not exist . Most algorithms are , therefore , heuristic , but algorithms that guarantee the convergence to at least local <unk> of the scoring functions , and are practical , have been developed . 
 = = Representation of structures = = 
 Protein structures have to be represented in some coordinate @-@ independent space to make them comparable . This is typically achieved by constructing a sequence @-@ to @-@ sequence matrix or series of matrices that encompass comparative metrics : rather than absolute distances relative to a fixed coordinate space . An intuitive representation is the distance matrix , which is a two @-@ dimensional matrix containing all pairwise distances between some subset of the atoms in each structure ( such as the alpha carbons ) . The matrix increases in dimensionality as the number of structures to be simultaneously aligned increases . Reducing the protein to a coarse metric such as secondary structure elements ( <unk> ) or structural fragments can also produce sensible alignments , despite the loss of information from discarding distances , as noise is also discarded . Choosing a representation to facilitate computation is critical to developing an efficient alignment mechanism . 
 = = Methods = = 
 Structural alignment techniques have been used in comparing individual structures or sets of structures as well as in the production of " all @-@ to @-@ all " comparison databases that measure the divergence between every pair of structures present in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) . Such databases are used to classify proteins by their fold . 
 = = = DALI = = = 
 A common and popular structural alignment method is the DALI , or distance alignment matrix method , which breaks the input structures into <unk> fragments and calculates a distance matrix by evaluating the contact patterns between successive fragments . Secondary structure features that involve residues that are contiguous in sequence appear on the matrix 's main diagonal ; other diagonals in the matrix reflect spatial contacts between residues that are not near each other in the sequence . When these diagonals are parallel to the main diagonal , the features they represent are parallel ; when they are perpendicular , their features are antiparallel . This representation is memory @-@ intensive because the features in the square matrix are symmetrical ( and thus redundant ) about the main diagonal . 
 When two proteins ' distance matrices share the same or similar features in approximately the same positions , they can be said to have similar folds with similar @-@ length loops connecting their secondary structure elements . DALI 's actual alignment process requires a similarity search after the two proteins ' distance matrices are built ; this is normally conducted via a series of overlapping <unk> of size 6x6 . <unk> matches are then reassembled into a final alignment via a standard score @-@ maximization algorithm — the original version of DALI used a Monte Carlo simulation to maximize a structural similarity score that is a function of the distances between putative corresponding atoms . In particular , more distant atoms within corresponding features are exponentially <unk> to reduce the effects of noise introduced by loop mobility , helix <unk> , and other minor structural variations . Because DALI relies on an all @-@ to @-@ all distance matrix , it can account for the possibility that structurally aligned features might appear in different orders within the two sequences being compared . 
 The DALI method has also been used to construct a database known as <unk> ( Fold classification based on Structure @-@ Structure alignment of Proteins , or Families of Structurally Similar Proteins ) in which all known protein structures are aligned with each other to determine their structural neighbors and fold classification . There is an searchable database based on DALI as well as a downloadable program and web search based on a standalone version known as <unk> . 
 = = = Combinatorial extension = = = 
 The combinatorial extension ( CE ) method is similar to DALI in that it too breaks each structure in the query set into a series of fragments that it then attempts to reassemble into a complete alignment . A series of pairwise combinations of fragments called aligned fragment pairs , or <unk> , are used to define a similarity matrix through which an optimal path is generated to identify the final alignment . Only <unk> that meet given criteria for local similarity are included in the matrix as a means of reducing the necessary search space and thereby increasing efficiency . A number of similarity metrics are possible ; the original definition of the CE method included only structural <unk> and inter @-@ residue distances but has since been expanded to include local environmental properties such as secondary structure , solvent exposure , hydrogen @-@ bonding patterns , and dihedral angles . 
 An alignment path is calculated as the optimal path through the similarity matrix by linearly progressing through the sequences and extending the alignment with the next possible high @-@ scoring AFP pair . The initial AFP pair that <unk> the alignment can occur at any point in the sequence matrix . Extensions then proceed with the next AFP that meets given distance criteria restricting the alignment to low gap sizes . The size of each AFP and the maximum gap size are required input parameters but are usually set to empirically determined values of 8 and 30 respectively . Like DALI and SSAP , CE has been used to construct an all @-@ to @-@ all fold classification database from the known protein structures in the PDB . 
 The RCSB PDB has recently released an updated version of CE and <unk> as part of the RCSB PDB Protein Comparison Tool . It provides a new variation of CE that can detect circular permutations in protein structures . 
 = = = SSAP = = = 
 The SSAP ( Sequential Structure Alignment Program ) method uses double dynamic programming to produce a structural alignment based on atom @-@ to @-@ atom vectors in structure space . Instead of the alpha carbons typically used in structural alignment , SSAP constructs its vectors from the beta carbons for all residues except glycine , a method which thus takes into account the <unk> state of each residue as well as its location along the backbone . SSAP works by first constructing a series of inter @-@ residue distance vectors between each residue and its nearest non @-@ contiguous neighbors on each protein . A series of matrices are then constructed containing the vector differences between neighbors for each pair of residues for which vectors were constructed . Dynamic programming applied to each resulting matrix determines a series of optimal local alignments which are then summed into a " summary " matrix to which dynamic programming is applied again to determine the overall structural alignment . 
 SSAP originally produced only pairwise alignments but has since been extended to multiple alignments as well . It has been applied in an all @-@ to @-@ all fashion to produce a hierarchical fold classification scheme known as CATH ( Class , Architecture , Topology , Homology ) , which has been used to construct the CATH Protein Structure Classification database . 
 = = Recent developments = = 
 Improvements in structural alignment methods constitute an active area of research , and new or modified methods are often proposed that are claimed to offer advantages over the older and more widely distributed techniques . A recent example , TM @-@ align , uses a novel method for weighting its distance matrix , to which standard dynamic programming is then applied . The weighting is proposed to accelerate the convergence of dynamic programming and correct for effects arising from alignment lengths . In a benchmarking study , TM @-@ align has been reported to improve in both speed and accuracy over DALI and CE . 
 However , as algorithmic improvements and computer performance have erased purely technical deficiencies in older approaches , it has become clear that there is no one universal criterion for the ' optimal ' structural alignment . TM @-@ align , for instance , is particularly robust in quantifying comparisons between sets of proteins with great disparities in sequence lengths , but it only indirectly captures hydrogen bonding or secondary structure order conservation which might be better metrics for alignment of evolutionarily related proteins . Thus recent developments have focused on optimizing particular attributes such as speed , quantification of scores , correlation to alternative gold standards , or tolerance of imperfection in structural data or ab initio structural models . An alternative methodology that is gaining popularity is to use the consensus of various methods to ascertain proteins structural similarities . 
 = = RNA structural alignment = = 
 Structural alignment techniques have traditionally been applied exclusively to proteins , as the primary biological macromolecules that assume characteristic three @-@ dimensional structures . However , large RNA molecules also form characteristic tertiary structures , which are mediated primarily by hydrogen bonds formed between base pairs as well as base stacking . Functionally similar noncoding RNA molecules can be especially difficult to extract from genomics data because structure is more strongly conserved than sequence in RNA as well as in proteins , and the more limited alphabet of RNA decreases the information content of any given nucleotide at any given position . 
 However , because of the increasing interest in RNA structures and because of the growth of the number of experimentally determined 3D RNA structures , few RNA structure similarity methods have been developed recently . One of those methods is , e.g. , <unk> which decomposes each RNA structure into smaller parts called general secondary structure units ( <unk> ) . <unk> are subsequently aligned and these partial alignments are merged into the final RNA structure alignment and scored . The method has been implemented into the <unk> webserver . 
 A recent method for pairwise structural alignment of RNA sequences with low sequence identity has been published and implemented in the program <unk> . However , this method is not truly analogous to protein structural alignment techniques because it computationally predicts the structures of the RNA input sequences rather than requiring experimentally determined structures as input . Although computational prediction of the protein folding process has not been particularly successful to date , RNA structures without pseudoknots can often be sensibly predicted using free energy @-@ based scoring methods that account for base pairing and stacking .

 Choosing a software tool for structural alignment can be a challenge due to the large variety of available packages that differ significantly in methodology and reliability . A partial solution to this problem was presented in and made publicly accessible through the <unk> webserver . A more complete list of currently available and freely distributed structural alignment software can be found in structural alignment software .

 = Frederick E. Morgan = 
 Lieutenant @-@ General Sir Frederick Edgworth Morgan KCB ( 5 February 1894 – 19 March 1967 ) was a senior officer of the British Army who fought in both world wars . He is best known as the chief of staff to the Supreme Allied Commander ( COSSAC ) , the original planner of Operation Overlord . 
 A graduate of the Royal Military Academy , Woolwich , Morgan was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery in 1913 . During the First World War he served on the Western Front as an artillery subaltern and staff officer . Afterwards he served two long tours with the British Army in India . 
 Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 , Morgan was promoted to brigadier and assumed command of the 1st Support Group of the 1st Armoured Division , which he led during the Battle of France . In May 1942 he became a lieutenant @-@ general and given command of I Corps . Morgan 's headquarters was designated Force 125 , and given the task of dealing with a German thrust through Spain to Gibraltar that never occurred . In March 1943 he was appointed chief of staff to the Supreme Allied Commander ( Designate ) , or COSSAC . As COSSAC he directed the planning for Operation Overlord . When General Dwight Eisenhower became Supreme Allied Commander , Major General Bedell Smith became chief of staff at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) , while Morgan became deputy chief of staff . 
 After the war , Morgan served as Chief of Operations for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration ( UNRRA ) in Germany until his position in Germany was eliminated following publication of " off the record " comments concerning incompetence and corruption within UNRRA , including diverting the resources of UNRRA to support of Zionist ambitions in Palestine . In 1951 , Morgan became Controller of Atomic Energy , and was present for Operation Hurricane , the first British atomic weapons tests at the Montebello Islands in 1952 . His position was abolished in 1954 with the creation of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority but he remained as Controller of Nuclear Weapons until 1956 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Morgan was born in Paddock Wood , Kent on 5 February 1894 , the eldest son among nine children of Frederick Beverley Morgan , a timber importer , and his wife Clare Elizabeth née Horrocks . He was raised at Mascall 's Manor . Paddock Wood . He commenced his education at <unk> , a private school in Tunbridge Wells in 1902 . At an early age it was decided that Frederick would become a British Army officer , and in 1907 he entered Clifton College , a school noted for its connections with the Royal Military Academy , Woolwich . At Clifton he played rugby and cricket , and served in the School Cadet Corps , which became the Officers ' Training Corps in 1908 . As a cadet sergeant , he was one of many who lined the route to Buckingham Palace for the Coronation of George V of the United Kingdom in 1911 . He eventually rose to the rank of second lieutenant . Morgan duly passed the entrance examination for Woolwich , which he entered in 1912 . 
 Morgan was commissioned second lieutenant in the Royal Artillery on 17 July 1913 , and joined 41st Battery , 42nd Brigade , Royal Field Artillery at Aldershot . He volunteered for service in India , and in January 1914 departed on the British @-@ India Steam Navigation Company troopship Rewa , joining the 84th Battery , 11th Brigade , Royal Field Artillery , which was stationed in Jabalpur . 
 = = First World War = = 
 Following the outbreak of the First World War , Morgan 's battery departed for the Western Front in October 1914 as part of the 3rd ( Lahore ) Division . Morgan suffered a near @-@ miss from a German 5 @.@ 9 @-@ inch gun which blew him into the air and buried him in a shell hole , and he was evacuated to hospital in Boulogne with shell shock . He was granted a short sick leave in England only to be present when news reached his family that his brother had been killed in action . On returning to the front , Morgan became aide @-@ de @-@ camp to Brigadier General Edward Spencer Hoare @-@ Nairne , the commander of the Lahore Divisional Artillery . The artillery remained on the Western Front when the bulk of the division departed for the Mesopotamian campaign . As it took longer to train artillery than infantry , the Lahore divisional artillery acted in turn as the artillery of the 2nd Canadian Division , 3rd Canadian Division , 4th Australian Division and finally the 4th Canadian Division until their own artillery was sufficiently trained to take over . 
 Morgan became a staff captain in February 1916 , and was promoted to the temporary rank of captain in May 1916 . The Lahore divisional artillery was broken up in mid @-@ 1917 and Morgan was posted to the 42nd ( East Lancashire ) Division as a staff captain . On 15 August 1917 , he married Marjorie Cecile <unk> , the daughter of Colonel Thomas du <unk> <unk> of the Royal Army Medical Corps . The couple had met on board the Rewa en route to India in 1914 . Their marriage produced two daughters and a son . During the Hundred Days Offensive he served as brigade major of the 42nd Divisional Artillery . During the war he was twice mentioned in dispatches , on 15 May 1917 , and again on 5 July 1919 . 
 = = Between the wars = = 
 In 1919 , Morgan volunteered for a six @-@ year tour of India and joined the 118th Field Battery , 26th Field Brigade , at <unk> , where it was forming and training for service in the subcontinent . Later that year the brigade moved to its new station at Jhansi . After three years Morgan was posted to Attock , where he commanded the Divisional Ammunition Column . In 1924 he accepted a temporary staff posting as Deputy Assistant Adjutant @-@ General ( <unk> ) of Major @-@ General Sir Herbert Uniacke 's 1st ( Peshawar ) Division at Murree . This was followed in 1925 by a year 's secondment to the headquarters of Lieutenant @-@ General Sir Claud Jacob 's Northern Command , where Morgan helped plan and direct large @-@ scale manoeuvres . 
 Morgan returned to England in 1926 , and assumed command of the 22nd Heavy Battery . Equipped with a mixture of 9 @.@ 2 inch guns , 6 inch guns , 12 pounders and 6 pounders , it was responsible for the coastal defences of Weymouth , Dorset . Still a captain , Morgan hoped that his next career move would be to attend the Staff College , Camberley , having narrowly passed the entrance examination . Instead , he was offered a place at the Staff College , Quetta , requiring a return trip to India . Morgan 's classmates at Quetta in 1927 and 1928 included William Slim , John Crocker , Kenneth Anderson , David Cowan , George Alan Vasey and Tommy Burns . After graduation , Morgan was posted to the 70th Field Battery at Lucknow , and then was artillery staff officer at headquarters Western Command , under Brigadier Henry Karslake . When Karslake became major @-@ general , Royal Artillery , at GHQ India in 1931 , he brought Morgan to Delhi to serve with him as General Staff Officer ( Grade 2 ) . Morgan was finally promoted major in 1932 and brevet lieutenant @-@ colonel in 1934 . 
 Returning to England in 1934 , Morgan assumed command of the 4th Anti @-@ Aircraft Battery , which was deployed to Malta during the diplomatic crisis that accompanied the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 . He served in the War Office from 1936 to 1938 . Here he became increasingly disturbed at the lack of urgency that the government displayed in the face of a war that Morgan and his fellow staff officers felt was inevitable and imminent . That year he was promoted colonel and became General Staff Officer ( Grade 1 ) of the 3rd Division , in which Brigadier Bernard Montgomery commanded a brigade .

 = = = Battle of France = = = 
 In 1939 , Morgan was promoted brigadier and assumed command of the 1st Support Group of the 1st Armoured Division . When the 1st Support Group was shipped to France in May 1940 , following the outbreak of the Second World War , it had already been stripped of its two field artillery regiments and two infantry battalions . As a result , Morgan 's command included only a force of Royal Engineers and a Territorial battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers , which was in the process of converting to an anti @-@ aircraft / anti @-@ tank regiment and armed only with anti @-@ tank guns . His group was in no position to fulfil its normal role supporting the division 's armoured brigades and so was sent to reinforce 51st ( Highland ) Division south of the river Somme . During a confused retreat most of the Support Group was captured along with the 51st Division at Saint @-@ Valery @-@ en @-@ Caux but the remainder , including Morgan , got away and were evacuated to England . 
 The 1st Armoured Division was subsequently reformed , and became a mobile reserve in south eastern England . It was tasked with counter @-@ attacking an invading German army , and the 1st Support Group was given two Canadian infantry battalions for this purpose . In November 1940 Morgan was appointed Brigadier General Staff at II Corps , based in Norfolk . Morgan was promoted major @-@ general in 1941 and given command of the Devon and Cornwall County Division , a static formation created for coastal defence . In October he assumed command of the 55th ( West Lancashire ) Infantry Division , a second line territorial formation . 
 In May 1942 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant @-@ general and given command of the I Corps District , which included Lincolnshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire . In October of that year his headquarters became a mobile formation , was redesignated I Corps and placed under Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower . Morgan 's corps headquarters was designated Force 125 . It was given command of the 1st and 4th Divisions , and the task of dealing with a German thrust through Spain to Gibraltar . 
 This operation proved unnecessary , and Morgan 's two divisions were sent to North Africa , while he was directed to plan the invasion of Sardinia . In time this was abandoned in favour of the Allied invasion of Sicily . I Corps headquarters remained in the United Kingdom the whole time , located at 1 Cumberland near Marble Arch , with the headquarters mess in the Lyons Marble Arch Corner House . However , it gained considerable experience in operational planning . Morgan was appointed a Commander of the Order of the Bath on 2 June 1943 . 
 = = = COSSAC = = = 
 At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943 , the Combined Chiefs of Staff agreed to establish a staff to plan operations in north west Europe in 1944 . It was envisaged that the Supreme Allied Commander would be British , and the usual practice was for the commander and the chief of staff to be of the same nationality , so it was decided to appoint a British officer for the role of chief of staff to the Supreme Allied Commander ( Designate ) ( COSSAC ) , with an American deputy . In March 1943 Morgan became COSSAC . Brigadier General Ray Barker became his American deputy . Initially , Morgan 's staff consisted of an aide , two batmen and a driver with a car purloined from I Corps headquarters . Morgan established his headquarters in Norfolk House at 31 St James 's Square . However , by October 1943 , it was clearly too small for COSSAC needs , which called for accommodation for a staff of 320 officers and 600 other ranks . In November and December part of the staff moved to the South Rotunda , a bombproof structure that had originally been fitted up as an anti @-@ invasion base , which was connected to the various ministries by the Whitehall Tunnel . Other staff were accommodated at 80 Pall Mall . 
 COSSAC was charged with planning three operations : Operation Cockade , a deception operation to keep German forces pinned to the coast ; Operation Rankin , a plan for measures to be taken in the case of a sudden German collapse ; and Operation Overlord , a plan for a full @-@ scale assault on north western Europe . Morgan and his staff worked on the Overlord plan throughout June and the first half of July 1943 . He presented it to the Chiefs of Staff Committee on 15 July . The plan set forth in detail the conditions under which the assault could be made , the area where a landing would be feasible , and the means by which a lodgement on the continent would be developed . 
 On 28 July , a group of the COSSAC staff , headed by Barker , travelled to Washington D.C. to present the Overlord plan to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , and to confer with the U.S. War Department about the troop basis for the operation and issues related to its civil affairs and logistics aspects . Missions were also exchanged with Eisenhower 's Allied Force Headquarters in Algiers to coordinate the plans of offensive action in the Mediterranean and north western Europe in 1944 . In October and November , Morgan went to Washington , to discuss the operation with the Combined Chiefs of Staff , accompanied only by Major General Nevil Brownjohn and an aide . Morgan met with General George Marshall , who instructed him to proceed with planning on the basis that Marshall would be Supreme Allied Commander and Morgan his chief of staff . Morgan met with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House . Roosevelt turned down Morgan 's request for the services of Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle , Jr. to assist with civil affairs , and also cast doubt on whether Marshall could be spared to become Supreme Allied Commander . While in the United States Morgan visited the Gettysburg Battlefield and the training camps at Camp Carrabelle , Fort Benning , Camp Mackall and Fort Bragg . 
 The Combined Chiefs of Staff authorised Morgan to issue orders in the name of the Supreme Allied Commander to the Commanders in Chief of the Air , Naval and Land Forces , even though they outranked him . When Montgomery was appointed Commander in Chief Land Forces for the invasion , in December 1943 , he declared that Morgan 's original plans were unworkable ; they had originally been limited by the availability of landing craft , but Montgomery insisted it would require more men attacking over a wider front . Ultimately , more landing craft were obtained and the invasion was scaled up to Montgomery 's satisfaction , at the cost of a month 's delay and a reduction in the Southern France operation . However , all the key features of Morgan 's plan remained ; the choice of Normandy as the assault area , the use of Mulberry harbours , the deployment of American forces on the right and British on the left , the use of airborne troops to cover the flanks , and some form of diversionary operation in Southern France . 
 = = = SHAEF = = = 
 When Eisenhower was appointed Supreme Allied Commander the COSSAC team was absorbed into SHAEF . Eisenhower brought his chief of staff for Allied Forces Headquarters , Major General Bedell Smith , and moved the headquarters to Bushey Park . Morgan was offered command of a corps in Italy but declined in favour of becoming one of Smith 's three deputies . His responsibilities covered Intelligence and Operations . Morgan coordinated the work of various SHAEF divisions and deputised for Bedell Smith when he was absent . 
 Morgan was also called upon on occasion to deal with Montgomery , with whom his professional relationship as deputy chief of staff was similar to that before the war when Montgomery was a brigade commander . On one occasion Morgan was summoned to Smith 's office to find him white with rage at a telephone receiver . " That 's your bloody marshal on the other end of that , " Smith explained . " I can 't talk to him any more . Now you go on . " " As the campaign progressed , " Morgan later wrote , " it became more difficult for us British at SHAEF to provide explanation , as we were continually called upon to do , for the attitude and behaviour of the British authorities as exemplified by their chosen representative in the field . " Senior British officers at SHAEF , notably Morgan , Kenneth Strong and Jock Whiteley remained loyal to Eisenhower . This cast a pall over their careers after the war , when Montgomery became Chief of the Imperial General Staff . 
 After the war Smith described Morgan as his British alter ego , " a man I wouldn 't willingly have dispensed with " . Morgan served in this role until SHAEF was dissolved in June 1945 . He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath ( KCB ) in August 1944 " in recognition of distinguished services in connection with the invasion of Normandy " . The United States government awarded him the Legion of Merit in April 1945 , and the Distinguished Service Medal in 1948 for his services .

 = = = UNRRA = = = 
 In September 1945 Morgan became the Chief of Operations for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration ( UNRRA ) in Germany . He applied his energy and planning skills to the problem of providing relief to millions of refugees and displaced persons in Europe in the wake of the war . However he became frustrated with the inefficiency of the United Nations organisation . 
 Events in the British – Zionist conflict in the British Mandate for Palestine made Morgan feel conflicted between his role in assisting Jewish refugees at UNRRA , whom he regarded as special victims of the Nazis for being persecuted solely for their race , and supporting British policy as a British Army officer . In January 1946 he created an uproar by claiming at a press conference that there was a secret Zionist organisation that was attempting to facilitate an " exodus " of Jewish people from Europe to a new state in Palestine with Soviet encouragement . He later wrote : 
 I had been able to piece together a reasonably comprehensive picture of the way in which the UNRRA set up was being most skilfully used to promote what was nothing less than a Zionist campaign of aggression in Palestine . In defiance of the prohibition by the British Mandatory power , reluctant as ever to employ decisive means , the admirably organised Zionist command was employing any and every means of forcing immigration into the country irrespective of the hardship and sufferings of the immigrants , few of whom seemed to have spontaneous enthusiasm for the Zionist cause . The whole project evidently had Russian connivance , if not actual support , since its success would conduce to the elimination of British authority in a vital area of the Middle East . 
 A correspondent reported that Morgan made " casual observations based on what he saw ... but the controversial remarks were taken out of the context and put together by correspondents . " UNRRA expected that Morgan would offer his resignation but he did not do so . An attempt to clarify his position " off the record " failed , and Morgan 's position in Germany was eliminated by UNRRA Director Fiorello La Guardia . 
 Morgan 's statements caused a furore in the press , which portrayed them as anti @-@ Semitic and distasteful . However , Morgan 's comments were factual , based on military intelligence . It was reported at the time in Time magazine that : " Observers here [ in Berlin ] ... are positive of [ Morgan 's ] sincerity , and know he had no intention of feeding the fires of anti @-@ Semitic propaganda . " Archibald MacLeish , a former Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs , stated that when the press had finished with Sir Frederick , " .. the sum total effect was a lie and a disastrous and evil lie . This brings up the question of journalistic standards . In a world as closely integrated as this one is , the question must be asked : what is the standard of truth in journalism ? When the journalist is dealing with an inflammatory subject and so reports it that verbally his story is true , but the overall effect is false , are the standards of truth satisfied ? " 
 With his military background , Morgan was appalled at the corruption , inefficiency and political diversion of UNRRA . A member of his staff said that " to serve such an outfit is degradation beyond description . In fact , [ Morgan wrote ] , to have been rejected for such service I have always felt to have been a high honour . " 
 = = = Atomic Energy = = = 
 Morgan was appointed Colonel @-@ Commandant of the Royal Artillery in 1948 . In 1951 , he succeeded Lord Portal as Controller of Atomic Energy . The position had been created in January 1946 as " Controller of Production , Atomic Energy " when the Ministry of Supply had assumed responsibility for nuclear weapons . The job , the title of which was changed to " Controller Atomic Energy " in 1950 , had no written terms of reference , but carried broad responsibility for the coordination of all aspects of nuclear weapons production . Although located within the Ministry of Supply , the controller had direct access to the Prime Minister ; Portal rarely exercised this , however . It was widely believed that Morgan , who was , in the words of Margaret Gowing , " amiable but not adequate to the task " , had been appointed by mistake , having been confused with his namesake , General Sir William Duthie Morgan . The latter had greatly impressed Prime Minister Clement Attlee as Army member of the Joint Staff Mission to the United States from 1947 to 1950 . Morgan therefore relied heavily on his key subordinates , Sir John Cockcroft , William Penney , and Christopher Hinton . 
 In his role as Controller of Atomic Energy , Morgan was present for Operation Hurricane , the first British atomic weapons tests at the Montebello Islands in October 1952 . His position was gradually reduced to a figurehead , with his authority largely supplanted by the Atomic Energy Board , which was chaired by Lord Cherwell , and was abolished in 1954 with the creation of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority . Morgan then became Controller of Nuclear Weapons . Nonetheless , he was still an important figure in the push for higher @-@ yield weapons . He pressed for the testing of the Green Bamboo boosted fission weapon during Operation Mosaic . This resulted in Mosaic becoming a two @-@ test series , although Green Bamboo could not be made available in time . A Green Bamboo assembly was subsequently taken to Christmas Island for Operation Grapple , but was deleted from the test series to save money . Morgan was also instrumental in putting the case for the development of the H @-@ bomb on operational grounds . 
 Morgan retired in 1956 , although he remained Colonel Commandant of the Royal Artillery until 1958 . He published his memoirs , entitled Peace and War : A Soldier 's Life in 1961 . He died at Mount Vernon Hospital on 19 March 1967 . 
 = Phil Hughes = 
 Philip Joseph " Phil " Hughes ( born June 24 , 1986 ) is an American right @-@ handed professional baseball pitcher for the Minnesota Twins of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . He played in MLB for the New York Yankees from 2007 through 2013 . He stands 6 feet 5 inches ( 1 @.@ 96 m ) tall and weighs 240 pounds ( 110 kg ) . He was the Yankees ' first @-@ round pick in the 2004 MLB draft . 
 During his time in the Yankees ' minor @-@ league system , Hughes was one of the most highly anticipated prospects in baseball , but his major league career has thus far been marked by inconsistency . He debuted in the major leagues in 2007 as a starting pitcher and quickly demonstrated his potential with a bid for a no @-@ hitter in only his second MLB start . However , injury cut short his outing , as well as significant portions of his 2007 and 2008 seasons . Hughes began 2009 in the minors but later returned to the major leagues , eventually converting to a relief pitcher in June ; pitching as a setup man for Mariano Rivera , Hughes excelled in the new role during the regular season . Despite his struggles in the postseason , Hughes won a championship with the Yankees in the 2009 World Series . 
 Upon returning to the starting rotation in 2010 , he won 18 games and earned his first All @-@ Star selection . Arm fatigue cost Hughes nearly half of the season in 2011 , but the following year , he stayed healthy for the entire season , winning 16 games as the Yankees ' third starter . In 2013 , he had his worst season , posting a 4 – 14 win – loss record and 5 @.@ 19 earned run average , a performance that led to him being removed from the rotation . The following year , Hughes had a turnaround season with the Twins , where he went 16 @-@ 10 with an ERA of 3 @.@ 52 that resulted in him placing 7th in American League Cy Young Award voting .

 Hughes was born in Mission Viejo , California on June 24 , 1986 , and attended Foothill High School in Santa Ana , California , where he was a first @-@ team High School All @-@ American pitcher and had one perfect game . In his junior year ( 2003 ) , he had a 12 – 0 record and posted an 0 @.@ 78 earned run average ( ERA ) while striking out 85 batters in 72 innings . In his senior year ( 2004 ) , he had an 0 @.@ 69 ERA and a 9 – 1 record . In 61 innings , he gave up 41 hits and three walks while striking out 83 batters . 
 Hughes first committed to Santa Clara University , but he chose to sign with the New York Yankees when they selected him in the first round , with the 23rd overall selection , of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft . The Yankees were awarded this pick as compensation when free agent pitcher Andy Pettitte signed with the Houston Astros .

 In 2004 , Hughes pitched five scoreless innings for the rookie Gulf Coast League Yankees , striking out eight hitters . He spent 2005 , his first full professional year , between the Class A Charleston RiverDogs and the Advanced A Tampa Yankees . He had a 9 – 2 record and a 1 @.@ 24 ERA , and in 85 1 ⁄ 3 innings he gave up 54 hits while striking out 93 . 
 After attending spring training with the Yankees in 2006 , Hughes began the season with Tampa . He was promoted to the Double @-@ A Trenton Thunder of the Eastern League at the beginning of May after he had a 2 – 3 record and a 1 @.@ 80 ERA with Tampa while striking out 30 batters in 30 innings . 
 On June 13 , Hughes took a no @-@ hitter into the sixth inning and threw a one @-@ hitter through seven innings in a 3 – 0 victory over the New Hampshire Fisher Cats . Ten days later , he put forth another dominant start , taking a no @-@ hitter into the eighth inning and pitching eight shutout innings in a 4 – 0 win over the Connecticut Defenders . With Trenton , Hughes had a 10 – 3 record , a 2 @.@ 25 ERA , and 138 strikeouts in 116 innings . He made one appearance in the Eastern League playoffs , earning a no @-@ decision after pitching six innings of 1 @-@ run ball with 13 strikeouts . The game was the only postseason victory for the Thunder that year . After the season , he won the Kevin Lawn " Pitcher of the Year " Award as the top Yankees ' minor league pitcher . 
 Entering 2007 , Baseball America rated Hughes the Yankees ' # 1 prospect , said he had the best curveball and best control in the Yankee system , and called him " arguably the best pitching prospect in the minors . " Baseball America also named him the fourth @-@ best prospect in baseball . <unk> named Hughes the top right @-@ handed starting pitching prospect in the AL East farm systems . In January 2007 , the Yankees announced that Hughes was being invited to spring training . According to Bryan Hoch of MLB.com , scouts believed that Hughes was ready for the major leagues , but Yankees ' general manager Brian Cashman said it was " unlikely " that Hughes would play for the Yankees in April . Hughes began 2007 pitching for the Triple @-@ A Scranton / Wilkes @-@ Barre Yankees of the International League ( IL ) .

 Following injuries to several Yankees ' starters in 2007 , Hughes was called up in April . Hughes made his major league debut on April 26 against the Toronto Blue Jays . In 4 1 ⁄ 3 innings , he allowed four runs on seven hits , earning his first career loss . In his second major league start on May 1 against the Texas Rangers , he was maintaining a no @-@ hitter through 6 1 ⁄ 3 innings before pulling his left hamstring while facing his future teammate Mark Teixeira . Mike Myers later allowed a hit , but Hughes earned his first career win . After the game , he was placed on the disabled list ( DL ) . He returned on August 4 against the Kansas City Royals , allowing six runs in 4 2 ⁄ 3 innings and earning a no @-@ decision in a 16 – 8 victory . In his final start of the year , on September 27 against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays , he allowed one run in a season @-@ high seven innings and earned the win in a 3 – 1 victory . In 17 starts for the Yankees , Hughes had a 5 – 3 record , a 4 @.@ 46 ERA , and 58 strikeouts in 72 2 ⁄ 3 innings pitched . He was the second @-@ youngest American League ( AL ) player in 2007 . 
 Hughes was included on the Yankees ' postseason roster as a long reliever . He made his first postseason appearance in 2007 against the Cleveland Indians in the AL Division Series ( ALDS ) , giving up one run in two innings in Game 1 , a 12 – 3 loss . In Game 3 , Hughes ( the youngest player on the Yankees ' roster ) relieved an injured Roger Clemens ( the oldest player on the roster ) in the third inning and pitched 3 2 ⁄ 3 scoreless innings . He struck out four and earned his first playoff win . The Yankees were eliminated in four games in the series .

 Prior to the 2008 season , it was reported by numerous news sources that the Yankees were thinking of including Hughes in a trade to the Minnesota Twins for Johan Santana . The trade never happened ; Santana was traded to the New York Mets instead . 
 Hughes began the 2008 season as the third starter in the Yankees ' rotation . In his first six starts , he had an 0 – 4 record and a 9 @.@ 00 ERA . On April 30 , he was placed on the disabled list with a strained oblique and cracked rib . On a May 2 visit to an optometrist , Hughes was found to be slightly nearsighted ; as a result , he started wearing glasses on the mound . 
 After recovering from the rib injury , Hughes pitched for Scranton / Wilkes @-@ Barre ; he helped them win the 2008 International League title , earning the win after striking out 12 batters in the clinching game . On September 13 , a day after the IL playoffs , Hughes was recalled by the Yankees . On September 17 , Hughes made his first start since April 29 , giving up one earned run over four innings and earning a no @-@ decision in a 5 – 1 victory over the Chicago White Sox . In his final start of the season , on September 24 , he gave up two runs in eight innings and received a no @-@ decision in a ten @-@ inning , 6 – 2 victory over Toronto .

 Although he had a solid performance in spring training , Hughes began the 2009 season in Triple @-@ A. He was called up to the majors in April after Chien @-@ Ming Wang was placed on the disabled list . Hughes made his first start of the season on April 28 against the Detroit Tigers and pitched six scoreless innings , earning his first win since 2007 in an 11 – 0 victory . On May 25 , Hughes threw eight scoreless innings , earning the win in an 11 – 1 victory over the Rangers . 
 After he posted a 3 – 2 record and a 5 @.@ 45 ERA in seven starts , Hughes was moved to the bullpen when Wang returned to the rotation in early June . Hughes pitched well , becoming the primary setup man to Mariano Rivera in July due to injuries to Brian Bruney and Dámaso Marte . Despite his success as a reliever , Cashman maintained that Hughes would be a starter over the long @-@ term . 
 Hughes 's first regular season win in relief came on July 17 , when he threw two scoreless innings in a 5 – 3 victory over Detroit . On July 23 , he recorded his first career save after a 6 – 3 Yankees victory over the Oakland Athletics . He relieved CC Sabathia in the eighth inning and pitched two perfect innings . From June 10 through July 3 , he had a 25 1 ⁄ 3 inning scoreless streak , the longest by a Yankee reliever since Rivera had a 30 2 ⁄ 3 inning scoreless streak in 1999 . In 44 games as a relief pitcher in 2009 , Hughes posted a 1 @.@ 40 ERA ; he had 65 strikeouts in 51 1 ⁄ 3 innings . 
 Hughes pitched in all three games of the ALDS against the Minnesota Twins , posting a 9 @.@ 00 ERA . In Game 5 of the AL Championship Series ( ALCS ) against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim , he suffered a loss when he gave up a run and also allowed an inherited runner to score in the 7 – 6 defeat . He had scoreless outings in Games 2 and 3 as the Yankees won the series in six games . He had a 16 @.@ 20 ERA in the World Series , but he won his first World Series ring as the Yankees defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in six games . 
 = = = = 2010 = = = = 
 On March 25 , 2010 , Hughes was named the Yankees ' fifth starter . Throughout the season , the Yankees occasionally had Hughes skip starts to limit his innings , in hopes that this would help him stay healthy . On April 21 , Hughes carried a no @-@ hitter into the eighth inning against the Athletics before allowing a leadoff single to Eric Chavez ; he faced two more hitters prior to being relieved , having struck out 10 batters . 
 He won his first five decisions , a streak snapped May 22 by the New York Mets . He followed with another five @-@ game win streak , the last coming against the Mets on June 19 . After missing a start , he saw this win streak come to an end June 29 against the Seattle Mariners . 
 Hughes was named to the AL All @-@ Star Team , Sunday , July 4 . Five days after his first selection to the midsummer classic , Hughes threw seven innings and gave up one run to beat the Mariners 6 – 1 . His next outing , the All @-@ Star Game , did not go well . Hughes , after retiring the first batter he faced in the seventh inning , allowed a pair of singles to Scott Rolen and Matt Holliday before yielding to Matt Thornton ; Rolen and Holliday scored the tying and go @-@ ahead runs on Brian McCann 's three @-@ run double that proved decisive in the NL 's 3 – 1 victory . On August 14 , Hughes allowed three runs in six innings , earning the win in an 8 – 3 victory over the Kansas City Royals . It was the 50th start of Hughes 's career , making him at 24 years and 51 days old the youngest Yankee to make his 50th start since Al Downing made his 50th start at 23 years and 61 days old in 1964 . Hughes had 18 wins ( tied for fourth in the AL with Trevor Cahill and Justin Verlander behind Sabathia , who had 21 , and Jon Lester and David Price , who both had 19 ) , only 8 losses , and a 4 @.@ 19 ERA while striking out 146 batters in 176 1 ⁄ 3 innings of work . His run support of 6 @.@ 48 runs per game was the highest in the major leagues . 
 Hughes made his first postseason start in Game 3 of the ALDS against the Twins . He threw seven shutout innings to earn the win in the clinching game of the series as the Yankees beat the Twins 6 – 1 . Game 2 of the ALCS against the Rangers did not go as well for Hughes , who allowed seven runs in four innings and earned the loss as the Yankees were defeated 7 – 2 . He allowed four runs in 4 2 ⁄ 3 innings in Game 6 and earned another loss as the Yankees lost 6 – 1 and were eliminated from the postseason .

 Hughes , who began as the third starter in the 2011 season , suffered from a dip in velocity . His four @-@ seam fastball averaged only 89 mph and peaked at 92 mph after three starts , compared to his usual 92 – 95 mph . After opening the season 0 – 1 with a 13 @.@ 94 ERA in three starts , Hughes was placed on the DL due to a dead arm syndrome . It was later revealed that Hughes had been suffering from shoulder inflammation . He underwent an arm strength rehabilitation program for several weeks . On July 6 , he made his first start in nearly 3 months , pitching five innings , allowing two earned runs , striking out and walking two batters , in a 5 – 3 loss to the Cleveland Indians . On August 2 , in a rain @-@ shortened game , Hughes threw his first career shutout as the Yankees defeated the White Sox 6 – 0 in six innings . Late in September , Hughes was moved to the bullpen after back stiffness caused him to miss a start . In 17 games ( 14 starts ) , Hughes had a 5 – 5 record , a 5 @.@ 79 ERA , and 47 strikeouts in 74 2 ⁄ 3 innings pitched . 
 Hughes was included on the Yankees ' postseason roster as a relief pitcher . He had scoreless outings in Games 4 and 5 of the ALDS as the Yankees were defeated by the Detroit Tigers in five games .

 On January 16 , 2012 , Hughes signed a one @-@ year deal worth $ 3 @.@ 25 million that included incentives , effectively avoiding arbitration . His deal was a $ 500 @,@ 000 raise from his disappointing 2011 season . 
 Hughes was the Yankees ' third starter in 2012 . He started the season averaging only four innings in his first four starts while posting a 1 – 3 record and a 7 @.@ 88 ERA . From May to the end of the season , however , Hughes had a 15 – 10 record and a 3 @.@ 90 ERA . He had a season @-@ high four @-@ game winning streak from May 22 through June 15 . Hughes threw a complete game on June 3 , allowing one run in a 5 – 1 win against the Tigers . On June 26 , he threw eight shutout innings and earned the win in a 6 – 4 victory over Cleveland .

On May 15 against the Seattle Mariners , Hughes only lasted 2 ⁄ 3 of an inning after giving up 7 runs , 6 hits , 2 walks , including a grand slam to former Yankee Raúl Ibañez in a 12 – 2 Yankee loss . It was the shortest start of his career and at the time the shortest non @-@ injury start by a Yankee at the new Yankee Stadium . 
 After pitching to a 4 @-@ 13 record and a 4 @.@ 86 ERA , with a 5 @.@ 71 ERA in the second half , the Yankees removed Hughes from the rotation on September 4 , replacing him with David Huff . Hughes went 1 – 10 in home starts in 2013 , making him just the second MLB pitcher to win fewer than two games when making at least 15 home starts in a season ; the other being Phil Huffman of the Toronto Blue Jays in 1979 .

 Looking to build on the success of his 2014 season , Hughes went into the 2015 season as the Twins ace . Hughes had lost velocity in his fastball , dropping from <unk> to <unk> . His 2015 season was marred with inconsistency and injury as he only started 25 times while appearing 2 times out of the bullpen . Despite going 11 @-@ 9 , his ERA was 4 @.@ 40 and he served up 29 home runs in only 155 @.@ 1 innings .

 On June 9 , 2016 , Hughes was struck in the left knee off a line drive from J.T. <unk> and left the game . The next day , he was placed on the 15 @-@ day disabled list due to left knee contusion . He was ruled out for 6 @-@ 8 weeks . On June 11 , it was revealed that there was a non @-@ displaced fracture of the femur in the left knee . On June 12 , he was transferred to the 60 @-@ day disabled list . On June 28th , Hughes ' season was declared over as he was set to undergo season ending surgery .

 As a child , Hughes was a Boston Red Sox fan . He had a poster of Nomar Garciaparra with the slogan " Reverse the Curse " on his bedroom wall . Hughes is a Christian . His baseball glove has the reference for the Bible verse Philippians 4 : 13 on it , and Hughes has the entire verse ( " I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me . " ) tattooed on his left arm . He enjoys watching the Food Network and is a fan of Alton Brown . 
 = = Scouting report = = 
 Hughes 's pitch repertoire has varied over the years , although his main pitch has consistently been a four @-@ seam fastball at 92 – 95 mph , and he has also relied on a spike curveball in the range of 73 – 77 mph . He has also developed a mid @-@ 80s Vulcan changeup against left @-@ handed hitters , and in mid @-@ 2012 he developed a low @-@ 80s slider to right @-@ handers . 
 Hughes added a cut fastball in the high 80s as a weapon against right @-@ handers in the 2008 season , and he used the pitch 16 % of the time in the 2009 and 2010 seasons : 
 By early 2011 , Hughes 's velocity on his fastball was down several mph ; John Harper of the New York Daily News speculated that Hughes 's overuse of the cutter was to blame , not a dead arm . Hughes continued to use the cutter into the start of the 2012 season ; he posted a 7 @.@ 88 ERA in April , throwing the cutter about 12 % of the time in this span . In early May , Hughes dropped the cutter from his repertoire , using it only 1 @.@ 2 % of the time for the rest of the year . 
 Hughes throws a disproportionate number of his pitches high in the strike zone and above the zone . 
 Hughes asserts that the hamstring injury he suffered in his rookie year has permanently altered his pitching mechanics : " My stride , and things like that , have never quite been the same . "

 = Mummy Cave = 
 Mummy Cave is a rock shelter and archeological site in Park County , Wyoming , United States , near the eastern entrance to Yellowstone National Park . The site is adjacent to the concurrent U.S. Routes 14 / 16 / 20 , on the left bank of the North Fork of the Shoshone River at an altitude of 6 @,@ 310 feet ( 1 @,@ 920 m ) in Shoshone National Forest . 
 At its mouth , the cave is approximately 150 feet ( 46 m ) wide , and it extends approximately 40 feet ( 12 m ) into a volcanic cliff above the North Fork . It lies along the left bank of the river , next to the mouth of a small stream and opposite from the mouth of Blackwater Creek . The largest known cave along the North Fork , it is believed to have been carved by the river 's flow ; the reason for its diversion away from the alcove is unknown . 
 Mummy Cave was occupied between 7280 BC and AD 1580 . Discovered by Cody resident Gene Smith in 1957 , it was first studied in 1962 and excavated by the Buffalo Bill Historical Center . The site includes unusual amounts of perishable materials such as hide , feathers and wood , as well as the buried and mummified remains of an inhabitant , named by researchers " Mummy Joe , " and dated to about AD 800 . The cave is notable for the depth of its cultural deposits , extending over 28 feet ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) in depth , and in particular for the continuity of those deposits . The deposits have been classified into 38 occupation levels that represent at least seasonal use of the site on an annual basis , extending from the Paleoindian period to the late Prehistoric period . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Although it is referred to as a " cave " , Mummy Cave is actually a broad , shallow alcove in a vertical cliff . It owes its depth to its overall size and the stability of the parent rock . The alcove 's roof is about 50 feet ( 15 m ) above the river , with the rock floor of the alcove at about 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) above the river . By the time it was discovered , the alcove had been almost entirely filled with alluvium . The cliff is composed of Tertiary period volcanic ash mixed with larger rock fragments of volcanic origin . A similar alcove is being cut by the Shoshone at the mouth of Clocktower Creek . The cave fill has accumulated for at least 10 @,@ 000 years and appears to have originated from nearby debris fans formed where weathered material has flowed down channels in neighboring cliffs . 
 Apart from the depth and consistent nature of the alluvium , Mummy Cave is also characterized by extreme dryness . The pointed shape of the cliff above prevents rain and meltwater from percolating through the rock to the cave , and there are no vertical joints in the rock above . 
 = = Archeological investigation = = 
 The investigation of Mummy Cave was led by Robert Edgar from 1963 to 1965 . The alcove was marked out into a 5 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) grid , with a permanent reference mark for elevation marked on the wall . Initial investigation focused on establishing stratigraphy . Once the layers of alluvium in the cave floor were established , the excavation proceeded layer by layer . The excavations terraced the cave floor into 4 @-@ to @-@ 6 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 8 m ) levels , following the established reference grid . Digging was done with hand <unk> in the artifact @-@ bearing layers while layers devoid of artifacts were excavated with shovels . Spoils were disposed of down the embankment . 
 The site had previously been disturbed by relic hunters , who had dug a 2 @.@ 5 feet ( 0 @.@ 76 m ) deep pit in what turned out to be the most productive zone of the excavation . The relic hunters appear to have stopped when they encountered a rock cairn that covered what proved to be a human burial site . 
 By the end of 1963 a portion of the site had been excavated to a depth of 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) and shored with timbers , while the upper three cultural zones ( layers 36 – 38 ) were removed across the site . During the 1964 season layers 29 – 35 were removed and some zones were excavated much more deeply . In 1965 layers 24 – 28 were removed from the central area of the alcove . By this time it was clear that excavation would proceed for the full depth of the site , and that the disposal of a considerable quantity of excavated debris would need to be addressed . A bulldozer was brought in to remove sections of fill beyond the drip line of the shelter . The 1966 season was directed by Wilfred M. Husted . Results of the Mummy Cave investigations were published in Science in 1968 . 
 = = Results = = 
 The excavation of Mummy Cave yielded a nearly continuous succession of artifacts , which span a period of over 9000 years . The artifacts were disposed in a manner that permitted dating in both relative terms through stratigraphy , as well as through radiocarbon dating to establish an absolute scale . This continuum has proved to be invaluable in relating and dating other excavations in the Rocky Mountain region . In particular , the stone projectile points found at Mummy Cave have been used to set the standard for classifying stone arrowheads and spear heads in the region . The point typology has been extrapolated to define cultural and commercial relationships between peoples throughout the American West . Stratigraphy and carbon dating indicate that Mummy Cave was first occupied near the end of the Pinedale glaciation . Later occupancy spanned the <unk> , followed by a cooler climate from about 1000 BC . 
 The earliest layers at Mummy Cave yielded a few prismatic stone blades dating to about <unk> BC . Several layers contained no artifacts and were defined by soot layers . By layer 6 the first parallel @-@ oblique points appeared . By Layer 8 , roughly corresponding to 6500 BC , the cultural evidence became continuous . Layers 8 , 9 , 10 and 12 produced lanceolate or leaf @-@ shaped projectile points which have been interpreted as corresponding to Angostura @-@ style points . This implies that the inhabitants of Mummy Cave during this era were big @-@ game hunters from the Great Plains who adapted to the mountain environment . In layer 16 , radiocarbon dated to <unk> BC , a new type of point appeared . These Blackwater side @-@ notched points implied the arrival of a group from eastern Nebraska or western Iowa , replacing the previous group which may have moved to the north . The presence of such points suggests a connection with the Simonsen Site in northeastern Iowa , which has been dated to the Early Archaic period . This transition coincided with the climatic shift to the <unk> . Side @-@ notched points recovered from layers 21 , 24 and 28 imply a return of the previous inhabitants ; the easterners had moved on to the central Columbian Plateau . 
 Layer 30 was dated to 2470 ± 150 BC . Layer 32 was dated to 870 ± 135 BC . It is hypothesized that layers 32 – 38 represent the presence of people of the Shoshonean culture , with increasingly definitive Shoshonean artifacts present from layer 36 onward , including cordage and <unk> . Layer 38 yielded gray flat @-@ bottomed pottery of Shoshonean manufacture . Layer 36 is notable as the source of the " mummy . " The desiccated body of an adult male covered by a sheepskin garment with fur and feather ornament was recovered from this layer and dated to about AD 770 by radiocarbon dating . 
 Several thousand animal bones were discovered in Mummy Cave . While the large majority of the bones could not be identified , researchers at the University of Texas at El Paso ( UTEP ) were able to determine the biological origins of over two thousand bones . As at many other archeological sites in the region , significant numbers of Bighorn Sheep ( Ovis canadensis ) and deer from the genus Odocoileus were identified . Of particular interest to biologists was the much larger number of sheep than deer : eighty @-@ eight sheep and fifteen deer were identified . Such a prevalence of sheep over deer is highly unusual for archeological sites in the region , because deer are equally or more plentiful in areas such as the one in which Mummy Cave is located . This anomaly has led researchers at UTEP to propose that the site was used as a home base for hunters to operate at higher altitudes . 
 The wide range of artifacts discovered at the site has caused Mummy Cave to be seen as a highly significant site for the study of Rocky Mountain archeology . The cave 's significance was recognized by the National Park Service with its placement on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 .

 The accompanying music video was directed by <unk> Ishii . It opens with a couple arguing in a taxi , which later has them leaving the car and walk down the street . Behind them has Hamasaki sitting on a bench observing a puppet show , smiling in the distance . The taxi driver questions her smiling , and looks at the show . It then shows several camera angles with Hamasaki singing the song , and then has the second verse with Hamasaki and a male companion as the marionette dolls . As marionette dolls , they both walk past each other in a dark atmosphere , whilst the chorus has Hamasaki singing the song again at the bench . As the second chorus is about to begin , several children start to play with the dolls , to Hamasaki 's delight . However , the children decide to purchase the male doll , and leaves the female doll ( portrayed by Hamasaki ) on the small puppet show 's stage . 
 As the town , where Hamasaki is sitting on the bench , starts to rain , the atmosphere where Hamasaki is the doll starts to rain as well . Just after Hamasaki finishes singing the second chorus , an instrumental break happens and has Hamasaki looking at the now abandoned puppet show . A truck then drives past , which vibrates the puppet show 's stage , causing the doll to fall on the ground and its strings become tangled . This happens to Hamasaki as the doll ; she faints in the dark atmosphere land , with strings attached to her . Hamasaki , sitting on the bench , starts to cry and sings the remaining of the song . It ends with the taxi driver , who finishes day dreaming about the marionettes dolls , opening the door for Hamasaki to enter .

 = New York State Route 15A = 
 New York State Route 15A ( NY 15A ) is a north – south state highway located in the western portion of New York in the United States . It serves as an easterly alternate route of NY 15 , beginning in the Livingston County town of Springwater and ending 35 @.@ 19 miles ( 56 @.@ 63 km ) to the north in the Monroe County city of Rochester . NY 15A meets U.S. Route 20A ( US 20A ) in the hamlet of Hemlock , US 20 and NY 5 in the village of Lima , and Interstate 390 ( I @-@ 390 ) twice in Henrietta and Brighton . Its southern and middle sections traverse mostly rural areas , while the northernmost piece in Henrietta , Brighton , and Rochester passes through significantly more developed areas . 
 From 1927 to the late 1930s , modern NY 15 was part of NY 2 . As a result , all of what is now NY 15A was originally designated as New York State Route 2A as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . Two parts of the route were sub @-@ standard at the time ; however , those sections were rebuilt in the early and mid @-@ 1930s . NY 2 was supplanted by an extended US 15 c . 1939 , at which time NY 2A was renumbered to NY 15A to match its parent 's new designation . 
 = = Route description = = 
 = = = Livingston and Ontario Counties = = = 
 NY 15A begins at an intersection with NY 15 in the town of Springwater hamlet of the same name , also officially known as Springwater Hamlet , located on the east side of a large valley in southeastern Livingston County . The route heads northward as North Main Street , proceeding along the eastern base of the valley as it passes through the northern half of the community . Outside of the hamlet , NY 15A enters a rural , undeveloped area dominated by dense forests to the east and a low @-@ lying , slightly more open area to the west . As the route approaches the Livingston – Ontario county line , the lowlands give way to marshes , which in turn lead to Hemlock Lake at the county line . While in Ontario County in the town of <unk> , NY 15A follows a more inland route to the east , passing through an isolated forest situated between Hemlock and <unk> Lakes . After 6 miles ( 10 km ) , the highway reenters Livingston County near the northern end of Hemlock Lake . 
 Now in the town of Livonia , NY 15A becomes Bald Hill Road as it passes by Hemlock Lake Park , a local park situated at the northeastern tip of the lake . It changes names again just 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) later upon entering the hamlet of Hemlock . Here , it becomes Main Street and intersects US 20A , which forms a concurrency with NY 15A along the length of Main Street . The concurrency continues through Hemlock and into rural Livonia , where the 2 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) overlap ends as US 20A turns west towards Buffalo . NY 15A , meanwhile , heads northward into the town of Lima as Plank Road . It continues across rural terrain for another 3 miles ( 5 km ) to the village of Lima , where it becomes Lake Avenue . At the village center , NY 15A crosses over US 20 and NY 5 and changes names to Rochester Street . The route leaves the community and its residential surroundings after 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 21 km ) , but retains the Rochester Street name until it reaches the Livingston – Monroe county line west of Honeoye Falls . 
 = = = Monroe County = = = 
 Across the county line in the town of Mendon , NY 15A takes on the name Rush – Lima Road and begins curving to the northwest . It connects to Honeoye Falls twice : first via Main Street at a junction just north of the county line , and later by way of Monroe Street ( formerly NY 363 ) at an intersection 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the northwest . Past Monroe Street , the route makes a long , significant turn to the west , following Honeoye Creek into the town of Rush and the hamlet of the same name . The highway meets Rush – West Rush Road at an intersection south of the community , at which point NY 15A turns back to the north and crosses over Honeoye Creek . In the process , NY 15A becomes East Henrietta Road , a name the highway retains until its northern end in Rochester . On the opposite side of the creek , NY 15A intersects NY 251 in the center of Rush . 
 Outside of Rush , NY 15A takes on a more northeasterly alignment as it passes Rush 's town reservoir and enters the town of Henrietta . The surroundings initially remain as rural as they were in Rush ; however , the amount of development along the highway gradually increases as the route approaches and passes over the New York State Thruway ( I @-@ 90 ) . One mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) later , NY 15A intersects NY 253 in a densely populated area west of Rush – Henrietta Senior High School . The homes continue for another 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) to the Monroe County Fairgrounds ( home to The Dome Center ) , at which point NY 15A begins to become lined with commercial establishments . The trend temporarily ceases around an interchange with I @-@ 390 — where NY 15A curves northwestward — but resumes ahead of a junction with NY 252 , itself a major commercial strip . 
 North of NY 252 , NY 15A passes under the CSX Transportation @-@ owned West Shore Subdivision and crosses into Brighton . Just past the town line , the route connects to Clay and Brighton – Henrietta Town Line Roads by way of a grade @-@ separated intersection 0 @.@ 25 miles ( 0 km ) north of the railroad overpass . It continues onward , passing along the west side of the sprawling Monroe Community College campus to another interchange with I @-@ 390 . NY 15A passes over the Erie Canal and enters the city of Rochester shortly afterward . Once in the city , the route passes by two large office campuses south of Westfall Road and several blocks of homes north of the street before merging back into NY 15 ( Mount Hope Avenue ) at a junction east of Strong Memorial Hospital . 
 = = History = = 
 What is now NY 15 was originally designated as part of NY 4 when the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 . The route was renumbered to NY 2 in 1927 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new US 4 in eastern New York . Modern NY 15A , meanwhile , was only partially state @-@ maintained by the mid @-@ 1920s . In 1926 , only two sections of the route were state @-@ owned : from Monroe Street west of Honeoye Falls north to Rochester , and the segment of highway in Livonia that modern NY 15A shares with US 20A . In spite of this fact , all of what is now NY 15A was designated as NY 2A , an alternate route of NY 2 between Springwater and Rochester , in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . 
 The sub @-@ standard sections of the route between Springwater and Hemlock and from north of Hemlock to Honeoye Falls were improved in stages over the next half @-@ decade , beginning with the piece between the villages of Lima and Honeoye Falls c . 1931 . The remainder of the Hemlock – Honeoye Falls segment and the entirety of the route south of Hemlock was rebuilt c . 1934 . NY 2 was replaced c . 1939 by US 15 , which was extended northward from its previous terminus at the Pennsylvania state line to Rochester . NY 2A was renumbered to NY 15A as a result . NY 15A has not been substantially altered since that time .

 = Battle of Vukovar = 
 The Battle of Vukovar ( Croatian : Bitka za Vukovar , Serbian : <unk> за <unk> , Bitka za Vukovar ) was an 87 @-@ day siege of Vukovar in eastern Croatia by the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) , supported by various paramilitary forces from Serbia , between August and November 1991 . Before the Croatian War of Independence the Baroque town was a prosperous , mixed community of Croats , Serbs and other ethnic groups . As Yugoslavia began to break up , Serbia 's President Slobodan Milošević and Croatia 's President Franjo Tuđman started to pursue nationalist politics . In 1990 , an armed insurrection was started by Croatian Serb militias , supported by the Serbian government and paramilitary groups , who seized control of Serb @-@ populated areas of Croatia . The JNA began to intervene in favour of the rebellion , and conflict broke out in the eastern Croatian region of Slavonia in May 1991 . In August , the JNA launched a full @-@ scale attack against Croatian @-@ held territory in eastern Slavonia , including Vukovar . 
 Vukovar was defended by around 1 @,@ 800 lightly armed soldiers of the Croatian National Guard ( ZNG ) and civilian volunteers , against 36 @,@ 000 JNA soldiers and Serb paramilitaries equipped with heavy armour and artillery . During the battle , shells and rockets were fired into the town at a rate of up to 12 @,@ 000 a day . At the time , it was the fiercest and most protracted battle seen in Europe since 1945 , and Vukovar was the first major European town to be entirely destroyed since the Second World War . When Vukovar fell on 18 November 1991 , several hundred soldiers and civilians were massacred by Serb forces and at least 31 @,@ 000 civilians were expelled from the town and its surroundings . Most of Vukovar was ethnically cleansed of its non @-@ Serb population and became part of the self @-@ declared Republic of Serbian Krajina . Several Serb military and political officials , including Milošević , were later indicted and in some cases jailed for war crimes committed during and after the battle . 
 The battle exhausted the JNA and proved a turning point in the Croatian war . A ceasefire was declared a few weeks later . Vukovar remained in Serb hands until 1998 , when it was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia . It has since been rebuilt but has less than half of its pre @-@ war population and many buildings are still scarred by the battle . Its two principal ethnic communities remain deeply divided and it has not regained its former prosperity . 
 = = Background = = 
 Vukovar is an important regional centre on Croatia 's eastern border , situated in eastern Slavonia on the west bank of the Danube river . The area has a diverse population of Croats , Serbs , Hungarians , Slovaks , Ruthenians and many other nationalities , who had lived together for centuries in relative harmony before the Croatian war . It was one of the wealthiest areas of Yugoslavia before the war . Vukovar 's long @-@ standing prosperity was reflected in one of Croatia 's finest ensembles of Baroque architecture . 
 The region underwent major demographic changes following the Second World War , when its ethnic German inhabitants were expelled and replaced with settlers from elsewhere in Yugoslavia . In the last Yugoslav census in 1991 , the Vukovar municipality , which included the town and surrounding villages , was recorded as having 84 @,@ 189 inhabitants , of whom 43 @.@ 8 percent were Croats , 37 @.@ 5 percent were Serbs and the remainder were members of other ethnic groups . The town 's population was 47 percent Croat and 32 @.@ 3 percent Serb . 
 From 1945 , the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was governed as a federal socialist state comprising six newly created republics – Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Serbia , Montenegro and Macedonia . The current border between Serbia and Croatia was defined in 1945 by a Yugoslav federal government commission which assigned areas with a majority Serb population to the Socialist Republic of Serbia and those with a Croatian majority to the Socialist Republic of Croatia . This left a large Serb minority in Croatian territory . 
 After Yugoslavia 's leader Josip Broz Tito died in 1980 , long @-@ suppressed ethnic nationalism revived and the individual republics began to assert their authority more strongly as the federal government weakened . Slovenia and Croatia moved towards multi @-@ party democracy and economic reform , but Serbia 's authoritarian communist President Slobodan Milošević opposed reform and sought to increase the power of the communist Yugoslav government . In 1990 , Slovenia and Croatia held elections that ended communist rule and brought pro @-@ independence nationalist parties to power in both republics . In Croatia , the Croatian Democratic Union ( HDZ ) party of Franjo Tuđman took office , with Tuđman as President . 
 Tuđman 's programme was opposed by many members of Croatia 's Serbian minority , towards whom he was overtly antagonistic . The Serb Democratic Party ( SDS ) of Croatia , supported by Milošević , denounced the HDZ as a reincarnation of the nationalist @-@ fascist Ustaše movement , which had massacred hundreds of thousands of Serbs during the Second World War . From mid @-@ 1990 , the SDS mounted an armed rebellion in Serb @-@ inhabited areas of Croatia and set up the self @-@ declared Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina with covert support from the Serbian government and Serbian paramilitary groups . The Croatian government rapidly lost control of large areas of the republic . In February 1991 , the Krajina Serbs declared independence from Croatia and announced that they would unite with Serbia . Other Serb communities around Croatia also announced that they would secede and established their own militias . 
 = = Prelude to the battle = = 
 The conflict between Serbs and Croats spread to eastern Slavonia in early 1991 . On 1 April , Serb villagers around Vukovar and other towns in eastern Slavonia began to erect barricades across main roads . The White Eagles , a Serbian paramilitary group led by Vojislav Šešelj , moved into the Serb @-@ populated village of Borovo Selo just north of Vukovar . In mid @-@ April 1991 , Gojko Šušak , a Croatian government minister and hardline nationalist , personally fired three Armbrust shoulder @-@ launched anti @-@ tank missiles at houses inhabited by Serbs in Borovo Selo . There were no casualties , but the attack aggravated and deepened ethnic tensions . On 2 May , Serb paramilitaries ambushed two Croatian police buses in the centre of Borovo Selo , killing 12 policemen and injuring 22 more . Three Serbs were also killed . The Battle of Borovo Selo represented the worst act of violence between the country 's Serbs and Croats since the Second World War . It enraged many Croatians and led to a surge of ethnic violence across Slavonia . 
 Shortly after , Yugoslav People 's Army units moved into Borovo Selo . The army 's intervention was welcomed by local Croatian leaders , but Croatian deputy interior minister Milan <unk> accused the JNA of preventing the Croatian police from dealing with the paramilitaries . Gun battles broke out across the region between rival militias . In Vukovar , Croatians harassed Serb residents , sometimes violently . Croatian police forcibly took over the local radio station , Radio Vukovar , and Serb members of the station 's ethnically mixed staff were fired and replaced with Croats . Serb militias systematically blocked transport routes in the predominantly Serb @-@ inhabited countryside around Vukovar , and within days the town could only be reached by an unpaved track running through Croat @-@ inhabited villages . The atmosphere in Vukovar was said to be " murderous " . 
 On 19 May 1991 , the Croatian government held a nationwide referendum on a declaration of sovereignty . In Vukovar , as elsewhere in Croatia , hardline Serb nationalists urged Serbs to boycott the referendum , while moderates advocated using the poll to register opposition to independence . Many local Serbs did vote , but the referendum passed with 94 percent nationally voting in favour . 
 Violence in and around Vukovar worsened after the independence referendum . Repeated gun and bomb attacks were reported in the town and surrounding villages . Sporadic shelling of the city started in June , and increased in intensity throughout the summer . Borovo Naselje , the Croatian @-@ held northern suburb of Vukovar , sustained a significant shelling on 4 July . Serb paramilitaries expelled thousands of non @-@ Serbs from their homes in the municipality . Croatian paramilitaries , led by Tomislav Merčep , attacked Serbs in and around Vukovar ; between thirty and eighty @-@ six Serbs were alleged to have disappeared or been killed , and thousands of others fled their homes . A Croatian government representative in Vukovar told the Zagreb authorities that " the city is again [ the ] victim of terror , armed strife and provocative shoot @-@ outs with potentially unfathomable consequences . The policy pursued so far has created an atmosphere of terror among the Croatian and Serbian population . " Gunmen from both sides burned and looted hundreds of houses and farms in the area . 
 The conflict blurred ethnic lines . Many Serbs who had lived in Vukovar for generations – known as the <unk> or " old settlers " – resisted the propaganda coming from Belgrade and Knin and continued to live peacefully with their Croatian neighbours . The <unk> , or " newcomers " , whose families had relocated from southern Serbia and Montenegro to replace the deported Germans after 1945 , were the most responsive to nationalist appeals . Paolo <unk> describes how they " tried to win their <unk> over to the patriotic mobilization , and when they had no success with that , they killed them , plundered their property and goods , or drove them away . The old settlers would not let themselves be stirred up against other nationalities . " When Croats fled the fighting they often gave their house keys for safekeeping to their Serb neighbours , whom they trusted , rather than to the Croatian police . Sabrina P. Ramet comments that the distinctive feature of the war in eastern Slavonia was " the mobilization of those who were not integrated into the multi @-@ cultural life of the cities against urban multi @-@ culturalism . " The former mayor of Belgrade , Bogdan Bogdanović , characterises the attack on Vukovar as an act of " <unk> " , a deliberate assault on urbanism . 
 = = Opposing forces = = 
 By the end of July 1991 , an improvised Croatian defence force in Vukovar was almost surrounded by Serbian militias in the neighbouring villages . <unk> , Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) soldiers and Serbian conscripts of the Territorial Defence forces ( Croatian : Teritorijalna obrana , Serbian : <unk> <unk> or TO ) were present in Serb @-@ inhabited areas . There was a small JNA force in the town barracks in the Sajmište district of Vukovar , surrounded by territory controlled by Croatian forces . Although the two sides were commonly referred to as " Croatian " and " Serbian " or " Yugoslav " , Serbs and Croats as well as many other of Yugoslavia 's national groups fought on both sides . The first commander of the attacking force was a Macedonian , and a substantial portion of the Croatian defenders were Serbs and members of other ethnicities . 
 = = = Croatian forces = = = 
 The Croatian force in Vukovar comprised 1 @,@ 800 men assembled from units of the newly created Croatian National Guard , including 400 members of the 3rd Guards Brigade and the 1st Guards Brigade . The 4th Battalion of the 3rd Guards Brigade was stationed in the city from the beginning , while elements of the 1st Guards Brigade arrived retreating from elsewhere in western Syrmia . In addition to the guardsmen there were 300 police officers and 1 @,@ 100 civilian volunteers from Vukovar and nearby communities . The bulk of the force had initially been organised in an improvised manner , but was formally reorganised in late September 1991 as the 204th Vukovar Brigade , also known as the 124th Brigade . 
 Volunteers arrived from other parts of Croatia , including from the far @-@ right paramilitary Croatian Defence Forces ( HOS ) backed by Dobroslav <unk> 's extreme nationalist Croatian Party of Rights ( HSP ) . The defenders were a cross @-@ section of Vukovar society ; as many as a third were non @-@ Croats , including Serbs , Ruthenians , Hungarians and other ethnicities . About a hundred of the defenders were Serbs . According to Zoran <unk> , one of the Croat defenders , " We had complete confidence in them . They defended Vukovar alongside us . " A 300 @-@ strong HOS battalion named the Black Legion led by Alija <unk> operated in Vukovar under the Croatian Ministry of the Interior as a " anti @-@ terrorist brigade " . 
 The Croatian force in Vukovar was commanded by Mile Dedaković , a former JNA officer who had joined the ZNG . Dedaković volunteered for a post in Vukovar and took charge of the town 's defences . During the siege of Vukovar he was referred to as Jastreb ( " Hawk " ) . At the time , the Croatian Minister of Defence Šušak publicly claimed that Dedaković was a Serb , a claim that was later reprinted by independent sources , but was false . Dedaković 's second @-@ in @-@ command , Branko Borković , was another former JNA officer who had volunteered for service in Vukovar . The two men established a unified command structure , organised the defenders into a single brigade and implemented an integrated defence system . A defensive ring of six sectors was established , each assigned to one unit within the 204th Brigade . The defenders used a network of cellars , canals , ditches and trenches to redeploy around the sectors as needed . 
 At the start of the battle , they were poorly armed and many were equipped only with hunting rifles . They relied mostly on light infantry weapons , but obtained a few artillery pieces and anti @-@ aircraft guns and improvised their own land mines . They also obtained several hundred anti @-@ tank weapons such as M79 and <unk> rocket launchers , but were critically short of ammunition throughout the battle . Although the Croatian government sent some supplies and reinforcements in the early stages , the defenders received little of significance . This was partly because of the difficulty of reaching the town , but may also have been a result of the Croatian government 's decision to supply large quantities of arms to the Bosnian Croats in advance of the Bosnian War . In doing so , it starved its own forces of weapons and ammunition . 
 = = = Yugoslav and Serb forces = = = 
 The attacking force included JNA soldiers conscripted from across Yugoslavia , members of the TO , Chetniks ( Serbian nationalist paramilitaries ) , local Serb militiamen and units of the Yugoslav Navy and the Yugoslav Air Force . At their peak , the Yugoslav and Serb forces in the vicinity of Vukovar numbered about 36 @,@ 000 troops . They were equipped with heavy artillery , rockets and tanks and supported by aircraft and naval vessels on the Danube . 
 Although the battle was fought primarily by the federal Yugoslav military , the government of Serbia was directly involved . The Serbian secret police agency , the SDB , took part in military operations , and some of its officers commanded Serbian TO units fighting in Vukovar . The Serbian interior ministry directed the activities of the paramilitaries as well as arming and equipping them . Slobodan Milošević was later accused of direct involvement . According to Veselin Šljivančanin , who was later convicted of war crimes committed at Vukovar , the order to shell Vukovar came " from <unk> " – the elite Belgrade quarter where Milošević lived . 
 At the start of the war in Slovenia , the army still saw itself as the defender of a federal , communist Yugoslavia , rather than an instrument of Serbian nationalism . Its head , General Veljko Kadijević , the Yugoslav Minister of Defence and a committed communist , initially sought to forcibly keep Yugoslavia together and proclaimed the army 's neutrality in the Serb @-@ Croat conflict . The JNA leadership aimed to cut Croatia in two by seizing the Serb @-@ inhabited inland regions , almost all of the Dalmatian coast and much of central and eastern Croatia . It aimed to force Croatia 's political leadership to capitulate and renegotiate its membership of Yugoslavia . The JNA 's leadership was not yet dominated by ethnic Serbs , and these early goals reflected the " Yugoslav " outlook of its multiethnic leadership . Kadijević was half @-@ Croat and half @-@ Serb , his deputy was a Slovene , the commander of JNA forces in the first phase of the battle was a Macedonian , and the head of the Yugoslav Air Force , which repeatedly bombed Vukovar during the battle , was a Croat . 
 The loss of Slovenia in the Ten @-@ Day War made it impossible to fulfil the original objective of keeping Yugoslavia intact . Many of the Serb members of the army no longer wanted to fight for a multiethnic Yugoslavia . The army developed an increasingly Serbian character as non @-@ Serbs deserted or refused to be drafted . Some JNA commanders overtly supported the Serb rebels in Croatia and provided them with weapons . Although Kadijević and other senior JNA commanders initially argued that " the JNA must defend all the nations of Yugoslavia " , they eventually recognised that they had no chance of achieving their original goals , and threw their support behind the rebel Serbs of Croatia . 
 Yugoslav and Serb propaganda portrayed the Croatians as genocidal Ustaše , who had illegally taken over Yugoslav territory and were threatening Serb civilians in a reprise of the anti @-@ Serb pogroms of the Second World War . Kadijević later justified the JNA 's offensive against Vukovar on the grounds that it was part of the " backbone of the Croatian army " and had to be " liberated " . The JNA 's periodical Narodna Armija claimed after the battle that Vukovar " had for decades been prepared to support German military penetration down the Danube . " The paramilitary leader Vojislav Šešelj declared : " We 're all one army . This war is a great test for Serbs . Those who pass the test will become winners . Deserters cannot go unpunished . Not a single Ustaša must leave Vukovar alive . " 
 = = Phase I , August to September 1991 = = 
 The Battle of Vukovar took place in two phases over about 90 days : from August to September 1991 , before the town was fully surrounded , and from early October to mid @-@ November , when the town was encircled then taken by the JNA . From June , the Serb forces subjected Vukovar and neighbouring villages to daily or near @-@ daily artillery and mortar fire . During July the JNA and TO began deploying in large numbers across eastern Slavonia , surrounding Vukovar on three sides . Heavy fighting began at the end of August . On 23 August Borovo Naselje came under heavy shellfire . Croatian forces shot down two Yugoslav G @-@ 2 Galeb fighter aircraft using shoulder @-@ launched anti @-@ aircraft missiles . The following day , the JNA , the Yugoslav Air Force and the Yugoslav Navy launched a major attack using aircraft , naval vessels on the Danube , tanks and artillery . The attack , which was mounted from both sides of the border , caused extensive damage and many civilian casualties . 
 The Croatian government launched an attack on JNA garrisons and arms depots throughout its territory on 14 September – an offensive dubbed the Battle of the Barracks . Vukovar 's JNA barracks was one of those attacked that day , but the local Croatian forces failed to capture it . In retaliation , Serb paramilitaries attacked areas to the southwest of Vukovar from the direction of <unk> , forcing about 2 @,@ 000 people to flee . There were reports of mass killings and scores of civilian deaths . Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter received large quantities of arms and ammunition from depots captured elsewhere , enabling them to hold the line against JNA attacks . 
 The JNA responded by launching a major offensive in eastern Slavonia , from where it intended to progress west via Vinkovci and Osijek to Zagreb . The army did not bypass Vukovar , because they wished to relieve the besieged barracks and to eliminate a possible threat to their supply lines . The JNA leadership did not intend to make Vukovar the main focus of the offensive but , as happened with Stalingrad in the Second World War , an initially inconsequential engagement became an essential political symbol for both sides . 
 On 19 September , a JNA force consisting of at least a hundred T @-@ 55 and M @-@ 84 tanks with armoured personnel carriers and heavy artillery pieces left Belgrade and crossed into Croatia near the Serbian town of Šid on 20 September . Croatian units were quickly routed and fell back to Vukovar . The JNA 's 1st Guards Mechanised Brigade quickly reached the Vukovar barracks and lifted the Croatian siege of the facility . They also moved to encircle Vukovar . By 30 September , the town was almost completely surrounded ; all roads in and out were blocked , and the only route in was via a farm track through a perilously exposed cornfield . 
 The JNA launched repeated assaults on Vukovar but failed to make any progress . Its armour , designed for combat in open country , was barely able to enter Vukovar 's narrow streets . Support from regular infantry was lacking , and the poorly trained and motivated troops of the TO were inadequate substitutes . The JNA 's soldiers appeared to have little understanding of how to conduct urban operations and its officers displayed slow and reactive decision @-@ making on the ground . 
 Croatian forces countered the JNA 's attacks by mining approach roads , sending out mobile teams equipped with anti @-@ tank weapons , deploying many snipers , and fighting back from heavily fortified positions . The JNA initially relied on massing armoured spearheads which would advance along a street in a column followed by a few companies of infantry . The defenders responded by opening fire with anti @-@ tank weapons at very close range – often as short as 20 metres ( 66 ft ) – to disable the lead and rear vehicles , trapping the rest of the column , where it could be systematically disabled . The defenders tried to avoid completely destroying enemy armour , as the materiel that they retrieved from disabled vehicles was an important source of resupply . They used a strategy of " active defence " , carrying out hit @-@ and @-@ run attacks to keep the JNA forces off balance . Anti @-@ tank and anti @-@ personnel mines hindered JNA manoeuvres . The defenders used unconventional tactics to undermine enemy morale , such as firing weather rockets at Serb forces and sabotaging JNA tanks by planting mines underneath them while they were parked at night , so that they would blow up when the crews started them in the morning . JNA casualties were heavy ; on one road , dubbed the " tank graveyard " , about a hundred JNA armoured vehicles were destroyed , fifteen of them by Croatian Colonel Marko Babić . The high casualties had a debilitating effect on morale all the way up the chain of command . 
 The JNA began launching artillery and rocket barrages against the town . By the end of the battle , over 700 @,@ 000 shells and other missiles had been fired at Vukovar at a rate of up to 12 @,@ 000 a day . It is estimated that Vukovar as well as its surroundings were bombarded with a total of over 2 @.@ 5 million shells of mortar and artillery of over 20 mm . Metre for metre , the bombardment was more intense than at Stalingrad . The thousands of civilians remaining in Vukovar took shelter from the bombardment in cellars and bomb shelters that had been built during the Cold War . 
 = = = JNA weaknesses and adoption of new tactics = = = 
 The JNA 's lack of infantry support was due to a disastrously low level of mobilisation in the preceding months . Many reservists – who were drawn from all the Yugoslav republics , including Croatia – refused to report for duty , and many serving soldiers deserted rather than fight . Serbia was never formally at war and no general mobilisation was carried out . An estimated 150 @,@ 000 Serbs went abroad to avoid conscription , and many others deserted or went into hiding . Only 13 percent of conscripts reported for duty . Another 40 @,@ 000 staged rebellions in towns across Serbia ; the Serbian newspaper <unk> commented in July 1991 that the situation was one of " total military disintegration " . 
 Morale on the battlefield was poor . JNA commanders resorted to firing on their own positions to motivate their men to fight . When the commander of a JNA unit at Vukovar demanded to know who was willing to fight and who wanted to go home , the unit split in two ; one conscript , unable to decide which side to take , shot himself on the spot . A JNA officer who served at Vukovar later described how his men refused to obey orders on several occasions , " abandoning combat vehicles , discarding weapons , gathering on some flat ground , sitting and singing Give Peace a Chance by John Lennon . " In late October , an entire infantry battalion from Novi Sad in Serbia abandoned an attack on Borovo Naselje and fled . Another group of reservists threw away their weapons and went back to Serbia on foot across a nearby bridge . A tank driver , Vladimir Živković , drove his vehicle from the front line at Vukovar to the Yugoslav parliament in Belgrade , where he parked on the steps in front of the building . He was arrested and declared insane by the authorities . His treatment enraged his colleagues , who protested by taking over a local radio station at gunpoint and issuing a declaration that " we are not traitors , but we do not want to be aggressors . " 
 In late September , Lieutenant Colonel General Života Panić was put in charge of the operation against Vukovar . He established new headquarters and command @-@ and @-@ control arrangements to resolve the disorganisation that had hindered the JNA 's operations . Panić divided the JNA forces into Northern and Southern Areas of Responsibility ( AORs ) . The northern AOR was assigned to Major General Mladen <unk> , while Colonel Mile Mrkšić was given charge of the south . As well as fresh troops , paramilitary volunteers from Serbia were brought in . They were well armed and highly motivated but often undisciplined and brutal . They were formed into units of company and battalion size as substitutes for the missing reservists . The commander of the Novi Sad corps was videotaped after the battle praising the Serb Volunteer Guard ( " Tigers " ) of Željko Ražnatović , known as " Arkan " : 
 The greatest credit for this goes to Arkan 's volunteers ! Although some people accuse me of acting in collusion with paramilitary formations , these are not paramilitary formations here ! They are men who came voluntarily to fight for the Serbian cause . We surround a village , he dashes in and kills whoever refuses to surrender . On we go ! 
 Panić combined well @-@ motivated paramilitary infantry with trained engineering units to clear mines and defensive positions , supported by heavy armour and artillery . The paramilitaries spearheaded a fresh offensive that began on 30 September . The assault succeeded in cutting the Croatian supply route to Vukovar when the village of Marinci , on the route out of the town , was captured on 1 October . Shortly afterwards , the Croatian 204th Brigade 's commander , Mile Dedaković , broke out with a small escort , slipping through the Serbian lines to reach the Croatian @-@ held town of Vinkovci . His deputy , Branko Borković , took over command of Vukovar 's defences . General Anton Tus , commander of the Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter , put Dedaković in charge of a breakthrough operation to relieve the town and launched a counter @-@ offensive on 13 October . Croatian tanks and infantry , supported by artillery , retook Marinci and drove the JNA back almost to its starting position . The counter @-@ offensive was then called off by President Tuđman , citing pressure from the European Community for a ceasefire . This enabled the JNA 's 252nd Armoured Brigade to retake the ground that it had lost . From then on the town was completely surrounded and under constant attack from the JNA . 
 = = Phase II , October to November 1991 = = 
 During the final phase of the battle , Vukovar 's remaining inhabitants , including several thousand Serbs , took refuge in cellars and communal bomb shelters , which housed up to 700 people each . A crisis committee was established , operating from a nuclear bunker underneath the municipal hospital . The committee took over the running of the town and organised the delivery of food , water and medical supplies . It kept the number of civilians on the streets to a minimum and ensured that each shelter was guarded and had at least one doctor and nurse assigned to it . 
 The hospital had to deal with hundreds of wounded people – between sixteen and eighty each day , three quarters of them civilians , in the second half of September . Even though the building was marked with the Red Cross , it was struck by over eight hundred shells during the battle . Much of the building was wrecked , and the staff and patients had to relocate to underground service corridors . The intensive care unit was moved into the building 's nuclear bomb shelter . On 4 October , the Yugoslav Air Force attacked the hospital , destroying its operating theatre . One bomb fell through several floors , failed to explode and landed on the foot of a wounded man , without injuring him . One of the hospital doctors later asked in Serbia why the hospital had been attacked ; he was told : " Because you held wounded Croatian soldiers there . " 
 Croatian forces adapted several Antonov An @-@ 2 biplanes to drop supplies by parachute on Vukovar . The aircraft also dropped improvised bombs made of fuel cans and boilers filled with explosive and metal bars . The crews used GPS to find the target , then pushed the payloads out of the side door . One of the aircraft was shot down by an SA @-@ 6 missile , killing Marko Živković , the commander of the air unit . 
 The European Community attempted to provide humanitarian aid to the 12 @,@ 000 civilians trapped within the perimeter , but only one aid convoy made it through . Croatian forces suspended military action to allow the convoy to pass on 12 October , but the JNA used the pause as cover to make further military gains . After the convoy set off , the JNA delayed it for two days and used the time to lay mines , bring in reinforcements and consolidate JNA control of the road out of Vukovar . When the convoy arrived , it delivered medical supplies to the hospital at Vukovar and evacuated 114 injured civilians . 
 On 16 October , the JNA mounted a major attack against Borovo Naselje . It achieved some gains , but became bogged down in the face of determined Croatian resistance . On 30 October , the JNA launched a fully coordinated assault , spearheaded by paramilitary forces , with infantry and engineering troops systematically forcing their way through the Croatian defences . The JNA forces , divided into northern and southern operations sectors , attacked several points simultaneously and pushed back the defenders . The JNA also adopted new tactics , such as firing directly into houses and then driving tanks through them , using tear gas and smoke bombs to drive out the defenders , and using anti @-@ tank and anti @-@ aircraft guns to capture the town building by building . This enabled the Serb forces to flush out the defenders , inflicting heavy casualties . 
 On 2 November , the JNA reached the strategic suburb of Lužac , between Borovo Naselje and Vukovar , cutting one of the two roads linking the town centre with its northern suburb . Meanwhile , the ZNG ( which had been renamed the Croatian Army ) attempted to retake the villages of Marinci and <unk> to reopen the supply route to Vukovar . It mounted a heavy bombardment of the JNA 's access routes to Vukovar and a tank attack on JNA lines . JNA General Mladen <unk> was killed on 4 November when his tank was hit by a shell , but the JNA 's advantage in artillery and rockets enabled it to halt the Croatian advance and inflict heavy casualties . 
 = = = Fall of Vukovar = = = 
 JNA troops launched an amphibious assault across the Danube north of Lužac on 3 November to link up with Arkan 's paramilitary " Tigers " . This attack split the Croatian perimeter in half and divided the main group of defenders in the town centre from a smaller stronghold in Borovo Naselje . The JNA 's Operational Group South now began to systematically clear the town centre , cutting off the remaining groups of defenders . They captured a key hilltop , <unk> <unk> ( Mill Hill ) , on 9 November , giving them a clear view of the town . The assault was largely led by paramilitary troops , with JNA and TO soldiers providing support , especially in demining operations and close artillery support . The Croatian @-@ held village of Bogdanovci , just to the west of Vukovar , fell on 10 November . On 13 November the JNA cut the last link between Borovo Naselje and Vukovar . Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter mounted a last @-@ ditch attempt to break the siege by attacking from the village of Nuštar , but the JNA again repelled them . 
 By now , the defenders were running out of ammunition and were exhausted from fighting around the clock without any prospect of being relieved or replacing their dead and wounded . They had been reduced to three separate pockets . With defeat now inevitable , several hundred Croatian soldiers and civilians attempted to break out over the course of several days , as the JNA mounted its final offensive . Most of those in Borovo Naselje were unable to break out and were killed . On 18 November , the last defenders in Vukovar 's town centre surrendered . 
 Many of Vukovar 's civilian inhabitants were living in squalid conditions and nearing starvation . One woman told UN Special Envoy Cyrus Vance that she had spent the last two months in a bomb shelter with her five children without toilets or water for washing . They lived on two slices of bread and a piece of pâté per day . One of Vukovar 's defenders described conditions as the battle reached its peak : 
 By early October , there were no cigarettes . People were smoking grape leaves or tea . There was no yeast for bread . My son was eating tinned food with me and my wife . There was less and less of that . The shelling became 24 hours a day , and the cease @-@ fires were worse . When people came out of the shelters to go to the well during the cease @-@ fires , the snipers shot them . You can 't keep children in for two months , and when they ran outside , when there was sun in the morning , they shot at them , too . 
 When the battle ended , the scale of the destruction came as a shock to many who not been out of their shelters in weeks . Siniša Glavašević , a reporter for Croatian Radio and a native of Vukovar , who had stayed in the town throughout the battle , described the scene as the survivors emerged : 
 The picture of Vukovar at the 22nd hour of the 87th day [ of the siege ] will stay forever in the memory of those who witnessed it . Unearthly scenes are endless , the smell of burning , under the feet the remnants of old roof tiles , building materials , glass , ruins , and a dreadful silence . ... We hope that the torments of Vukovar are over . 
 Although the fighting was over in the centre of Vukovar , sporadic combat continued for several more days elsewhere in the shattered town . Some defenders continued to resist until 20 November and a few managed to slip away from Borovo Naselje as late as 23 November . 
 Foreign journalists and international monitors entered the town soon after the surrender and recorded what they saw . Blaine Harden of the Washington Post wrote : 
 Not one roof , door or wall in all of Vukovar seems to have escaped jagged gouges or gaping holes left by shrapnel , bullets , bombs or artillery shells – all delivered as part of a three @-@ month effort by Serb insurgents and the Serb @-@ led Yugoslav army to wrest the city from its Croatian defenders . Not one building appears habitable , or even repairable . Nearly every tree has been chopped to bits by firepower . 
 Chuck <unk> of The New York Times reported : 
 Only soldiers of the Serbian @-@ dominated army , stray dogs and a few journalists walked the smoky , rubble @-@ choked streets amid the ruins of the apartment buildings , stores and hotel in Vukovar 's center . Not one of the buildings seen during a daylong outing could be described as habitable . In one park , shell fire had sheared thick trees in half like blades of grass cut by a mower . Across the street , the dome of an Orthodox Christian church had fallen onto the altar . Automatic weapons fire erupted every few minutes as the prowling Serbian soldiers , some of them drunk , took aim at land mines , pigeons and windows that had survived the fighting . 
 Laura Silber and the BBC 's Allan Little described how " corpses of people and animals littered the streets . Grisly skeletons of buildings still burned , barely a square inch had escaped damage . Serbian volunteers , wild @-@ eyed , roared down the streets , their pockets full of looted treasures . " The JNA celebrated its victory , as Marc Champion of The Independent described : 
 The colonels who ran " Operation Vukovar " entertained more than 100 journalists inside the ruins of the <unk> Hotel at a kind of Mad Hatter 's victory celebration . They handed out picture postcards of the old Vukovar as mementoes and served drinks on starched white tablecloths , as wind and rain blew in through shattered windows ... Inside the <unk> Hotel was an Alice in Wonderland world where Colonel [ Miodrag ] <unk> announced that the gaping holes in the walls had been blasted by the Croatian defenders . They had placed sticks of dynamite in the brickwork to make the army look bad , he said .

 Croatian forces and civilians suffered heavy casualties . The Croatian side initially reported 1 @,@ 798 killed — civilians and soldiers — in the siege of the city . Croatian general Anton Tus later stated that about 1 @,@ 100 of Vukovar 's defenders were killed and 2 @,@ 600 defenders and civilians were listed as missing ; another 1 @,@ 000 Croatian soldiers were killed on the approaches to Vinkovci and Osijek . He noted that the intensity of the fighting can be judged by the fact that the losses in eastern Slavonia between September and November 1991 constituted half of all Croatian war casualties during the whole of 1991 . According to figures published in 2006 by the Croatian Ministry of Defence , 879 Croatian soldiers were killed and 770 wounded in Vukovar . The Central Intelligence Agency estimates Croatian casualties at around 4 @,@ 000 to 5 @,@ 000 dead across eastern Slavonia . The 204th Vukovar Brigade lost over 60 percent of its strength in the battle . Croatian officials have given figures of 2 @,@ 000 killed , 800 missing , 3 @,@ 000 taken prisoner and 42 @,@ 852 made refugees in eastern Slavonia as a whole . 
 = = = Serbian and Yugoslav = = = 
 Although JNA losses were undoubtedly substantial , the exact numbers are unclear because of a lack of official data . The JNA officially acknowledged 1 @,@ 279 killed in action , including 177 officers , during the entire war in Croatia . According to Anton Tus , the JNA 's Novi Sad corps alone lost 1 @,@ 300 soldiers during the campaign in eastern Slavonia . He extrapolates from this to estimate that between 6 @,@ 000 and 8 @,@ 000 soldiers and volunteers died in eastern Slavonia , with the loss of 600 armoured vehicles and heavy weapons and over 20 aircraft . 
 Serbian sources disagree with this assessment . General Andrija <unk> , the former commander of the Novi Sad corps , has said there were " [ not ] more than 1 @,@ 500 killed on our side . " The Serbian journalist Miroslav <unk> , who has close links with the Serbian military , wrote in the Belgrade newspaper Večernje novosti that " on the side of the JNA , Territorial Defence and volunteer units , exactly 1 @,@ 103 members were killed . " He cited losses of 110 armoured vehicles and two combat aircraft shot down , plus another destroyed due to technical failure . However , the actual number may have been considerably greater as casualties were consistently underreported during the war . 
 = = War crimes = = 
 Many of those captured in Vukovar , both soldiers and civilians , were killed . Serb paramilitaries roamed the streets looking for Croats to kill and carried out numerous summary executions . Journalists witnessed one such killing in Vukovar 's main street and also reported seeing the streets strewn with bodies in civilian clothes . BBC television reporters recorded Serbian paramilitaries chanting : " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> nam <unk> , <unk> mesa , <unk> mesa , <unk> <unk> ! " ( " Slobodan [ Milošević ] , Slobodan , send us some salad , [ for ] there will be meat , there will be meat , we will slaughter Croats " ) . A Serbian journalist embedded with the JNA reserve forces in Vukovar later reported : 
 After Vukovar fell , people were lined up and made to walk to detention areas . As the prisoners walked by , local Serbian paramilitaries pulled people out of the lines at random , claiming that they had to be executed because they were " war criminals . " Most of these people were Croats who had spent the duration of the fighting in basements , particularly in the Vukovar hospital . The selection of those who were to be executed also was done as these people were leaving the shelters . They were removed from lines under the supervision , and with the apparent permission , of Major Veselin Šljivančanin , the JNA officer in charge of security after Vukovar 's fall . 
 Around 400 people in Vukovar 's hospital – non @-@ Serb patients , medical personnel , local political figures and others who had taken refuge there – were taken from the hospital by the JNA . Although some were subsequently released , around 200 were taken to a nearby Ovčara camp and were executed in what became known as the Vukovar massacre . At least fifty others were taken somewhere else and were never seen again . Thousands more people were transferred by the JNA to prison camps elsewhere in Serb @-@ controlled Croatia and in Serbia proper . Further mass killings followed ; at Dalj , north of Vukovar , where many inhabitants were previously massacred , numerous prisoners from Vukovar were subjected to harsh interrogations , beatings and torture , and at least 35 were killed . The JNA imprisoned two thousand people in the Velepromet industrial facility in Vukovar . Eight hundred were classified by the JNA as prisoners of war . Many were brutally interrogated , several were shot on the spot by TO members and paramilitaries , and others were sent to Ovčara where they were killed in the massacre . The remaining prisoners were transferred to a JNA @-@ run prison camp at Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia , where they were stripped naked on arrival , beaten and interrogated , and forced to sleep for weeks on bare wooden floors . Most were released in January 1992 under an agreement brokered by UN envoy Cyrus Vance . Others were kept prisoner until mid @-@ 1992 . Serbs who had fought to defend Vukovar were particularly harshly treated and were subjected to savage beatings because their captors considered them to be traitors . 
 Detainees who were not suspected of involvement with the Croatian armed forces were evacuated from Vukovar to other locations in Serbia and Croatia . The non @-@ Serb population of Vukovar and the surrounding region was systematically ethnically cleansed and 31 @,@ 732 people were forced to leave their homes in the Vukovar district , adding to the tens of thousands already expelled from across eastern Slavonia . 2 @,@ 600 people disappeared following the fall of the town , of whom around 550 are still missing . There were also incidents of war rape , for which two soldiers were later convicted . 
 Serb forces singled out a number of prominent individuals . Among them was Dr. Vesna Bosanac , the director of the town 's hospital , who was regarded as a heroine in Croatia but demonised by the Serbian media . She and her husband were taken to Sremska Mitrovica prison , where she was locked up in a single room with 66 other women for several weeks . Her husband was subjected to repeated beatings . After appeals from the International Committee of the Red Cross , the couple were eventually released in a prisoner exchange . The Croatian Radio journalist Siniša Glavašević , whose broadcasts had become iconic in Croatia , was taken to Ovčara , severely beaten and shot along with the other victims of the massacre . 
 Vukovar was systematically looted after its capture . A JNA soldier who fought at Vukovar told the Serbian newspaper Dnevni <unk> that " the Chetnik [ paramilitaries ] behaved like professional plunderers , they knew what to look for in the houses they looted . " The JNA also participated in the looting ; an official in the Serbian Ministry of Defence commented : " Tell me of even one reservist , especially if he is an officer , who has spent more than a month at the front and has not brought back a fine car filled with everything that would fit inside the car . " The Serb forces looted more than 8 @,@ 000 artworks from Vukovar , including the contents of the municipal museum , Eltz Castle , which was bombed and destroyed during the siege . Serbia returned 2 @,@ 000 pieces of looted art in December 2001 . 
 = = = Indictments and trials = = = 
 Three JNA officers , Mile Mrkšić ; Veselin Šljivančanin ; and Miroslav Radić , were indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) on multiple counts of crimes against humanity and violations of the laws of war , having surrendered or been captured during 2002 and 2003 . On 27 September 2007 , Mrkšić was sentenced by the ICTY to 20 years ' imprisonment for murder and torture , and Šljivančanin was sentenced to five years ' imprisonment on charges of torture . Radić was acquitted . Šljivančanin 's sentence was increased to 17 years on appeal , then reduced again to ten years after a second appeal , and he was granted early release in July 2011 . Slavko Dokmanović , the Serb mayor of Vukovar , was also indicted and arrested for his role in the massacre , but committed suicide in June 1998 , shortly before judgement was to be announced . 
 The Serbian paramilitary leader Vojislav Šešelj was indicted on war crimes charges , including several counts of extermination , for the Vukovar hospital massacre , in which his " White Eagles " were allegedly involved . In March 2016 , Šešelj was acquitted on all counts pending appeal . Croatia also indicted a number of Serbs for war crimes committed in Vukovar . In December 2005 , a Serbian court convicted fourteen former paramilitaries for their involvement in the hospital massacre . The ICTY linked Željko " Arkan " Ražnatović to the massacre , but he was assassinated in Belgrade before he could be brought to trial . 
 The ICTY indictment of Slobodan Milošević characterised the overall JNA and Serb offensive in Croatia – including the fighting in eastern Slavonia – as a " joint criminal enterprise " to remove non @-@ Serb populations from Serb @-@ inhabited areas of Croatia . Milošević was charged with numerous crimes against humanity , violations of the laws of war , and breaches of the Geneva Conventions in relation to the battle of Vukovar and its aftermath . He died in March 2006 , before his trial could be completed . The Croatian Serb leader Goran Hadžić was indicted for " wanton destruction of homes , religious and cultural buildings " and " devastation not justified by military necessity " across eastern Slavonia , and for deporting Vukovar 's non @-@ Serb population . He was arrested in July 2011 , after seven years on the run , and has pleaded not guilty to fourteen counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity . 
 Croatian courts indicted Veljko Kadijević and Blagoje Adžić , former commanders of the Yugoslav Army , for war crimes in Vukovar . Adžić died of natural causes in Belgrade in March 2012 , and never faced trial . Kadijević fled Yugoslavia following Milošević 's overthrow and sought asylum in Russia . He was granted Russian citizenship in 2008 , and died in Moscow in November 2014 . In 2011 , a Serbian court indicted more than 40 Croatians for alleged war crimes committed in Vukovar , but an earlier indictment against a Croatian soldier was dropped because of irregularities in the investigation . 
 In 1999 , Croatia sued Yugoslavia before the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , claiming genocide had been committed in Vukovar . At Serbia and Montenegro 's dissolution in 2006 , this suit was passed on to Serbia . In February 2015 , the ICJ ruled that the battle of Vukovar and the ensuing massacre did not constitute genocide , though it confirmed that serious crimes had been committed by the JNA and Serb paramilitaries . 
 = = Political aspects = = 
 = = = Propaganda = = = 
 The Serbian and Croatian media waged a fierce propaganda battle over the progress and reasons for the battle . Both sides ' propaganda machines aimed to promote ultranationalist sentiments and denigrate the other side with no pretence of objectivity or self @-@ criticism . Croatian media described the Serbian forces as " Serb terrorists " and a " Serbo @-@ Communist army of occupation " intent on crushing a thousand @-@ year dream of an independent Croatia . The propaganda reached peak intensity in the wake of Vukovar 's fall . The Croatian newspaper Novi list denounced the Serbs as " cannibals " and " brutal Serb extremists " , while the Serbian media depicted the JNA and Serbian forces as " liberators " and " defenders " of the Serbian people , and the Croatian forces as " <unk> hordes " , " blackshirts " , " militants " and " drunk and stoned monsters " . There were overt appeals to racial and gender prejudice , including claims that the Croatian defenders had " put on female dress to escape from the town " and had recruited " black men " . 
 Victim status became a central aim for the propaganda machines of both sides , and the battle was used to support claims of atrocities . Victims became interchangeable as anonymous victims were identified as Croats on Zagreb television and as Serbs on Belgrade TV . According to the Serbian opposition periodical Republika , the state @-@ owned station TV Novi Sad was under orders to identify any bodies its reporters filmed as being " Serbian corpses " . After the battle , Belgrade television showed pictures of hundreds of corpses lined up outside Vukovar 's hospital and claimed that they were Serbs who had been " massacred " by Croatians . According to Human Rights Watch , the bodies belonged to those who had died of their injuries at the hospital , whose staff had been prevented from burying them by the intense Serbian bombardment , and had been forced to leave them lying in the open . Serbian television continued to broadcast claims of " massacred Serbs in Vukovar " for some time after the fall of the town . 
 Such victim @-@ centred propaganda had a powerful motivating effect . One Serbian volunteer said that he had never seen the town before the war , but had come to fight because " the Croats had a network of catacombs under the city where they killed and tortured children just because they were Serbs . " Reuters reported erroneously that forty @-@ one children had been massacred in Vukovar by Croatian soldiers ; although the claim was retracted a day later , it was used by the Serbian media to justify military action against Croatia . Many of those fighting at Vukovar believed that they were engaged in a struggle to liberate the town from a hostile occupier . 
 = = = International reaction = = = 
 The international community made repeated unsuccessful attempts to end the fighting . Both sides violated ceasefires , often within hours . Calls by some European Community members for the Western European Union to intervene militarily were vetoed by the United Kingdom . Instead , a Conference for Yugoslavia was established under the chairmanship of Lord Carrington to find a way to end the conflict . The United Nations ( UN ) imposed an arms embargo on all of the Yugoslav republics in September 1991 under Security Council Resolution 713 , but this was ineffective , in part because the JNA had no need to import weapons . The European powers abandoned attempts to keep Yugoslavia united and agreed to recognise the independence of Croatia and Slovenia on 15 January 1992 . 
 International observers tried unsuccessfully to prevent the human rights abuses that followed the battle . A visit by UN envoys Marrack Goulding and Cyrus Vance was systematically obstructed by the JNA . Vance 's demands to see the hospital , from which wounded patients were being dragged out to be killed , were rebuffed by one of the massacre 's creators , Major Veselin Šljivančanin . The major also blocked Red Cross representatives in an angry confrontation recorded by TV cameras : " This is my country , we have conquered this . This is Yugoslavia , and I am in command here ! " 
 There was no international media presence in Vukovar , as there was in the simultaneous Siege of Dubrovnik and the later Siege of Sarajevo , and relatively little of the fighting in Vukovar was broadcast to foreign audiences . British journalist Misha Glenny commented that the JNA , the Croatian Serb government and many ordinary Serbs were often hostile to the foreign media ; the Croatians presented a much more open and friendly attitude . 
 = = = Croatian reaction = = = 
 The Croatian media gave heavy coverage to the battle , repeatedly airing broadcasts from the besieged town by the journalist Siniša Glavašević . Much popular war art focused on the " <unk> " , as posters dubbed it . The Croatian government began suppressing Glavašević 's broadcasts when it became clear that defeat was inevitable , despite the confident slogans of " Vukovar shall not fall " and " Vukovar must not fall . " Two of the main daily newspapers , Večernji list and Novi list , failed to report the loss of Vukovar and , on 20 November , two days after it had fallen , repeated the official line that the fight was still continuing . News of the surrender was dismissed as Serbian propaganda . Nevertheless , many people saw Western satellite broadcasts showing the ruined town and Serbian soldiers taking its inhabitants into custody . When the surrender could no longer be denied , the two newspapers interpreted the loss as a demonstration of Croatian bravery and resistance , blaming the international community for not intervening to help Croatia . 
 The Croatian government was criticised for its approach to the battle . Surviving defenders and right @-@ wing political parties accused it of betrayal and of deliberately sacrificing Vukovar to secure international recognition for Croatia . The only explanation that many people were willing to accept for the town 's fall was that it had been given up as part of a conspiracy . The commanders of the Croatian forces in Vukovar , Mile Dedaković and Branko Borković , both survived the battle and spoke out publicly against the government 's actions . In an apparent attempt to silence them , both men were briefly detained by Croatian military police , and the Croatian government suppressed an issue of the newspaper <unk> <unk> that published a transcript of a telephone call from Vukovar , in which Dedaković had pleaded with an evasive Tuđman for military assistance . The revelations caused public outrage and reinforced perceptions that the defenders had been betrayed . 
 From a military point of view , the outcome at Vukovar was not a disaster for Croatia 's overall war effort . The battle broke the back of the JNA offensive and left Croatia 's main adversary exhausted and unable to press its offensive deeper into the country . Vukovar was probably indefensible , being almost surrounded by Serb @-@ held territory and closer to Belgrade than to Zagreb , and although the defeat was damaging to morale , in a strategic context the damage and delays inflicted on the JNA more than made up for the loss of the town . 
 Following the battle , Vukovar became a symbol of Croatian resistance and suffering . The survivors , veterans and journalists wrote numerous memoirs , songs and testimonies about the battle and its symbolism , calling it variously " the phenomenon " , " the pride " , " the hell " and " the Croatian knight " . Writers appealed to the " Vukovar principle " , the " spirituality of Vukovar " and " Vukovar ethics " , the qualities said to have been exhibited by the defenders and townspeople . Croatian war veterans were presented with medals bearing the name of Vukovar . In 1994 , when Croatia replaced the Croatian dinar with its new currency , the kuna , it used the destroyed Eltz Castle in Vukovar and the Vučedol Dove – an artefact from an ancient Neolithic culture centred on eastern Slavonia , which was discovered near Vukovar – on the new 20 @-@ kuna note . The imagery emphasises the Croatian nature of Vukovar , at the time under Serbian control . During 1993 – 94 , there was a national debate on how Vukovar should be rebuilt when it was recovered ; some Croatians even proposed that it should be preserved as a monument . 
 The ruling HDZ made extensive use of popular culture relating to Vukovar as propaganda in the years before the region was reintegrated into Croatia . In 1997 , President Tuđman mounted a tour of eastern Slavonia , accompanied by a musical campaign called <unk> <unk> <unk> za Vukovar ( " All Croatian victories for Vukovar " ) . The campaign was commemorated by the release of a compilation of patriotic music from Croatia Records . When Vukovar was returned to Croatian control in 1998 , its recovery was hailed as the completion of a long struggle for freedom and Croatian national identity . Tuđman alluded to such sentiments when he gave a speech in Vukovar to mark its reintegration into Croatia : 
 Our arrival in Vukovar – the symbol of Croatian suffering , Croatian resistance , Croatian aspirations for freedom , Croatian desire to return to its eastern borders on the Danube , of which the Croatian national anthem sings – is a sign of our determination to really achieve peace and reconciliation . 
 = = = Serbian reaction = = = 
 Although the battle had been fought in the name of Serbian defence and unity , reactions in Serbia were deeply divided . The JNA , the state @-@ controlled Serbian media and Serbian ultra @-@ nationalists hailed the victory as a triumph . The JNA even erected a triumphal arch in Belgrade through which its returning soldiers could march , and officers were congratulated for taking " the toughest and fiercest Ustaša fortress " . The Serbian newspaper Politika ran a front @-@ page headline on 20 November announcing : " Vukovar Finally Free " . In January 1992 , from the ruins of Vukovar , the ultranationalist painter Milić Stanković wrote an article for the Serbian periodical Pogledi ( " Viewpoints " ) , in which he declared : " Europe must know Vukovar was liberated from the Croat Nazis . They were helped by Central European scum . They crawled from under the papal tiara , as a dart of the serpent 's tongue that protruded from the bloated Kraut and overstretched <unk> anus . " 
 The Serbian geographer Jovan Ilić set out a vision for the future of the region , envisaging it being annexed to Serbia and its expelled Croatian population being replaced with Serbs from elsewhere in Croatia . The redrawing of Serbia 's borders would unite all Serbs in a single state , and would cure Croats of opposition to Serbian nationalism , which Ilić termed an " ethno @-@ psychic disorder " ; thus , " the new borders should primarily be a therapy for the treatment of ethno @-@ psychic disorders , primarily among the Croatian population . " Other Serbian nationalist writers acknowledged that historical evidence was that eastern Slavonia had been Croatian for centuries , but blamed the Croatian majority in the region on " conversion to Catholicism , <unk> and <unk> " plus " genocidal destruction " . Most irredentist propaganda focused on the region 's proximity to Serbia and the large number of Serbs who inhabited the area . 
 The Croatian Serb leadership also took a positive view of the outcome . During the rule of the Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) between 1991 and 1995 , the fall of Vukovar on 18 November 1991 was officially commemorated as " Liberation Day " . It was portrayed as a successful struggle by local Serbs to defend their lives and property from the aggression of the Croatian state . Thousands of Vukovar 's Serbs had suffered alongside their Croatian neighbours , sheltering in basements or bomb shelters for three months in appalling conditions , but after their " liberation " they were denigrated as the <unk> , the " people from the basement " . The Serb civilian dead were denied recognition , and the only people buried in the Serbian memorial cemetery at Vukovar were local Serbs who had fought with or alongside the JNA . 
 In contrast , many people in Serbia were strongly opposed to the battle and the wider war and resisted efforts by the state to involve them in the conflict . When the JNA tried to call up reservists , parents and relatives gathered around JNA barracks to prevent their children taking part in the operation . Resistance to conscription became widespread across Serbia , ranging from individual acts of defiance to collective mutinies by hundreds of reservists at a time . Serbian opposition politicians condemned the war : <unk> <unk> of the Democratic Party accused Slobodan Milošević of " using the conflict to cling to power " and Vuk Drašković , leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement , appealed to JNA soldiers to " pick up their guns and run " from the front line . After the fall of Vukovar he condemned what had been done in the name of Yugoslavia , writing in the daily newspaper Borba : 
 I cannot applaud the Vukovar victory , which is so euphorically celebrated in the war propaganda of intoxicated Serbia . I cannot , for I won 't violate the victims , thousands of dead , nor the pain and misfortune of all Vukovar survivors ... [ Vukovar ] is the Hiroshima of both Croatian and Serbian madness ... Everyone in this state , Serbs but especially Croats , have established days of the greatest shame and fall . 
 By late December 1991 , just over a month after victory had been proclaimed in Vukovar , opinion polls found that 64 percent wanted to end the war immediately and only 27 percent were willing to continue the war . Milošević and other senior Serbian figures decided against continuing the fighting , as they saw it as politically impossible to mobilise more conscripts to fight in Croatia . Desertions from the JNA continued and the well @-@ motivated and increasingly well @-@ equipped Croatian Army was becoming increasingly difficult to counter . By the end of 1991 , Serbian politicians and JNA leaders alike had concluded that it would be counter @-@ productive to continue the war . The looming conflict in Bosnia also required that the military resources tied up in Croatia be freed for future use . 
 Although the battle was publicly portrayed as a triumph , behind the scenes it profoundly affected the JNA 's character and leadership . The army 's leaders realised that they had overestimated their ability to pursue operations against heavily defended urban targets . The central Croatian town of Gospić , for instance , was a strategic target of the JNA but was now assessed as potentially a " second Vukovar " . The " <unk> " of the army was greatly accelerated , and , by the end of 1991 , it was estimated to be 90 percent Serb . Its formerly pro @-@ communist , pan @-@ Yugoslav identity was abandoned , and new officers were now advised to " love , above all else , their unit , their army and their homeland – Serbia and Montenegro " . The JNA 's failure enabled the Serbian government to tighten its control over the military , whose leadership was purged and replaced with pro @-@ Milošević nationalists . After the battle , General Veljko Kadijević , commander of the JNA , was forced into retirement for " health reasons " , and in early 1992 , another 38 generals and other officers were forced to retire , with several put on trial for incompetence and treason . 
 Many individual JNA soldiers who took part in the battle were revolted by what they had seen and protested to their superiors about the behaviour of the paramilitaries . Colonel Milorad <unk> later commented that " they simply do not want to die for such things " . The slaughter that they witnessed at Vukovar led some to experience subsequent feelings of trauma and guilt . A JNA veteran told a journalist from the Arabic newspaper Asharq Al @-@ Awsat : 
 'I was in the Army and I did my duty . Vukovar was more of a slaughter than a battle . Many women and children were killed . Many , many . ' I asked him : ' Did you take part in the killing ? ' He answered : ' I deserted . ' I asked him : ' But did you kill anyone ? ' He replied : ' I deserted after that ... The slaughter of Vukovar continues to haunt me . Every night I imagine that the war has reached my home and that my own children are being <unk>

He called it their " right and duty " to resist the " evil deeds " being committed in Croatia and said : " Let those who want it , wage it . We do not want this war . " When JNA troops transferred to the front via the Višegrad region of north @-@ eastern Bosnia , local Bosnian Croats and Muslims set up barricades and machine @-@ gun posts . They halted a column of 60 JNA tanks but were dispersed by force the following day . More than 1 @,@ 000 people had to flee the area . This action , nearly seven months before the start of the Bosnian War , caused the first casualties of the Yugoslav Wars in Bosnia . 
 Macedonia 's parliament adopted a declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in January 1991 , but it did not take effect until a referendum in September 1991 confirmed it . A group of Macedonian JNA officers secretly sought to prevent soldiers from Macedonia being sent to Croatia , and busloads of soldiers ' parents , funded by the Macedonian government , travelled to Montenegro to find their sons and bring them home . Meanwhile , Macedonians continued to be conscripted into the JNA and serve in the war in Croatia . The commander of JNA forces in the first phase of the battle , Gen. Aleksandar <unk> , was a Macedonian ; his ethnicity was probably a significant factor in the decision to replace him with Života Panić , a Serb . In 2005 , the Macedonian Army 's Chief of Staff , Gen. Miroslav <unk> , became the focus of international controversy after it was alleged that he had been involved in possible war crimes following the battle .

 Vukovar suffered catastrophic damage in the battle . Croatian officials estimated that 90 percent of Vukovar 's housing stock was damaged or destroyed , 15 @,@ 000 housing units in total and put the cost at $ 2 @.@ 5 billion . The town barely recovered during its seven years under Serb control . Marcus Tanner of The Independent described post @-@ battle Vukovar as : 
 a silent , ghostly landscape , consisting of mile upon mile of bricks , rusting cars , collapsed roofs , telegraph poles and timber beams poking out from the rubble . The wind whistles through the deserted warehouses along the river front . By next spring , grass and saplings will be sprouting and birds nesting in these piles , and hope of rebuilding will be over . 
 When Michael Ignatieff visited Vukovar in 1992 , he found the inhabitants living in squalor : 
 Such law and order as there is administered by warlords . There is little gasoline , so ... everyone goes about on foot . Old peasant women forage for fuel in the woods , because there is no heating oil . Food is scarce , because the men are too busy fighting to tend the fields . In the desolate wastes in front of the bombed @-@ out high rise flats , survivors dig at the ground with hoes . Every man goes armed . 
 The population increased to about 20 @,@ 000 as Serb refugees from other parts of Croatia and Bosnia were relocated by RSK authorities . They initially lived without water or electricity , in damaged buildings patched up with plastic sheeting and wooden boards . Residents scavenged the ruins for fragments of glass that they could stick back together to make windows for themselves . The main sources of income were war profiteering and smuggling , though some were able to find jobs in eastern Slavonia 's revived oil industry . Reconstruction was greatly delayed by economic sanctions and lack of international aid . 
 After the Erdut Agreement was signed in 1995 , the United Nations Transitional Authority for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium ( UNTAES ) was established to enable the return of Croatian refugees and to prepare the region for reintegration into Croatia . This UN peacekeeping force provided security during the transition period between 1996 and 1998 . It was only in 1999 that Croats began returning to Vukovar in significant numbers , and many of the pre @-@ war inhabitants never returned . By March 2001 , the municipality was recorded as having 31 @,@ 670 inhabitants – less than half the pre @-@ war total – of whom 18 @,@ 199 ( 57 @.@ 46 % ) were Croats and 10 @,@ 412 ( 32 @.@ 88 % ) were Serbs . The community did not recover its mixed character : Croats and Serbs now lived separate social lives . Public facilities such as shops , cafés , restaurants , sports clubs , schools , non @-@ governmental organisations and radio stations were re @-@ established on segregated lines , with separate facilities for each community . 
 Although the Croatian government sponsored reconstruction efforts in and around Vukovar , the Serb @-@ populated town centre remained in ruins until 2003 . Both Croat and Serb residents believed the government had neglected it deliberately , in order to punish the Serb community . Human Rights Watch noted that , of 4 @,@ 000 homes that had been rebuilt , none of them were inhabited by Serbs . Unemployment was high because of the destruction of the town 's major industries , and many of the inhabitants could not sell their houses . Most houses and many of Vukovar 's historic buildings had been restored by 2011 . 
 = = Commemorations and memorials = = 
 Signs of the battle are still widely apparent in Vukovar , where many buildings remain visibly scarred by bullets and shrapnel . The riverside water tower has been preserved in its badly damaged state as a memorial . The town hospital presents an exhibition and reconstruction of the conditions in the building during the battle . At Ovčara , the site of the massacre is marked by a mass grave and exhibition about the atrocity . Local tourist guides , some of whom lived through the battle , offer tourists the opportunity to visit these and other sites on walking and bicycle tours . 
 Every November , Vukovar 's authorities hold four days of festivities to commemorate the fall of the town , culminating in a " Procession of Memory " held on 18 November . This represents the expulsion of the town 's Croatian inhabitants and involves a five @-@ kilometre ( 3 @.@ 1 mile ) walk from the city 's hospital to the Croatian Memorial Cemetery of Homeland War Victims . It is attended by tens of thousands of people from across Croatia . 
 Local Serbs have avoided participating in the Croatian commemorations , often preferring either to leave the town or stay indoors on 18 November . They have held a separate low @-@ key commemoration at the Serbian military cemetery on 17 November , until 2003 and on 18 November since then . The RSK @-@ era term " Liberation Day " has been dropped , but the Serbs also avoid the Croatian terminology , instead calling it simply " 18 November " . 
 The issue of how to remember the Serbian dead has posed particular difficulties . Local Serbs who died fighting alongside the JNA were buried by the Croatian Serb authorities on a plot of land where Croatian houses had once stood . The gravestones were originally topped with a sculptural evocation of the V @-@ shaped Serbian military cap , or šajkača . After Vukovar 's reintegration into Croatia , the gravestones were repeatedly vandalised . The Serb community replaced them with more neutral gravestones without overt military connotations . 
 Vukovar Serbs report feeling marginalised and excluded from places associated with Croatian nationalist sentiment , such as monuments to the Croatian defenders . The Croatian sociologist Kruno Kardov gives the example of a prominent memorial , a large cross made from white stone , where the Vuka flows into the Danube . According to Kardov , Serbs rarely if ever go there , and they feel great stress if they do . A Serb boy spoke of how he wanted to know what was written on the monument but was too frightened to go and read the inscription ; one day he got up the courage , ran to the monument , read it and immediately ran back to " safety " . As Kardov puts it , Vukovar remains divided by an " invisible boundary line ... inscribed only on the cognitive map of the members of one particular group . " 
 The battle is widely commemorated across Croatia . Almost every town has streets named after Vukovar , and the lead vessel of the Croatian Navy 's two new Helsinki @-@ class missile boats was named the Vukovar in January 2009 . The Croatian Parliament has declared 18 November to be the " Remembrance Day of the Sacrifice of Vukovar in 1991 " , when " all those who participated in the defence of the city of Vukovar – the symbol of Croatian freedom – are appropriately honoured with dignity . " 
 As a symbol of Croatia 's national identity , Vukovar has become a place of pilgrimage for people from across Croatia who seek to evoke feelings of " vicarious <unk> " , as Kruno Kardov described them , in the suffering endured during the country 's war of independence . Some gather in front of the town 's main memorial cross on New Year 's Eve to pray as the year ends , though such sentiments have attracted criticism from local Croats for not allowing them to " rejoice for even a single night " , as one put it . The town has thus become , in Kardov 's words , " the embodiment of a pure Croatian identity " and the battle " the foundational myth of the Croatian state " . This has led to it becoming as much an " imagined place " , a receptacle for Croatian national sentiment and symbolism , as a real place . Kardov concludes that it is questionable whether Vukovar can realise a vision of once again becoming " one place for all its citizens " . 
 In November 2010 , Boris Tadić became the first President of Serbia to travel to Vukovar , when he visited the massacre site at Ovčara and expressed his " apology and regret " .

 = Hurricane Daisy ( 1962 ) = 
 Hurricane Daisy brought the worst flooding to New England since Hurricane Diane in 1955 . The fourth named storm and second hurricane of the 1962 Atlantic hurricane season , Daisy developed from a tropical disturbance located well east of the Leeward Islands on September 29 . Initially a tropical depression , it headed west @-@ northwestward and failed to strengthen significantly . While located a short distance from the Leeward Islands , the depression curved northwestward and began intensifying . On October 2 , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Daisy . Around that time , the storm turned back to the west @-@ northwest and continued to deepen . Daisy reached hurricane status late on October 3 . Two days later , it became a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale , but briefly weakened back to a Category 1 on October 6 . 
 Daisy re @-@ strengthened into a Category 2 later on October 6 , and peaked with winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) . The outerbands of Daisy produced strong winds and heavy surf in Bermuda , but caused no damage . It weakened back to a Category 1 again on October 7 . While passing offshore New England , the storm , combined with a nor 'easter , produced flooding and strong winds . Two fatalities were directly related to the hurricane , and 24 other people died in traffic related deaths , that were caused by slick roads from the heavy rain . Total damage in New England was estimated to be over $ 1 @.@ 1 million ( 1962 USD ) . Early on October 8 , Daisy made landfall near Yarmouth , Nova Scotia , several hours before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone . In Atlantic Canada , the storm brought rough seas , causing coastal flooding and six fatalities in Nova Scotia .

 A Television Infrared Observation Satellite ( TIROS ) revealed the presence of a tropical disturbance east of the Leeward Islands on September 28 . A reconnaissance aircraft flight into a system on the following day indicated that a tropical depression developed near 14 @.@ 5 ° N , 48 @.@ 9 ° W. The depression initially moved west @-@ northwestward and remained disorganized for several days . In the early stages of the depression , the system appeared to have been located under minor vortices in the upper atmosphere , located within a strong east – to – west oriented trough . Approaching the Lesser Antilles , the system curved northwestward between two high pressure areas on September 30 and avoided landfall in the islands . By October 2 , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Daisy . The trough dissipated on the following day , causing Daisy to resume its initial west @-@ northwest motion . The storm intensified into a Category 1 hurricane later on October 3 . Further deepening occurred , and by October 5 , Daisy became a Category 2 hurricane . 
 A nor 'easter off the East Coast of the United States caused Daisy to curve northward on October 5 . The storm briefly weakened to a Category 1 hurricane on October 6 . Six hours later , it re @-@ strengthened to a Category 2 hurricane ; Daisy also attained its minimum barometric pressure of 965 mbar ( 28 @.@ 5 inHg ) . Late on October 6 , maximum sustained winds reached 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) , the highest in relation to the system . Daisy absorbed the nor 'easter on October 6 , after it weakened . Thereafter , Daisy began accelerating and cold sea surface temperatures weakened the storm back to a Category 1 hurricane on October 7 .. It briefly curved north @-@ northwestward , before sharply turning east @-@ northeastward in the Gulf of Maine . Early on October 8 , Daisy made landfall near Yarmouth , Nova Scotia with winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . Several hours later , the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . The remnants of Daisy re @-@ emerged into the Atlantic Ocean and headed east @-@ northeastward before dissipating south of Newfoundland on October 9 .

 Damage totals from Daisy in the United States alone could surpass $ 10 million , including the passage of a nor 'easter a day prior . Two fatalities were directly related to the storm , while 24 other people died from traffic related deaths due to flooded and slick roads . Rainfall from the two systems caused record rainfall in some areas of Massachusetts , with 14 @.@ 25 inches ( 362 mm ) in Wakefield . Some areas of Boston were under 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) of water . The subways associated with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority were flooded and could not be reopened until at least a day after the rain ceased . 
 A total of 7 @.@ 71 inches ( 196 mm ) of precipitation fell in Portland , Maine within 24 hours , 3 @.@ 13 inches ( 80 mm ) of which fell in only 6 hours . Subsequently , Hurricane Daisy set a then @-@ record the highest 24 ‑ hour rainfall total for Portland ; however , this recorded was broken during Hurricane Bob in 1991 . The overall rainfall total for Portland was 9 @.@ 47 inches ( 0 @.@ 241 m ) at the international jetport . In Auburn and Lewiston , a total of 4 @.@ 58 inches ( 116 mm ) of rain fell . The Androscoggin River overflowed and flooded a road in the former . Two fatalities were reported in Maine . Throughout New England , thousands fled after homes , buildings , and school began to flood . It was considered the worst flood in the region since Hurricane Diane in 1955 , and was caused partially because falling leaves clogged drains . 
 Damages to boats were severe ; hundreds of small boats were destroyed , while many larger boats were damaged . In addition , the lobster industry suffered heavy losses from the system . In the heavy surf that caused those damages to boats , three people were rescued in two different accidents , but they sustained injuries . Also , several small structures in Mount Desert Island , Maine were swept away by the high waves . In other areas of the New England coast , tides were 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) above average ; a person was swept away and drowned , and minor tidal flooding occurred in coastal areas . In addition , a pier was washed away in the high surf . Total damage from wave and tide was $ 600 @,@ 000 . Some roads were completely under water , with pumping operations continuing for four days in the hardest hit locations . Throughout Massachusetts , many roofs were blown off of houses . 
 Strong winds were also reported in New England . The highest winds associated with Daisy were felt over coastal Maine , where winds of 70 mph ( 115 km / h ) were commonly reported . Wind damage was severe and widespread ; one person in Maine was killed when a fallen tree landed on , and crushed his car while he was in it . In the southeastern portion of the state , power outages were reported , due to fallen trees and tree limbs . In addition , some roof shingles blown off in Maine and Massachusetts , while other houses were completely unroofed . Daisy caused moderate to severe damage in eastern New England .

 = Diamond Valley Lake = 
 Diamond Valley Lake is a man @-@ made offstream reservoir located near Hemet , California , United States . It is one of the largest reservoirs in Southern California and also one of the newest . With a capacity of 800 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 990 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) , the lake nearly doubled the area ’ s surface water storage capacity and provides additional water supplies for drought , peak summer , and emergency needs . 
 The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California ( MWD ) began the $ 1 @.@ 9 billion construction project in 1995 . Filling of the lake , by way of the Colorado River Aqueduct , began in 1999 and was completed in 2003 . The lake is currently served by the Inland Feeder . 
 The lake features three earth fill dams , two located on either side of the valley and one on the north rim . Construction of the dams utilized nearby materials , and was one of the largest earthworks projects in the United States . Excavation of core materials for the dams resulted in many paleontological finds , all of which are displayed at the Western Science Center at the lake 's East end . The lake is open to boating and fishing , along with hiking and other recreational activities around the lake . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Diamond Valley Lake is located within the Domenigoni / Diamond valleys , between the Domenigoni Mountains and Rawson Mountains , 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) southwest of the city of Hemet . The site was chosen because of its location between the cities of San Diego and Los Angeles , and because of the raw materials located on @-@ site for the construction of the three dams . The location was also chosen because of its proximity , about 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) , to the existing Colorado River Aqueduct that supplies the lake with water . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Planning for the lake began in 1987 . The main goal was to meet Southern California seasonal , drought and emergency needs . MWD chose the current site because of its geographic location , and began construction planning in 1993 . Construction of the lake in 1995 with construction of the three dams . With over 40 million cubic yards of foundation excavation and 110 million cubic yards of embankment construction , the construction of the dams was the largest earthworks project in the United States . The shovels , loaders and trucks used on the project were the largest available and established a new standard for earth and rock movement . The two rock processing plants established for the project provided combined production exceeding the capability of any single commercial processing operation in California . Construction of the lake was the largest construction project by the MWD since building the Colorado River Aqueduct . 
 At its peak in 1997 and 1998 , the reservoir construction project employed an average of 1 @,@ 800 people . At times , more than 1 @,@ 900 people labored in building the reservoir ’ s three dams . From start to finish , about 5 @,@ 000 people were employed by the construction project . 
 = = = Dams = = = 
 Construction of the three dams was completed in 1999 , requiring the excavation of 31 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 41 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cu yd ) of foundation material . The earth fill dam project required about 110 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 84 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) of sand , clay and rock . Much of the materials needed were obtained from the project area . Core materials were obtained from the silty and clayey sandy alluvium in the floor of the reservoir and the rock fill came from the bedrock highlands of the reservoir 's south rim . Design and construction of the dams took into consideration the threat of earthquakes with the San Jacinto Fault Zone , located about 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from the reservoir , and the San Andreas Fault , located about 19 miles ( 31 km ) from the reservoir . 
 = = = = West Dam = = = = 
 The west dam rises to 285 feet ( 87 m ) above the valley floor . It spans 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) over a nearly flat alluvial valley floor between bedrock abutment ridges . About 65 % of the dam 's foundation area is founded on quartzite and phyllite bedrock . The remainder is founded on dense alluvium that fills three buried channels , which are up to 120 feet ( 37 m ) deep . The foundation excavations were extended 90 feet ( 27 m ) below the original ground surface to remove liquefaction soils that would have made the dam unstable in an earthquake . To minimize foundation seepage through the alluvium , 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) thick cut @-@ off walls of plastic concrete were constructed across the three alluvial channels and excavated at least 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) into bedrock . To reduce seepage through the rock foundation , the entire core width was consolidation grouted and a double @-@ line grout curtain was installed to a depth of approximately 125 feet ( 38 m ) . <unk> of the west dam took about two years to complete and required 189 miles ( 304 km ) of grout holes . 
 = = = = East Dam = = = = 
 The 2 @.@ 1 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 4 km ) long East Dam , constructed by a Kiewit @-@ led joint venture , is the longest of the three dams . It measures 1 @,@ 200 feet ( 370 m ) wide at the base and 40 feet ( 12 m ) wide at the top . Before embankment of the dam could begin , more than 18 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 14 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) of alluvium had to be excavated to reach a solid bedrock foundation . 
 The embankment required 43 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 33 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) of crushed rock . An on @-@ site crushing plant crushed and processed over 14 million tons of rock in 20 months to supply the dam 's materials . The cut @-@ off wall , which consists of a 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) thick plastic concrete mix constructed through the weathered portion of bedrock , varies in depth from 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) to 110 feet ( 34 m ) and totals 250 @,@ 000 square feet ( 23 @,@ 000 m2 ) . A two @-@ line grout curtain reaches depths of 150 feet ( 46 m ) below the foundation in the north segment of the East Dam and 100 feet ( 30 m ) in the south segment . 
 Because of the amount of material used in the construction of the east dam , some of the biggest trucks in the world were used . Twelve Caterpillar 789 dump trucks were used in construction of the East Dam .

 The Saddle Dam rises 130 feet ( 40 m ) above the lowest point in the Domenigoni Mountains ridgeline of the north rim and is around 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) long . The dam was built to increase the storage capacity of the lake , which would have been limited due to the lower ridge in this area . It is founded completely on phyllite and schist bedrock . To minimize foundation seepage , a two @-@ line grout curtain extends up to 100 feet ( 30 m ) below the foundation . 
 = = = Filling the lake = = = 
 Filling of the lake began in 1999 with water from the Colorado River Aqueduct and San Diego Canal . Water first entered the forebay , a 35 @-@ acre ( 14 ha ) — 163 @-@ million @-@ US @-@ gallon ( 620 @,@ 000 m3 ) — basin that held the water before being pumped through the pumping station . The pumping station , named after one of the founders of the MWD , Hiram W. Wadsworth , features twelve 6 @,@ 000 horsepower ( 4 @,@ 500 kW ) pumps for moving water from the forebay to the intake @-@ outlet ( I / O ) tower . In 2001 , four of the twelve pumps were converted to hydroelectric turbine generators capable of producing 3 megawatts of power each . If all the pumps were converted , the entire facility could produce up to 40 megawatts of power . 
 Water is pumped from the pumping station , located just outside the west dam , through a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 610 m ) long , 16 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) diameter pipe and into the lake via the I / O tower . At peak rate , water flowed into the lake at 1 @,@ 000 cubic feet ( 28 m3 ) per second . Filling of the lake finished in 2003 
 In 2009 , the lake began being filled with water provided by the Inland Feeder after nearly two years without a source . The water replenished much of what was lost after drought conditions required the MWD to tap into the lake . Water from the Colorado River Aqueduct is not being used due to the threat of the Quagga mussel , an invasive species that has already contaminated other Southern California lakes served by the aqueduct . 
 = = Paleontological finds = = 
 During excavation , bones and skeletons were found from extinct mastodons , mammoth , camel , sloth , dire wolf and long @-@ horned bison . Paleontologists from the San Bernardino County Museum in Redlands , California uncovered thousands of fossils in the Diamond and Domenigoni valleys that will add immensely to the store of public knowledge about the region . Collectively , these animal fossils are named the Diamond Valley Lake Local Fauna . 
 The paleontological finds of mammoth , mastodon , bison , and other Pleistocene Epoch species from Diamond Valley Lake provide a unique snapshot on inland southern California during the Ice Ages , and bridge a massive information gap between fossil deposits at La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles , California and Ice Age sites in the Mojave Desert . Unofficially , the Diamond Valley Lake area is often referred to as the " Valley of the <unk> " . Fossils from the Diamond Valley Lake site comprise a classic late Pleistocene assemblage , which includes the following extinct animals :
