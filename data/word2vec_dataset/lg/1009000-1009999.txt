 The British Aircraft Corporation TSR @-@ 2 was a cancelled Cold War strike and reconnaissance aircraft developed by the British Aircraft Corporation ( BAC ) for the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) in the late 1950s and early 1960s . The TSR @-@ 2 was designed to penetrate a well @-@ defended forward battle area at low altitudes and very high speeds , and then attack high @-@ value targets in the rear with nuclear or conventional weapons . Another intended combat role was to provide high @-@ altitude , high @-@ speed stand @-@ off , side @-@ looking , radar and photographic imagery and signals intelligence , reconnaissance . Some of the most advanced aviation technology of the period was incorporated in order to make it the highest @-@ performing aircraft in the world in its projected missions . Only one airframe flew and test flights and weight rise during design indicated that the aircraft would be unable to meet its original stringent design specifications . The design specifications had been reduced as the results of flight testing . 
 The TSR @-@ 2 was the victim of ever @-@ rising costs and inter @-@ service squabbling over Britain 's future defence needs , which led to the controversial decision to scrap the programme in 1965 . With the election of a new government , the TSR @-@ 2 was cancelled due to rising costs , in favour of purchasing an adapted version of the General Dynamics F @-@ 111 , a decision that itself was later rescinded as costs and development times increased . The replacements included the Blackburn Buccaneer and McDonnell Douglas F @-@ 4 Phantom II , both of which had previously been considered and rejected early in the TSR @-@ 2 procurement process . Eventually , the smaller swing @-@ wing Panavia Tornado was developed and adopted by a European consortium to fulfil broadly similar requirements to the TSR @-@ 2 .

 The introduction of the first practical jet engines in the late @-@ World War II period led to calls for new jet @-@ powered versions of practically every aircraft then flying . Among these was the design of a replacement for the de Havilland Mosquito , at that time among the world 's leading light bombers . The Mosquito had been designed with the express intent of lightening the aircraft in order to improve its speed as much as possible , a process that led to the removal of all defensive armament , improving performance to the point where it was unnecessary anyway . This high @-@ speed approach was extremely successful , and a jet @-@ powered version would be even more difficult to intercept . 
 The winning design , the English Electric Canberra , also dispensed with defensive armaments , producing a design with the speed that allowed it to fly past most defenses . Just as importantly , the design 's long , straight wing gave it the lift needed to operate at very high altitudes , placing it above the range where even jet powered fighters were able to operate . The Canberra could simply fly over its enemy with relative impunity , a quality that made it naturally suited to aerial reconnaissance missions , spawning a number of spin @-@ off versions of the aircraft with even larger wings for even greater altitude performance and improved range . 
 This high @-@ speed , high @-@ altitude approach was effective until the late 1950s , when the Soviet Union began to introduce its first surface @-@ to @-@ air missiles ( SAMs ) . SAMs had speed and altitude performance much greater than any contemporary aircraft . The Canberra , and other high @-@ altitude aircraft like the V bombers or United States ' B @-@ 52 Stratofortress , were extremely vulnerable to these weapons . The first aircraft to fall victim to the Soviet S @-@ 75 Dvina ( NATO name " SA @-@ 2 Guideline " ) SAM was a Taiwanese RB @-@ 57 , a US reconnaissance version of the Canberra , shot down in 1959 . 
 The solution was to fly lower ; since radar operates in line @-@ of @-@ sight , detection of an aircraft flying at low altitudes is significantly hindered , thereby reducing time for enemy counter measures . In practice , trees , hills , valleys and any other obstructions reduce this range even more , making a ground @-@ based interception extremely difficult . The Canberra was designed for medium- to high @-@ altitude flight and was not suitable for continuous terrain @-@ hugging flight ; this would require a completely different aircraft . Low @-@ level strike aircraft , or " interdictors " , grew into a new class of their own during the late 1950s . They generally featured high wing loading to reduce the effects of turbulence and cross @-@ wind , some form of high @-@ performance navigational radar to allow very low flight at high speeds , and large fuel loads to offset the higher fuel use at low altitudes . 
 = = = GOR.339 = = = 
 Aware of the changing operational environment , the Ministry of Supply started work with English Electric in 1955 , attempting to define a new light bomber to replace the Canberra . These early studies eventually settled on an aircraft with a 2 @,@ 000 nmi ( 3 @,@ 700 km ) ferry range , Mach 1 @.@ 5 speed " at altitude " and 600 nmi ( 1 @,@ 100 km ) low @-@ level range . A crew of two was required , one being the operator of the advanced navigational and attack equipment . The bombload was to be four 1 @,@ 000 lb ( 450 kg ) bombs . 
 The requirements were eventually made official in November 1956 with General Operational Requirement 339 ( GOR.339 ) , which was issued to various aircraft manufacturers in March 1957 . This requirement was exceptionally ambitious for the technology of the day , requiring a supersonic all @-@ weather aircraft that could deliver nuclear weapons over a long range , operate at high level at Mach 2 + or low level at Mach 1 @.@ 2 , with STOL or possible VTOL performance . The latter requirement was a side @-@ effect of common battle plans from the 1950s , which suggested that nuclear strikes in the opening stages of war would damage most runways and airbases , meaning that aircraft would need to take off from " rough fields " such as disused Second World War airfields , or even sufficiently flat and open areas of land . 
 Specifically , the requirement included : 
 Delivery of tactical nuclear weapons at low level in all weathers , by day and night 
 Photo @-@ reconnaissance at medium level ( day ) and low level ( day and night ) 
 Electronic reconnaissance in all weathers 
 Delivery of tactical nuclear weapons day and night at medium altitudes using blind bombing if necessary 
 Delivery of conventional bombs and rockets 
 Low level was stated to be under 1 @,@ 000 ft ( 300 m ) with an expected attack speed at sea level of Mach 0 @.@ 95 . The operational range was to be 1 @,@ 000 nmi ( 1 @,@ 900 km ) operating off runways of no more than 3 @,@ 000 ft ( 900 m ) . The TSR @-@ 2 was able to operate at 200 ft ( 61 m ) above the ground at speeds of Mach 1 @.@ 1 ; its range allowed it to operate strategically in addition to tactical scenarios . 
 = = = Political changes = = = 
 As this specification was being studied by various manufacturers , the first of the political storms that were to dog the project reared its head , when Defence Minister Duncan Sandys stated in the 1957 Defence White Paper that the era of manned combat was at an end and ballistic missiles were the weapons of the future . Within a decade , this philosophy became thoroughly discredited , but at the time , and in the climate of the Cold War and " mutual deterrence " , the missile as a weapons system appeared to make some sense , especially as it seemed missiles would offer significant cost savings over manned aircraft . This viewpoint was vigorously debated by the aviation industry and within the MOD for years . Senior RAF officers argued against the White Paper 's premise , stating the importance of mobility , and that the TSR @-@ 2 could not only replace the Canberra , but potentially the entire V bomber force . 
 In addition to the argument over the need for manned aircraft , additional political machinations had the effect of complicating the project . In September 1957 the Ministry of Supply informed the heads of the aviation companies that the only acceptable proposals would be those issued from teams consisting of more than one company . There were a large number of competing aircraft manufacturing companies in the UK while orders were decreasing , thus the government intended to foster cooperation between certain companies and encourage mergers . 
 Another political matter that did not help was the mutual distrust between the various services . At the time that GOR.339 was being defined , the Royal Navy was in the midst of its NA.39 project , which would eventually become the Blackburn Buccaneer . This was a low @-@ altitude subsonic attack aircraft , designed for over @-@ water as opposed to overland use . The savings involved in both forces using a common aircraft would be considerable , and Blackburn offered the RAF a version of the NA.39 to fit some of the GOR.339 requirements . The Chief of Defence Staff , and former First Sea Lord , Lord Mountbatten was a loyal proponent of the Buccaneer , later claiming that five of the type could be purchased for the same price as one TSR @-@ 2 . However , the RAF rebuffed the proposal , stating that it was unsuitable due to poor takeoff performance and the avionics not being capable of the desired role . As one RAF official put it , " If we show the slightest interest in NA.39 we might not get the GOR.339 aircraft . " 
 Another political opponent of the TSR @-@ 2 project was Sir Solly Zuckerman , at the time the Chief Scientific Advisor to the Ministry of Defence . Zuckerman had an extremely low opinion of British technological achievements and was much more in favour of procuring military hardware from the United States . 
 = = = Submissions = = = 
 Work on GOR.339 continued , with a deadline for submissions on 31 January 1958 . Many proposals were entered ; English Electric teamed up with Short Brothers and submitted its <unk> along with the Shorts ' <unk> , a vertical @-@ lift platform that would give the <unk> a VTOL capability ; designs were also received from Avro , Blackburn ( the NA.39 ) , de Havilland , Fairey , Hawker and Vickers @-@ Armstrongs . The Air Ministry eventually selected the EE <unk> and the Vickers @-@ Armstrongs Type 571 for further consideration . The Ministry was particularly impressed with the Vickers submission , which included not only the aircraft design , but a " total systems concept " outlining all the avionics , support facilities and logistics needed to maintain the aircraft in the field . Official opinions of English Electric 's management found it decidedly lacking in comparison to Vickers , but the combination of the two was felt by officialdom to be a useful marriage and accordingly the development contract was awarded to Vickers , with English Electric as sub @-@ contractor . 
 The existence of GOR.339 was revealed to the public in December 1958 in a statement to the House of Commons . Under pressure by the recommendations of the Committee on Estimates , the Air Ministry examined ways that the various project proposals could be combined , and in January 1959 the Minister of Supply announced that the TSR @-@ 2 would be built by Vickers @-@ Armstrongs working with English Electric ; the initials coming from " Tactical Strike and Reconnaissance , Mach 2 " , the ' Strike ' part of the designation specifically referring in RAF terminology to a nuclear weapons role . 
 On 1 January 1959 , the project was given an official go @-@ ahead ; in February , it came under the new designation Operational Requirement 343 . <unk> was more specific and built upon work from the various submissions to GOR.339 specifically stating that the low @-@ level operations would be at 200 ft ( 61 m ) or less , and that Mach 2 should be attained at altitude . 
 = = = Mission = = = 
 The envisioned " standard mission " for the TSR @-@ 2 was to carry a 2 @,@ 000 lb ( 900 kg ) weapon internally for a combat radius of 1 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 900 km ) . Of that mission 100 nautical miles ( 190 km ) was to be flown at higher altitudes at Mach 1 @.@ 7 and the 200 nmi ( 370 km ) into and out of the target area was to be flown as low as 200 ft ( 60 m ) at a speed of Mach 0 @.@ 95 . The remainder of the mission was to be flown at Mach 0 @.@ 92 . If the entire mission were to be flown at the low 200 ft ( 61 m ) altitude , the mission radius was reduced to 700 nmi ( 1 @,@ 300 km ) . Heavier weapons loads could be carried with further reductions in range . Plans for increasing the TSR @-@ 2 's range included fitting external tanks : one 450 Imperial gallon ( 2 @,@ 000 L ) tank under each wing or one 1 @,@ 000 @-@ Imperial gallon ( 4 @,@ 500 @-@ L ) tank carried centrally below the fuselage . If no internal weapons were carried , a further 570 Imperial gallons ( 2 @,@ 600 L ) could be carried in a tank in the weapons bay . Later variants would have been fitted with variable @-@ geometry wings . 
 The TSR @-@ 2 was also to be equipped with a reconnaissance pack in the weapons bay which included an optical linescan unit built by EMI , three cameras and a sideways @-@ looking radar ( SLR ) in order to carry out the majority of its reconnaissance tasks . Unlike modern linescan units that use infrared imaging , the TSR @-@ 2 's linescan would use daylight imaging or an artificial light source to illuminate the ground for night reconnaissance . 
 = = = Tactical nuclear weapons = = = 
 Carriage of the existing Red Beard tactical nuclear bomb had been specified at the beginning of the TSR @-@ 2 project , but it was quickly realised that Red Beard was unsuited to external carriage at supersonic speeds , had safety and handling limitations , and its 15 @-@ kt yield was considered inadequate for the targets assigned . Instead , in 1959 , a successor to Red Beard , an " Improved <unk> Bomb " to a specification known as Operational Requirement 1177 ( OR.1177 ) , was specified for the TSR @-@ 2 . In the tactical strike role , the TSR @-@ 2 was expected to attack targets beyond the forward edge of the battlefield assigned to the RAF by NATO , during day or night and in all weathers . These targets comprised missile sites , both hardened and soft , aircraft on airfields , runways , airfield buildings , airfield fuel installations and bomb stores , tank concentrations , ammunition and supply dumps , railways and railway tunnels , and bridges . OR.1177 specified 50 , 100 , 200 and 300 @-@ kt yields , assuming a circular error probable of 1 @,@ 200 ft ( 370 m ) and a damage probability of 0 @.@ 8 , and <unk> delivery capability , with burst heights for targets from 0 to 10 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) above sea level . Other requirements were a weight of up to 1 @,@ 000 lb ( 450 kg ) , a length of up to 144 in ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) , and a diameter up to 28 in ( 710 mm ) ( the same as Red Beard ) . 
 However , a ministerial ruling on 9 July 1962 decreed that all future tactical nuclear weapons should be limited to a yield of 10 kt . The RAF issued a new version of the OR.1177 specification , accepting the lower yield , while making provision in the design for it to be capable of adaptation later for a higher yield , in the event of the political restriction being lifted . Meanwhile , the RAF explored ways of compensating for the lower yield by including , in the specifications for both the bomb and TSR @-@ 2 , provision for releasing the smaller weapons in salvos , dropping sticks of four of the revised OR.1177 , later named WE.177A , at 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) intervals to prevent the detonation of the first weapon destroying the succeeding ones before they could , in turn , detonate . This led to the requirement that the TSR @-@ 2 must be able to carry four <unk> , two internally and two on external underwing stores pylons — the width of the TSR @-@ 2 bomb bay ( originally designed to accommodate a single Red Beard weapon ) necessitating the reduction in diameter of the WE.177A to 16 @.@ 5 in , the bomb 's width and fin span being constrained by the need to fit two WE.177 bombs side @-@ by @-@ side in the aircraft 's bomb bay . The requirement for stick bombing using nuclear weapons was soon dropped as larger yield bombs came back into favour . 
 A drawback of carrying WE.177 on external pylons was a limitation due to aerodynamic heating of the bomb 's casing . WE.177A was limited to a maximum carriage time of five minutes at Mach 1 @.@ 15 at low level on TSR @-@ 2 , otherwise the bomb 's temperature would rise above its permitted maximum . This would impose a severe operational restriction on TSR @-@ 2 , as the aircraft was designed for M = 1 + cruise at this height . 
 Nuclear stand @-@ off missiles were also proposed for the TSR @-@ 2 early in development but not proceeded with . These included an air @-@ launched development of the Blue Water missile , carried underwing , or semi @-@ recessed in the bomb bay , and an air @-@ launched ballistic missile , referred to as Grand Slam , with a warhead derived from that intended for the Skybolt missile , and a range of 100 nautical miles ( 190 km ) . Conventional missiles were catered for instead , with the design originally centring on use of the AGM @-@ 12 Bullpup , then moving on to favour the French AS @-@ 30 before settling on the new <unk> missile ( which would become the AJ @-@ 168 Martel ) . 
 After the cancellation of the TSR @-@ 2 , the RAF eventually filled the tactical strike requirement using McDonnell F @-@ 4 Phantom IIs with US dual @-@ key nuclear weapons , but continued their attempts to get the 10 @-@ kt limit lifted . Development of WE.177A was delayed by several years due to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment ( AWRE ) at Aldermaston being inundated with work on other warhead developments . AWRE workload eased after completion of the Polaris missile warheads and work was able to resume on the WE.177A , deliveries to the RAF beginning in late 1971 for deployment on Buccaneers of RAF Germany , a year after WE.177A deliveries to the Royal Navy . Approval for high @-@ yield tactical weapons was eventually gained in 1970 and , by 1975 , the RAF had <unk> , which at almost 200 kt was a weapon very similar to what they had planned for the TSR @-@ 2 in 1959 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Throughout 1959 , English Electric ( EE ) and Vickers worked on combining the best of both designs in order to put forward a joint design with a view to having an aircraft flying by 1963 , while also working on merging the companies under the umbrella of the British Aircraft Corporation ( along with Bristol Aircraft ) . EE had put forward a delta winged design and Vickers , a swept wing on a long fuselage . The EE wing , born of their greater supersonic experience , was judged superior to Vickers , while the Vickers fuselage was preferred . In effect , the aircraft would be built 50 / 50 : Vickers the front half , EE the rear . 
 The TSR @-@ 2 was to be powered by two Bristol @-@ Siddeley Olympus reheated turbojets , advanced variants of those used in the Avro Vulcan . The Olympus would be further developed and would power the supersonic Concorde . The design featured a small shoulder @-@ mounted delta wing with down @-@ turned tips , an all @-@ moving swept tailplane and a large all @-@ moving fin . Blown flaps were fitted across the entire trailing edge of the wing to achieve the short takeoff and landing requirement , something that later designs would achieve with the technically more complex swing @-@ wing approach . No ailerons were fitted , control in roll instead being implemented by differential movement of the slab tailplanes . The wing loading was high for its time , enabling the aircraft to fly at very high speed and low level with great stability without being constantly upset by thermals and other ground @-@ related weather phenomena . The EE Chief Test Pilot , Wing Commander Roland Beamont , favourably compared the TSR @-@ 2 's supersonic flying characteristics to the Canberra 's own subsonic flight characteristics , stating that the Canberra was more troublesome . 
 According to the Flight Envelope diagram , <unk> was capable of sustained cruise at Mach 2 @.@ 05 at altitudes between 37 @,@ 000 ft ( 11 @,@ 000 m ) and 51 @,@ 000 ft ( 16 @,@ 000 m ) and had a dash speed of Mach 2 @.@ 35 ( with a limiting leading edge temperature of 140 degrees Celsius ) . Its theoretical maximum speed was Mach 3 in level flight at 45 @,@ 000 ft ( 14 @,@ 000 m ) . 
 The aircraft featured some extremely sophisticated avionics for navigation and mission delivery , which would also prove to be one of the reasons for the spiralling costs of the project . Some features , such as forward looking radar ( FLR ) , side @-@ looking radar for navigational fixing , only became commonplace on military aircraft years later . These features allowed for an innovative autopilot system which , in turn , enabled long distance terrain @-@ following sorties as crew workload and pilot input had been greatly reduced . 
 There were considerable problems with realising the design . Some contributing manufacturers were employed directly by the Ministry rather than through BAC , leading to communication difficulties and further cost overruns . Equipment , an area in which BAC had autonomy , would be supplied by the Ministry from " associate contractors " , although the equipment would be designed and provided by BAC , subject to ministry approval . The overall outlay of funds made it the largest aircraft project in Britain to date . 
 Unlike most previous projects , there were to be no prototypes . Under the " development batch " procedure pioneered by the Americans ( and also used by English Electric for the Lightning ) , there would instead be a development batch of nine airframes , to be built using production jigs . The choice of proceeding to production tooling turned out to be another source of delay , with the first aircraft having to adhere to strict production standards or deal with the bureaucracy of attaining concessions to allow them to exhibit differences from later airframes . Four years into the project , the first few airframes had effectively become prototypes in all but name , exhibiting a succession of omissions from the specification and differences from the intended pre @-@ production and production batches .

 = = = Testing = = = 
 Despite the increasing costs ( which were inevitable , given the low original estimates ) , the first two of the development batch aircraft were completed . Engine development and undercarriage problems led to delays for the first flight which meant that the TSR @-@ 2 missed the opportunity to be displayed to the public at that year 's Farnborough Airshow . In the days leading up to the testing , Denis Healey , the Opposition defence spokesman , had criticised the aircraft saying that by the time it was introduced it would face " new anti @-@ aircraft " missiles that would shoot it down making it prohibitively expensive at £ 16 million per aircraft ( on the basis of only 30 ordered ) . 
 Test pilot Roland Beamont finally made the first flight from the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment ( A & AEE ) at Boscombe Down , Wiltshire , on 27 September 1964 . Initial flight tests were all performed with the undercarriage down and engine power strictly controlled — with limits of 250 kn ( 460 km / h ) and 10 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) on the first ( 15 @-@ minute ) flight . Shortly after takeoff on XR219 's second flight , vibration from a fuel pump at the resonant frequency of the human eyeball caused the pilot to throttle back one engine to avoid momentary loss of vision . 
 Only on the 10th test flight was the landing gear successfully retracted — problems preventing this on previous occasions , but serious vibration problems on landing persisted throughout the flight testing programme . The first supersonic test flight ( Flight 14 ) was achieved on the transfer from A & AEE , Boscombe Down , to BAC Warton . During the flight , the aircraft achieved Mach 1 on dry power only ( supercruise ) . Following this , Beamont lit a single reheat unit only ( because of problems with the other engine 's reheat fuel pump ) , with the result that the aircraft accelerated away from the chase Lightning flown by Wing Commander James " Jimmy " Dell , who had to catch up using reheat on both engines . On flying the TSR @-@ 2 himself , Dell described the prototype as handling " like a big Lightning " . 
 Over a period of six months , a total of 24 test flights were conducted . Most of the complex electronics were not fitted to the first aircraft , so these flights were all concerned with the basic flying qualities of the aircraft which , according to the test pilots involved , were outstanding . Speeds of Mach 1 @.@ 12 and sustained low @-@ level flights down to 200 ft ( above the Pennines ) were achieved . <unk> vibration problems continued , however , and only in the final few flights , when XR219 was fitted with additional tie @-@ struts on the already complex landing gear , was there a significant reduction in them . The last test flight took place on 31 March 1965 . 
 Although the test flying programme was not completed and the TSR @-@ 2 was undergoing typical design and systems modifications reflective of its sophisticated configuration , " [ T ] here was no doubt that the airframe would be capable of accomplishing the tasks set for it and that it represented a major advance on any other type . " 
 Costs continued to rise , which led to concerns at both company and government upper management levels , and the aircraft was also falling short of many of the requirements laid out in <unk> , such as takeoff distance and combat radius . As a cost @-@ saving measure , a reduced specification was agreed upon , notably reductions in combat radius to 650 nmi ( 1 @,@ 200 km ) , the top speed to Mach 1 @.@ 75 and takeoff run up increased from 600 to 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 550 to 910 m ) .

 By the 1960s , the United States military was developing the swing @-@ wing F @-@ 111 project as a follow @-@ on to the Republic F @-@ 105 Thunderchief , a fast low @-@ level fighter @-@ bomber designed in the 1950s with an internal bay for a nuclear weapon . There had been some interest in the TSR @-@ 2 from Australia for the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) , but in 1963 , the RAAF chose to buy the F @-@ 111 instead , having been offered a better price and delivery schedule by the American manufacturer . Nonetheless , the RAAF had to wait 10 years before the F @-@ 111 was ready to enter service , by which time the anticipated programme cost had tripled . The RAF was also asked to consider the F @-@ 111 as an alternative cost @-@ saving measure . In response to suggestions of cancellation , BAC employees held a protest march , and the new Labour government , which had come to power in 1964 , issued strong denials . 
 However , at two Cabinet meetings held on 1 April 1965 , it was decided to cancel the TSR @-@ 2 on the grounds of projected cost , and instead to obtain an option agreement to acquire up to 110 F @-@ 111 aircraft with no immediate commitment to buy . This decision was announced in the budget speech of 6 April 1965 . The maiden flight of the second development batch aircraft , XR220 , was due on the day of the announcement , but following an accident in conveying the airframe to Boscombe Down , coupled with the announcement of the project cancellation , it never happened . Ultimately , only the first prototype , XR219 , ever took to the air . A week later , the Chancellor defended the decision in a debate in the House of Commons , saying that the F @-@ 111 would prove cheaper . 
 Aeronautical engineer Sir Sydney Camm ( designer of the Hawker Hurricane ) said of the TSR @-@ 2 : " All modern aircraft have four dimensions : span , length , height and politics . TSR @-@ 2 simply got the first three right . " 
 = = = TSR @-@ 2 replacements = = = 
 To replace the TSR @-@ 2 , the Air Ministry initially placed an option for the F @-@ 111K ( a modified F @-@ 111A with F @-@ 111C enhancements ) but also considered two other choices : a Rolls @-@ Royce Spey ( <unk> Spey 25R ) conversion of a Dassault Mirage IV ( the Dassault / BAC Spey @-@ Mirage IV ) and an enhanced Blackburn Buccaneer <unk> with a new nav @-@ attack system and reconnaissance capability , referred to as the " Buccaneer 2 @-@ Double @-@ Star " . Neither proposal was pursued as a TSR @-@ 2 replacement although a final decision was reserved until the 1966 Defence Review . Defence Minister Healey 's memo about the F @-@ 111 and the Cabinet minutes regarding the final cancellation of the TSR @-@ 2 indicate that the F @-@ 111 was preferred . 
 Following the 1966 Defence White Paper , the Air Ministry decided on two aircraft : the F @-@ 111K , with a longer @-@ term replacement being a joint Anglo @-@ French project for a variable geometry strike aircraft - the Anglo French Variable Geometry Aircraft ( AFVG ) . A censure debate followed on 1 May 1967 , in which Healey claimed the cost of the TSR @-@ 2 would have been £ 1 @,@ 700 million over 15 years including running costs , compared with £ 1 @,@ 000 million for the F @-@ 111K / AFVG combination . Although 10 F @-@ 111Ks were ordered in April 1966 with an additional order for 40 in April 1967 , the F @-@ 111 programme suffered enormous cost escalation coupled with the devaluation of the pound , far exceeding that of the TSR @-@ 2 projection . Many technical problems were still unresolved before successful operational deployment and , faced with poorer @-@ than @-@ projected performance estimates , the order for 50 F @-@ 111Ks for the RAF was eventually cancelled in January 1968 . 
 To provide a suitable alternative to the TSR @-@ 2 , the RAF settled on a combination of the F @-@ 4 Phantom II and the Blackburn Buccaneer , some of which were transferred from the Royal Navy . These were the very same aircraft that the RAF had derided in order to get the TSR @-@ 2 go @-@ ahead , but the Buccaneer proved capable and remained in service until 1994 . The RN and RAF versions of the Phantom II were given the designation F @-@ 4K and F @-@ 4M respectively , and entered service as the Phantom FG.1 ( fighter / ground attack ) and Phantom FGR.2 ( fighter / ground attack / reconnaissance ) , remaining in service ( in the air @-@ to @-@ air role ) until 1992 . 
 The RAF 's Phantoms were replaced in the strike / reconnaissance role by the SEPECAT Jaguar in the mid @-@ 1970s . In the 1980s , both the Jaguar and Buccaneer were eventually replaced in this role by the variable @-@ geometry Panavia Tornado , a much smaller design than either the F @-@ 111 or the TSR @-@ 2 . Experience in the design and development of the avionics , particularly the terrain @-@ following capabilities , were used on the later Tornado programme . In the late 1970s , as the Tornado was nearing full production , an aviation businessman , Christopher de Vere , initiated a highly speculative feasibility study into resurrecting and updating the TSR @-@ 2 project . However , despite persistent lobbying of the UK government of the time , his proposal was not taken seriously and came to nothing . 
 = = Survivors = = 
 The TSR @-@ 2 tooling , jigs and many of the part completed aircraft were all scrapped at Brooklands within six months of the cancellation . Two airframes eventually survived : the complete XR220 at the RAF Museum , Cosford near Wolverhampton , and the much less complete <unk> at the Imperial War Museum Duxford . The only airframe ever to fly , XR219 , along with the completed <unk> and part completed <unk> were taken to Shoeburyness and used as targets to test the vulnerability of a modern airframe and systems to gunfire and shrapnel . Four additional completed airframes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and one incomplete airframe <unk> ( X @-@ 06 @,@ 07 @,@ 08 and 09 ) were scrapped by R J Coley and Son , Hounslow Middlesex . Four further airframe serials <unk> to <unk> were allocated but these aircraft were allegedly not built . Construction of a further 10 aircraft ( X @-@ 10 to 19 ) allocated serials <unk> to 669 was started but all partly built airframes were again scrapped by R J Coley . The last serial of that batch , <unk> is listed as " cancelled " , as are those of another batch of 50 projected aircraft , <unk> to 995 . By coincidence - the projected batch of 46 General Dynamics F @-@ 111Ks ( of which the first four were the trainer variant TF @-@ 111K ) were allocated RAF serials <unk> @-@ 887 and 902 @-@ 947 , but these again were cancelled when the first two were still incomplete . 
 The apparent haste with which the project was scrapped has been the source of much argument and bitterness since . The TSR @-@ 2 , nonetheless , remains a lingering " what if ? " of British aviation , comparable with the cancellation and destruction of the American Northrop Flying Wing bombers , and the Avro Canada CF @-@ 105 Arrow interceptor that was scrapped in Canada in 1959 .

 = Leverett George DeVeber = 
 Leverett George DeVeber ( sometimes spelled De <unk> ) ( February 10 , 1849 – July 9 , 1925 ) was a Canadian politician who served as Member of the Legislative Assemblies of Alberta and the North @-@ West Territories , minister in the government of Alberta , and member of the Senate of Canada . Born in New Brunswick and trained as a physician , he joined the North @-@ West Mounted Police and came west , eventually settling in Lethbridge after leaving the police force . He represented Lethbridge in the North @-@ West Legislative Assembly from 1898 until 1905 , when Lethbridge became part of the new province of Alberta . He was appointed Minister without Portfolio in Alberta 's first government , but resigned four months later to accept an appointment to the Senate , where he remained until his death . 
 = = Early life = = 
 DeVeber was born February 10 , 1849 , in Saint John , New Brunswick . His great @-@ grandfather , Gabriel DeVeber , had been a British army officer who was rewarded for his service in the American Revolution with land in New Brunswick , where his descendants had lived since . Leverett George DeVeber was educated in Saint John and Kingston before attending King 's College in Windsor , Nova Scotia . He was a prominent rower in New Brunswick , and also played cricket and baseball and took part in shooting , hunting , and fishing events . 
 He studied for a year at Harvard College and then completed his medical studies at St. Bartholomew 's Hospital in London , from which he graduated in 1870 . He then studied at the University of Pennsylvania for a year . He practiced medicine in Saint John for six years , before coming west to join the North @-@ West Mounted Police as a surgeon in 1882 . Over the next three years he was stationed at Fort Walsh , Calgary , and Fort MacLeod ; it was in this last town that he left the NWMP to set up a civilian practice in 1885 . 
 In 1885 DeVeber married Rachael Ann Ryan , who was born in Melbourne where her father was posted with the British Army . The pair would have two children : Marion Frances DeVeber , who married shipbuilder Francis Dunn and moved to England , and Leverett Sandys DeVeber , who worked in Toronto for the Bank of Montreal . 
 DeVeber moved to Lethbridge in 1890 , and became its Medical Officer of Health in 1893 , in which capacity he continued until at least 1924 . In Lethbridge he was involved in music : he took charge of his church 's choir in 1891 , and the same year sang at a local concert after the intended headliner , Nora Clench , failed to show up . He was also active with the Episcopalian church and the Canadian Order of Foresters .

 = = = Territorial and provincial service = = = 
 DeVeber was acclaimed to the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories in the 1898 election , and re @-@ elected in the 1902 election . Though he was a Liberal , he wholeheartedly supported the efforts of Premier Frederick W. A. G. Haultain to conduct territory politics along non @-@ partisan lines . As the federal government prepared to create two new provinces , Alberta and Saskatchewan , out of the Northwest <unk> , DeVeber joined with Haultain in advocating the continuation of this non @-@ partisan approach into the governments of the new provinces . This position put him at odds with the Liberal federal government , led by Wilfrid Laurier , who wanted the new provinces ' governments to be Liberal . A Liberal , George Bulyea , was therefore appointed Lieutenant Governor of Alberta , and it was understood that he would appoint a Liberal as the province 's first premier . 
 After Alberta 's two most prominent Liberals , Peter Talbot and Frank Oliver , made it clear that they were not interested , DeVeber considered himself as a possible candidate . Less than two months before Alberta 's formal creation , he wrote to his colleague in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories , Alexander Cameron Rutherford , that the possibilities " practically came to you and I , both of us weak enough God knows but we have the sense to see it . " DeVeber 's belief that he may be appointed premier does not appear to have been well @-@ founded : his opposition to the introduction of party lines earned him the enmity of some Liberals , not least because it aligned him with Haultain , a Conservative . In the estimation of historian L. G. Thomas , DeVeber 's fellow Liberals " were not inclined to take him too seriously " as a potential premier . 
 Once it became clear that he was not to become premier , DeVeber turned his ambitions towards the Canadian Senate . Though he had little interest in sustained involvement with the government of Alberta , he accepted Rutherford 's ( for Rutherford had been named premier ) invitation to serve in his first cabinet as Minister without Portfolio . He made clear that he viewed the appointment as an interim one , to give Rutherford time to evaluate the many novice politicians entering the new province 's legislature and , in DeVeber 's words , " ascertain who of the new blood will rise to the surface " . In keeping with the expectations of a government minister in the Westminster system , DeVeber ran in the 1905 provincial election , defeating Conservative William Carlos Ives by a comfortable margin in the Lethbridge electoral district . 
 = = = Senator = = = 
 DeVeber did not serve long either as minister or Member of the Legislative Assembly : having received word that he was to be appointed to the Senate , he resigned from cabinet on March 1 , 1906 — exactly four months after his appointment — and from the legislature March 7 . He formally began his term as Senator the next day . His time as an MLA was so short he did not sign the rolls in the Alberta Legislature and was never sworn in . 
 While in the Senate , DeVeber chaired the Standing Committee on Public Health and Inspection of Foods . One issue examined by this committee was water pollution : beginning in March 1909 and for nearly a year afterwards , it studied the question in view of the increasing mortality from typhoid fever , and concluded , in the words of the University of Michigan 's Jennifer Read , " that the country required some form of legislation to manage the problem . However , it was at a loss about the form it should take and from what body it should emanate . " As chair of the committee , DeVeber attended an October 1910 federal @-@ provincial conference in Ottawa called to attempt to coordinate all Canadian jurisdictions ' responses to water pollution . Besides recommending that provincial governments use their constitutional authority over health and municipal government to prevent undue water pollution from municipal sewage systems , it advised the federal government to use its authority over navigable waterways to prohibit the dumping of most waste into them ; DeVeber supplied a draft bill for Parliament 's consideration . 
 At the same time , DeVeber 's colleague Napoléon Belcourt was championing a similar measure in the Senate ( as an Ottawa resident , Belcourt was disturbed by the effect on the city 's water supply by the dumping of waste upstream , in Aylmer , Quebec ) , and while doing so he quoted extensively from the report of DeVeber 's committee . When Belcourt 's bill came up for debate , DeVeber scolded him on the floor of the Senate for misrepresenting the committee 's report as being much more supportive of the bill than it actually was ; in the estimation of University of Ottawa law professor Jamie Benidickson , DeVeber 's comments assured the bill 's defeat . 
 DeVeber remained a Senator until his death in 1925 . Alberta 's Mount DeVeber , located in Willmore Wilderness Park , is named in his honour .

 = Gustav Mahler = 
 Gustav Mahler ( 7 July 1860 , <unk> in Bohemia , now Czech Republic – 18 May 1911 , Vienna in Austria ) was an Austrian late @-@ Romantic composer , and one of the leading conductors of his generation . As a composer he acted as a bridge between the 19th century Austro @-@ German tradition and the modernism of the early 20th century . While in his lifetime his status as a conductor was established beyond question , his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative neglect which included a ban on its performance in much of Europe during the Nazi era . After 1945 his compositions were rediscovered and championed by a new generation of listeners ; Mahler then became one of the most frequently performed and recorded of all composers , a position he has sustained into the 21st century . 
 Born in Bohemia ( then part of Austrian Empire ) as a German @-@ speaking Jew of humble circumstances , Mahler displayed his musical gifts at an early age . After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878 , he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe , culminating in his appointment in 1897 as director of the Vienna Court Opera ( Hofoper ) . During his ten years in Vienna , Mahler — who had converted to Catholicism to secure the post — experienced regular opposition and hostility from the anti @-@ Semitic press . Nevertheless , his innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his reputation as one of the greatest of opera conductors , particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner , Mozart , and Tchaikovsky . Late in his life he was briefly director of New York 's Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic . 
 Mahler 's œuvre is relatively small ; for much of his life composing was necessarily a part @-@ time activity while he earned his living as a conductor . Aside from early works such as a movement from a piano quartet composed when he was a student in Vienna , Mahler 's works are generally designed for large orchestral forces , symphonic choruses and operatic soloists . These works were frequently controversial when first performed , and several were slow to receive critical and popular approval ; exceptions included his Symphony No. 2 and the triumphant premiere of his Eighth Symphony in 1910 . Some of Mahler 's immediate musical successors included the composers of the Second Viennese School , notably Arnold Schoenberg , Alban Berg and Anton Webern . Dmitri Shostakovich and Benjamin Britten are among later 20th @-@ century composers who admired and were influenced by Mahler . The International Gustav Mahler Institute was established in 1955 to honour the composer 's life and work . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 = = = = Family background = = = = 
 The Mahler family came from eastern Bohemia and were of humble circumstances ; the composer 's grandmother had been a street pedlar . Bohemia was then part of the Austrian Empire ; the Mahler family belonged to a German @-@ speaking minority among Bohemians , and was also Jewish . From this background the future composer developed early on a permanent sense of exile , " always an intruder , never welcomed " . 
 Bernhard Mahler , the pedlar 's son and the composer 's father , elevated himself to the ranks of the petite bourgeoisie by becoming a coachman and later an innkeeper . He bought a modest house in the village of <unk> ( <unk> ) , halfway between Prague in Bohemia and Brno in Moravia , in the geographic center of today 's Czech Republic . Bernhard 's wife Marie gave birth to the first of the couple 's 14 children , a son Isidor , who died in infancy . Two years later , on 7 July 1860 , their second son , Gustav , was born . 
 = = = = Childhood = = = = 
 In December 1860 , Bernhard Mahler moved with his wife and infant son , Gustav , to the town of Iglau ( Jihlava ) , 25 km ( 16 mi ) to the south @-@ east , where he built up a distillery and tavern business . The family grew rapidly , but of the 12 children born to the family in Iglau only six survived infancy . Iglau was then a thriving commercial town of 20 @,@ 000 people where Gustav was introduced to music through street songs , dance tunes , folk melodies , and the trumpet calls and marches of the local military band . All of these elements would later contribute to his mature musical vocabulary . 
 When he was four years old , Gustav discovered his grandparents ' piano and took to it immediately . He developed his performing skills sufficiently to be considered a local Wunderkind and gave his first public performance at the town theatre when he was ten years old . Although Gustav loved making music , his school reports from the Iglau Gymnasium portrayed him as absent @-@ minded and unreliable in academic work . In 1871 , in the hope of improving the boy 's results , his father sent him to the New Town Gymnasium in Prague , but Gustav was unhappy there and soon returned to Iglau . In 1874 he suffered a bitter personal loss when his younger brother Ernst died after a long illness . Mahler sought to express his feelings in music : with the help of a friend , Josef Steiner , he began work on an opera , Herzog Ernst von Schwaben ( " Duke Ernest of Swabia " ) as a memorial to his lost brother . Neither the music nor the libretto of this work has survived . 
 = = = = Student days = = = = 
 Bernhard Mahler supported his son 's ambitions for a music career , and agreed that the boy should try for a place at the Vienna Conservatory . The young Mahler was auditioned by the renowned pianist Julius Epstein , and accepted for 1875 – 76 . He made good progress in his piano studies with Epstein and won prizes at the end of each of his first two years . For his final year , 1877 – 78 , he concentrated on composition and harmony under Robert Fuchs and Franz Krenn . Few of Mahler 's student compositions have survived ; most were abandoned when he became dissatisfied with them . He destroyed a symphonic movement prepared for an end @-@ of @-@ term competition , after its scornful rejection by the autocratic director Joseph Hellmesberger on the grounds of copying errors . Mahler may have gained his first conducting experience with the Conservatory 's student orchestra , in rehearsals and performances , although it appears that his main role in this orchestra was as a percussionist . 
 Among Mahler 's fellow students at the Conservatory was the future song composer Hugo Wolf , with whom he formed a close friendship . Wolf was unable to submit to the strict disciplines of the Conservatory and was expelled . Mahler , while sometimes rebellious , avoided the same fate only by writing a penitent letter to Hellmesberger . He attended occasional lectures by Anton Bruckner and , though never formally his pupil , was influenced by him . On 16 December 1877 , he attended the disastrous premiere of Bruckner 's Third Symphony , at which the composer was shouted down , and most of the audience walked out . Mahler and other sympathetic students later prepared a piano version of the symphony , which they presented to Bruckner . Along with many music students of his generation , Mahler fell under the spell of Richard Wagner , though his chief interest was the sound of the music rather than the staging . It is not known whether he saw any of Wagner 's operas during his student years . 
 Mahler left the Conservatory in 1878 with a diploma but without the prestigious silver medal given for outstanding achievement . He then enrolled at the University of Vienna ( he had , at Bernhard 's insistence , sat and with difficulty passed the " matura " , or entrance examination ) and followed courses which reflected his developing interests in literature and philosophy . After leaving the University in 1879 , Mahler made some money as a piano teacher , continued to compose , and in 1880 finished a dramatic cantata , Das klagende Lied ( " The Song of Lamentation " ) . This , his first substantial composition , shows traces of Wagnerian and Brucknerian influences , yet includes many musical elements which musicologist Deryck Cooke describes as " pure Mahler " . Its first performance was delayed until 1901 , when it was presented in a revised , shortened form . 
 Mahler developed interests in German philosophy , and was introduced by his friend Siegfried <unk> to the works of Arthur Schopenhauer , Friedrich Nietzsche , Gustav Fechner and Hermann <unk> . These thinkers continued to influence Mahler and his music long after his student days were over . Mahler 's biographer Jonathan Carr says that the composer 's head was " not only full of the sound of Bohemian bands , trumpet calls and marches , Bruckner chorales and Schubert sonatas . It was also throbbing with the problems of philosophy and metaphysics he had thrashed out , above all , with <unk> . "

 = = = = First appointments = = = = 
 In the summer of 1880 , Mahler took his first professional conducting job , in a small wooden theatre in the spa town of Bad Hall , south of Linz . The repertory was exclusively operetta ; it was , in Carr 's words " a dismal little job " , which Mahler accepted only after Julius Epstein told him he would soon work his way up . In 1881 , he was engaged at the <unk> in Laibach ( now Ljubljana , in Slovenia ) , where the small but resourceful company was prepared to attempt more ambitious works . Here , Mahler conducted his first full @-@ scale opera , Verdi 's Il trovatore , one of more than 50 that he presented during his time in Laibach . After completing his six @-@ month engagement , Mahler returned to Vienna and worked part @-@ time as chorus @-@ master at the Vienna Carltheater . 
 In January 1883 , Mahler became conductor at a run @-@ down theatre in Olmütz ( now Olomouc ) . He later wrote : " From the moment I crossed the threshold of the Olmütz theatre I felt like one awaiting the wrath of God . " Despite poor relations with the orchestra , Mahler brought five new operas to the theatre , including Bizet 's Carmen , and won over the press that had initially been hostile to him . After a week 's trial at the Royal Theatre in the Hessian town of Kassel , Mahler became the theatre 's " Musical and Choral Director " from August 1883 . The title concealed the reality that Mahler was subordinate to the theatre 's Kapellmeister , Wilhelm <unk> , who disliked him and set out to make his life miserable . Despite the unpleasant atmosphere , Mahler had moments of success at Kassel . He directed a performance of his favourite opera , Weber 's Der Freischütz , and , on 23 June 1884 , conducted his own incidental music to Joseph Victor von <unk> 's play Der <unk> von Säckingen ( " The Trumpeter of Säckingen " ) , the first professional public performance of a Mahler work . An ardent , but ultimately unfulfilled , love affair with soprano Johanna Richter led Mahler to write a series of love poems which became the text of his song cycle Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen ( " Songs of a Wayfarer " ) . 
 In January 1884 , the distinguished conductor Hans von Bülow brought the Meiningen Court Orchestra to Kassel and gave two concerts . Hoping to escape from his job in the theatre , Mahler unsuccessfully sought a post as Bülow 's permanent assistant . However , in the following year his efforts to find new employment resulted in a six @-@ year contract with the prestigious Leipzig Opera , to begin in 1886 . Unwilling to remain in Kassel for another year , Mahler resigned in July 1885 , and through good fortune was offered a standby appointment as an assistant conductor at the Neues Deutsches Theater ( New German Theatre ) in Prague . 
 = = = = Prague and Leipzig = = = = 
 In Prague , the emergence of Czech National Revival had increased the popularity and importance of the new Czech National Theatre , and had led to a downturn in the Neues Deutsches Theater 's fortunes . Mahler 's task was to help arrest this decline by offering high @-@ quality productions of German opera . He enjoyed early success presenting works by Mozart and Wagner , composers with whom he would be particularly associated for the rest of his career , but his individualistic and increasingly autocratic conducting style led to friction , and a falling out with his more experienced fellow @-@ conductor , Ludwig <unk> . In April 1886 , Mahler left Prague to take up his post at the Neues Stadttheater in Leipzig , where rivalry with his senior colleague Arthur Nikisch began at once . This was primarily over how the two should share conducting duties for the theatre 's new production of Wagner 's Ring cycle . Nikisch 's illness , in January 1887 , meant that Mahler took charge of the whole cycle , and scored a resounding public success . This did not , however , win him popularity with the orchestra , who resented his dictatorial manner and heavy rehearsal schedules . 
 In Leipzig , Mahler befriended Carl von Weber , grandson of the composer , and agreed to prepare a performing version of Carl Maria von Weber 's unfinished opera Die drei Pintos ( " The Three Pintos " ) . Mahler transcribed and orchestrated the existing musical sketches , used parts of other Weber works , and added some composition of his own . The premiere at the Stadttheater , in January 1888 , was an important occasion at which Tchaikovsky was present , as were the heads of various opera houses . The work was well @-@ received ; its success did much to raise Mahler 's public profile , and brought him financial rewards . His involvement with the Weber family was complicated by a romantic attachment to Carl von Weber 's wife Marion which , though intense on both sides , ultimately came to nothing . At around this time Mahler discovered the German folk @-@ poem collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn ( " The Youth 's Magic Horn " ) , which would dominate much of his compositional output for the following 12 years . 
 In May 1888 , Mahler 's new @-@ found financial security enabled him to resign his Leipzig position after a dispute with the Stadttheater 's chief stage manager . Without a post , Mahler returned to Prague to work on a revival of Die drei Pintos and a production of Peter Cornelius 's Der Barbier von Bagdad . This short stay ended unhappily , with Mahler 's dismissal following an outburst during rehearsals . However , through the efforts of an old Viennese friend , Guido Adler , Mahler 's name went forward as a potential director of the Royal Hungarian Opera in Budapest . He was interviewed , made a good impression , and was offered the post from October 1888 . 
 = = = = Apprentice composer = = = = 
 In the early years of Mahler 's conducting career , composing was a spare time activity . Between his Laibach and Olmütz appointments he worked on settings of verses by Richard Leander and Tirso de Molina , later collected as Volume I of Lieder und Gesänge ( " Songs and Airs " ) . Mahler 's first orchestral song cycle , Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen , composed at Kassel , was based on his own verses , although the first poem , " Wenn mein Schatz Hochzeit macht " ( " When my love becomes a bride " ) closely follows the text of a Wunderhorn poem . The melodies for the second and fourth songs of the cycle were incorporated into the First Symphony , which Mahler finished in 1888 , at the height of his relationship with Marion von Weber . The intensity of Mahler 's feelings are reflected in the music , which originally was written as a five @-@ movement symphonic poem with a descriptive programme . One of these movements , the " <unk> " , later discarded , was based on a passage from his earlier work Der <unk> von Säckingen . After completing the symphony , Mahler composed a 20 @-@ minute funeral march , or <unk> , which later became the first movement of his Second Symphony . 
 There has been frequent speculation about lost or destroyed works from Mahler 's early years . The Dutch conductor Willem Mengelberg believed that the First Symphony was too mature to be a first symphonic work , and must have had predecessors . In 1938 , Mengelberg revealed the existence of the so @-@ called " Dresden archive " , a series of manuscripts in the possession of the widowed Marion von Weber . According to the Mahler historian Donald Mitchell , it was highly likely that important Mahler manuscripts of early symphonic works had been held in Dresden ; this archive , if it existed , was almost certainly destroyed in the bombing of Dresden in 1945 ;

 On arriving in Budapest in October 1888 , Mahler encountered a cultural conflict between conservative Hungarian nationalists who favoured a policy of Magyarisation , and progressives who wanted to maintain and develop the country 's Austro @-@ German cultural traditions . In the opera house a dominant conservative caucus , led by the music director Sándor Erkel , had maintained a limited repertory of historical and folklore opera . By the time that Mahler began his duties , the progressive camp had gained ascendancy following the appointment of the liberal @-@ minded Ferenc von <unk> as intendant . Aware of the delicate situation , Mahler moved cautiously ; he delayed his first appearance on the conductor 's stand until January 1889 , when he conducted Hungarian language performances of Das Rheingold and Die Walküre to initial public acclaim . However , his early successes faded when plans to stage the remainder of the Ring cycle and other German operas were frustrated by a renascent conservative faction which favoured a more traditional " Hungarian " programme . In search of non @-@ German operas to extend the repertory , Mahler visited Italy where among the works he discovered was Pietro Mascagni 's recent sensation Cavalleria rusticana . 
 In February 1889 , Bernhard Mahler died ; this was followed later in the year by the deaths both of Mahler 's sister <unk> and his mother . Mahler himself suffered poor health , with attacks of haemorrhoids and migraine and a recurrent septic throat . Shortly after these family and health setbacks the premiere of the First Symphony , in Budapest on 21 November 1889 , was a disappointment . The critic August Beer 's lengthy newspaper review indicates that enthusiasm after the early movements degenerated into " audible opposition " after the Finale . Mahler was particularly distressed by the negative comments from his Vienna Conservatory contemporary , Viktor von Herzfeld , who had remarked that Mahler , like many conductors before him , had proved not to be a composer . 
 In 1891 , Hungary 's move to the political right was reflected in the opera house when <unk> was replaced as intendant by Géza Zichy , a conservative aristocrat determined to assume artistic control over Mahler 's head . Mahler began negotiating with the director of the Hamburg Stadttheater ; in May 1891 , having agreed to a contract there , he resigned his Budapest post . His final Budapest triumph was a performance of Don Giovanni which won him praise from Brahms , who was present . During his Budapest years Mahler 's compositional output had been limited to the Wunderhorn song settings that became Volumes II and III of Lieder und Gesänge , and amendments to the First Symphony . 
 = = = = Hamburg Stadttheater = = = = 
 Mahler 's Hamburg post was as chief conductor , subordinate to the director , Bernhard Pohl ( known as Pollini ) who retained overall artistic control . Pollini was prepared to give Mahler considerable leeway if the conductor could provide commercial as well as artistic success . This Mahler did in his first season , when he conducted Wagner 's Tristan und Isolde for the first time and gave acclaimed performances of the same composer 's Tannhäuser and Siegfried . Another triumph was the German premiere of Tchaikovsky 's Eugene Onegin , in the presence of the composer , who called Mahler 's conducting " astounding " , and later asserted in a letter that he believed Mahler was " positively a genius " . Mahler 's demanding rehearsal schedules led to predictable resentment from the singers and orchestra with whom , according to music writer Peter Franklin , the conductor " inspired hatred and respect in almost equal measure . " He found support , however , from Hans von Bülow , who was in Hamburg as director of the city 's subscription concerts . Bülow , who had spurned Mahler 's approaches in Kassel , had come to admire the younger man 's conducting style , and on Bülow 's death in 1894 Mahler took over the direction of the concerts . 
 In the summer of 1892 Mahler took the Hamburg singers to London to participate in a six @-@ week season of German opera — his only visit to Britain . His conducting of Tristan enthralled the young composer Ralph Vaughan Williams , who " staggered home in a daze and could not sleep for two nights . " However , Mahler refused further such invitations as he was anxious to reserve his summers for composing . In 1893 he acquired a retreat at Steinbach , on the banks of Lake <unk> in Upper Austria , and established a pattern that persisted for the rest of his life ; summers would henceforth be dedicated to composition , at Steinbach or its successor retreats . Now firmly under the influence of the Wunderhorn folk @-@ poem collection , Mahler produced a stream of song settings at Steinbach , and composed his Second and Third Symphonies there . 
 Performances of Mahler works were still comparatively rare . On 27 October 1893 , at Hamburg 's Ludwig Konzerthaus , Mahler conducted a revised version of his First Symphony ; still in its original five @-@ movement form , it was presented as a Tondichtung ( tone poem ) under the descriptive name " Titan " . This concert also introduced several recent Wunderhorn settings . Mahler achieved his first relative success as a composer when the Second Symphony was well @-@ received on its premiere in Berlin , under his own baton , on 13 December 1895 . Mahler 's future conducting assistant Bruno Walter , who was present , said that " one may date [ Mahler 's ] rise to fame as a composer from that day . " That same year Mahler 's private life was disrupted by the suicide of his younger brother Otto . 
 At the Stadttheater Mahler introduced numerous new operas : Verdi 's Falstaff , Humperdinck 's Hänsel und Gretel , and works by Smetana . However , he was forced to resign his post with the subscription concerts after poor financial returns and an ill @-@ received interpretation of his re @-@ scored Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony . Mahler had made it clear that his ultimate goal was an appointment in Vienna , and from 1895 onward was manoeuvring , with the help of influential friends , to secure the directorship of the Vienna Hofoper . He overcame the bar that existed against the appointment of a Jew to this post by what may have been a pragmatic conversion to Roman Catholicism in February 1897 . Despite this event , Mahler has been described as a lifelong agnostic .

 As he waited for the Emperor 's confirmation of his directorship , Mahler shared duties as a resident conductor with Joseph Hellmesberger Jr . ( son of the former conservatory director ) and Hans Richter , an internationally renowned interpreter of Wagner and the conductor of the original Ring cycle at Bayreuth in 1876 . Director Wilhelm Jahn had not consulted Richter about Mahler 's appointment ; Mahler , sensitive to the situation , wrote Richter a complimentary letter expressing unswerving admiration for the older conductor . Subsequently the two were rarely in agreement , but kept their divisions private . 
 Vienna , the imperial Habsburg capital , had recently elected an anti @-@ Semitic conservative mayor , Karl Lueger , who had once proclaimed : " I myself decide who is a Jew and who isn 't . " In such a volatile political atmosphere Mahler needed an early demonstration of his German cultural credentials . He made his initial mark in May 1897 with much @-@ praised performances of Wagner 's Lohengrin and Mozart 's Die Zauberflöte . Shortly after the Zauberflöte triumph , Mahler was forced to take sick leave for several weeks , during which he was nursed by his sister Justine and his long @-@ time companion , the viola player Natalie Bauer @-@ Lechner . Mahler returned to Vienna in early August to prepare for Vienna 's first uncut version of the Ring cycle . This performance took place on 24 – 27 August , attracting critical praise and public enthusiasm . Mahler 's friend Hugo Wolf told Bauer @-@ Lechner that " for the first time I have heard the Ring as I have always dreamed of hearing it while reading the score . " 
 On 8 October Mahler was formally appointed to succeed Jahn as the Hofoper 's director . His first production in his new office was Smetana 's Czech nationalist opera Dalibor , with a reconstituted finale that left the hero Dalibor alive . This production caused anger among the more extreme Viennese German nationalists , who accused Mahler of " <unk> with the anti @-@ dynastic , inferior Czech nation " . The Austrian author Stefan Zweig , in his memoirs The World of Yesterday ( 1942 ) , described Mahler 's appointment as an example of the Viennese public 's general distrust of young artists : " Once , when an amazing exception occurred and Gustav Mahler was named director of the Court Opera at thirty @-@ eight years old , a frightened murmur and astonishment ran through Vienna , because someone had entrusted the highest institute of art to ' such a young person ' ... This suspicion – that all young people were ' not very reliable ' – ran through all circles at that time . " Zweig also wrote that " to have seen Gustav Mahler on the street [ in Vienna ] was an event that one would proudly report to his comrades the next morning as it if were a personal triumph . " During Mahler 's tenure a total of 33 new operas were introduced to the Hofoper ; a further 55 were new or totally revamped productions . However , a proposal to stage Richard Strauss 's controversial opera Salome in 1905 was rejected by the Viennese censors . 
 Early in 1902 Mahler met Alfred Roller , an artist and designer associated with the Vienna Secession movement . A year later , Mahler appointed him chief stage designer to the Hofoper , where Roller 's debut was a new production of Tristan und Isolde . The collaboration between Mahler and Roller created more than 20 celebrated productions of , among other operas , Beethoven 's Fidelio , Gluck 's Iphigénie en <unk> and Mozart 's Le nozze di Figaro . In the Figaro production , Mahler offended some purists by adding and composing a short recitative scene to Act III . 
 In spite of numerous theatrical triumphs , Mahler 's Vienna years were rarely smooth ; his battles with singers and the house administration continued on and off for the whole of his tenure . While Mahler 's methods improved standards , his histrionic and dictatorial conducting style was resented by orchestra members and singers alike . In December 1903 Mahler faced a revolt by stagehands , whose demands for better conditions he rejected in the belief that extremists were manipulating his staff . The anti @-@ Semitic elements in Viennese society , long opposed to Mahler 's appointment , continued to attack him relentlessly , and in 1907 instituted a press campaign designed to drive him out . By that time he was at odds with the opera house 's administration over the amount of time he was spending on his own music , and was preparing to leave . Early in 1907 he began discussions with Heinrich <unk> , director of the New York Metropolitan Opera , and in June signed a contract , on very favourable terms , for four seasons ' conducting in New York . At the end of the summer he submitted his resignation to the Hofoper , and on 15 October 1907 conducted Fidelio , his 648th and final performance there . During his ten years in Vienna , Mahler had brought new life to the opera house and cleared its debts , but had won few friends — it was said that he treated his musicians in the way a lion tamer treated his animals . His departing message to the company , which he pinned to a notice board , was later torn down and scattered over the floor . After conducting the Hofoper orchestra in a farewell concert performance of his Second Symphony on 24 November , Mahler left Vienna for New York in early December .

 When Richter resigned as head of the Vienna Philharmonic subscription concerts in September 1898 , the concerts committee had unanimously chosen Mahler as his successor . The appointment was not universally welcomed ; the anti @-@ Semitic press wondered if , as a non @-@ German , Mahler would be capable of defending German music . Attendances rose sharply in Mahler 's first season , but members of the orchestra were particularly resentful of his habit of re @-@ scoring acknowledged masterpieces , and of his scheduling of extra rehearsals for works with which they were thoroughly familiar . An attempt by the orchestra to have Richter reinstated for the 1899 season failed , because Richter was not interested . Mahler 's position was weakened when , in 1900 , he took the orchestra to Paris to play at the Exposition Universelle . The Paris concerts were poorly attended and lost money – Mahler had to borrow the orchestra 's fare home from the Rothschilds . In April 1901 , dogged by a recurrence of ill @-@ health and wearied by more complaints from the orchestra , Mahler relinquished the Philharmonic concerts conductorship . In his three seasons he had performed around 80 different works , which included pieces by relatively unknown composers such as Hermann Goetz , Wilhelm <unk> and the Italian Lorenzo <unk> . 
 = = = = Mature composer = = = = 
 The demands of his twin appointments in Vienna initially absorbed all Mahler 's time and energy , but by 1899 he had resumed composing . The remaining Vienna years were to prove particularly fruitful . While working on the last of his Des Knaben Wunderhorn settings he started his Fourth Symphony , which he completed in 1900 . By this time he had abandoned the composing hut at Steinbach and had acquired another , at Maiernigg on the shores of the <unk> in Carinthia , where he later built a villa . In this new venue Mahler embarked upon what is generally considered as his " middle " or post @-@ Wunderhorn compositional period . Between 1901 and 1904 he wrote ten settings of poems by Friedrich Rückert , five of which were collected as Rückert @-@ Lieder . The other five formed the song cycle Kindertotenlieder ( " Songs on the Death of Children " ) . The trilogy of orchestral symphonies , the Fifth , the Sixth and the Seventh were composed at Maiernigg between 1901 and 1905 , and the Eighth Symphony written there in 1906 , in eight weeks of furious activity . 
 Within this same period Mahler 's works began to be performed with increasing frequency . In April 1899 he conducted the Viennese premiere of his Second Symphony ; 17 February 1901 saw the first public performance of his early work Das klagende Lied , in a revised two @-@ part form . Later that year , in November , Mahler conducted the premiere of his Fourth Symphony , in Munich , and was on the rostrum for the first complete performance of the Third Symphony , at the <unk> Deutscher Musikverein festival at Krefeld on 9 June 1902 . Mahler " first nights " now became increasingly frequent musical events ; he conducted the first performances of the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies at Cologne and Essen respectively , in 1904 and 1906 . Four of the Rückert @-@ Lieder , and Kindertotenlieder , were introduced in Vienna on 29 January 1905 .

 During his second season in Vienna , Mahler acquired a spacious modern apartment on the <unk> and built a summer villa on land he had acquired next to his new composing studio at Maiernigg . In November 1901 , he met Alma Schindler , the stepdaughter of painter Carl Moll , at a social gathering that included the theatre director Max Burckhard . Alma was not initially keen to meet Mahler , on account of " the scandals about him and every young woman who aspired to sing in opera " . The two engaged in a lively disagreement about a ballet by Alexander von Zemlinsky ( Alma was one of Zemlinsky 's pupils ) , but agreed to meet at the Hofoper the following day . This meeting led to a rapid courtship ; Mahler and Alma were married at a private ceremony on 9 March 1902 . Alma was by then pregnant with her first child , a daughter Maria Anna , who was born on 3 November 1902 . A second daughter , Anna , was born in 1904 . 
 Friends of the couple were surprised by the marriage and dubious of its wisdom . Burckhard called Mahler " that <unk> degenerate Jew " , unworthy for such a good @-@ looking girl of good family . On the other hand , Mahler 's family considered Alma to be flirtatious , unreliable , and too fond of seeing young men fall for her charms . Mahler was by nature moody and authoritarian — Natalie Bauer @-@ Lechner , his earlier partner , said that living with him was " like being on a boat that is ceaselessly rocked to and fro by the waves " . Alma soon became resentful because of Mahler 's insistence that there could only be one composer in the family and that she had given up her music studies to accommodate him . She wrote in her diary : " How hard it is to be so mercilessly deprived of ... things closest to one 's heart " . Mahler 's requirement that their married life be organized around his creative activities imposed strains , and precipitated rebellion on Alma 's part ; the marriage was nevertheless marked at times by expressions of considerable passion , particularly from Mahler . 
 In the summer of 1907 Mahler , exhausted from the effects of the campaign against him in Vienna , took his family to Maiernigg . Soon after their arrival both daughters fell ill with scarlet fever and diphtheria . Anna recovered , but after a fortnight 's struggle Maria died on 12 July . Immediately following this devastating loss , Mahler learned that his heart was defective , a diagnosis subsequently confirmed by a Vienna specialist , who ordered a curtailment of all forms of vigorous exercise . The extent to which Mahler 's condition disabled him is unclear ; Alma wrote of it as a virtual death sentence , though Mahler himself , in a letter written to her on 30 August 1907 , said that he would be able to live a normal life , apart from avoiding over @-@ fatigue . The illness was , however , a further depressing factor ; at the end of the summer the villa at Maiernigg was closed , and never revisited .

 Mahler made his New York debut at the Metropolitan Opera on 1 January 1908 , when he conducted Wagner 's Tristan und Isolde in the cut version still standard in New York , though long since superseded in Vienna . In a busy first season Mahler 's performances were widely praised , especially his Fidelio on 20 March 1908 , in which he insisted on using replicas being made of Roller 's Vienna sets . On his return to Austria for the summer of 1908 , Mahler established himself in the third and last of his composing studios , in the pine forests close to Toblach in Tyrol . Here , using a text by Hans <unk> based on ancient Chinese poems , he composed Das Lied von der Erde ( " The Song of the Earth " ) . Despite the symphonic nature of the work , Mahler refused to number it , hoping thereby to escape the " curse of the Ninth Symphony " that he believed had affected fellow @-@ composers Beethoven , Schubert and Bruckner . On 19 September 1908 the premiere of the Seventh Symphony , in Prague , was deemed by Alma Mahler a critical rather than a popular success . 
 For its 1908 – 09 season the Metropolitan management brought in the Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini to share duties with Mahler , who made only 19 appearances in the entire season . One of these was a much @-@ praised performance of Smetana 's The Bartered Bride on 19 February 1909 . In the early part of the season Mahler conducted three concerts with the New York Symphony Orchestra . This renewed experience of orchestral conducting inspired him to resign his position with the opera house and accept the conductorship of the re @-@ formed New York Philharmonic . He continued to make occasional guest appearances at the Met , his last performance being Tchaikovsky 's The Queen of Spades on 5 March 1910 . 
 Back in Europe for the summer of 1909 , Mahler worked on his Ninth Symphony and made a conducting tour of the Netherlands . The 1909 – 10 New York Philharmonic season was long and taxing ; Mahler rehearsed and conducted 46 concerts , but his programmes were often too demanding for popular tastes . His own First Symphony , given its American debut on 16 December 1909 , was one of the pieces that failed with critics and public , and the season ended with heavy financial losses . The highlight of Mahler 's 1910 summer was the first performance of the Eighth Symphony at Munich on 12 September , the last of his works to be premiered in his lifetime . The occasion was a triumph — " easily Mahler 's biggest lifetime success " , according to biographer Robert Carr — but was overshadowed by the composer 's discovery , before the event , that Alma had begun an affair with the young architect Walter Gropius . Greatly distressed , Mahler sought advice from Sigmund Freud , and appeared to gain some comfort from his meeting with the psychoanalyst . One of Freud 's observations was that much damage had been done by Mahler 's insisting that Alma give up her composing . Mahler accepted this , and started to positively encourage her to write music , even editing , orchestrating and promoting some of her works . Alma agreed to remain with Mahler , although the relationship with Gropius continued surreptitiously . In a gesture of love , Mahler dedicated his Eighth Symphony to her . 
 = = = = Illness and death = = = = 
 In spite of the emotional distractions , during the summer of 1910 Mahler worked on his Tenth Symphony , completing the Adagio and drafting four more movements . He and Alma returned to New York in November 1910 , where Mahler threw himself into a busy Philharmonic season of concerts and tours . Around Christmas 1910 he began suffering from a sore throat , which persisted . On 21 February 1911 , with a temperature of 40 ° C ( 104 ° F ) , Mahler insisted on fulfilling an engagement at Carnegie Hall , with a program of mainly new Italian music , including the world premiere of Busoni 's Berceuse <unk> . This was Mahler 's last concert . After weeks confined to bed he was diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis , a disease to which sufferers from defective heart valves were particularly prone , and for which the survival rate in pre @-@ antibiotic days was almost zero . Mahler did not give up hope ; he talked of resuming the concert season , and took a keen interest when one of Alma 's compositions was sung at a public recital by the soprano Frances Alda , on 3 March . On 8 April the Mahler family and a permanent nurse left New York on board SS Amerika bound for Europe . They reached Paris ten days later , where Mahler entered a clinic at Neuilly , but there was no improvement ; on 11 May he was taken by train to the <unk> sanatorium in Vienna , where he died on 18 May . 
 On 22 May 1911 Mahler was buried in the <unk> cemetery ( de ) , as he had requested . Alma , on doctors ' orders , was absent , but among the mourners at a relatively pomp @-@ free funeral were Arnold Schoenberg ( whose wreath described Mahler as " the holy Gustav Mahler " ) , Bruno Walter , Alfred Roller , the Secessionist painter Gustav <unk> , and representatives from many of the great European opera houses . The New York Times , reporting Mahler 's death , called him " one of the towering musical figures of his day " , but discussed his symphonies mainly in terms of their duration , incidentally exaggerating the length of the Second Symphony to " two hours and forty minutes " . In London , The Times obituary said his conducting was " more accomplished than that of any man save Richter " , and that his symphonies were " undoubtedly interesting in their union of modern orchestral richness with a melodic simplicity that often approached banality " , though it was too early to judge their ultimate worth . 
 Alma Mahler survived her husband by more than 50 years , dying in 1964 . She married Walter Gropius in 1915 , divorced him five years later , and married the writer Franz Werfel in 1929 . In 1940 she published a memoir of her years with Mahler , entitled Gustav Mahler : Memories and Letters . This account was criticised by later biographers as incomplete , selective and self @-@ serving , and for providing a distorted picture of Mahler 's life . The composer 's daughter Anna Mahler became a well @-@ known sculptor ; she died in 1988 . The International Gustav Mahler Society was founded in 1955 in Vienna , with Bruno Walter as its first president and Alma Mahler as an honorary member . The Society aims to create a complete critical edition of Mahler 's works , and to commemorate all aspects of the composer 's life .

 = = = Three creative periods = = = 
 Deryck Cooke and other analysts have divided Mahler 's composing life into three distinct phases : a long " first period " , extending from Das klagende Lied in 1880 to the end of the Wunderhorn phase in 1901 ; a " middle period " of more concentrated composition ending with Mahler 's departure for New York in 1907 ; and a brief " late period " of elegiac works before his death in 1911 . 
 The main works of the first period are the first four symphonies , the Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen song cycle and various song collections in which the Wunderhorn songs predominate . In this period songs and symphonies are closely related and the symphonic works are programmatic . Mahler initially gave the first three symphonies full descriptive programmes , all of which he later repudiated . He devised , but did not publish , titles for each of the movements for the Fourth Symphony ; from these titles the German music critic Paul Bekker conjectured a programme in which Death appears in the Scherzo " in the friendly , legendary guise of the fiddler tempting his flock to follow him out of this world " . 
 The middle period comprises a triptych of purely instrumental symphonies ( the Fifth , Sixth and Seventh ) , the Rückert songs and the Kindertotenlieder , two final Wunderhorn settings and , in some reckonings , Mahler 's last great affirmative statement , the choral Eighth Symphony . Cooke believes that the Eighth stands on its own , between the middle and final periods . Mahler had by now abandoned all explicit programmes and descriptive titles ; he wanted to write " absolute " music that spoke for itself . Cooke refers to " a new granite @-@ like hardness of orchestration " in the middle @-@ period symphonies , while the songs have lost most of their folk character , and cease to fertilise the symphonies as explicitly as before . 
 The works of the brief final period — Das Lied von der Erde , the Ninth and ( incomplete ) Tenth Symphonies — are expressions of personal experience , as Mahler faced death . Each of the pieces ends quietly , signifying that aspiration has now given way to resignation . Cooke considers these works to be a loving ( rather than a bitter ) farewell to life ; the composer Alban Berg called the Ninth " the most marvellous thing that Mahler ever wrote " . None of these final works were performed in Mahler 's lifetime . 
 = = = Antecedents and influences = = = 
 Mahler was a " late Romantic " , part of an ideal that placed Austro @-@ German classical music on a higher plane than other types , through its supposed possession of particular spiritual and philosophical significance . He was one of the last major composers of a line which includes , among others , Beethoven , Schubert , Liszt , Wagner , Bruckner and Brahms . From these antecedents Mahler drew many of the features that were to characterise his music . Thus , from Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony came the idea of using soloists and a choir within the symphonic genre . From Beethoven , Liszt and ( from a different musical tradition ) Berlioz came the concept of writing music with an inherent narrative or " programme " , and of breaking away from the traditional four @-@ movement symphony format . The examples of Wagner and Bruckner encouraged Mahler to extend the scale of his symphonic works well beyond the previously accepted standards , to embrace an entire world of feeling . 
 Early critics maintained that Mahler 's adoption of many different styles to suit different expressions of feeling meant that he lacked a style of his own ; Cooke on the other hand asserts that Mahler " redeemed any borrowings by imprinting his [ own ] personality on practically every note " to produce music of " outstanding originality . " The music critic Harold Schonberg sees the essence of Mahler 's music in the theme of struggle , in the tradition of Beethoven . However , according to Schonberg , Beethoven 's struggles were those of " an indomitable and triumphant hero " , whereas Mahler 's are those of " a psychic weakling , a complaining adolescent who ... enjoyed his misery , wanting the whole world to see how he was suffering . " Yet , Schonberg concedes , most of the symphonies contain sections in which Mahler the " deep thinker " is transcended by the splendour of Mahler the musician . 
 = = = Genre = = = 
 Except for his juvenilia , few of which have survived , Mahler composed only in the media of song and symphony , with a close and complex interrelationship between the two . Donald Mitchell writes that this interaction is the backcloth against which all Mahler 's music can be considered . The initial connection between song and symphony occurs with the song @-@ cycle Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen and the First Symphony . Although this early evidence of cross @-@ fertilisation is important , it is during Mahler 's extended Wunderhorn phase , in which his Second , Third and Fourth Symphonies were written , that the song and symphony genres are consistently intermingled . Themes from the Wunderhorn song Das <unk> Leben ( " The Heavenly Life " ) , composed in 1892 , became a key element in the Third Symphony completed in 1896 ; the song itself forms the finale to the Fourth ( 1900 ) and its melody is central to the whole composition . For the Second Symphony , written between 1888 and 1894 , Mahler worked simultaneously on the Wunderhorn song , Des Antonius von Padua <unk> ( " The Sermon of St Anthony of Padua to the Fishes " ) , and on the Scherzo based on it which became the symphony 's third movement . Another Wunderhorn setting from 1892 , <unk> ( " Primal Light " ) , is used as the Second Symphony 's fourth ( penultimate ) movement . 
 In Mahler 's middle and late periods , the song @-@ symphony relationship is less direct . However , musicologist Donald Mitchell notes specific relationships between the middle period songs and their contemporaneous symphonies — the second Kindertotenlieder song and the Adagietto from the Fifth Symphony , the last Kindertotenlieder song and the Sixth Symphony finale . Mahler 's last work employing vocal and orchestral forces , Das Lied von der Erde , is subtitled " A Symphony ... " — Mitchell categorises it as a " song and symphony " . 
 = = = Style = = = 
 The union of song and symphonic form in Mahler 's music is , in Cooke 's view , organic ; " his songs flower naturally into symphonic movements , being already symphonic in cast . " To Sibelius , Mahler expressed the belief that " The symphony must be like the world . It must embrace everything . " True to this belief , Mahler drew material from many sources into his songs and symphonic works : bird calls and cow @-@ bells to evoke nature and the countryside , bugle fanfares , street melodies and country dances to summon the lost world of his childhood . Life 's struggles are represented in contrasting moods : the yearning for fulfilment by soaring melodies and chromatic harmony , suffering and despair by discord , distortion and grotesquerie . Amid all this is Mahler 's particular hallmark — the constant intrusion of banality and absurdity into moments of deep seriousness , typified in the second movement of the Fifth Symphony when a trivial popular tune suddenly cuts into a solemn funeral march . The trite melody soon changes its character , and in due course re @-@ emerges as one of the majestic Brucknerian chorales which Mahler uses to signify hope and the resolution of conflict . Mahler himself recognised the idiosyncrasies in his work , calling the Scherzo in the Third Symphony " the most farcical and at the same time the most tragic piece that ever existed ... It is as though all nature is making faces and sticking out its tongue . " 
 The range of musical moods , Cooke maintains , comes from Mahler 's " amazing orchestration " which , in the writer 's view , defies analysis — " it speaks for itself " . Franklin lists specific features which are basic to Mahler 's style : extremes of volume , the use of off @-@ stage ensembles , unconventional arrangement of orchestral forces , and frequent recourse to popular music and dance forms such as the <unk> and the waltz . Musicologist Vladimír <unk> maintains that the composer 's Jewish roots had lasting effects on his creative output ; he pinpoints the central part of the third movement of the First Symphony as the most characteristically " Yiddish " music in Mahler 's work . The Czech composer @-@ journalist Max Brod has also identified Jewish tunes and rhythms in Mahler 's music . 
 A technical device much used by Mahler is that of " progressive tonality " , which Deryck Cooke describes as " the procedure of resolving a symphonic conflict in a different key from that in which it was stated " , and which is often used " to symbolise the gradual ascendancy of a certain value by progress from one key to another over the whole course of a symphony " . This technique was also used by Mahler 's Danish contemporary Carl Nielsen . Mahler first employed the device in an early song , Erinnerung ( " Memory " ) , and thereafter used it freely in his symphonies . For example , the predominant key of the First Symphony is D major ; at the beginning of the Finale , the " conflict " movement , the key switches to F minor , and only after a lengthy battle gets back to D , near the end . The Second Symphony begins in C minor and ends in E flat . The movements of the Fifth Symphony progress successively from C @-@ sharp minor to A minor , then D major , F major and finally to D major . The Sixth Symphony , unusually for Mahler , begins and ends in the same key , A minor , signifying that in this case the conflict is unresolved .

 Mahler 's friend Guido Adler calculated that at the time of the composer 's death in 1911 there had been more than 260 performances of the symphonies in Europe , Russia and America , the Fourth Symphony with 61 performances given most frequently ( Adler did not enumerate performances of the songs ) . In his lifetime , Mahler 's works and their performances attracted wide interest , but rarely unqualified approval ; for years after its 1889 premiere critics and public struggled to understand the First Symphony , described by one critic after an 1898 Dresden performance as " the dullest [ symphonic ] work the new epoch has produced . " The Second Symphony was received more positively , one critic calling it " the most masterly work of its kind since Mendelssohn " . Such generous praise was rare , particularly after Mahler 's accession to the Vienna Hofoper directorship . His many enemies in the city used the anti @-@ Semitic and conservative press to denigrate almost every performance of a Mahler work ; thus the Third Symphony , a success in Krefeld in 1902 , was treated in Vienna with critical scorn : " Anyone who has committed such a deed deserves a couple of years in prison . " 
 A mix of enthusiasm , consternation and critical contempt became the normal response to new Mahler symphonies , although the songs were better received . After his Fourth and Fifth Symphonies failed to gain general public approval , Mahler was convinced that his Sixth would finally succeed . However , its reception was dominated by satirical comments on Mahler 's unconventional percussion effects — the use of a wooden mallet , birch rods and a huge square bass drum . Viennese critic Heinrich Reinhardt dismissed the symphony as " Brass , lots of brass , incredibly much brass ! Even more brass , nothing but brass ! " The one unalloyed performance triumph within Mahler 's lifetime was the premiere of the Eighth Symphony in Munich , on 12 September 1910 , advertised by its promoters as the " Symphony of a Thousand " . At its conclusion , applause and celebrations reportedly lasted for half an hour .

 Performances of Mahler 's works became less frequent after his death . In the Netherlands the advocacy of Willem Mengelberg ensured that Mahler remained popular there , and Mengelberg 's engagement with the New York Philharmonic from 1922 to 1928 brought Mahler regularly to American audiences . However , much American critical reaction in the 1920s was negative , despite a spirited effort by the young composer Aaron Copland to present Mahler as a progressive , 30 years ahead of his time and infinitely more inventive than Richard Strauss . Earlier , in 1916 , Leopold Stokowski had given the American premieres of the Eighth Symphony and Das Lied von der Erde in Philadelphia . The Eighth was a sensationally successful performance that was immediately taken to New York where it scored a further triumph . In Britain the Hallé Orchestra brought Das Lied and the Ninth Symphony to Manchester in 1931 ; Sir Henry Wood staged the Eighth in London in 1930 , and again in 1938 when the young Benjamin Britten found the performance " execrable " but was nevertheless impressed by the music . British critics during this period largely treated Mahler with condescension and faint praise . Thus Dyneley Hussey , writing in 1934 , thought the " children 's songs " were delightful , but that the symphonies should be let go . Composer @-@ conductor Julius Harrison described Mahler 's symphonies as " interesting at times , but laboriously put together " and as lacking creative spark . Bernard Shaw , in his role as music critic , thought that the musical audiences of the 1930s would find Mahler ( and Bruckner ) " expensively second @-@ rate " . 
 Before Mahler 's music was banned as " degenerate " during the Nazi era , the symphonies and songs were played in the concert halls of Germany and Austria , often conducted by Bruno Walter or Mahler 's younger assistant Otto Klemperer , and also by Willem Mengelberg . In Austria , Mahler 's work experienced a brief renaissance between 1934 and 1938 , a period known today as ' <unk> ' , when the authoritarian regime with the help of Alma Mahler and Bruno Walter , who were both on friendly terms with the new chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg , sought to make Mahler into a national icon ( with a status comparable to that of Wagner in Germany ) . Mahler 's music was performed during the Nazi era in Berlin in early 1941 and in Amsterdam during the German occupation of the Netherlands by Jewish orchestras and for Jewish audiences alone ; works performed included the Second Symphony ( Berlin ) , the First and Fourth Symphonies , and the Songs of a Wayfarer ( Amsterdam ) . 
 = = = = Modern revival = = = = 
 According to American composer David Schiff , his compatriot Leonard Bernstein used to imply that he had single @-@ handedly rescued Mahler from oblivion in 1960 , after 50 years of neglect . Schiff points out that such neglect was only relative — far less than the disregard of Bach in the years after his death . Although Bernstein gave the Mahler revival further impetus , it was well under way before 1960 , sustained by conductors such as Stokowski , Dimitri Mitropoulos and John Barbirolli , and by the long @-@ time Mahler advocate Aaron Copland . 
 Deryck Cooke argues that Mahler 's popularity escalated when a new , postwar generation of music @-@ lovers arose , untainted by " the dated polemics of anti @-@ romanticism " which had affected Mahler 's reputation in the inter @-@ war years . In this more liberated age , enthusiasm for Mahler expanded even into places — Spain , France , Italy — which had long been resistant to him . Robert Carr 's simpler explanation for the 1950s Mahler revival is that " it was the long @-@ playing record [ in the early 1950s ] rather than the Zeitgeist which made a comprehensive breakthrough possible . Mahler 's work became accessible and repeatable in the home . " In the years following his centenary in 1960 , Mahler rapidly became one of the most performed and most recorded of all composers , and has largely remained thus . In Britain and elsewhere , Carr notes , the extent of Mahler performances and recordings has replaced a relative famine with a glut , bringing problems of over @-@ familiarity . Harold Schonberg comments that " it is hard to think of a composer who arouses equal loyalty " , adding that " a response of anything short of rapture to the Mahler symphonies will bring [ to the critic ] long letters of furious denunciation " . 
 In a letter to Alma dated 16 February 1902 , Mahler wrote , with reference to Richard Strauss : " My day will come when his is ended . If only I might live to see it , with you at my side ! " Carr observes that Mahler could conceivably have lived to see " his day " ; his near @-@ contemporary Richard Strauss survived until 1949 , while Sibelius , just five years younger than Mahler , lived until 1957 . 
 = = = Later influence = = = 
 Donald Mitchell writes that Mahler 's influence on succeeding generations of composers is " a complete subject in itself " . Mahler 's first disciples included Arnold Schoenberg and his pupils Alban Berg and Anton Webern , who together founded the Second Viennese School . Mahler 's music influenced the trio 's move from progressive <unk> to atonality ( music without a key ) ; although Mahler rejected atonality , he became a fierce defender of the bold originality of Schoenberg 's work . At the premiere of the latter 's First String Quartet in February 1907 , Mahler reportedly was held back from physically attacking the hecklers . Schoenberg 's Serenade , Op. 24 ( 1923 ) , Berg 's Three Pieces for Orchestra ( 1915 ) and Webern 's Six Pieces ( 1928 ) all carry echoes of Mahler 's Seventh Symphony . 
 Among other composers whose work carries the influence of Mahler , Mitchell lists America 's Aaron Copland , the German song and stage composer Kurt Weill , Italy 's Luciano Berio , Russia 's Dmitri Shostakovich and England 's Benjamin Britten . The American composers Leonard Bernstein and Samuel Barber were also influenced by Mahler 's work . In a 1989 interview the pianist @-@ conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy said that the connection between Mahler and Shostakovich was " very strong and obvious " ; their music represented " the individual versus the vices of the world . " Mitchell highlights Britten 's " marvellously keen , spare and independent writing for the wind in ... the first movement of the Cello Symphony of 1963 [ which ] clearly belongs to that order of dazzling transparency and instrumental emancipation which Mahler did so much to establish " . Mitchell concludes with the statement : " Even were his own music not to survive , Mahler would still enjoy a substantial immortality in the music of these pre @-@ eminent successors who have embraced his art and assimilated his techniques .

 Mary Meader was born to William H. and Genevieve Upjohn in Kalamazoo , Michigan on April 15 , 1916 , a grandchild of Dr. W. E. Upjohn , the founder of the pharmaceutical Upjohn Company . Meader majored in French and Spanish at Smith College . She left the college in preparation for a marriage to the neurosurgeon Richard Upjohn Light , a first cousin of hers . Since the two could not legally marry each other in Michigan , they moved to Maryland , where they married in 1937 . 
 = = The flight = = 
 Dr. Light became famous among aviation enthusiasts due to his 1934 around @-@ the @-@ world flight . To celebrate his marriage to Meader , he wished to approximate the same , and Meader was happy to comply . During the planning of the trip , many points on Earth had not been captured on film from the air and the American Geographical Society promoted these photographic flights , as they were trying to build an aerial collection . Light 's idea was to travel across areas South America and Africa never been aerially photographed . 
 Meader took flying lessons and learned morse code so she could become her husband 's co @-@ pilot , navigator , and radio operator . During this training , her first son , Christopher , was born . In an interview with Encore Magazine in 2006 , when asked why she decided to take the journey , she replied : 
 " It just seemed like a great adventure — something I wanted to do . Why ? I 'm not certain , other than we both knew we would be doing something that hadn 't been done before . " 
 The two Lights took off out of Kalamazoo in September 1937 in a <unk> monoplane . Its cabin lacked heat or pressurization . To survive , they were forced to breathe oxygen from a tank out wooden mouthpieces . Wearing a fur coat and boots , Meader took photographs out of a window frame . 
 The Lights were banned from photographing all of Central America except Guatemala , Ecuador , and Colombia , as a safety measure against the gathering of strategic knowledge . They took advantage of the Peruvian government 's <unk> to take pictures in the air by capturing the earliest photographs of the Nazca lines . These were unable to distinguish from the surface , though further into the atmosphere the designs can range from simple patterns to hummingbirds and llamas . 
 Following their <unk> of South America , the couple crossed the Atlantic Ocean before arriving in Cape Town , South Africa . While there , she took a picture of the ice dome and crater of Mount Kilimanjaro and of the <unk> and pinnacles on Mount Kenya . Her photographs include different views of native villages , urban areas , and the Egyptian pyramids , among other subjects . Every day they would awake at 4 a.m. , fly until 11 a.m , then visit some of the farms , mines , and native settlements Meader planned to photograph the following day . 
 The couple 's original plan was to fly into Asia ; however , this was not accomplished due to the damaging of the plane and Meader 's pregnancy with a second child , Timothy . The two returned to Kalamazoo in February 1938 . In all , Meader took over 2 @,@ 000 photographs on her two flights . 
 = = Later life and philanthropy = = 
 Three hundred twenty @-@ three of Meader 's African photos were included in Focus on Africa , a 1941 book written by her husband and published by the American Geographical Society . The book was only their second which included aerial photos ; the first was Peru from the Air by George R. Johnson published in 1930 . A review of the book by Mary Jobe Akeley of the New York Times called her pictures " superb " . In addition , the photos have been featured in several exhibitions over the years . 
 Meader was a member of the Society of Woman Geographers since 1942 , whom granted her the Outstanding Achievement Award for her pioneering aerial photography in 2005 . Light and Meader divorced in the early 1960s . In 1965 , Meader married Edwin Meader , a geography professor . The new couple settled on a farm outside of Kalamazoo , and according to Western Michigan University president emeritus Diether <unk> , " for years their barn loft was one of Kalamazoo 's foremost intellectual meeting places " . They donated millions of dollars to Western Michigan University , the University of Michigan , and various Kalamazoo charities . Mrs. Meader traveled to an elementary school to teach children how to read into her 70s . 
 One of her largest gifts was her donation of $ 4 million to Western Michigan University . It resulted in the creation of the W.E. Upjohn Center for the Study of Geographical Change , after her grandfather . It digitizes maps and aerial photographs from all over the world and documents and evaluates geographic changes . She also donated $ 1 million gift to <unk> 's Waldo Library for a library renovation in the early 1990s and helped construct the W.H. Upjohn Rotunda , which was named after Meader 's father . The Edwin and Mary Meader Rare Book Room was later dedicated to the library . The Meaders also gave $ 18 million to the University of Michigan , Edwin Meader 's alma mater , in 2004 -- $ 8 million to U @-@ M 's Kelsey Museum of Archaeology , which was the largest gift ever to U @-@ M 's College of Literature , Science and the Arts , and $ 10 million to build a center for the study of depression , which was named the Rachel Upjohn Building after W.E. Upjohn 's first wife . 
 On November 21 , 2006 , Meader was awarded the title of honorary member of the American Geographical Society and was invited to sign her name on its Fliers ' & Explorers ' Globe . This was part of a tradition spanning back to the 1920s in which noted explorers are asked to place their signature on the Globe . Meader was the 79th to do so . Other signers of the globe include Charles Lindbergh , Amelia Earhart , Sir Edmund Hillary , Robert Peary , Richard Byrd , and the astronauts on Apollo 8 . Meader was one of only three people to sign it twice ; across East Africa and the Andes . 
 Mary Meader died on March 16 , 2008 in Kalamazoo at the age of 91 . Her husband died one year before . Survivors include sons Christopher , Timothy , and John , of Kalamazoo , and Rudolph , of Ukiah , California ; seven grandchildren ; and five great @-@ grandchildren . 
 = Avalanche Studios = 
 Avalanche Studios is a video game developer based in Stockholm , Sweden . It was founded in March 2003 by Christofer Sundberg and Linus Blomberg . Avalanche Studios focuses on developing open world projects and bases them on the Avalanche Engine . Formed after the collapse of Rock Solid Games , the studio has expanded from six members to 250 staff members . 
 As well as their main studio in Stockholm , they have two further studios : a studio in New York City , that worked on Just Cause 3 ; and a subsidiary studio in Stockholm named Expansive Worlds , that worked on theHunter . 
 Since the company 's establishment , it has worked on multiple projects , including the Just Cause series of open world action @-@ adventure games published by Eidos Interactive and Square Enix , and Mad Max . They have also developed some relatively less popular games including the free @-@ to @-@ play theHunter , top @-@ down shooter Renegade Ops and Rumble City , their first mobile game . The company aims to begin self @-@ publishing new original intellectual properties in the future .

 Avalanche Studios was founded by Christofer Sundberg and Linus Blomberg in 2003 . Prior to the establishment of the studio , Sundberg had worked in video game publishing as well as FIFA Soccer for Electronic Arts . Both of them joined Paradox Interactive , a video game publisher that had published games such as Europa Universalis . Eventually , Sundberg and Blomberg left and founded their own company called Rock Solid Studios during the second quarter of 2001 . The company partnered with Conspiracy Entertainment to develop a video game adaptation of Tremors , a movie series from Universal Pictures . Titled Tremors : The Game , it was set to be released for personal computers , PlayStation 2 , Xbox and Nintendo GameCube in 2003 . During that period , another Stockholm @-@ based video game development studio , Starbreeze Studios , announced that they would acquire Rock Solid . The agreement between the two companies was ultimately broken by Starbreeze , and the acquisition was stopped . In addition , Universal decided to cancel Tremors : The Game , which led Rock Solid to declare bankruptcy . With the failure and collapse of Rock Solid , Sundberg and Blomberg became unemployed and in debt . They eventually decided to start over in 2003 , establishing Avalanche Studios with six other employees . Reflecting on the founding in 2015 , Sundberg stated that the studio was born in " pure chaos " , and attributed their failure with Rock Solid to trusting " the wrong people " . 
 = = = 2003 @-@ 2010 = = = 
 When naming the company , Sundberg , Blomberg and the other employees brought up a list of military code words used during World War II . They ultimately decided upon " Avalanche " as the company 's name . The company worked on a prototype project called Rico : Terror in the Tropics in 2003 . The project , designed by Sundberg himself , would eventually become Avalanche 's first title , Just Cause . He pitched the game 's concept to publisher Eidos Interactive , which was accepted . According to Sundberg , he wanted to develop a game " where you could skydive onto the roof of a car and keep on going " . The game was released in 2006 for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 . Sundberg considered Just Cause to be the ' DNA ' and ' center point of the studio ' , since it was the first game they developed . 
 Following Just Cause , Avalanche began to provide technical assistance to theHunter . Originally developed and published by <unk> Games , the franchise was acquired by Avalanche on 18 February 2010 . As theHunter is an online @-@ activated games , Avalanche established a subsidiary studio called Expansive Worlds on 24 March 2010 to provide support to the continuous development of theHunter . The new studio will also work on new online games . 
 Also in development during Avalanche 's work on theHunter was AionGuard and Just Cause 2 . AionGuard is a fantasy video game that was ultimately put on hold . Just Cause 2 was announced in January 2008 . Powered by the Avalanche Engine 2 @.@ 0 , Avalanche Studios ' in @-@ house engine , the game included several new and improved features . Originally set to be released in 2008 , the game subsequently missed its target release window . In 2008 , the studio suffered from layoffs ; Avalanche dismissed 77 staff members after the company lost approximately US $ 35 million due to the loss of two contracted projects . One of them was later leaked as Arcadia , a game that was once was to be published by THQ . After the incident , Sundberg claimed that the company would remain as a small studio in the future . Just Cause 2 was not released in 2009 , which was regarded as " a bad year for most companies including ourselves " by Sundberg . In May 2009 , 20 more employees were laid @-@ off . Despite Avalanche 's layoffs , development of Just Cause 2 was completed , and the game was launched in March 2010 for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . 
 = = = 2011 = = = 
 Upon the completion of Just Cause 2 , Avalanche teased a new project . A new downloadable title , called Renegade Ops , was announced on 30 March 2011 . The team was approached by Sega to develop a new downloadable intellectual property using the Avalanche Engine . Compared to their past titles , the game 's production and development periods were much shorter . Renegade Ops was released on 14 October 2011 . 
 On 15 June 2011 , Avalanche announced that the company would establish a new division in New York City . The studio was officially opened on 17 November 2011 , and the first title set to be developed by the New York division was revealed . Codenamed Project <unk> , the title was a AAA video game set to be released for " next @-@ gen " consoles and PC in 2014 . The new studio is located in SoHo , Manhattan , and is led by David <unk> , who was a former employee of Activision and Atari , SA . According to <unk> , Avalanche Studios chose New York City as their location due to less competition . They also aimed to change the " inhospitable " environment of the game industry there . 
 = = = 2012 @-@ 15 = = = 
 In 2012 , Avalanche began the development of Mad Max . Prior to the game 's development , Avalanche had pitched several projects that were set in a post @-@ apocalyptic environment to different publishers . While the original projects never came to fruition , an opportunity was presented to Avalanche Studios by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment to develop a video game set within the Mad Max universe . Film director and creator of the Mad Max franchise , George Miller , was consulted during the game 's pre @-@ production period . Cory Barlog , the creator of God of War II , joined the studio in 2010 and left in 2012 . Prior to his arrival , he had already been working on a Mad Max game with Miller , leading to a confusing relationship between the two projects . In August 2014 , Avalanche Studios announced that they were developing several new projects , calling 2015 " the biggest year since the inception of Avalanche Studios more than a decade ago " . In addition , the company announced that the Stockholm @-@ based studio would be moved to a larger building for further expansion in the third quarter of 2015 . Mad Max was originally set to be released in 2014 , but was delayed to September 2015 . 
 While Mad Max was being developed by Avalanche 's studio in Stockholm , the New York division was working on Just Cause 3 . The development of Just Cause 3 also began in early 2012 . While the previous Just Cause games were developed by the Swedish studio , the development of Just Cause 3 was transferred to the New York studio to give the title a fresh start . The game will be the first title to be published by Square Enix after their acquisition of Eidos Interactive . Avalanche Studios sent a team to visit a jungle in Costa Rica to inspect the local landscapes and environments to help them create the game worlds for both Mad Max and Just Cause 3 . 
 In addition to Mad Max and Just Cause 3 , " a standalone expansion of theHunter featuring dinosaurs , titled theHunter : Primal , was released on Steam 's early access on 15 December 2014 . The full game was launched on 31 March 2015 . The company also released their first mobile title called Rumble City . It is a turn @-@ based strategy games and was released on 7 July 2015 . 
 In October 2015 , the company announced that both the New York office and the Stockholm office suffered minor lay @-@ offs as the studio was undergoing major transition between projects and that it was unable to maintain multiple large teams during this period . In June 2016 , the Sweden office announced that they had hired Cameron Foote , the lead designer of Just Cause 2 's multiplayer mod , to work on both Avalanche 's " present and future projects " .

 Just Cause is a series of open world action @-@ adventure games starring Rico Rodriguez as the protagonist , an operative from " The Agency " , a military organization in Just Cause and Just Cause 2 . The series is known for allowing players to create chaos and providing players freedom in exploring the game 's world . Gameplay revolves around gunplay and the use of the grappling hook and parachute . While the original Just Cause was not particularly well received by critics , its sequel , Just Cause 2 , received critical acclaim . The PC version of the game received an 84 out of 100 from Metacritic , a review aggregator . Some reviewers also regarded the game as " one of the most entertaining sandbox shooters ever created " . Upon release , Just Cause 2 was proven to be more popular than its predecessors ; over 2 million players played the game 's demo , and over 6 million players purchased the final game . As the game did not ship with any multiplayer feature , a multiplayer PC mod , which can accommodate more than one thousands players in a single map , was created by a <unk> . Avalanche Studios supported the mod , made the mod official on 16 December 2013 , and released the mod on Steam as free downloadable content for players who had purchased the game . Just Cause 3 , the latest title in the series , was released for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on December 1 , 2015 . Sundberg considered the collaboration with Square Enix as " a long @-@ term partnership " . During Square Enix 's E3 2015 press conference , Square Enix of America CEO , Phil Rogers , stated that he considered Just Cause a major franchise that can stand " side by side " with other iconic Square Enix franchises .

 The team also worked on theHunter , a free @-@ to @-@ play hunting video game . The game is a commercial success for Avalanche , with Sundberg claiming that the title " contribute [ s ] quite a lot to [ Avalanche 's ] financial success " . Avalanche considered theHunter to be an experiment for them to see whether the free @-@ to @-@ play business model suited the company or not . Renegade Ops is another original title from Avalanche . It is a top down shooter which had drawn inspirations from 1986 's Jackal , 1992 's Desert Strike : Return to the Gulf and 1993 's Cannon Fodder . The team aimed to " recreate classics " with Renegade Ops , similar to 2010 's Shadow Complex . The game received generally positive reviews upon release . Avalanche Studios ' first mobile game , titled Rumble City , is a strategy board game which takes inspiration from the American bike culture during the 1960s . It was released in July 2015 for iOS and Android devices . Avalanche Studios is set to be collaborating with Square Enix on the development of the airship segment of Final Fantasy XV . 
 The studio also worked on several cancelled projects . In 2009 , Avalanche announced AionGuard , a God of War @-@ style open world fantasy game which features World War I fighters , samurais and knights for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 . Influences for the game were drawn from Star Wars and works from Frank Herbert and Michael Moorcock . However , the project was eventually put on hold indefinitely in 2010 . In 2012 , the company announced a non @-@ Superman comic book game , which was eventually cancelled in 2014 . The studio almost collaborated with LucasArts to develop an open world video game based on the Star Wars universe . A steampunk @-@ themed game was also reported to be in development , but was later put on hold . 
 = = Philosophy = = 
 Starting from Avalanche Studios ' inception , the company 's primary focus is to create open world sandbox games , citing Elite as their inspiration . According to Blomberg , the studio has always been interested in creating open world games , and they aimed to be " the best " in developing them . The company seeks to remain flexible to market changes and tries not to limit themselves to one business model . Avalanche also focuses on developing games with long gameplay length and high replay value . Sundberg considers Avalanche Studios to be an independent company , and often keeps the rights to their intellectual properties . Sundberg also stated that video game developers should not put too much weight in income ; as a result , the company seldom develops " forced " multiplayer modes , as they believe that approach " makes absolutely no sense " and does not add any value to the game . When seeking future projects , the studio chooses projects that they are passionate about and allow creative freedom . They only make games that " [ they ] love to play " or games that " can bring a smile to people 's faces " . 
 Sundberg described the company as " family @-@ driven " . Sundberg and Blomberg do not have their own offices in the studio , as they want to maintain a close relationship with their staff members . The two also seek to be closely involved with all their ongoing projects .

 Charles Slaughter Morehead ( July 7 , 1802 – December 21 , 1868 ) was a U.S. Representative from Kentucky , and served as the 20th Governor of Kentucky . Though a member of the Whig Party for most of his political service , he joined the Know Nothing , or American , Party in 1855 , and was the only governor of Kentucky ever elected from that party . 
 Morehead 's political service began in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1828 . In 1832 , he was appointed state attorney general . He served in this capacity for five years , and later returned to the Kentucky House , where he was chosen Speaker of the House three times . He was elected to Congress in 1848 and served two terms . After his congressional tenure , he joined the Know Nothing Party and was chosen as the party 's candidate for governor in 1855 . The campaign was marred by anti @-@ immigrant and anti @-@ Catholic rhetoric that touched off the " Bloody Monday " riots in Louisville . 
 Morehead was a delegate to the Peace Conference of 1861 and the Border States Convention that attempted to stave off the Civil War . Although he favored Kentucky 's neutrality , Morehead sympathized with the South and was an open critic of the Lincoln administration . He was imprisoned for disloyalty in September 1861 , although no formal charges were ever brought against him . He was released from prison in January 1862 , and afterward fled to Canada , Europe , and Mexico . After the war , he returned to the United States and settled on his plantation in Greenville , Mississippi , where he died on December 21 , 1868 .

 Charles Slaughter Morehead was born near Bardstown , Nelson County , Kentucky on July 7 , 1802 . He was the son of Charles and Margaret ( Slaughter ) Morehead and a first cousin to Kentucky 's twelfth governor , James Turner Morehead . His father served in both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly . 
 Morehead was educated in the area 's public schools , then matriculated to Transylvania University . He earned a bachelor 's degree in 1820 , graduating with honors . After graduation , he became a tutor at the university and earned a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1822 . He relocated to Christian County , Kentucky , was admitted to the bar , and commenced practice in Hopkinsville . He also worked as a farmer , and owned plantations in Mississippi and Louisiana . 
 Morehead married Amanda Leavy on July 10 , 1823 . She died July 5 , 1829 at the age of twenty @-@ five . Following her death , Morehead married Margaret Leavy , his first wife 's sister , on September 6 , 1831 . Together they had four children . Charles and Margaret were very fond of music , theater , dances , and parties .

 Morehead was elected as a Whig to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1828 and was re @-@ elected in 1829 . Following his second term in the legislature , he moved to Frankfort , Kentucky , believing it provided better opportunities for his legal practice . He was appointed as state attorney general in 1832 and served for five years . In 1834 , he co @-@ authored A Digest of the Statute Laws of Kentucky with Mason Brown . He represented Franklin County in the state house from 1838 to 1842 and again in 1844 ; he was chosen Speaker of the House in 1840 , 1841 , and 1844 . 
 Morehead was elected the Thirtieth and Thirty @-@ first Congresses , serving from March 4 , 1847 until March 3 , 1851 . During the Thirty @-@ first Congress , the Whig caucus considered him as a candidate for Speaker of the House . The voting for speaker began December 3 , 1849 . The caucus first chose Robert C. Winthrop as their candidate , but after several ballots , Winthrop was still unable to obtain a majority because of sectional rivalries within the caucus . Some Whigs from northern states voted for David Wilmot , a Free <unk> , while five southern Whigs steadfastly voted for Meredith Gentry . The Democrats were similarly unable to muster a majority for their candidate , Howell Cobb . 
 At their caucus meeting on the night of December 10 , the Whigs agreed to continue voting for Winthrop for one more day , and if he was not elected , to switch their support to Morehead , who they believed could hold all of Winthrop 's votes and win the votes of the southern Whigs as well as some southern Democrats . They made their intentions known on December 11 , and by the end of the day , Morehead reported that he had received commitments of support from twenty southern Democrats . During the day 's voting , the five southern Whigs shifted their support from Gentry to Morehead . This shift cost Morehead the support of many northern Whigs who , at the caucus meeting the night of December 11 , declared that Morehead 's election " would ruin the Whig party in the North " , especially if he gained the support of southern Democrats . Rather than further fracture the caucus , Morehead withdrew his name from consideration . Cobb was finally elected on the sixty @-@ third ballot on December 22 .

 Following his congressional tenure , Morehead resumed his law practice and management of his plantations . In 1852 , he was a presidential elector for Winfield Scott , and in 1853 , he served another term in the Kentucky House . By early 1855 , sectional divisions had ripped apart the national Whig Party . In Kentucky , many former Whigs associated with the Know Nothing Party . Morehead was among these ; he claimed that the Know Nothing Party was more " Union " than the Democratic Party . The ex @-@ Whigs hoped to take over the Know Nothing Party and reshape it into a Unionist Whig organization . Accordingly , when the Know Nothing candidate for governor , Judge William Loving , withdrew from the race due to failing health , the influx of ex @-@ Whigs nominated Morehead to replace him for the gubernatorial election of 1855 . Prior to the dissolution of the party , most had expected the Whigs would nominate Morehead at their own party 's convention in April . 
 Though Kentucky had only a small population of immigrants and Catholics , much of Morehead 's campaign oratory was directed against these groups . Most of the state 's immigrant and Catholic population resided in Louisville , and tensions there reached a climax with an anti @-@ foreign riot known as " Bloody Monday " on August 6 , 1855 . Morehead won the election with 69 @,@ 816 votes to 65 @,@ 413 votes for Democrat Beverly L. Clarke . In his inaugural address , Morehead denounced the nullification of the Fugitive Slave Act and despite his campaign rhetoric , proclaimed " perfect equality " for naturalized citizens . 
 Morehead 's term as governor was an active one . He approved the appropriation of funding for the first Kentucky State Fair , which was seen as a vehicle for encouraging improvements in agriculture . He also approved the formation of the Kentucky State Agricultural Society in 1856 . The state geological survey begun under Governor Lazarus W. Powell was completed and published . Internal improvements progressed as well ; railroad mileage in the state increased from 242 miles to 568 miles during Morehead 's term . 
 Kentucky 's school system was expanding rapidly , creating a shortage of qualified teachers in the state ; Morehead responded to this need by proposing a bill for state @-@ supported teacher education program at Transylvania University . The state 's superintendent , John D. Matthews , lobbied for the bill , claiming that a failure to educate teachers in Kentucky would result in Northern teachers infiltrating the state and corrupting children 's minds . The bill passed in 1856 , and Transylvania University made the transition from a private institution to a state @-@ supported university . Money raised through school taxes , previously regarded as revenue by the legislature , was diverted to support of Transylvania . Although the teacher education program enrolled seventy @-@ five students , opposition to the plan developed soon after its passage . Many citizens felt that public school money should not be used to support higher education . Governor Morehead defended the plan , but when the legislature convened two years later , it revoked the university 's funding . 
 The number of prisoners housed in the state penitentiary at Frankfort was also increasing . By 1856 , 237 prisoners were detained in the facility which had only 126 cells . Though state law required solitary confinement at night , the statute was impossible to administer due to the space constraints . Morehead cooperated with the legislature and developed a plan to expand the penitentiary to 252 cells . He also renegotiated the state 's contract with the warden that was more favorable to the state , and allowed the warden to collect income from convict labor . 
 Early in his term , Morehead approved two new bank charters , but he later vetoed several others , beginning with the proposed Bank of Harrodsburg . Many other proposed bank charters died in the General Assembly . The later years of Morehead 's administration were hindered by the financial Panic of 1857 . In December 1857 , he reported state expenditures of $ 21 @,@ 000 for relief of the poor . 
 = = Civil War and later life = = 
 Morehead moved to Louisville in 1859 and formed a law partnership with his nephew , Charles M. Briggs . In February 1861 , he attended the Peace Conference of 1861 that tried to resolve the sectional differences between the states . In May 1861 , he was chosen as a delegate to the Border State Convention , an ultimately futile attempt to avert the Civil War . Morehead refused to sign the final document produced by the convention because he did not agree with all the statements it contained . He was an advocate of Kentucky 's position of neutrality , but was personally sympathetic to the South and was an outspoken critic of the Lincoln administration . He condemned Secretary of State William H. Seward for cutting off trade with the South . 
 On September 19 , 1861 , Morehead , Louisville Courier editor Reuben T. <unk> , and a man named Martin W. Barr were arrested for disloyalty . The three were taken to Indianapolis , Indiana , and the next day , Louisville circuit court judge John Catron issued a writ of habeas corpus for Morehead . On September 24 , the officer who had arrested Morehead told Catron that Secretary of War Simon Cameron had already ordered Morehead taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor . Shortly after this , a grand jury was convened but failed to return any charges against Morehead . 
 Morehead was later transferred to Fort Warren in Boston Harbor . He complained to his captors about the conditions in the prison ; specifically , the difficulty of writing letters when confined with nine other men in a room that measured just ten feet by twenty feet . Petitions for Morehead 's release were delivered to President Lincoln , but Lincoln told Secretary of State Seward that Morehead and those arrested with them would be released " when James Guthrie and James Speed [ friends of Lincoln 's in Kentucky ] think they should be " . Later , Guthrie told Lincoln that Morehead 's arrest had " not been beneficial " to their cause in Kentucky . Morehead was paroled on January 6 , 1862 , on the condition that he swear an oath not to take part in the Confederate insurgence . On March 19 , 1862 , he was unconditionally discharged from his parole . 
 Morehead returned to his home in Louisville , but feared his refusal to take an oath of allegiance to the Constitution would lead to another arrest . In June 1862 , he fled to Canada , then to Europe , and finally to Mexico . Following the war , Morehead returned to the United States and lived on his plantation in Greenville , Mississippi . He died there on December 21 , 1868 and was buried on the grounds . On May 31 , 1879 , he was reburied in the Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort , Kentucky . 
 = Operation Sana = 
 Operation Sana ( Bosnian : Operacija Sana ) was a military offensive undertaken by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine – ARBiH ) in western Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Bosnian War . It was launched from the area of Bihać on 13 September 1995 , against the Army of Republika Srpska ( Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS ) , and involved advances towards Bosanski Petrovac , Sanski Most and Bosanska Krupa . At the same time , the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska – HV ) and the Croatian Defence Council ( Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO ) were engaging the VRS in Operation Maestral 2 further to the southeast . After an initial 70 @-@ kilometre ( 43 mi ) advance , VRS reinforcements managed to stop the ARBiH short of Sanski Most and Novi Grad , and reversed some of the ARBiH 's territorial gains in a counterattack . After a part of the ARBiH 5th Corps was threatened with defeat around the town of Ključ , the ARBiH requested assistance from the HV . 
 The HV and HVO launched Operation Southern Move in response , removing the VRS pressure from Ključ and allowing the 5th Corps , reinforced by the 7th Corps , to resume its advance and capture Sanski Most on 12 October , by which time a comprehensive ceasefire was to come into effect throughout the country . Combat continued for another eight days without significant changes to the frontlines . Fighting did not resume , and the war ended the following month following negotiation and acceptance of the Dayton Agreement . 
 The operation commenced during a NATO bombing campaign against the VRS , codenamed Operation Deliberate Force , which targeted Bosnian Serb air defences , artillery and storage facilities initially in the area of Sarajevo , but also elsewhere in the country . Operation Sana , alongside concurrent HV and HVO offensives , sparked debate among military analysts as to whether the ground assaults or NATO 's airstrikes were more responsible for ending the Bosnian War . Also in question was to what extent the advances of the ARBiH , HVO and HV were assisted by the airstrikes , and conversely , to what extent they hampered the VRS . 
 = = Background = = 
 As the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA ) withdrew from Croatia following the acceptance and start of implementation of the Vance plan , its 55 @,@ 000 officers and soldiers born in Bosnia and Herzegovina were transferred to a new Bosnian Serb army , which was later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska ( Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS ) . This re @-@ organisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992 , ahead of the referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina that took place between 29 February and 1 March 1992 . This declaration would later be cited by the Bosnian Serbs as a pretext for the Bosnian War . Bosnian Serbs began fortifying the capital , Sarajevo , and other areas on 1 March 1992 . On the following day , the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj . In the final days of March , Bosnian Serb forces bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery , resulting in a cross @-@ border operation by the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska – HV ) 108th Brigade . On 4 April 1992 , JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo . There were other examples of the JNA directly supported the VRS , such as during the capture of Zvornik in early April 1992 , when the JNA provided artillery support from Serbia , firing across the Drina River . At the same time , the JNA attempted to defuse the situation and arrange negotiations elsewhere in the country . 
 The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and Herzegovina faced the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine – ARBiH ) and the Croatian Defence Council ( Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO ) , reporting to the Bosniak @-@ dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively , as well as the HV , which occasionally supported HVO operations . In late April , the VRS was able to deploy 200 @,@ 000 troops , hundreds of tanks , armoured personnel carriers ( APCs ) and artillery pieces . The HVO and the Croatian Defence Forces ( Hrvatske obrambene snage – HOS ) could field approximately 25 @,@ 000 soldiers and a handful of heavy weapons , while the ARBiH was largely unprepared with nearly 100 @,@ 000 troops , small arms for less than a half of their number and virtually no heavy weapons . Arming of the various forces was hampered by a United Nations ( UN ) arms embargo introduced in September 1991 . By mid @-@ May 1992 , when those JNA units which had not been transferred to the VRS withdrew from Bosnia and Herzegovina to the newly declared Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the VRS controlled approximately 60 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina . The extent of the control was extended to about 70 percent of the country by the end of the year . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 By 1995 , the ARBiH and the HVO had developed into better @-@ organised forces employing comparably large numbers of artillery pieces and good defensive fortifications . The VRS was not capable of penetrating their defences even where its forces employed sound military tactics , for instance in the Battle of Orašje in May and June 1995 . In August 1995 , after the fall of most of the Croatian Serb @-@ controlled areas of Croatia during Operation Storm , the HV shifted its focus to western Bosnia . The shift was motivated by the desire to create a security zone along the Croatian border , establish Croatia as a regional power and gain favours with the West by forcing an end to the Bosnian War . The government of Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomed the move as it contributed to their goal of securing western Bosnia , as well as the largest Bosnian Serb @-@ held city , Banja Luka . 
 In the final days of August 1995 , NATO launched an air campaign targeting the VRS , codenamed Operation Deliberate Force . It was launched in response to the second Markale massacre of 28 August , which came on the heels of the Srebrenica massacre . Airstrikes began on 30 August , initially targeting VRS air defences , and striking targets near Sarajevo . The campaign was briefly suspended on 1 September and its scope was expanded to target artillery and storage facilities around the city . The bombing resumed on 5 September , and its scope extended to VRS air defences near Banja Luka by 9 September as NATO had nearly exhausted its list of targets near Sarajevo . On 13 September , the Bosnian Serbs accepted NATO 's demand for the establishment of an exclusion zone around Sarajevo and the campaign ceased . 
 As the NATO bombing generally targeted VRS around Sarajevo , western Bosnia remained relatively calm following Operation Storm , except for probing attacks launched by the VRS , HVO or ARBiH near Bihać , Drvar and Glamoč . At the time the HV , HVO and ARBiH were planning a joint offensive in the region . The HV and HVO component of the offensive , codenamed Operation Maestral 2 , was launched on 8 September with the aim of capturing the towns of Jajce , Šipovo and Drvar , while the ARBiH 7th Corps advanced on the right flank of the HV and the HVO towards Donji Vakuf . All four towns had been seized by 14 September , and the 7th Corps began transferring a substantial portion of its troops to the ARBiH 5th Corps in the Bihać area . 
 = = Order of battle = = 
 The 15 @,@ 000 @-@ strong ARBiH 5th Corps , commanded by Divisional General Atif Dudaković , was assigned the primary objectives , the capture of Bosanska Krupa , Bosanski Petrovac , Ključ and Sanski Most . Dudaković divided his eight brigades into two operational groups ( OGs ) . OG ( South ) , which comprised the 501st Mountain , 502nd Mountain , 510th Liberation and 517th Light Brigades , augmented by elements of the 5th Military Police Battalion , was commanded by Dudaković himself . OG ( North ) , consisting of the 503rd Mountain , 505th Mountain , 506th Liberation and 511th Mountain Brigades , was commanded his chief of staff , Brigadier <unk> <unk> . At the commencement of the operation , HV artillery provided fire support to OG South . 
 The 2nd Krajina Corps , commanded by Major General Radivoje Tomanić , and the 30th Infantry Division of the 1st Krajina Corps , commanded by Major General Momir Zec , were the VRS formations in the area . Tomanić , who set up his headquarters in Drvar , was in overall command in western Bosnia . Tomanić and Zec commanded a combined force of approximately 22 @,@ 000 troops . The need to defend against both ARBiH corps and the combined HV and HVO force meant that the VRS had only 8 @,@ 000 troops facing the 5th Corps . They were organised in six infantry or light infantry brigades stationed on the Grabež Plateau and near Bosanska Krupa and Otoka .

 = = = First stage = = = 
 On 13 September , the ARBiH launched its advance , codenamed Sana 95 , from Bihać towards the Sana River . The initial advance was undertaken by OG South and spearheaded by the 502nd Mountain Brigade against VRS positions on the Grabež Plateau south of the town . As its defences yielded to the ground assault supported by HV artillery fire , the VRS started to retreat south towards Bosanski Petrovac , alongside civilians fleeing the area . The ARBiH pursued the retreating VRS , capturing Kulen Vakuf the next day , and Bosanski Petrovac on 15 September . That same day , the ARBiH linked up with the HV approximately 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 miles ) southeast of Bosanski Petrovac . The HV had captured Drvar and reached the <unk> Pass , as part of Operation Maestral 2 . Both forces mistook the other for the VRS , leading to a friendly fire incident . 
 Even though the left flank of the salient created by the ARBiH advance was vulnerable , the VRS could not exploit the opportunity because it had no reserves available in the area . An effort to widen the salient commenced on 15 September , when OG North moved against Bosanska Krupa and Otoka in an assault spearheaded by the 503rd , 505th and 517th brigades . At the same time , OG South regrouped in Bosanski Petrovac in anticipation of reinforcements arriving from the 7th Corps . The regrouping involved the creation of a new formation , OG Centre , consisting of the 502nd , 505th , 506th and 517th brigades , all of which had been previously assigned to the two existing OGs . OG South 's 501st and 510th brigades continued their advance , and captured Ključ on 17 September , having advanced covering 70 kilometres ( 43 miles ) since the start of the operation . On the same day , OG North captured Bosanska Krupa and Otoka , and the 510th Brigade was also transferred to OG Centre . This marked the completion of the first stage of Operation Sana . 
 OG Centre began its advance towards Sanski Most against the 1st Drvar and 1st , 2nd and 3rd Drina infantry brigades , which were remnants of the VRS units which had pulled out of Drvar at the end of Operation Maestral 2 . OG North moved against Novi Grad as well as towards Sanski Most on the left flank of OG Centre , against opposition from the 1st Novigrad and 11th Krupa brigades and the former Drvar garrison . OG South , stripped of all its units except the 501st Brigade , and the 17th Krajina Mountain Brigade which had been transferred from 7th Corps , was tasked with capturing Mrkonjić Grad on the right flank of OG Centre . 
 When the ARBiH approached Novi Grad and Sanski Most on 18 – 19 September , it encountered 14 @,@ 000 additional VRS troops of the Prijedor OG 10 of the 1st Krajina Corps under the command of Colonel Radmilo <unk> , supported by 2 @,@ 000 troops that had arrived from Serbia . The latter included the Serb Volunteer Guard ( Srpska <unk> <unk> – SDG ) , led by Željko Ražnatović Arkan , and Serbia 's State Security Service Red Berets . The 2nd Corps re @-@ assembled behind the Prijedor OG 10 and Serbian troops . As the ARBiH approached the two towns , the HV launched Operation Una on 18 September , which involved attempts to cross the Una River at several points near Bosanska Dubica , Bosanska Kostajnica and Novi Grad opposite Dvor . The HV managed to establish several small bridgeheads on the right bank of the river , but the operation was called off after two days of fighting due to high casualties brought on by poor planning . 
 = = = VRS counteroffensive = = = 
 On 20 – 22 September , the VRS 5th Kozara and 6th <unk> brigades managed to push OG Centre back approximately six kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 miles ) , while parts of OG North had to withdraw from some areas they had captured . OG North was able to continue its advance near Novi Grad and towards Ljubija against strong resistance . On 22 September , Colonel General Ratko Mladić cut short his medical treatment in Belgrade to return to Banja Luka and control the VRS more directly . The meeting between the top VRS commanders and Mladić produced a request for general mobilisation , establishment of corps @-@ level drumhead court @-@ <unk> , and a request for the SDG to leave the area — despite the fact that they had been invited by the Republika Srpska Ministry of the Interior and had been granted authority by Radovan Karadžić , the president of Republika Srpska . Finally , a VRS counteroffensive was ordered to regain the lost territory . 
 The counteroffensive commenced on the night of 23 / 24 September , with the VRS 65th Protection Regiment , 16th Krajina and 43rd Motorised brigades and SDG troops attacking OG North . Fighting lasted for six days and was personally overseen by Mladić . VRS forces pushed the ARBiH back to Bosanska Krupa and Otoka , but the advance had to be stopped to divert forces to defend Mrkonjić Grad . By 1 October , OG South had pushed the VRS 17th Ključ Brigade back to within three kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 miles ) of Mrkonjić Grad . The 16th Motorised Brigade was redeployed from Bosanska Krupa to Mrkonjić Grad , under the command of Colonel Milenko Lazić 's OG 2 of the 30th Division . OG 2 , supported by the SDG , the Red Berets , a Bosnian Serb special police brigade , and at least one battalion of the 1st Armoured Brigade , started to drive OG South back north towards Ključ . OG South had only received one additional independent battalion from the 7th Corps as reinforcement . The reinforced VRS 5th Kozara and 6th <unk> infantry brigades ( organised as the Prijedor OG ) moved south from Sanski Most towards Ključ to complete a pincer movement aimed at destroying OG South . The counterattack had gained momentum by 3 October , and the VRS advanced within one kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 miles ) of Ključ , covering seventeen kilometres ( 11 miles ) in three days . The 16th Motorised Brigade was again redeployed , this time to reinforce VRS positions at Mount Ozren near Doboj . The remaining VRS forces , bolstered by the addition of the 2nd Reconnaissance Sabotage Detachment of the 2nd Corps , continued their attacks against Ključ , but had made only small advances by 8 – 9 October , as OG South had finally received more reinforcements from the 7th Corps , specifically the 707th and 717th brigades . Since Ključ was still in jeopardy , the ARBiH requested HV and HVO assistance . 
 = = = Capture of Sanski Most = = = 
 The HV and HVO agreed to assist the ARBiH , and launched Operation Southern Move to relieve the situation in Ključ . In this operation , the HV and the HVO fielded 11 @,@ 000 – 12 @,@ 000 troops who captured Mrkonjić Grad from three VRS brigades , thus relieving the pressure on the ARBiH in Ključ . The HV and the HVO then captured the Bočac Hydroelectric Power Station , the last remaining electrical power source available to the Bosnian Serbs in western Bosnia and Herzegovina . On 11 October , the HV and HVO reached a point on Mount Manjača , 25 kilometres ( 16 miles ) south of Banja Luka . 
 By 9 October , the ARBiH 5th Corps had received approximately 10 @,@ 000 troops as reinforcements , including the ARBiH Guards Brigade , the 17th Krajina Mountain , 717th Mountain , <unk> Light , and <unk> Mountain brigades , and the 7th Reconnaissance @-@ Sabotage Battalion . The Guards Brigade was used to reinforce OG Centre , which also received the 501st Brigade from OG South , while the latter now comprised five brigades previously subordinated to the 7th Corps . 
 That day , the 5th Corps launched a fresh attack towards Sanski Most , employing OGs Centre and South to capture the town . The assault , spearheaded by the 502nd and 510th brigades , penetrated VRS defences manned by the 15th Bihać and 17th Ključ Brigades , forcing <unk> to withdraw his troops to the town itself to avoid encirclement . On 10 October , elements of the VRS 43rd Motorised and 11th Dubica brigades launched an unsuccessful attempt to halt the ARBiH advance on the outskirts of Sanski Most . The 502nd Brigade , the Guards Brigade and the 5th Military Police Battalion subsequently captured the town . 
 Despite the fact that a ceasefire was scheduled to come into force throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina on 12 October , OG Centre continued its advance northeast of Sanski Most , engaging the bulk of the VRS 43rd Motorised Brigade in a series of clashes . This fighting resulted in little change to the territory held by either side by 20 October , when fighting died down . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Operation Sana , as well as Operation Maestral 2 , were crucial in applying pressure on the VRS in the final weeks of the Bosnian War . A Central Intelligence Agency analysis comparing the effect that Operation Deliberate Force and Operations Sana and Maestral 2 had on the VRS noted that the NATO campaign did not degrade the combat capability of the VRS as much as was initially assumed , because the airstrikes were never primarily directed at field @-@ deployed units , rather they targeted the command and control infrastructure of the Bosnian Serb military . The analysis concluded that , while NATO degraded VRS capabilities , the final offensives by the HV , HVO and the ARBiH had inflicted the most damage . It further noted that those offensives , rather than the NATO bombing , were responsible for bringing the Bosnian Serbs to the negotiating table and ending the war . Author Robert C. Owen argues that the HV , HVO and ARBiH would not have advanced as rapidly as they did had NATO not intervened and hampered VRS defenses , denying it long @-@ range communications . 
 Operation Sana and Operation Southern Move established the 51 % – 49 % distribution of territory controlled by the ARBiH and HVO on the one hand and the VRS on the other , as envisaged in plans put forward by the Contact Group . The ARBiH , HVO and HV ultimately consented to the maintenance of the ceasefire of 12 October . According to British historian Marko Attila Hoare , their acquiescence was secured following massive diplomatic pressure from the West , and the alleged threat of US airstrikes against the ARBiH if it breached the ceasefire . The Bosnian War ended with the acceptance of the Dayton Agreement by all sides in November 1995 . 
 The offensive resulted in 178 dead , 588 wounded and 41 captured ARBiH troops . Bosnian Serb losses were 900 killed and more than 1 @,@ 000 wounded . In September and October , 6 @,@ 500 Bosniak and Croat civilians living in the area of Banja Luka or Prijedor were expelled from their homes by Bosnian Serb forces . At the same time , approximately 2 @,@ 000 non @-@ Serb civilians went missing in the area , and presumed detained in labour camps or killed . Changes of control of territory also allowed access to two mass graves near Sanski Most , believed to contain the bodies of 300 civilians killed by Bosnian Serb forces in April 1992 . 
 Operation Sana , along with the near @-@ concurrent Operation Maestral 2 , created a large number of refugees from the areas previously controlled by the VRS . Bosnian Serb sources document approximately 40 @,@ 000 refugees in September 1995 , encompassing the entire contemporary Bosnian Serb populations of the towns of Jajce , Šipovo , Mrkonjić Grad and Donji Vakuf having fled or been evacuated . At the time , the UN spokesman in Sarajevo estimated the number of refugees at 20 @,@ 000 . Fighting in October caused another 30 @,@ 000 – 40 @,@ 000 refugees to flee from Sanski Most and another 10 @,@ 000 from areas in and around Mrkonjić Grad .

 Aaron Michael Miller ( born August 11 , 1971 ) is a retired American professional ice hockey defenseman . Over the course of his fourteen @-@ year career in the National Hockey League , Miller played for four teams : the Quebec Nordiques , who eventually relocated and became the Colorado Avalanche , the Los Angeles Kings , and the Vancouver Canucks . In 2002 , he was selected as a member of United States hockey team at the 2002 Winter Olympics , where he won a silver medal . Prior to making his professional debut , Miller earned a degree in business from the University of Vermont .

 Miller was born and raised in Buffalo , New York . After playing forward at St. Francis High School and the Niagara <unk> in Buffalo , Miller was given a scholarship to the University of Vermont . Prior to attending the university , he was drafted 88th overall by the New York Rangers in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft . Miller was named team captain at the start of the 1992 @-@ 93 season . He scored four goals and 13 assists in 30 games over the year , and was named to both the ECAC First All @-@ Star Team and the NCAA East Second All @-@ American Team . After four years at Vermont , he graduated with a degree in business .

 = = = Quebec Nordiques and Colorado Avalanche = = = 
 Though he was drafted by the Rangers in 1989 , Miller opted to go to university and complete his degree . It was while he was at university that Miller was traded by the Rangers . On January 17 , 1991 , he was sent to the Quebec Nordiques along with the Rangers 5th round draft choice ( Bill Lindsay ) in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft for Joe <unk> . 
 After graduating from university , Miller made his professional debut in 1993 for the Nordiques minor league affiliate , the Cornwall Aces of the American Hockey League . On January 15 , 1994 he made his NHL debut in Quebec against the Washington Capitals . Miller 's first professional season ended with one NHL game , and 64 AHL games , where he scored four goals and 10 assists . The next season he appeared in nine games for the Nordiques , earning three assists . Miller also played 76 games for the Aces , finishing with totals of four goals and 22 points . 
 On June 21 , 1995 , the Quebec Nordiques transferred to Denver and became the Colorado Avalanche . Miller joined the team in Colorado , and split the 1995 – 96 season between Colorado and Cornwall . In 62 games with Cornwall , he had four goals and 23 assists , while going <unk> in five games with the Avalanche . Because he didn 't appear in enough games , Miller was not considered as part of the Stanley Cup winning Avalanche team . 
 The 1996 – 97 season was Miller 's first full season in the NHL . In a game against the Chicago Blackhawks on October 11 , 1996 , Miller scored his first NHL goal . He finished with five goals and 17 points while appearing in 56 games for the Avalanche , and his plus @-@ minus was a + 15 , the best in the NHL for rookie players . It also marked the NHL playoff debut for Miller , who had a goal and two assists in 17 playoff games . The following season , he had four points in 55 games for the Avalanche , while going pointless in seven playoff games . Miller had his most productive season in 1998 – 99 . After scoring a career @-@ high 18 points in 76 games , Miller participated in 19 playoff games , with a career best five assists and six points . He would only play in 53 games the next season , but did suit up for every playoff game , scoring a goal and an assist in 17 games . 
 After 56 games with the Avalanche during the 2000 – 01 season , where he had 13 points , Miller was traded for the second time in his career . On February 21 , 2001 Miller was sent to the Los Angeles Kings by the Colorado Avalanche with Adam Deadmarsh , a player later to be named ( Jared <unk> , who would be traded on March 22 , 2001 ) and Colorado 's 1st round choices in the 2001 ( Dave Steckel ) and 2003 ( Brian Boyle ) Entry Drafts for Rob Blake and Steven Reinprecht . Miller was not originally meant to be traded , but the Kings insisted he be part of the deal . 
 = = = Los Angeles Kings and Vancouver Canucks = = = 
 Miller would finish the 2000 – 01 season with the Kings . In the final 13 games of the regular season , he had five assists , finishing with a career @-@ best 14 assists and matching his career high of 18 points in one season . He contributed an assist in 13 playoff games as the Kings played the Avalanche , Miller 's former team , who defeated Los Angeles as they went on to win the Stanley Cup for the second time . 
 In his first full season with the Kings , Miller played in 74 games for the team , scoring five goals and adding 12 assists during the 2001 – 02 season . At the conclusion of the regular season , Miller was named the winner of several Kings team awards : best defenseman , best defensive player and the teams unsung hero . During the playoffs , he went pointless while playing in all seven of the Kings ' games . Abdominal surgery and a broken foot limited Miller to 49 games with the Kings the next season , recording one goal and five assists for six points . 
 In a game against the Atlanta Thrashers on December 10 , 2003 , Miller injured his neck . It would lead him to miss most of the 2003 – 04 season , appearing in 35 games and scoring one goal and two assists . The 2004 – 05 NHL lockout resulted in a cancelled 2004 – 05 season . Unlike many other players , Miller did not play in a different league . He returned to play for the 2005 – 06 season and earned eight assists in 56 games .

 = Brownsea Castle = 
 Brownsea Castle , also known historically as <unk> Castle , was originally a Device Fort constructed by Henry VIII between 1545 and 1547 to protect Poole Harbour in Dorset , England , from the threat of French attack . Located on Brownsea Island , it comprised a stone blockhouse with a hexagonal gun platform . It was garrisoned by the local town with six soldiers and armed with eight artillery pieces . The castle remained in use after the original invasion scare had passed and was occupied by Parliament during the English Civil War of the 1640s . By the end of the century , however , it had fallen into disuse . 
 In 1726 the castle was converted into a private residence by William Benson , despite complaints from the town of Poole . Benson and the subsequent owners extended the original blockhouse to form a country house , landscaping the surrounding island to create ornamental gardens and lakes . The 19th century saw continued building work by the castle 's occupants , including the entrepreneur Colonel William Waugh , who erected various Jacobethan @-@ styled extensions . A serious fire in 1896 gutted the castle , which was restored by Major Kenneth Robert Balfour . The wealthy stockbroker Charles Van Raalte led a lavish lifestyle at Brownsea at the start of the 20th century , using it to house his collection of antique musical instruments . 
 Brownsea Castle was purchased by Mary Bonham @-@ Christie in 1927 . She allowed the property to fall into disrepair and by the time of her death in 1961 it was in a very poor condition . It was then purchased by the National Trust and leased to the John Lewis Partnership , who restored it over many years . In the 21st century it is still used by the Partnership as a corporate hotel for their employees and former staff . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 16th century = = = 
 Brownsea Castle was built as a consequence of international tensions between England , France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII . Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities , only taking a small role in building and maintaining fortifications , and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another , maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely . Modest defences , based around simple blockhouses and towers , existed in the south @-@ west and along the Sussex coast , with a few more impressive works in the north of England , but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale . 
 In 1533 , Henry then broke with Pope Paul III in order to annul the long @-@ standing marriage to his wife , Catherine of Aragon and remarry . This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538 , and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England . Henry responded in 1539 by ordering , through an instruction called a " device " , the construction of fortifications along the most vulnerable parts of the coast . The immediate threat passed , but resurfaced in 1544 , with France threatening an invasion across the Channel , backed by her allies in Scotland . Henry therefore issued another device in 1544 to further improve the country 's defences , particularly along the south coast . 
 The castle was built on the south @-@ east corner of Brownsea Island between 1545 and 1547 to protect the entrance of the busy Poole Harbour . The island belonged to the Crown , having been confiscated from Cerne Abbey during the Dissolution of the Monasteries a few years before . It was a conservative design , being a one @-@ storey , square blockhouse , reported in 1552 to be 44 feet ( 13 m ) across , able to support guns on its roof and sub @-@ divided into three rooms ; the blockhouse was originally intended to have been two storeys in height , but this was not achieved . The blockhouse was surrounded on the seaward side by a hexagonal gun platform , with a moat around the other three sides and a 24 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) drawbridge on the south @-@ west side to allow access . 
 The construction was paid for by a combination of the Crown and the local town of Poole , who took on the responsibility of garrisoning and maintaining it ; in the early years of Elizabeth 's reign , the normal garrison was described as comprising six men and was equipped with eight artillery pieces . 
 Additional work on the gun platform costing £ 56 was carried out in 1548 , and further work was carried out in 1552 to develop the castle 's defences , at the cost to Poole of £ 133 . The castle needed regular investment : 101 piles were driven in during 1551 , probably to combat coastal erosion , and in 1561 the town petitioned the Crown for help with further repairs and the provision of new cannons . Another petition was made for similar help in 1571 , resulting in repairs two years later costing £ 520 and requiring 4 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 3 @,@ 900 long tons ; 4 @,@ 400 short tons ) of stone . More work followed in 1585 , including building an additional 4 @-@ foot @-@ high ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) wall around the castle . 
 In 1576 , Elizabeth I granted the castles of Brownsea and Corfe for life to Sir Christopher Hatton , making him the Admiral of Purbeck . Hatton argued with the town of Poole , claiming that he had the right to search and inspect ships going into Poole Harbour , as well as the rights to the revenues from the local ferry service ; he lost his legal case around the ferrying rights in 1581 . In 1589 , the Bountiful Gift refused to pull in for inspection , arguing that it had had a valid pass to leave , and Brownsea Castle fired on the vessel , killing two of the crew . The castle 's captain , Walter Partridge , was tried and conflicted of manslaughter , but ultimately pardoned . The rest of the island , but not the castle , was leased out to various landowners over the next few years . 
 = = = 17th - 18th centuries = = = 
 The castle was garrisoned throughout most of the 17th century . In the civil war of the 1640s between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament , the castle was held for Parliament , under the control of the Governor of Poole . The castle was refortified and in 1644 , Parliament ordered that four pieces of artillery and four chests of muskets be sent to the castle , which by 1646 had a garrison of 20 men . During the Interregnum , the wealthy merchant Sir Robert Clayton bought the surrounding island . Clayton probably did not live in the castle , however , and it fell into disrepair ; by the end of the century the town of Poole refused to garrison the decaying defences . 
 The amateur architect William Benson bought the island from Clayton 's heirs in 1726 for £ 300 . Benson set about converting the castle into a private residence , amid complaints from the authorities in Poole . The town took the matter to the Attorney General , where they argued that Benson had not bought the rights to the castle itself , only the island , and that the castle was a national fortification , originally built by Henry VIII and owned by Poole . Benson argued that the building had not originally been a castle but rather a lodging house ; it had not been built by Henry and therefore the Crown had no particular rights over it - rather , the previous owners of the island had simply allowed the town and the government to place artillery there . The matter was eventually dropped and Benson demolished the external fortifications , created a Great Hall and planted trees and rare plants around the island . 
 The castle was sold to a Mr Chamberlayne and then onto Sir Gerard Sturt in 1762 and Gerard 's cousin , Sir Humphrey Sturt , in 1765 . Humphrey extended the castle around its 16th century core to form a Palladian styled , four @-@ storey tower with battlements , with new wings stretching away on three sides . He also built a walled courtyard with hot houses beside the castle , and landscaped the island with two lakes and a large number of fir trees at a cost of £ 50 @,@ 000 . His son , Charles Sturt , made the castle his primary home , although he was often living elsewhere as a result of his involvement in the Napoleonic Wars . 
 = = = 19th - 21st centuries = = = 
 Charles Sturt 's son , also called Charles , inherited the property and sold it to Sir Charles Chad in 1817 . Chad invested significantly in the castle and Prince George visited in 1818 , arriving to a salute from the castle guns . The diplomat Sir Augustus Foster acquired the castle in 1840 on his retirement ; he committed suicide at the castle 1848 , having been in what his inquest termed a state of temporary insanity following a " disease of the heart and lungs " . 
 A retired Indian Amy officer , Colonel William Waugh , bought the island in 1852 , hoping to turn it into a profitable pottery works . He carried out restoration work on the castle and built up a new Jacobethan @-@ styled range around the south and east sides of the castle . Waugh also constructed the crenelated gatehouse and clocktower at the entrance to the courtyard , and the Jacobethan @-@ styled family pier by the sea below the castle . The commercial venture was a failure and Waugh fled his creditors to Spain in 1857 . 
 After a period of ownership by a Mr Faulkner , who continued the pottery scheme , the property was eventually resold in 1873 to the politician and lawyer George Cavendish @-@ Bentinck for £ 30 @,@ 000 , who furnished the castle with an extensive collection of Italian Renaissance sculpture . Cavendish @-@ Bentinck closed the pottery works and gave the island as a family home to his son , William , paying for the castle to be extensively renovated ; William and his wife Ruth moved into it in 1888 . Cavendish @-@ Bentinck died in 1891 with extensive debts , forcing William to sell the castle and island to Major Kenneth Robert Balfour . 
 The castle caught fire on 26 January 1896 and the interiors were gutted by the blaze . Balfour rebuilt the property with the services of the architect Philip Brown , softening the more complex aspects of the castle 's design . Balfour 's wife , Margaret Anne , fell ill and he decided to sell the island in 1901 to the stockbroker Charles van Raalte . 
 Van Raalte maintained a lavish lifestyle at the castle , which by now had 38 bedrooms , holding grand house @-@ parties during the summer months , complete with servants and a part @-@ time musical band and assembling a rare collection of around 250 historical musical instruments from Europe , Asia and Africa at the castle . Charles died in 1908 but his wife Florence stayed until 1925 . On Florence 's death in 1927 the castle was sold to Sir Arthur Wheeler , who promptly decided to auction off the remaining contents with the intent of demolishing the property . The sale , which included some of Van Raalte 's collection of instruments , paintings and a 5 @,@ 000 book library , produced £ 22 @,@ 300 . 
 The castle was not demolished as planned and instead was purchased by Mary Bonham @-@ Christie for £ 125 @,@ 000 later that year . She decided to live in a nearby house rather than the castle itself , allowing the island to return to nature and the castle to fall into disrepair . By the time of Bonham @-@ Christie 's death in 1961 the roof had partially collapsed and a tree was growing up through the centre of the building . Facing large death duties , Bonham @-@ Christie 's grandson put the island up for sale , before agreeing to donate it to the state in lieu of taxes . 
 The National Trust took on ownership of the castle and island in 1962 but considered the castle to be of " little antiquity or architectural interest " . The John Lewis Partnership leased the castle from the Trust for use as a corporate hotel by their employees , gradually restoring the buildings in stages and they remain the current tenants . Some of the 19th century interior features still survive , including wood panelling and ornamental ceilings , with some carved stone fireplaces from Venice ; the castle also has four cannons , probably dating from the 17th or early 18th century . The castle is protected under UK law as a Grade II listed building . 
 = Iran – Contra affair = 
 The Iran – Contra affair ( Persian : <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> , Spanish : caso <unk> @-@ Contra ) , also referred to as <unk> , <unk> or the Iran – Contra scandal , was a political scandal in the United States that occurred during the second term of the Reagan Administration . Senior administration officials secretly facilitated the sale of arms to Iran , which was the subject of an arms embargo . They hoped thereby to secure the release of several U.S. hostages and to fund the Contras in Nicaragua . Under the Boland Amendment , further funding of the Contras by the government had been prohibited by Congress . 
 The scandal began as an operation to free the seven American hostages being held in Lebanon by Hezbollah , a paramilitary group with Iranian ties connected to the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution . It was planned that Israel would ship weapons to Iran , and then the United States would resupply Israel and receive the Israeli payment . The Iranian recipients promised to do everything in their power to achieve the release of the U.S. hostages . Large modifications to the plan were devised by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the National Security Council in late 1985 , in which a portion of the proceeds from the weapon sales was diverted to fund anti @-@ Sandinista and anti @-@ communist rebels , or Contras , in Nicaragua . 
 While President Ronald Reagan was a supporter of the Contra cause , the evidence is disputed as to whether he authorized the diversion of the money raised by the Iranian arms sales to the Contras . Handwritten notes taken by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on December 7 , 1985 , indicate that Reagan was aware of potential hostage transfers with Iran , as well as the sale of Hawk and TOW missiles to " moderate elements " within that country . Weinberger wrote that Reagan said " he could answer to charges of illegality but couldn 't answer to the charge that ' big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to free the hostages ' " . After the weapon sales were revealed in November 1986 , Reagan appeared on national television and stated that the weapons transfers had indeed occurred , but that the United States did not trade arms for hostages . The investigation was impeded when large volumes of documents relating to the scandal were destroyed or withheld from investigators by Reagan administration officials . On March 4 , 1987 , Reagan returned to the airwaves in a nationally televised address , taking full responsibility for any actions that he was unaware of , and admitting that " what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated , in its implementation , into trading arms for hostages " . 
 Several investigations ensued , including those by the U.S. Congress and the three @-@ person , Reagan @-@ appointed Tower Commission . Neither found any evidence that President Reagan himself knew of the extent of the multiple programs . Ultimately the sale of weapons to Iran was not deemed a criminal offense but charges were brought against five individuals for their support of the Contras . Those charges , however , were later dropped because the administration refused to declassify certain documents . The indicted conspirators faced various lesser charges instead . In the end , fourteen administration officials were indicted , including then @-@ Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger . Eleven convictions resulted , some of which were vacated on appeal . The rest of those indicted or convicted were all pardoned in the final days of the presidency of George H. W. Bush , who had been vice @-@ president at the time of the affair .

 Contra militants based in Honduras waged a guerrilla war to topple the Sandinista National Liberation Front ( <unk> ) revolutionary government of Nicaragua . Direct U.S. funding of the Contras insurgency was made illegal through the Boland Amendment , the name given to three U.S. legislative amendments between 1982 and 1984 aimed at limiting U.S. government assistance to the Contra 's militants . Funding ran out for the Contras by July 1984 and in October a total ban was placed in effect . In violation of the Boland Amendment , senior officials of the Reagan administration continued to secretly arm and train the Contras and provide arms to Iran , an operation they called " the Enterprise " . Ironically , military aid to the Contras was reinstated with Congressional consent in October 1986 , a month before the scandal broke . 
 = = Arms sales to Iran = = 
 Michael <unk> , a consultant of National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane , requested assistance from Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres for help in the sale of arms to Iran . Having been designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism since January 1984 , Iran was in the midst of the Iran – Iraq War and could find few Western nations willing to supply it with weapons . The idea behind the plan was for Israel to ship weapons through an intermediary ( identified as Manucher Ghorbanifar ) to the Islamic republic as a way of aiding a supposedly moderate , politically influential faction within the regime of Ayatollah Khomeini who was believed to be seeking a rapprochement with the United States ; after the transaction , the United States would reimburse Israel with the same weapons , while receiving monetary benefits . The Israeli government required that the sale of arms meet high level approval from the United States government , and when McFarlane convinced them that the U.S. government approved the sale , Israel obliged by agreeing to sell the arms . 
 In 1985 , President Reagan entered Bethesda Naval Hospital for colon cancer surgery . While the President was recovering in the hospital , McFarlane met with him and told him that representatives from Israel had contacted the National Security Agency to pass on confidential information from what Reagan later described as the " moderate " Iranian faction opposed to the Ayatollah 's hardline anti @-@ American policies . According to Reagan , these Iranians sought to establish a quiet relationship with the United States , before establishing formal relationships upon the death of the aging Ayatollah . In Reagan 's account , McFarlane told Reagan that the Iranians , to demonstrate their seriousness , offered to persuade the Hezbollah militants to release the seven U.S. hostages . McFarlane met with the Israeli intermediaries ; Reagan claimed that he allowed this because he believed that establishing relations with a strategically located country , and preventing the Soviet Union from doing the same , was a beneficial move . Although Reagan claims that the arms sales were to a " moderate " faction of Iranians , the Walsh Iran / Contra Report states that the arms sales were " to Iran " itself , which was under the control of the Ayatollah . 
 Following the Israeli – U.S. meeting , Israel requested permission from the United States to sell a small number of BGM @-@ 71 TOW antitank missiles to Iran , claiming that this would aid the " moderate " Iranian faction , by demonstrating that the group actually had high @-@ level connections to the U.S. government . Reagan initially rejected the plan , until Israel sent information to the United States showing that the " moderate " Iranians were opposed to terrorism and had fought against it . Now having a reason to trust the " moderates " , Reagan approved the transaction , which was meant to be between Israel and the " moderates " in Iran , with the United States reimbursing Israel . In his 1990 autobiography An American Life , Reagan claimed that he was deeply committed to securing the release of the hostages ; it was this compassion that supposedly motivated his support for the arms initiatives . The president requested that the " moderate " Iranians do everything in their capability to free the hostages held by Hezbollah . 
 The following arms were supplied to Iran : 
 August 20 , 1985 – 96 TOW anti @-@ tank missiles 
 September 14 , 1985 – 408 more TOWs 
 November 24 , 1985 – 18 Hawk anti @-@ aircraft missiles 
 February 17 , 1986 – 500 TOWs 
 February 27 , 1986 – 500 TOWs 
 May 24 , 1986 – 508 TOWs , 240 Hawk spare parts 
 August 4 , 1986 – More Hawk spares 
 October 28 , 1986 – 500 TOWs

 On August 20 , 1985 , Israel sent 100 American @-@ made TOW missiles to Iran through an arms dealer named Manucher Ghorbanifar . Subsequently , on September 14 , 1985 , 408 more TOW missiles were delivered . On September 15 , 1985 , following the second delivery , Reverend Benjamin Weir was released by his captors , the Islamic Jihad Organization . 
 = = = Modifications in plans = = = 
 Robert McFarlane resigned on December 4 , 1985 , citing that he wanted to spend more time with his family . He was replaced by Admiral John Poindexter . 
 Two days later , Reagan met with his advisors at the White House , where a new plan was introduced . This one called for a slight change in the arms transactions : instead of the weapons going to the " moderate " Iranian group , they would go to " moderate " Iranian army leaders . As the weapons were delivered from Israel by air , the hostages held by Hezbollah would be released . Israel would continue to be reimbursed by the United States for the weapons . Though staunchly opposed by Secretary of State George Shultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , the plan was authorized by Reagan , who stated that , " We were not trading arms for hostages , nor were we negotiating with terrorists " . Now retired National Security Advisor McFarlane flew to London to meet with Israelis and Ghorbanifar in an attempt to persuade the Iranian to use his influence to release the hostages before any arms transactions occurred ; this plan was rejected by Ghorbanifar . 
 On the day of McFarlane 's resignation , Oliver North , a military aide to the United States National Security Council ( NSC ) , proposed a new plan for selling arms to Iran , which included two major adjustments : instead of selling arms through Israel , the sale was to be direct , and a portion of the proceeds would go to Contras , or Nicaraguan paramilitary fighters waging guerrilla warfare against the democratically @-@ elected Sandinista government , at a markup . North proposed a $ 15 million markup , while contracted arms broker Ghorbanifar added a 41 % markup of his own . Other members of the NSC were in favor of North 's plan ; with large support , Poindexter authorized it without notifying President Reagan , and it went into effect . At first , the Iranians refused to buy the arms at the inflated price because of the excessive markup imposed by North and Ghorbanifar . They eventually relented , and in February 1986 , 1 @,@ 000 TOW missiles were shipped to the country . From May to November 1986 , there were additional shipments of miscellaneous weapons and parts . 
 Both the sale of weapons to Iran , and the funding of the Contras , attempted to circumvent not only stated administration policy , but also the Boland Amendment . Administration officials argued that regardless of the Congress restricting the funds for the Contras , or any affair , the President ( or in this case the administration ) could carry on by seeking alternative means of funding such as private entities and foreign governments . Funding from one foreign country , Brunei , was botched when North 's secretary , Fawn Hall , transposed the numbers of North 's Swiss bank account number . A Swiss businessman , suddenly $ 10 million richer , alerted the authorities of the mistake . The money was eventually returned to the Sultan of Brunei , with interest . 
 On January 7 , 1986 , John Poindexter proposed to the president a modification of the approved plan : instead of negotiating with the " moderate " Iranian political group , the United States would negotiate with " moderate " members of the Iranian government . Poindexter told Reagan that Ghorbanifar had important connections within the Iranian government , so with the hope of the release of the hostages , Reagan approved this plan as well . Throughout February 1986 , weapons were shipped directly to Iran by the United States ( as part of Oliver North 's plan , without the knowledge of President Reagan ) and none of the hostages were released . Retired National Security Advisor McFarlane conducted another international voyage , this one to Tehran ; bringing with him a gift of a bible having a handwritten inscription by Ronald Reagan ; and , according to George Cave a cake baked in the shape of a key . Howard <unk> described the cake as a joke between North and Ghorbanifar . He met directly with the " moderate " Iranian political group that sought to establish <unk> relations in an attempt to free the four remaining hostages . This meeting also failed . The members requested concessions such as Israel 's withdrawal from the Golan Heights , which the United States rejected . 
 = = = Subsequent dealings = = = 
 In late July 1986 , Hezbollah released another hostage , Father Lawrence <unk> , former head of Catholic Relief Services in Lebanon . Following this , William Casey , head of the CIA , requested that the United States authorize sending a shipment of small missile parts to Iranian military forces as a way of expressing gratitude . Casey also justified this request by stating that the contact in the Iranian government might otherwise lose face or be executed , and hostages might be killed . Reagan authorized the shipment to ensure that those potential events would not occur . 
 In September and October 1986 three more Americans — Frank Reed , Joseph <unk> , and Edward Tracy — were abducted in Lebanon by a separate terrorist group , who referred to them simply as " G.I. Joe , " after the popular American toy . The reasons for their abduction are unknown , although it is speculated that they were kidnapped to replace the freed Americans . One more original hostage , David Jacobsen , was later released . The captors promised to release the remaining two , but the release never happened . 
 = = Discovery and scandal = = 
 After a leak by Mehdi Hashemi , a senior official in the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution , the Lebanese magazine Ash @-@ <unk> exposed the arrangement on November 3 , 1986 . This was the first public reporting of the weapons @-@ for @-@ hostages deal . The operation was discovered only after an airlift of guns ( Corporate Air Services <unk> ) was downed over Nicaragua . Eugene <unk> , who was captured by Nicaraguan authorities after surviving the plane crash , initially alleged in a press conference on Nicaraguan soil that two of his coworkers , Max Gomez and Ramon Medina , worked for the Central Intelligence Agency . He later said he did not know whether they did or not . The Iranian government confirmed the Ash @-@ <unk> story , and ten days after the story was first published , President Reagan appeared on national television from the Oval Office on November 13 , stating : 
 My purpose was ... to send a signal that the United States was prepared to replace the animosity between [ the U.S. and Iran ] with a new relationship ... At the same time we undertook this initiative , we made clear that Iran must oppose all forms of international terrorism as a condition of progress in our relationship . The most significant step which Iran could take , we indicated , would be to use its influence in Lebanon to secure the release of all hostages held there . 
 The scandal was compounded when Oliver North destroyed or hid pertinent documents between November 21 and November 25 , 1986 . During North 's trial in 1989 , his secretary , Fawn Hall , testified extensively about helping North alter , shred , and remove official United States National Security Council ( NSC ) documents from the White House . According to the New York Times , enough documents were put into a government shredder to jam it . North 's explanation for destroying some documents was to protect the lives of individuals involved in Iran and Contra operations . It was not until 1993 , years after the trial , that North 's notebooks were made public , and only after the National Security Archive and Public Citizen sued the Office of the Independent Counsel under the Freedom of Information Act . 
 During the trial , North testified that on November 21 , 22 , or 24 , he witnessed Poindexter destroy what may have been the only signed copy of a presidential covert @-@ action finding that sought to authorize CIA participation in the November 1985 Hawk missile shipment to Iran . U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese admitted on November 25 that profits from weapons sales to Iran were made available to assist the Contra rebels in Nicaragua . On the same day , John Poindexter resigned , and President Reagan fired Oliver North . Poindexter was replaced by Frank Carlucci on December 2 , 1986 . 
 In his exposé Veil : The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981 – 1987 , journalist Bob Woodward chronicles the role of the CIA in facilitating the transfer of funds from the Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contras spearheaded by Oliver North . According to Woodward , then Director of the CIA , William J. Casey , admitted to him February 1987 that he was aware of the diversion of funds to the contras . The controversial admission occurred while Casey was hospitalized for a stroke , and , according to his wife , was unable to communicate . On May 6 , 1987 , William Casey died the day after Congress began its public hearings on Iran – Contra . Independent Counsel , Lawrence Walsh later wrote : " Independent Counsel obtained no documentary evidence showing Casey knew about or approved the diversion . The only direct testimony linking Casey to early knowledge of the diversion came from [ Oliver ] North . " 
 = = Tower Commission = = 
 On November 25 , 1986 , President Reagan announced the creation of a Special Review Board to look into the matter ; the following day , he appointed former Senator John Tower , former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie , and former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to serve as members . This Presidential Commission took effect on December 1 and became known as the Tower Commission . The main objectives of the commission were to inquire into " the circumstances surrounding the Iran @-@ Contra matter , other case studies that might reveal strengths and weaknesses in the operation of the National Security Council system under stress , and the manner in which that system has served eight different presidents since its inception in 1947 " . The Tower Commission was the first presidential commission to review and evaluate the National Security Council . 
 President Reagan appeared before the Tower Commission on December 2 , 1986 , to answer questions regarding his involvement in the affair . When asked about his role in authorizing the arms deals , he first stated that he had ; later , he appeared to contradict himself by stating that he had no recollection of doing so . In his 1990 autobiography , An American Life , Reagan acknowledges authorizing the shipments to Israel . 
 The report published by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on February 26 , 1987 . The Commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme , including Reagan , and two of the arms trade middlemen : Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi . The 200 @-@ page report was the most comprehensive of any released , criticizing the actions of Oliver North , John Poindexter , Caspar Weinberger , and others . It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program , especially about the diversion of funds to the Contras , although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff . The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions . A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National Security Advisor more , thereby placing more power in the hands of that chair .

 The Democratic @-@ controlled United States Congress issued its own report on November 18 , 1987 , stating that " If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing , he should have " .

It also read that " the central remaining question is the role of the President in the Iran – Contra affair . On this critical point , the shredding of documents by Poindexter , North and others , and the death of Casey , leave the record incomplete " .

 Reagan expressed regret regarding the situation during a nationally televised address from the Oval Office on March 4 , 1987 , and two other speeches ; Reagan had not spoken to the American people directly for three months amidst the scandal . President Reagan told the American people the reason he did not update them on the scandal : 
 The reason I haven 't spoken to you before now is this : You deserve the truth . And as frustrating as the waiting has been , I felt it was improper to come to you with sketchy reports , or possibly even erroneous statements , which would then have to be corrected , creating even more doubt and confusion . There 's been enough of that . 
 He then took full responsibility for the acts committed : 
 First , let me say I take full responsibility for my own actions and for those of my administration . As angry as I may be about activities undertaken without my knowledge , I am still accountable for those activities . As disappointed as I may be in some who served me , I 'm still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior . 
 Finally , the president stated that his previous assertions that the U.S. did not trade arms for hostages were incorrect : 
 A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages . My heart and my best intentions still tell me that 's true , but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not . As the Tower board reported , what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated , in its implementation , into trading arms for hostages . This runs counter to my own beliefs , to administration policy , and to the original strategy we had in mind . 
 To this day , Reagan 's role in the transactions is not definitively known ; it is unclear exactly what Reagan knew and when , and whether the arms sales were motivated by his desire to save the U.S. hostages . Oliver North wrote that " Ronald Reagan knew of and approved a great deal of what went on with both the Iranian initiative and private efforts on behalf of the contras and he received regular , detailed briefings on both ... I have no doubt that he was told about the use of residuals for the Contras , and that he approved it . <unk> . " Handwritten notes by Defense Secretary Weinberger indicate that the President was aware of potential hostages transfers with Iran , as well as the sale of Hawk and TOW missiles to what he was told were " moderate elements " within Iran . Notes taken on December 7 , 1985 , by Weinberger record that Reagan said that " he could answer charges of illegality but he couldn 't answer charge [ sic ] that ' big strong President Reagan passed up a chance to free hostages ' " . The Republican @-@ written " Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran @-@ Contra Affair " concluded , that 
 There is some question and dispute about precisely the level at which he chose to follow the operation details . There is no doubt , however , ... [ that ] the President set the US policy towards Nicaragua , with few if any ambiguities , and then left subordinates more or less free to implement it . 
 Domestically , the scandal precipitated a drop in President Reagan 's popularity as his approval ratings saw " the largest single drop for any U.S. president in history " , from 67 % to 46 % in November 1986 , according to a New York Times / CBS News poll . The " Teflon President " , as Reagan was nicknamed by critics , survived the scandal , however , and by January 1989 a Gallup poll was " recording a 64 % approval rating " , the highest ever recorded for a departing President at that time . 
 Internationally , the damage was more severe . Magnus <unk> wrote , " U.S. willingness to engage in concessions with Iran and the Hezbollah not only signaled to its adversaries that hostage @-@ taking was an extremely useful instrument in extracting political and financial concessions for the West but also undermined any credibility of U.S. criticism of other states ' deviation from the principles of no @-@ negotiation and no concession to terrorists and their demands " . 
 In Iran , Mehdi Hashemi , the <unk> of the scandal , was executed in 1987 , allegedly for activities unrelated to the scandal . Though Hashemi made a full video confession to numerous serious charges , some observers find the coincidence of his leak and the subsequent prosecution highly suspicious .

 Oliver North and John Poindexter were indicted on multiple charges on March 16 , 1988 . North , indicted on 16 counts , was found guilty by a jury of three felony counts . The convictions were vacated on appeal on the grounds that North 's Fifth Amendment rights may have been violated by the indirect use of his testimony to Congress , which had been given under a grant of immunity . In 1990 , Poindexter was convicted on several felony counts of conspiracy , lying to Congress , obstruction of justice , and altering and destroying documents pertinent to the investigation . His convictions were also overturned on appeal on similar grounds . Arthur L. Liman served as chief counsel for the Senate during the Iran – Contra Scandal .

 During his election campaign in 1988 , Vice President Bush denied any knowledge of the Iran – Contra affair by saying he was " out of the loop " . Though his diaries included that he was " one of the few people that know fully the details " , he repeatedly refused to discuss the incident and won the election . However , a book published in 2008 by Israeli journalist and terrorism expert Ronen Bergman asserts that Bush was personally and secretly briefed on the affair by <unk> Nir , counterterrorism adviser to the then Israeli Prime Minister , when Bush was on a visit to Israel . " Nir could have incriminated the incoming President . The fact that Nir was killed in a mysterious chartered airplane crash in Mexico in December 1988 has given rise to numerous conspiracy theories " , writes Bergman . On December 24 , 1992 , nearing the end of his term in office after being defeated by Bill Clinton the previous month , Bush pardoned six administration officials , namely Elliott Abrams , Duane Clarridge , Alan Fiers , Clair George , Robert McFarlane , and Caspar Weinberger . 
 In Poindexter 's hometown of Odon , Indiana , a street was renamed to John Poindexter Street . Bill Breeden , a former minister , stole the street 's sign in protest of the Iran – Contra affair . He claimed that he was holding it for a ransom of $ 30 million , in reference to the amount of money given to Iran to transfer to the Contras . He was later arrested and confined to prison , making him , as satirically noted by Howard Zinn , " the only person to be imprisoned as a result of the Iran – Contra Scandal " .

 = USS Mahopac ( 1864 ) = 
 USS Mahopac was a single @-@ turreted Canonicus @-@ class monitor built for the Union Navy during the American Civil War . The vessel was assigned to the James River Flotilla of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron upon completion in September 1864 . The ship spent most of her time stationed up the James River where she could support operations against Richmond and defend against sorties by the Confederate ironclads of the James River Squadron . She engaged Confederate artillery batteries during the year and later participated in both attacks on Fort Fisher , defending the approaches to Wilmington , North Carolina , in December 1864 – January 1865 . Mahopac returned to the James River after the capture of Fort Fisher and remained there until Richmond , Virginia was occupied in early April . 
 A few days later , the monitor was transferred to Washington , D. C. and decommissioned in June and recommissioned in early 1866 for service on the East Coast and in the Caribbean . Mahopac generally remained active until 1889 when she was permanently placed in reserve . She was sold for scrap in 1902 . 
 = = Description and construction = = 
 The ship was 225 feet ( 68 @.@ 6 m ) long overall , had a beam of 43 feet 3 inches ( 13 @.@ 2 m ) and had a maximum draft of 13 feet 6 inches ( 4 @.@ 1 m ) . She had a tonnage of 1 @,@ 034 tons burthen and displaced 2 @,@ 100 long tons ( 2 @,@ 100 t ) . Her crew consisted of 100 officers and enlisted men . 
 Mahopac was powered by a two @-@ cylinder horizontal vibrating @-@ lever steam engine that drove one propeller using steam generated by two Stimers horizontal fire @-@ tube boilers . The 320 @-@ indicated @-@ horsepower ( 240 kW ) engine gave the ship a top speed of 8 knots ( 15 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 mph ) . She carried 140 – 150 long tons ( 140 – 150 t ) of coal . Mahopac 's main armament consisted of two smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading , 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) Dahlgren guns mounted in a single gun turret . Each gun weighed approximately 43 @,@ 000 pounds ( 20 @,@ 000 kg ) . They could fire a 350 @-@ pound ( 158 @.@ 8 kg ) shell up to a range of 2 @,@ 100 yards ( 1 @,@ 900 m ) at an elevation of + 7 ° . 
 The exposed sides of the hull were protected by five layers of one @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) wrought iron plates , backed by wood . The armor of the gun turret and the pilot house consisted of ten layers of one @-@ inch plates . The ship 's deck was protected by armor 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) thick . A 5 @-@ by @-@ 15 @-@ inch ( 130 by 380 mm ) soft iron band was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent shells and fragments from jamming the turret as had happened to earlier monitors during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863 . The base of the funnel was protected to a height of six feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) by eight inches ( 203 mm ) of armor . A " rifle screen " of 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ inch ( 13 mm ) armor three feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) high was installed on the top of the turret to protect the crew against Confederate snipers based on a suggestion by Commander Tunis A. M. Craven , captain of her sister ship Tecumseh . 
 The contract for Mahopac , named after Lake Mahopac in New York , was awarded to Secor & Co . ; the ship was laid down in 1862 by the primary subcontractor Joseph Colwell at his Jersey City , New Jersey shipyard . She was launched on 17 May 1864 and commissioned on 22 September 1864 with Commander William A. Parker in command . The ship 's construction was delayed by multiple changes ordered while she was being built that reflected battle experience with earlier monitors . This included the rebuilding of the turrets and pilot houses to increase their armor thickness from 8 inches ( 203 mm ) to 10 inches and to replace the bolts that secured their armor plates together with rivets to prevent them from being knocked loose by the shock of impact from shells striking the turret . Other changes included deepening the hull by 18 inches ( 457 mm ) to increase the ship 's buoyancy , moving the position of the turret to balance the ship 's trim and replacing all of the ship 's deck armor . The ship ultimately cost a total of $ 701 @,@ 624 , although the builder appealed for recompense for additional costs caused by the government 's delays and changes . The case was dismissed on 31 March 1919 . No modifications are known to have been made after the ship 's completion .

 Mahopac was fitting out at the Brooklyn Navy Yard until 4 October 1864 when , towed by two tugboats , she departed for Hampton Roads , Virginia and arrived there on 6 October . The ship arrived at City Point , Virginia on 3 November for service with the James River Flotilla . She engaged a Confederate artillery battery at Howlett 's Farm on 5 and 6 December together with her sisters Saugus and Canonicus . Mahopac was hit five times and lightly damaged ; she fired 41 shells in return , of which only six had any effect on the Confederate forces . 
 Escorted by the sidewheel gunboat Santiago de Cuba , Mahopac , now commanded by Lieutenant Commander E. E. Potter , was ordered on 11 December to steam for Beaufort , South Carolina to prepare for the first bombardment of Fort Fisher on 24 – 25 December . Plagued by steering problems as the bombardment began , the ship open fire late on the first day of the battle and fired 41 shells . The one hit that she received that day damaged her steering gear . Mahopac participated in the second day of the battle and was not damaged . After Butler ordered his men re @-@ embarked onto their transports on 26 December , the monitor was towed to Beaufort by the gunboat Fort Jackson . 
 Again towed by the Fort Jackson , Mahopac , now under the command of Lieutenant Commander A. W. Weaver , arrived back at Fort Fisher on 13 January 1865 . Together with Canonicus and Saugus , the double @-@ turreted monitor Onondaga and the armored frigate New Ironsides , she bombarded the fort for three days until it was captured by Union troops . On her second shot at the beginning of the battle , one of her 15 @-@ inch guns burst at the muzzle . Despite the loss of one gun , the ship fired 204 shells at the fort ; she was hit several times in return , but suffered neither damage nor casualties . 
 Transferred to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron , Mahopac was ordered to Charleston , South Carolina on 17 January , towed by the gunboat Nereus . The ship remained there on picket duty until 8 March when she returned to Chesapeake Bay and rejoined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron . She contributed boats for clearing the James River of " torpedoes " after the Confederate ships were scuttled on the night of 2 / 3 April and Richmond occupied . On 5 April , Mahopac and Saugus were to ordered report to the Washington Navy Yard . She was decommissioned in June and laid up there . 
 Mahopac was recommissioned on 15 January 1866 and served on the East Coast . Renamed Castor on 15 June 1869 , she resumed her original name on 10 August . The ship was placed in reserve on 11 March 1872 at Hampton Roads , but was recommissioned on 21 November 1873 . The ship was based at Key West , Florida until 1876 when she was transferred to Port Royal , South Carolina . Mahopac was transferred to Norfolk , Virginia in July 1877 and then moored at Brandon , Virginia , and at City Point , before being placed in ordinary at Richmond from 1889 to 1895 . The ship was transferred to League Island , Philadelphia in 1895 . She was struck from the Navy List on 14 January 1902 and was sold on 25 March 1902 . 
 = Travelers ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Travelers " is the fifteenth episode of the fifth season of American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files , and the 111th episode of the series overall . It was written by John Shiban and Frank Spotnitz , directed by William A. Graham and aired in the United States on March 29 , 1998 on the Fox network . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 9 @.@ 9 , being watched by 15 @.@ 06 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received mixed reviews from television critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this flashback episode , a young Fox Mulder visits retired FBI Agent Arthur Dales ( Darren McGavin ) , who tells him about one of the first X @-@ Files , a case that Mulder 's father , Bill , was involved in . 
 " Travelers " was written as a tribute to Howard Dimsdale , a screenwriter who was victimized by Hollywood blacklist in the 1950s and explored the idea that " the witch @-@ hunt [ of the 1950s ] was actually a smoke screen to conceal something else " . Noted actor Darren McGavin appears as Arthur Dales . McGavin was requested for the part especially by Chris Carter and had been approached to play various characters on the series before . In order to create a " convincing period movie " , various special effects were used , including a special facial appliance that allowed the " alien spider " to crawl out of Skur 's mouth and into his victim , and a bleaching job for the final film to give it an aged feel . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 1990 in Caledonia , Wisconsin , a man named Edward Skur is shot by a police officer during an eviction and the last word he speaks is " Mulder " . Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) , at this point working with the FBI 's Behavioral Science Unit , believes that the man may have had some connection to his father , Bill . Mulder discovers that Skur was reported to have died in 1952 . He seeks out Arthur Dales ( Darren McGavin ) , a retired FBI agent who investigated Skur in the 1950s . At first , Dales is reluctant to discuss the case and warns Mulder away . However , Mulder 's threat of a subpoena persuades Dales to tell his story . 
 In a flashback to the 1950s , Dales ( Fredric Lane ) and his partner Hayes Michel are sent to arrest Skur ( Garret <unk> ) for being a communist . When Dales is told that Skur hanged himself while in custody , he feels guilty and returns to Skur 's house to apologize to his wife . While there , he sees Skur alive and tries to recapture him . In the following struggle , an appendage emerges from Skur 's mouth . Skur is forced to flee when a neighbor interrupts the fight . Dales ' partner and Roy Cohn warn Dales to change his report about the attack . He does so , but feels guilty about it . 
 Later , Dales and Michel are called to investigate the death of a German doctor in Chevy Chase , Maryland . The local police deny calling them , and Dales finds a coaster for a bar with " come alone " written on the back . At the bar , Dales meets Bill Mulder , an agent from the State Department . Bill tells him that Skur was experimented on along with two other men , and those two men later killed themselves . Skur killed the German doctor in revenge for what was done to him , and he will kill Dales and Michel too because Skur believes they are part of the plot . Dales tries to warn Michel but he is too late and Skur kills him . Dales tries to investigate but Mr. Cohn covers it up . 
 A secretary at the FBI office , Dorothy Bahnsen ( played by Jane Perry ) , helps Dales find a file that mentions Gissing , one of the two men who committed suicide . ( She explains that she files all the unsolved cases under X because there is more room under X than U. ) Gissing 's body is still in the morgue and Dales convinces the technician to cut open the body where they find a strange creature has been sewn into Gissing 's chest . Dales goes to Skur 's wife and tells her what was done to her husband and that he wants to expose the experiments . Skur 's wife goes down into the backyard bomb shelter to tell Skur , but he is overcome by his parasite and kills her . 
 Cohn picks up Dales and takes him to the office of the Director who gives him a speech about patriotism and convinces him to help bring in Skur . They take Dales back to the bar to meet Skur , who attacks Dales . Bill Mulder and the other agent wait outside until they think Dales is dead before rushing in to find that Dales has handcuffed Skur and is still alive . 
 Back in the present Fox Mulder is dismayed to hear what his father was involved in . He asks Dales how Skur escaped and Dales speculates that someone might have helped Skur escape hoping that the truth of what was done to him may one day be revealed . The episode ends with a final flashback of Bill Mulder driving down a road with Skur and giving Skur the keys to the car and walking away .

 The episode was written as a tribute to Howard Dimsdale , a screenwriter who was victimized by Hollywood blacklist in the 1950s . Dimsdale wrote several movies under the pseudonym " Arthur Dales " , and thus , his name was the inspiration for the character of the same name in " Travelers " . For many years , Dimsdale had taught at the American Film Institute in Los Angeles ; two of his students were executive producer Frank Spotnitz and co @-@ producer John Shiban . The two decided to combine many of Dimsdale 's stories of " paranoia , treachery , and double @-@ dealing " with the idea that " the witch @-@ hunt was actually a smoke screen to conceal something else " . The writers soon realized that by setting the episode in the past , they would be able to " trace the roots of both Fox Mulder and the X @-@ Files " . 
 This episode does not feature Scully , as Gillian Anderson was busy still filming her final parts of Fight the Future . Noted actor Darren McGavin appears as Arthur Dales . He was requested for the part especially by Chris Carter . Casting director Rick Millikan noted , " McGavin was Chris 's inspiration for writing this series . He always had Darren in mind to use somewhere , and that was really his doing . He said ' I want Darren McGavin for this , ' and he happened to be available , and we got him . " McGavin had originally been casting directors ' first choice for the role of Senator Matheson for the second season opener " Little Green Men " . McGavin was later sought out to be Mulder 's dad , but he again eluded the staff . In the end , McGavin finally agreed to appear on the show playing Dales , the agent who originally founded the X @-@ Files . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Due to the time crunches of the fifth season , a " convincing period movie " was created in " less time than humanly possible " by members of The X @-@ Files 's production staff . Costume designer Jenni Gullet set about renting and creating vintage clothing from the fifties ; art director Gary Allen collected older copies of National Geographic to make J. Edgar Hoover 's office seem realistic to the period . Allen also constructed the bomb shelter , because his father was a contractor who had actually built several . 
 Special effects supervisor Toby Lindala created the " alien spider " as well as a special facial appliance that allowed the creature to crawl out of Skur 's mouth and into his victim . The final film was slightly bleached in post @-@ production to give it a " vintage appearance " . The production staff was pleased with the final product , noting that it does justice to both " the painful controversies of the 1950s " and The X @-@ Files as a " contemporary TV series " . The episode also contained several in @-@ jokes . The song playing in the German doctor 's house is a specially recorded cover of the popular song " Lili <unk> " ; the song 's record cover reads " Paula <unk> " , a reference to one of the series ' producers , Paul Rabwin . Agent Hayes Michel was named after the fiancé of Mary Astadourian , one of series creator Chris Carter 's executive assistants .

 In several shots , Mulder can be seen wearing a wedding band . This was David Duchovny 's idea ; he explained " That was just me , you know , fooling around . I had recently gotten married , and I wanted to wear it . " He later described the situation as " so Mulder to never have mentioned that he was married " . Series creator Chris Carter later told Duchovny that the situation " creates a problem . If we ever do a show that takes place seven years ago , you 'll have to be married . " However , Duchovny reassured Carter by pointing out that there were not very many episodes , if any , that had been planned to take place seven years prior to the events in this episode . The inclusion of the detail caused an " Internet frenzy " and the minor detail was never resolved on screen .

 " Travelers " received mixed reviews from critics . In a 2000 review of season five for the New Straits Times , Francis Dass noted that the episode possessed a " nice retro feel throughout " . Dass was also complimentary towards the fact that " Mulder senior is shown in action " during the episode . Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B and wrote positively of it , noting that , although the entry was designed as a " stall " , it felt like a " weird backdoor pilots for [ a show ] that never happened . " He noted that the episode " isn ’ t as good as it could have been " but argued that the story was " still a mostly fun " . In addition , VanDerWerff wrote positively of McGavin 's guest starring role and was complimentary towards the " alien spider thing " , describing it as " wonderfully gross " . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode four stars out of five and called it " fresh and urgent " . The two wrote that , while the episode was a stopgap , it " cannot be better placed . " They argued that " <unk> " ' s use of the " Communist witch hunt " conceit and its idea that " serving " means being a patriot , whereas " resisting " means being a traitor — a reference to the previous episode 's tagline — themes were well @-@ played . Shearman and Pearson , furthermore , praised McGavin 's acting , noting that he was " the series ' spiritual father " . 
 Other reviews were more critical . John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode 5 out of 10 and wrote , " Overall , this episode is an odd divergence from the normal series format , prompted by the production schedule for the feature film . [ ... ] Acceptable as a stand @-@ alone episode , it simply doesn ’ t fit within the overall scope of the series , and that makes it hard to judge objectively . " Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four . She noted that the episode , much like the earlier season five entry " Unusual Suspects " was " filler " , but that , unlike the earlier episode , " Travelers " was " not particularly entertaining . " Vitaris criticized the character of Arthur Dales and wrote that he was " not an intriguing character " . However , she did praise the visuals , describing them as " outstanding " .

In this episode , the assassination of a chess grandmaster leads Mulder and Scully into an investigation that they soon discover strikes at the heart of the X @-@ Files ; they learn that the real target was a telepathic boy named Gibson Praise . 
 The episode was originally supposed to be the series finale for the show , allowing the series to evolve into a film franchise following the release of the 1998 movie .

The episode would be the last to be filmed in Vancouver : production for the subsequent seasons moved to Los Angeles , California .

 Originally , the fifth season of The X @-@ Files was supposed to be the show 's last . In this manner , the finale of season five would have segued the series into a movie franchise . David Duchovny explained , " we were saying , ' Okay , we 're going to do five . We 'll get out of here at five . ' And then five came around , and no one was going anywhere . " The series proved to be so lucrative for Fox that two additional seasons were ordered . Thus , " The End " was created to segue into The X @-@ Files movie , as well as the sixth season premiere , " The Beginning " . 
 Near the beginning of the episode , Praise plays a Russian grandmaster at chess . The Complete X @-@ Files notes that the " chess motif " was carried on throughout the episode , most notably in the fact that The Smoking Man " plays Mulder to a checkmate , using Jeffrey as a pawn . " Because of this , and his past actions , many perceived The Smoking Man as the true villain of the story . William B. Davis , who played The Smoking Man , however , felt that the character was the hero of the story . He noted , " I used to go to conventions and try to convince everyone that I was the hero of the series and Mulder was the bad guy . [ … ] I got a lot of laughs , but it 's certainly true of how one plays the character . Nobody thinks they 're evil . " 
 = = = Casting and filming = = = 
 The episode introduced two new characters in Gibson Praise , played by Jeff Gulka , and Diana Fowley , portrayed by Mimi Rogers . Kim Manners later said of Gulka , " There was something about that kid 's personality that really came off on screen . He really exuded an intelligence that was pretty special . Chris saw what Bob Goodwin did with him and he knew that this kid was a special storytelling tool for the chronicle of the X @-@ Files " . Chris Carter said that Fowley " was a character you were destined to hate because she was a competitor for Mulder 's affection with Scully . Gillian Anderson said , " She didn 't make it easy on Scully . I think she was aware of her effect on Mulder and on the situation . " 
 This episode was the last episode of the series to be filmed in Vancouver , Canada prior to production moving to Los Angeles , California . The move was influenced in part by David Duchovny , who after five years of filming wanted to be closer to his wife . The audience at the chess match was made up of local fans as a " thank you " to the city for hosting the production during its first five years . The chess match was filmed at Rogers Arena — then known as GM Place — the home of the Vancouver Canucks as well as the Vancouver Grizzlies at the time . While the producers expected five thousand people to show up , twelve thousand appeared . Instructions were given to the crowd by director R. W. Goodwin using giant video screens attached to the scoreboard . During breaks between shooting concession stands , music and videos were made available to the attendees . Actors Duchovny and Anderson also answered questions for the audience and over $ 20 @,@ 000 worth of equipment was raffled off . Chris Carter directed the second unit filming for the episode in order to be with the show 's Canadian crew members .

 " The End " received mixed to positive reviews from critics . Lon Grahnke of Chicago Sun @-@ Times reacted positively towards the episode , describing it as " pivotal " . Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it three stars out of four . She wrote that the episode " is an effective , sometimes even moving , conclusion to a scattershot season . " Vitaris wrote that the entry was " far superior " to the season four season finale " Gethsemane " and praised the various character introductions , most notably that of Gibson Praise and Diana Fowley . She did , however , criticize the reappearance of Krycek and the fact that The Smoking Man was again working for the Syndicate . Critical Myth reviewer John Keegan gave the episode a 9 out 10 rating and wrote that , " Overall , this episode was a very good season finale , making sense of the season ’ s character arcs while setting the stage for the feature film . While the effect was somewhat mitigated by the fact that the episode also had to set up situations for the sixth season , it highlights Cancer Man ’ s strategic strengths in a way that previous episodes didn ’ t fully exploit . " In a 2000 review of season five for the New Straits Times , Francis Dass called " The End " a " gem " and praised the acting of Jeff Gulka , noting that he was a " great child actor " . 
 Other reviews were more mixed . Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review and grade it a C + . Handlen criticized the episode 's lack of resolution , noting that " The show can feed our social paranoia [ … ] but when it comes time to deliver on all this , to finally pull back the curtain and move on to the next stage , it fumbles things . " Furthermore , he called the Mulder / Scully / Fowley love triangle " immediately off @-@ putting " and criticized Mimi Rogers 's characterization . However , Handlen did call The Smoking Man 's return " thrilling " and wrote that the burning of Mulder 's office was " arguably one of the most iconic visuals in the run of the series " . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five . The two criticized the closing down of the X @-@ Files division , due largely to the fact that " we 've seen [ it ] before " , a reference to the divisions 's closing at the conclusion of the show 's first season . However , Shearman and Pearson wrote that " ' The End ' works in spite of itself " , citing the arrival of Diana Fowley and the confrontation between The Smoking Man and Jeffrey Spender as positive points in the episode . 
 = Tropical Storm Danielle ( 1992 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Danielle was a weak tropical storm that made landfall on Virginia in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season . The fourth storm of the season , Danielle was one of two tropical cyclones in the year to make landfall in the United States , the other being Hurricane Andrew . It formed out of a stationary trough of low pressure on September 18 near the coast of North Carolina . The system quickly reached tropical storm status , and Danielle looped to the west due to a change in steering currents . Tropical Storm Danielle reached a peak of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) winds before weakening and hitting the Delmarva Peninsula . The storm quickly dissipated over land . 
 The storm dropped light rainfall throughout its path , and winds were minimal . The combination of Danielle and a high pressure system produced higher than normal tides and strong waves , causing beach erosion and light coastal damage . The waves killed two in New Jersey from a boat sinking , and also destroyed three houses in the Outer Banks of North Carolina . Overall damage from the storm was minimal . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A surface trough of low pressure with an area of convection persisted off the southeast coast of the United States on September 18 . On the same day , a weak tropical wave which moved off the coast of Africa on September 8 approached the area . A cold front merged with the stationary area of disturbed weather on September 20 , and on September 22 a circulation developed 200 miles ( 325 km ) southeast of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina . Organization continued as outflow became better defined , and the system developed into Tropical Depression Six later that day . 
 The depression rapidly organized and attained tropical storm status with winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) just six hours after forming , upon which it was named Danielle . In response to an approaching trough , Danielle initially moved to the northeast . However , the trough outran the system , and a developing high pressure system to its north resulted in Danielle executing a tight , anticyclonic loop on September 23 to the 24th . The storm strengthened as it turned to the northwest , and reached a peak of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) winds on September 25 while just off the northeastern coast of North Carolina . Danielle turned to the north @-@ northwest , and made landfall on the Eastern Shore of Virginia late on the 25th . It rapidly weakened over land , and dissipated over eastern Pennsylvania on September 26 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Early in its life , forecasters had difficulties regarding the future track and intensity of Danielle , including a northeastward motion instead of its loop . After Danielle executed its loop , forecasters consistently predicted a landfall along the northeastern North Carolina coastline . As a result , officials issued Tropical Storm Warnings for the coast of North Carolina on September 24 , 36 hours before the storm passed to the east of the state . The continued northward motion caught forecasters off guard , and consequentially tropical storm warnings were not issued for the Delmarva Peninsula until just 12 hours before the storm made landfall . In addition , forecasters issued tropical storm warnings from Delaware through Watch Hill , Rhode Island , as a precaution . 
 In North Carolina , ferry operations between Ocracoke and the mainland at Hyde County were closed , while officials canceled schools in Dare County , North Carolina due to the approaching storm . Several families voluntarily evacuated St. George 's Island in southern St. Mary 's County , Maryland . In addition , officials in Delaware recommended evacuations for low @-@ level areas and beaches . As a precaution , officials set up two shelters in Kent County .

 The pressure gradient between Tropical Storm Danielle and a ridge of high pressure to its north produced moderately strong winds across eastern North Carolina , peaking at 58 mph ( 93 km / h ) at Alligator River Bridge . Several other locations reported over tropical storm force winds . The pressure gradient also produced higher than normal waves along the coastline , with a maximum of 20 feet ( 6 m ) at Duck . Despite passing close to the coastline , Danielle dropped only light rainfall , totaling to 0 @.@ 2 inches ( 5 mm ) at Cape Hatteras . However , locations in the central portion of the state experienced over 1 inch ( 25 mm ) of rainfall . 
 Waves and high tides from the storm caused flooding along the Pamlico Sound side of Ocracoke and southern Hatteras Island . High tides also resulted in overwash in Pea Island , forcing the closure of State Highway 17 due to 12 inches ( 305 mm ) of salt water . High tides from the storm also destroyed two houses in South Nags Head and one in Rodanthe , two of which were previously condemned after the 1991 Perfect Storm . Three other houses in the Outer Banks were threatened by the storm . Elsewhere in the Outer Banks , damage was minimal , and was limited to pedestrian ramps and steps to the beachfront .

 In Virginia , Tropical Storm Danielle produced peak wind gusts of 61 mph ( 98 km / h ) at Cape Henry , though sustained winds remained below tropical storm strength . Rainfall was light along the coast , totaling to around 0 @.@ 34 inches ( 8 @.@ 6 mm ) . However , outer bands of the storm produced heavier rainfall in the center portion of the state , peaking at 4 @.@ 09 inches ( 103 @.@ 88 m ) at Charlottesville . The storm also produced higher than usual tides , peaking at 4 @.@ 42 feet ( 1 @.@ 3 m ) at the mouth of the Elizabeth River in <unk> Point , as well as strong waves along the Virginia coastline . The waves caused significant overwash , leaving parts of Norfolk under 2 feet ( .6 m ) of water . Several homes , businesses , and cars were flooded , as well . The waves also eroded beaches along the coast . Overall , damage was minimal , and there were no reports of deaths or injuries . 
 Upon making landfall Danielle produced an estimated storm tide of 2 to 3 feet ( .6 to .9 m ) in Ocean City , Maryland . Wind gusts peaked at 53 mph ( 85 km / h ) , also in Ocean City . The storm produced moderate rainfall of over 3 inches ( 76 mm ) across the Eastern Shore of Maryland , while interior amounts experienced slightly lesser amounts of up to 2 @.@ 79 inches ( 71 mm ) in Pasadena . Waves from the storm caused minor to moderate beach erosion along the coastline , and the combination of waves and high tides caused moderate street flooding . Near Salisbury , the storm produced a possible hook echo , though no tornadoes were reported . Danielle caused no deaths or injuries in the state . 
 In Delaware , the storm dropped light precipitation , with a maximum amount of 3 @.@ 75 inches ( 95 mm ) in Smyrna . Wind gusts peaked at 66 mph ( 106 km / h ) at Cape Henlopen . Danielle caused 2 to 3 @-@ foot ( .6 to .9 @-@ m ) higher than normal tides , along with strong waves . The combination of the two flooded some coastal houses and resulted in significant beach and dune erosion . The waves also sank four boats and washed away a dock near Slaughter Beach . Gusty winds caused power outages in New Castle County , while persistent rainfall caused sewer interruptions . Overall , with the exception of the severe beach erosion , damage was minimal .

 Tropical Storm Danielle dropped light rainfall across much of New Jersey , with some areas in the southwestern portion of the state experiencing over 3 inches ( 76 mm ) . Strong waves from the storm washed out miles of beaches along the coastline . In Ocean City , the waves passed over the boardwalk and into houses . Further north , the waves crashed a four @-@ person , 35 @-@ foot ( 10 @-@ m ) sailboat near Island Beach State Park . Two managed to swim safely to shore , though the other two occupants drowned . 
 Danielle 's outer bands dropped light rainfall from Connecticut through Maine , with isolated locations in Rhode Island and Massachusetts reporting over 3 inches ( 76 mm ) . Damage in New England is unknown . 
 = ? Nycticebus linglom = 
 ? Nycticebus linglom is a fossil strepsirrhine primate from the Miocene of Thailand . Known only from a single tooth , an upper third molar , it is thought to be related to the living slow lorises ( genus Nycticebus ) , but the material is not sufficient to assign the species to Nycticebus with certainty , and the species name therefore uses open nomenclature . With a width of 1 @.@ 82 mm , this tooth is very small for a primate . It is triangular in shape , supported by a single root , and shows three main cusps , in addition to various crests . The absence of a fourth cusp , the hypocone , distinguishes it from various other prosimian primates . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 ? Nycticebus linglom was described in 1997 by French paleontologists Pierre Mein and Léonard Ginsburg in a report on the fossil mammals of Li Mae Long , a Miocene site in Thailand . The animal is known from a single tooth , and on the basis of comparisons with other prosimian primates Mein and Ginsburg concluded that it is most closely related to the living slow lorises ( genus Nycticebus ) . However , in view of the very limited material , they only tentatively assigned the fossil species to Nycticebus , using open nomenclature . The specific name , linglom , is the Thai word for " loris " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The single known tooth , a third upper molar ( M3 ) known as T Li 41 , is tiny , with a length of 1 @.@ 29 mm and width of 1 @.@ 82 mm . Mein and Ginsburg claim that it is the smallest known prosimian molar . The tooth is triangular in shape and shows a simple , reduced morphology . Three important cusps — the protocone , paracone , and metacone — are present , connected by a crest . They are low and rounded . The metacone , located at the back of the tooth , is closer to the protocone , which is on the front lingual corner ( the side of the tongue ) , than it is to the paracone on the front labial corner ( the side of the cheeks ) . The protocone is rounded on the lingual side and is attached to a weak crest on the front and back . On the front labial corner , a lengthy crest , the <unk> crest , is present , which includes a minor cusp known as a parastyle . Some wear is visible on the <unk> crest , and at the front of the tooth a contact facet with the preceding second upper molar is present . The tooth has a single , well @-@ developed root , which contains a number of grooves , suggesting that it consists of three smaller , fused rootlets . 
 ? Nycticebus linglom is much smaller than the fossil <unk> primates , and unlike tarsier M3s , the single known fossil is reduced in form and lacks a fourth main cusp , a hypocone . With its reduced , triangular form , it more closely resembles lorises ( family Lorisidae ) , but the absence of a hypocone also distinguishes it from the slender lorises ( Loris ) , the angwantibos ( <unk> ) , and the pygmy slow loris ( Nycticebus pygmaeus ) . The fossil genus <unk> lacks the rounded lingual face of the protocone seen in ? N. linglom and possesses additional cuspules . However , ? N. linglom strongly resembles the Bengal slow loris ( Nycticebus bengalensis ) , from which it is distinguished by its smaller size and fused roots . 
 = = Range and ecology = = 
 Li Mae Long , the collection site of ? N. linglom , is dated to the latest Early Miocene , corresponding to the European zone MN 4 , around 18 mya . It is in the Thai province of <unk> . The fossil fauna encompasses 34 species of mammals , including the tarsier Tarsius thailandica and the treeshrew Tupaia miocenica . Mein and Ginsburg conclude that the fauna represents a tropical forest environment close to a shallow lake .

 The Old Curiosity Shop is a 1911 American silent short drama film produced by the Thanhouser Company . The film is an adaptation of The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens that was limited to the time constrictions of the single reel format . The film focuses on the grandfather who gambles into poverty and the consequences which eventually claim the life of Little Nell . The surviving status of this film likely means that a more in @-@ depth and modern look at the film is possible . Its survival status and attribution as a Thanhouser film was noted by Kamilla Elliott in her 2003 book Rethinking the Novel / Film Debate under the title Little Nell . In 2012 , the work was confirmed to be a Thanhouser production at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival . The identification of the film as Little Nell arose due to head of the film having been lost .

The salient points of the story have been taken and thus the film moves along so as to forge an intelligent conception of the original . ... The condensation has been thoughtfully done , by one who evidently knows the possibilities and limitations of the reel . A worthy production that must needs win its reward . " According to Thanhouser Company Film Preservation , the film was confirmed as a Thanhouser production after its screening at Pordenone Silent Film Festival in 2012 . The film was listed under the title of " Little Nell " from the first intertitle because the head of the film is missing . However , the 2003 book Rethinking the Novel / Film Debate by Kamilla Elliott correctly attributes " Little Nell " as a Thanhouser production . The film is not the first known adaptation of the work , Essanay Studios released an identically titled work in 1909 . 
 = Demolition Plot J @-@ 7 = 
 Demolition Plot J @-@ 7 is the second extended play by American indie rock band Pavement , released in 1990 . The EP was the band 's first release on Chicago independent label Drag City , and its first release that was not self @-@ issued . Demolition Plot J @-@ 7 shared many of the same indie and punk rock influences of Pavement 's 1989 debut Slay Tracks ( 1933 @-@ 1969 ) , but also diversified the group 's sound by incorporating keyboards . 
 Many of the songs on Demolition J @-@ 7 were written while Scott Kannberg and Jason Fawkes were in their short @-@ lived band , Pa . After Stephen Malkmus heard demos recorded by Pa , the songs turned into a Pavement project . The recording session for Demolition J @-@ 7 was more difficult than for Slay Tracks due to tension between producer Gary Young and Fawkes . The EP received favorable reception from critics and fans , and solidified the band 's cult fanbase . 
 = = Background = = 
 Pavement had attained a degree of success within the underground music scene with its 1989 debut EP Slay Tracks ( 1933 @-@ 1969 ) . While Malkmus was traveling to parts of Europe , North Africa , and the Middle East , Kannberg managed Slay Track 's release on the band 's self @-@ owned label , Treble Kicker . Slay Tracks caught the attention of Dan Koretzky , an avid record collector working at Reckless Records in Chicago . Koretzky ordered 200 copies of the EP for the record store , and asked Kannberg to sign to his newly started independent label , Drag City . At the time the members of Pavement anticipated no further releases beyond Slay Tracks , and Kannberg initially expressed reluctance to sign to any label . Kannberg later said " I started talking to [ Koretzky ] and in our conversations he said ' I 'm starting this label . Do you want to do something for us ? ' I said , ' Well I don 't know if we 're even a band . Steve is off in Europe . ' He said , " Well if you want to I 'm up for it . ' " 
 While Malkmus was still abroad , Kannberg moved in with a friend and his roommate Jason Fawkes in Sacramento , California . Fawkes and Kannberg formed a new band called Pa , with Fawkes on drums . Kannberg said , " I didn 't know if Pavement was going to do anything so I just said , ' Let 's start another band . ' " The duo frequently jammed , and considered a future release on Drag City . Pa recorded a series of instrumental demos , including new songs " Two States " , " Forklift " , and " Collapse " , at Young 's Louder Than You Think studios during a trip to Stockton . After Kannberg and Fawkes had returned to Sacramento , Malkmus visited and the group decided to turn the Pa songs into a Pavement project . Malkmus wrote lyrics to " Forklift " and presented the band with " two or three other songs " he had previously written . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Demolition Plot J @-@ 7 was , like Slay Tracks and the Pa demos , recorded by Gary Young at his Louder Than You Think studios in Stockton . The recording took place on October 16 and October 17 , 1989 . Malkmus was influenced by the rehearsal style of jazz musicians as significant to the EP 's recording , saying " When we start recording , we 're really focused on what we 're doing . We know how it 's going to sound in the studio . We don 't have to worry if it 's sounding good in the rehearsal space . We take those prescriptions from the great jazz people and applied them to our own framework . " 
 The addition of Fawkes to the band created tension with Young . Young had served as the primary drummer on Slay Tracks , with Malkmus and Kannberg drumming on a few songs . Young did not play any drums for the Demolition Plot J @-@ 7 sessions , and expressed jealousy towards Fawkes , openly mocking the new drummer . However , Fawkes ultimately only played drums on the EP 's opening track " Forklift " , and Malkmus and Kannberg performed the rest of the songs . 
 = = Music = = 
 Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Heather Phares wrote in Allmusic 's biography of Pavement that , with Demolition Plot J @-@ 7 , Pavement " had begun to forge [ their ] influences into its own signature sound . " A review in the Baltimore City Paper likened the EP 's sound to " a cross between The Fall ( circa Frenz Experiment ) and Half Japanese " . A review in LA Weekly stated that " The guitar on ' Internal K @-@ Dart ' and ' Fork Lift ' is patently similar to Big Black and [ Dinosaur Jr . ] , but Pavement steer clear of the former 's pretentiously bleak posturing and the latter 's dreary self @-@ pity " . Malkmus noted the influence that jazz musicians had on the EP 's recording , and acknowledged jazz albums Interstellar Space by John Coltrane and Andrew ! ! ! by Andrew Hill as two of his favorite records . The EP is Pavement 's first to incorporate keyboards . 
 The first song on the album , " Forklift " , features fuzzy guitar effects , like much of the band 's early material . " Forklift " also incorporates what Pavement biographer Rob Jovanovic calls " almost Kraftwerk @-@ sounding " overdubbed electronic keyboard sounds in the chorus . " <unk> Trunk " is a punk @-@ influenced track with " thrashy guitars " , but it also includes " barroom Jerry Lee Lewis piano buried in the mix " . The next two tracks , " Recorder Grot " and " Internal K @-@ Dart " , are both heavy and guitar @-@ oriented songs . " Perfect Depth " is , according to Jovanovic , a " gloriously messy sonic assault " , and " reflects a more considered Malkmus attempt at lyric crafting , even if they are nonsensical and almost impossible to hear " . The EP ends with " Recorder Grot ( Rally ) " , a 21 @-@ second instrumental of guitar feedback .

 Between the release of Slay Tracks and the recording sessions for Demolition Plot J @-@ 7 , Koretzky formed Drag City with Dan Osborn . The first release from the label was the Royal Trux single " Hero Zero " , which sold well . Despite the new label 's early financial struggles , Drag City used the profit from " Hero Zero " to press and release 1000 copies of Demolition Plot J @-@ 7 . Kannberg designed the cover of the EP , as he had done previously with Slay Tracks . 
 Demolition Plot J @-@ 7 was met with favorable reviews upon its release , though most of these reviews were from underground music zines . One of the few reviewers from a major music magazine to review Demolition Plot J @-@ 7 upon its release , Robert Christgau of the Village Voice gave the EP a two @-@ star honorable mention , citing " Forklift " as a highlight . 
 Demolition Plot J @-@ 7 was ranked as the fourth best EP of 1990 in the Village Voice Pazz & Jop Critic 's Poll . Demolition Plot J @-@ 7 helped define the early " messed @-@ up , art @-@ steeped guitar noise " sound of Drag City , which would become a seminal independent label .

However , when Squidward and SpongeBob are alone , the events in Squidward 's story begin to occur . 
 The episode featured Max Schreck as Count Orlok , of the 1922 silent film Nosferatu , via stock footage . Episode writer Lender proposed the idea as a gag at the end of the episode , which series creator Stephen Hillenburg accepted . Before the idea of Count Orlok , Lender thought of " <unk> Harry " , an idea that was deleted . The episode received glowing positive reviews upon release .

Exasperated with his boss 's demands , Squidward attempts to scare SpongeBob into disliking the night shift by creating the legend of the " Hash @-@ Slinging Slasher " , a former fry cook employed by the restaurant during the night shift , who accidentally sliced off his own arm and was killed by a transportation bus late one night . He cautions SpongeBob about the multiple warning indications signaling the ghost 's impending arrival : lights flickering on and off , the phone ringing and nobody being on the other line , and the ghost of the bus arriving to deliver the slasher . 
 Although Squidward manages to reassure a petrified SpongeBob that his story is fiction , the two employees are alarmed by the strange , coincidental occurrences paralleling the fictitious omens surrounding the murderous Hash @-@ Slinging Slasher SpongeBob insists that these are clear indications of paranormal activity , whereas a dubious Squidward dismisses them as meaningless , until the warning signs continue recurring and reappearing , matching those described in the ghost story . 
 Finally , a mysterious , dark silhouette appears at the road outside the Krusty Krab matching Squidward 's description of the Hash @-@ Slinging Slasher . Both horrified men immediately realize that they are experiencing genuine supernatural events . Panicking and screaming , they are relieved when the strange , unidentified figure enters turns out to be a kid applying for a job , revealing that he had tried contacting the establishment by telephone , but had hung up out of nervousness . The flickering lights were credited to the antics of Count Orlok of the 1922 silent film Nosferatu , with whom the characters are inexplicably familiar .

The episode originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on September 6 , 2002 , with a TV @-@ Y7 parental rating . 
 Episode writer Lender proposed to have Count Orlok of the 1922 silent film Nosferatu appear as a gag at the end of the episode . Series creator Stephen Hillenburg accepted Lender 's proposal and allowed him to do it . Lender said , " Steve gave you the opportunities to do things that would really be memorable , if you could sell him on it . " Lender then searched for books with <unk> pictures of Count Orlok . However , the image of Count Orlok used in the episode was taken from the Internet . He said , " I searched what little there was of the Web back then . " Nick Jennings <unk> the smile on Count Orlok to make sure it matched Lender 's board drawing . Lender said , " It was my baby , and I held its hand until we shipped it overseas [ to Rough Draft Studios in South Korea ] . " Before his idea of Count Orlok , Lender thought of " <unk> Harry " , a deleted gag that concludes the broadcast episode , in which he initially flickers the lights .

 " Graveyard Shift " received very positive reviews upon release . Emily Estep of WeGotThisCovered.com ranked the episode No. 4 on her " Top 10 Episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants " list , saying , " [ It ] is another scary episode of SpongeBob , and it 's my favorite one . " She added , " I love ' Graveyard Shift ' for a myriad of reasons , but mostly because it puts the two SpongeBob SquarePants characters with the best chemistry together : Squidward and Spongebob . The episode is kind of like a puzzle , and SpongeBob 's relentless cheer in the midst of likely doom is inspiring . " 
 In his review for the DVD Talk , Jason Bovberg praised the episode for its " spooky <unk> " , stating that the episode scared his daughter . Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said , " A fun , ' scary ' ( for little kids ) SpongeBob that adults will appreciate , ' Graveyard Shift ' uses the old standby of the headless / <unk> / legless ( take your pick ) killer @-@ seeking @-@ revenge stories we all told as kids , and cleverly grafts it onto a ' SpongeBob at work ' storyline . " Mavis added , " I always enjoy it when Rodger Bumpass , the voice actor for Squidward , gets quiet and manipulative when he 's shining SpongeBob on , and here 's one of the best examples of that . " He praised Count Orlok 's cameo , " especially when they animate the vampire 's face into a goofy , giddy smile . " Mike Jackson of DVD Verdict said the episode is one of his " personal <unk> . " He also said " [ The episode ] has everything that makes the show great : funny dialogue ( the whole story of the Hash @-@ Slinging Slasher is hilarious ) , clever sight gags ( especially Spongebob 's regenerating limbs ) , and that aforementioned outta @-@ nowhere ending that made me bust a gut .

 = Radetzky @-@ class battleship = 
 The Radetzky class was a group of three semi @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy between 1907 and 1910 . All ships were built by the STT shipyard in Trieste . They were the last pre @-@ dreadnoughts built by the Austro @-@ Hungarians , and the penultimate class of any type of Austro @-@ Hungarian battleship completed . The class comprised three ships : Radetzky , Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand , and Zrínyi . They were armed with four 30 @.@ 5 @-@ centimeter ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) guns in two twin turrets and eight 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns in four twin turrets ; the heavy secondary guns set the Radetzky @-@ class ships apart from other pre @-@ dreadnought type battleships . 
 Commissioned only a few years before the outbreak of World War I , the ships had limited service careers . All three of the battleships conducted training cruises in the Mediterranean Sea in 1912 . In 1913 , they took part in an international naval demonstration in the Ionian Sea that protested the Balkan Wars . After Italy declared war on Austro @-@ Hungary and the other Central Powers in 1915 , the three Radetzky @-@ class ships bombarded coastal targets in the Adriatic Sea . After 1915 , their participation in the war became minimal . All three ships were handed over to Italy after the end of the war , and broken up for scrap between 1920 and 1926 .

 Design work for a new class of battleships started about two weeks after the launching of Erzherzog Friedrich , an Erzherzog Karl @-@ class battleship , which took place on April 30 , 1904 . By the end of July 1905 , the Austrian Commander in Chief of the Navy , Admiral <unk> , laid out his vision for an expanded Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet . This included 12 battleships , four armored cruisers , eight scout cruisers , 18 destroyers , 36 large torpedo boats , and six submarines . A navy design board evaluated five designs for the new battleship type between September 25 – 29 , 1905 . 
 The first design was armed with four 28 cm ( 11 in ) guns in two twin turrets , four 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns in single turrets , and eight 19 cm ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) guns in casemates . The second design retained the 28 and 24 cm guns as in the first version , though altered the tertiary guns to twelve 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) guns . The third design , representative of the new dreadnought type of battleship that was being contemplated in other navies , featured eight 28 cm guns in four twin turrets , one fore , one aft , and two wing turrets . The heavy secondary guns were dispensed with altogether , and the light @-@ caliber guns were increased to sixteen 10 cm guns . The fourth design was a variation on the third type ; the eight 28 cm guns were replaced by six 30 @.@ 5 cm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) guns , in two twin turrets and two single turrets . The 10 cm guns remained the same . The final design mounted four 30 @.@ 5 cm guns in two twin turrets , eight 19 cm guns in four wing turrets , and twelve 10 cm guns in casemates . The leader of the design staff , Siegfried Popper , advocated the construction of an " all @-@ big @-@ gun " ship . However , Austro @-@ Hungarian dock facilities at the time limited displacement to 16 @,@ 000 long tons ( 16 @,@ 000 t ) ; the two " dreadnought " type designs were too heavy . 
 Popper eventually relented , after admitting that the larger dreadnought type design would also warrant the construction of a new floating dry dock , which would significantly increase the cost of the project . The design board selected the fifth design , though during refinement of the design , the secondary guns were increased in caliber from 19 cm to 24 cm . The 30 @.@ 5 cm gun was chosen because the breech of the new 28 cm was unreliable . The resulting design was the last pre @-@ dreadnought type of battleship built by the Austro @-@ Hungarian navy . 
 Underwater protection was also emphasized . Between August and November 1906 , the Austro @-@ Hungarian navy conducted explosive tests using the 50 @-@ year @-@ old ironclad Kaiser Max . The tests were conducted with 10 kilograms ( 22 lb ) , in an attempt to investigate blast effects of the standard 100 kilograms ( 220 lb ) naval mine on a 1 : 10 scale . The tests were generally unsuccessful ; as a result , Popper devised a mathematical model to predict the strength the underwater protection system would require to adequately protect the new battleships . The ships were ultimately equipped with an armored double bottom for defense against mines and torpedoes .

 The Radetzky @-@ class ships were 137 @.@ 5 m ( 451 ft 1 in ) long at the waterline and 138 @.@ 8 m ( 455 ft 5 in ) long overall . They had a beam of 24 @.@ 6 m ( 80 ft 9 in ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 1 m ( 26 ft 7 in ) . The ships were designed to displace 14 @,@ 508 long tons ( 14 @,@ 741 t ) normally , and up to 15 @,@ 845 @.@ 5 long tons ( 16 @,@ 099 @.@ 8 t ) with a full combat load . Machinery consisted of two four @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion engines . Each engine was powered by six Yarrow boilers . Power output was 19 @,@ 800 indicated horsepower ( 14 @,@ 800 kW ) , for a top speed of 20 @.@ 5 knots ( 38 @.@ 0 km / h ; 23 @.@ 6 mph ) . The ships carried 1 @,@ 350 long tons ( 1 @,@ 370 t ) of coal , which enabled a maximum range of 4 @,@ 000 nmi ( 7 @,@ 400 km ; 4 @,@ 600 mi ) at a cruising speed of 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The Radetzky @-@ class ships , as noted above , carried a main battery of four 30 @.@ 5 cm ( 12 in ) 45 @-@ caliber guns in two twin gun turrets . The guns were built by Škoda Works in Pilsen . They were capable of a rate of fire of three shells in the first minute , and then 1 to 2 rounds per minute afterward . The guns fired armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) shells that weighed 450 kg ( 990 lb ) and required a 138 kg ( 304 lb ) propellant charge . Their muzzle velocity was 800 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ) . The turrets could depress to − 3 ° and elevate to 20 ° . At maximum elevation , the guns could hit targets out to 20 @,@ 000 m ( 22 @,@ 000 yd ) . These turrets suffered from a number of design faults ; among them were the overly @-@ large cupolas on top . If a cupola was struck by gunfire , the thin top armor could be peeled back . Another serious issue was a defect in the ventilation system : when the turret was being ventilated under combat conditions , the system would duct toxic propellant gases into the gun house . It was estimated that the turrets contained only 15 minutes of oxygen once the ventilation system was activated . 
 The ships carried a heavy secondary battery of eight 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns in four twin turrets . The turrets were mounted amidships , two on either side . These guns had nearly half the penetration power of the larger 30 @.@ 5 cm guns , and approximately 25 % shorter range . The secondary armament was augmented by twenty 10 cm L / 50 guns in single mounts . These guns fired 26 @.@ 2 kg ( 58 lb ) shells at a rate of between 8 and 10 rounds per minute . The shells were fired at a muzzle velocity of 880 m / s ( 2 @,@ 900 ft / s ) and could hit targets out to 11 @,@ 000 m ( 12 @,@ 000 yd ) . Radetzky and her sisters also carried several smaller caliber guns , including two 66 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) landing guns , four 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) L / 44 and one 47 mm L / 33 quick @-@ firing guns . Three 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes were also carried , two on the beams and one in the stern . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The ships had an armored belt that was 230 mm ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) thick in the central portion of the ship , where it protected the ammunition magazines , machinery spaces , and other critical areas of the ship . Forward and to the rear of the main battery barbettes , the belt reduced in thickness to 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) . A 54 mm ( 2 @.@ 1 in ) thick torpedo bulkhead ran the length of the hull to provide a second layer of underwater protection should the main belt be penetrated . The armored deck was 48 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) thick , and supported by a sloped deck that was also 48 mm thick . 
 The main battery turrets were heavily armored . Their sides and face were 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) thick , while their roofs were 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick . The turrets for the secondary 24 cm guns had slightly less armor , with 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides and 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick roofs . The casemates that mounted the 10 cm guns were protected with 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) worth of armor plating . The armored conning tower had 250 mm @-@ thick sides and a 100 mm @-@ thick roof .

 The three Radetzky @-@ class battleships were assigned to the 2nd Division of the 1st Battle Squadron , alongside the Tegetthoff ships in the 1st Division . The three ships conducted several training cruises in the Mediterranean Sea after their commissioning in 1910 – 11 . Radetzky was present during the British Coronation Review at Spithead in 1911 . In 1912 , Zrínyi took part in a training cruise with the recently commissioned dreadnoughts Tegetthoff and Viribus Unitis in the eastern Mediterranean , which included a stop at Malta . The following year , the three ships were involved in an international naval demonstration to protest the raging Balkan Wars ; during the operation the first seaplanes to be launched from a warship in combat were operated from Radetzky and her sisters .
