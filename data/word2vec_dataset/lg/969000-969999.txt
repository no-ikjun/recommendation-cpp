 The original <unk> Doukhobor Village was discovered by the Saskatchewan Highways and Transportation when undertaking construction of new lanes for Provincial Hwy 5 northwest of Saskatoon , and west of Langham . Excavations commenced August 23 , 1996 . A 1944 aerial photograph was superimposed upon the Hwy 5 construction area showing house foundations .

 The early Provincial Highway 14 in the east and Provincial Highway 5 to the west were built and driven on the square . In 1957 , the Trans @-@ Canada Highway opened , and soon after , the Yellowhead became eligible for federal funding . The opening ceremonies for the Yellowhead were held in 1962 , and the highway was finished in 1965 . Provincial highway 14 was widened in 1957 . The route was straightened bypassing Plunkett and Viscount . 
 The 1957 road specifications were a right of way of 150 ′ and a road surface of 38 ′ . The centre 22 ′ of this road was oiled , leaving 8 ′ gravel shoulders on each side . 
 In 1968 the road was once again rebuilt ... the right of way was widened to 180 ′ and the road . Improvements were made on this northern route , and on August 15 , 1970 , the Yellowhead Route was officially opened . 
 This road was fully paved .... In 1978 when # 14 became part of the Yellowhead Route the number was changed to 16 . 
 The Yellowhead Regional Economic Development Authority ( REDA ) came into formation April 1998 to encourage economic development by towns , villages , rural municipalities along the Yellowhead Route . This was Saskatchewan 's 25th REDA and it included the founding members of Langenburg , Churchbridge and <unk> , <unk> , Langenburg No. 181 and Churchbridge No. 211 .

 Canada is one of the only industrialized countries without a federally funded highway system ... Recent federal policy changes have meant that freight , which was moved by rail , is now being moved by road . This has placed enormous stress on our roads .

Highways and Transportation Minister Maynard Sonntag commented that 
 twinning on the Yellowhead Highway will help to save lives , along with improving driver safety and comfort ... We are on track to meeting our twinning commitment for the national highway <unk> and Transportation Minister Maynard Sonntag 
 The four @-@ lane twinned highway between Saskatoon and North Battleford was officially opened December 8 , 1997 by Highways and Transportation Minister Judy Bradley and Federal Transport Minister David <unk> . $ 42 @.@ 4 million was spent on this twinning creating 
 92 kilometres ( 57 mi ) of new highway , a new bridge over the north Saskatchewan River near Borden and a new railway underpass . - Government of Saskatchewan 
 Construction of these improvements cost $ 42 @.@ 4 million . The Strategic Highway Improvement Program ( <unk> ) was a program between the federal and provincial government to upgrade highways with a main focus over five years to twin this section of the Yellowhead . By 2012 the Yellowhead is to be twinned from Saskatoon to the Alberta boundary . $ 164 million has been allocated for the two national highways in Saskatchewan , to finish twinning the Trans @-@ Canada Highway 1 and to twin the Yellowhead between North Battleford and Lloydminster by the Federal and provincial governments on March 5 , 2003 .

 San Francisco ( / <unk> <unk> / ) , officially the City and County of San Francisco , is the cultural , commercial , and financial center of Northern California and the only consolidated city @-@ county in California . San Francisco encompasses a land area of about 46 @.@ 9 square miles ( 121 km2 ) on the northern end of the San Francisco Peninsula , which makes it the smallest county in the state . It has a density of about 18 @,@ 451 people per square mile ( 7 @,@ 124 people per km2 ) , making it the most densely settled large city ( population greater than 200 @,@ 000 ) in the state of California and the second @-@ most densely populated major city in the United States after New York City . San Francisco is the fourth @-@ most populous city in California , after Los Angeles , San Diego , and San Jose , and the 13th @-@ most populous city in the United States — with a Census @-@ estimated 2015 population of 864 @,@ 816 . The city and its surrounding areas are known as the San Francisco Bay Area , and are a part of the larger OMB @-@ designated San Jose @-@ San Francisco @-@ Oakland combined statistical area , the fifth most populous in the nation with an estimated population of 8 @.@ 7 million . 
 San Francisco ( Spanish for Saint Francis ) was founded on June 29 , 1776 , when colonists from Spain established Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San Francisco de Asís named for St. Francis of Assisi a few miles away . The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth , making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time . San Francisco became a consolidated city @-@ county in 1856 . After three @-@ quarters of the city was destroyed by the 1906 earthquake and fire , San Francisco was quickly rebuilt , hosting the Panama @-@ Pacific International Exposition nine years later . In World War II , San Francisco was the port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater . After the war , the confluence of returning servicemen , massive immigration , liberalizing attitudes , along with the rise of the " hippie " counterculture , the Sexual Revolution , the Peace Movement growing from opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War , and other factors led to the Summer of Love and the gay rights movement , cementing San Francisco as a center of liberal activism in the United States . Politically , the city votes strongly along liberal Democratic Party lines . 
 A popular tourist destination , San Francisco is known for its cool summers , fog , steep rolling hills , eclectic mix of architecture , and landmarks , including the Golden Gate Bridge , cable cars , the former Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary , Fisherman 's Wharf , and its Chinatown district . San Francisco is also the headquarters of five major banking institutions and various other companies such as Levi Strauss & Co . , Gap Inc . , Salesforce.com , Dropbox , Reddit , Square , Inc . , Dolby , Airbnb , <unk> , Pacific Gas and Electric Company , Yelp , Pinterest , Twitter , Uber , <unk> , Mozilla , Wikimedia Foundation , and Craigslist . It has several nicknames , including " The City by the Bay " , " Fog City " , " San Fran " , and " Frisco " , as well as older ones like " The City that Knows How " , " Baghdad by the Bay " , " The Paris of the West " , or simply " The City " . As of 2015 , San Francisco was ranked high on world livability rankings . 
 = = History = = 
 The earliest archaeological evidence of human habitation of the territory of the city of San Francisco dates to 3000 BC . The Yelamu group of the Ohlone people resided in a few small villages when an overland Spanish exploration party , led by Don Gaspar de Portolà , arrived on November 2 , 1769 , the first documented European visit to San Francisco Bay . Seven years later , on March 28 , 1776 , the Spanish established the Presidio of San Francisco , followed by a mission , Mission San Francisco de Asís ( Mission Dolores ) , established by the Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza . 
 Upon independence from Spain in 1821 , the area became part of Mexico . Under Mexican rule , the mission system gradually ended , and its lands became privatized . In 1835 , Englishman William Richardson erected the first independent homestead , near a boat anchorage around what is today Portsmouth Square . Together with Alcalde Francisco de Haro , he laid out a street plan for the expanded settlement , and the town , named Yerba Buena , began to attract American settlers . Commodore John D. Sloat claimed California for the United States on July 7 , 1846 , during the Mexican – American War , and Captain John B. Montgomery arrived to claim Yerba Buena two days later . Yerba Buena was renamed San Francisco on January 30 of the next year , and Mexico officially ceded the territory to the United States at the end of the war . Despite its attractive location as a port and naval base , San Francisco was still a small settlement with inhospitable geography . 
 The California Gold Rush brought a flood of treasure seekers ( known as " forty @-@ niners " , as in " 1849 " ) . With their sourdough bread in tow , prospectors accumulated in San Francisco over rival Benicia , raising the population from 1 @,@ 000 in 1848 to 25 @,@ 000 by December 1849 . The promise of fabulous riches was so strong that crews on arriving vessels deserted and rushed off to the gold fields , leaving behind a forest of masts in San Francisco harbor . Some of these approximately 500 abandoned ships were used at times as storeships , saloons and hotels ; many were left to rot and some were sunk to establish title to the underwater lot . By 1851 the harbor was extended out into the bay by wharves while buildings were erected on piles among the ships . By 1870 Yerba Buena Cove had been filled to create new land . Buried ships are occasionally exposed when foundations are dug for new buildings . 
 California was quickly granted statehood , and the U.S. military built Fort Point at the Golden Gate and a fort on Alcatraz Island to secure the San Francisco Bay . Silver discoveries , including the Comstock Lode in 1859 , further drove rapid population growth . With hordes of fortune seekers streaming through the city , lawlessness was common , and the Barbary Coast section of town gained notoriety as a haven for criminals , prostitution , and gambling . 
 Entrepreneurs sought to capitalize on the wealth generated by the Gold Rush . Early winners were the banking industry , with the founding of Wells Fargo in 1852 and the Bank of California in 1864 . Development of the Port of San Francisco and the establishment in 1869 of overland access to the Eastern U.S. rail system via the newly completed Pacific Railroad ( the construction of which the city only reluctantly helped support ) helped make the Bay Area a center for trade . Catering to the needs and tastes of the growing population , Levi Strauss opened a dry goods business and Domingo <unk> began manufacturing chocolate . Immigrant laborers made the city a polyglot culture , with Chinese Railroad Workers , drawn to " Old Gold Mountain " , creating the city 's Chinatown quarter . In 1870 , Asians made up 8 % of the population . The first cable cars carried San Franciscans up Clay Street in 1873 . The city 's sea of Victorian houses began to take shape , and civic leaders campaigned for a spacious public park , resulting in plans for Golden Gate Park . San Franciscans built schools , churches , theaters , and all the hallmarks of civic life . The Presidio developed into the most important American military installation on the Pacific coast . By 1890 , San Francisco 's population approached 300 @,@ 000 , making it the eighth @-@ largest city in the U.S. at the time . Around 1901 , San Francisco was a major city known for its flamboyant style , stately hotels , ostentatious mansions on Nob Hill , and a thriving arts scene . The first North American plague epidemic was the San Francisco plague of 1900 – 1904 . 
 At 5 : 12 am on April 18 , 1906 , a major earthquake struck San Francisco and northern California . As buildings collapsed from the shaking , ruptured gas lines ignited fires that spread across the city and burned out of control for several days . With water mains out of service , the Presidio Artillery Corps attempted to contain the inferno by dynamiting blocks of buildings to create firebreaks . More than three @-@ quarters of the city lay in ruins , including almost all of the downtown core . Contemporary accounts reported that 498 people lost their lives , though modern estimates put the number in the several thousands . More than half of the city 's population of 400 @,@ 000 was left homeless . Refugees settled temporarily in makeshift tent villages in Golden Gate Park , the Presidio , on the beaches , and elsewhere . Many fled permanently to the East Bay . 
 Rebuilding was rapid and performed on a grand scale . Rejecting calls to completely remake the street grid , San Franciscans opted for speed . Amadeo Giannini 's Bank of Italy , later to become Bank of America , provided loans for many of those whose livelihoods had been devastated . The influential San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association or <unk> was founded in 1910 to address the quality of housing after the earthquake . The earthquake hastened development of western neighborhoods that survived the fire , including Pacific Heights , where many of the city 's wealthy rebuilt their homes . In turn , the destroyed mansions of Nob Hill became grand hotels . City Hall rose again in splendid Beaux Arts style , and the city celebrated its rebirth at the Panama @-@ Pacific International Exposition in 1915 . 
 It was during this period San Francisco built some of its most important infrastructure . Civil Engineer Michael O 'Shaughnessy was hired by San Francisco Mayor James Rolph as chief engineer for the city in September 1912 to supervise the construction of the Twin Peaks Reservoir , the Stockton Street Tunnel , the Twin Peaks Tunnel , the San Francisco Municipal Railway , the Auxiliary Water Supply System , and new sewers . San Francisco 's streetcar system , of which the J , K , L , M , and N lines survive today , was pushed to completion by O 'Shaughnessy between 1915 and 1927 . It was the O 'Shaughnessy Dam , Hetch Hetchy Reservoir , and Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct that would have the largest effect on San Francisco . An abundant water supply enabled San Francisco to develop into the city it has become today . 
 In ensuing years , the city solidified its standing as a financial capital ; in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash , not a single San Francisco @-@ based bank failed . Indeed , it was at the height of the Great Depression that San Francisco undertook two great civil engineering projects , simultaneously constructing the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge , completing them in 1936 and 1937 respectively . It was in this period that the island of Alcatraz , a former military stockade , began its service as a federal maximum security prison , housing notorious inmates such as Al Capone , and Robert Franklin Stroud , The Birdman of Alcatraz . San Francisco later celebrated its regained grandeur with a World 's fair , the Golden Gate International Exposition in 1939 – 40 , creating Treasure Island in the middle of the bay to house it . 
 During World War II , the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard became a hub of activity , and Fort Mason became the primary port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater of Operations . The explosion of jobs drew many people , especially African Americans from the South , to the area . After the end of the war , many military personnel returning from service abroad and civilians who had originally come to work decided to stay . The UN Charter creating the UN was drafted and signed in San Francisco in 1945 and , in 1951 , the Treaty of San Francisco officially ended the war with Japan . 
 Urban planning projects in the 1950s and 1960s involved widespread destruction and redevelopment of west @-@ side neighborhoods and the construction of new freeways , of which only a series of short segments were built before being halted by citizen @-@ led opposition . The onset of containerization made San Francisco 's small piers obsolete , and cargo activity moved to the larger Port of Oakland . The city began to lose industrial jobs and turned to tourism as the most important segment of its economy . The suburbs experienced rapid growth , and San Francisco underwent significant demographic change , as large segments of the white population left the city , supplanted by an increasing wave of immigration from Asia and Latin America . From 1950 to 1980 , the city lost over 10 percent of its population . 
 Over this period , San Francisco became a magnet for America 's counterculture . Beat Generation writers fueled the San Francisco Renaissance and centered on the North Beach neighborhood in the 1950s . Hippies flocked to Haight @-@ Ashbury in the 1960s , reaching a peak with the 1967 Summer of Love . In 1974 , the Zebra murders left at least 16 people dead . In the 1970s , the city became a center of the gay rights movement , with the emergence of The Castro as an urban gay village , the election of Harvey Milk to the Board of Supervisors , and his assassination , along with that of Mayor George Moscone , in 1978 . 
 Bank of America completed 555 California Street in 1969 and the Transamerica Pyramid was completed in 1972 , igniting a wave of " <unk> " that lasted until the late 1980s , a period of extensive high @-@ rise development downtown . The 1980s also saw a dramatic increase in the number of homeless people in the city , an issue that remains today , despite many attempts to address it . The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake caused destruction and loss of life throughout the Bay Area . In San Francisco , the quake severely damaged structures in the Marina and South of Market districts and precipitated the demolition of the damaged Embarcadero Freeway and much of the damaged Central Freeway , allowing the city to reclaim The Embarcadero as its historic downtown waterfront and revitalizing the Hayes Valley neighborhood . 
 The last 20 years have seen two booms driven by the internet industry . First was the dot @-@ com boom of the late 1990s , startup companies invigorated the San Francisco economy . Large numbers of entrepreneurs and computer application developers moved into the city , followed by marketing , design , and sales professionals , changing the social landscape as once @-@ poorer neighborhoods became increasingly gentrified . Demand for new housing and office space ignited a second wave of high @-@ rise development , this time in the South of Market district . By 2000 , the city 's population reached new highs , surpassing the previous record set in 1950 . When the bubble burst in 2001 , many of these companies folded and their employees were laid off . Yet high technology and entrepreneurship remain mainstays of the San Francisco economy . By the mid 2000s ( decade ) , the social media boom had begun , with San Francisco becoming a popular location for tech offices and a popular place to live for people employed in Silicon Valley companies such as Apple and Google . 
 = = Geography = = 
 San Francisco is located on the West Coast of the United States at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula and includes significant stretches of the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay within its boundaries . Several picturesque islands — Alcatraz , Treasure Island and the adjacent Yerba Buena Island , and small portions of Alameda Island , Red Rock Island , and Angel Island — are part of the city . Also included are the uninhabited Farallon Islands , 27 miles ( 43 km ) offshore in the Pacific Ocean . The mainland within the city limits roughly forms a " seven @-@ by @-@ seven @-@ mile square " , a common local colloquialism referring to the city 's shape , though its total area , including water , is nearly 232 square miles ( 600 km2 ) . 
 There are more than 50 hills within city limits . Some neighborhoods are named after the hill on which they are situated , including Nob Hill , Potrero Hill , and Russian Hill . Near the geographic center of the city , southwest of the downtown area , are a series of less densely populated hills . Twin Peaks , a pair of hills forming one of the city 's highest points , forms a popular overlook spot . San Francisco 's tallest hill , Mount Davidson , is 928 feet ( 283 m ) high and is capped with a 103 @-@ foot ( 31 m ) tall cross built in 1934 . Dominating this area is Sutro Tower , a large red and white radio and television transmission tower . 
 The nearby San Andreas and Hayward Faults are responsible for much earthquake activity , although neither physically passes through the city itself . The San Andreas Fault caused the earthquakes in 1906 and 1989 . Minor earthquakes occur on a regular basis . The threat of major earthquakes plays a large role in the city 's infrastructure development . The city constructed an auxiliary water supply system and has repeatedly upgraded its building codes , requiring retrofits for older buildings and higher engineering standards for new construction . However , there are still thousands of smaller buildings that remain vulnerable to quake damage . USGS has released the California earthquake forecast which models earthquake occurrence in California . 
 San Francisco 's shoreline has grown beyond its natural limits . Entire neighborhoods such as the Marina , Mission Bay , and Hunters Point , as well as large sections of the Embarcadero , sit on areas of landfill . Treasure Island was constructed from material dredged from the bay as well as material resulting from tunneling through Yerba Buena Island during the construction of the Bay Bridge . Such land tends to be unstable during earthquakes . The resulting liquefaction causes extensive damage to property built upon it , as was evidenced in the Marina district during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake . Most of the city 's natural watercourses , such as Islais Creek and Mission Creek , have been culverted and built over , although the Public Utilities Commission is studying proposals to daylight or restore some creeks .

 The historic center of San Francisco is the northeast quadrant of the city anchored by Market Street and the waterfront . It is here that the Financial District is centered , with Union Square , the principal shopping and hotel district , and the Tenderloin nearby . Cable cars carry riders up steep inclines to the summit of Nob Hill , once the home of the city 's business tycoons , and down to the waterfront tourist attractions of Fisherman 's Wharf , and Pier 39 , where many restaurants feature Dungeness crab from a still @-@ active fishing industry . Also in this quadrant are Russian Hill , a residential neighborhood with the famously crooked Lombard Street ; North Beach , the city 's Little Italy and the former center of the Beat Generation ; and Telegraph Hill , which features Coit Tower . Abutting Russian Hill and North Beach is San Francisco 's Chinatown , the oldest Chinatown in North America . The South of Market , which was once San Francisco 's industrial core , has seen significant redevelopment following the construction of AT & T Park and an infusion of startup companies . New skyscrapers , live @-@ work lofts , and condominiums dot the area . Further development is taking place just to the south in Mission Bay area , a former railroad yard , which now has a second campus of the University of California , San Francisco , and where the new Warrior 's stadium will be built . 
 West of downtown , across Van Ness Avenue , lies the large Western Addition neighborhood , which became established with a large African American population after World War II . The Western Addition is usually divided into smaller neighborhoods including Hayes Valley , the Fillmore , and Japantown , which was once the largest Japantown in North America but suffered when its Japanese American residents were forcibly removed and interned during World War II . The Western Addition survived the 1906 earthquake with its Victorians largely intact , including the famous " Painted Ladies " , standing alongside Alamo Square . To the south , near the geographic center of the city is Haight @-@ Ashbury , famously associated with 1960s hippie culture . The Haight is now home to some expensive boutiques and a few controversial chain stores , although it still retains some bohemian character . North of the Western Addition is Pacific Heights , an affluent neighborhood that features the homes built by wealthy San Franciscans in the wake of the 1906 earthquake . Directly north of Pacific Heights facing the waterfront is the Marina , a neighborhood popular with young professionals that was largely built on reclaimed land from the Bay . 
 In the south @-@ east quadrant of the city is the Mission District — populated in the 19th century by Californios and working @-@ class immigrants from Germany , Ireland , Italy , and Scandinavia . In the 1910s , a wave of Central American immigrants settled in the Mission and , in the 1950s , immigrants from Mexico began to predominate . In recent years , gentrification has changed the demographics of parts of the Mission from Latino , to twenty @-@ something professionals . Noe Valley to the southwest and Bernal Heights to the south are both increasingly popular among young families with children . East of the Mission is the Potrero Hill neighborhood , a mostly residential neighborhood that features sweeping views of downtown San Francisco . West of the Mission , the area historically known as Eureka Valley , now popularly called the Castro , was once a working @-@ class Scandinavian and Irish area . It has become North America 's first and best known gay village , and is now the center of gay life in the city . Located near the city 's southern border , the Excelsior District is one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in San Francisco . The predominantly African American Bayview @-@ Hunters Point in the far southeast corner of the city is one of the poorest neighborhoods and suffers from a high rate of crime , though the area has been the focus of several revitalizing and controversial urban renewal projects . 
 The construction of the Twin Peaks Tunnel in 1918 connected southwest neighborhoods to downtown via streetcar , hastening the development of West Portal , and nearby affluent Forest Hill and St. Francis Wood . Further west , stretching all the way to the Pacific Ocean and north to Golden Gate Park lies the vast Sunset District , a large middle class area with a predominantly Asian population . The northwestern quadrant of the city contains the Richmond , also a mostly middle @-@ class neighborhood north of Golden Gate Park , home to immigrants from other parts of Asia as well as many Russian and Ukrainian immigrants . Together , these areas are known as The Avenues . These two districts are each sometimes further divided into two regions : the Outer Richmond and Outer Sunset can refer to the more western portions of their respective district and the Inner Richmond and Inner Sunset can refer to the more eastern portions . 
 Many piers remained derelict for years until the demolition of the Embarcadero Freeway reopened the downtown waterfront , allowing for redevelopment . The centerpiece of the port , the Ferry Building , while still receiving commuter ferry traffic , has been restored and redeveloped as a gourmet marketplace . The port 's other activities now focus on developing waterside assets to support recreation and tourism . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 San Francisco 's climate is characteristic of the cool @-@ summer Mediterranean climate ( Csb ) of California ’ s coast , with moist mild winters and dry summers . San Francisco 's weather is strongly influenced by the cool currents of the Pacific Ocean on the west side of the city , and the water of San Francisco Bay to the north and east . Being surrounded by water moderates temperature swings and produces a remarkably mild year @-@ round climate with little seasonal temperature variation . 
 Among major U.S. cities , San Francisco has the coolest daily mean , maximum , and minimum temperatures for June , July , and August . During the summer , rising hot air in California 's interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate , which creates the city 's characteristic cool winds and fog . The fog is less pronounced in eastern neighborhoods and during the late summer and early fall , which is the warmest time of the year . 
 Because of its sharp topography and maritime influences , San Francisco exhibits a multitude of distinct microclimates . The high hills in the geographic center of the city are responsible for a 20 % variance in annual rainfall between different parts of the city . They also protect neighborhoods directly to their east from the foggy and sometimes very cold and windy conditions experienced in the Sunset District ; for those who live on the eastern side of the city , San Francisco is sunnier , with an average of 260 clear days , and only 105 cloudy days per year . 
 Temperatures reach or exceed 80 ° F ( 27 ° C ) on an average of only 21 and 23 days a year at downtown and San Francisco International Airport ( SFO ) , respectively . The dry period of May to October is mild to warm , with the normal monthly mean temperature peaking in September at 62 @.@ 7 ° F ( 17 @.@ 1 ° C ) . The rainy period of November to April is slightly cooler , with the normal monthly mean temperature reaching its lowest in January at 51 @.@ 3 ° F ( 10 @.@ 7 ° C ) . On average , there are 73 rainy days a year , and annual precipitation averages 23 @.@ 65 inches ( 601 mm ) . Variation in precipitation from year to year is high . Above average rain years are often associated with warm El Niño conditions in the Pacific while dry years often occur in cold water La Niña periods . In 2013 ( a " La Niña " year ) , a record low 5 @.@ 59 in ( 142 mm ) of rainfall was recorded at downtown San Francisco , where records have been kept since 1849 . Snowfall in the city is very rare , with only 10 measurable accumulations recorded since 1852 , most recently in 1976 when up to 5 inches ( 130 mm ) fell on Twin Peaks . 
 The highest recorded temperature at the official National Weather Service office was 103 ° F ( 39 ° C ) on July 17 , 1988 , and June 14 , 2000 . The lowest recorded temperature was 27 ° F ( − 3 ° C ) on December 11 , 1932 .

 = = Economy = = 
 San Francisco has a diversified service economy , with employment spread across a wide range of professional services , including financial services , tourism , and ( increasingly ) high technology . In 2012 , approximately 25 % of workers were employed in professional business services ; 16 % in government services ; 15 % in leisure and hospitality ; 11 % in education and health care ; and 9 % in financial activities . In 2013 , GDP in the five @-@ county San Francisco metropolitan area was US $ 388 @.@ 3 billion . 
 The legacy of the California Gold Rush turned San Francisco into the principal banking and finance center of the West Coast in the early twentieth century . Montgomery Street in the Financial District became known as the " Wall Street of the West " , home to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco , the Wells Fargo corporate headquarters , and the site of the now @-@ defunct Pacific Coast Stock Exchange . Bank of America , a pioneer in making banking services accessible to the middle class , was founded in San Francisco and in the 1960s , built the landmark modern skyscraper at 555 California Street for its corporate headquarters . Many large financial institutions , multinational banks , and venture capital firms are based in or have regional headquarters in the city . With over 30 international financial institutions , six Fortune 500 companies , and a large support infrastructure of professional services — including law , public relations , architecture and design — San Francisco is designated as an Alpha ( - ) World City , and is ranked in 10th place among the top global financial centers . 
 Since the 1990s , San Francisco 's economy has diversified away from finance and tourism towards the growing fields of high tech , biotechnology , and medical research . Technology jobs accounted for just 1 percent of San Francisco 's economy in 1990 , growing to 4 percent in 2010 and an estimated 8 percent by the end of 2013 . San Francisco became an epicenter of Internet start @-@ up companies during the dot @-@ com bubble of the 1990s and the subsequent social media boom of the late 2000s ( decade ) . Since 2010 , San Francisco proper has attracted an increasing share of venture capital investments as compared to nearby Silicon Valley , attracting 423 <unk> worth US $ 4 @.@ 58 billion in 2013 . In 2004 , the city approved a payroll tax exemption for biotechnology companies to foster growth in the Mission Bay neighborhood , site of a second campus and hospital of the University of California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) . Mission Bay hosts the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine , California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences , and Gladstone Institutes , as well as more than 40 private @-@ sector life sciences companies . 
 The top employer in the city is the city government itself , employing 5 @.@ 3 % ( 25 @,@ 000 + people ) of the city 's population , followed by UCSF with over 22 @,@ 000 employees . Third — at 1 @.@ 8 % ( 8 @,@ 500 + people ) — is California Pacific Medical Center , the largest private @-@ sector employer . Small businesses with fewer than 10 employees and self @-@ employed firms make up 85 % of city establishments , and the number of San Franciscans employed by firms of more than 1 @,@ 000 employees has fallen by half since 1977 . The growth of national big box and formula retail chains into the city has been made intentionally difficult by political and civic consensus . In an effort to buoy small privately owned businesses in San Francisco and preserve the unique retail personality of the city , the Small Business Commission supports a publicity campaign to keep a larger share of retail dollars in the local economy , and the Board of Supervisors has used the planning code to limit the neighborhoods where formula retail establishments can set up shop , an effort affirmed by San Francisco voters . 
 Like many U.S. cities , San Francisco once had a significant manufacturing sector employing nearly 60 @,@ 000 workers in 1969 , but nearly all production left for cheaper locations by the 1980s . As of 2014 , San Francisco has seen a small resurgence in manufacturing , with more than 4 @,@ 000 manufacturing jobs across 500 companies , doubling since 2011 . The city 's largest manufacturing employer is Anchor Brewing Company , and the largest by revenue is <unk> . 
 = = = Tourism & conventions = = = 
 Tourism is one of the city 's largest private @-@ sector industries , accounting for more than one out of seven jobs in the city . The city 's frequent portrayal in music , film , and popular culture has made the city and its landmarks recognizable worldwide . It attracts the fifth @-@ highest number of foreign tourists of any city in the U.S. and is one of the 100 most visited cities worldwide according to <unk> International . More than 18 million visitors arrived in San Francisco in 2014 , injecting US $ 10 @.@ 67 billion into the economy . With a large hotel infrastructure and a world @-@ class convention facility in the Moscone Center , San Francisco is a popular destination for annual conventions and conferences . 
 The port currently uses Pier 35 to handle the 60 – 80 cruise ship calls and 200 @,@ 000 passengers that come to San Francisco . <unk> from San Francisco usually include round trip cruises to Alaska and Mexico . The new Terminal Project at Pier 27 is scheduled to open 2014 as a replacement . The existing primary terminal at Pier 35 has neither the sufficient capacity to allow for the increasing size of new cruise ships nor the amenities needed for an international cruise terminal . 
 A heightened interest in <unk> in San Francisco , marked by the establishment of convention centers such as Yerba Buena , acted as a feeder into the local tourist economy and resulted in an increase in the hotel industry : " In 1959 , the city had fewer than thirty @-@ three hundred first @-@ class hotel rooms ; by 1970 , the number was nine thousand ; and by 1999 , there were more than thirty thousand . " The commodification of the Castro District has contributed to San Francisco 's tourist economy .

 Although the Financial District , Union Square , and Fisherman 's Wharf are well @-@ known around the world , San Francisco is also characterized by its numerous culturally rich streetscapes featuring mixed @-@ use neighborhoods anchored around central commercial corridors to which residents and visitors alike can walk . Because of these characteristics , San Francisco is ranked the second " most walkable " city in the U.S. by <unk> Many neighborhoods feature a mix of businesses , restaurants and venues that cater to both the daily needs of local residents while also serving many visitors and tourists . Some neighborhoods are dotted with boutiques , cafes and nightlife such as Union Street in Cow Hollow , 24th Street in Noe Valley , Valencia Street in the Mission , Grant Avenue in North Beach , and Irving Street in the Inner Sunset . This approach especially has influenced the continuing South of Market neighborhood redevelopment with businesses and neighborhood services rising alongside high @-@ rise residences . 
 Since the 1990s , the demand for skilled information technology workers from local startups and nearby Silicon Valley has attracted white @-@ collar workers from all over the world and created a high standard of living in San Francisco . Many neighborhoods that were once blue @-@ collar , middle , and lower class have been gentrifying , as many of the city 's traditional business and industrial districts have experienced a renaissance driven by the redevelopment of the Embarcadero , including the neighborhoods South Beach and Mission Bay . The city 's property values and household income have risen to among the highest in the nation , creating a large and upscale restaurant , retail , and entertainment scene . According to a 2014 quality of life survey of global cities , San Francisco has the highest quality of living of any U.S. city . However , due to the exceptionally high cost of living , many of the city 's middle and lower @-@ class families have been leaving the city for the outer suburbs of the Bay Area , or for California 's Central Valley . By June 2 , 2015 , the median rent was reported to be as high as $ 4 @,@ 225 . The high cost of living is due in part to restrictive planning laws which limit new residential construction . 
 The international character that San Francisco has enjoyed since its founding is continued today by large numbers of immigrants from Asia and Latin America . With 39 % of its residents born overseas , San Francisco has numerous neighborhoods filled with businesses and civic institutions catering to new arrivals . In particular , the arrival of many ethnic Chinese , which accelerated beginning in the 1970s , has complemented the long @-@ established community historically based in Chinatown throughout the city and has transformed the annual Chinese New Year Parade into the largest event of its kind outside China . 
 With the arrival of the " beat " writers and artists of the 1950s and societal changes culminating in the Summer of Love in the Haight @-@ Ashbury district during the 1960s , San Francisco became a center of liberal activism and of the counterculture that arose at that time . The Democrats and to a lesser extent the Green Party have dominated city politics since the late 1970s , after the last serious Republican challenger for city office lost the 1975 mayoral election by a narrow margin . San Francisco has not voted more than 20 % for a Republican presidential or senatorial candidate since 1988 . In 2007 , the city expanded its Medicaid and other indigent medical programs into the " Healthy San Francisco " program , which subsidizes certain medical services for eligible residents . 
 San Francisco also has had a very active environmental community . Starting with the founding of the Sierra Club in 1892 to the establishment of the non @-@ profit Friends of the Urban Forest in 1981 , San Francisco has been at the forefront of many global discussions regarding our natural environment . The 1980 San Francisco Recycling Program was one of the earliest curbside recycling programs . The city 's <unk> incentive promotes solar installations and the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission is rolling out the <unk> program to sell electricity from local renewable sources . SF <unk> is a program to recycle used cooking oil for conversion to biodiesel . 
 The Sunset Reservoir Solar Project , completed in 2010 , installed 24 @,@ 000 solar panels on the roof of the reservoir . The 5 @-@ megawatt plant more than tripled the city 's 2 @-@ megawatt solar generation capacity when it opened in December 2010 .

 Due to its unique geography , and the freeway revolts of the late 1950s , San Francisco is one of the few American cities with arterial thoroughfares instead of having numerous highways within the city . 
 Interstate 80 begins at the approach to the Bay Bridge and is the only direct automobile link to the East Bay .

 = U.S. Route 24 in Michigan = 
 US Highway 24 ( US 24 ) is a United States Numbered Highway that runs from Minturn , Colorado , to Independence Township , Michigan . In Michigan , it is also known as Telegraph Road and runs for 79 @.@ 828 miles ( 128 @.@ 471 km ) as a major north – south state trunkline highway from the Ohio state line through Metro Detroit . The highway runs through three counties in southeastern Michigan , Monroe , Wayne and Oakland , as it parallels the Lake Erie shoreline and bypasses Metro Detroit on the west . Telegraph Road connects several suburbs together and passes through the western edge of Detroit before it terminates northwest of Clarkston at an interchange with Interstate 75 ( I @-@ 75 ) . 
 The northern part of the highway follows a section of an old Indian trail called the Saginaw Trail that connected Detroit with points further north . The southern sections in the Downriver area south to Monroe parallel telegraph lines from the mid @-@ 19th century . These lines gave the road its name . Later this road was added to the state highway system in the early 20th century . It was upgraded and extended during the 1920s to serve as a western bypass of Detroit . The US 24 designation was applied to the highway on November 11 , 1926 , when the United States Numbered Highway System was inaugurated . Since that time , an alternate route , Alternate US Highway 24 ( ALT US 24 ) was designated between the state line and the Gibraltar area ; this highway later became part of I @-@ 75 . In the 1970s , the northernmost section gained the US 10 designation when that highway was rerouted . That overlap was eliminated in 1986 , and US 24 was extended north to Clarkston to replace a segment of US 10 . At the same time , a business loop in Pontiac was redesignated for US 24 in addition to its connector routes it has . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Like other state highways in Michigan , US 24 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) . In 2011 , the department 's traffic surveys showed that on average , 85 @,@ 302 vehicles used the highway daily between the " Mixing Bowl " and 12 Mile Road and 6 @,@ 401 vehicles did so each day in southern Monroe County , the highest and lowest counts along the highway , respectively . All of US 24 north of I @-@ 275 is listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 US 24 crosses the Ohio state line and follows Telegraph Road northeasterly through Monroe County . The highway runs parallel to the Lake Erie shoreline , farther inland than both I @-@ 75 ( Detroit – Toledo Freeway ) or M @-@ 125 ( Dixie Highway ) . The area around the trunkline is a mixture of farm friends and clusters of houses . Luna Pier Road connects US 24 to M @-@ 125 near Erie ; this roadway is an unsigned highway called Connector US 24 ( Conn . US 24 ) that runs as a connector route between the two highways . Further north , US 24 passes to the west side of Monroe , meeting the eastern terminus of M @-@ 50 ( Custer Road ) near Custer Airport . The trunkline crosses the River Raisin near this intersection as well . North of Monroe near Stoney Creek , M @-@ 125 merges into US 24 and terminates . Further north , US 24 crosses I @-@ 275 before passing near the Flat Rock Speedway . The highway then crosses the Huron River and into Wayne County , entering the Downriver area . 
 Telegraph Road runs through downtown Flat Rock as it parallels the Lake Erie shoreline . North of the city in Brownstown Township , Telegraph Road and US 24 turn due north ; a second Conn . US 24 runs along Dix – Toledo Highway to connect US 24 to I @-@ 75 near Woodhaven . There is a third Conn . US 24 in Taylor that provides access from southbound US 24 to southbound I @-@ 75 and from northbound I @-@ 75 to northbound US 24 between a pair of interchanges near the Southland Center . Telegraph continues northward through Taylor , widening into a boulevard and gaining a median . Traffic turning left onto the road needs to perform a Michigan left maneuver to do so , and drivers changing directions along US 24 have to use the U @-@ turn crossovers in the median . From here north , the road runs through residential areas of the suburb approximately three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of Detroit Metropolitan Airport , lined with various businesses immediately adjacent to the roadway . It crosses the South Branch of the Ecorse River .

Telegraph crosses back into Dearborn Heights at the intersection with M @-@ 153 ( Ford Road ) east of St. Hedwig Cemetery . North of the cemetery , in the a section of the Middle River Rouge Park , Telegraph crosses the middle branch of that river before entering the southeastern corner of Redford Township . There is an interchange for a boulevard section of Plymouth Road before US 24 meets I @-@ 96 ( Jeffries Freeway ) on a section of the border with Detroit . 
 To the northeast of the I @-@ 96 interchange is the Elisa Howell Park as US 24 continues due north along a segment of the Detroit – Redford Township boundary . The trunkline crosses into Detroit completely north of Puritan Street . Telegraph passes through urban residential neighborhoods on the city 's far west side flanked by various municipal parkland along the River Rouge to its immediate east . US 24 eventually intersects with M @-@ 5 ( Grand River Avenue ) , one of the five principal avenues of the Detroit street plan , south of 7 Mile Road .

Between the Mixing Bowl and 12 Mile Road , Telegraph runs through a commercial district in Southfield , and north of 13 Mile Road , the highway forms part of the border between the villages of Franklin and Bingham Farms ; this area is predominantly suburban residential subdivisions . 
 At 14 Mile Road , US 24 crosses into Bloomfield Township and begins to meander between the lakes of Oakland County 's lake country . The highway turns to the northwest before crossing Square Lake Road ( 19 Mile ) south of Pontiac . Square Lake Road forms part of Business US 24 ( Bus . US 24 ) , a business loop that runs into downtown Pontiac ; Telegraph Road bypasses downtown to the southwest and west . At the interchange with Orchard Lake Road on the border between Pontiac and Sylvan Lake , US 24 turns northward along Pontiac 's western border as an undivided roadway . Telegraph intersects M @-@ 59 ( Huron Road ) on the border between Waterford Township and Pontiac . 
 North of the Summit Place Mall , Telegraph Road ends at the intersection with Dixie Highway and the northern end of Bus . US 24 ( Cesar Chavez Avenue ) .

 = = History = = 
 In 1701 , the first transportation routes through what became the state of Michigan were the lakes , rivers and Indian trails . One of these Indian trails , the Saginaw Trail followed a path from the Detroit area north to Saginaw ; this trail ran along what is now Dixie Highway from Pontiac northwards . 
 Telegraph lines were first installed from the Detroit area south to the Monroe area in the mid @-@ 19th century with additional lines north to Pontiac completed around 1868 . As these communication lines were installed , roadways were added as needed to provide access for maintenance . The parallel road from Dearborn south was named for these lines , becoming Telegraph Road . When the state initially signposted its state highways in 1919 , Telegraph Road from the Ohio state line north to Dearborn was assigned the original M @-@ 10 designation . The same year , the Dixie Highway , an auto trail that ran south from Detroit to Miami , Florida , was extended through Pontiac northward to the Straits of Mackinac . The numerical highway designation was changed to US 24 when the United States Numbered Highway System was inaugurated on November 11 , 1926 . 
 Highway traffic coming north from Toledo was forced to pass through Detroit to get to points north at the time . To ease the congestion downtown , a westerly bypass was constructed in the 1920s . Between Flat Rock and Dearborn , the upgraded highway was opened in 1922 , with an extension to Stoney Creek the following year . The new road was built north from Michigan Avenue to Grand River Avenue in 1924 . The extension to the state line was finished in 1925 , and the remainder to Dixie Highway north of Pontiac was done in 1930 . At the time , US 24 was extended north to the corner of Telegraph and Square Lake roads , with M @-@ 58 routed along the western Pontiac bypass . The highway was widened into a multi @-@ lane highway starting in 1936 . 
 By 1945 , a divided highway designated Alternate US 24 ( ALT US 24 ) was opened from the state line north to Erie . This divided highway , now named the Detroit – Toledo Expressway , was extended in 1956 to Gibraltar , and the ALT US 24 designation was continued north to connect back to the mainline near Woodhaven . The former connection near Erie became a connector route , now part of Conn . US 24 and Conn . M @-@ 125 . Additional segments of freeway were opened through 1958 , and the I @-@ 75 designation was applied to the freeway the following year , becoming the first segment of Interstate Highway so signed in Michigan . 
 Between 1960 and 1963 , the four @-@ lane undivided highway was turned into a seven- and eight @-@ lane divided highway in Wayne County . At this time , the Michigan State Highway Department , predecessor to MDOT , added median crossovers along Telegraph Road . These additions were used to eliminate left turns at intersections and shift traffic less than 350 feet ( 110 m ) away from the intersection . The distance complicated traffic flow . Later this concept was refined and used at the intersection of 8 Mile Road and Livernois Avenue , becoming the first Michigan left intersection in the state . 
 In 1970 , US 10 was moved from its routing along Woodward Avenue between Detroit and Pontiac to follow the Lodge Freeway . From the northern end of the Lodge to Square Lake Road near Pontiac , US 10 and US 24 were run concurrently along Telegraph Road . North of Square Lake Road , US 10 continued along Telegraph back to Dixie Highway as before . In 1986 , US 10 was truncated to end at Bay City instead of continuing on to Detroit . In the process , Telegraph Road lost its US 10 co @-@ designation , US 24 was extended to its current northern terminus near Clarkston and the existing Bus . US 10 in Pontiac was redesignated to become a Bus . US 24 instead . 
 The interchange with I @-@ 94 had only two bridges and left hand exits were used throughout . This interchange was reconfigured in 2005 to a SPUI design that was completed in December of that year . A pair of bridges called the Gateway Bridge ( alternately " Gateway to Detroit " ) was incorporated in the new interchange . 
 On November 30 , 2005 , President George W. Bush signed the 2006 appropriations bill related to the US Department of Transportation and other agencies . Contained in that law was a provision that named a 30 @-@ mile ( 48 km ) stretch of US 24 from I @-@ 96 to its northern end at I @-@ 75 the " Max M. Fisher Memorial Highway " ; the highway was dedicated in May 2008 . In June 2012 , Governor Rick Snyder signed a bill from the Michigan Legislature that designated a section of Telegraph Road in Taylor for Cpl. Matthew Edwards , a member of the Taylor Police Department that was killed in the line of duty .

 = 1916 Irondale earthquake = 
 The 1916 Irondale earthquake struck north – central Alabama on October 18 . The greatest earthquake in state history , it registered an estimated magnitude of 5 @.@ 1 on the Richter magnitude scale and resulted in extensive minor damage . Damage , limited to Shelby and Jefferson counties , reached its maximum severity near the epicenter in the city of Irondale , including cracked windows , fallen chimneys , and dried @-@ up wells . While there were no fatalities , the earthquake spawned widespread panic , sending alarmed workers from tall buildings . 
 The earthquake originated in the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone , a fault noted for earthquakes of moderate magnitude . Faulting in the area is strike @-@ slip @-@ oriented probably because of the Alabama @-@ New York Lineament , which runs adjacent to the fault . Several scientists believe that the small earthquakes from the zone highlight the reactivation of deep , ancient faults . Alabama has seen roughly 20 earthquakes since the beginning of the 20th century . The earthquakes have been moderate , never reaching above magnitude 5 @.@ 1 , and tend to cause damage only near their epicenters while reaching areas much further away . Major events include those in 1916 , 1997 , and 2003 . Despite the lack of powerful seismic events in Alabama , earthquakes from nearby fault zones , including the New Madrid Seismic Zone , pose a serious threat to infrastructure . Even an earthquake similar in size to the 1916 Irondale event today could damage thousands of buildings and cause up to $ 1 billion in damage .

 <unk> in the south – central United States is moderately powerful . The energy from a mid @-@ continent earthquake extends over as much as ten times area of a similarly sized earthquake in the western United States . A magnitude 4 @.@ 0 earthquake west of the Rocky Mountains reaches up to 60 miles ( 97 km ) from its epicenter , while a magnitude 5 @.@ 5 earthquake in the eastern US can be felt 300 miles ( 483 km ) from its epicenter . Science failed to explain the phenomena until 1978 , when geologists discovered a massive fault line running from the middle of the continent to its eastern coast . More recent magnetic surveys show that the structure is a 500 @-@ million year @-@ old strike @-@ slip fault , which starts under the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone and runs to the eastern coast . This corresponds to the strike @-@ slip faulting exhibited in the Eastern Tennessee Zone , and explains the presence of mid @-@ continent earthquakes in the United States . Still , it is not clear if the fault is definitely related to mid @-@ continental seismicity . 
 = = = Local = = = 
 Earthquakes in Alabama are sporadic , and tend to cause little to no damage . During a 91 @-@ year period , there were 19 earthquakes , varying from near @-@ imperceptible to damaging . The first known activity in Alabama , the New Madrid earthquakes of 1812 , registered Mercalli intensities of VII ( Very strong ) throughout the northern and central portions of the state . On February 4 , 1886 , the first recorded earthquake from Alabama hit the western part of the state , jolting people in Sumter and Marengo counties . 
 Following minor events in 1917 , 1927 , 1931 , and 1939 , threatening activity resumed in the late 1950s , when , in 1957 , an earthquake near Birmingham extended from northern Alabama to Georgia and Tennessee , cracking and displacing small objects . A 1959 event in Huntsville , although smaller , damaged chimneys , wrecked plaster , and threw objects from shelves and tables . More recently , events occurred in Escambia County in 1997 and in 2003 in Fort Payne , registering magnitudes of 4 @.@ 9 and spawning shaking . The Fort Payne earthquake spread over 13 states and wrought structural cracks . 
 = = Geology = = 
 While earthquakes have taken place throughout Alabama , the northern part of the state is associated with the greatest amount of earthquakes because it lies near the Appalachian Mountains . Three major fault zones lie near Alabama : the New Madrid , Eastern Tennessee , and South Carolina seismic zones . 
 The New Madrid Seismic Zone ( <unk> ) lies particularly close and has produced large earthquakes , such as those in 1811 and 1812 . Because the fault zone lies in a densely populated area , a major earthquake from the zone could be catastrophic . The Geological Survey of Alabama predicts a 90 percent chance of an earthquake of 6 @.@ 0 or greater in the area by 2040 . The shaking from such an earthquake would spread again into the northern segment of Alabama . The Southern Appalachian system , which extends into Alabama , poses a moderate threat to eastern and central Alabama and is responsible for most of the state 's earthquakes . The South Carolina seismic zone has produced earthquakes as powerful as 7 @.@ 3 on the Richter scale , and a large earthquake originating from it could easily reach Alabama . The 1886 Charleston earthquake , for example , was felt as far as 750 miles ( 1 @,@ 207 km ) from its epicenter . Another more recently active zone in eastern Tennessee has produced small earthquakes , including one in Alabama in 1997 . 
 The earthquake originated in the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone , among the most active seismic areas in the Southeastern United States and one capable of producing moderately strong earthquakes , a few of which have caused damage . The frequency for non @-@ damaging earthquakes from this zone measures out to about one per year , and it has produced many faint earthquakes recorded on seismographs . Such earthquakes have been helpful in highlighting the activity of faults below the Paleozoic detachment . Fault @-@ plane solutions of multiple earthquakes throughout the area confirmed strike @-@ slip faulting between two steeply declining planes . Both right and left @-@ lateral movement occurs in the area , most movement being associated with north @-@ to @-@ south planes ( right @-@ lateral ) and east @-@ to @-@ west planes ( left @-@ lateral ) . All of these mechanisms indicate reactivation of basement faults below more @-@ recent faults . These basement faults probably converge on one another , and one being strong and the other being weak , produce earthquakes . 
 Near its epicenter , the 1916 Irondale earthquake produced intensities measuring VI ( Strong ) and VII ( Very strong ) on the Mercalli intensity scale . Further away , its intensities ranged from III ( Weak ) to IV ( Light ) . 
 = = Damage = = 
 The earthquake originated near the city of Irondale , 3 miles ( 5 km ) north of Birmingham , striking just after 4 P.M. local time . Because the earthquake took place before Alabama had a seismograph network , its Richter scale magnitude of 5 @.@ 1 is an estimate , but it is still considered the most powerful earthquake in state history , affecting seven other states . 
 Although there were no deaths , structural damage , including cracked windows , occurred . The most serious damage was in Irondale , where chimneys were toppled . In a two @-@ block area , shaking wrecked fourteen chimneys , including six chimneys at one brick store which collapsed . Throughout the city , oscillation collapsed many other chimneys or damaged them beyond repair . In other cities , chimneys lost bricks and light damage occurred . In Birmingham , a few " poorly built " chimneys sustained damage . Other damage reports included extensive damage to wells ; five wells in Irondale were cut off from their underground supplies . Lower water levels were common in both Irondale and Pell City , where one well was lowered by as much as 12 inches ( 305 mm ) . 
 In Birmingham , the shaking prompted the evacuation of office buildings . A news article at the time reported that " The sensation on the upper floors of buildings was similar to that of standing on the deck of a vessel in a slight sea . There was the slight pitch , with the suggestion of a roll " . 
 = = Threat = = 
 The United States Geological Survey at the Center for Earthquake Research and Information ( <unk> ) at the University of Memphis , along with a seismic station in Birmingham which is part of the Advanced National Seismic System facilitate monitoring of inter @-@ state earthquakes , which tend to be moderate and often originate in the <unk> and other , smaller fault zones . 
 Andrew <unk> , a professor of geological sciences at the University of Alabama , believes the state is at " high " risk from earthquakes . He claims that " If there is an earthquake in one of the zone areas , North Alabama is certainly going to feel it . There 's going to be damage and some perhaps major . If one occurred in the zone close to Memphis , it would be devastating because buildings are not made to withstand earthquakes . Places like San Francisco are aware of earthquake risks and structures are built to withstand them . " By his definition , the state 's earthquakes are " insignificant " . Emergency planner Bill <unk> feels skeptical about a major earthquake , stating , " I don 't believe there are any major faults ( interface of rocks ) here . It depends on the magnitude of the earthquake and the Richter scale . You could have a No. 4 ( magnitude ) earthquake in California and not damage anything , but the same type in New York could be devastating because the building codes don 't factor in earthquakes . " 
 The impact of the 1916 earthquake was minor , but if a similarly sized earthquake were to occur , damage could be extensive . A 2007 United States Geological Survey study estimates that up to $ 1 billion in damage might result should a fairly powerful earthquake occur in a heavily populated area . Considering building codes , soil types , and population numbers from the 2000 United States Census , it estimates 26 buildings destroyed , 3 @,@ 300 structures damaged , and several deaths . 
 = Wizards & Warriors III : Kuros : Visions of Power = 
 Wizards & Warriors III : Kuros : Visions of Power is a platforming and adventure video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) . It was developed by UK @-@ based company Zippo Games for Rare ; it was published by Acclaim and released in North America in March 1992 and in Europe on January 21 , 1993 . It is the third and final installment in the Wizards & Warriors series and is the sequel to the 1989 title Ironsword : Wizards & Warriors II . The game picks up immediately from the events at the end of Ironsword where the knight warrior Kuros had just defeated the evil wizard Malkil from the peak of IceFire Mountain . Unaware that Malkil 's spirit is still intact , Kuros gets struck by a bolt of magic from the spirit , causing him to lose his armor , memory , and honor . Malkil then flees to the city of Piedup and seizes the throne from Good King James . Meanwhile , Kuros , after wandering for months in the wilderness without weapons , armor , or food , arrives at the city of Piedup , where he must build strength and utilize various disguises and abilities in order to take on Malkil . The game is nonlinear and requires players to explore various areas to pick up items and gain abilities to unlock different parts of the city in order to progress . 
 Wizards & Warriors III was developed by Zippo Games ' founders Ste and John Pickford , who also had a few additional programmers and artists to assist them . The Pickford brothers designed the game as a homage to Ultimate Play the Game 's ( Rare 's former incarnation ) 1983 ZX Spectrum title Atic Atac ; they also drew inspiration for gameplay and art from other NES titles such as Metroid , Faxanadu , and Super Mario Bros. 3 . The game had moderate sales , though not as good as its predecessor Ironsword . It was praised for its bold graphics , expansive gameplay , and challenge . However , it was mostly criticized for its controls , lack of fighting , and the lack of continues or passwords . While the game received mixed reviews , Ste Pickford said that this game was his personal favorite . Zippo Games , which was acquired by Rare and was known as Rare Manchester during development , shut down shortly before this game 's completion , and while the game hinted at another sequel , it has never occurred .

 Wizards & Warriors III : Kuros : Visions of Power takes place immediately after the events at the end of the previous game , Ironsword : Wizards & Warriors II , when Kuros has defeated his nemesis , the evil wizard Malkil , on the peak of IceFire Mountain . Unaware that Malkil 's spirit has survived , Kuros is struck by a bolt of magic from the spirit , knocking him out and removing his armor , memory , and honor . A weakened Malkil then flees and takes refuge in the peaceful city of Piedup , where he dethrones Good King James and takes control of the city . Meanwhile , Kuros has been left to wander in the wilderness without any weapons , armor , or food . After wandering for several months , he finally reaches the city of Piedup , where Malkil 's spirit lies . While in the city , Kuros assumes several disguises of wizard , knight , and thief , in order to travel through town undetected and build strength and skill , rescue damsels , and prepare for his battle with Malkil . 
 Eventually , Kuros makes his way to the throne room in the castle of Piedup . After freeing Good King James , Kuros encounters Malkil , who offers his partnership to Kuros , saying that they would only destroy each other and that they could rule the world if they joined together . Players are then given the option of choosing " yes " or " no " . If the player chooses " yes " , Malkil then shoots Kuros in the back with magic and instantly defeats him while saying : " Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! The Fool ! ! " Malkil then holds Kuros prisoner , and the game ends . If the player chooses " no " , then the final battle commences ; after Kuros defeats Malkil , Kuros is then sucked into a time portal , sending him into the future . The game then concludes , saying that Kuros has restored the city of Piedup to its former self , that the damsels have been saved , and that Good King James has taken back his throne ; Kuros ' legend is then immortalized among the people , as his saga " unfurls like a glorious banner " . The game concludes by saying that , while Malkil will return , Kuros will be there to defeat him repeatedly , and according to the game , " the light shall reign until the end of time " . The game 's ending sets the stage for a sequel , but no sequel for the game was ever released .

Throughout the game , players find money which can be used to buy items from inns located throughout Piedup ; players can buy keys for unlocking doors , food and drink for restoring health , and information from shopkeepers . Players begin the game with three lives , and the game ends when all lives have been lost ; unlike the previous Wizards & Warriors games , there is no password or continue feature . 
 Kuros ' first objective is to gain new disguises , powers , and abilities from the three main character classes : knight , thief , and wizard . In order to do that , Kuros must first collect bronze , silver , and gold statues of each character class and return each statue to its corresponding " guild " . Upon returning a statue to a guild , Kuros must pass a test - in the form of a horizontal or vertical @-@ scrolling level with a boss to defeat at the end - from the person who runs the guild . After defeating the boss , Kuros is then outfitted with a new attire and ability . Each character class has three levels , and each corresponds to a specific statue which must be returned to a specific guild . For example , if Kuros find the bronze thief statue , he must return it to the first level of the thief 's guild ; if Kuros passes the test , he then receives the disguise and ability of a " level one thief " . At the levels of the guild increase , the more difficult the tests become . Each new ability allows players to access new areas which would normally be unreachable with other character classes and abilities . New abilities include improved weaponry for the knight , greater magic for the wizard , and increased access to buildings through doors and windows for the thief . 
 Another objective to finding and defeating Malkil in Wizards & Warriors III is to find four secret gems which will unlock the hidden passage through the town of Piedup to the castle 's throne room where the evil wizard is located . To do this , Kuros must rescue King James ' three princesses who are hidden somewhere in Piedup ; each of them will grant Kuros a gem and agree to marry him when rescued . The final gem is obtained by defeating a dragon in the town 's underworld . 
 = = Development = = 
 Development of Wizards & Warriors III : Kuros : Visions of Power started in 1990 , when , after strong sales with Ironsword : Wizards & Warriors II , Rare gave Zippo Games the rights to develop and direct the third installment in the series ; the company 's founders , Ste and John Pickford , co @-@ designed the game . Ste Pickford was the lead artist and designed all the concept art for the game , while Lyndon Brooke also assisted with some of the drawings , and Steve Hughes and Andy <unk> wrote the software . The game was originally titled <unk> , which was the name of the development project . The Pickford brothers came up with the concept of Kuros ' disguises of knight , wizard , and thief as a homage to Ultimate Play the Game 's ( Rare 's former incarnation ) 1983 ZX Spectrum title Atic Atac . Ste Pickford said that designing a game which consisted of multiple characters , guilds , and secrets " was a dream come true at the time " , saying that they wanted to pay tribute to the various Ultimate Play the Game titles they played in the early 1980s . Pickford wanted to design a game that was a step forward from most Action RPGs for the NES ; he opted for nonlinear gameplay in which the different disguises and accompanying abilities would allow the player to access new areas of the map . " Wizards & Warriors III was more like a game that I really wanted to make . " Pickford said . 
 As with Zippo Games ' previous projects , the concept art was drawn on paper . The graphics were then drawn with Deluxe Paint and then translated into the ROM manually , sprite @-@ by @-@ sprite , as the NES hardware required precision in sprite placements ; this was different from what Rare did , which was to place each pixel of the graphics sprites on graph paper with marker pens and then tasked people to type the code into the ROM . Ste Pickford said that while Rare 's sprite @-@ drawing method was easier , his method , while time @-@ consuming , was more efficient . Most everything from the previous Wizards & Warriors games were removed , except for the main protagonist , Kuros , and the game 's main antagonist , Malkil . The concept art was originally drawn in black and white , even though the games were being designed in color , to save money from photocopying or printing in color - both of which were very expensive at the time . In developing the " Demon " mini @-@ boss , Pickford could only use about three animation frames , as the sprite was large for the NES hardware . Pickford designed the " Worm " boss similar to the bosses found in R @-@ Type , where a series of smaller sprites formed a snake or worm @-@ like enemy ; however , he commented that " it ended up in the game more like a giant floating head " . Pickford drew inspiration from the thrones in Super Mario Bros. 3 in designing the final boss , Malkil . 
 However , near the end of development , time constraints led the Pickford brothers to sell Zippo Games to Rare , in which Zippo was renamed Rare Manchester . With Rare as their boss , morale dropped for the development staff , and eventually everyone left the company before the game could be completed , thus shutting Rare Manchester down . According to Ste Pickford : " One of the programmers completed the game himself after the studio closed . " Pickford included a cover , which consisted of a knight in a light @-@ blue armor , in which he said " was just something I drew for fun " . However , when the final version of the game was sent to Rare for approval after the studio 's closing , they threw away the cover and added their own . According to Pickford , " The document came back with about two typos fixed , a new cover , and ' revised by Tim Stamper ' in big letters on the title page , with all trace of myself or any of the Zippo Games names removed , so I guess Tim had a major role . " The game was published by Acclaim Entertainment and released in North America in March 1992 and in Europe on January 21 , 1993 . 
 The Pickford brothers included a couple of easter egg references . One of them revolved around the name of one of the tavern keepers , Newton N. Ridley , which is a play off the brewery Newton and Ridley from the British soap opera Coronation Street . Another easter egg reference was made to Dragon Warrior with regards to the princesses Kuros must save during the game . Upon saving a princess , she asks Kuros to marry her , prompting a yes / no response for the player ; if the player selects " no " , the princess responds with " If you refuse , my heart will surely break ! " and prompts the yes / no response again - similar to the " but thou must " response in Dragon Warrior . In addition , as all three princesses will have committed to marrying all three forms of Kuros , the original plan for the game 's ending was for the three princesses to come together and see their heroes whom they were going to marry , only to find out all three princesses promised to marry the same person . To rectify the situation , Pickford called for what he referred to as " the ultimate cheapo cop @-@ out " , where a UFO abducts Kuros with a teleport beam , sending him into the future and setting the stage for the next sequel which would have been called <unk> . However , this never came to be .

 Wizards & Warriors III received preview coverage in the November 1991 issue of Nintendo Power . There , the magazine praised the graphics as being " eye @-@ grabbers " , saying that " Rare has a knack for bold , colorful graphics " . They also lauded the game 's expansiveness and challenge . However , a couple months later , they announced that the game 's release was delayed . The game would eventually receive a rating in its " George & Rob 's Now Playing " review section in its April 1992 issue , but it did not receive a review . 
 Wizards & Warriors III : Kuros : Visions of Power sold 300 @,@ 000 copies in North America and 30 @,@ 000 copies in Europe , according to company figures . It was also one of the featured reviews in the February 1992 issue of GamePro magazine . There , reviewer " Slasher Quan " compared the controls to the previous Wizards & Warriors titles , saying that Kuros " is hard @-@ to @-@ control in certain instances , but it 's still razor sharp " . His criticisms of the game included frustrating item @-@ tracking due to the game 's nonlinear structure , lack of fighting , and the lack of continues or passwords ; he added that , with regard to the lack of continues or passwords , that " this is particularly a shame because Acclaim reports this baby 's about twice as long as Ironsword " . Overall , he said that Wizards & Warriors III was " slightly blurry compared to its predecessors " . 
 In a retrospective review of the game in 2008 , Destructoid 's Conrad Zimmerman criticized Wizards & Warriors III for many issues . While he initially praised the game for its depth , he criticized the game by comparing Kuros to the previous games in the series , saying that he is " still a good @-@ looking knight with a useless sword which he holds as if it were his manhood when jumping " and adding that he " is still one of the most inept fighters in videogame history " . He also criticizes the game for its lack of action and fighting , saying that it is " more of a platforming game with the occasional boss fight " . Other criticisms include slow and unresponsive controls and hard @-@ to @-@ defeat bosses . Overall , he says that Wizards & Warriors III " isn 't a bad game , just one that has some great ideas hampered by serious flaws " . 
 Wizards & Warriors III received praise from Retro Gamer magazine in September 2010 , as part of its retrospective on the Wizards & Warriors series . They said that the third installment was the best game in the series as well as developer Ste Pickford 's personal favorite , despite the fact that it did not sell as well as its predecessor Ironsword . Developer Ste Pickford said : " Wizards & Warriors III was more like a game that I really wanted to make . IronSword was pretty much a straight sequel for a game dropped in our lap ; we look at it and tried to make a new version with some improvements . " Pickford added that , while he could have done better with both Ironsword and Wizards & Warriors III , he wished he would have been able to see the latter to its completion . 
 While Wizards & Warriors III hinted at a sequel at the end of the game , it has not happened . The publishing rights for the series remained with Acclaim , who went bankrupt in 2004 , with their intellectual property rights going to Throwback Entertainment . As of late 2010 , the Toronto @-@ based company has no plans for any future games in the series .

 " And the Rockets Dead Glare " is the seventh episode of the first season of the American police drama television series Homicide : Life on the Street . It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 17 , 1993 . In the episode , Howard testifies in a murder trial , Pembleton is offered a promotion , and Lewis and Crosetti go to the Chinese Embassy in Washington , D.C. to investigate a political refugee 's murder . 
 The teleplay was written by Jorge Zamacona based on a story by executive producer Tom Fontana , and the episode was directed by Peter Markle . It marked the first appearances of two recurring characters : defense attorney Darin Russom ( Michael Willis ) and Detective Frank Pembleton 's wife Mary , who was played by actor Andre Braugher 's real @-@ life wife Ami Brabson . The episode also featured a guest performance by actress and future model Bai Ling . 
 The murder trial portrayed in the episode is based on a trial featured in David Simon 's 1991 non @-@ fiction book , Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets , on which the series was based . Howard 's procedural missteps , and her subsequent recovery , was based on that real @-@ life trial . The writers sought to realistically portray the trial scenes by focusing on less dramatic courtroom elements . Some of the detectives in " And the Rockets ' Dead Glare " make arguments for drug liberalization , particularly John Munch , whose arguments were inspired by actor Richard Belzer 's real @-@ life personal history with drug abuse . 
 Since ratings for Homicide had gradually declined throughout the season , NBC announced a decision about whether the series would be renewed would depend on the Nielsen ratings of the final four episodes , including " And the Rockets ' Dead Glare " . Nevertheless , it was seen by a relatively low 6 @.@ 61 million household viewers , a decline from the previous week 's " A Dog and Pony Show " .

 Lewis ( Clark Johnson ) and Crosetti investigate the execution @-@ style shooting death of a Chinese college student . A friend in his dormitory ( Bai Ling ) says the victim was a student leader at the Tiananmen Square protest and had been hunted ever since . The detectives go to Washington , D.C. to talk to the Chinese embassy about the murder , but they deny any knowledge of the incident . Secret Service agent Gruszynski ( Ed Lauter ) confronts Lewis and Crosetti and tells them not to waste the embassy 's time , but agrees to give the detectives a tour of Washington before they go . Crosetti is excited to see the landmarks but Lewis , who believes the Secret Service agent knows who committed the murder , remains confrontational with Gruszynski . When Gruszynski still refuses to help , Crosetti and a frustrated Lewis leave Washington . 
 Felton ( Daniel Baldwin ) and Howard ( Melissa Leo ) prepare to testify in the murder trial of " Pony " Johnson ( Geoffrey C. Ewing ) . State prosecutor Danvers ( Željko Ivanek ) tells an anxious Howard that the case depends entirely on her testimony . Felton , who in contrast to Howard is very relaxed , claims Howard is in love with Danvers , which she vehemently denies . Howard testifies , but nervously fumbles facts and allows defense attorney Darin Russom ( Michael Willis ) to create reasonable doubt to the jury . After receiving reassurance from Danvers , however , Howard is recalled and performs much better , seriously damaging Russom 's case . Johnson is found guilty of murder and Danvers offers to buy Howard dinner , which she accepts much to Felton 's amusement . 
 Munch ( Richard Belzer ) and Bolander ( Ned Beatty ) respond to a corpse found in the woods , next to a van full of low @-@ quality marijuana . Munch proves to be an expert on hemp , and discusses how the plant was grown by founding fathers Thomas Jefferson and George Washington . The detectives eventually identify the victim as a middle man for a drug dealer , and Bolander finds a neighbor who saw Jones holding a gun to the victim 's head the night before the murder . Munch , Bayliss ( Kyle Secor ) and narcotics detective Russ <unk> ( Steven Marcus ) debate whether drugs should be illegal ; the homicide detectives claim legalization would reduce violent crime and that drug revenue could go to good causes . Bolander asks Munch if he smokes pot , but he refuses to answer . That night , Munch and Bolander arrest the drug dealer at home . 
 Captain Barnfather ( Clayton LeBouef ) and Colonel Granger ( Gerald F. Gough ) offer Pembleton ( Andre Braugher ) a promotion to lieutenant and the vacant shift commander position working alongside Gee ( Yaphet Kotto ) . Pembleton asks for time to consider it , and the duo ask him not to mention the offer to Gee . Gee is inquisitive and immediately senses Pembleton is lying when he says the discussion was nothing . After discussing the offer with his wife Mary ( Ami Brabson ) , Pembleton decides not to take the job and confesses to Gee , who has already learned the truth and is disappointed Pembleton did not tell him sooner . The episode ends with Pembleton going to the bar with his fellow detectives , which he seldom does .

 " And the Rockets Dead Glare " was written by Jorge Zamacona based on a story by executive producer Tom Fontana , and was directed by Peter Markle . It marked the first appearances of defense attorney Darin Russom ( Michael Willis ) and Frank Pembleton 's wife Mary , both of whom became recurring characters throughout the rest of the series . Mary Pembleton is played by Ami Brabson , who is married to actor Andre Braugher in real life . Brabson auditioned for the role shortly after Braugher was cast in the series , and Braugher said of their on @-@ screen pairing , " We have an instant rapport that we don 't have to create . " Willis , in real life , has a low opinion of trial lawyers , and did little to research for his role as Russom . " And the Rockets ' Dead Glare " also featured a guest appearance by actress and model Bai Ling , a student and apparent friend to the Chinese refugee murdered in the episode . Although relatively unknown at the time , Ling went on to star in such films as Red Corner ( 1997 ) and Anna and the King ( 1999 ) , and was named one of People Magazine 's " 50 Most Beautiful People in the World " in 1998 . 
 The " Pony " Johnson murder trial is based on a real @-@ life trial featured in Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets , the 1991 David Simon non @-@ fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department , which was adapted into the Homicide series . In that real @-@ life trial , a Baltimore detective <unk> during his testimony and nearly jeopardizes the outcome of the case . This is mirrored by the actions of Kay Howard , who accidentally says the victim was dead at least 24 hours when she meant to say 12 hours , leaving an opening for defense attorney Darin Russom to question her recollection and expertise . The defense attorney in the real @-@ life trial lost the case for himself with a procedural misstep similar to the one portrayed in " And the Rockets Dead Glare " . In the episode , Russom asks Howard whether she had ever seen a murder victim killed by both a knife and a gun . This allows Howard to mention a second victim police suspect " Pony " Johnson murdered , which she would not have been allowed to mention had Russom not asked her . Homicide filmmakers sought to portray the trial scenes in a far more realistic light than most police drama shows , particularly with the inclusion of less dramatic courtroom elements such as Howard 's waiting anxiously to testify and the awkward pauses during her testimony . 
 " And the Rockets ' Dead Glare " presents a case for drug liberalization , arguing from the perspectives of homicide detectives Tim Bayliss and , particularly , John Munch that legalizing drugs would help curb violent crime . Munch 's pro @-@ drug liberalization comments in the episode were inspired by actor Richard Belzer 's real @-@ life personal history with drug abuse and drug dealing , which would go on to inspire further development of Munch 's druggie and hippie past in future episodes . An arrangement of Frédéric Chopin 's Fantaisie @-@ Impromptu in C Minor , conducted by Louis <unk> , appears in " And the Rockets Dead Glare " , as does the song " Rhythm and Blues " by Benjamin Antin .

 = Royal Blue ( train ) = 
 The Royal Blue was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ( B & O ) ' s flagship passenger train between New York City and Washington , D.C. , in the United States , beginning in 1890 . The Baltimore @-@ based B & O also used the name between 1890 and 1917 for its improved passenger service between New York and Washington launched in the 1890s , collectively dubbed the Royal Blue Line . Using variants such as the Royal Limited and Royal Special for individual Royal Blue trains , the B & O operated the service in partnership with the Reading Railroad and the Central Railroad of New Jersey . Principal intermediate cities served were Philadelphia , Wilmington , and Baltimore . Later , as Europe reeled from the carnage of World War I and connotations of European royalty fell into disfavor , the B & O discreetly omitted the sobriquet Royal Blue Line from its New York passenger service and the Royal Blue disappeared from B & O timetables . Beginning in 1917 , former Royal Blue Line trains were renamed : the Royal Limited ( inaugurated on May 15 , 1898 ) , for example , became the National Limited , continuing west from Washington to St. Louis via Cincinnati . During the Depression , the B & O hearkened back to the halcyon pre @-@ World War I era when it launched a re @-@ christened Royal Blue train between New York and Washington in 1935 . The B & O finally discontinued passenger service north of Baltimore on April 26 , 1958 , and the Royal Blue faded into history . 
 Railroad historian Herbert Harwood said , in his seminal history of the service , " First conceived in late Victorian times to promote a new railroad line ... it was indeed one of the most memorable images in the transportation business , an inspired blend of majesty and mystique ... Royal Blue Line ... Royal Blue Trains ... the Royal Blue all meant different things at different times . But essentially they all symbolized one thing : the B & O 's regal route . " Between the 1890s and World War I , the B & O 's six daily Royal Blue trains providing service between New York and Washington were noted for their luxury , elegant appearance , and speed . The car interiors were paneled in mahogany , had fully enclosed vestibules ( instead of open platforms , still widely in use at the time on U.S. railroads ) , then @-@ modern heating and lighting , and leaded glass windows . The car exteriors were painted a deep " Royal Saxony blue " color with gold leaf trim . 
 The B & O 's use of electrification instead of steam power in a Baltimore tunnel on the Royal Blue Line , beginning in 1895 , marked the first use of electric locomotives by an American railroad and presaged the dawn of practical alternatives to steam power in the 20th century . Spurred by intense competition from the formidable Pennsylvania Railroad , the dominant railroad in the lucrative New York – Washington market since the 1880s , the Royal Blue in its mid @-@ 1930s reincarnation was noted for a number of technological innovations , including streamlining and the first non @-@ articulated diesel locomotive on a passenger train in the U.S. , a harbinger of the steam locomotive 's eventual demise . 
 = = History = =

 Prior to 1884 , the B & O and the Philadelphia @-@ based Pennsylvania Railroad both used the independent Philadelphia , Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad ( PW & B ) between Baltimore , Maryland , and Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , for their New York – Washington freight and passenger trains . In 1881 , the Pennsylvania Railroad purchased a controlling interest in the PW & B , and in 1884 it denied the B & O further use of the PW & B to reach Philadelphia . 
 The B & O then built a new line from Baltimore to connect to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad in Philadelphia , completed in 1886 . The B & O 's passenger trains then used the Reading 's tracks northward from Philadelphia to Bound Brook , New Jersey , where the Jersey Central 's rails were used to reach the Communipaw Terminal in Jersey City connecting to ferry for a twelve @-@ minute crossing of the Hudson River to Manhattan . 
 The new route presented problems in Baltimore , because a ferry boat was necessary to cross the harbor between Locust Point and Canton to connect with the B & O 's Washington Branch . The solution was the Baltimore Belt Line , which included a 1 @.@ 4 @-@ mile ( 2 @.@ 3 km ) long tunnel under Howard Street in downtown Baltimore . Work began on the tunnel in 1891 and was completed on May 1 , 1895 , when the first train traversed the tunnel . To avoid smoke problems from steam engines working upgrade in the long tunnel under the middle of Baltimore , the B & O pioneered the first mainline electrification of a U.S. railroad , installing an overhead third rail system in the tunnel and its approaches . An electric locomotive first pulled a Royal Blue train through the Howard Street tunnel on June 27 , 1895 . 
 The project also included the construction of B & O 's second passenger terminal in Baltimore , Mount Royal Station , at the north end of the Howard Street tunnel in the fashionable Bolton Hill neighborhood . Designed by Baltimore architect E. Francis Baldwin in a blend of modified Romanesque and Renaissance styling , the station was built of Maryland granite trimmed with Indiana limestone , with a red tile roof and landmark 150 @-@ foot ( 46 m ) clocktower . The station 's interior featured marble mosaic flooring , a fireplace , and rocking chairs . It opened the following year on September 1 , 1896 . " It was considered , " said the Baltimore Sun , " the most splendid station in the country built and used by only one railroad . " That evaluation was shared by railroad historian Lucius Beebe , who proclaimed Mount Royal " one of the celebrated railroad stations of the world , ranking in renown with Euston Station , London , scene of so many of Sherlock Holmes ' departures , the Gare du Nord in Paris , and the feudal fortress of the Pennsylvania [ Railroad ] at Broad Street , Philadelphia " . 
 Even before the Baltimore Belt Line project was finished , the B & O launched its Royal Blue service on July 31 , 1890 . Powered by 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 steam locomotives having exceptionally large 78 @-@ inch ( 198 cm ) diameter driving wheels for speed , the Royal Blue trains occasionally reached 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) . After the Baltimore Belt Line project was completed , travel time between New York and Washington was reduced to five hours , compared to nine hours in the late 1860s . 
 The trains were noted for their elegance and luxury . The parlor cars ' ceilings and upholstery were covered in royal blue , and the dining cars Queen and Waldorf , panelled in mahogany , featured elaborate cuisine such as terrapin and <unk> prepared by French @-@ trained chefs . A Railway Age magazine article of the time reporting on the Royal Blue called it " the climax in railway car building " .

 As a result of the U.S. entry into World War I and resulting congestion on the nation 's railroads , the wartime U.S. Railroad Administration ( USRA ) ordered the Pennsylvania Railroad to permit B & O passenger trains to use its Hudson River tunnels and Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan , beginning April 28 , 1918 , eliminating the B & O 's need for the ferry connection from Jersey City . Following the end of World War I , the Pennsylvania Railroad continued to allow B & O passenger trains to use Pennsylvania Station for another eight years . On September 1 , 1926 , the Pennsylvania Railroad terminated its contract with the B & O , and the latter 's trains reverted to the use of the Jersey Central 's Jersey City terminal . Passengers were then transferred to buses that met the train right on the platform . These buses were ferried across the Hudson River into Manhattan and Brooklyn , where they proceeded to various " stations " around the city on four different routes , including the Vanderbilt Hotel , Wanamaker 's , Columbus Circle , and Rockefeller Center . B & O 's busiest Royal Blue bus terminal at 42nd street in Manhattan opened on December 17 , 1928 . Connected to Grand Central Terminal by an underground concourse , it was trimmed in marble and furnished with Art Deco lighting fixtures and leather sofas . This arrangement would continue until the eventual demise of the Royal Blue in 1958 . 
 = = = 1930s – 1940s = = = 
 As the 1930s dawned , the B & O 's New York passenger service faced two significant competitive disadvantages , compared to the Pennsylvania Railroad . First , the B & O lacked direct access to Manhattan , resulting in slower overall travel time . Second , the Pennsylvania 's move in the early 1930s to replace steam power with modern , smokeless electric service along its entire New York – Washington mainline was met with enthusiastic public approval . The B & O responded by introducing Diesel locomotives , air conditioning , and streamlining on its New York trains . On June 24 , 1935 , the B & O inaugurated the first lightweight , streamlined train in the eastern U.S. , when it began operating a re @-@ christened Royal Blue train between Washington and New York . In 1937 the B & O partially <unk> the train with locomotive # 50 , buying the first of the new E @-@ Series road Diesel locomotives from General Motors ' Electro Motive Company . Previously , early experiments with internal combustion engines to replace steam in railroad applications included short , articulated trainsets ( such as Burlington 's Pioneer Zephyr and Union Pacific 's M @-@ 10000 ) , double @-@ head sets of " <unk> " locomotives ( developed by EMC ) used to power the 1936 version of the AT & SF ( Santa Fe ) Super Chief , and the cab / booster unit combinations developed with Union Pacific 's M @-@ <unk> and M @-@ 10003 - M @-@ 10006 trainsets . The E units took the most advanced developments of Diesel locomotive technology and made them available to all operators using the consists of their choice . The earliest adopters of the new E units demonstrated the improved flexibility , efficiency and reduced maintenance costs of Diesel power in daily service compared to steam and gave impetus to the <unk> of the railroad industry . 
 Recalling the past glamor of the 1890s Royal Blue Line , the B & O introduced its Martha Washington @-@ series dining cars , which were particularly noted for their fresh Chesapeake Bay cuisine , served on Dresden china in ornate cars with glass chandeliers and colonial @-@ style furnishings . The B & O 's manager of dining car services said his department 's objective was " ... to be hospitable to our patrons in all respects – to make them feel the comfort , convenience and homelike atmosphere of our accommodations as soon as they step on our trains . " Dining car specialties included oysters and Chesapeake Bay fish served with cornmeal muffins . B & O president Daniel Willard personally sampled his dining cars ' cuisine while traveling about the line , and recognized particularly pleasing meals with letters of appreciation and autographed pictures given to the dining car chefs . 
 The B & O was not entirely satisfied with the ride quality of the lightweight Royal Blue train , however , and replaced it on April 25 , 1937 , with streamlined , refurbished heavyweight equipment , painted light gray and royal blue with gold striping , designed by Otto Kuhler . The B & O conveyed the displaced trainset to the Alton Railroad , where it ran as the Abraham Lincoln for decades . The train was pulled by the streamlined Diesel locomotive , B & O # 51 , of the 3 @,@ 600 <unk> EMC EA / EB model built by Electro Motive Company . Praised for its beauty and handsome profile , this first streamlined production model Diesel " dazzled the press and public " , said one magazine writer of the groundbreaking locomotive 's introduction . Kuhler also streamlined one of B & O 's 4 @-@ 6 @-@ 2 " Pacific " steam locomotives for use on the Royal Blue . Its bullet @-@ shaped shroud became an iconic image for the Royal Blue and was modeled for years by American Flyer . Time magazine , in reporting on the precarious financial condition of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and other Depression @-@ ravaged rail lines in 1937 , referred to the B & O 's " swashbuckling " Royal Blue streamliner launched that year as having " symbolize [ d ] the new era in railroading ... " 
 President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt was a frequent passenger on the B & O 's Royal Blue Line during his time in office ( 1933 – 1945 ) , when he traveled between Washington and his family home in Hyde Park , New York . A special presidential train from Washington used the regular B & O – Reading – Jersey Central route to Jersey City , continuing on the New York Central Railroad 's West Shore Line along the Hudson River to Highland , New York ( opposite Poughkeepsie ) , where the President was met by automobile . 
 Along with most other rail passenger services in the U.S. during World War II , the Royal Blue enjoyed a surge in passenger traffic between 1942 and 1945 as volume doubled to 1 @.@ 2 million passengers annually on B & O 's eight daily New York – Washington trains . Following the end of the war , however , passenger volumes soon dropped below prewar levels and the B & O discontinued one of its daily New York – Washington trains . In addition to its flagship Royal Blue , six other B & O passenger trains continued to serve New York until April 1958 : the Metropolitan Special , Capitol Limited , National Limited , Diplomat , Marylander , and Shenandoah . 
 = = = 1950s and the end = = = 
 Although all of B & O 's Washington – Jersey City passenger trains had been fully dieselized by September 28 , 1947 , no new passenger cars were built for the Royal Blue in the postwar period . The refurbished 8 @-@ car 1937 Royal Blue trainset continued in operation to the end . The overwhelming market dominance of the Pennsylvania Railroad was evident when it introduced the 18 @-@ car stainless steel Morning Congressional and Afternoon Congressional streamliners in 1952 . By the late 1950s , most U.S. passenger trains suffered a steep decline in patronage as the traveling public abandoned trains in favor of airplanes and automobiles , utilizing improved Interstate Highways . The Royal Blue was no exception , as operating deficits approached $ 5 million annually and passenger volume declined by almost half between 1946 and 1957 . Amidst the downward trend , the Royal Blue Line briefly recaptured the regal splendor of its early years on October 21 , 1957 , when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip travelled on the B & O from Washington to New York . 
 As financial losses mounted , the B & O finally ceded the New York – Washington market to the Pennsylvania Railroad altogether , discontinuing all passenger service north of Baltimore on Saturday , April 26 , 1958 , and bringing the venerable Royal Blue to an end . As the engineer was about to ease the locomotive 's throttle open for the Royal Blue 's final departure from Washington Union Station at 3 : 45 p.m. , the event was covered in a <unk> remote broadcast by Edward R. Murrow on a CBS network See It Now television special . The train 's 7 : 49 p.m. arrival at Jersey City Terminal was met by news reporters from The New York Times , the New York Post , Life magazine and The Saturday Evening Post , on hand to cover the legendary Royal Blue 's demise . In an editorial the next day , the Baltimore Sun lamented the end of the Royal Blue , saying it " may have been one of the most famous named trains in history " . 
 The New York Times , in a front page article accompanied by a photograph of train engineer Michael Goodnight bidding farewell to a 7 @-@ year old passenger , said " It was a sad and simple story yesterday as the nation 's oldest railroad discontinued its crack Royal Blue and its five other passenger trains ... end [ ing ] sixty @-@ eight years of continuous through service , operated in a gentlemanly fashion ... a kind of ante @-@ bellum , gracious way of life ... and the reputation for very special service . " 
 Mount Royal Station continued as the eastern terminus of B & O 's passenger service until June 30 , 1961 , when it closed permanently as a rail passenger facility . It was one of thirteen Baltimore buildings selected in 1959 for the Historic American Buildings Survey . The building and <unk> were subsequently acquired by the Maryland Institute College of Art ( MICA ) in 1964 and are preserved as examples of late 19th century industrial architecture .

 In the 1890s – 1910s period , the Royal Limited operated in both directions simultaneously , with 3 p.m. departures in New York and Washington , arriving at its destination five hours later , at 8 p.m. By the 1930s , travel time between Jersey City and Washington was reduced to four hours . From 1935 to the end of service in 1958 , the Royal Blue made a daily round trip , departing New York in the morning and returning from Washington in the evening . According to the Official Guide of February , 1956 , the Royal Blue operated on the following schedule as train # 27 ( unconditional stops highlighted in blue , bus connections in yellow ) : 
 Eastbound , the train departed Washington at 3 : 45 p.m. as train # 28 , arriving at Jersey City 7 : 40 p.m. 
 Between 1937 and 1958 , the Royal Blue was equipped with air @-@ conditioned coaches , parlor cars with private drawing rooms , a lounge car for coach passengers , a full dining car serving complete meals , and a flat @-@ end observation car with a " cafe @-@ lounge " bringing up the rear of the train . Beginning in mid @-@ August 1947 , onboard telephone service was provided , making the B & O ( along with the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central Railroad ) one of the first three railroads in the U.S. to offer telephone service on its trains , using a forerunner of cell phone technology .

Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikecei draws inspiration from a cartoon created by Deven , which originally appeared in Ananda Vikatan . Deven , who wrote the script , showed it to director S. Shankar .

Regarding the selection of Vadivelu for the roles , Deven noted that one of the royal characters from his comic book strip in Ananda Vikatan closely resembled Vadivelu , including his complexion and nativity .

 = = Themes and influences = = 
 Although Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikecei is a historical film set in the late 18th century AD , most of the issues it raises are contemporary . Topics discussed include child labour , globalisation , the bureaucratic inefficiency of government , pesticide usage in soft drinks , and divisions in the caste system . 
 In their 2010 book , Cinemas of South India : Culture , Resistance , Ideology under the section <unk> and Negotiation 23rd Imsai Arasan Pulikesi , Sowmya Dechamma C. C. , <unk> Sathya Prakash and <unk> Kalyanaraman , the soft drinks that are satirised include Coca @-@ Cola and Pepsi . The two are called Akka Mala and <unk> @-@ C respectively . They also note that Pulikecei and Ukraputhan have contrasting differences with respect to attitude towards women , education , governance , and demonstration of both skill in weaponry and physical prowess . Kalyanaraman compares Vadivelu 's balancing of both his comic and heroic abilities through the roles of Pulikecei and Ukraputhan to Nagesh 's roles in Server Sundaram ( 1964 ) and <unk> <unk> ( 1968 ) , where Nagesh plays more serious roles . 
 The moustache sported by Vadivelu is inspired and modelled after moustaches worn by the Spanish Catalan surrealist painter , Salvador Dali and Tamil poet , Subramania Bharati . Historical references in the film include places like Nalanda University , which was active around the 2nd century AD , and people like Veerapandiya Kattabomman , Robert Clive , and Ettappan . 
 G. Dhananjayan , S. Theodore Baskaran and Malathi Rangarajan called the film a parody of Uthama Puthiran ( 1958 ) . Malathi Rangarajan said that the sequences in the song " Aah <unk> " are reminiscent of scenes from the song " Yaaradi Nee Mohini " from Uthama Puthiran . Theodore Baskaran also compared the film to M. G. Ramachandran films like <unk> ( 1954 ) and <unk> Mannan ( 1958 ) . Saraswathy Srinivas of Rediff compared the film to Alexandre Dumas 's novel , The Man in the Iron Mask .

 = = Release = = 
 The satellite rights of the film were sold to Kalaignar TV . The film was originally scheduled for release on 19 May 2006 . However , the film 's release was delayed due to its use of animals without prior approval from the Animal Welfare Board of India ( AWBI ) . According to a rule issued in 2001 , film producers must obtain prior approval from the AWBI to use animals in a film . Further , scenes with animals must be filmed with a veterinary physician on the set . Crucial to the film 's story , the scenes were not re @-@ edited . In an interview , Deven stated that the elephants and horses in the film were not subjected to any cruelty . 
 When Shankar approached the AWBI for a No Objection Certificate ( NOC ) , he was denied . On 18 May , the Madras High Court requested that the AWBI issue the necessary certificate , but the organisation refused and said that it was the responsibility of the Central Board of Film Certification ( CBFC ) . In response , the CBFC said cited a rule issued by the Bombay High Court , noting that it was mandatory for the AWBI to provide an NOC to films which used animals . This led to the initial postponement of the film 's release until 9 June . On 13 June , the Madras High Court ordered that the film be given a censorship certificate by 19 June , along with the NOC from the AWBI . Because of this sequence of events , the film 's release date was further postponed . 
 Shankar and Vadivelu requested the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu , M. Karunanidhi , to intervene . A week before the release date , and with the help of Karunanidhi , Imsai Arasan 23rd Pulikecei was cleared by the Central Government . The film received an NOC , and was subsequently given a ' U ' ( Universal ) certificate without any cuts by the certification board . After months of delay , the film 's release finally occurred on 8 July in 135 screens across Tamil Nadu . R. B. Choudary 's Mega Super Good Films purchased the theatrical rights of the Telugu dubbed version . 
 The film was banned in Karnataka as the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce objected to a spoof film with Pulikecei 's name in the title being released in their state . Pulakesi II was a famous king who belonged to the Western Chalukyan Dynasty and ruled the Karnataka region in the seventh century . Vadivelu 's voice was dubbed by Brahmanandam in the Telugu version , which was released with the title , <unk> 23 Va Raju Pulikesi . 
 Post @-@ release , vendors sold unauthorised copies of the film on VCD in many areas of Tamil Nadu , especially in Chennai , where CDs were sold for ₹ 35 to 40 , and Madurai and Dindigul , where CDs were sold at ₹ 45 to 50 . Police conducted raids in the <unk> and <unk> areas of Chennai where they seized <unk> VCDs . Although infringement helped increase the film 's popularity , its theatrical run at the box office was still a financial success . 
 Sri Lankan Cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan watched the film in Kamala Theatres in Chennai with his family on 11 July 2006 . He praised the film 's innovative story , further saying that Vadivelu had developed a huge fan following in Sri Lanka through this film . To further promote the film , 50 children who watched it were given " Pulikesi moustaches " . [ sic ] The moustache became quite popular with children and further boosted the film 's popularity . Deven said that the moustache would become as popular as Superman 's outfit and Spider @-@ Man 's mask .

 S. Sudha credited the film 's art direction and cinematography as one of its major highlights . Art director Krishnamoorthy performed intense research to create the costumes for the characters and to design the palace sets . According to Theodore Baskaran , Arthur A.

 = = Details = = 
 The Costume Institute Gala is a major fundraising benefit that serves as an opening celebration for the Institute 's annual fashion exhibit . Following the event , the exhibition runs for several months . The 2014 exhibition was scheduled to run from May 8 until August 10 , 2014 . The Gala is widely regarded as one of the most exclusive social events in New York and one of the biggest fundraising nights in the city with $ 9 million raised in 2013 and a record of $ 12 million the following year . It is one of the most notable sources of funding for the Institute . The affair , attended by personalities from the arts , fashion , high @-@ society , film and music , has been held at the Met since 1946 and is considered to be the fashion industry 's premier annual red carpet event .

The theme not only sets the tone for the annual exhibit , but also for the guests who attempt to dress to uphold the theme of the year , oftentimes causing runs on certain fashion themes among the world 's leading fashion retailers . Sometimes , such as in 2013 , the theme is a bit befuddling because it does not provide a clear stylistic directive , while at other times , such as 2014 the theme may be far more challenging to one gender than the other .

 In 2015 the theme " China : Through the Looking Glass " was previously named " Chinese Whispers : Tales of the East in Art , Film and Fashion " . The same year 's theme was met with critics saying it was " A reminder of the subtle institutionalised racism that 's been compounded by centuries of Asian isolationism across the board , and enduring Western stereotypes exacerbated by ignorance and the meme @-@ able nature of social media . " In 2016 , Madonna whilst channeling the theme " Manus x Machina : Fashion in an Age of Technology " , provided one of the most controversial outfits in the gala 's history . She appeared in an ensemble designed by Givenchy creative director Riccardo Tisci exposing both her breasts and buttocks . Madonna hit back on her official social media channels by stating " We have fought and continue to fight for civil rights and gay rights around the world . When it comes to women ’ s rights we are still in the dark ages . My dress at the Met Ball was a political statement as well as a fashion statement " . 
 = Sinclair Executive = 
 The Sinclair Executive was the world 's first " slimline " pocket calculator , and the first to be produced by Clive Sinclair 's company Sinclair Radionics . Introduced in 1972 , there were at least two different versions of the Sinclair Executive , with different keyboard markings , and another called the Sinclair Executive Memory , introduced in 1973 . 
 Its small size was made possible by pulsing the current to the Texas Instruments integrated circuit , reducing the power consumption by a factor of more than 10 . The Executive was highly successful , making GB £ 1 @.@ 8 million of profit for Sinclair and winning a Design Council Award for Electronics . 
 = = History = = 
 The Executive was launched in September 1972 at the price of GB £ 79 @.@ 95 plus VAT , equivalent to £ 950 in 2015 when adjusted for inflation . This was around half the price of comparable calculators , but still twice the average weekly wage . It was the first pocket calculator , and the first to be mass @-@ produced , and its introduction to the market coincided with a number of other companies entering the calculator market . 
 Clive Sinclair , reckoning that the market for " executive toys " was not especially sensitive to price , ordered components for 100 @,@ 000 calculators . The Executive was highly successful , and made 1 @.@ 8 million pounds profit for Sinclair Radionics . It was well received by both domestic and foreign markets , and US $ 1 @.@ 5 million worth of Executives were sold in Japan in early 1974 at six times the price of Japanese models . The parts , consisting of the TI 1802 chip , 22 transistors , 50 resistors and 17 capacitors , cost close to GB £ 10 , compared with a sale price of close to GB £ 80 . The Executive impressed the engineers at Texas Instruments , who had used the same chip to produce a longer and wider calculator that was over three times as thick and a great deal more expensive . In 1974 , sales of the Executive were greater than GB £ 2 @.@ 5 million , and Sinclair was producing 100 @,@ 000 calculators each month , of which 55 % were exported . 
 A Sinclair Executive purchased by a Russian diplomat exploded in his breast pocket , allegedly leading to an official Soviet investigation . It was found that it had been left on by accident , leading to a current drain on the batteries that overheated them until they burst . 
 = = Design = = 
 It was significantly smaller than any of its competitors , and the first calculator that could easily be carried in a pocket . According to a Sinclair executive quoted in the Financial Times , " one must always bear a packet of cigarettes in mind as the ideal size , " possibly a quip on Clive Sinclair 's smoking habit . The Executive weighed 2 @.@ 5 ounces ( 71 g ) and measured 56 by 138 by 9 millimetres ( 2 @.@ 20 in × 5 @.@ 43 in × 0 @.@ 35 in ) . The case , designed by Richard Torrens and made of black injection @-@ moulded polycarbonate , required flexible glue to hold the two halves together . 
 Design Magazine described it as " at once a conversation piece , a rich man 's plaything and a functional business machine " . An example of the calculator is displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York , and the futuristic design earned it the Design Council Award for Electronics in 1973 . It was the first calculator designed to appeal to people because of its looks , and New Scientist described it as " not so much a professional calculator - more a piece of personal jewellery " . 
 = = = Functions = = = 
 As well as four @-@ function arithmetic , the Executive had the ability to compute squares , reciprocals , and multiply or divide by a fixed constant . The Executive could carry out sums to two , four or six decimal places , or use a floating decimal point . 
 = = = Chip = = = 
 The calculator was powered by a Texas Instruments GLS 1802 , a metal oxide semiconductor integrated circuit with 7000 transistors . A chip of this kind normally consumes 350 milliwatts , but by pulsing the power this requirement was reduced to 20 milliwatts . It was discovered that an early prototype continued to work if the batteries were disconnected and then reapplied quickly enough , as the capacitors in the circuit could hold a charge for up to five seconds . 
 Power is supplied to the chip in 1 @.@ 7 microsecond pulses as determined by the storage time of a control transistor . An oscillator clock operating at 200 kilohertz during calculations and dropping to 15 kilohertz between each operation means shut off time ranges from 3 @.@ 3 microseconds during calculations to over 65 microseconds between . The device relies on the capacitance of the chips to store information when there is no power , and 1 @.@ 7 microseconds proved sufficient for the chip to carry out a single change of state of the electronics . Any calculation can be done in 1000 such changes . This had the effect of extending battery life to about 20 hours of continuous use with three small hearing aid batteries , equivalent to about four months of normal usage . 
 = = = Screen = = = 
 The screen on the Executive was a monolithic seven @-@ segment gallium arsenide light emitting diode display , bought from a Canadian firm . Its small size reduced the power consumption and material cost , but it was still changed several times in pursuit of lower power consumption , creating issues with the reliability .

 The Executive Memory was launched in November 1973 , with the same physical dimensions as the original , but with the ability to memorise <unk> from any number of chain calculations . There were at least 3 versions , including the black and white Type 1 , and the Type 2 with a gold keyboard . The Executive Memory sold at the lower price of GB £ 24 @.@ 95 .

Usher explained to MTV that " Scream " was a record which " represented the other side of the [ album ] " , comparing " Climax " to the former song : 
 Whereas the first song was a little bit more artistic and a little bit more soulful , and it has done everything , it probably exceeded my expectations , I mean , from the moment I was able to give it away . I was able to kind of be reintroduced in a way musically , and thank you to [ producer ] Diplo , but ' Scream ' is really like the next step .

 The Sweet Escape is the second studio album by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani , released on December 1 , 2006 by Interscope Records . Having originally intended to return to No Doubt after her debut solo album , Love . Angel . Music . Baby . ( 2004 ) , Stefani decided to record a second album as a way to release some of the material left over from the Love . Angel . Music . Baby. writing sessions . The album musically resembles its predecessor while exploring more modern pop sounds . It was released to generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics , receiving criticism for its strong similarities to Love . Angel . Music . Baby . 
 It was preceded by the lead single " Wind It Up " , which charted moderately across the world , and produced the follow @-@ up single " The Sweet Escape " , which proved more successful worldwide . The Sweet Escape reached the top five in the United States , Canada , and Australia and peaked inside the top 20 in the United Kingdom .

 Following the release of her debut album Love . Angel . Music . Baby . , Stefani announced that she had intended to return to No Doubt and record a sixth studio album with the band . After the commercial success of L.A.M.B. , she decided to release several leftover tracks from the album as an EP or as extra tracks on a DVD . However , Pharrell Williams , with whom she had collaborated to write " Hollaback Girl " , convinced Stefani to create " a L.A.M.B. part two " , and the two recorded several songs during sessions in Miami in July 2005 . 
 The two produced " Wind It Up " , " Orange County Girl " , " U Started It " , " Yummy " , " Breaking Up " , and " Candyland " during these sessions , and the songs were used for a fashion show premiering the 2006 collection of Stefani 's fashion line L.A.M.B. She included performances of " Wind It Up " and " Orange County Girl " when she embarked on the Harajuku Lovers Tour in October 2005 . Stefani put the project on hold in December 2005 when she discovered that she was pregnant , before returning to the studio in August 2006 . The album 's working title was Candyland , sharing its name with an unreleased track that has only been looped via her fashion show soundtrack . The title was changed to The Sweet Escape , the title of the second track , to emphasize the album 's themes of wanting to escape to a better life . 
 = = = Album cover = = = 
 The album cover was taken by photographer Jill Greenberg . The image was part of a series of promotional images taken by Greenberg , inspired by her previous End Times exhibition . To create End Times , Greenberg gave lollipops to toddlers but took them back after several moments , provoking emotional outbursts . Greenberg used the images as a representation of American politics and society . Greenberg was accused of child abuse for the photo shoots ; Stefani , however , commented , " I didn 't think ' child abuse ' — I just thought , ' That 's beautiful . ' Every kid cries , " she asserts , and as if on cue , Kingston pipes up in the next room . " Other people reacted like , ' Oh my God . That 's so disturbing , ' or ' That 's so sad . ' I guess that 's what art 's all about . It 's supposed to make you think . " 
 Stefani 's appearance on the album cover is inspired by that of Elvira Hancock , a cocaine addict portrayed by Michelle Pfeiffer in the 1983 film Scarface . Stefani first gained inspiration for the style while shooting the music video for " Cool " in Lake Como , Italy . During the shoot , Stefani saw her No Doubt bandmate Tony Kanal and his girlfriend , who had on a " long , peach , polyester [ late @-@ 1970s style ] dress " . It was this dress that got Stefani thinking " about Michelle Pfeiffer and how amazingly styled she was [ in Scarface ] " , which in turn drew inspiration for the cover . The pair of oversized sunglasses on the album cover is intended to represent her " guarded exterior " , and the other images symbolize her various emotions . 
 = = Composition = = 
 The Sweet Escape has themes of romantic situations and details of her career and personal life , while sonically the album features " sparsely rhythmic tracks where she chants as much as she sings " and " pop songs that aim for choruses . " It starts with " Wind It Up " , which features fanfares and samples from The Sound of Music 's " The Lonely Goatherd " , having " material @-@ minded lyrics touting her fashion line and her shape . " The second and title track , " The Sweet Escape " , is a dance @-@ pop and doo wop song , which features Akon that provides a " wee @-@ oh ! " hook , with lyrics about a " feisty sort of apology . " " Orange County Girl " is an autobiographical rap song , where Stefani shows how she is " grateful for her success while recalling the simpler days of her youth . " The album 's first ballad , " Early Winter " , has influences of 80 's soft rock and lyrics about the need for fidelity and transparency in romantic relationship . " Now That You Got It " features military snare drums , loping hip @-@ hop beat and a staccato piano sample . Its lyrics has Stefani " act [ ing ] as if she 's doing a lover a favor and challenges him to come through . " 
 The sixth track " 4 in the Morning " is an 80 's @-@ inspired synthpop ballad , that lyrically deals with a relationship on the edge , while " Yummy " is a dance song , with a tribal rhythm , cameo by Pharrell Williams and lyrics that finds Stefani declaring that " making babies leaves her eager to feel sexy again . " " Fluorescent " features Angelo Moore on saxophone , and was compared to the works of Madonna and Prince , while " Breakin ' Up " has influences of hip @-@ hop and electronica and it 's " a breakup song built on a dying cell phone metaphor . " The tenth track , " Don 't Get It Twisted " , talks about an unexpected pregnancy , in a song influenced by reggaeton . " U Started It " was noted for having " lilting melody , silken harmonies , and pizzicato strings " , while the final track , " Wonderful Life " , was named a Depeche Mode @-@ style synth ballad about how much she misses her first love and how the person had a profound impact on her .

 The Sweet Escape received mixed reviews from music critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 58 , based on 24 reviews , which indicates " mixed or average reviews " . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote , " From the stilted production to the fashion fetish , all the way down to her decision to rap on far too much of the album , all the dance @-@ pop here seems like a pose . " Alex Miller 's review for the NME was more emphatic , dubbing it " this year 's bargain @-@ bin fodder " , and stated that " the majority of this record serves only to bury what made Gwen Stefani unique in the first place . " At Entertainment Weekly , Sia Michel noted that the album " has a surprisingly moody , lightly autobiographical feel " but that " Stefani isn 't convincing as a dissatisfied diva " . Pitchfork Media 's Mark Pytlik described the album 's oddities as a career risk for Stefani , where most of the " gonzo pop songs yield some degree of payout " but that Stefani 's tight scheduling during production of the album leaves the result " somewhere between the vanguard and the insipid . " Paul Flynn of The Observer , however , characterized the album as less interesting than Fergie 's The Dutchess and Nelly Furtado 's Loose . Robert Christgau cited the song " Yummy " as a " choice cut " ( ) . 
 The album received criticism for its similarities to Love . Angel . Music . Baby . Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine opined that " [ h ] <unk> will likely view The Sweet Escape as a retread of Stefani 's well @-@ received solo debut , but it shares that album 's general inconsistency and , thus , its peaks and valleys " . Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone agreed , viewing it as " her hasty return " to music lacking the energy of L.A.M.B. and in which " she sounds exhausted . " The New York Times ' Jon Pareles commented that Stefani " <unk> some of the same producers and repeats some of the old tricks with less flair " , adding that " superficiality is more fun when it doesn 't get so whiny . " Caroline Sullivan disagreed in her review for The Guardian , in which she stated that although some of the songs date back to the 2003 writing sessions for L.A.M.B. , " generally The Sweet Escape feels minty @-@ fresh . " PopMatters ' review by Quentin B. Huff , however , referred to The Sweet Escape as L.A.M.B. : Reloaded and described The Sweet Escape and L.A.M.B. as " the same album , just add more rap , a glossy Next @-@ Top @-@ Model @-@ ish photo for the cover , and a few more recent @-@ sounding influences .

 The Sweet Escape Tour was Stefani 's follow @-@ up to the Harajuku Lovers Tour . It went worldwide as compared to her previous tour which was constricted only to North America and had more than double the number of shows . It was Stefani 's last solo effort as she rejoined her band No Doubt after the tour ended . The main feature were usage of various props such as a prison for Stefani 's opening act , a six @-@ piece band and a large multimedia screen in the backdrop showing videos and animations . 
 The tour had its own set of controversies . A group of students making up for The National Union of Malaysian Muslim Students , banned Stefani 's concert that was slated to take place August 21 , 2007 at Putra Indoor Stadium in Kuala Lumpur . The union 's vice president , Abdul <unk> , said , " Her performance and her attire are not suitable for our culture . It promotes a certain degree of obscenity and will encourage youth to emulate the western lifestyle . The concert should be stopped . " The organizer of the event , Maxis Communications , later responded , " Stefani has confirmed that her concert will not feature any revealing costumes . She will abide by the Malaysian authorities ' guidelines to ensure that her show will not be offensive to local sensitivities . " In April 2007 , Akon drew criticism for engaging in on @-@ stage dirty dancing with a 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl at a club in Port of Spain , Trinidad and Tobago , as part of a fake contest .

He was inspired to write it on May 3 , 1915 , after presiding over the funeral of friend and fellow soldier Alexis Helmer , who died in the Second Battle of Ypres . According to legend , fellow soldiers retrieved the poem after McCrae , initially dissatisfied with his work , discarded it . " In Flanders Fields " was first published on December 8 of that year in the London @-@ based magazine Punch . 
 It is one of the most popular and most quoted poems from the war . As a result of its immediate popularity , parts of the poem were used in propaganda efforts and appeals to recruit soldiers and raise money selling war bonds . Its references to the red poppies that grew over the graves of fallen soldiers resulted in the remembrance poppy becoming one of the world 's most recognized memorial symbols for soldiers who have died in conflict . The poem and poppy are prominent Remembrance Day symbols throughout the Commonwealth of Nations , particularly in Canada , where " In Flanders Fields " is one of the nation 's best @-@ known literary works . The poem also has wide exposure in the United States , where it is associated with Memorial Day . 
 = = Background = = 
 John McCrae was a poet and physician from Guelph , Ontario . He developed an interest in poetry at a young age and wrote throughout his life . His earliest works were published in the mid @-@ 1890s in Canadian magazines and newspapers . McCrae 's poetry often focused on death and the peace that followed . 
 At the age of 41 , McCrae enrolled with the Canadian Expeditionary Force following the outbreak of the First World War . He had the option of joining the medical corps because of his training and age , but he volunteered instead to join a fighting unit as a gunner and medical officer . It was his second tour of duty in the Canadian military . He had previously fought with a volunteer force in the Second Boer War . He considered himself a soldier first ; his father was a military leader in Guelph and McCrae grew up believing in the duty of fighting for his country and empire . 
 McCrae fought in the second battle of Ypres in the Flanders region of Belgium where the German army launched one of the first chemical attacks in the history of war . They attacked the Canadian position with chlorine gas on April 22 , 1915 , but were unable to break through the Canadian line , which held for over two weeks . In a letter written to his mother , McCrae described the battle as a " nightmare " : " For seventeen days and seventeen nights none of us have had our clothes off , nor our boots even , except occasionally . In all that time while I was awake , gunfire and rifle fire never ceased for sixty seconds .... And behind it all was the constant background of the sights of the dead , the wounded , the maimed , and a terrible anxiety lest the line should give way . " Alexis Helmer , a close friend , was killed during the battle on May 2 . McCrae performed the burial service himself , at which time he noted how poppies quickly grew around the graves of those who died at Ypres . The next day , he composed the poem while sitting in the back of an ambulance at an Advanced Dressing Station outside Ypres . This location is today known as the John McCrae Memorial Site .

 The first chapter of In Flanders Fields and Other Poems , a 1919 collection of McCrae 's works , gives the text of the poem as follows : 
 As with his earlier poems , " In Flanders Fields " continues McCrae 's preoccupation with death and how it stands as the transition between the struggle of life and the peace that follows . It is written from the point of view of the dead . It speaks of their sacrifice and serves as their command to the living to press on . As with many of the most popular works of the First World War , it was written early in the conflict , before the romanticism of war turned to bitterness and disillusion for soldiers and civilians alike .

 Cyril Allinson was a sergeant major in McCrae 's unit . While delivering the brigade 's mail , he watched McCrae as he worked on the poem , noting that McCrae 's eyes periodically returned to Helmer 's grave as he wrote . When handed the notepad , Allinson read the poem and was so moved he immediately committed it to memory . He described it as being " almost an exact description of the scene in front of us both " . According to legend , McCrae was not satisfied with his work . It is said he crumpled the paper and threw it away . It was retrieved by a fellow member of his unit , either Edward Morrison or J. M. Elder , or Allinson himself . McCrae was convinced to submit the poem for publication . 
 Another story of the poem 's origin claimed that Helmer 's funeral was actually held on the morning of May 2 , after which McCrae wrote the poem in 20 minutes . A third claim , by Morrison , was that McCrae worked on the poem as time allowed between arrivals of wounded soldiers in need of medical attention . Regardless of its true origin , McCrae worked on the poem for months before considering it ready for publication . He submitted it to The Spectator in London , but it was rejected . It was then sent to Punch , where it was published on December 8 , 1915 . It was published anonymously , but Punch attributed the poem to McCrae in its year @-@ end index . 
 The word that ends the first line of the poem has been disputed . According to Allinson , the poem began with " In Flanders Fields the poppies grow " when first written . However , since McCrae ended the second @-@ to @-@ last line with " grow " , Punch received permission to change the wording of the opening line to end with " blow " . McCrae himself used either word when making handwritten copies for friends and family . Questions over how the first line should end have endured since publication . Most recently , the Bank of Canada was inundated with queries and complaints from those who believed the first line should end with " grow " when a design for the ten @-@ dollar bill was released in 2001 that featured the first stanza of " In Flanders Fields " , ending the first line with " blow " .

 According to historian Paul Fussell , " In Flanders Fields " was the most popular poem of its era . McCrae received numerous letters and telegrams praising his work when he was revealed as the author . The poem was republished throughout the world , rapidly becoming synonymous with the sacrifice of the soldiers who died in the First World War . It was translated into numerous languages , so many that McCrae himself quipped that " it needs only Chinese now , surely " . Its appeal was nearly universal . Soldiers took encouragement from it as a statement of their duty to those who died while people on the home front viewed it as defining the cause for which their brothers and sons were fighting . 
 It was often used for propaganda , particularly in Canada by the Unionist Party during the 1917 federal election amidst the Conscription Crisis . French Canadians in Quebec were strongly opposed to the possibility of conscription , but English Canadians voted overwhelmingly to support Prime Minister Robert Borden and the Unionist government . " In Flanders Fields " was said to have done more to " make this Dominion persevere in the duty of fighting for the world 's ultimate peace than all the political speeches of the recent campaign " . McCrae , a staunch supporter of the empire and the war effort , was pleased with the effect his poem had on the election . He stated in a letter : " I hope I stabbed a [ French ] Canadian with my vote . " 
 The poem was a popular motivational tool in Great Britain , where it was used to encourage soldiers fighting against Germany , and in the United States where it was reprinted across the country . It was one of the most quoted works during the war , used in many places as part of campaigns to sell war bonds , during recruiting efforts and to criticize pacifists and those who sought to profit from the war . American composer Charles Ives used " In Flanders Fields " as the basis for a song of the same name that premiered in 1917 . Fussell criticized the poem in his work The Great War and Modern Memory ( 1975 ) . He noted the distinction between the pastoral tone of the first nine lines and the " recruiting @-@ poster rhetoric " of the third stanza . Describing it as " vicious " and " stupid " , Fussell called the final lines a " propaganda argument against a negotiated peace " .

 McCrae was moved to the medical corps and stationed in Boulogne , France , in June 1915 where he was promoted to Lieutenant @-@ Colonel , and placed in charge of medicine at the Number 3 Canadian General Hospital . He was promoted to the acting rank of Colonel on January 13 , 1918 , and named Consulting Physician to the British Armies in France . The years of war had worn McCrae down , however . He contracted pneumonia that same day , and later came down with cerebral meningitis . On January 28 , 1918 , he died at the military hospital in Wimereux and was buried there with full military honours . A book of his works , featuring " In Flanders Fields " was published the following year . 
 " In Flanders Fields " has attained iconic status in Canada , where it is a staple of Remembrance Day ceremonies and may be the most well known literary piece among English Canadians . It has an official French adaptation , entitled " Au champ d 'honneur " , written by Jean <unk> and used by the Canadian government in French and bilingual ceremonies . In addition to an excerpted appearance on the ten @-@ dollar bill from 2001 to 2013 , the Royal Canadian Mint has released poppy @-@ themed quarters on several occasions . A version minted in 2004 featured a red poppy in the centre and is considered the first multi @-@ coloured circulation coin in the world . To mark the poem 's centennial in 2015 , a colored and <unk> poppy quarter and a " <unk> " ( $ 2 coin ) were issued as circulation coins , as well as other collector coins . Among its uses in popular culture , the line " to you from failing hands we throw the torch , be yours to hold it high " has served as a motto for the Montreal Canadiens hockey club since 1940 . 
 Canada Post honored the 50th anniversary of John McCrae 's death with a stamp in 1968 , and marked the centennial of his famous poem in 2015 . Other Canadian stamps have featured the poppy , including ones in 1975 , 2001 , 2009 , 2013 and 2014 , and other postal authorities have employed the poppy as a symbol of remembrance , including those of Australia , Gibraltar , the United Kingdom and United States . 
 McCrae 's birthplace in Guelph , Ontario has been converted into a museum dedicated to his life and the war . McCrae himself was designated a National Historic Person in 1946 , and his house was designated a National Historic Site in 1966 . 
 In Belgium , the In Flanders Fields Museum in Ypres , named after the poem and devoted to the First World War , is situated in one of Flanders ' largest tourist areas . A monument commemorating the writing of the poem is located at Essex Farm Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery , which is thought to have been the location of Helmer 's burial and now lies within the John McCrae Memorial Site . 
 Despite its enduring fame , " In Flanders Fields " is often ignored by academics teaching and discussing Canadian literature . The poem is sometimes viewed as an anachronism ; It spoke of glory and honour in a war that has since become synonymous with the futility of trench warfare and the wholesale slaughter produced by 20th century weaponry . Nancy Holmes , professor at the University of British Columbia , speculated that its patriotic nature and usage as a tool for propaganda may have led literary critics to view it as a national symbol or anthem rather than a poem . 
 = = = Remembrance poppies = = = 
 The red poppies that McCrae referred to had been associated with war since the Napoleonic Wars when a writer of that time first noted how the poppies grew over the graves of soldiers . The damage done to the landscape in Flanders during the battle greatly increased the lime content in the surface soil , leaving the poppy as one of the few plants able to grow in the region . 
 Inspired by " In Flanders Fields " , American professor <unk> Michael resolved at the war 's conclusion in 1918 to wear a red poppy year @-@ round to honour the soldiers who had died in the war . She also wrote a poem in response called " We Shall Keep the Faith " . She distributed silk poppies to her peers and campaigned to have them adopted as an official symbol of remembrance by the American Legion . Madame E. Guérin attended the 1920 convention where the Legion supported Michael 's proposal and was herself inspired to sell poppies in her native France to raise money for the war 's orphans . In 1921 , Guérin sent poppy sellers to London ahead of Armistice Day , attracting the attention of Field Marshal Douglas Haig . A co @-@ founder of The Royal British Legion , Haig supported and encouraged the sale . The practice quickly spread throughout the British Empire . The wearing of poppies in the days leading up to Remembrance Day remains popular in many areas of the Commonwealth of Nations , particularly Great Britain , Canada , and South Africa , and in the days leading up to ANZAC Day in Australia and New Zealand . 
 = NSB Class 92 = 
 NSB Class 92 ( Norwegian : NSB type 92 ) is a class of 15 diesel multiple units built by Duewag for the Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) . The two @-@ car trains were delivered in 1984 and 1985 , and put into service on the Røros Line and southern part of the Nordland Line — which later became the Trøndelag Commuter Rail . Later , they also entered service on the Meråker Line as part of the international Mittnabotåget service . Previously , the trains were also used on the Solør Line , further north on the Nordland Line and on the now electrified Arendal Line . In 2000 , a unit was involved in the Åsta accident , which killed 19 people . The trains were refurbished in 2005 and 2006 , and NSB plans to replace them by around 2019 . Each twin unit seats 168 people , is 49 @.@ 45 meters ( 162 @.@ 2 ft ) long and weighs 92 tonnes ( 91 long tons ; 101 short tons ) . The front car is powered with two electric motors , giving a power output of 714 kilowatts ( 957 hp ) and a maximum speed of 140 kilometers per hour ( 87 mph ) . 
 = = History = = 
 By the 1980s , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Class 86 and Class 91 trains were in need of replacement . NSB described them as unable to satisfy demands in terms of economy , comfort or speed . Class 92 was bought to take over all passenger transport on the Røros Line and on the Nordland Line south of Grong . The 15 two @-@ car units cost NOK 200 million and were built by Duewag in Germany . 
 When introduced , the schedules were also changed to cut a number of the smallest intermediate stops . Class 92 has considerably better curve speed , and is able to operate at least at 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) through all curves on the main lines and on the steepest sections . It also features better acceleration and deceleration than its predecessors . With the change of schedules from 2 June 1985 , this resulted in travel time between Røros and Hamar being reduced by one hour , a reduction of 25 minutes between Trondheim and Steinkjer , and a reduction of 50 minutes between Trondheim and Grong . At the same time , the schedules were changed for optimal correspondence , such as with the night train in Trondheim and departures from Trondheim Airport , Værnes . The Røros Line also received a single daily through train from Røros to Oslo . 
 From June 1986 , the class was also put into the morning train from Mo i Rana to Trondheim and the return trip in the evening . The new service increased the average speed , including stops , to 80 kilometres per hour ( 50 mph ) and a maximum speed on straight section of 130 kilometres per hour ( 81 mph ) , as well as 10 percent higher speeds in curves . The service allowed passengers taking the morning train from Oslo to arrive in Mo i Rana in the evening . The class was also used on the Arendal Line and the Solør Line . It remained in used on the Arendal Line until 1995 , when the line was electrified . 
 In 1993 , NSB announced that the traffic around Trondheim would become the Trøndelag Commuter Rail , which would take over most of the Class 92 trains . The service started on 1 September 1993 . The changes to the schedule involved almost a doubling of the number of departures , particularly between Trondheim and Stjørdal , where a one @-@ hour headway was introduced . The service from Trondheim to Steinkjer had ten daily round trips . While local trains had existed previously north of Trondheim , the services south to Oppdal were all new in an area which was previously only served by intercity and night trains . The initial services consisted of four services from Trondheim — northwards along the Nordland Line to Steinkjer , east along the Meråker Line to Storlien , south along the Dovre Line to Oppdal and south @-@ east along the Røros Line to Tynset . 
 On 4 January 2000 , a Class 92 train was damaged beyond repair in the Åsta accident near Åsta Station on the Røros Line . Nineteen people were killed in the accident . From 7 January 2001 , NSB made several major changes to the commuter rail . A fixed , hourly headway was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim ; including extra rush @-@ hour trains from Lerkendal to Stjørdal , giving 23 departures per day in each direction . South of Trondheim , the service was rerouted to terminate at Lerkendal . Part of the reason for the expansion was that the delivery of the new Class 93 trains for regional services freed up more Class 92 units . This also allowed NSB to operate some of services with double unit ( four @-@ car ) trains in rush @-@ hour . 
 From 22 September 2002 , NSB and the Public Transportation Authority in Jämtlands County started a cooperation that involved two daily round trips with an Class 92 trains between Trondheim and Östersund in Sweden , on the Meråker Line and Central Line . Branded as Mittnabotåget , the trains were manned by NSB on the Norwegian side of the border , and by BK Tåg staff on the Swedish side , after the latter had won a public service obligation contract with the Swedish authority . 
 The class was upgraded in 2005 and 2006 , which included given them a new interior and a new paint scheme . NSB has stated that the last year the Class 92 will be in use is 2019 . There are plans to electrify the Nordland Line from Trondheim to Steinkjer , as well as the Meråker Line . Once these lines are electrified , the Class 92 can be retired , although no date has yet been set . During May and June 2012 all NSB Class 92 trains based in Trondheim were fitted with free wireless Internet access for the passengers .

 = Epsilon Eridani = 
 Epsilon Eridani ( ε Eri , ε Eridani ) , or Ran , is a star in the southern constellation Eridanus , along a declination 9 @.@ 46 ° south of the celestial equator . This allows it to be viewed from most of Earth 's surface . At a distance of 10 @.@ 5 light years ( ly ) , it has an apparent magnitude of 3 @.@ 73 . It is the third closest individual star or star system visible to the unaided eye and is the closest star known to host a planet . Its age is estimated at less than a billion years . Because of its youth , Epsilon Eridani has a higher level of magnetic activity than the present @-@ day Sun , with a stellar wind 30 times as strong . Its rotation period is 11 @.@ 2 days at the equator . Epsilon Eridani is smaller and less massive than the Sun , and has a comparatively lower level of elements heavier than helium . It is a main @-@ sequence star of spectral class K2 , which means that energy generated at the core through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is emitted from the surface at a temperature of about 5 @,@ 000 K , giving it an orange hue . 
 The motion of Epsilon Eridani along the line of sight to Earth , known as the radial velocity , has been regularly observed for more than twenty years . Periodic changes in this data yielded evidence of a giant planet orbiting Epsilon Eridani , making it one of the nearest extrasolar systems with a candidate exoplanet . The detection of this orbiting planetary object , Epsilon Eridani b , was announced by Bruce Campbell , Gordon Walker and Stephenson Yang in 1987 . A preliminary orbit was published in 2000 by a team of astronomers led by Artie <unk> , based on six independent data sets with four different telescopes . Current data indicate that this planet orbits with a period of about 7 years at a mean separation of 3 @.@ 4 astronomical units ( AU ) , where 1 AU is the mean distance between Earth and the Sun . Although this discovery has been controversial because of the amount of background noise in the radial velocity data , many astronomers now regard the planet as confirmed . 
 The system includes two belts of rocky asteroids : one at about 3 AU and a second at about 20 AU , whose structure may be maintained by a hypothetical second planet , Epsilon Eridani c . Epsilon Eridani harbors an extensive outer debris disk of remnant planetesimals left over from the system 's formation . 
 Epsilon Eridani 's designation was established in 1603 by Johann Bayer . It may be a member of the Ursa Major Moving Group of stars that share a similar motion through the Milky Way , implying these stars shared a common origin in an open cluster . Its nearest neighbor , the binary star system Luyten 726 @-@ 8 , will have a close encounter with Epsilon Eridani in approximately 31 @,@ 500 years when they will be separated by about 0 @.@ 93 ly . As one of the nearest Sun @-@ like stars with the potential for a planet that may harbor life , Epsilon Eridani has been the target of SETI searches . Epsilon Eridani appears in science fiction stories and has been suggested as a destination for interstellar travel . From Epsilon Eridani , the Sun would appear as a 2 @.@ 4 @-@ magnitude star in Serpens .

 = = = Cataloguing = = = 
 Epsilon Eridani has been known to astronomers since at least the 2nd century , when it was included by Claudius Ptolemy , a Greek astronomer from Alexandria , Egypt , in his catalogue of more than 1000 stars . The catalogue was included as the 7th ( northern sky ) and 8th ( southern sky ) books of his 13 @-@ book astronomical treatise <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , known by its later Arabic name Almagest . Constellation Eridanus , named by Ptolemy " <unk> " ( " River " ) , was included in the 8th book as the 9th constellation ( or 36th from the beginning ) , and Epsilon Eridani was the 13th star , listed in the River . Ptolemy called Epsilon Eridani " <unk> <unk> δ <unk> " ( here " δ " is number " 4 " ) , which means in Greek " a foregoing of the four " . The " four " is a group of four stars in Eridanus : γ , π , δ and ε ( 10th – 13th ) , of which ε is the most western , and thus , the first of the four in the apparent daily motion of the sky from east to west . The modern designations of its entry in Ptolemy 's catalogue are " P 784 " ( in order of appearance ) and " Eri 13 " . The magnitude , assigned to Epsilon Eridani by Ptolemy , was 3 . 
 Epsilon Eridani was included in star catalogues of medieval Islamic astronomical treatises , which were based on Ptolemy 's catalogue : in Al @-@ Sufi 's Book of Fixed Stars , published in 964 , Al @-@ Biruni 's Mas 'ud Canon , published in 1030 , and Ulugh Beg 's Zij @-@ i Sultani , published in 1437 . Al @-@ Sufi 's estimate of Epsilon Eridani 's magnitude was 3 . Al @-@ Biruni quotes magnitudes from Ptolemy and Al @-@ Sufi ( however , for Epsilon Eridani he quotes the value 4 for both Ptolemy 's and Al @-@ Sufi 's magnitudes , whereas original values of both these magnitudes are 3 ) . Its number in order of appearance is 786 . Ulugh Beg carried out new measurements of Epsilon Eridani 's coordinates in his observatory at Samarkand , and quotes magnitudes from Al @-@ Sufi ( 3 for Epsilon Eridani ) . The modern designations of its entry in Ulugh Beg 's catalogue are " U 781 " and " Eri 13 " ( the latter is the same as Ptolemy 's catalogue designation ) . 
 In 1598 Epsilon Eridani was included in Tycho Brahe 's star catalogue , republished also in 1627 by Johannes Kepler as part of his Rudolphine Tables . This catalogue was based on Tycho Brahe 's observations including those on the island of <unk> at his observatories Uraniborg and <unk> , during 1577 — 1597 . The sequence number of Epsilon Eridani in constellation Eridanus was 10 , and it was designated " Quae omnes quatuor <unk> " , which means in Latin " Which precedes all four " ; the meaning is the same as Ptolemy 's designation . Brahe assigned it magnitude 3 . 
 Epsilon Eridani 's Bayer designation was established in 1603 as part of the Uranometria , a star catalogue produced by German celestial cartographer Johann Bayer . His catalogue assigned letters from the Greek alphabet to groups of stars belonging to the same visual magnitude class in each constellation , beginning with alpha ( α ) for a star in the brightest class . However , Bayer made no attempt to arrange stars by relative brightness within each class . Thus , although Epsilon is the fifth letter in the Greek alphabet , the star is the tenth brightest star in Eridanus . In addition to the letter ε , Bayer had given it the number 13 ( the same as Ptolemy 's catalogue number , as were many of Bayer 's numbers ) and designation " Decima <unk> " , which means in Latin " The seventeenth " . The meaning of this : Bayer designated 21 stars in the northern part of Eridanus along the river from east to west from the first ( β , " Supra <unk> Orionis in <unk> , prima " , that is " Above the foot of Orion in the river , the first " ) to the twenty @-@ first ( σ , " <unk> prima " , that is " the twenty @-@ first " ) , and Epsilon Eridani was the seventeenth of them . These 21 stars are : β , λ , ψ , b , ω , μ , c , ν , ξ , ο ( two stars ) , d , A , γ , π , δ , ε , ζ , ρ , η , σ . Bayer assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3 . 
 In 1690 Epsilon Eridani was included in the star catalogue of Johannes Hevelius . Its sequence number in constellation Eridanus was 14 , its designation was " Tertia " ( " the third " ) , and it was assigned magnitude 3 ( according to <unk> and Gent ) or 4 ( according to Baily ) . The star catalogue of English astronomer John Flamsteed , published in 1712 , gave Epsilon Eridani the Flamsteed designation 18 Eridani because it was the eighteenth catalogued star in the constellation of Eridanus by order of increasing right ascension . In 1818 Epsilon Eridani was included in Friedrich Bessel 's catalogue , based on James Bradley 's observations during 1750 – 1762 . Assigned magnitude was 4 . It also appeared in Nicolas Louis de Lacaille 's catalogue of 398 principal stars , whose 307 @-@ star version was published in 1755 in the <unk> des <unk> <unk> , pour dix <unk> , 1755 — 1765 , and whose full version was published in 1757 in <unk> Fundamenta , Paris . In its 1831 edition by Francis Baily Epsilon Eridani has the number 50 . Lacaille assigned it magnitude 3 . 
 In 1801 Epsilon Eridani was included in Histoire Céleste Française , Joseph Jérôme <unk> de Lalande 's catalogue of about 50 @,@ 000 stars , based on his observations during 1791 — 1800 , in which observations are arranged in a time order . It contains three observations of Epsilon Eridani : 1796 September 17 ( page 246 ) , 1796 December 3 ( page 248 ) and 1797 November 13 ( page 307 ) . In 1847 , an edition of Lalande 's catalogue ( Francis Baily et al . ) was published , containing the majority of its observations , in which the stars were numbered in order of right ascension . Because every observation of every star was numbered and Epsilon Eridani was observed three times , it got three numbers : <unk> , <unk> and 6583 . ( Today numbers from this catalogue are used with the prefix " Lalande " , or " Lal " ) . Lalande assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3 . Also in 1801 it was included in the catalogue of Johann Bode , in which about 17 @,@ 000 stars were grouped into 102 constellations and numbered ( Epsilon Eridani got the number 159 in the constellation Eridanus ) . Bode 's catalogue was based on observations of various astronomers , including Bode himself , but mostly on Lalande 's and Lacaille 's ( for the southern sky ) , and an observer for Epsilon Eridani was Lalande . Bode assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3 . In 1814 Giuseppe Piazzi published the second edition of his star catalogue ( its first edition was published in 1803 ) , based on observations during 1792 — 1813 , in which more than 7000 stars were grouped into 24 hours ( 0 — 23 ) . Epsilon Eridani is number 89 in hour 3 . Piazzi assigned it magnitude 4 . In 1918 Epsilon Eridani appeared in the Henry Draper Catalogue with the designation HD <unk> and a preliminary spectral classification of K0 .

 Based on observations between 1800 and 1880 , Epsilon Eridani was found to have a large proper motion across the celestial sphere , which was estimated at an angular velocity of three arcseconds annually . This movement implied it was relatively close to the Sun , making it a star of interest for the purpose of trigonometric parallax measurements . This process involves recording the position of Epsilon Eridani as Earth moves around the Sun , which allows a star 's distance to be estimated . From 1881 to 1883 , American astronomer William L. Elkin used a <unk> at the Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope , South Africa to compare the position of Epsilon Eridani with two nearby stars . From these observations , a parallax of 0 @.@ 14 ± 0 @.@ 02 arcseconds was calculated . By 1917 , observers had refined their parallax estimate to 0 @.@ 317 arcseconds . The modern value of 0 @.@ <unk> arcseconds is equivalent to a distance of about 10 @.@ 50 ly ( 3 @.@ 22 parsecs ) .

 Based on unexplained changes in the position of Epsilon Eridani between 1938 and 1972 , Dutch – American astronomer Peter van de Kamp proposed that an unseen companion with an orbital period of 25 years was causing gravitational perturbations in its position . This claim was refuted in 1993 by German astronomer Wulff @-@ Dieter Heintz and the false detection was blamed on a systematic error in the photographic plates . 
 Launched in 1983 , the space telescope IRAS detected infrared emissions from stars near to the Sun . Two years later , the presence of an excess infrared emission close to Epsilon Eridani was announced , which indicated a disk of fine @-@ grained cosmic dust was orbiting Epsilon Eridani . This debris disk has since been extensively studied . Evidence for a planetary system was discovered in 1998 by the observation of asymmetries in this dust ring . These clumps of dust could be explained by gravitational interaction with a planet orbiting just inside the ring of dust . 
 In 1987 , the detection of an orbiting planetary object was announced by Bruce Campbell , Gordon Walker and Stephenson Yang . From 1980 to 2000 , a team of astronomers led by American Artie P. <unk> made radial velocity observations of Epsilon Eridani , measuring changes in motion of Epsilon Eridani along the line of sight to Earth , which provided evidence of the gravitational effect of a planet orbiting it with a period of about seven years . Although there is a high level of noise in the radial velocity data due to magnetic activity in its photosphere , any periodicity caused by this magnetic activity is expected to show a strong correlation with variations in emission lines of ionized calcium ( the Ca II H and K lines ) . Because no such correlation was found , a planetary companion was deemed the most likely cause . This discovery was supported by astrometric measurements of Epsilon Eridani made between 2001 and 2003 with the Hubble Space Telescope , which showed evidence for gravitational perturbation of Epsilon Eridani by a planet . 
 American astrophysicist Alice C. Quillen and her student Stephen Thorndike performed computer simulations of the structure of the dust disk around Epsilon Eridani . Their model suggested that the clumping of the dust particles could be explained by the presence of a second planet in an eccentric orbit . They announced this finding in 2002 .

 In 1960 , American physicist Philip Morrison and Italian physicist Giuseppe <unk> proposed that extraterrestrial civilizations might be using radio signals for communication . Project Ozma , headed by American astronomer Frank Drake , used the <unk> Telescope to search for such signals from the nearby Sun @-@ like stars Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti . The systems were observed at the emission frequency of neutral hydrogen , 1 @,@ 420 MHz . No signals of intelligent extraterrestrial origin were detected . Drake repeated the experiment in 2010 , with the same negative result . Despite this lack of success , Epsilon Eridani made its way into science fiction literature and television shows for many years following news of Drake 's initial experiment . 
 In Habitable Planets for Man , a 1964 RAND Corporation study by American space scientist Stephen H. Dole , the probability of a habitable planet being in orbit around Epsilon Eridani were estimated at 3 @.@ 3 % . Among the known stars within 22 ly , it was listed with the 14 stars that were thought most likely to have a habitable planet . 
 American space scientist William I. McLaughlin proposed a new strategy in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( SETI ) in 1977 . He suggested that widely observable events such as nova explosions might be used by intelligent extraterrestrials to synchronize the transmission and reception of their signals . This idea was tested from the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in 1988 , which used outbursts of Nova Cygni 1975 as the timer . Fifteen days of observation showed no anomalous radio signals coming from Epsilon Eridani . 
 Because of the proximity and Sun @-@ like properties of Epsilon Eridani , American physicist Robert L. Forward considered the system as one of the targets for interstellar travel in 1985 . The following year , the British Interplanetary Society suggested Epsilon Eridani as one of several targets in its Project Daedalus paper study . The system has continued to be among the targets of such proposals , as with Project Icarus in 2011 . 
 Based on its location within 23 @.@ 5 ly ( 7 @.@ 2 parsecs ) , Epsilon Eridani was among the target stars of Project Phoenix , a 1995 microwave survey for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence . The project had checked about 800 stars by 2004 , but had not yet detected an unimpeachable signal .

 At a distance of 10 @.@ 50 ly ( 3 @.@ 22 parsecs ) , Epsilon Eridani is the 13th @-@ nearest known star ( and ninth nearest solitary star or stellar system ) to the Sun as of 2014 . Its proximity makes it one of the most studied stars of its stellar classification . Epsilon Eridani is located in the northern part of the constellation Eridanus , about 3 ° east of the slightly brighter star Delta Eridani . With a declination of − 9 @.@ 46 ° , Epsilon Eridani can be viewed from much of Earth 's surface . Only to the north of latitude 80 ° N is it permanently hidden below the horizon . The apparent magnitude of 3 @.@ 73 can make it difficult to observe from an urban area with the unaided eye , because the night skies over cities are obscured by light pollution . 
 Epsilon Eridani has an estimated 82 % of the Sun 's mass and 74 % of the Sun 's radius , but only 34 % of its luminosity . The estimated surface temperature is 5 @,@ 084 K. With a stellar classification of K2 V , it is the second @-@ nearest K @-@ type main @-@ sequence star after Alpha Centauri B. Indeed , since 1943 , the spectrum of Epsilon Eridani has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified . Its metallicity , or enrichment in elements heavier than helium , is slightly lower than the Sun 's . In Epsilon Eridani 's chromosphere , a region of the outer atmosphere just above the light emitting photosphere , the proportion of iron is estimated at 74 % of the Sun 's abundance . 
 Epsilon Eridani 's K @-@ type classification indicates that the spectrum has relatively weak absorption lines from energy absorbed by hydrogen and strong lines of neutral atoms and singly ionized calcium ( Ca II ) . The luminosity class V is assigned to stars that are undergoing thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in their core . For a K @-@ type main @-@ sequence star , this fusion is dominated by the proton – proton chain reaction , wherein a series of mergers of four hydrogen nuclei results in a helium nucleus . In their inner region , energy is transported outward from the core by means of radiation , which results in no net motion of the surrounding plasma . Outside of this region , in their envelope , energy is carried to the photosphere by plasma convection , where it then radiates into space . 
 = = = Magnetic activity = = = 
 Epsilon Eridani has a higher level of magnetic activity than the Sun , and hence demonstrates increased activity in the outer parts of its atmosphere : the chromosphere and corona . The average magnetic @-@ field strength of Epsilon Eridani across the entire surface is ( 1 @.@ 65 ± 0 @.@ 30 ) × 10 − 2 T , which is more than forty times greater than the ( 5 – 40 ) × 10 − 5 T magnetic @-@ field strength in the Sun 's photosphere . The magnetic properties can be modeled by assuming that regions with a magnetic flux of about 0 @.@ 14 T randomly cover approximately 9 % of the photosphere , whereas the remainder of the surface is free of magnetic fields . The overall magnetic activity of Epsilon Eridani is irregular , but it may vary with a 4 @.@ 9 @-@ year period . Assuming that its radius does not change over this interval , the long @-@ term variation in activity level appears to produce a temperature variation of 15 K , which corresponds to a variation in visual magnitude ( V ) of 0 @.@ 014 . 
 The magnetic field on the surface of Epsilon Eridani causes variations in the hydrodynamic behavior of the photosphere . This results in greater jitter during measurements of its radial velocity Doppler shift . Variations of 15 m s − 1 were measured over a 20 year period , which is much higher than the measurement error rate of 3 m s − 1 . This makes interpretation of <unk> in the radial velocity of Epsilon Eridani , such as those caused by the gravitational perturbations of an orbiting planet , more difficult . 
 Epsilon Eridani is classified as a BY Draconis variable because it has regions of higher magnetic activity that move into and out of the line of sight as it rotates . Measurement of this rotational modulation suggests that its equatorial region rotates with an average period of 11 @.@ 2 days , which is less than half of the rotation period of the Sun . Observations have shown that Epsilon Eridani varies as much as 0 @.@ 050 in V magnitude due to starspots and other short @-@ term magnetic activity . Photometry has also shown that the surface of Epsilon Eridani , like the Sun , is undergoing differential rotation , which means that the rotation period at the surface varies by latitude . The measured periods range from 10 @.@ 8 to 12 @.@ 3 days . The axial tilt of Epsilon Eridani toward the line of sight from Earth is uncertain . Estimates range from 24 ° to 72 ° . 
 The high levels of chromospheric activity , strong magnetic field , and relatively fast rotation rate of Epsilon Eridani are characteristic of a young star . The age of Epsilon Eridani is about 440 million years , but this remains subject to debate . Most age estimation methods place it in the range from 200 million to 800 million years . However , the low abundance of heavy elements in the chromosphere of Epsilon Eridani is indicative of an older star , because the medium out of which stars form is steadily enriched by heavier elements produced by older generations of stars . This anomaly might be caused by a diffusion process that has transported some of the helium and heavier elements out of the photosphere and into a region below Epsilon Eridani 's convection zone . 
 The X @-@ ray luminosity of Epsilon Eridani is about 2 × 1028 ergs / s ( 2 × 1021 W ) . It is brighter in X @-@ ray emission than the Sun at peak activity . The source for this strong X @-@ ray emission is Epsilon Eridani 's hot corona . Epsilon Eridani 's corona appears larger and hotter than the Sun 's , with a temperature of 3 @.@ 4 × 106 K as measured from observation of the corona 's ultraviolet and X @-@ ray emission . 
 The stellar wind emitted by Epsilon Eridani expands until it collides with the surrounding interstellar medium of sparse gas and dust , resulting in a bubble of heated hydrogen gas . The absorption spectrum from this gas has been measured with the Hubble Space Telescope , allowing the properties of the stellar wind to be estimated . Epsilon Eridani 's hot corona results in a mass loss rate from Epsilon Eridani 's stellar wind that is 30 times higher than the Sun 's . This wind is generating an astrosphere ( the equivalent of the heliosphere that surrounds the Sun ) that spans about 8 @,@ 000 AU and contains a bow shock that lies 1 @,@ 600 AU from Epsilon Eridani . At its estimated distance from Earth , this astrosphere spans 42 arcminutes , which is wider than the apparent size of the full Moon . 
 = = = Kinematics = = = 
 Epsilon Eridani has a high proper motion , moving − 0 @.@ 976 arcseconds per year in right ascension ( the celestial longitude ) and 0 @.@ 018 arcseconds per year in declination ( the celestial latitude ) , for a total proper motion of 0 @.@ 962 arcseconds per year . It has a radial velocity of + 15 @.@ 5 km / s away from the Sun . The space velocity components of Epsilon Eridani in the galactic coordinate system are ( U , V , W ) = ( − 3 , + 7 , − 20 ) km / s , which means that it is traveling within the Milky Way at a mean <unk> distance of 28 @.@ 7 kly ( 8 @.@ 79 kiloparsecs ) from the core along an orbit that has an eccentricity of 0 @.@ 09 . The velocity and heading of Epsilon Eridani indicate that it may be a member of the Ursa Major Moving Group that share a common motion through space . This behavior suggests that the members originated in an open cluster that has since diffused . The estimated age of this group is 500 ± 100 million years , which lies within the range of the age estimates for Epsilon Eridani . 
 During the past million years , three stars are believed to have come within 7 ly ( 2 parsecs ) of Epsilon Eridani . The most recent and closest of these encounters was with Kapteyn 's Star , which approached to a distance of about 3 ly ( 0 @.@ 9 parsecs ) roughly 12 @,@ 500 years ago . The other two stars were Sirius and Ross 614 . None of these encounters are thought to have affected the circumstellar disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani . 
 Epsilon Eridani made its closest approach to the Sun about 105 @,@ 000 years ago , when they were separated by 7 ly ( 2 @.@ 1 parsecs ) . Based upon a simulation of close encounters with nearby stars , the binary star system Luyten 726 @-@ 8 , which includes the variable star UV Ceti , will encounter Epsilon Eridani in approximately 31 @,@ 500 years at a minimum distance of about 0 @.@ 9 ly ( 0 @.@ 29 parsecs ) . They will be less than 1 ly ( 0 @.@ 3 parsecs ) apart for about 4 @,@ 600 years . If Epsilon Eridani has an Oort cloud , Luyten 726 @-@ 8 could gravitationally perturb some of the comets with long orbital periods . 
 = = Planetary system = = 
 = = = Dust disk = = = 
 Observations with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope at a wavelength of 850 μm show an extended flux of radiation out to an angular radius of 35 arcseconds around Epsilon Eridani . The peak emission occurs at an angular radius of 18 arcseconds , which corresponds to a radius of about 60 AU . The highest level of emission occurs over the radius 35 – 75 AU from Epsilon Eridani and is substantially reduced inside 30 AU . This emission is interpreted as coming from a young analogue of the Solar System 's Kuiper belt : a compact dusty disk structure surrounding Epsilon Eridani . From Earth , this belt is viewed at an inclination of roughly 25 ° to the line of sight . 
 Dust and possibly water ice from this belt migrates inward because of drag from the stellar wind and a process by which stellar radiation causes dust grains to slowly spiral toward Epsilon Eridani , known as the Poynting – Robertson effect . At the same time , these dust particles can be destroyed through mutual collisions . The time scale for all of the dust in the disk to be cleared away by these processes is less than Epsilon Eridani 's estimated age . Hence , the current dust disk must have been created by collisions or other effects of larger parent bodies , and the disk represents a late stage in the planet @-@ formation process . It would have required collisions between 11 Earth masses ' worth of parent bodies to have maintained the disk in its current state over its estimated age . 
 The disk contains an estimated mass of dust equal to a sixth of the mass of the Moon , with individual dust grains exceeding 3 @.@ 5 μm in size at a temperature of about 55 K. This dust is being generated by the collision of comets , which range up to 10 to 30 km in diameter and have a combined mass of 5 to 9 times that of Earth . This is similar to the estimated 10 Earth masses in the primordial Kuiper belt . However , the disk around Epsilon Eridani contains less than 2 @.@ 2 × 1017 kg of carbon monoxide . This low level suggests a paucity of volatile @-@ bearing comets and icy planetesimals compared to the Kuiper belt . 
 The clumpy structure of the dust belt may be explained by gravitational perturbation from a planet , dubbed Epsilon Eridani b . The clumps in the dust occur at orbits that have an integer resonance with the orbit of the suspected planet . For example , the region of the disk that completes two orbits for every three orbits of a planet is in a 3 : 2 orbital resonance . In computer simulations the ring morphology can be reproduced by the capture of dust particles in 5 : 3 and 3 : 2 orbital resonances with a planet that has an orbital eccentricity of about 0 @.@ 3 . Alternatively , the clumpiness may have been caused by collisions between minor planets known as plutinos . 
 Observations from NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope suggest that Epsilon Eridani actually has two asteroid belts and a cloud of exozodiacal dust . The latter is an analog of the zodiacal dust that occupies the plane of the Solar System . One belt sits at approximately the same position as the one in the Solar System , orbiting at a distance of 3 @.@ 00 ± 0 @.@ 75 AU from Epsilon Eridani , and consists of silicate grains with a diameter of 3 μm and a combined mass of about 1018 kg . If the planet Epsilon Eridani b exists then this belt is unlikely to have had a source outside the orbit of the planet , so the dust may have been created by fragmentation and cratering of larger bodies such as asteroids . The second , denser belt , most likely also populated by asteroids , lies between the first belt and the outer comet disk . The structure of the belts and the dust disk suggests that more than two planets in the Epsilon Eridani system are needed to maintain this configuration . 
 In an alternative scenario , the exozodiacal dust may be generated in an outer belt that is orbiting between 55 and 90 AU from Epsilon Eridani and has an assumed mass of 10 − 3 times the mass of Earth . This dust is then transported inward past the orbit of Epsilon Eridani b . When collisions between the dust grains are taken into account , the dust will reproduce the observed infrared spectrum and brightness . Outside the radius of ice sublimation , located beyond 10 AU from Epsilon Eridani where the temperatures fall below 100 K , the best fit to the observations occurs when a mix of ice and silicate dust is assumed . Inside this radius , the dust must consist of silicate grains that lack volatiles . 
 The inner region around Epsilon Eridani , from a radius of 2 @.@ 5 AU inward , appears to be clear of dust down to the detection limit of the 6 @.@ 5 m MMT telescope . Grains of dust in this region are efficiently removed by drag from the stellar wind , while the presence of a planetary system may also help keep this area clear of debris . Still , this does not preclude the possibility that an inner asteroid belt may be present with a combined mass no greater than the asteroid belt in the Solar System . 
 = = = Possible planets = = = 
 As one of the nearest Sun @-@ like stars , Epsilon Eridani has been the target of many attempts to search for planetary companions . However , its chromospheric activity and variability means that finding planets with the radial velocity method is difficult , because the stellar activity may create signals that mimic the presence of planets . Attempts at direct imaging of potential exoplanets have proven unsuccessful to date . 
 Infrared observation has shown there are no bodies of three or more Jupiter masses in this system , out to at least a distance of 500 AU from the host star . Planets with similar masses and temperatures as Jupiter should be detectable by Spitzer at distances beyond 80 AU , but none has been discovered in this range . Planets more than 150 % as massive as Jupiter can be ruled out at the inner edge of the debris disk at 30 − 35 AU . 
 = = = = Planet b = = = = 
 Referred to as Epsilon Eridani b , this planet was announced in 2000 , but the discovery has remained controversial . A comprehensive study in 2008 called the detection " tentative " and described the proposed planet as " long suspected but still unconfirmed " . However , many astronomers believed the evidence is sufficiently compelling that they regard the discovery as confirmed . As of 2013 , the discovery remains in doubt because a search program at La Silla Observatory did not confirm it exists . 
 Published sources remain in disagreement as to the proposed planet 's basic parameters . Values for its orbital period range from 6 @.@ 85 to 7 @.@ 2 years . Estimates of the size of its elliptical orbit — the semimajor axis — range from 3 @.@ 38 AU to 3 @.@ 50 AU and approximations of its orbital eccentricity range from 0 @.@ 25 ± 0 @.@ 23 to 0 @.@ 702 ± 0 @.@ 039 . 
 The true mass of this planet remains unknown , but it can be estimated based on the displacement effect of the planet 's gravity on Epsilon Eridani . Only the component of the displacement along the line of sight to Earth is known , which yields a value for the formula m sin i , where m is the mass of the planet and i is the orbital inclination . Estimates for the value of m sin i range from 0 @.@ 60 Jupiter masses to 1 @.@ 06 Jupiter masses , which sets the lower limit for the mass of the planet ( because the sine function has a maximum value of 1 ) . By choosing a mass of 0 @.@ 78 and an estimated inclination of 30 ° , this yields the frequently cited value of 1 @.@ 55 ± 0 @.@ 24 Jupiter masses for the planet 's mass . 
 Of all the measured parameters for this planet , the value for orbital eccentricity is the most uncertain . The frequently cited value of 0 @.@ 7 for Epsilon Eridani b 's eccentricity is inconsistent with the presence of the proposed asteroid belt at a distance of 3 AU . If the eccentricity was actually this high , the planet would pass through the asteroid belt and clear it out within about ten thousand years . If the belt has existed for longer than this period , which appears likely , it imposes an upper limit on Epsilon Eridani b 's eccentricity of about 0 @.@ 10 – 0 @.@ 15 . If the dust disk is instead being generated from the outer debris disk , rather than from collisions in an asteroid belt , then no constraints on the planet 's orbital eccentricity are needed to explain the dust distribution . 
 The planet and its host star is one of the planetary systems selected by the International Astronomical Union as part of their public process for giving proper names to exoplanets and their host star ( where no proper name already exists ) . The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names . In December 2015 , the IAU announced the winning names were Ran for the star and <unk> for the planet , both names from Norse mythology . 
 = = = = Planet c = = = = 
 Computer simulations of the dusty disk orbiting Epsilon Eridani suggest that the shape of the disk may be explained by the presence of a second planet , tentatively dubbed Epsilon Eridani c . <unk> in the dust disk may occur because dust particles are being trapped in orbits that have resonant orbital periods with a planet in an eccentric orbit . The postulated Epsilon Eridani c would orbit at a distance of 40 AU , with an eccentricity of 0 @.@ 3 and a period of 280 years . The inner cavity of the disk may be explained by the presence of additional planets . Current models of planet formation cannot easily explain how a planet could have been created at this distance from Epsilon Eridani . The disk is expected to have dissipated long before a giant planet could have formed . Instead , the planet may have formed at an orbital distance of about 10 AU then migrated outward because of gravitational interaction with the disc or with other planets in the system .

 Epsilon Eridani is a target for planet finding programs because it has properties that allow an Earth @-@ like planet to form . Although this system was not chosen as a primary candidate for the now @-@ canceled Terrestrial Planet Finder , it was a target star for NASA 's proposed Space Interferometry Mission to search for Earth @-@ sized planets . The proximity , Sun @-@ like properties and suspected planets of Epsilon Eridani have also made it the subject of multiple studies on whether an interstellar probe can be sent to Epsilon Eridani . 
 The orbital radius at which the stellar flux from Epsilon Eridani matches the solar constant — where the emission matches the Sun 's output at the orbital distance of the Earth — is 0 @.@ 61 astronomical units ( AU ) . That is within the maximum habitable zone of a conjectured Earth @-@ like planet orbiting Epsilon Eridani , which currently stretches from about 0 @.@ 5 to 1 @.@ 0 AU . As Epsilon Eridani ages over a period of 20 billion years , the net luminosity will increase , causing this zone to slowly expand outward to about 0 @.@ 6 – 1 @.@ 4 AU . However , the presence of a large planet with a highly elliptical orbit in proximity to Epsilon Eridani 's habitable zone reduces the likelihood of a terrestrial planet having a stable orbit within the habitable zone . 
 A young star such as Epsilon Eridani can produce large amounts of ultraviolet radiation that may be harmful to life . The orbital radius where the UV flux matches that on the early Earth lies at just under 0 @.@ 5 AU . Epsilon Eridani 's proximity , Sun @-@ like properties and suspected planets have made it a destination for interstellar travel in science fiction stories . 
 From Epsilon Eridani , the Sun would appear as a 2 @.@ 4 @-@ magnitude star in Serpens . 
 = Aleister Crowley = 
 Aleister Crowley ( / <unk> / ; born Edward Alexander Crowley ; 12 October 1875 – 1 December 1947 ) was an English occultist , ceremonial magician , poet , painter , novelist , and mountaineer . He founded the religion and philosophy of Thelema , identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the Æon of Horus in the early 20th century . 
 Born to a wealthy Plymouth Brethren family in Royal Leamington Spa , Warwickshire , Crowley rejected this fundamentalist Christian faith to pursue an interest in Western esotericism . He was educated at the University of Cambridge , where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry , resulting in several publications . Some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a British intelligence agency , further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life . In 1898 he joined the esoteric Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , where he was trained in ceremonial magic by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and Allan Bennett . Moving to Boleskine House by Loch Ness in Scotland , he went mountaineering in Mexico with Oscar Eckenstein , before studying Hindu and Buddhist practices in India . He married Rose Edith Kelly and in 1904 they honeymooned in Cairo , Egypt , where Crowley claimed to have been contacted by a supernatural entity named Aiwass , who provided him with The Book of the Law , a sacred text that served as the basis for Thelema . Announcing the start of the Æon of Horus , The Book declared that its followers should adhere to the code of " Do what thou wilt " and seek to align themselves with their Will through the practice of magick . 
 After an unsuccessful attempt to climb Kanchenjunga and a visit to India and China , Crowley returned to Britain , where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry , novels , and occult literature . In 1907 , he and George Cecil Jones co @-@ founded a Thelemite order , the A ∴ A ∴ , through which they propagated the religion . After spending time in Algeria , in 1912 he was initiated into another esoteric order , the German @-@ based Ordo Templi Orientis ( O.T.O. ) , rising to become the leader of its British branch , which he reformulated in accordance with his Thelemite beliefs . Through the O.T.O. , Thelemite groups were established in Britain , Australia , and North America . Crowley spent the First World War in the United States , where he took up painting and campaigned for the German war effort against Britain , later revealing that he had infiltrated the pro @-@ German movement to assist the British intelligence services . In 1920 he established the Abbey of Thelema , a religious commune in Cefalù , Sicily where he lived with various followers . His libertine lifestyle led to denunciations in the British press , and the Italian government evicted him in 1923 . He divided the following two decades between France , Germany , and England , and continued to promote Thelema until his death . 
 Crowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime , being a recreational drug experimenter , bisexual and an individualist social critic . He was denounced in the popular press as " the wickedest man in the world " and a Satanist . Crowley has remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism and the counter @-@ culture , and continues to be considered a prophet in Thelema . In 2002 , a BBC poll ranked him as the seventy @-@ third greatest Briton of all time .

 = = = Youth : 1875 – 94 = = = 
 Crowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in Royal Leamington Spa , Warwickshire , on 12 October 1875 . His father , Edward Crowley ( 1834 – 87 ) , was trained as an engineer , but his share in a lucrative family brewing business , Crowley 's Alton Ales , had allowed him to retire before his son was born . His mother , Emily Bertha Bishop ( 1848 – 1917 ) , came from a Devonshire @-@ Somerset family and had a strained relationship with her son ; she described him as " the Beast " , a name that he revelled in . The couple had been married at London 's Kensington Registry Office in November 1874 , and were evangelical Christians . Crowley 's father had been born a Quaker , but had converted to the Exclusive Brethren , a faction of a Christian fundamentalist group known as the Plymouth Brethren , with Emily joining him upon marriage . Crowley 's father was particularly devout , spending his time as a travelling preacher for the sect and reading a chapter from the Bible to his wife and son after breakfast every day . Following the death of their baby daughter in 1880 , in 1881 the <unk> moved to Redhill , Surrey . At the age of 8 , Crowley was sent to H.T. Habershon 's evangelical Christian boarding school in Hastings , and then to Ebor preparatory school in Cambridge , run by the Reverend Henry d 'Arcy Champney , whom Crowley considered a sadist . 
 In March 1887 , when Crowley was 11 , his father died of tongue cancer . Crowley described this as a turning point in his life , and he always maintained an admiration of his father , describing him as " his hero and his friend " . Inheriting a third of his father 's wealth , he began misbehaving at school and was harshly punished by Champney ; Crowley 's family removed him from the school when he developed albuminuria . He then attended Malvern College and Tonbridge School , both of which he despised and left after a few terms . He became increasingly sceptical regarding Christianity , pointing out inconsistencies in the Bible to his religious teachers , and went against the Christian morality of his upbringing by smoking , masturbating , and having sex with prostitutes from whom he contracted gonorrhea . Sent to live with a Brethren tutor in Eastbourne , he undertook chemistry courses at Eastbourne College . Crowley developed interests in chess , poetry , and mountain climbing , and in 1894 climbed Beachy Head before visiting the Alps and joining the Scottish Mountaineering Club . The following year he returned to the Bernese Alps , climbing the Eiger , <unk> , Jungfrau , Mönch , and <unk> . 
 = = = Cambridge University : 1895 – 98 = = = 
 Having adopted the name of Aleister over Edward , in October 1895 Crowley began a three @-@ year course at Trinity College , Cambridge , where he was entered for the Moral Science Tripos studying philosophy . With approval from his personal tutor , he changed to English literature , which was not then part of the curriculum offered . Crowley spent much of his time at university engaged in his pastimes , becoming president of the chess club and practising the game for two hours a day ; he briefly considered a professional career as a chess player . Crowley also embraced his love of literature and poetry , particularly the works of Richard Francis Burton and Percy Bysshe Shelley . Many of his own poems appeared in student publications such as The Granta , Cambridge Magazine , and <unk> . He continued his mountaineering , going on holiday to the Alps to climb every year from 1894 to 1898 , often with his friend Oscar Eckenstein , and in 1897 he made the first ascent of the Mönch without a guide . These feats led to his recognition in the Alpine mountaineering community . 
 Crowley had his first significant mystical experience while on holiday in Stockholm in December 1896 . Several biographers , including Lawrence Sutin , Richard Kaczynski , and Tobias Churton , believed that this was the result of Crowley 's first same @-@ sex sexual experience , which enabled him to recognise his bisexuality . At Cambridge , Crowley maintained a vigorous sex life , largely with female prostitutes , from one of whom he caught syphilis , but eventually he took part in same @-@ sex activities , despite their illegality . In October 1897 , Crowley met Herbert Charles Pollitt , president of the Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club , and the two entered into a relationship . They broke apart because Pollitt did not share Crowley 's increasing interest in Western esotericism , a breakup that Crowley would regret for many years . 
 In 1897 , Crowley travelled to St Petersburg in Russia , later claiming that he was trying to learn Russian as he was considering a future diplomatic career there . Biographers Richard Spence and Tobias Churton suggested that Crowley had done so as an intelligence agent under the employ of the British secret service , speculating that he had been enlisted while at Cambridge . 
 In October 1897 , a brief illness triggered considerations of mortality and " the futility of all human endeavour " , and Crowley abandoned all thoughts of a diplomatic career in favour of pursuing an interest in the occult . In March 1898 , he obtained A.E. Waite 's The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts ( 1898 ) , and then Karl von <unk> 's The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary ( 1896 ) , furthering his occult interests . In 1898 Crowley privately published 100 copies of his poem <unk> : A Place to Bury Strangers In , but it was not a particular success . That same year he published a string of other poems , including White Stains , a Decadent collection of erotic poetry that was printed abroad lest its publication be prohibited by the British authorities . In July 1898 , he left Cambridge , not having taken any degree at all despite a " first class " showing in his 1897 exams and consistent " second class honours " results before that . 
 = = = The Golden Dawn : 1898 – 99 = = = 
 In August 1898 , Crowley was in Zermatt , Switzerland , where he met the chemist Julian L. Baker , and the two began discussing their common interest in alchemy . Back in London , Baker introduced Crowley to George Cecil Jones , Baker 's brother in @-@ law , and a fellow member of the occult society known as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , which had been founded in 1888 . Crowley was initiated into the Outer Order of the Golden Dawn on 18 November 1898 by the group 's leader , Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers . The ceremony took place in the Golden Dawn 's Isis @-@ Urania Temple held at London 's Mark Masons Hall , where Crowley took the magical motto and name " Frater <unk> " , which he interpreted as " I shall endure to the end " . Biographers Richard Spence and Tobias Churton have suggested that Crowley joined the Order under the command of the British secret services to monitor the activities of Mathers , who was known to be a Carlist . 
 Crowley moved into his own luxury flat at 67 – 69 Chancery Lane and soon invited a senior Golden Dawn member , Allan Bennett , to live with him as his personal magical tutor . Bennett taught Crowley more about ceremonial magic and the ritual use of drugs , and together they performed the rituals of the Goetia , until Bennett left for South Asia to study Buddhism . In November 1899 , Crowley purchased Boleskine House in <unk> on the shore of Loch Ness in Scotland . He developed a love of Scottish culture , describing himself as the " Laird of Boleskine " , and took to wearing traditional highland dress , even during visits to London . He continued writing poetry , publishing Jezebel and Other Tragic Poems , Tales of <unk> , Songs of the Spirit , Appeal to the American Republic , and Jephthah in 1898 – 99 ; most gained mixed reviews from literary critics , although Jephthah was considered a particular critical success . 
 Crowley soon progressed through the lower grades of the Golden Dawn , and was ready to enter the group 's inner Second Order . He was unpopular in the group ; his bisexuality and libertine lifestyle had gained him a bad reputation , and he had developed feuds with some of the members , including W.B. Yeats . When the Golden Dawn 's London lodge refused to initiate Crowley into the Second Order , he visited Mathers in Paris , who personally admitted him into the <unk> Minor Grade . A schism had developed between Mathers and the London members of the Golden Dawn , who were unhappy with his autocratic rule . Acting under Mathers ' orders , Crowley – with the help of his mistress and fellow initiate Elaine Simpson – attempted to seize the Vault of the Adepts , a temple space at 36 Blythe Road in West Kensington , from the London lodge members . When the case was taken to court , the judge ruled in favour of the London lodge , as they had paid for the space 's rent , leaving both Crowley and Mathers isolated from the group . Spence suggested that the entire scenario was part of an intelligence operation to undermine Mathers ' authority . 
 = = = Mexico , India , Paris , and marriage : 1900 – 03 = = = 
 In 1900 , Crowley travelled to Mexico via the United States , settling in Mexico City and taking a local woman as his mistress . Developing a love of the country , he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic , working with John Dee 's Enochian invocations . He later claimed to have been initiated into Freemasonry while there , and he wrote a play based on Richard Wagner 's Tannhäuser as well as a series of poems , published as Oracles ( 1905 ) . Eckenstein joined him later that year , and together they climbed several mountains , including <unk> , <unk> , and Colima , the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption . Spence has suggested that the purpose of the trip might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence . Leaving Mexico , Crowley headed to San Francisco before sailing for Hawaii aboard the Nippon Maru . On the ship he had a brief affair with a married woman named Mary Alice Rogers ; saying he had fallen in love with her , he wrote a series of poems about the romance , published as Alice : An Adultery ( 1903 ) . 
 Briefly stopping in Japan and Hong Kong , Crowley reached Ceylon , where he met with Allan Bennett , who was there studying Shaivism . The pair spent some time in Kandy before Bennett decided to become a Buddhist monk in the Theravada tradition , travelling to Burma to do so . Crowley decided to tour India , devoting himself to the Hindu practice of raja yoga , from which he claimed to have achieved the spiritual state of dhyana . He spent much of this time studying at the Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madura . At this time he also composed and also wrote poetry which was published as The Sword of Song ( 1904 ) . He contracted malaria , and had to recuperate from the disease in Calcutta and Rangoon . In 1902 , he was joined in India by Eckenstein and several other mountaineers : Guy Knowles , H. <unk> , V. <unk> , and Jules Jacot @-@ <unk> . Together the Eckenstein @-@ Crowley expedition attempted K2 , which had never been climbed . On the journey , Crowley was afflicted with influenza , malaria , and snow blindness , and other expedition members were also struck with illness . They reached an altitude of 20 @,@ 000 feet ( 6 @,@ 100 m ) before turning back . 
 Having arrived in Paris in November 1902 he socialised with friend and future brother @-@ in @-@ law , the painter Gerald Kelly , and through him became a fixture of the Parisian arts scene . Whilst there , Crowley authored a series of poems on the work of an acquaintance , the sculptor Auguste Rodin . These poems were later published as Rodin in Rime ( 1907 ) . One of those frequenting this milieu was W. Somerset Maugham , who after briefly meeting Crowley later used him as a model for the character of Oliver Haddo in his novel The Magician ( 1908 ) . Returning to Boleskine in April 1903 , in August Crowley wed Gerald 's sister Rose Edith Kelly in a " marriage of convenience " to prevent her entering an arranged marriage ; the marriage appalled the Kelly family and damaged his friendship with Gerald . Heading on a honeymoon to Paris , Cairo , and then Ceylon , Crowley fell in love with Rose and worked to prove his affections . While on his honeymoon , he wrote her a series of love poems , published as Rosa Mundi and other Love Songs ( 1906 ) , as well as authoring the religious satire Why Jesus Wept ( 1904 ) .

 In February 1904 , Crowley and Rose arrived in Cairo . Claiming to be a prince and princess , they rented an apartment in which Crowley set up a temple room and began invoking ancient Egyptian deities , while studying Islamic mysticism and Arabic . According to Crowley 's later account , Rose regularly became delirious and informed him " they are waiting for you " . On 18 March , she explained that " they " were the god Horus , and on 20 March proclaimed that " the Equinox of the Gods has come " . She led him to a nearby museum , where she showed him a seventh @-@ century BCE mortuary stele known as the Stele of Ankh @-@ ef @-@ en @-@ Khonsu ; Crowley thought it important that the exhibit 's number was 666 , the number of the beast in Christian belief , and in later years termed the artefact the " Stele of Revealing . " 
 According to Crowley 's later statements , on 8 April he heard a disembodied voice that claimed to be that of Aiwass , the messenger of Horus , or Hoor @-@ Paar @-@ <unk> . Crowley said that he wrote down everything the voice told him over the course of the next three days , and titled it Liber L vel Legis or The Book of the Law . The book proclaimed that humanity was entering a new Aeon , and that Crowley would serve as its prophet . It stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this Aeon , " Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law , " and that people should learn to live in tune with their Will . This book , and the philosophy that it espoused , became the cornerstone of Crowley 's religion , Thelema . Crowley said that at the time he had been unsure what to do with The Book of the Law . Often resenting it , he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform , which included taking the Stele of Revealing from the museum , fortifying his own island , and translating the book into all the world 's languages . According to his account , he instead sent typescripts of the work to several occultists he knew , putting the manuscript away and ignoring it . 
 = = = Kangchenjunga and China : 1905 – 06 = = = 
 Returning to Boleskine , Crowley came to believe that Mathers had begun using magic against him , and the relationship between the two broke down . On 28 July 1905 , Rose gave birth to Crowley 's first child , a daughter named Lilith , with Crowley authoring the pornographic <unk> From a Curate 's Garden to entertain his recuperating wife . He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry , naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge . Among its first publications were Crowley 's Collected Works , edited by Ivor Back . His poetry often received strong reviews ( either positive or negative ) , but never sold well . In an attempt to gain more publicity , he issued a reward of £ 100 for the best essay on his work . The winner of this was J. F. C. Fuller , a British Army officer and military historian , whose essay , The Star in the West ( 1907 ) , heralded Crowley 's poetry as some of the greatest ever written . 
 Crowley decided to climb Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas of Nepal , widely recognised as the world 's most treacherous mountain . Assembling a team consisting of Jacot @-@ <unk> , Charles Adolphe Reymond , Alexis Pache , and <unk> C. Rigo de Righi , the expedition was marred by much argument between Crowley and the others , who thought that he was reckless . They eventually mutinied against Crowley 's control , with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley 's warnings that it was too dangerous . Subsequently , Pache and several porters were killed in an accident , something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community . 
 Spending time in <unk> , where he took part in big game hunting and wrote the homoerotic work The Scented Garden , Crowley met up with Rose and Lilith in Calcutta before being forced to leave India after shooting dead a native man who tried to mug him . Briefly visiting Bennett in Burma , Crowley and his family decided to tour Southern China , hiring porters and a nanny for the purpose . Spence has suggested that this trip to China was orchestrated as part of a British intelligence scheme to monitor the region 's opium trade . Crowley smoked opium throughout the journey , which took the family from <unk> through to <unk> , Tali , <unk> , and then Hanoi . On the way he spent much time on spiritual and magical work , reciting the " <unk> Ritual " , an invocation to his Holy Guardian Angel , on a daily basis . 
 While Rose and Lilith returned to Europe , Crowley headed to Shanghai to meet old friend Elaine Simpson , who was fascinated by The Book of the Law ; together they performed rituals in an attempt to contact Aiwass . Crowley then sailed to Japan and Canada , before continuing to New York City , where he unsuccessfully solicited support for a second expedition up Kangchenjunga . Upon arrival in Britain , Crowley learned that his daughter Lilith had died of typhoid in Rangoon , something he later blamed on Rose 's increasing alcoholism . Under emotional distress , his health began to suffer , and he underwent a series of surgical operations . He began short @-@ lived romances with actress Vera " Lola " Neville ( née <unk> ) and author Ada Leverson , while Rose gave birth to Crowley 's second daughter , Lola Zaza , in February 1907 . 
 = = = The A ∴ A ∴ and the Holy Books of Thelema : 1907 – 09 = = = 
 With his old mentor George Cecil Jones , Crowley continued performing the <unk> rituals at the Ashdown Park Hotel in Coulsdon , Surrey . Crowley claimed that in doing so he attained samadhi , or union with Godhead , thereby marking a turning point in his life . Making heavy use of hashish during these rituals , he wrote an essay on " The Psychology of Hashish " ( 1909 ) in which he championed the drug as an aid to mysticism . He also claimed to have been contacted once again by Aiwass in late October and November 1907 , adding that Aiwass dictated two further texts to him , " Liber VII " and " Liber <unk> <unk> Serpente " , both of which were later classified in the corpus of Holy Books of Thelema . Crowley wrote down more Thelemic Holy Books during the last two months of the year , including " Liber <unk> " , " Liber <unk> " , " Liber Porta <unk> , Sub <unk> X " , " Liber Tau " , " Liber <unk> " and " Liber <unk> vel <unk> " , which he again claimed to have received from a preternatural source . Crowley stated that in June 1909 , when the manuscript of The Book of the Law was rediscovered at Boleskine , he developed the opinion that Thelema represented objective truth . 
 Crowley 's inheritance was running out . Trying to earn money , he was hired by George Montagu Bennett , the Earl of Tankerville , to help protect him from witchcraft ; recognising Bennett 's paranoia as being based in his cocaine addiction , Crowley took him on holiday to France and Morocco to recuperate . In 1907 , he also began taking in paying students , whom he instructed in occult and magical practice . Victor Neuburg , whom Crowley met in February 1907 , became his sexual partner and closest disciple ; in 1908 the pair toured northern Spain before heading to Tangier , Morocco . The following year Neuburg stayed at Boleskine , where he and Crowley engaged in sadomasochism . Crowley continued to write prolifically , producing such works of poetry as Ambergris , Clouds Without Water , and <unk> Om Pax , as well as his first attempt at an autobiography , The World 's Tragedy . Recognising the popularity of short horror stories , Crowley wrote his own , some of which were published , and he also published several articles in Vanity Fair , a magazine edited by his friend Frank Harris . He also wrote Liber 777 , a book of magical and Qabalistic correspondences that borrowed from Mathers and Bennett . 
 In November 1907 , Crowley and Jones decided to found an occult order to act as a successor to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn , being aided in doing so by Fuller . The result was the A ∴ A ∴ . The group 's headquarters and temple were situated at 124 Victoria Street in central London , and their rites borrowed much from those of the Golden Dawn , but with an added Thelemic basis . Its earliest members included solicitor Richard Noel Warren , artist Austin Osman Spare , Horace Sheridan @-@ <unk> , author George <unk> , Francis Henry Everard Joseph Feilding , engineer Herbert Edward Inman , Kenneth Ward , and Charles Stansfeld Jones . In March 1909 , Crowley began production of a biannual periodical titled The Equinox . He billed this periodical , which was to become the " Official Organ " of the A ∴ A ∴ , as " The Review of Scientific <unk> " . 
 Crowley had become increasingly frustrated with Rose 's alcoholism , and in November 1909 he divorced her on the grounds of his own adultery . Lola was entrusted to Rose 's care ; the couple remained friends and Rose continued to live at Boleskine . Her alcoholism worsened , and as a result she was institutionalised in September 1911 . 
 = = = Algeria and the Rites of Eleusis : 1909 – 11 = = = 
 In November 1909 , Crowley and Neuburg travelled to Algeria , touring the desert from El Arba to Aumale , Bou <unk> , and then <unk> <unk> <unk> , with Crowley reciting the Quran on a daily basis . During the trip he invoked the thirty <unk> of Enochian magic , with Neuburg recording the results , later published in The Equinox as The Vision and the Voice . Following a mountaintop sex magic ritual , Crowley also performed an invocation to the demon Choronzon involving blood sacrifice , considering the results to be a watershed in his magical career . Returning to London in January 1910 , Crowley found that Mathers was suing him for publishing Golden Dawn secrets in The Equinox ; the court found in favour of Crowley . The case was widely reported in the press , with Crowley gaining wider fame . Crowley enjoyed this , and played up to the sensationalist stereotype of being a Satanist and advocate of human sacrifice , despite being neither . 
 The publicity attracted new members to the A ∴ A ∴ , among them Frank Bennett , James Bayley , Herbert Close , and James <unk> . The Australian violinist Leila Waddell soon became Crowley 's lover . Deciding to expand his teachings to a wider audience , Crowley developed the Rites of Artemis , a public performance of magic and symbolism featuring A ∴ A ∴ members personifying various deities . It was first performed at the A ∴ A ∴ headquarters , with attendees given a fruit punch containing peyote to enhance their experience . Various members of the press attended , and reported largely positively on it . In October and November 1910 , Crowley decided to stage something similar , the Rites of Eleusis , at Caxton Hall , Westminster ; this time press reviews were mixed . Crowley came under particular criticism from West de <unk> Fenton , editor of The Looking Glass newspaper , who called him " one of the most blasphemous and cold @-@ blooded villains of modern times " . Fenton 's articles suggested that Crowley and Jones were involved in homosexual activity ; Crowley did not mind , but Jones unsuccessfully sued for libel . Fuller broke off his friendship and involvement with Crowley over the scandal , and Crowley and Neuburg returned to Algeria for further magical workings . 
 The Equinox continued publishing , and various books of literature and poetry were also published under its imprint , like Crowley 's Ambergris , The Winged Beetle , and The Scented Garden , as well as Neuburg 's The Triumph of Pan and Ethel Archer 's The Whirlpool . In 1911 , Crowley and Waddell holidayed in Montigny @-@ sur @-@ Loing , where he wrote prolifically , producing poems , short stories , plays , and 19 works on magic and mysticism , including the two final Holy Books of Thelema . In Paris , he met Mary Desti , who became his next " Scarlet Woman " , with the two undertaking magical workings in St. Moritz ; Crowley believed that one of the Secret Chiefs , Ab @-@ ul @-@ Diz , was speaking through her . Based on Desti 's statements when in trance , Crowley wrote the two @-@ volume Book 4 ( 1912 – 13 ) and at the time developed the spelling " magick " in reference to the paranormal phenomenon as a means of distinguishing it from the stage magic of illusionists . 
 = = = Ordo Templi Orientis and the Paris Working : 1912 – 14 = = = 
 In early 1912 , Crowley published The Book of Lies , a work of mysticism that biographer Lawrence Sutin described as " his greatest success in merging his talents as poet , scholar , and magus " . The German occultist Theodor Reuss later accused him of publishing some of the secrets of his own occult order , the Ordo Templi Orientis ( O.T.O. ) , within The Book . Crowley convinced Reuss that the similarities were coincidental , and the two became friends . Reuss appointed Crowley as head of the O.T.O 's British branch , the Mysteria Mystica Maxima ( MMM ) , and at a ceremony in Berlin Crowley adopted the magical name of Baphomet and was proclaimed " X ° Supreme Rex and Sovereign Grand Master General of Ireland , Iona , and all the Britons " . With Reuss ' permission , Crowley set about advertising the MMM and re @-@ writing many O.T.O. rituals , which were then based largely on Freemasonry ; his incorporation of Thelemite elements proved controversial in the group . Fascinated by the O.T.O 's emphasis on sex magic , Crowley devised a magical working based on anal sex and incorporated it into the syllabus for those O.T.O. members who had been initiated into the eleventh degree . 
 In March 1913 Crowley acted as producer for The Ragged Ragtime Girls , a group of female violinists led by Waddell , as they performed at London 's Old Tivoli theatre . They subsequently performed in Moscow for six weeks , where Crowley had a sadomasochistic relationship with the Hungarian Anny Ringler . In Moscow , Crowley continued to write plays and poetry , including " Hymn to Pan " , and the Gnostic Mass , a Thelemic ritual that became a key part of O.T.O. liturgy . Churton suggested that Crowley had travelled to Moscow on the orders of British intelligence to spy on revolutionary elements in the city . In January 1914 Crowley and Neuburg settled in to an apartment in Paris , where the former was involved in the controversy surrounding Jacob Epstein 's new monument to Oscar Wilde . Together Crowley and Neuburg performed the six @-@ week " Paris Working " , a period of intense ritual involving strong drug use in which they invoked the gods Mercury and Jupiter . As part of the ritual , the couple performed acts of sex magic together , at times being joined by journalist Walter Duranty . Inspired by the results of the Working , Crowley authored Liber <unk> , a treatise on sex magic . Following the Paris Working , Neuburg began to distance himself from Crowley , resulting in an argument in which Crowley cursed him . 
 = = = United States : 1914 – 19 = = = 
 By 1914 Crowley was living a hand @-@ to @-@ mouth existence , relying largely on donations from A ∴ A ∴ members and dues payments made to O.T.O. In May he transferred ownership of Boleskine House to the MMM for financial reasons , and in July he went mountaineering in the Swiss Alps . During this time the First World War broke out . After recuperating from a bout of phlebitis , Crowley set sail for the United States aboard the RMS Lusitania in October 1914 . Arriving in New York City , he moved into a hotel and began earning money writing for the American edition of Vanity Fair and undertaking freelance work for the famed astrologer Evangeline Adams . In the city , he continued experimenting with sex magic , through the use of masturbation , female prostitutes , and male clients of a Turkish bathhouse ; all of these encounters were documented in his diaries . 
 Professing to be of Irish ancestry and a supporter of Irish independence from Great Britain , Crowley began to espouse support for Germany in their war against Britain . He became involved in New York 's pro @-@ German movement , and in January 1915 German spy George Sylvester Viereck employed him as a writer for his propagandist paper , The Fatherland , which was dedicated to keeping the US neutral in the conflict . In later years , detractors denounced Crowley as a traitor to Britain for this action . In reality , Crowley was a double agent , working for the British intelligence services to infiltrate and undermine Germany 's operation in New York . Many of his articles in The Fatherland were hyperbolic , for instance comparing Kaiser Wilhelm II to Jesus Christ ; in July 1915 he orchestrated a publicity stunt – reported on by The New York Times – in which he declared independence for Ireland in front of the Statue of Liberty ; the real intention was to make the German lobby appear ridiculous in the eyes of the American public . It has been argued that he encouraged the German Navy to destroy the Lusitania , informing them that it would ensure the US stayed out of the war , while in reality hoping that it would bring the US into the war on Britain 's side . 
 Crowley entered into a relationship with Jeanne Robert Foster , with whom he toured the West Coast . In Vancouver , headquarters of the North American O.T.O. , he met with Charles Stansfeld Jones and Wilfred Talbot Smith to discuss the propagation of Thelema on the continent . In Detroit he experimented with <unk> at Parke @-@ Davis , then visited Seattle , San Francisco , Santa Cruz , Los Angeles , San Diego , Tijuana , and the Grand Canyon , before returning to New York . There he befriended Ananda Coomaraswamy and his wife Alice Richardson ; Crowley and Richardson performed sex magic in April 1916 , following which she became pregnant and then miscarried . Later that year he took a " magical retirement " to a cabin by Lake <unk> owned by Evangeline Adams . There , he made heavy use of drugs and undertook a ritual after which he proclaimed himself " Master Therion " . He also wrote several short stories based on J.G. Frazer 's The Golden Bough and a work of literary criticism , The Gospel According to Bernard Shaw . 
 In December he moved to New Orleans , his favourite US city , before spending February 1917 with evangelical Christian relatives in Titusville , Florida . Returning to New York , he moved in with artist and A ∴ A ∴ member Leon <unk> Kennedy , in May learning of his mother 's death . After the collapse of The Fatherland , Crowley continued his association with Viereck , who appointed him contributing editor of arts journal The International . Crowley used it to promote Thelema , but it soon ceased publication . He then moved to the studio apartment of <unk> Minor , who became his partner and Scarlet Woman . Through their rituals , Crowley believed that they were contacted by a preternatural entity named <unk> . The relationship soon ended . 
 In 1918 , Crowley went on a magical retreat in the wilderness of Esopus Island on the Hudson River . Here , he began a translation of the Tao Te Ching , painted Thelemic slogans on the riverside cliffs , and – he later claimed – experienced past life memories of being Ge Xuan , Pope Alexander VI , Alessandro Cagliostro , and Eliphas Levi . Back in New York , he moved to Greenwich Village , where he took Leah Hirsig as his lover and next Scarlet Woman . He took up painting as a hobby , exhibiting his work at the Greenwich Village Liberal Club and attracting the attention of the New York Evening World . With the financial assistance of sympathetic Freemasons , Crowley revived The Equinox with the first issue of volume III , known as " The Blue Equinox " . He spent mid @-@ 1919 on a climbing holiday in Montauk before returning to London in December . 
 = = = Abbey of Thelema : 1920 – 23 = = = 
 Now destitute and back in London , Crowley came under attack from the tabloid John Bull , which labelled him traitorous " scum " for his work with the German war effort ; several friends aware of his intelligence work urged him to sue , but he decided not to . When he was suffering from asthma , a doctor prescribed him heroin , to which he soon became addicted . In January 1920 , he moved to Paris , renting a house in Fontainebleau with Leah Hirsig ; they were soon joined in a ménage à trois by Ninette Shumway , and also by Leah 's newborn daughter Anne " Poupée " Leah . Crowley had ideas of forming a community of Thelemites , which he called the Abbey of Thelema after the Abbaye de Thélème in François Rabelais ' satire Gargantua and Pantagruel . After consulting the I Ching , he chose Cefalù ( on Sicily , Italy ) as a location , and after arriving there , began renting the old Villa Santa Barbara as his Abbey on 2 April . 
 Moving to the commune with Hirsig , Shumway , and their children Hansi , Howard , and Poupée , Crowley described the scenario as " perfectly happy ... my idea of heaven . " They wore robes , and performed rituals to the sun god Ra at set times during the day , also occasionally performing the Gnostic Mass ; the rest of the day they were left to follow their own interests . Undertaking widespread correspondences , Crowley continued to paint , wrote a commentary on The Book of the Law , and revised the third part of Book 4 . He offered a libertine education for the children , allowing them to play all day and witness acts of sex magic . He occasionally travelled to Palermo to visit rent boys and buy supplies , including drugs ; his heroin addiction came to dominate his life , and cocaine began to erode his nasal cavity . There was no cleaning rota , and wild dogs and cats wandered throughout the building , which soon became unsanitary . Poupée died in October 1920 , and Ninette gave birth to a daughter , Astarte Lulu <unk> , soon afterwards . 
 New followers continued to arrive at the Abbey to be taught by Crowley . Among them was film star Jane Wolfe , who arrived in July 1920 , where she was initiated into the A ∴ A ∴ and became Crowley 's secretary . Another was Cecil Frederick Russell , who often argued with Crowley , disliking the same @-@ sex sexual magic that he was required to perform , and left after a year . More conducive was the Australian Thelemite Frank Bennett , who also spent several months at the Abbey . In February 1922 , Crowley returned to Paris for a retreat in an unsuccessful attempt to kick his heroin addiction . He then went to London in search of money , where he published articles in The English Review criticising the Dangerous Drugs Act 1920 and wrote a novel , Diary of a Drug Fiend , completed in July . On publication , it received mixed reviews ; he was lambasted by the Sunday Express , which called for its burning and used its influence to prevent further reprints . 
 Subsequently , a young Thelemite named Raoul Loveday moved to the Abbey with his wife Betty May ; while Loveday was devoted to Crowley , May detested him and life at the commune . She later said that Loveday was made to drink the blood of a sacrificed cat , and that they were required to cut themselves with razors every time they used the pronoun " I " . Loveday drank from a local polluted stream , soon developing a liver infection resulting in his death in February 1923 . Returning to London , May told her story to the press . John Bull proclaimed Crowley " the wickedest man in the world " and " a man we 'd like to hang " , and although Crowley deemed many of their accusations against him to be slanderous , he was unable to afford the legal fees to sue them . As a result , John Bull continued its attack , with its stories being repeated in newspapers throughout Europe and in North America . The Fascist government of Benito Mussolini learned of Crowley 's activities and in April 1923 he was given a deportation notice forcing him to leave Italy ; without him , the Abbey closed .

 Crowley and Hirsig went to Tunis , where , dogged by continuing poor health , he unsuccessfully tried again to give up heroin , and began writing what he termed his " <unk> " , The Confessions of Aleister Crowley . They were joined in Tunis by the Thelemite Norman Mudd , who became Crowley 's public relations consultant . Employing a local boy , Mohammad ben Brahim , as his servant , Crowley went with him on a retreat to Nefta , where they performed sex magic together . In January 1924 , Crowley travelled to Nice , France , where he met with Frank Harris , underwent a series of nasal operations , and visited the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man , and had a positive opinion of its founder , George Gurdjieff . Destitute , he took on a wealthy student , Alexander Zu <unk> , before taking on another American follower , Dorothy Olsen . Crowley took Olsen back to Tunisia for a magical retreat in Nefta , where he also wrote To Man ( 1924 ) , a declaration of his own status as a prophet entrusted with bringing Thelema to humanity . After spending the winter in Paris , in early 1925 Crowley and Olsen returned to Tunis , where he wrote The Heart of the Master ( 1938 ) as an account of a vision he experienced in a trance . In March Olsen became pregnant , and Hirsig was called to take care of her ; she miscarried , following which Crowley took Olsen back to France . Hirsig later distanced herself from Crowley , who then denounced her . 
 According to Crowley , Reuss had named him head of the O.T.O. upon his death , but this was challenged by a leader of the German O.T.O. , Heinrich Tränker . Tränker called the <unk> Conference in Thuringia , Germany , which Crowley attended . There , prominent members like Karl Germer and Martha <unk> championed Crowley 's leadership , but other key figures like Albin Grau , Oskar <unk> , and Henri <unk> backed Tränker by opposing it , resulting in a split in the O.T.O. Moving to Paris , where he broke with Olsen in 1926 , Crowley went through a large number of lovers over the following years , with whom he experimented in sex magic . Throughout , he was dogged by poor health , largely caused by his heroin and cocaine addictions . In 1928 , Crowley was introduced to young Englishman Israel Regardie , who embraced Thelema and became Crowley 's secretary for the next three years . That year , Crowley also met Gerald Yorke , who began organising Crowley 's finances but never became a Thelemite . He also befriended Thomas Driberg ; Driberg did not accept Thelema either . It was here that Crowley also published one of his most significant works , Magick in Theory and Practice , which received little attention at the time . 
 In December 1929 Crowley met the Nicaraguan Maria Teresa Sanchez . Crowley was deported from France by the authorities , who disliked his reputation and feared that he was a German agent . So that she could join him in Britain , Crowley married Sanchez in August 1929 . Now based in London , Mandrake Press agreed to publish his autobiography in a limited edition six @-@ volume set , also publishing his novel Moonchild and book of short stories The Stratagem . Mandrake went into liquidation in November 1930 , before the entirety of Crowley 's Confessions could be published . Mandrake 's owner P.R. Stephenson meanwhile wrote The Legend of Aleister Crowley , an analysis of the media coverage surrounding him .
