 Blur 's baggy @-@ inspired debut album Leisure ( 1991 ) was a UK Top 10 @-@ charting record that , according to the NME , made the band the " acceptable pretty face of a whole clump of bands that have emerged since the whole Manchester thing started to run out of steam " . However , as the baggy scene soon began to fade , Blur were — according to The Guardian — " [ s ] <unk> exposed as bogus trend @-@ hoppers , [ and ] they duly caught the wrath of the Madchester backlash " . Further , following their fall from public favour , the group found that they were £ 60 @,@ 000 in debt , mainly due to mismanagement . Blur hired new manager Chris Morrison and , to recoup losses , were sent by their record label Food to the United States as part of the Rollercoaster tour . To coincide with the start of the tour , Blur released the " Popscene " single ; the new release showcased a significant change in musical direction , as Blur traded their shoegaze @-@ derived sound for one influenced by 60s British guitar pop . However , the single failed to break into the UK top 30 which further diminished Blur 's profile in the UK . 
 The 44 @-@ date tour of the United States left Blur in " complete disarray " , according to writer David Cavanagh . Dismayed by American audiences ' infatuation with grunge and the lacklustre response to their music , the group frequently drank , and members often broke into fist @-@ fights with one another . Homesick , the tour " instilled in the band a contempt for everything American " , Cavanagh later wrote ; frontman Damon Albarn , who " started to miss really simple things [ about England ] " , listened to a tape of the English pop group the Kinks throughout the tour . Upon their return to England , the group discovered that the attention of the music press had shifted to Suede . The newcomers ' success displeased Blur who , in Cavanagh 's words , " were inclined to feel that every record Suede sold was an affront to human decency " . After many poor live shows , which Blur members often performed while drunk — in particular one at a 1992 gig that featured a well @-@ received performance by Suede on the same bill — Blur were in danger of being dropped by Food .

 " Suede and America fuelled my desire to prove to everyone that Blur were worth it " , Albarn told Mojo in 2000 , " There was nothing more important in my life . " Albarn felt the popularity American grunge music was enjoying in Britain at the time would soon run out of steam , and argued that Blur would embody a renaissance of classic British pop on their next album . Although the singer felt Blur had finally found their musical identity , not everybody was convinced with Albarn 's new British @-@ centric manifesto . Food Records owner David Balfe , in particular , strongly disagreed , and got into fierce arguments with Albarn over the proposed change in Blur 's image . After the still @-@ sceptical Balfe finally relented , Food warily gave Blur the go @-@ ahead to work on their second album with Albarn 's first choice of producer , Andy Partridge of XTC . Blur and Partridge began work at The Church , a studio in Crouch End owned by keyboardist Dave Stewart . However , the pairing didn 't work out . Bassist Alex James described the sessions as a " disaster " ; he added that " as it was all being put together , they were all good parts , but it just wasn 't ... sexy " . The band successfully recorded four songs , but they were wary about working in the same conditions again . 
 Blur resumed work on their second album due to a chance meeting with producer Stephen Street , who had previously worked with the band on their 1991 single " There 's No Other Way " . With Street now producing the album , Blur recorded a mix of material spanning both the period immediately after the release of Leisure and their 1992 tour . While the band members were pleased with the recording session results , Balfe , after hearing the songs , told the band they were committing artistic suicide . Although dejected by his response , Blur gave Food the completed album in December 1992 . However , the label told the group that the album was unfit for release and at the very least they should add a few more potential singles . Albarn complied , and on Christmas Day wrote the song " For Tomorrow " . Although " For Tomorrow " sated Food 's concerns , Blur 's American label SBK voiced discontent upon hearing the finished tapes of the album . To appease SBK the band recorded " Chemical World " , which Blur thought would increase Rubbish 's American appeal . However , Blur flatly refused SBK 's demand of re @-@ recording the album with American producer Butch Vig , who was popular at the time for his work with Nirvana . 
 = = Music and lyrical themes = = 
 Modern Life Is Rubbish 's sound is highly influenced by the traditional guitar pop of British bands such as the Kinks , the Jam , the Small Faces and the Who . The album 's songs explore a number of styles — punk rock ( " Advert " ) , neo @-@ psychedelia ( " Chemical World " ) , and vaudeville music @-@ hall ( " Sunday Sunday " ) . Opening track " For Tomorrow " is , according to NME , " quintessential Blur . Damon , perennially bored , never stops singing , and Graham [ Coxon ] <unk> [ s ] his usual immaculate guitar accompaniment " . While " Oily Water " harked back to the baggy sound of Leisure , NME described " Intermission " as " a pub piano knees @-@ up that <unk> @-@ dinks along then gets frazzled in guitars and speeded @-@ up drums " . Most of the songs on the album are melodic and lushly produced , often supplemented by a brass section , string arrangements and backing vocals . To offer contrast to the classicist songwriting , Allmusic noted that " Coxon 's guitar tears each song open , either with unpredictable melodic lines or layers of translucent , hypnotic effects , and his work creates great tension with Alex James ' kinetic bass " . 
 Deriving from " the biting humor of Ray Davies and the bitterness of Paul Weller " , Albarn 's lyrics on Modern Life Is Rubbish are a social commentary and satire on contemporary suburban English life . While Rubbish celebrates modern British life , it also takes a cynical look at middle @-@ class existence . The overt Anglo @-@ <unk> of the album was also retaliation against American popular culture ; James later explained , " it was f * * * ing scary how American everything 's becoming ... so the whole thing was a f * * * ing big two fingers up to America " . NME summarised the theme of the " thinly @-@ veiled concept album " as a " London odyssey crammed full of strange commuters , peeping Thomases and lost dreams ; of opening the windows and breathing in petrol ... It 's the Village Green Preservation Society come home to find a car park in its place " . 
 = = Packaging = = 
 The album 's title derives from stenciled graffiti painted along Bayswater Road in London , created by an anarchist group . For Albarn , the phrase reflected the " rubbish " of the past that accumulated over time , stifling creativity . Albarn told journalist John Harris in 1993 that he thought the phrase was " the most significant comment on popular culture since ' Anarchy in the UK ' " . Due to Blur 's disdain for America at the time , the album 's working title was Britain Versus America . 
 The painting of the steam locomotive Mallard on the album cover was a stock image that Stylorouge — Blur 's design consultants — obtained from a photo library in Halifax . According to Design Week magazine , the painting " evoked the feel of a Just William schoolboy 's pre @-@ war Britain " . Inside the packaging , there is an oil @-@ on @-@ canvas of the band dressed as mop @-@ top skinheads in a tube train . The album 's lyric sheets also feature the songs ' chord progressions , hand @-@ written by guitar player Graham Coxon . While Albarn explained that it was an attempt to " [ let ] people to know that , old @-@ fashioned as it might seem , we write songs " , Total Guitar magazine attributed the inclusion of the chords to Coxon 's " keen [ ness ] to demystify guitar playing " . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 To promote Modern Life Is Rubbish , Food released " For Tomorrow " as the album 's lead single in the UK in April 1993 . The single , which showcased Blur 's new sound and attitude , performed moderately well in the charts , reaching number 28 . A few weeks later in May 1993 , Modern Life was released . The announcement of the album 's release included a press photo that featured the phrase " British Image 1 " <unk> behind Blur members ( who were dressed in a mixture of mod and skinhead attire ) and a Mastiff . At the time , such imagery was viewed as nationalistic and racially insensitive by the British music press ; to quiet concerns , Blur subsequently released the " British Image 2 " photo , which was " a camp <unk> of a pre @-@ war aristocratic tea party " . The album peaked at number 15 on the UK Album Chart . In the next few months Food further issued two UK Top 30 @-@ charting singles — " Chemical World " and " Sunday Sunday " — to support the record ; however , Modern Life only managed to sell around 40 @,@ 000 copies at the time . Nonetheless , the mood within the Blur camp was positive , as the band felt they had accomplished something ; bassist Alex James told writer David Cavanagh in 2000 , " Modern Life Is Rubbish was a successful record because it achieved what we set out to achieve . I thought everything was shit except us " . 
 Modern Life Is Rubbish was released in the United States by Blur 's American record label SBK in December 1993 — seven months after the album 's UK release . This delay was because SBK 's alternative @-@ music department had closed down ; Blur manager Chris Morrison later quipped , " When I asked [ SBK ] why , they said it was because the girl had left . " Despite fears that Modern Life 's overt Englishness would be lost on the American market , SBK insisted on marketing the album to MOR stations and aimed for Top 40 airplay . The label largely ignored Morrison 's arguments that Blur 's best chance of exposure in America would be to court college radio @-@ stations . SBK 's strategy was to list the album at a developing @-@ artist price ( around three dollars less than standard ) , send the band on an intensive tour in 1994 and to target modern rock airplay with debut single " Chemical World " . The record company believed this would help expand on the base audience who bought Leisure , and eventually open Blur to Top 40 radio . Further , to lessen the <unk> feel of the record , SBK added additional songs to the track @-@ listing — including " Popscene " . The plan fared rather poorly , as Modern Life barely had any impact in the US ; the album didn 't chart on the US Billboard 200 and sold only 19 @,@ 000 copies , a sharp decline compared to the 87 @,@ 000 units that Leisure shifted . 
 Modern Life Is Rubbish was well received by the British music press . NME reviewer Paul Moody was mostly enthusiastic about the record and rated it seven out of ten . While he felt the album had " enough faults to give a surveyor nightmares " , he was impressed that , unlike their peers , " Blur [ had ] thrown on their old clothes and stormed into No Man 's Land with all guns blazing " . Moody also praised the improvement in Albarn 's lyrics , which had hitherto " [ made ] Eurovision Song Contest entries seem like great works of poetry " . Q 's David Roberts , in a favourable four ( out of five ) star review , called Modern Life " an energised , infectious romp around contemporary little England , by way of an exuberant trawl through a highly @-@ coloured patchwork of its pop past " . Roberts placed Coxon as the leading contender for " the vacant crown of [ Smiths guitarist ] Johnny Marr " . American publications also spoke favourably of Modern Life . Writing for the Chicago Tribune , rock critic Greg Kot felt the album was a vast improvement over Leisure , which he found " highly derivative " of the Madchester genre . " Nothing on [ Leisure ] prepares the listener for the adventurousness of ' Modern Life is Rubbish , ' " he wrote , going on to describe the album as " a swirling , intoxicating song cycle that enriches superior <unk> with <unk> studio experiments . " St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch writer Paul Hampel commended Blur for having " taken a bold step [ with Modern Life ] – backward " , and pointed to their attempt at " a communion with past masters of smart , satirical Brit pop " . He concluded his positive review of the album by calling it a " series of pleasant surprises [ that ] offers numerous signs that great things are to come from Blur " . 
 = = Aftermath and legacy = = 
 In August 1993 , Blur set off on the <unk> Tea tour of the UK to promote Modern Life Is Rubbish . Named after a lyric in " Chemical World " , the tour was a success , as Blur reclaimed some of their popularity . A key performance was at that year 's Reading Festival which , according to David Cavanagh , was " brilliant " . On the tour , Blur performed a number of songs that would end up on the group 's follow @-@ up album , Parklife ( 1994 ) . 
 Parklife saw Blur expanding upon the themes and sounds they had first explored on Modern Life Is Rubbish ; the NME described it as " ' Modern Life Is Rubbish 's ' older brother – bigger , bolder , <unk> and funnier " . Parklife debuted at number one on the UK charts , and helped Blur emerge as one of Britain 's most popular acts . As Jim Shelley wrote in The Guardian , " a year after Blur were dismissed as too mannered , too retrograde and too English , Parklife was embraced for exactly the same reasons " . Modern Life Is Rubbish and Parklife , along with The Great Escape ( 1995 ) , formed what would be later referred to as the " Life " trilogy of Blur albums revolving around British themes . 
 Modern Life Is Rubbish remains highly regarded by critics , and is seen as one of the early , defining releases of Britpop , a genre that would dominate British pop music in the mid @-@ 1990s . Writing for The Guardian , John Harris called the album " one of the 1990s ' most influential records " . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic felt that " Modern Life Is Rubbish established Blur as the heir to the archly British pop of the Kinks , the Small Faces , and the Jam " and that it " ushered in a new era of British pop " . Mark Redfern wrote in Under the Radar magazine that following Modern Life Is Rubbish , " [ a ] whole wave of Britpop bands followed in [ Blur 's ] footsteps , and for a while , it was cool to be British again " .

 The American release of Modern Life Is Rubbish features an altered track listing . Blur 's American label SBK Records preferred the group 's original demo of " Chemical World " , and included it on the album instead of the Stephen Street @-@ produced version . According to Select magazine , this " defeated the object of recording a heavy rock song in the first place " . SBK inserted " Popscene " in between " Turn It Up " and " Resigned " ; Blur had refused to include " Popscene " on the British version of Modern Life , disappointed by the public reaction to the song when it was released as a single . " We thought , If you didn ’ t fucking want it in the first place , " Graham Coxon explained to Select , " you ’ re not going to get it now " . The American version also features several tracks with a few seconds of silence ( tracks 18 to 67 on the CD ) , followed by two " For Tomorrow " B @-@ sides ( " When the Cows Come Home " and " Peach " ) as hidden tracks 68 and 69 .

 = Hemorrhoid = 
 Hemorrhoids , also spelled haemorrhoids , are vascular structures in the anal canal . In their normal state , they are cushions that help with stool control . They become a disease when swollen or inflamed ; the unqualified term " hemorrhoid " is often used to mean the disease . The signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids depend on the type present . Internal hemorrhoids usually present with painless , bright red rectal bleeding when defecating . External hemorrhoids often result in pain and swelling in the area of the anus . If bleeding occurs it is usually darker . Symptoms frequently get better after a few days . A skin tag may remain after the healing of an external hemorrhoid . 
 While the exact cause of hemorrhoids remains unknown , a number of factors which increase pressure in the abdomen are believed to be involved . This may include constipation , diarrhea , and sitting on the toilet for a long time . Hemorrhoids are also more common during pregnancy . Diagnosis is made by looking at the area . Many people incorrectly refer to any symptom occurring around the anal area as " hemorrhoids " and serious causes of the symptoms should be ruled out . <unk> or <unk> is reasonable to confirm the diagnosis and rule out more serious causes . 
 No specific treatment is often needed . Initial measures consists of increasing fiber intake , drinking fluids to maintain hydration , NSAIDs to help with pain , and rest . <unk> creams applied to the area are poorly supported by evidence . A number of minor procedures may be performed if symptoms are severe or do not improve with conservative management . Surgery is reserved for those who fail to improve following these measures . 
 Half to two thirds of people have problems with hemorrhoids at some point in their lives . Males and females are affected about equally commonly . Hemorrhoids affect people most often between 45 and 65 years of age . It is more common among the wealthy . Outcomes are usually good . The first known mention of the disease is from a 1700 BC Egyptian papyrus . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 In about 40 % of people with pathological hemorrhoids there are no significant symptoms . Internal and external hemorrhoids may present differently ; however , many people may have a combination of the two . Bleeding enough to cause anemia is rare , and life @-@ threatening bleeding is even more uncommon . Many people feel embarrassed when facing the problem and often seek medical care only when the case is advanced . 
 = = = External = = = 
 If not thrombosed , external hemorrhoids may cause few problems . However , when thrombosed , hemorrhoids may be very painful . Nevertheless , this pain typically resolves in two to three days . The swelling may , however , take a few weeks to disappear . A skin tag may remain after healing . If hemorrhoids are large and cause issues with hygiene , they may produce irritation of the surrounding skin , and thus itchiness around the anus . 
 = = = Internal = = = 
 Internal hemorrhoids usually present with painless , bright red rectal bleeding during or following a bowel movement . The blood typically covers the stool ( a condition known as <unk> ) , is on the toilet paper , or drips into the toilet bowl . The stool itself is usually normally coloured . Other symptoms may include mucous discharge , a perianal mass if they prolapse through the anus , itchiness , and fecal incontinence . Internal hemorrhoids are usually only painful if they become thrombosed or necrotic . 
 = = Causes = = 
 The exact cause of symptomatic hemorrhoids is unknown . A number of factors are believed to play a role , including irregular bowel habits ( constipation or diarrhea ) , lack of exercise , nutritional factors ( low @-@ fiber diets ) , increased intra @-@ abdominal pressure ( prolonged straining , ascites , an intra @-@ abdominal mass , or pregnancy ) , genetics , an absence of valves within the hemorrhoidal veins , and aging . Other factors believed to increase risk include obesity , prolonged sitting , a chronic cough , and pelvic floor dysfunction . Evidence for these associations , however , is poor . 
 During pregnancy , pressure from the fetus on the abdomen and hormonal changes cause the hemorrhoidal vessels to enlarge . The birth of the baby also leads to increased intra @-@ abdominal pressures . Pregnant women rarely need surgical treatment , as symptoms usually resolve after delivery . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 Hemorrhoid cushions are a part of normal human anatomy and become a pathological disease only when they experience abnormal changes . There are three main cushions present in the normal anal canal . These are located classically at left lateral , right anterior , and right posterior positions . They are composed of neither arteries nor veins , but blood vessels called <unk> , connective tissue , and smooth muscle . <unk> do not have muscle tissue in their walls , as veins do . This set of blood vessels is known as the hemorrhoidal plexus . 
 Hemorrhoid cushions are important for continence . They contribute to 15 – 20 % of anal closure pressure at rest and protect the internal and external anal sphincter muscles during the passage of stool . When a person bears down , the intra @-@ abdominal pressure grows , and hemorrhoid cushions increase in size helping to maintain anal closure . Hemorrhoid symptoms are believed to result when these vascular structures slide downwards or when venous pressure is excessively increased . Increased internal and external anal sphincter pressure may also be involved in hemorrhoid symptoms . Two types of hemorrhoids occur : internals from the superior hemorrhoidal plexus and externals from the inferior hemorrhoidal plexus . The dentate line divides the two regions . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Hemorrhoids are typically diagnosed by physical examination . A visual examination of the anus and surrounding area may diagnose external or prolapsed hemorrhoids . A rectal exam may be performed to detect possible rectal tumors , polyps , an enlarged prostate , or abscesses . This examination may not be possible without appropriate sedation because of pain , although most internal hemorrhoids are not associated with pain . Visual confirmation of internal hemorrhoids may require <unk> , insertion of a hollow tube device with a light attached at one end . The two types of hemorrhoids are external and internal . These are differentiated by their position with respect to the dentate line . Some persons may concurrently have symptomatic versions of both . If pain is present , the condition is more likely to be an anal fissure or an external hemorrhoid rather than an internal hemorrhoid . 
 = = = Internal = = = 
 Internal hemorrhoids originate above the dentate line . They are covered by columnar epithelium , which lacks pain receptors . They were classified in 1985 into four grades based on the degree of prolapse : 
 Grade I : No prolapse , just prominent blood vessels 
 Grade II : Prolapse upon bearing down , but spontaneous reduction 
 Grade III : Prolapse upon bearing down requiring manual reduction 
 Grade IV : Prolapse with inability to be manually reduced . 
 = = = External = = = 
 External hemorrhoids occur below the dentate or pectinate line . They are covered proximally by <unk> and distally by skin , both of which are sensitive to pain and temperature . 
 = = = Differential = = = 
 Many <unk> problems , including fissures , fistulae , abscesses , colorectal cancer , rectal varices , and itching have similar symptoms and may be incorrectly referred to as hemorrhoids . <unk> bleeding may also occur owing to colorectal cancer , colitis including inflammatory bowel disease , <unk> disease , and <unk> . If anemia is present , other potential causes should be considered . 
 Other conditions that produce an anal mass include skin tags , anal warts , rectal prolapse , polyps , and enlarged anal papillae . <unk> varices due to increased portal hypertension ( blood pressure in the portal venous system ) may present similar to hemorrhoids but are a different condition . Portal hypertension does not increase the risk of hemorrhoids . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 A number of preventative measures are recommended , including avoiding straining while attempting to defecate , avoiding constipation and diarrhea either by eating a high @-@ fiber diet and drinking plenty of fluid or by taking fiber supplements , and getting sufficient exercise . Spending less time attempting to defecate , avoiding reading while on the toilet , and losing weight for overweight persons and avoiding heavy lifting are also recommended . 
 = = Management = = 
 = = = Conservative = = = 
 Conservative treatment typically consists of foods rich in dietary fiber , intake of oral fluids to maintain hydration , nonsteroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs , sitz baths , and rest . Increased fiber intake has been shown to improve outcomes and may be achieved by dietary alterations or the consumption of fiber supplements . Evidence for benefits from sitz baths during any point in treatment , however , is lacking . If they are used , they should be limited to 15 minutes at a time . 
 While many topical agents and suppositories are available for the treatment of hemorrhoids , little evidence supports their use . Steroid @-@ containing agents should not be used for more than 14 days , as they may cause thinning of the skin . Most agents include a combination of active ingredients . These may include a barrier cream such as petroleum jelly or zinc oxide , an analgesic agent such as lidocaine , and a <unk> such as epinephrine . Some contain Balsam of Peru to which certain people may be allergic . 
 <unk> are of questionable benefit , with potential side effects . Symptoms usually resolve following pregnancy ; thus active treatment is often delayed until after delivery . 
 = = = Procedures = = = 
 A number of office @-@ based procedures may be performed . While generally safe , rare serious side effects such as perianal sepsis may occur . 
 Rubber band ligation is typically recommended as the first @-@ line treatment in those with grade 1 to 3 disease . It is a procedure in which elastic bands are applied onto an internal hemorrhoid at least 1 cm above the dentate line to cut off its blood supply . Within 5 – 7 days , the withered hemorrhoid falls off . If the band is placed too close to the dentate line , intense pain results immediately afterwards . Cure rate has been found to be about 87 % with a complication rate of up to 3 % . 
 <unk> involves the injection of a sclerosing agent , such as phenol , into the hemorrhoid . This causes the vein walls to collapse and the hemorrhoids to shrivel up . The success rate four years after treatment is about 70 % . 
 A number of cauterization methods have been shown to be effective for hemorrhoids , but are usually only used when other methods fail . This procedure can be done using <unk> , infrared radiation , laser surgery , or <unk> . Infrared cauterization may be an option for grade 1 or 2 disease . In those with grade 3 or 4 disease , <unk> rates are high . 
 = = = Surgery = = = 
 A number of surgical techniques may be used if conservative management and simple procedures fail . All surgical treatments are associated with some degree of complications including bleeding , infection , anal strictures and urinary retention , due to the close proximity of the rectum to the nerves that supply the bladder . Also , a small risk of fecal incontinence occurs , particularly of liquid , with rates reported between 0 % and 28 % . <unk> ectropion is another condition which may occur after hemorrhoidectomy ( often together with anal stenosis ) . This is where the anal mucosa becomes everted from the anus , similar to a very mild form of rectal prolapse . 
 <unk> hemorrhoidectomy is a surgical excision of the hemorrhoid used primarily only in severe cases . It is associated with significant postoperative pain and usually requires 2 – 4 weeks for recovery . However , the long @-@ term benefit is greater in those with grade 3 hemorrhoids as compared to rubber band ligation . It is the recommended treatment in those with a thrombosed external hemorrhoid if carried out within 24 – 72 hours . <unk> <unk> ointment after the procedure helps both with pain and healing . 
 Doppler @-@ guided , <unk> hemorrhoidal <unk> is a minimally invasive treatment using an ultrasound doppler to accurately locate the arterial blood inflow . These arteries are then " tied off " and the prolapsed tissue is sutured back to its normal position . It has a slightly higher recurrence rate , but fewer complications compared to a hemorrhoidectomy . 
 <unk> hemorrhoidectomy , also known as stapled <unk> , involves the removal of much of the abnormally enlarged hemorrhoidal tissue , followed by a repositioning of the remaining hemorrhoidal tissue back to its normal anatomical position . It is generally less painful and is associated with faster healing compared to complete removal of hemorrhoids . However , the chance of symptomatic hemorrhoids returning is greater than for conventional <unk> , so it is typically only recommended for grade 2 or 3 disease . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 It is difficult to determine how common hemorrhoids are as many people with the condition do not see a healthcare provider . However , symptomatic hemorrhoids are thought to affect at least 50 % of the US population at some time during their lives , and around 5 % of the population is affected at any given time . Both sexes experience about the same incidence of the condition , with rates peaking between 45 and 65 years . They are more common in Caucasians and those of higher socioeconomic status . 
 Long @-@ term outcomes are generally good , though some people may have recurrent symptomatic episodes . Only a small proportion of persons end up needing surgery . 
 = = History = = 
 The first known mention of this disease is from a 1700 BC Egyptian papyrus , which advises : “ ... Thou <unk> give a recipe , an ointment of great protection ; acacia leaves , ground , <unk> and cooked together . Smear a strip of fine linen there @-@ with and place in the anus , that he recovers immediately . " In 460 BC , the Hippocratic corpus discusses a treatment similar to modern rubber band ligation : “ And hemorrhoids in like manner you may treat by transfixing them with a needle and tying them with very thick and woolen thread , for application , and do not <unk> until they drop off , and always leave one behind ; and when the patient recovers , let him be put on a course of <unk> . ” Hemorrhoids may have been described in the Bible , with earlier English translations using the now @-@ obsolete spelling " <unk> " . 
 Celsus ( 25 BC – AD 14 ) described ligation and excision procedures , and discussed the possible complications . Galen advocated severing the connection of the arteries to veins , claiming it reduced both pain and the spread of gangrene . The <unk> Samhita ( fourth – fifth century AD ) is similar to the words of Hippocrates , but emphasizes wound cleanliness . In the 13th century , European surgeons such as Lanfranc of Milan , Guy de <unk> , Henri de <unk> , and John of <unk> made great progress and development of the surgical techniques . 
 In medieval times , hemorrhoids were also known as Saint <unk> 's curse after a sixth @-@ century saint who developed them following tilling the soil . The first use of the word " hemorrhoid " in English occurs in 1398 , derived from the Old French " <unk> " , from Latin <unk> , in turn from the Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) , " liable to discharge blood " , from <unk> ( haima ) , " blood " and <unk> ( <unk> ) , " stream , flow , current " , itself from <unk> ( <unk> ) , " to flow , to stream " .

Conservative political commentator Glenn Beck underwent surgery for hemorrhoids , subsequently describing his unpleasant experience in a widely viewed 2008 YouTube video . Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter had surgery for hemorrhoids in 1984 . Cricketers Matthew Hayden and Viv Richards also had the condition .

Cambridge , with some notable international players on the team , were the clear favourites on the day . After they won the toss and elected to kick off with the wind behind them , the majority of the first 40 minutes was played in Oxford 's half , much of it in their 25 . Yet Cambridge failed to break through Oxford 's defence , chiefly that of the centres Vassall and Tarr . Just before half time , with a scrum deep in Oxford 's half , Rupert Williamson fed George Cunningham . The ball came to Tarr , who drew his opposite man , K. G. Macleod , and timed his pass to Vassall so that he , in turn , drew the Cambridge left wing near the half @-@ way line and put H. Martin to run in a try from there . Oxford went on to win 16 – 0 . 
 With Oxford having won the Varsity Match in 1906 and again in 1907 , Harold Hodges , the Oxford captain , was inclined to keep the winning three @-@ quarter line for 1908 , including the centre combination of Vassall and Tarr . One of that year 's freshers was Tennant Sloan , a capped Scottish centre , who chose to try out for full @-@ back , realising that he was unlikely to be picked ahead of either of the incumbent centres . Vassall and Tarr had excellent ball handling skills , were quick around the field and fine decision makers ; Tarr was also a formidable tackler . Ronnie Poulton played several games for Oxford ahead of the Varsity Match but it was clear that Hodges preferred the Vassall @-@ Tarr pairing and Poulton only played when Vassall was injured , as he did in the 20 – 0 defeat of Richmond RFC . On 12 December , the 1908 Varsity Match resulted in a hard fought 5 – 5 draw , the Cambridge pack having improved considerably since the previous year . As it turned out , Vassall 's persistent ankle injury rendered him useless just five minutes into the game . The Times noted Tarr 's performance saying : " FN Tarr , at left centre three @-@ quarter , gave a magnificent display of defensive play . " 
 Tarr earned his first England cap on 9 January 1909 against the touring Australians at Rectory Field , Blackheath . His opportunity came up with both Vassall and John Birkett injured . Also earning their first caps that day were Edgar Mobbs on the right wing and Alex Ashcroft , of Cambridge University , at fly @-@ half . England took an early lead , when Tarr put Mobbs in for a try in the opening stages . That try has been described by his contemporary , rugby journalist and author E. H. D. Sewell , as being " one of the very best ever scored , being perfect in execution from the moment Tarr first received the ball to the moment Mobbs touched it down for a try . " However , Australia took control of the game to win 9 – 3 . 
 Tarr was selected to play Wales the following week in Cardiff . Although England played better than expected , Wales were favourites to win and beat the visitors 8 – 0 . Two weeks later , on 30 January , England played France with a half @-@ back combination of Frank Hutchinson , earning his first cap , and Williamson ; Poulton making his debut at centre alongside Tarr ; and Mobbs and Tom Simpson on the wings . France was not yet part of what was to become the Five Nations tournament ( now the Six Nations ) and was a relatively easy side to play . England won the game comfortably 22 – 0 , with Tarr scoring two tries , one through good interplay with Mobbs and the other , a fine individual run . Despite the tries , Tarr was dropped from the England squad . 
 For the 1909 Varsity Match , Cunningham announced his choice of Poulton at a meeting on 2 December which Vassall was unable to attend . Cunningham sent him a letter by hand informing him of the decision . When the note returned undelivered , Cunningham hesitated , at which point Tarr offered to give up his own place for Poulton but Cunningham stuck to his initial selection . The game was played on 11 December , with Oxford at the start having the worse of it until one moment turned the game around : after the Oxford forwards got the ball back , <unk> , at scrum @-@ half , sent the ball to Cunningham , who passed on to Tarr and he to his fellow centre Colin <unk> . He fed the ball to Poulton on the left wing still inside the Oxford half . Poulton then broke through the defence to score under the posts . With Oxford eight points ahead at the end of the first quarter , Tarr was forced off the field after breaking his collarbone making a tackle , and missed much of what was described by referee F.C. Potter @-@ Irwin as " the fastest and most spectacular Varsity Match he had ever witnessed " . Oxford beat Cambridge 23 – 3 , Poulton scoring five tries . 
 After graduating a Bachelor of Arts , Tarr was articled to the solicitors firm of Owston , Dickinson , Simpson , and Bigg in Leicester , and also joined the Leicester Tigers , then as now considered one of the strongest clubs in the country . He scored 72 points in 94 appearances . In 1913 , having been dropped by England four years earlier , he was surprised to be called up again to play Scotland on 15 March at Twickenham . Tarr was not at his best and it was to be his last international appearance . England , meanwhile , only managed a 3 – 0 victory , but it was enough to regain the Calcutta Cup and earn its first Grand Slam . 
 Although Tarr spent the majority of his rugby career with Oxford and Leicester , he is recorded as representing club teams <unk> and Richmond F.C. and also Midland Counties .

 While at Oxford , Tarr had served in the Officers ' Training Corps , reaching the rank of cadet sergeant . In 1911 , he joined the Territorial Force , serving with the 1 / 4th Battalion , Leicestershire Regiment , as a second lieutenant . In 1913 , he was promoted to lieutenant and when war was declared the following year , Tarr enlisted almost immediately , becoming the regiment machine @-@ gun officer . His battalion was deployed to the Western Front with the 46th ( North Midland ) Division and landed at le Havre , France , on 3 March 1915 . Following the Second Battle of Ypres , the battalion 's dugouts were located between Lake Zillebeke and the Ypres – Comines railway line south @-@ east of Ypres , Belgium . On the afternoon of 18 July 1915 , Tarr , who was the acting adjutant of his battalion and whose name had been put forward for promotion to captain , had gone to the dugouts of the 5th Battalion , Lincolnshire Regiment , towards Zillebeke , to liaise with the adjutant . While the Germans were shelling the position , Tarr put his head out to tell some men to remain under cover when a splinter from a shell struck him in the face , killing him . If it had struck any other part of his body , he would have survived . 
 Tarr was buried in the Railway <unk> Burial Ground that night , not far from where he was killed . Captain John Milne , in Footprints of the 1 / 4th Leicestershire Regiment , described Tarr as 
 " ... the most attractive personality in the battalion , young , good @-@ looking , full of charm , with an eye that always had a twinkle in it , a born leader , yet the kindest person possible , a <unk> international , the idol of the machine @-@ gun section , which he commanded before he became adjutant . Everybody was heartbroken , for everybody would miss him they would not look upon his like again .... " 
 Tarr was one of 27 England rugby players killed in the First World War . There are memorials to him on the family headstone in Welford Road Cemetery , at Uppingham School , University College , Oxford , the Oxford University rugby club and the Richmond Athletic Ground . 
 = Miscellaneous solo piano compositions ( Rachmaninoff ) = 
 The composer Sergei Rachmaninoff produced a number of solo piano pieces that were either lost , unpublished , or not assigned an opus number . While often disregarded in the concert repertoire , they are nevertheless part of his oeuvre . He composed sixteen such pieces , and all others are lost . Ten of these pieces were composed before he completed his Piano Concerto No. 1 , his first opus , and the rest interspersed throughout his later life . In these casual works , he draws upon the influence of other composers , including Frédéric Chopin and Pyotr Tchaikovsky . The more substantial works , the Three Nocturnes and Four Pieces , are sets of well @-@ thought out pieces that are his first attempts at cohesive structure among multiple pieces . Oriental Sketch and Prelude in D minor , two pieces he composed very late in his life , are short works that exemplify his style as a mature composer . Whether completed as a child or adult , these pieces cover a wide spectrum of forms while maintaining his characteristic Russian style . 
 = = Works = = 
 In the autumn of 1885 , the twelve @-@ year @-@ old Rachmaninoff entered the home of Nikolai Zverev to receive private piano instruction and at the end of May 1886 , Zverev took his students to Crimea , where Rachmaninoff continued his studies , hoping to gain entrance to Anton Arensky 's harmony class at the Moscow Conservatory . It was during this time that Rachmaninoff created his first composition , a two @-@ page Étude in F @-@ sharp major ( the manuscript is now lost ) . After admission to the class , he produced more exercises , the earliest of which is a Lento in D minor ; it is the only surviving piece of ten he is said to have composed . 
 Now beginning to compose independently , Rachmaninoff 's next project was a group he titled Three Nocturnes , and is regarded as his first serious attempt at writing for the piano . The first nocturne , in F @-@ sharp minor , was written 14 @-@ 21 November 1887 , and has three parts : a beginning and an end in andante cantabile and a central section in allegro . The slower <unk> are gentle sections , influenced by Pyotr Tchaikovsky , while the allegro is unnatural and stiff and unusually fast for a nocturne . The second piece , in F major , followed on 22 @-@ 25 November , also contains a slower portion coupled with a quick section . No. 3 , in C minor , took more than a month to compose , dated from 3 December 1886 to 12 January 1887 . With a chordal texture spread over the entire keyboard , it is reminiscent of the music of Robert Schumann . The nocturnes were published posthumously in Moscow in 1949 , but were not assigned an opus number . 
 The Four Pieces of 1887 are perhaps Rachmaninoff 's first comprehensive works . Each has a clear aim and method to attain it , and all unfold with a fluency significantly more advanced than that shown in the previous nocturnes . The opening Romance , in F @-@ sharp minor , harks back to Frédéric Chopin 's tenderness . The E @-@ flat minor Prelude is an unremarkable but well @-@ thought out piece . The third , a <unk> in E major , is modestly expressive , but the Gavotte in D major is , although repetitive , the most energetic and vigorous piece . These were published posthumously in Moscow in 1948 , without an opus number . 
 In 1890 , after vacationing at <unk> , his family 's summer residence , Rachmaninoff wrote a letter to Natalia <unk> , a family friend in Moscow , reporting that he had to write a fugue for Arensky 's class , " an unpleasant circumstance however you look at it . " It turned out to resemble a canon more than a fugue , however , and was published in 1949 as Canon in E minor . Although written as an assignment , the piece conveys the impression not of an academic contrapuntal exercise but rather of a vivid outburst . The texture and harmony show enough advancement over his earlier Four Pieces to indicate that he had been sensible not to publish them as his opus 1 . 
 In 1891 , Rachmaninoff composed his Piano Concerto No. 1 ( which became his first official opus ) and afterwards in July , a small piece , Prelude in F major , which he revised later to include the cello . It was at this time , in 1892 , that the Morceaux de fantaisie were composed . In 1891 Rachmaninoff also composed his Suite in D minor for orchestra , considered lost until the manuscript was found in 2002 , leading to the discovery that a previously @-@ unattributed composition for piano is a reduction for solo piano of this Suite . The suite is in four movements : Lento : Allegro moderato in D minor , Lento in B minor , Menuetto in F @-@ sharp major , and Allegro in D major . 
 He spent much of the next few years writing some of his orchestral pieces , including The Rock ( 1893 ) and Caprice <unk> ( 1895 ) . His return to pianistic work in early 1896 was marked by his contribution to Four Improvisations , a collaboration with Anton Arensky , Alexander Glazunov , and Sergei Taneyev . After the Six Moments <unk> were completed in 1896 , Rachmaninoff composed a single <unk> de Fantaisie in G minor on 11 January 1899 . He subtitled it " <unk> " , however what this means is unknown . It is two pages long and features an emphatic , if not brief , climax . He also produced a <unk> in F major in February of that year , which is also short and has clean counterpoint . He composed most of his published works in this period , starting with the Chopin Variations . 
 After the nine Études @-@ Tableaux , Op. 39 , Rachmaninoff composed several minor works in 1917 . The Oriental Sketch is a fast @-@ paced piece littered with sixteenth note figures . The piece was not intended to be associated with the Orient ; the title was given by the publisher . The Prelude in D minor , a dark piece with thick and fast moving chords that repeatedly descend into low register , is a manifestation of his unhappiness with the October Revolution . The manuscript survived and was first published in 1973 . His penultimate piano composition ( only his Corelli Variations came later ) was a one @-@ page piece entitled Fragments , a brief nostalgic piece from his final days in Moscow . It was first published in the magazine , The Etude , in 1919 . 
 In 2003 , while researching Rachmaninoff material at the Library of Congress , the Australian pianist Scott Davie discovered a two @-@ page sketch of a previously unknown Rachmaninoff piano piece in D minor . While he was able to make a pencil copy , it wasn 't until later he realized that the sketch was complete . Davie was given permission to make use of the piece by the composer 's great @-@ granddaughter , Natalie Wanamaker Javier , while attending the 2006 International Rachmaninoff Conference in Amsterdam . The piece was recorded and released by ABC Classics on his Pictures from an Exhibition CD . Since then the piece has also been recorded by Vladimir Ashkenazy and released by Decca . 
 = Han campaigns against Minyue = 
 The Han campaigns against Minyue were three Han Dynasty military campaigns dispatched against the Minyue state . The first campaign was in response to Minyue 's invasion of Eastern Ou in 138 BC . In 135 BC , a second campaign was sent to intervene in a war between Minyue and Nanyue . After the campaign , Minyue was split into Minyue , ruled by a Han proxy king , and Dongyue . Dongyue was defeated in a third military campaign in 111 BC and the former Minyue territory was annexed by the Han Dynasty . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Qin Dynasty 's military incursions in the south of what is now China began a period of expansion that continued under the next dynasty , the Han . After the fall of the Qin , Minyue was established in 202 BC , and Eastern Ou in 192 BC , with the support of the Han . They were rewarded with greater autonomy in return for their contributions to the revolt against the Qin . The local rulers of the Minyue region had also sided with Liu Bang 's Han instead of Xiang Yu 's Chu during the Chu – Han Contention , a civil war that ensued during the collapse of the Qin . 
 Minyue was created by carving out the former Qin province of <unk> , with Dongye as the capital , into a new kingdom ruled by Zou Wuzhu . A decade later , Zou Yao was granted control over Donghai , popularly referred to as Eastern Ou after the name of the kingdom 's capital . The title was bestowed with a declaration by the Han emperor that " Zou Yan , the chief of Min , achieved great merit and his people supported the Han cause " . The Han historian Sima Qian claims both rulers were descendants of <unk> , the 5th century BC ruler of Yue . The family had lost their status as rulers during the Qin 's wars of unification , when they were demoted to local chieftains . 
 = = Han – Minyue wars = = 
 = = = Initial military intervention = = = 
 In 138 BC , Minyue invaded the Eastern Ou , prompting Eastern Ou to request the intervention of Han forces . The Han court was divided over offering military support . The campaign was opposed by the Han commander @-@ in @-@ chief Tian Fen , who argued that warfare between the Yue tribes occurred frequently and the affairs of Yue were not the responsibility of the Han government . The concept of Chinese centrality among nations persuaded the court to dispatch an army . In accordance with Chinese political philosophy , the ruler or Son of Heaven held a mandate that obligated the emperor to help smaller countries in need . Otherwise , as the Han official Zhuang Zhu phrased it , " how could we treat the myriad kingdoms as our children ? " 
 A Han naval force led by Zhuang Zhu departed from Shaoxing in northern Zhejiang towards Minyue . The Minyue surrendered before the arrival of the Han troops , and withdrew from Eastern Ou . There were plans to move the residents of Eastern Ou to the area between the Huai River and Yangtze River , following a request by the king of Eastern Ou . 
 = = = Second intervention = = = 
 In 135 BC , war broke out when Minyue invaded Nanyue . Zhao Mo , the king of Nanyue , asked for and received the military assistance of the Han . In 180 BC , Zhao had offered to submit as a vassal and the Han agreed , a decision that was partly based on Zhao 's ancestral roots in northern China . An army led by the generals Wang Hui and Han Anguo was ordered to invade Minyue . The campaign was cut short by palace infighting in the Minyue court . Panicked at news of an invasion , the younger brother of the Minyue king Zou Ying , Zou Yushan , conspired with the royal court to depose Ying . Yushan killed his brother with a spear , decapitated the corpse , and sent the head to Wang . The Han forces withdrew soon after . 
 Zhao Mo was grateful for the speed of the intervention against Minyue . The Han official Zhuang Zhu was dispatched to meet with the Nanyue emperor , who expressed his gratitude . Zhao sent his son , the prince Zhao <unk> , to the Han capital at Chang 'an , where he was to work for the Emperor . In the aftermath of the campaign , Minyue had split into a dual monarchy , Minyue and Dongyue . Minyue was controlled by the Han through a proxy ruler , while Dongyue was independently ruled by Zou Yushan , the brother who deposed the former king during the invasion . 
 Zou Cou was selected to fill the role of Han proxy ruler because he was the only member of the Minyue royal family who refused to take part in the war against Nanyue . However , his efforts to exert control over the people of Minyue were not successful . The subjects of the kingdom pledged their loyalty to Zou Yushan instead . Yushan declared himself king of Minyue without the consent of the Emperor Wu , the Han ruler . The emperor was informed of Yushan 's actions , and recognized him as king of Dongyue instead of ordering a second invasion . Emperor Wu considered it a reward to Yushan for killing Zou Ying and ending the war . The assassination had prevented the Han from wasting any more resources on the conflict . Dongyue had an uneasy relationship with the Han . In 112 BC , Han officials were killed in a military engagement with Dongyue . 
 = = = Third campaign and conquest = = = 
 As Han troops returned from the Han – Nanyue War in 111 BC , the Han government debated annexing Dongyue . Dongyue , under King Zou Yushan , had agreed to assist the Han campaign against Nanyue , but the Dongyue army never reached Nanyue . Yushan blamed the delay on the weather . The proposal to annex Dongyue was suggested by General Yang Pu , but was dismissed by Emperor Wu . The naval force arrived home without having attacked Dongyue . Zou caught wind of Yang 's request , and responded by revolting against the Han . Han forces were led by General Han Yue , General Yang Pu , commander Wang Wenshu , and two marquises of Yue ancestry . The army crushed the rebellion and captured Dongyue in the last months of 111 BC , placing the former Minyue territory under Han rule . 
 Historical records report that Minyue and Dongyue were emptied of people , and that its residents were deported to the territories between the Huai River and the Yangtze River . The alleged population transfer was a resumption of a policy that had been planned since 138 BC . The Han government considered the mountainous region difficult to control and was wary of trusting its residents . Modern historians doubt the event happened . The deportation of an entire kingdom is implausible , and nothing has been found to verify a migration of Han settlers to the Minyue region around the year 1 , something that would have occurred had the area been abandoned while under Han control . There was only one town of Han settlers , Dongye , in Minyue . Dongye was built where the Min River meets the sea , around the time of Emperor Wu 's reign . It is more likely that the assimilation of Minyue into the culture of the Han empire happened later in the dynasty . 
 = = Historical significance = = 
 From one settlement in year 1 , the Han Dynasty 's involvement in the Minyue region grew into several counties . There were many Chinese counties in the area by the 4th century . The Minyue had been culturally assimilated by the time the Han Dynasty collapsed , and China was undergoing a transition to the Three Kingdoms period of Cao Wei , Shu Han , and Eastern Wu . Political upheaval in the north , such as Wang Mang 's usurpation , had caused Han migrants to resettle in the south . The Han Dynasty 's military expansion widened its commercial ties . The empire 's conquest of Minyue and Nanyue meant it now neighbored kingdoms in Southeast Asia . Trade with the Han and subsequent dynasties had an impact on Southeast Asia , where goods have been found made in styles resembling that of the Chinese . Maritime trade linked China with Rome , India , and the Middle East . 
 = Non @-@ constituency Member of Parliament = 
 A Non @-@ constituency Member of Parliament ( NCMP ) is a member of a Singaporean opposition political party who , according to the Constitution and Parliamentary Elections Act , is declared to have been elected a Member of the Parliament of Singapore despite having lost in a general election by virtue of having been one of the best performing losers . NCMPs enjoy most of the privileges of ordinary Members of Parliament . They are , however , not allowed to vote on several types of bills such as bills to amend the Constitution and motions of no confidence in the Government . An election candidate who has been offered an NCMP seat may decline to take it up . 
 The NCMP scheme was introduced in 1984 , and was a significant modification of the traditional Westminster system of government . Since the ruling People 's Action Party had won all parliamentary seats in the four general elections since independence , Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew argued that the NCMP scheme would ensure that opposition voices would be heard in Parliament . According to him , this would be beneficial to Singapore as it would give the younger generation of Singaporeans a chance to see what an opposition can or cannot do . When the first constitutional amendment was made to initiate the NCMP scheme , between three and six NCMPs were allowed in Parliament . The Constitution was amended again in 2010 to allow for a maximum of nine NCMPs in Parliament . 
 Since its inception , the scheme has been widely criticised . It has been considered undemocratic as it allows candidates who do not have the mandate of the people to air their views in Parliament . Furthermore , members of the opposition have criticized the scheme for creating an unequal playing field in a general election by enabling the ruling People 's Action Party ( PAP ) to argue that the electorate need not vote for opposition candidates as there will already be some opposition representation in Parliament . Despite this critique , several opposition politicians have accepted NCMP seats , including Lee Siew @-@ <unk> , J. B. Jeyaretnam , Steve Chia and Sylvia Lim . NCMPs have raised notable points in Parliament with regards to various public policy issues such as criminal procedure , education , health and social welfare . 
 The 2011 general election brought three NCMPs into Parliament : Lina Loh ( the wife of Chiam See Tong , the former MP for <unk> Pasir Single Member Constituency ) of the Singapore People 's Party , and Gerald Giam and Yee Jenn Jong of the Workers ' Party of Singapore . The general election of 2015 brought in three different NCMPs into Parliament : Dennis Tan , Leon Perera and Daniel Goh . A NCMP seat was offered to former MP for Punggol East , Lee Li Lian but she declined and the seat was eventually accepted by Associate Professor Daniel Goh . 
 = = Position of Non @-@ constituency Members of Parliament = = 
 A Non @-@ constituency Member of Parliament ( " NCMP " ) is a candidate of an opposition political party who , despite having lost in a general election , is declared elected as a Member of the Parliament of Singapore ( " MP " ) by virtue of provisions in the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act enabling the unsuccessful candidates who have performed the best to be accorded the status . The MP is so called because he or she does not represent any constituency ( or electoral division ) in Parliament . 
 The NCMP scheme was introduced on 22 August 1984 by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore ( Amendment ) Act 1984 and the Parliamentary Elections ( Amendment ) Act 1984 . Under Article 39 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the Constitution which was introduced by the constitutional amendment Act , the maximum number of NCMPs was set at six . However , the actual number that could be declared elected at any general election was fixed at three , less the total number of Opposition MPs elected to Parliament . The President , acting on the advice of the Cabinet , could order that between four and six NCMPs be declared elected for the purpose of a particular general election . Such an order ceased to have effect at the next dissolution of Parliament . On 1 July 2010 , the need for a presidential order to increase the number of NCMPs was removed . Instead , the maximum number of NCMPs in Parliament was increased from six to nine , and the actual number that would be declared elected following a general election would be nine less the number of opposition MPs elected to Parliament . 
 = = = Becoming an NCMP = = = 
 NCMPs have been called the " best losers " of each general election . As NCMPs are declared elected from candidates who fail to win at general elections , they are subject to the same qualifying criteria as elected MPs : 
 They must be Singapore citizens aged 21 or above . 
 Their names must appear in a current register of electors . 
 They must have been residents of Singapore for at least ten years . 
 They must be able to speak , read and write in at least one of the four official languages ( English , Malay , Mandarin and Tamil ) . 
 They must not be disqualified under Article 45 of the Constitution . 
 The Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act provide for a minimum of nine opposition representatives in Parliament . After the polling results for a general election have been released , the opposition candidates receiving the highest percentage of votes in their electoral divisions but not elected into Parliament will be offered NCMP seats . However , this is subject to several conditions . There must be less than nine opposition members voted into Parliament , and the candidate must have garnered at least 15 % of the total number of votes polled at the election in the electoral division he or she contested in . In addition , there can be no more than two NCMPs from one Group Representation Constituency ( " GRC " ) and no more than one NCMP from an electoral division that is not a GRC . 
 If the number of opposition candidates elected is less than nine , losing opposition candidates who have the highest percentage of votes during the election will be declared elected as NCMPs to make up the minimum number of opposition MPs . Hence , the number of NCMP seats offered is nine minus the number of elected opposition MPs . 
 In the event that a group of candidates contesting in a GRC is offered an NCMP seat , the group must decide within seven days the person or persons to be declared elected as NCMPs and notify the returning officer . Once an NCMP has been declared elected , he or she must take an oath of allegiance to Singapore and to " preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore " . If this is not done at the first or second sitting of Parliament during its first session after the general election , Parliament may by resolution declare that the NCMP 's seat has become vacant and that it will be filled by the next succeeding eligible candidate at the general elections , the candidates having priority based on the percentage of votes polled by them . 
 Opposition members who qualify to become NCMPs are allowed to reject their seats in Parliament . During the 2011 general election , several opposition leaders stated that they would not want to accept NCMP seats . Among them was Low Thia Kiang , the Secretary @-@ General of the Workers ' Party of Singapore ( " WP " ) . 
 = = = Parliamentary role = = = 
 NCMPs enjoy the same rights as MPs . They are allowed to engage in debate in Parliament and give their points of view . They are also allowed to vote on all issues with the exception of the following : 
 Amendments to the Constitution . 
 Any motion pertaining to a bill to amend a supply bill , supplementary supply bill or final supply bill . ( These are bills authorizing the Government to expend public money . )

 = = Reasons for the NCMP scheme = = 
 During the Second Reading of the NCMP bill , the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew presented to Parliament three main justifications for the NCMP scheme . First , he said that having a minimum number of opposition members in Parliament through the NCMP scheme would provide younger People 's Action Party ( " PAP " ) MPs with sparring partners to " sharpen their debating skills " . Secondly , the presence of opposition members in Parliament would educate the younger generation of voters about the role of a constitutional opposition and the limits of what it can do . He said this was especially important because the younger generation who had not lived and witnessed the conflicts within Parliament in the 1950s and 1960s " harbour [ ed ] myths about the role of an Opposition " and " had no idea how destructive an Opposition could be " . Thirdly , the presence of non @-@ PAP MPs in Parliament would act as a check and balance against any governmental impropriety . According to Lee , " some non @-@ PAP MPs will ensure that every suspicion , every rumour of misconduct , will be reported to the non @-@ PAP MPs " . The readiness of non @-@ PAP members to bring forth any allegation of misfeasance , or corruption , or nepotism would " dispel suspicions of cover @-@ ups of alleged wrongdoings " . 
 More importantly , the NCMP scheme was introduced to " ensure the representation in Parliament of a minimum number of Members from a political party or parties not forming the Government " . The PAP possessed " unbroken hegemony " in Parliament from 1968 until 1981 when J. B. Jeyaretnam won a seat in the Anson by @-@ election . As a result of his sole opposition presence in the Parliament , he could not initiate a meaningful debate in Parliament , being unable to find another MP to second his motions . The fact that there was absolutely no opposition representation in Parliament in the four general elections before 1984 ( as indicated in the table below ) added to the impetus for the inception of the scheme . 
 = = Criticisms = = 
 The NCMP scheme has been the subject of criticism , both within the PAP and among opposition MPs and Nominated Members of Parliament ( NMPs ) . During parliamentary debates in April 2010 on increasing the number of NCMPs from six to nine , several MPs expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of legitimacy and anti @-@ democratic nature of the NCMP concept . For instance , PAP MP Alvin Yeo expressed doubts as to whether the NCMP scheme had served to raise the level of debate in Parliament , while NMP Calvin Cheng said : 
 [ P ] eople who are proposed to be NCMPs are politicians who stood for an election and lost . Sir , they lost . They lost . I do not know how much more emphatic I can be about this . These are politicians who have stood on certain political platforms , for certain political issues and the majority of the electorate have considered these issues , these politicians and have rejected them at the polls . To then allow them into Parliament flies in the face of the logic of a democratic election at best and , at worst , is a slap in the face to the people who have voted against them . 
 The opposition has , from the introduction of the NCMP scheme , decried it as a " sham " and a " toothless " office . Opposition member J. B. Jeyaratnam questioned whether it was " a trick or a ploy " by the ruling party to maintain its dominance in Parliament . It has been argued that the system has placed the opposition at a disadvantage at general elections for a number of reasons . For one , there are restrictions on NCMPs as to what they can or cannot vote on in Parliament . Thus , it has been suggested that the presence of NCMPs in Parliament " does not seem to extend beyond the decorative and the provision of debating foils for the younger PAP generation unexposed to the gladiatorial quality of parliamentary debate " . Moreover , the effectiveness of the NCMP scheme is limited by the perception that the NCMP is obliged to be adversarial by virtue of being party to the opposition . This is so even if privately the Member can apprehend the benefits of a Government proposal . Finally , the NCMP scheme has been criticized as a ploy to discourage voters from voting in opposition MPs because of the guarantee of at least a number of NCMP seats . This inhibits the natural growth of an elected opposition voice in Parliament as the electorate 's motivation to vote in an opposition Member into Parliament is conceivably diluted by the assurance that a default mechanism exists for the " best losers " . 
 Opposition MP Low Thia <unk> has cited an NCMP 's lack of " muscle and real <unk> [ s ] grounding " as a reason for his refusal to take up an NCMP seat . NCMPs do not represent any constituency and are thus denied of opportunities to expand their influence . 
 During the 2010 debates , Sylvia Lim , then the sole NCMP in Parliament , commented that having NCMPs " make [ s ] a bad situation better , but increasing NCMPs is not the solution towards a more robust political system " . She identified an NCMP 's lack of any official capacity to represent the people or write letters on their behalf as a drawback of the scheme . Moreover , an NCMP has no physical base to organize activities or dialogues with the people . In her view , it would be better for politics in Singapore if the NCMP scheme was regarded merely as a " stop @-@ gap measure " to deal with the lack of alternative voices in Parliament as a result of the ruling party 's alleged abuse of the GRC system and gerrymandering . 
 In 2011 during a live television forum , Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong refuted claims that NCMPs were not a " real opposition " by stating that the PAP had introduced and expanded the scheme " because it acknowledged both the desire among Singaporeans for alternative voices and the need for an opposition to represent the diverse views in society " . He noted that NCMPs were free to debate issues in Parliament , and that the scheme provided opposition politicians with an opportunity to " establish themselves and strengthen their positions in subsequent general elections " . 
 = = List of NCMPs taking up seats in Parliament = = 
 In the 1984 general election , the first held after the NCMP scheme was introduced , as the opposition MPs J. B. Jeyaretnam of the WP and Chiam See Tong of the Singapore Democratic Party were elected to Parliament , the single NCMP seat available was allocated to the WP 's M. D. P. Nair . However , the WP decided that its defeated candidates should not take up NCMP seats . Jeyaretnam , the WP 's Secretary @-@ General , said that the " real object " behind the scheme was to persuade the electorate to return the PAP to all the seats in Parliament , which was " the antithesis of what Parliament is " . The NCMP seat was then allocated to Tan Chee Kien of the Singapore United Front , but his party also decided to reject the seat . This was regarded as a " resignation " , and the NCMP seat was thus not filled . 
 The first NCMP to take up a seat in Parliament , Dr. Lee Siew @-@ <unk> of the WP , did so following the 1988 general election at which Chiam See Tong was the only opposition MP elected . The WP 's Lee and Francis Seow were declared elected as NCMPs on 16 December 1988 . However , on 9 January 1989 the Speaker of Parliament Tan Soo Khoon announced that Seow had lost his seat with effect from 17 December 1988 under Article 45 of the Constitution after he was convicted and fined for tax evasion . In the general election that followed in 1991 , no NCMP seats were offered because four opposition members were successful in their respective electoral divisions , and thus the number of opposition MPs exceeded the three allotted NCMP seats . 
 In the 1997 general election , one NCMP seat was offered to , and accepted by , J. B. Jeyaratnam . He was declared elected with effect from 14 January 1997 . Subsequently , with effect from 23 July 2001 , Jeyaretnam fell into bankruptcy due to an unpaid debt and thus lost his seat in Parliament . The general election that year saw one NCMP seat occupied by Steve Chia of the Singapore Democratic Alliance . 
 In the 2006 general election , Sylvia Lim , Chairman of the Workers ' Party , garnered 43 @.@ 9 % of the votes in Aljunied GRC , making her the " best loser " of the election . She was subsequently declared elected as the next NCMP in Parliament on 12 May 2006 . 
 Following the increase in the number of NCMP seats in Parliament to nine in 2010 , since the Workers ' Party garnered six seats at the 2011 general election , three NCMP seats were offered . They were taken up by Lina Loh from the Singapore People 's Party who contested in <unk> Pasir Single Member Constituency ( SMC ) , and Yee Jenn Jong and Gerald Giam of the Workers ' Party who contested in Joo Chiat SMC and East Coast GRC respectively . 
 = = Notable issues raised by NCMPs = = 
 NCMPs have raised and debated in Parliament a wide range of issues . What follows are some of the more notable issues mentioned . 
 = = = Steve Chia = = = 
 In November 2002 , NCMP Steve Chia supported a motion by the Minister for Education stating that " this House ... ( 1 ) supports the new JC [ junior college ] curriculum which will better develop thinking , communication and other process skills and engage students in greater breadth of learning ; and ( 2 ) endorses greater diversity and opening of new pathways in JC / Upper Secondary education to cater to the different strengths and interests of students . " He suggested that there should be a focus on " creative spontaneity " , expressing the view that the education system in 2002 was one that focused on churning out a production line of workers , managers and instruction takers . Given that Singapore had reached the standards of a First World economy , Singapore should focus on instilling an inquisitive spirit within students , to encourage students to ask questions . He placed most emphasis on the importance of ensuring that the focus of education should be character building , stating : " It will be failure of our education system if we are to train our best and brightest with our best resources only to be told that they are going to be the <unk> of our society ; or that they lack the compassion for the weak and the down ; or that they behave in a snobbish class of their own ; or behave condescendingly to their peers and followers ; or that the elites only care about their own self @-@ interests . " 
 In 2003 , Chia mooted the idea that Singaporeans should be able to borrow from their own Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) savings to tide over periods of financial difficulty . His rationale was that if individuals could borrow from their own CPF accounts to buy depreciating property and money @-@ losing stocks , there was no reason why they should not be allowed to do so to pay for bills . Dr. Ong <unk> Hong , MP for Aljunied GRC , opposed the view , stating that it was important and for the good of Singapore that Singaporeans were independent individuals who could assume the risks and successes of their investments and be self @-@ sufficient . 
 With the advent of the Integrated Resorts , which are casino @-@ based vacation resorts , in 2005 Chia expressed concern in Parliament over whether the Government had systems and institutions in place to lessen their negative impact such as problem gambling and the spectre of people gambling away family assets . 
 = = = Sylvia Lim = = = 
 Sylvia Lim was an NCMP from 2006 till Parliament was dissolved in 2011 for the general election held that year , at which she was elected as one of the MPs for Aljunied GRC . While she was an NCMP , Parliament debated the Human Organ Transplant ( Amendment ) Bill 2009 which would permit an organ donor to receive a reasonable amount of payment as a reimbursement for medical checks , insurance and other medical expenses , and loss of income . Lim spoke of her worry that the bill might lead to a backdoor organ trading and profiteering . 
 In 2010 , Lim mooted the idea that the proportion of each Primary 1 cohort that would be seeking a university education should be increased beyond the 30 % by 2015 that the Government was planning . She noted that in Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development countries in 2006 about 37 % of each age cohort received a degree @-@ level education , and that a sizeable number of Singaporean students who failed to gain entry into local universities had done well in reputable universities overseas . She also suggested giving concessionary fares to disabled individuals who make up 2 % of the adult population under 60 years . 
 Lim expressed concerns about a proposed constitutional amendment introduced in April 2010 that would allow magistrates to hear what are called " first mentions " through video conferencing . A first mention is a hearing that must be held within 48 hours of a person 's arrest . She felt it failed to adequately assure accused people that they were allowed to complain to magistrates about injuries they had sustained or acts of misfeasance against them by the authorities . In response , Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng assured MPs that processes would be in place to ensure that accused people are treated fairly . For example , during a video conference , an accused person will be alone in a room with no police officer , and will be able to see what is happening in the entire courtroom . Secondly , the screen that will be used by the judge is large enough to enable him or her to clearly see whether the accused is under duress . Finally , accused people who have been mistreated can either complain to the police or to the judge when they are later present in court . 
 The following month , during parliamentary debates on major revisions to the Criminal Procedure Code , Lim suggested there was a need to improve pre @-@ trial disclosure procedures and to ensure that victims of crimes received redress . Further , she expressed concerns over the leniency of community @-@ based sentencing . The bill eventually incorporated several of her suggestions . 
 In 2011 , Lim noted that the Compulsory Education Act ensures that all children have the opportunity to receive an education . However , she expressed concern that processes for entry to schools for children with special needs were cumbersome . Furthermore , education for children with special needs was not subject to the same subsidies that students in mainstream schools had . She thus brought to the House 's attention the fact that special needs children might have been unintentionally marginalized . These concerns were supported by Penny Low , MP for Pasir Ris – Punggol GRC .

 = Eliel Saarinen 's Tribune Tower design = 
 Eliel Saarinen 's Tribune Tower design or the Saarinen tower are terms used to describe the unnamed and unbuilt design for a modernist skyscraper , created by Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen and submitted in 1922 for the Chicago Tribune 's architectural competition for a new headquarters . The winning entry , the neo @-@ Gothic Tribune Tower , was built in 1925 . Saarinen 's entry came in second place yet became influential in the design of a number of future buildings . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1921 – 22 , the prominent Tribune Tower competition was held to design a new headquarters for the Chicago Tribune , a major US metropolitan newspaper . It attracted 260 entries . First place was awarded to a design by New York architects John Mead Howells and Raymond Hood , a neo @-@ Gothic building completed in 1925 . Saarinen was awarded $ 20 @,@ 000 for second place ; his design was never constructed . Many observers felt that Saarinen 's simplified yet soaring setback tower was the most appropriate entry , and his novel modernist design influenced many subsequent architectural projects . 
 Saarinen was a veteran architect but had never before designed a skyscraper . To arrive at his noteworthy design , he took as a starting place the upward sweep of Gothic architecture , but then advanced this sense of verticality as his primary design principle . He said that through " logical construction " each portion of the design was made to reflect the larger goal of verticality . He was 49 years old when he submitted the design ; the next year he moved from Finland to the Chicago area . In the U.S. , he contributed to an overall design for the Chicago lakefront , and he lectured at the University of Michigan , but none of his skyscraper designs were ever built . Instead , others found success by incorporating his vision . Tribune Tower competition co @-@ winner Raymond Hood adopted Saarinen 's skyscraper style for several of his subsequent projects , and Saarinen 's design was emulated by other contemporary architects such as Timothy L. Pflueger , George W. Kelham , Hubbell and Benes , Holabird & Roche , Alfred C. Finn , and James Edwin Ruthven Carpenter , Jr . , as well as later architect César Pelli . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Respected Chicago architect Louis Sullivan offered high praise to Saarinen 's design , and said that his building indicated the future direction for the old Chicago School . Sullivan named Saarinen his stylistic successor . Chicago architects Thomas Tallmadge and Irving Kane Pond were also very vocal in their praise for Saarinen . Pond said Saarinen 's design was by far the best contest entry , that it was devoid of the superficial adornments featured on the winning entry , and free of the " stranglehold of conventional forms . " Tallmadge projected that Saarinen 's design would be transformative for American skyscrapers . He said that under Saarinen 's hand , the spirit of the skyscraper , " rid of its inhibitions and suppressed desires ... leaps in joyous freedom to the sky . " 
 Skyscraper Museum director Carol Willis , and art consultant Franck Mercurio , curator at the Field Museum in Chicago , offer moderating modern views about the influence of Saarinen 's design . Willis notes that setback architecture was being implemented in New York City highrises because of 1916 zoning ordinances related to building height and sunlight , and that Saarinen 's design was understood to be an embodiment of this trend . Mercurio points to the Tribune Tower competition entry from American architect Bertram Goodhue as having the same modernist features as Saarinen 's , with dramatic setbacks but a more pronounced simplification of the exterior . Mercurio argues that Goodhue 's design is a better example of modernism because it has less ornamentation . Goodhue 's entry gained him honorable mention but no cash award .

 The following buildings have been observed to be influenced by Saarinen 's 1922 design . 
 = Evolution ( advertisement ) = 
 Evolution is an advertising campaign launched by Unilever in 2006 as part of its Dove Campaign for Real Beauty , to promote the newly created Dove Self @-@ Esteem Fund . The centre of the Unilever campaign is a 75 @-@ second spot produced by Ogilvy & Mather in Toronto , Canada . The piece was first displayed online on 6 October 2006 , and was later broadcast as a television and cinema spot in the Netherlands and the Middle East . The ad was created from the budget left over from the earlier Daughters campaign , and was intended to be the first in a series of such online @-@ focused spots by the company . Later pieces include Onslaught and Amy . Evolution was directed by Canadian director Yael <unk> and Tim Piper , with sound design handled by the Vapor Music Group , and post @-@ production by SoHo . 
 The advert was a critical , popular , and financial success . It won a number of awards in the advertising industry , including two Cannes Lions Grand Prix awards and an Epica D 'Or . It has been discussed in many mainstream television programmes and print publications , and the exposure generated by the spot has been estimated to be worth over $ 150M . Evolution has also spawned numerous unofficial alternate versions , including a title sequence to a BBC sketch show and the short parody Slob Evolution , which has gone on to itself be nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award . 
 = = Sequence = = 
 The film opens with a " pretty , but ordinary girl " ( Canadian cartoonist and television producer Stephanie Betts , whom joint director Tim Piper later married ) entering and sitting down in a studio . Two harsh lights are switched on and the first bars of The <unk> 's " Passage D " , a breakcore @-@ piece with piano accompaniment , are heard . The short credits sequence provides the title of the film and credit to Dove . The camera then switches to a time lapse sequence , showing makeup and hair artist Diana <unk> making Betts up and adjusting her hair , transforming her into a " strikingly beautiful billboard model . " When the final physical adjustments of Betts 's appearance have been made , the team members all move off @-@ camera and a series of camera flashes begins as the photographer takes shots of Betts in various poses . 
 One shot is selected from the batch and moved into a generic image editing software interface , where a series of " <unk> " adjustments are made to alter Betts 's appearance even further , including , but not limited to : lengthening her neck , adjusting the curve of her shoulders , altering her hair and skin , and enlarging her eyes and mouth . The final image of Betts , now rendered almost unrecognizable , is then transferred to a billboard advertisement for the fictional " Easel " ( or " Fasel " ) brand of foundation makeup , and the video fades to the statement , " No wonder our perception of beauty is distorted . " The film ends with an invitation to take part in the " Dove Real Beauty Workshops , " the logo for the Dove Self @-@ Esteem Fund , and , in some versions , the website address of Unilever @-@ Dove 's Campaign For Real Beauty , for which the film was originally produced . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Dove Campaign For Real Beauty was launched by Unilever in 2003 , to coincide with the expansion of the Dove brand from soaps and other cleansing solutions to health and beauty products in general , including deodorants , shower gels , hair @-@ care and skin @-@ care products . The first stage of the campaign centred around a series of billboard advertisements , initially put up in the United Kingdom , and later worldwide . The spots showcased photographs of regular women ( in place of professional models ) , taken by portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz . The ads invited passers @-@ by to vote on whether a particular model was , for example , " Fat or Fab " or " <unk> or Wonderful " , and the results of the votes dynamically updated and displayed on the billboard itself . Accompanying the billboard advertisements was the publication of the " Dove Report " , a corporate study which Unilever intended to " [ create ] a new definition of beauty [ which ] will free women from self @-@ doubt and encourage them to embrace their real beauty . " 
 The series received significant media coverage from talk shows , women 's magazines , and mainstream news broadcasts and publications , generating media exposure which Unilever has estimated to be worth more than 30 times the paid @-@ for media space . Following this success , the campaign expanded into other media , including a series of television spots ( Flip Your Wigs and the Pro @-@ Age series , among others ) and print advertisements ( " Tested on Real Curves " ) . This culminated in the 2006 Little Girls global campaign , which featured regional versions of the same advertisement in both print and screen , for which Unilever purchased a 30 @-@ second spot in the commercial break during Super Bowl XL at an estimated cost of US $ <unk> 
 In 2006 , Ogilvy & Mather were seeking to extend the campaign further , by creating one or more viral videos to host on the Campaign for Real Beauty website . The first of these , Daughters , was an interview @-@ style piece intended to show how mothers and daughters related to issues surrounding the modern perception of beauty and the beauty industry . It was during the production of Daughters that a series of short films titled " Beauty Crackdown " , one of which was Evolution , was promoted to Unilever as an " activation idea " . The concept was one that art director Tim Piper pushed ; he proposed to have Evolution produced using the money left over from the budget for Daughters . This ended up amounting to a total of C $ 135 @,@ 000 . It was originally intended to get people to the Campaign for Real Beauty website to see Daughters , and to participate in the workshops featured on the site . 
 = = Production = = 
 The team brought together for the ad included director Yael <unk> , the first female director to win a Cannes Lion ( for <unk> , a campaign for the ALS Society of Canada ) , fashion photographers Tiko <unk> and Gabor Jurina , makeup artist Diana <unk> , art director Tim Piper , and Piper 's then @-@ girlfriend Stephanie Betts as the model . Betts , a cartoonist and producer of Canadian animated television programming such as Producing Parker , was chosen as the model for Evolution in part because Piper was first inspired to write the piece after seeing the amount of time his girlfriend spent applying make @-@ up , and he felt that she would be an ideal " representation of the norm " , highlighting the extreme changes that models undergo in the fashion industry . She was originally dubious about taking on the role but later stated that she was proud that she joined the campaign . 
 The actual production itself took place over the course of a single day , and over two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours of footage was taken for the make @-@ up portion of the film . This was eventually condensed to 23 seconds in the final version . The stage was dressed in a manner identical to that of modern fashion shoots , with the lighting and camera being positioned to remove any shadows from Betts 's face to aid in the post @-@ production retouching . Sound design took three weeks , and was divided into two sections . Fifteen hours were spent creating several mixes of " Passage D " with each mix tested and discarded before the version used in the final film was settled upon . A further nine hours were spent adding in the various background noises to the piece , including sped @-@ up human voices , a starter pistol and galloping racehorses . 
 Post @-@ production at SoHo was originally planned to take approximately three days , but it was extended to two weeks . Gabor Jurina , the photographer responsible for the digital retouching of the actual photographs taken of Betts during the shoot , supplied the post @-@ production team with 118 digital stills of the intermediate stages of the transformation from the " real " photograph of the made @-@ up Betts to the final image shown on the billboard . These were re @-@ cut and assembled to create the functions shown in the " <unk> " sequence , such as stretching Betts 's neck and adjusting the size of certain of her facial features . Other post @-@ production work included stabilising Betts 's head in the center of the shot during the make @-@ up sequence , covering certain continuity errors , creating and compositing the billboard advertisement , and constructing a false image @-@ editing interface . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Evolution was incorporated into the Canadian Campaign for Real Beauty website on 6 October 2006 in order to coincide with the start of the Los Angeles Fashion Week , and was uploaded by art director Tim Piper to video sharing website YouTube shortly after . While it has remained a largely internet @-@ based campaign , Evolution has appeared as a television commercial in the Netherlands and the Middle East , and in the U.S. inside commercial breaks in The Hills . 
 Once uploaded , the advert was viewed over 40 @,@ 000 times in its first day , 1 @.@ 7 million times within a month of its upload , and 12 million times within its first year . Even without having appeared offline , the advert was discussed by a number of mainstream television programmes , including Good Morning America , The Ellen DeGeneres Show , and The View , and news networks such as CNN , NBC , and ABC News ; the overwhelming majority came out in support of the campaign 's message . Spaces at the mother and daughter workshops sold out almost immediately , and the total exposure generated through the $ 50 @,@ 000 piece was estimated by Ogilvy & Mather in October 2006 as being worth around $ 150M . Comparisons have often been drawn up between the campaign and Dove 's earlier purchase of a 30 @-@ second spot for Little Girls during the Super Bowl XL . The Super Bowl spot cost an estimated $ 2.5M , reached an audience of 500 million , and generated only one third of the boost in traffic to the Campaign for Real Beauty website of Evolution . The spot was also credited for its part in producing double @-@ figure growth in sales of Dove product , and Unilever reported that its overall sales in the period following the release of Evolution rose by 5 @.@ 8 % , up from 3 @.@ 9 % the previous year . 
 Evolution was particularly popular with critics within the advertising industry , and has garnered a number of awards since its debut in October 2006 . It was the favourite in the run up to the Cannes Lions to win the festival 's Grand Prix in the Cyber category , generally considered one of the most prestigious awards in the industry . Ultimately , the prize went to three entries : Nike + , advertising the Nike brand , <unk> 15 MB of Fame , promoting fashion company Diesel S.p.A. ' s website and products , and Evolution . Evolution also went on to win the Grand Prix in the Film category , beating Pretty from Nike , Inc . , Paint for Sony 's BRAVIA line of high @-@ definition television sets , and The Power of Wind for the Wind Energy Initiative . The victory attracted a certain amount of controversy , as the jury switched Evolution from the " Fundraising & Appeals " category , whose entries are ineligible to win the Grand Prix , to the " Corporate Image " category at the last minute . Chairman of the jury Bob <unk> said of the decision , " We moved it into another category because we felt that strongly about it . We were not trying to break rules or set precedents , we just went with our hearts and minds , and asked the festival if we could move it . " As a result of the win , Evolution became the first entry in the festival 's history to take home Grand Prix awards from two categories and the first web @-@ based advertisement to win in the Film category ( followed in 2009 by Philips ' Carousel ) 
 The piece went on to win a number of other awards , including a silver Clio Award ( in the <unk> / Pharmaceuticals category ) , the Film Grand Prix and two Gold prizes at the London International Awards , an Epica D 'Or and Gold Prize in the Interactive category of the Epica Awards , among others .

 = = = Slob Evolution = = = 
 The popularity of Evolution and its presence on many video @-@ sharing websites led inevitably to a large number of alternate versions and parodies being uploaded by the public . In under six months , parodies on YouTube alone received over 5 million hits between them , Of these , by far the most successful was a professionally made piece entitled Slob Evolution . 
 Slob Evolution is an Emmy Award @-@ nominated short film created as a parody of the original Evolution spot in late 2006 . The piece was directed by Simon Willows , known for his work on the <unk> mineral water television and cinema commercials , and was produced by Claire Jones with the production company Blink Productions . Post @-@ production work was done by Framestore CFC . 
 In Slob Evolution , the role of the model is taken by a teenage boy who , instead of having make @-@ up applied in the time @-@ lapse sequence , is given fast food , alcoholic beverages , and cigarettes , transforming over the course of thirty seconds into an overweight middle @-@ aged slob . Further adjustments are made in a similar image @-@ editing interface to that used in Evolution , . The subject 's neck is shortened , his features made more asymmetric , and a tattoo is added . The image is transferred to a billboard advertisement for the fictional " <unk> " brand of " man cream " , and the piece ends with a fade to the statement , " Thank God our perception of reality is distorted . No one wants to look at ugly people . " 
 The parody was uploaded to video @-@ sharing website YouTube on December 4 , 2006 and was promoted only through a seeding of 30 e @-@ mails . Within its first month , Slob Evolution received over 278 @,@ 000 hits . It went on to be nominated for a number of prestigious awards , including the " Comedy : Short Form " and " Viral " categories of the 2007 Webby Awards , and in the " Outstanding Broadband Comedy " category of the 2007 Daytime Emmy Awards . The popular and critical attention that Blink Productions received for Slob Evolution led to Tiger Aspect , the production company behind the 2007 BBC comedy sketch show Ruddy Hell ! It 's Harry and Paul , contacting the production company to produce an introduction to the show in a similar vein . 
 The title sequence to Ruddy Hell ! It 's Harry and Paul begins with a shot of Morwenna Banks and Laura Solon . The familiar time @-@ lapse sequence shows the pair being given several pints of lager , cigarettes , and fast food . Their hair is cut and their make @-@ up removed as they slowly morph into Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse , the joint hosts of Ruddy Hell ! It 's Harry And Paul . After bras are removed from the pair 's shirts , the camera zooms out to show a billboard advertisement similar to that in Slob Evolution , with the show 's title displayed underneath .

 Shortly after releasing Evolution online , post @-@ production company SoHo uploaded a five @-@ minute making @-@ of documentary , which includes interviews with creative directors Janet <unk> and Tim Piper , photographer Gabor Jurina , post @-@ production director Paul Gowan , digital artists Kevin Gibson and Terry Rose , and sound designer Andrew Harris , who discuss the various stages of the post @-@ production process behind the creation of the spot . The making @-@ of also includes a shot of Evolution 's storyboard and a short segment of behind @-@ the @-@ scenes footage from the shoot itself , showing Stephanie Betts before and after the make @-@ up process . 
 After the debut of Evolution , Dove quickly ordered several follow @-@ up online advertisements , the first two of which ( Onslaught and Amy ) appeared online in October 2007 . These were also written and directed by Tim Piper . The pair are predicted to prove at least as popular as Evolution . Other companies have attempted to use the same formula , with mixed results . Among the more @-@ commented on campaigns is Beauty is ... , launched by Nivea in 2007 and comprising television , print , and online segments which push the same message as the Dove campaign .

Two NATO Apache helicopters an AC @-@ 130 gunship and two F @-@ 15E Eagle fighter jets entered by varying estimates as little as 200 meters ( 660 ft ) to up to 2 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 miles ) , into the Pakistani border area of Salala in the <unk> subdivision of Mohmand Agency , FATA at 2 a.m. local time , from across the border in Afghanistan and opened fire at two border patrol check @-@ posts , killing 28 Pakistani soldiers and wounding the 12 others . The two Pakistan Army check @-@ posts were codenamed " Boulder " and " Volcano " respectively . This attack resulted in a deterioration of relations between Pakistan and the United States . The Pakistani public reacted with protests all over the country and the government took measures adversely affecting the US exit strategy from Afghanistan including the evacuation of Shamsi Airfield and closure of the NATO supply line . 
 On 3 July 2012 , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton officially , however briefly , apologized for the losses suffered by the Pakistani military . Subsequently , Pakistan restored the NATO supply routes .

 The attacks caused the deaths of up to twenty @-@ four Pakistani soldiers , which included two officers – Major Mujahid Mirani and Captain Usman Ali . Thirteen other soldiers were injured as a result of the attack . Both sides reported they were attacked first . The poorly defined border , as well as a history of Taliban fighters moving around the Afghan border regions , were cited as possible contributing factors to the incident . 
 = = = = US @-@ Afghan claims = = = = 
 According to Afghan and US officials , the incident started after US @-@ Afghan coalition forces , which were conducting an operation against the Afghan Taliban in Afghanistan 's eastern Kunar Province , were fired upon from border positions within Pakistan . " There was firing coming from the position against Afghan army soldiers who requested support " , said one Afghan official in Kabul . The Afghan official further stated they were being fired upon directly from a Pakistani military outpost itself . A Western official backed up that view by stating , " They were fired on from a Pakistani army base . " And , " It was a defensive action . " According to Afghan and US accounts helicopters were then called in for support against the incoming fire . 
 A Pakistani defence official reportedly admitted that soldiers in the Pakistani border post sitting there for the express purpose of stopping infiltration fired a few flares , a couple of mortar rounds and one or two bursts of machine @-@ gun fire in that direction . 
 Another US official in Kabul pointed to an incident in September 2010 , when a NATO helicopter fired on a Pakistan outpost , killing two soldiers . " It was a situation where insurgent forces butted right up against a Pakistani border post and used that as a firing position . When we fired back , we hit Pakistani security forces . Military officials in Kabul claimed insurgents in Pakistan have also used empty Pakistan border bases to stage attacks , which they say may have been the working assumption of the coalition forces who called in the airstrike when they drew fire . 
 One US official said NATO forces had informed the Pakistani army 's 11th Corps command near the western border that operations against Taliban insurgents would take place on that day . Pakistani General Abbas admitted in a press conference that coalition forces had " informed our military earlier , much earlier , that they will be conducting an operation there . " 
 According to the US military , information about the proposed strike was passed on at one of the centres on the border where both sides station officers and exchange information in an effort to avoid firing on each other , after which Pakistani officers cleared the strike , saying that there were no Pakistani forces in the area . 
 = = = = Pakistani claims = = = = 
 The incident sparked outrage and controversy in Pakistan , which termed the attack an " unprovoked and indiscriminate firing , " an " irresponsible act , " and a " stark violation " of its sovereignty . Leaders of the Pakistani military establishment viewed NATO 's attacks on the army <unk> as intentional , pre @-@ planned and premeditated . <unk> NATO 's version of events as " lame excuses " , Pakistan rejected claims of any firing having emanated from its side as a prelude to the encounter , saying that the soldiers who were manning the post were asleep and resting when NATO launched the assault at night . The director general of the ISPR , Major General Athar Abbas challenged NATO to " present proof if they claim that firing was started from Pakistani side . No fire was opened from our side . " He asserted that " At this point , NATO and Afghanistan are trying to wriggle out of the situation by offering excuses . Where are their casualties ? " Meanwhile , the claim that the airstrike was cleared by Pakistani authorities was categorically denied by Pakistan which claimed that the attack continued for two hours , even after Pakistani officials alerted coalition forces to stop . 
 Preliminary reports from the Pakistan Army told of about 40 soldiers being present at the two check posts , most of whom were sleeping or resting when the raid took place . The helicopters first attacked the border post , named " Volcano " , atop the mountain peak . This initial attack cut all the communications to and from the post , and a Pakistan Air Force air support could not be called in time to counter the attack . Instead , Pakistani troops stationed at the nearby post named " Boulder " engaged the NATO helicopters with anti @-@ aircraft guns . The helicopters soon withdrew . 
 Pakistani authorities tried to contact their NATO counterparts in an effort to inform them of the situation but the Pakistani request reportedly failed to reach the attacking force . The helicopters returned a second time engaging Boulder border post again . A short while later communication with the NATO commanders was established and the attack was called off . All casualties were from the initial attack on the Volcano border post . Later , Major General Abbas expressed that it was beyond comprehension why the NATO forces returned to attack the second time . 
 According to local officials , there was no militant activity along the Afghan border region when NATO conducted the attack . Abbas , spokesperson ISPR , said that the coordinates of the two border posts had been given to ISAF . He added that the attack lasted for almost two hours and claimed that the personnel on the posts alerted the GHQ which in turn immediately informed the ISAF regional base in Afghanistan to stop the attack at roughly 12 : 30 AM but they did not . GHQ in return gave permission to the personnel on the outposts to retaliate . NATO communicated at roughly 1 : 15 AM that they had realised that they were attacking Pakistan Army and that their forces had been ordered to stop . Yet NATO 's aerial bombardment continued with another salvo aiming at the Pakistani rescue force that rushed to the aid of the two posts . Pakistan termed the event an " unprovoked and indiscriminate firing " , an " irresponsible act " , and a " stark violation " of its sovereignty . The attack was the deadliest NATO strike on Pakistani soil since the start of the war in Afghanistan . In a media conference with the Director General of Military Operations ( DGMO ) Major General Ashfaq , Chief of General Staff Lieutenant General Waheed Arshad , claimed that this was not an " unintended " incident . On accounts of series of events he commented that NATO was informed at the time of attack but their helicopters remained on course of aggression . Pakistani military also said that the NATO forces returned a second time to attack the post again . When he was asked whether Pakistan was satisfied with the investigating team headed under US Air force Brigadier General Stephon , he responded sharply by commenting that all incidents in past in relation to violation of Pakistan 's sovereignty did not come to an agreeable conclusion . Pakistan was invited to jointly investigate the incident , but Pakistan refused to participate . 
 On 9 December , Major General Ashfaq claimed that NATO had been monitoring radio transmissions that night and knew they had hit Volcano post . The Pakistani military called the strike " unprovoked and indiscriminate . " Government of Pakistan launched a strong protest with U.S and also immediately discontinued the supply to NATO troops located in Afghanistan . Notably , the strike on Saturday came one day after Gen. John Allen , the commander of the US @-@ led coalition in Afghanistan , visited Pakistani army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani . In that meeting , both the commanders discussed border co @-@ ordination and other measures " aimed at enhancing border control on both sides . " NATO attack shows that either Gen. John Allen lacks control over his troops based in Afghanistan or did negotiations while putting on the mask . 
 = = Repercussions of the incident = = 
 = = = Closure of NATO supply lines = = = 
 Pakistan immediately closed all NATO supplies to Afghanistan in the aftermath of the attack , leaving the blockaded supply trucks vulnerable to attacks . NATO trucks had been using the supply routes , in Khyber Agency ( through the Khyber Pass at <unk> ) and Balochistan ( near <unk> ) , to supply US and international forces fighting in Afghanistan . 
 US policy makers tried to find alternative routes through Russia , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan , and Tajikistan ( termed as the " Northern Distribution Network " ) but these are longer and less effective than routes through Pakistan . Huge costs are associated with the Central Asian supply lines , and NATO 's supply line through Russia is already under a looming danger of closure due to friction over missile defence plans . Being a landlocked country , Afghanistan is highly dependent on Pakistan for its imports . According to figures released by The Pentagon in January 2012 , the United States was paying six times more to send supplies to troops in Afghanistan via alternative supply routes following the closure of Pakistani routes . The figures placed the new US costs at $ 104 million per month , roughly $ 87 million costlier per month than when the cargo was transported via Pakistan . The high costs were associated with the routes being lengthier . 
 = = = = Continued strife = = = = 
 In late March 2012 , a US military official stated that the United States would have to use routes through the Northern Distribution Network ( <unk> ) for supplies to Afghanistan if Pakistan refused to reopen its supply lines . However , he conceded the <unk> of these routes and noted that negotiations with Pakistan regarding the possibility of opening of the supply routes were ongoing . After reviewing United States @-@ Pakistan relations and outlining what was needed to repair bilateral relations , the Pakistani parliament turned the decision of reopening the NATO supply lines over to the government in April 2012 . Due to an upcoming general election in Pakistan , with widespread anti @-@ American sentiments in the country , the Pakistani government was reluctant to reopen the lines , and postponed its decision until the United States responded positively to Pakistani demands outlined in the parliamentary recommendations , such as a US apology for the November 2011 incident , the bringing of those involved in the strike to justice , and a stop to US drone airstrikes . Talks between Pakistan and the United States failed in April 2012 after Pakistan could not get an unconditional apology from the United States for the November 2011 incident . The White House refused to apologise after Taliban attacks in Kabul and other cities in Afghanistan on 15 April 2012 , which according to US military and intelligence officials came from the Haqqani network , an Afghan group working from a base in North Waziristan along the Afghanistan border in Pakistan 's tribal belt . Pakistani officials said they cannot open the NATO supply routes in Afghanistan without a US apology . 
 Later in May , Pakistan demanded the United States to pay stiff fees as a condition to open up NATO supply routes into Afghanistan . The United States , however , could not pay the required $ 5 @,@ 000 per truck due to budgetary restraints according to US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta . " Considering the financial challenges that we 're facing , that 's not likely , " Panetta said of the Pakistani demand of $ 5 @,@ 000 for each truck carrying supplies across its territory for NATO troops waging the Afghanistan war . Unnamed US officials said that US officials said they had hoped a meeting between Pakistani Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and US President Barack Obama as well as sharing the spotlight with President Obama and other global leaders during the 2012 NATO Chicago Summit might provide an incentive for a deal on resuming supply shipments . " The invitation was an inducement to get them back into the international fold , " said a senior US official , speaking anonymously because of the sensitive issues . " But the Pakistanis couldn 't get their own act together " in time for the summit . " The main issue , it seems , is money . " 
 The United States and Pakistan had nearly completed a deal to reopen crucial NATO supply routes into Afghanistan in June 2012 , when Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said the US was " reaching the limits of our patience " over Islamabad 's failure to root out Afghan insurgents in its tribal areas . In the wake of <unk> comments deputy assistant secretary of Defense Peter Lavoy was not allowed to meet with the Pakistani Army Chief , General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , and the Pentagon announced that it was bringing home a negotiating team that had worked in the Pakistani capital for nearly two months to end the bitter impasse over the supply routes . A senior US official disputed the notion that Panetta 's criticism of Pakistan had set back the talks . " The sticking point for a long time has been the apology issue , " the official said . 
 = = = = Supply lines reopening = = = = 
 Pakistan decided to reopen the supply lines after US Secretary of State apologised on 3 July 2012 for the Salala incident via a telephone call to Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar . " Foreign Minister Khar and I acknowledged the mistakes that resulted in the loss of Pakistani military lives , " Clinton said in a statement . " We are sorry for the losses suffered by the Pakistani military . We are committed to working closely with Pakistan and Afghanistan to prevent this from ever happening again . " US Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta said in a separate statement that the US " remains committed to improving our partnership with Pakistan and to working closely together as our two nations confront common security challenges in the region " , US General John R. Allen said in a statement that the agreement is " a demonstration of Pakistan 's desire to help secure a brighter future for both Afghanistan and the region at large . " and NATO Secretary @-@ General Anders Fogh Rasmussen welcomed the announcement to reopen the supply lines , stating saying it highlighted the important role Pakistan has in supporting a stable future for Afghanistan . 
 Pakistani reactions to the US apology were different . " We appreciate Secretary Clinton 's statement , and hope that bilateral ties can move to a better place from here . I am confident that both countries can agree on many critical issues , especially on bringing peace to the region , " Pakistan 's ambassador to the US Sherry Rehman said in a statement . In general the decision to reopen the supply routes was met in Pakistan with a general sense of befuddlement and muted criticism that the Pakistani government had given up a much @-@ trumpeted increase in transit fees for NATO trucks . Opposition politicians criticised the move and demanded more of an explanation from the Pakistani government and military . " Now government should let the people know about the terms and conditions for reopening the NATO supply lines . What were the demands ? " said former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi . And Enver Baig , an opposition politician belonging to the Pakistan Muslim League @-@ Nawaz complained about Americans : " They did not apologize . They said ‘ sorry . ’ " Some Pakistani vowed civil disobedience to stop the convoys . " The decision to reopen NATO supplies is a big crime against the country , and we will not sit silently over this , " retired Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul , a leader of the Defense Council of Pakistan ( a coalition of Islamic parties that includes pro @-@ Taliban clerics and other foes of the NATO routes ) and a former chief of the Inter @-@ Services Intelligence agency , told the Pakistani cable channel Express News . " We will come to roads and streets and protest against the decision and will also try to stop the supplies . " Pakistani Taliban announced that they will attack any NATO supply trucks travelling along the routes . Transporters who resume supplies will be " considered a friend of the U.S. " and will face the consequences , a spokesman for the militant group said . Al Jazeera 's Kamal Hyder said that both NATO and Pakistani forces had taken into account losses in the past . " The losses , despite the fact that they have become a problem are nowhere near the levels that would cause alarm bells to ring " the correspondent said . According to his analysis it would cause a problem if " the Pakistani Taliban attack bridges or decide to take these people head on in the tribal areas " connecting Pakistan to the southern Afghan province of Kandahar . 
 American officials said according to the New York Times that Hillary Clinton 's increasingly cordial relationship with the young Pakistani foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar paid dividends in resolving the dispute between both countries over the Salala incident . A final agreement on the wording of Clinton 's statement of her conversation with Khar came after a week of marathon talks that included two trips to Islamabad by General John R. Allen , the US commander in Afghanistan , and a quickly arranged weekend trip by Thomas R. Nides , the deputy secretary of state for management and resources . In recent weeks Nides and Pakistani Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh had spearheaded the negotiations to reopen the supply lines . After weeks of behind @-@ the @-@ scenes phone calls , e @-@ mails and meetings between Nides and Abdul Hafeez Shaikh reached an agreement on the terms for the reopening of the NATO supply lines . Besides the US apology both sides agreed to the following : After initially demanding as much as $ 5 @,@ 000 for each truck Pakistan dropped its insistence on a higher transit fee for each truck carrying NATO ’ s nonlethal supplies from Pakistan into Afghanistan and agreed to keep the fee at the current rate of $ 250 . The Obama Administration will ask Congress to reimburse Pakistan about $ 1 @.@ 2 billion for costs incurred by 150 @,@ 000 Pakistani troops carrying out counterinsurgency operations along the border with Afghanistan . " With the <unk> open , we will look to pay past coalition support fund claims , " Pentagon spokesman Captain John Kirby said , using a Pentagon acronym for the supply routes . The United States military reimburses by " coalition support funds " Pakistan for logistical , military and other support provided to American military operations against militants , but these payments have been suspended since Pakistan shut off the routes . More precisely the US halted paying the bills from Pakistan as tension rose between the two countries . The Pentagon will now consult with Congress about paying the bills prior to paying Pakistan in full . 
 During their telephone call Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar made it clear to Secretary of State Clinton that no lethal equipment would transit into Afghanistan through the Ground Lines of Communication i.e. the ground supply lines except those meant for equipping the Afghan National Security Forces . Pakistan 's Defense Committee of the Cabinet , which approved the deal , said the agreement was in the country 's best interest and a boon to the Afghanistan peace process . Allowing NATO convoys to enter and exit Pakistani territory would speed the withdrawal of Western forces , the Pakistani government said in a statement , and " enable a smooth transition in Afghanistan . " According to the New York Times the agreement reflected a growing realisation by Pakistani officials that they had overplayed their hand , misjudged NATO 's resolve and ability to adapt to the closing by using an alternative route through Central Asia , and a recognition on both sides that the impasse risked transforming an often rocky relationship into a permanently toxic one at a critically inopportune time . Despite the resolving of the Salala incident there are frictions in both countries relations such as Pakistan 's opposition to US drone strikes on Pakistan soil , and Washington 's allegations that Islamabad condones , or even assists , anti @-@ American militants . 
 The deal ended a diplomatic deadlock that brought US relations with the nuclear @-@ armed South Asian nation to a near standstill and hindered counter @-@ terrorism operations against Pakistan @-@ based militants . Because of the supply lines closure the United States has spent at least an additional $ 100 million a month because it was instead forced to move supplies by air , rail or truck through Russia and other countries north of Afghanistan at much longer and more expensive routes . The closure of the supply lines complicated the American troop withdrawal from Afghanistan , cost the United States more than $ 1 billion in extra shipping fees as a result of having to use the alternative routes through Central Asia and also held up delivery of thousands of armoured vehicles and other equipment meant for the fledgling Afghan army and police , slowing US efforts to build Afghan forces that can stand up to the Taliban insurgency as foreign troops withdraw . The reopening of the supply lines means that the US will save hundreds of millions of dollars in the run @-@ up to the withdrawal of NATO forces from the Afghanistan and also that it would help the US and NATO to complete its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan " at a much lower cost " according to Clinton . Despite the reopening of critical supply routes from Pakistan , the US military confronts a giant logistical challenge to wind down the war in Afghanistan because it must withdraw till the end of 2014 nearly 90 @,@ 000 troops and enormous depots of military equipment accumulated over a decade of war which includes 100 @,@ 000 shipping containers stuffed with materiel and 50 @,@ 000 wheeled vehicles . 
 The above @-@ mentioned agreement between Pakistan and the United States was never an issue of money alone . " It was a matter of honor for the army , " said <unk> ur @-@ Rehman , a Pakistani defence correspondent for <unk> News , a cable channel . " The only word they were looking for was ' sorry . ' It was a matter of pride , a matter of honor , a matter of ego . " " If it had been about the money , it would have been done months ago , " said an US <unk> administration official knowledgeable about the negotiations . " Just like for us , it was not just about the supply routes . " According to the BBC the reason for the long US refusal to apologise for the Salala incident was deep anger among Americans about the death of US soldiers in Afghanistan from attacks by militant groups with alleged connections to Pakistan 's ISI intelligence agency . Another reason for the United States refusal to apologise was the determination by American military investigators that Pakistan was equally culpable in the Salala incident because Pakistani soldiers , stationed on a ridge overlooking the border , had fired first on US troops on the Afghan side of the border . Pakistan has disputed that conclusion , saying its forces did not fire first . 
 After the first NATO supply trucks crossed the Afghan border on 5 June 2012 , Pakistanis questioned the NATO supply line deal . " The US has not apologized formally , " said Nawaz Sharif , the leader of the main opposition party Pakistan Muslim League @-@ Nawaz . Imran Khan , another major opposition figure , went further , saying that " the decision isn 't only against national interest but can also stir unrest within the ranks of the armed forces . " He also criticised the incumbent government as being a pawn of the United States . Political and religious parties in <unk> undertook " long march " to Islamabad to protest reopening of supply routes to Afghanistan . Pakistan declared it will scan all NATO containers passing through the country to ensure they do not contain weapons and unapproved items will be seized . 560 @,@ 000 rupees ( $ 6 @,@ 000 ) compensation per vehicle would be paid to the truck owners by NATO subcontractors for being out of work for seven months because of the blockade according to Rana Mohammad Aslam , vice @-@ president of the All Pakistan Goods Carrier Association . 
 = = = Shamsi airfield vacated = = = 
 On 26 November , the same day the incident occurred , Pakistan ordered the US to shut down and vacate the Shamsi Airfield in the southwestern Balochistan province within a deadline of 15 days . US forces and the Central Intelligence Agency had reportedly leased this airbase in 2001 for joint surveillance and launching drone attacks against militants in Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan . The Shamsi airbase was the only military base in Pakistan being used by the United States , and orders of its evacuation by US personnel symbolised an increasing rift and deterioration in relations between Pakistan and the United States . 
 In early December , the US military personnel occupying the base , along with all military equipment , were shifted to the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan via US military aircraft . On 10 December , Pakistani troops from the Frontier Corps took full control of the airfield as scheduled , and by 11 December all remaining American staff were evacuated . Upon establishing control of the airfield , the United States flag was removed from the base and replaced with the flag of Pakistan . 
 The impact of the closure has been questioned , as the United States still has the ability to conduct drone attacks from nearby bases in Afghanistan , and according to the Pakistani military , the base was used mainly for refuelling and maintenance of drones , as well as for emergency landings and logistical support , and not for conducting actual drone operations which had in fact ceased in April 2011 . Following the incident , Pakistan stated its intention to shoot down any future US drones intruding on its airspace , and the US suspended drone operations to avoid antagonising Pakistan . One report said that American drone attacks in Pakistan dropped by as much as 50 % due to the Salala attack , as well as legal cases . 
 = = = United States exit strategy = = = 
 Among the immediate repercussions of the incident is that the United States ' attempts to end the war in Afghanistan peacefully may now be in jeopardy . Some Pakistani officials warned that the attack could have " huge implications " for the Afghan endgame . Pakistan , which is designated as a major non @-@ NATO ally by the United States and is seen as a key facilitator in bringing the United States to the negotiations table with the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani Network , had already halted those efforts according to an unnamed Pakistani official close to the military establishment . 
 While addressing a Senate committee , the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hina Rabbani Khar warned that a repeat incident could end Pakistan 's support to the United States in its war against militancy . " Enough is enough . The government will not tolerate any incident of spilling even a single drop of any civilian or soldier 's blood . Pakistan 's role in the War on Terror must not be overlooked . " She added that " the sacrifices rendered by Pakistan in the war on terror are more than any other country . But that does not mean we will compromise on our sovereignty . "

 In the wake of the NATO attacks , the Pakistani government refused to attend the Bonn conference scheduled on 5 December 2011 . The event in Bonn , Germany is an important international conference on Afghanistan . International pressure over Pakistan amounted as it refused to attend the Bonn conference . Secretary Hillary Clinton contacted the Pakistani Prime Minister but her plea was rejected because Pakistani public opinion prohibited attendance . The conference was generally regarded as a disappointment , partially because of Pakistan 's absence . 
 = = = Revision of western @-@ border rules of engagement = = = 
 Pakistan also strengthened its air defences and surveillance along the Afghanistan border as a precaution against any future incursions . DGMO Major General <unk> Nadeem was quoted saying " We can expect more attacks from our supposed allies " . Pakistan 's army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani issued directions to commanders posted at the border to fire without permission if any further aggression is received . According to a Pakistani security official , Pakistan had upgraded to a " fully equipped air defence system " on the Afghan border which has the capability of detecting , tracing and shooting down any aircraft . These weapons notably include indigenous shoulder @-@ to @-@ air Anza Mk @-@ III missiles and anti @-@ aircraft guns . The Pakistan Air Force cancelled leave for all its air reconnaissance @-@ related personnel and deployed aircraft to start a round @-@ the @-@ clock combat air patrol over the Afghan border to prevent all intrusions including drone attacks .

 The Foreign Ministry of Pakistan promptly lodged a protest with US ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter following the attack . In an official phone call to the United States , Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said that the attacks demonstrated " complete disregard for international law and human life " and were " in stark violation of Pakistani sovereignty . " Sentiments within the Pakistani military leadership suggested the attack as being a pre @-@ planned plot that was executed deliberately and intentionally . 
 Retired Brigadier Mahmood Shah , former chief of security in the tribal areas , said that so far the US has blamed Pakistan for all that is happening in Afghanistan and Pakistan 's point of view has not been shown in the international media , so the matter should be taken up by the United Nations Security Council . He advised Pakistani authorities to shoot down NATO aircraft should a similar event take place in the future , and to keep the supply lines closed , on the argument that the US cannot afford a war with Pakistan . The Inter Services Public Relations ( ISPR ) , a media wing of the Pakistani military , released a statement calling the attack unprovoked and said that chief of army staff , General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani had called the incident unacceptable and " directed that all necessary steps be under taken for an effective response to this irresponsible act " . One senior Pakistani military official said " the latest attack by NATO forces on our post will have serious repercussions as they , without any reasons , attacked on our post and killed soldiers asleep . " 
 The Pakistani Senate passed a unanimous resolution which denounced the attack and called it contrary to United Nations resolutions and international laws . Pakistan 's Interior Minister Rehman Malik commented on the issue clarifying that the supply lines have not been suspended , rather been permanently shut down and the trucks would not be allowed to cross the Pakistan @-@ Afghanistan border . The Minister of Information and Broadcasting <unk> Ashiq Awan urged the international community to condemn the incident to prevent such incidents in the future . The Governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Masood <unk> , termed the air strike as " deliberate " and asserted that claims over the incident being accidental were untrue . He also blamed the instability in neighbouring Afghanistan as a cause of instability in Pakistan . 
 The televised funeral ceremony of the soldiers who died was held in Peshawar and was attended by several high @-@ level military and political figures , including the Chief of Army Staff . Afterwards , their bodies were dispatched to their native towns for burial . The soldiers hailed from various regions , including three from Azad Kashmir alone , while the Major was from <unk> and the Captain from Sahiwal . Family members of Major Mujahid Mirani and Captain Usman Ali said the soldiers " sacrificed their lives " for the country and that they were proud of those sacrifices . The Army Chief later also paid a visit to the injured soldiers , who had been transported to the Combined Military Hospital ( CMH ) in Peshawar . 
 On 28 November 2011 , referring to Pak @-@ US military , intelligence , political and diplomatic co @-@ operation , the Pakistani Prime Minister announced that there would be no more business with the US and the relations between the two countries would never be the same again . Later the Director General of ISPR , Abbas , announced that NATO 's apology was not accepted and the attack would have serious consequences . He said that NATO 's regret over the attack was not enough and such incidents had happened in the past , killing 72 soldiers and injuring more than 250 troops in three years . While addressing a gathering of journalists at a military headquarters , Pakistan Army Major @-@ General Ashfaq Nadeem described the Salala incident as a " deliberate act of aggression " and said it was " next to impossible " that NATO did not know they were attacking Pakistani forces . 
 The next day , Pakistan 's ambassador to the UN , Hussain Haroon wrote to a letter to the UN Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ moon to inform him of the situation and requested that the statement be forwarded to the 193 @-@ nation general assembly and the 15 @-@ nation security council ( UNSC ) as a UNSC document . 
 Commenting on drone attacks , a senior Pakistani official said that predator drones " will never be allowed back , at Shamsi or anywhere else " although he hinted that American military trainers may be allowed back into the country to train Pakistani security forces . Pakistan had previously dumped American security personnel out of the country , following a covert operation by US special forces that killed Osama bin Laden in the town of Abbottabad in May 2011 and strained Pakistan 's relations with the United States . As of January 2012 , foreign affairs minister Hina Rabbani Khar said Pakistan 's ties with the United States were " still on hold " over the NATO air @-@ attack and that until the re @-@ evaluation was not complete , Washington could not ask Islamabad to pursue militant groups or assist in the Afghan peace process . 
 In May 2012 , Bilawal Bhutto Zardari , son of President Zardari and chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party , toughened his stance when he called on President Obama to " show some courage " and " apologise to Pakistan " over the raid . <unk> US demands for Islamabad to " do more " in the Afghanistan war , Bilawal remarked " it is time for the US to do more " . He called US drone operations a " constant irritant " to Pakistani public opinion and questioned whether the United States " actually considered Pakistan a military ally " , citing other controversial events such as the Abbottabad operation and the Raymond Davis incident . He also remarked that while he understood Obama was facing a re @-@ election , " the future of the NATO mission in Afghanistan should be more important than poll numbers " . 
 = = = Opposition political parties = = = 
 A PML ( N ) politician remarked that the government 's incompetence had allowed the attack to be carried out . Imran Khan , a popular opposition politician and former cricketer who has been a long @-@ time staunch critic of the government 's foreign policy and its decision to join the American @-@ led War on Terror , called the attack unpardonable during a political rally in Multan , and said the Pakistani government had wasted $ 70 billion belonging to the Pakistani people , as well as the lives of 40 @,@ 000 people , on fighting a counter @-@ productive American war : " I know that the government will not do anything except issue some silly comments against brutality even after this attack . I do not issue comments , I believe in taking action . " An Awami National Party politician and senator called the incident a terrorist attack . Awami Muslim League party leader Sheikh Rashid Ahmed supported a blockade of NATO supplies " to teach an unforgettable lesson to USA and NATO forces for violating Pakistani soil . " MQM chief Altaf Hussain condemned the attack and directed his party to observe a " Stability and Solidarity Day " . Former president Pervez Musharraf heavily criticised the attack while giving a telephonic conference to the Karachi Press Club and advised the government to take strict measures at a diplomatic level . Many other leaders also called on the government to pull out of the war in Afghanistan and disassociate itself from the US alliance . The <unk> called the attack a " shameful incident " and " a slap across the face of Pakistani foreign policy " adopted by rulers who " always bow before their foreign masters . " Protesters affiliated with the right @-@ wing Jamaat @-@ ud @-@ Dawa held a rally outside the Lahore Press Club where they urged the Pakistan Army to give a " befitting response " to NATO ; the leader of the party said " We have to eliminate all stations and bases given to the CIA if we want to end terrorism in Pakistan " . 
 = = = Public and media = = = 
 The NATO attack received considerable criticism and caused widespread outrage among the country 's civil society and media , with some perceiving it as an intentional act of war that may have been pre @-@ planned . Numerous protests were organised in several cities for a number of consecutive days after the attack occurred . Members of the public demanded an end to the US alliance and pressurised the government to consider pulling out from the War on Terror , permanently halt all NATO supplies , expel American citizens in Pakistan and plan a tit @-@ for @-@ tat military retaliation . Some locals in the tribal agencies demanded those who carried out the attack to be handed over to Pakistan . Hundreds of people organised a gathering outside the American consulate in Karachi to lodge a protest . Various lawyers ' associations throughout the country boycotted their usual court proceedings and observed a strike to mark the day . Many university students also boycotted their classes to protest . Students in Peshawar blocked a main road where they chanted " Quit the war on terror " and other anti @-@ American slogans . <unk> and students in Azad Kashmir expressed their outrage during a protest in the capital <unk> . Protests were also organised in the northern towns of Skardu in Gilgit @-@ Baltistan and Chitral . Some faculty members of the University of the Punjab , the country 's oldest university , passed a " resolution " in which they backed the Pakistan Army , stating that " Pakistan does not want war , but war is being imposed on it " and said the War on Terror was a " drama " staged by the " US elite " and a certain group of rich international bankers referred to as the " high cabal " by Winston Churchill who wanted to establish a " world government " . The Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce & Industry condemned the attack as well . Local television cable operators pulled out western channels such as BBC World News to deter what they called " anti @-@ Pakistan bias " in the media .

" We have a joint interest in the fight against cross @-@ border terrorism and in ensuring that Afghanistan does not once again become a safe haven for terrorists , " Rasmussen was quoted as saying . 
 The US Chief of Army Staff , General Martin Dempsey , said Pakistan 's anger was justified as it had a reason to be furious given the loss of life . However , Dempsey did not apologise , saying he did not know enough about the incident and an inquiry was still being conducted . A senior advisor to Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned that Pakistan and Afghanistan may be on a course toward military conflict . Hamid Karzai contacted the Pakistani Prime Minister to discuss the NATO strike and gave his condolences over the deaths of soldiers . 
 The commander of the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) , General John R. Allen , presented condolences to the family members and loved ones of the dead soldiers and ordered a " thorough investigation " into the matter . NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen wrote to Pakistan 's Prime Minister to say " the deaths of Pakistani personnel are ... unacceptable and deplorable . " 
 At the same time , US senators such as John McCain and Lindsey Graham said the United States needed to " fully review " its ties with Pakistan and consider enforcing cuts or new restrictions to military and economic aid , in response to attacks on American soldiers in Afghanistan which the United States accuses of having links to Pakistani intelligence agencies . 
 Dennis J. Kucinich , a US Congressman from Ohio , said while speaking at an event organised by the Association of Physicians of Pakistani Descent of North America ( <unk> ) that the United States must apologise to Pakistan and pay reparations to the families of the soldiers , adding : " I ’ m aware of complexities around US @-@ Pakistan relations , but you are our brothers and sisters , and we need to help facilitate those who want to take care of people here . " 
 The US embassy in Islamabad released a video statement on YouTube featuring Ambassador Cameron Munter standing in front of the American and Pakistani flags , in which he expressed his regrets for the attack . Giving his condolences , Munter said the United States took the attack " very seriously " and pledged " a full , in @-@ depth investigation . " He also pointed out that Pakistan and the United States had been friends for over 60 years and that having " weathered previous crises together " , he was certain they would both " weather this one too " to emerge as stronger partners .

 Russia : The Russian foreign minister stated it is unacceptable to violate the sovereignty of a state , even when planning and carrying out counter @-@ insurgent operations . In January 2012 , reports emerged that Pakistani foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar was set to leave for Moscow in the first half of February to formally invite Russian president Dmitry Medvedev to pay a state visit to Pakistan . If Medvedev accepts the invitation , he would be the first Russian head of state to visit the country . The move is believed to be part of changes in Pakistan 's foreign policy which include efforts to open up relations with other regional powers following strains in relations with the United States . 
 Sri Lanka : Thousands of Sri Lankan protesters attended a gathering in a public square in Colombo organised by the Pakistan Sri Lanka Friendship Association and the National Freedom Front ( a political party and ally of the ruling coalition government ) , condemning the NATO 's actions and asking the US to " stop terrorizing Pakistan " .

The Shamsi Airbase is believed to be under the control of the UAE , which leased it in the 1990s for facilitating visits of wealthy Arabs who used to visit Pakistan for falconry and hunting trips . The UAE is reportedly the party which allowed the US to use the air base for military purposes .

 John Rees , a British socialist and anti @-@ war political activist , called the NATO attack an " extremely dangerous incursion " and argued that the US and its allies were creating instability in the nuclear @-@ armed country . Ahmed Qureshi , an Islamabad @-@ based analyst , said during the same interview with state @-@ run Russia Today that the prevailing public outrage may force the government and the army to take some decisive measures against the United States . 
 Australian analyst Brian <unk> said the attack would have severe consequences : " This is quite outrageous and I have no doubt it signifies the end of the last lingering shreds of trust that the Pakistani army had for the U.S. " . According to <unk> , the USAF had full knowledge of the locations of Pakistani border posts , and thus there was no excuse for this incident . 
 An article from the Asia Times by M K <unk> explains that US should learn from its experience with Iran . It has no answer to a resolute nation in its will to put up against an enemy and Pakistan is going to give a " Persian response " this time if the intention was to intimidate its army . According to <unk> , Pakistan 's calculated response following the attack stops short of directly terminating its participation in the war although in essence , this event may push Pakistan 's army " within inches of doing that " in the long @-@ term scenario . 
 A report published in the newspaper Pakistan Observer claimed that some military and defence observers at Islamabad believed NATO was playing a double game and was in league with the Tehrik @-@ i @-@ Taliban ; according to the report , there was a theory being circulated which suggested that the attack carried out by NATO came just when some Tehrik @-@ i @-@ Taliban ( TTP ) militants from Afghanistan who had entered the region had been completely encircled by Pakistani forces and were about to be eliminated " within the next few hours " . These check posts were there to check them and prevent from crossing the border in to Pakistan . Pakistani monitors and experts on Afghanistan believed that at least two Afghan military officials deployed on the border , Brigadier General <unk> <unk> and Colonel Numan <unk> ( of the 201st <unk> Corps ) , have anti @-@ Pakistan sentiments and links to anti @-@ Pakistani elements . 
 An article published in People 's Daily , China 's top state newspaper , accused the United States and NATO of flouting international law and fanning terrorism . Simultaneously , many Chinese scholars , analysts and members of leading think tanks also expressed strong criticism of NATO 's attack . A former spokesperson for the US state department said China , which is a close ally of Pakistan , " sees this as a target of opportunity , both to tweak the US and to subtly suggest to Pakistan that if it really sours of its relationship with the US , it has an alternative " . 
 Writing for the Pakistani newspaper Express Tribune , Indian blogger Sanjay Kumar said the attack had elicited various reactions in India , with some vocal sections who saw Islamabad in " the prism of prejudice and paranoia " expressing glee and delight at the discomfort and supposed humiliation of their arch @-@ rival western neighbour . Kumar opinionated that " such sick thought has many takers in this healthy democracy which prides itself as the voice of the third world countries " . An opinion piece by Abdul Ruff <unk> published on the Indian Muslim Observer titled " NATO terrorism in Pakistan " said that Pakistan 's leadership was " interested mainly in promoting US imperialist goals and western capitalist interests " rather than protecting the interests of its people .

 Tremplin du Praz is a ski jumping hill at Le Praz in Courchevel , France . The complex consists of four hills : a large hill with construction point of K @-@ 120 and hill size of <unk> , a normal hill at K @-@ 90 and <unk> , and two training hills at K @-@ 60 and K @-@ 25 . The complex also has a cross @-@ country skiing stadium used for Nordic combined . Jörg <unk> holds the large hill winter record of 134 @.@ 0 metres and Nicolas Mayer the normal hill record of 100 @.@ 5 metres . 
 La Praz received its first ski jumping hill in 1944 . Ahead of the 1992 Winter Olympics , the large and normal hills were built along with a cross @-@ country stadium to host ski jumping and Nordic combined events . Since 1997 , the hill has hosted an annual summer FIS Ski Jumping Grand Prix event . It has also been used for one FIS Ski Jumping World Cup and two FIS Nordic Combined World Cup rounds , in addition to four events of the FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup . The medium hill opened in 2004 and the small hill in 2008 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The first ski jump in Courchevel was built on the location of the large hill in 1944 . It was followed by a second in 1955 , located in Courchevel 1850 . The hills were used to incorporate ski jumping into the Alpine skiing training programs . In 1970 , a larger 50 @-@ metre hill was built in Courchevel 1850 . It was supplemented with a small 25 @-@ metre hill in the early 1990s . 
 In the Albertville bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics , La Praz was designated the host of the ski jumping and Nordic combined events . The site was chosen because it was sheltered from the wind , had good exposure to the sun and predictable snowfall . Planning for the new venue started in 1988 , after Albertville had been selected to host the games . The hills were designed so both could be used simultaneously , if desired . During the 1988 Winter Olympics , the ski jumps at Canada Olympic Park were subject to strong winds and several of the competitions were postponed . To avoid such inconveniences , Tremplin du Praz was built into the mountain side to minimize wind exposure . Although the size of the hills remained the same , the 1992 Olympics were the first to measure the sizes in construction points ( K @-@ points ) . 
 In 2004 , the venue was upgraded for € 1 million by installing a K @-@ 60 inrun between the normal and large hill . This allowed the medium inrun to use the same outrun as the normal hill . In 2008 , a small K @-@ 25 hill , named <unk> , was installed slightly away from the main hills . The venue 's certificate was due to expire in 2011 , after which the venue would have to meet the International Ski Federation 's ( FIS ) latest regulations . A € 1 @.@ 5 million upgrade program was initiated , which saw the <unk> renovated , including installation of the Ski @-@ Line track system and new <unk> ceramic tracks . The <unk> saw new plastic mats and a new sprinkler system . The Nordic House , a sports centre , was also built . Construction started on the normal hill in May 2011 and on the large hill in August 2011 , with completion scheduled for early 2012 .

 The venue is located in Le Praz , also known as Courchevel 1300 , a village at the base of the Courchevel skiing resort . The venue is 1 @,@ 300 m ( 4 @,@ 300 ft ) above mean sea level and consists of four jumps . The large hill has a K @-@ point of K @-@ 120 and a hill size of <unk> . The normal hill has a K @-@ point of K @-@ 90 and a hill size of <unk> . The medium hill , with a K @-@ point of K @-@ 60 and hill size of <unk> , shares its outrun with the normal hill . The small hill , <unk> , has a K @-@ point of K @-@ 25 and a hill size of <unk> and is located away from the rest of the complex . The large and normal hill have an take @-@ off angle of 11 @.@ 5 ° and 10 @.@ 5 ° , and a landing angle of 37 @.@ 5 ° and 36 ° , respectively . 
 The venue covers an area of 0 @.@ 4 hectares ( 1 acre ) and features a judge tower , distance and speed measuring equipment , a weather station , snowmaking equipment , scoreboards and athlete preparation cubicles . The venue has 50 commentator booths , a VIP area and stands for 23 @,@ 000 spectators .

The Nordic House consists of rooms for organizers , accommodation for ski jumpers , stands for 200 spectators , a sports hall and a fitness centre . 
 Adjacent to the hills is stadium used for cross @-@ country part of Nordic combined . The stadium area is 0 @.@ 2 hectares ( 0 @.@ 49 acres ) and is made up of a timing and jury tower and preparation cubicles . There is capacity for 15 @,@ 000 spectators . For the Olympics , a 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) long loop was added , which ran around the village to the neighboring village of Saint @-@ Bon and back . Roads were crossed on wooden bridges and underpasses . The loop involved an extra round around the stadium area , with an altitude difference of 84 m ( 276 ft ) and a maximum climb of 43 m ( 141 ft ) . The total climb for the 15 kilometre individual Olympic race was 546 metres ( 1 @,@ 791 ft ) and for the 3 × 10 kilometre 346 m ( 1 @,@ 135 ft ) . Cross @-@ country proper was held at Les <unk> .

 Tremplin du Praz hosted the ski jumping events and the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined at the 1992 Winter Olympics . The format went unchanged from the previous games , but the Albertville Olympics were the first to see the mainstream use of V @-@ style . The large hill competition was won by Austria 's Ernst Vettori , the normal hill event was won by Finland 's Toni Nieminen and the team event was won by Finland . Nieminen , Vettori and Austria 's Martin Höllwarth collected medals in all three events . In Nordic combined , France won a double with Fabrice Guy and Sylvain Guillaume in the individual event , while Japan won the team event . 
 The hill was scheduled to host two FIS Ski Jumping World Cup events in January 1991 , but they had to be cancelled due to lack of snow . In 1993 , the hills hosted a single large hill World Cup event . Since 1997 , Tremplin du Praz has been used annually for the FIS Ski Jumping Grand Prix , the premier international summer ski jumping tournament . Originally it consisted of a single competition in the large hill , but from 2010 , a qualification run was introduced the day before the main event . The venue has hosted the FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup four times , in 2000 , 2002 , 2010 and 2011 . In February 2006 , the venue hosted two FIS Cup competitions in the normal hill . In January 2007 , Courchevel hosted two rounds of a FIS @-@ organized junior ski jump in the normal hill . In Nordic combined , the venue has hosted the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup twice , in 1991 and 1992 . It also held a World Cup B event in 1997 . The venue has been a popular training venue for national teams , and Germany often holds summer training in Courchevel .

 King 's Highway 412 , or simply Highway 412 , is a tolled controlled @-@ access highway in the Canadian province of Ontario . The route is approximately 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) long , connecting Highway 401 with the eastern extension of Highway 407 . The route lies entirely within Whitby in the Regional Municipality of Durham , travelling within one kilometre of the border between Whitby and Ajax and Pickering ( Lake Ridge Road ) . 
 During planning , the route was known as the West Durham Link . Its designation as Highway 412 , the first new 400 @-@ series designation in several decades , was confirmed along with Highway 418 on February 6 , 2015 . Although initially planned to open in October 2015 , the opening was delayed until June 20 , 2016 . Highway 412 opened alongside the extension of Highway 407 ( Highway 407E ) from Brock Road in Pickering to Harmony Road in Oshawa . The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario ( MTO ) announced that the route would be free to travel until 2017 to make up for delays . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Highway 412 is a 10 @-@ kilometre ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) four @-@ lane highway extending from Highway 401 to Highway 407E , just north of Highway 7 . The entire length of the route lay between Lakeridge Road and Coronation Road , within Whitby . At the southern end , the route begins at a three @-@ level stack interchange with a realigned Highway 401 , from which it proceeds north . It crosses Dundas Street ( former Highway 2 ) , where a partial interchange provides access to the north and from the south . 
 North of Dundas Street , the route swerves westward onto the alignment of Halls Road and crosses Rossland Road ; a future interchange is planned at this location . It continues north to a planned interchange with Taunton Road before diverging east from the Halls Road alignment to travel parallel between it and Coronation Road . The route crosses Highway 7 ( Winchester Road ) , where a partial interchange provides southbound access and a northbound exit ; a commuter carpool parking lot lay on the northwest corner . Immediately north of Highway 7 , the route ends at a three @-@ level stack interchange with Highway 407E . 
 = = History = = 
 The West Durham Link , as it was then known , was first presented to Whitby Council on February 10 , 1992 . It quickly drew the ire of local residents fearful of noise levels and the environmental effects on Lynde Creek . However , the recession of the mid @-@ 1990s resulted in Highway 407 being truncated in Markham temporarily . Slightly revised plans for the links appeared on the June 2007 Technically Recommended Route Report for the extension of Highway 407 to Highway 35 / 115 , which was submitted as part of the environmental assessment ( EA ) for the extension , but had been announced earlier that year on March 7 by the Government of Canada , as part of an investment in Greater Toronto Area infrastructure . 
 The EA report was released on August 17 , 2009 , including detailed plans for the configuration of the interchanges along the new highway . The route will run parallel to and east of Lake Ridge Road , partially overlapping the current route of Halls Road and partially along a new alignment one lot to the east . Both Halls Road and Coronation Road will be re @-@ aligned to accommodate the new highway . It will be six lanes throughout its length , with a concrete Ontario Tall Wall as a median . Highway 412 will cut into Lynde Creek , a small waterway that flows out to Lake Ontario . 
 Construction was underway by late 2013 . On February 6 , 2015 , it was announced by the MTO that the West Durham Link would be designated Highway 412 . Whitby Town Council has recommended to the province the route be named after Jim Flaherty . 
 Although initially expected to be completed on December 18 , 2015 , delays resulted in the opening being postponed until June 2016 . The highway was opened , alongside Highway 407E between Brock Road in Pickering and Harmony Road in Oshawa , on June 20 , 2016 .

 While watching television , the Simpson family sees a commercial for the " Bi @-@ Mon @-@ Sci @-@ Fi @-@ Con " , a science @-@ fiction convention featuring Mark Hamill and others , and decide to attend . A riot breaks out at the convention after Hamill offers the chance for someone in the crowd to act out a scene with him . Homer notices that Mark Hamill and Mayor Quimby are in danger of being trampled due to the riot and quickly rescues them . In gratitude , Quimby employs Homer as his bodyguard . 
 Homer begins training at " Leavelle 's Bodyguard Academy , " where he quickly graduates and begins his new job . Unbeknownst to Homer , Quimby made a deal with Fat Tony shortly after Homer was employed to provide milk to the schools of Springfield . Homer discovers the milk is from rats and confronts Quimby , accidentally knocking him out a window . Discovering Quimby hanging from a ledge , Homer makes him promise to expose Fat Tony in return for being pulled to safety . 
 Quimby organizes the arrests of Fat Tony and his men , but Fat Tony threatens Quimby 's life . Scared at having to defend Quimby due to the death threats , Homer attempts to reassure the Mayor by taking him to a dinner theater to see Mark Hamill portray Nathan Detroit in Guys and Dolls . Homer discovers Fat Tony is there alongside his henchman , Louie , having been released on bail , and unwittingly made the situation worse when he did what Fat Tony told him to do by planting a kiss on Mayor Quimby , oblivious to the fact that he had given the Mayor the kiss of death . Louie attempts to stab Quimby but is stopped in a scuffle with Homer after Hamill advises Homer to " use the forks . " However Fat Tony is still able to savagely beat Quimby with a baseball bat . Hamill says to Homer that Quimby will be fine , and Homer helps Hamill escape from the paparazzi .

 Ron Hauge , writer of the episode , wanted to do an episode where he would use Homer 's qualities such as <unk> , brute strength , thickness , and loyalty , for good . When Lisa says they have to go back for Maggie after the family escape the riot , Homer says " Forget Maggie , she 's gone . " Matt Groening claims this to be one of his favorite quotes in the show . Hamill only agreed to guest star if he was allowed to voice a character as well as himself . He stated that he loved doing the voice for bodyguard instructor Leavelle a lot more than he did providing the voice for himself .

Homer and Mayor Quimby attend a production of the musical Guys and Dolls ( 1955 ) , starring Hamill as Nathan Detroit , who sings the Star Wars @-@ themed " Luke , Be a Jedi Tonight " to the tune of " Luck Be a Lady " . 
 Leavelle 's design is based on Texan detective Jim Leavelle , as he appeared when guarding Lee Harvey Oswald in the photograph of Oswald 's death at the hands of Jack Ruby following the former 's arrest for assassinating President John F. Kennedy in 1963 . Leavelle trains the bodyguards by pretending to shoot their <unk> from a grassy knoll on a cart . This is a reference to the grassy knoll at Kennedy 's assassination location Dealey Plaza and a scene from the Kennedy assassination film Executive Action ( 1973 ) . 
 The plot shares elements with the film The Bodyguard ( 1992 ) , particularly Homer carrying Hamill away from the crowd at the end . Leavelle sings the song " I Will Always Love You " by Dolly Parton which was popularized by Whitney Houston as the theme for The Bodyguard ; it also plays at the end . After believing he has killed Mayor Quimby , Homer decides to take inspiration from the film Weekend at Bernie 's ( 1989 ) and " use the body to stage an elaborate farce . " The title of the episode is a reference to the film Married to the Mob ( 1988 ) .

 = = Background and writing = = 
 The song was originally written by Stefani and Stewart during Stefani 's visit to boyfriend Gavin Rossdale in London . The two used backward string samples to write the song in only ten minutes . The song describes Stefani 's relationship with Rossdale , and the line " You 're really lovely underneath it all " comes from a journal entry that Stefani made after spending a day in the park with Rossdale . Guitarist Tom Dumont commented that Stewart 's experience helped them keep the song simple because he " would have way overthought those chord changes . " When the band was working on the album in Jamaica , producers Sly & Robbie called dancehall artist Lady Saw to have her contribute a guest toast . After listening to the track , Lady Saw wrote and recorded her part on the spot .

 The song is a love song composed in the key of E major . It is written in common time and moves slowly at 69 beats per minute . Stefani avoids the heavy vocal vibrato that she often uses . Her vocal range spans under an octave and a half during the song , from F # 3 to B4 . 
 The song opens with a line sampled from Bob Clarke 's Sunday radio show on <unk> FM . The verses use a simple I @-@ vi chord progression , alternating between a first inversion E major chord and a second inversion C # minor chord , played on the off @-@ beats and switch to a IV @-@ iii progression . Each verse is followed by the chorus , which uses a I @-@ IV @-@ V @-@ IV progression . After the bridge , Lady Saw performs her toast . Stefani then sings the chorus twice , and Clarke closes the song after Stefani repeats the line " <unk> mm mm underneath it all " four times .

 " Underneath It All " received mixed reviews from music critics . Rolling Stone found its ska sound and Stefani 's questioning whether or not Rossdale is her soulmate tired . LAUNCHcast agreed the beat was one " that Sly & Robbie can do in their sleep " but added that the song " keeps its modern edge thanks to Lady Saw 's cooling rap . " Kitty Empire writing in NME also gave Lady Saw 's toast a positive review , stating that it " does an excellent job of sexing up all the sugar . " Stylus Magazine was pleased with Stefani 's performance on the song , stating that " she lets her voice ride gently on top of the melody , pushed along by the gentle steel drums in the background . " PopMatters commented that " No Doubt isn 't afraid of working with new ideas " but that the dancehall of " Underneath It All " was unsuccessful and sloppy . In its review of The Singles 1992 @-@ 2003 , OMH Media described the song as " an embarrassingly self @-@ conscious reggae pastiche , unimproved by a guest rap from Jamaican dancehall queen Lady Saw .

 = = Music video = = 
 The song 's music video was directed by Sophie Muller and directing collaborative Logan . It opens with a sequence of Stefani , as shown on the cover of the CD single , removing several pieces of clothing and later lying on a bed . After a scene with her in front of a white heart with roses , bassist Tony Kanal and drummer Adrian Young play basketball while Stefani stands against the wall . Stefani is then shown against a sparkling sky , followed by a scene of the whole band bicycling during Lady Saw 's toast . The video closes with a scene of Stefani jumping on a bed in white undergarments and without makeup . 
 Muller wanted to add more sexual themes to the look of the video to contrast with the innocence of the song 's lyrics . The original idea for the video was to show Stefani with heavy makeup " really over done like a stripper " and have her remove her clothing throughout the video . Muller found that this complicated the video too much , so each sequence shows Stefani with progressively less makeup instead . Muller decided to use a color scheme with bright colors such as orange , lime green , and pink , and the contrast was increased using Symphony in post @-@ production . The bicycling scene was to originally show footage that the band shot while recording in Jamaica since Stefani wanted to include a Jamaican theme . Instead , the scene was created by filming the individual band members on a twelve @-@ foot turntable in front of a bluescreen . Tracks were used to shoot two members riding next to each other , and Logan used computer @-@ generated imagery to show the entire band bicycling in Jamaica . 
 The music video was successful on video channels . It debuted on MTV 's Total Request Live 7 October 2002 at number seven . It reached number five on the countdown and was on the program for twenty @-@ four days . " Underneath It All " peaked at number two on MuchMusic 's Countdown in September 2002 . The video received nominations for Best Pop Video and Best Cinematography at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards , but lost to Justin Timberlake 's " Cry Me a River " and Johnny Cash 's cover of " Hurt " respectively .

 The saxaul sparrow ( Passer ammodendri ) is a passerine bird of the sparrow family Passeridae , found in parts of Central Asia . At 14 – 16 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 5 – 6 @.@ 3 in ) and 25 – 32 grams ( 0 @.@ 88 – 1 @.@ 13 oz ) , it is among the larger sparrows . Both sexes have plumage ranging from dull grey to sandy brown , and pale brown legs . Females have less boldly coloured plumage and bills , lacking the pattern of black stripes on the male 's head . The head markings of both sexes make the saxaul sparrow distinctive , and unlikely to be confused with any other bird . Vocalisations include a comparatively soft and musical chirping call , a song , and a flight call . 
 Three subspecies are recognised , differing in the overall tone of their plumage and in the head striping of the female . The subspecies ammodendri occurs in the west of the saxaul sparrow 's range , while stoliczkae and nigricans occur in the east . This distribution falls into six probably disjunct areas across Central Asia , from central Turkmenistan to northern Gansu in China . A bird of deserts , the saxaul sparrow favours areas with shrubs such as the saxaul , near rivers and oases . Though it has lost parts of its range to habitat destruction caused by agriculture , it is not seriously threatened by human activities . 
 Little is known of the saxaul sparrow 's behaviour . Often hidden in foliage , it forages in trees and on the ground . It feeds mostly on seeds , as well as insects while breeding and as a nestling . When not breeding it forms wandering flocks , but it is less social than other sparrows while breeding , often nesting in isolated pairs . Nests are round bundles of dry plant material lined with soft materials such as feathers . They are built in holes in tree cavities , earth banks , rocky slopes , and within man @-@ made structures or the nests of birds of prey . Two clutches of five or six eggs are typically laid in a season . Both parents construct the nest and care for their eggs and young . 
 = = Description = = 
 The saxaul sparrow is one of the larger sparrows at 14 – 16 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 5 – 6 @.@ 3 in ) and 25 – 32 grams ( 0 @.@ 88 – 1 @.@ 13 oz ) . Wing length varies from 7 @.@ 1 to 8 @.@ 1 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 8 to 3 @.@ 2 in ) , with males generally being larger . The tail is short at 6 @.@ 3 – 6 @.@ 95 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 48 – 2 @.@ 74 in ) . The saxaul sparrow 's legs are pale or pinkish brown , with a tarsus length of 1 @.@ 95 inches ( 50 mm ) . Its bill is 1 @.@ 0 – 1 @.@ 3 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 39 – 0 @.@ 51 in ) long , pale grey on the juvenile , pale yellowish with a black tip on the breeding female , and black on the breeding male . Like all other sparrows , it flies swiftly and often at height . 
 Distinctive markings , especially on its head , make the saxaul sparrow unlikely to be confused with any other bird . It is dull @-@ coloured , with plumage ranging between dull grey and warm sandy brown , varying between and within subspecies . Birds of the subspecies ammodendri are a sandy grey , while nigricans birds are similar but darker , and stoliczkae birds are warm brown or russet . Birds of the subspecies stoliczkae and those from the southwest of the range of ammodendri also differ from usual ammodendri birds in their lack of streaking on the rump and upper tail coverts . Birds in Mongolia have a larger and deeper bill and broad bluish streaks on their chest . 
 The male saxaul sparrow has bold markings , with a black stripe along the top of its head and another through its eye . It has black feathering , or a " bib " , on its throat and upper belly . By comparison to other sparrows this is thin on the throat , but wide on the breast . The male has a bright russet patch on the sides of its crown and nape . Its cheeks are pale grey or buff , and its underparts are whitish , tinged buff or grey on its sides . Its back is grey or warm brown , streaked variably with black . Its shoulders are more lightly streaked with black bars . The male 's thin tail is brown , with the edges and tips of feathers paler . Its median coverts are black with a white tip , while its other wing feathers are variably dark brown , cinnamon , or black , tipped buff or whitish and edged grey . The non @-@ breeding male differs in having slightly paler plumage . 
 The female is similar in some ways to the male , but paler and duller . It is sandy grey or brown , with a back patterned like that of the male , and white or whitish underparts . The head of the females of the subspecies ammodendri and nigricans is dingy grey with darker smudges on the forehead , behind its eyes , and on its throat . The female of the subspecies stoliczkae is buff @-@ brown with a white throat , a conspicuous pale supercilium , darker forehead , and lighter cheeks . The juvenile is similar to the female , differing in its lack of dark tinges on its throat and crown . In adults , moulting begins in July and ends in late August or early September . The post @-@ juvenile moult is complete , and occurs variously from June to August . 
 The saxaul sparrow 's vocalisations are little reported . Its common call is a chirp , transcribed as <unk> <unk> , softer and more melodious than that of the house sparrow . It gives a flight call transcribed as twerp , and a song described by Russian naturalist V. N. <unk> as " not loud , but pleasantly melodious with fairly diversified intonations " . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The saxaul sparrow was first described by English zoologist John Gould in a March 1872 instalment of The Birds of Asia , from a specimen collected near <unk> , now in southern Kazakhstan , by Russian naturalist Nikolai Severtzov . Severtzov had been planning to describe the species as Passer ammodendri for several years and had been distributing specimens among other naturalists . When natural history dealer Charles Dode escaped from the Paris Commune in 1871 with some of his collection , Gould obtained specimens from a set of rare birds Dode exhibited to the Zoological Society of London . Severtzov did not describe the species until 1873 , and some later writers preferred to attribute him , but Gould 's description takes priority over Severtzov 's . The saxaul sparrow 's species name refers to its desert habitat , coming from the name of the <unk> or sand acacia tree , which is in turn derived from the Ancient Greek <unk> ( <unk> , " sand " ) and <unk> ( dendron , " tree " ) . The English name saxaul sparrow refers to the saxaul plant , with which it is closely associated . The saxaul sparrow usually is classified in the genus Passer with the house sparrow and around twenty other species , although a genus <unk> was created for the saxaul sparrow by Nikolai Zarudny in 1890 . 
 The saxaul sparrow 's relations within the genus Passer are unclear , although with its black throat feathering it has usually been considered part of the " Palaearctic black @-@ bibbed sparrow " group related to the house sparrow . J. Denis Summers @-@ Smith considered that the Palaearctic Passer sparrows evolved about 25 @,@ 000 to 15 @,@ 000 years ago , during the last glacial period . During this time , sparrows would have been isolated in ice @-@ free refugia , such as a certain steppe region in Central Asia , where Summers @-@ Smith suggested the saxaul sparrow evolved . Genetic and fossil evidence suggest a much earlier origin for the Passer species , perhaps in the Miocene and Pliocene , as suggested by Luis Allende and colleagues in their 2001 phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA . This analysis also suggested that the saxaul sparrow may be an early offshoot or basal species in its genus , a relative of certain African sparrows such as the northern grey @-@ headed sparrow . If the saxaul sparrow is related to these species , either the saxaul sparrow formerly occurred in the deserts of Africa and Arabia , or each of the groups of Passer sparrows are of African origin . 
 Across its Central Asian distribution , the saxaul sparrow occurs in six probably disjunct areas , and is divided into at least three subspecies . The nominate subspecies Passer ammodendri ammodendri inhabits three of these areas , one in the Syr Darya basin of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan , and another to the south of Lake Balkhash and the north of Almaty , where it is only common in the valley of the Ili River . In a third area , sometimes recognised as a subspecies korejewi , ammodendri birds breed sporadically in parts of central Turkmenistan , Iran , and possibly Afghanistan , migrating to the south during the winter . The subspecies stoliczkae was named after Ferdinand Stoliczka in 1874 by Allan Octavian Hume , from specimens Stoliczka collected in Yarkand . This subspecies is separated from the other two subspecies by the Tian Shan mountains . It is found across a broad swath of China from Kashgar east to the far west of Inner Mongolia , through the areas around the Taklamakan Desert ( but probably not in the inhospitable desert itself ) , and through the east of Xinjiang , northern Gansu , and the fringes of southern Mongolia . In the extreme west of the Gobi Desert a disjunct population separated from the other stoliczkae birds by the <unk> <unk> Uul mountains occurs , which is sometimes separated as a subspecies <unk> . The subspecies nigricans , described by ornithologist L. S. <unk> in 1961 , is found in northern Xinjiang 's Manasi River valley . 
 = = Habitat = = 
 The saxaul sparrow is found in remote parts of Central Asia , where its distribution is believed to fall into six disjunct areas , although this is uncertain due to the scarcity of records . It is found in deserts , especially around rivers and oases . It is usually found around shrubs such as saxaul ( <unk> ) , poplar ( Populus ) , or tamarisk ( <unk> ) . Sometimes it occurs around settlements and grain fields , especially during the winter . It is not believed to be threatened , since it is reported as locally common across a wide range , and hence it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List . However , it seems to have lost large parts of its range to the intensification of agriculture and desertification caused by overgrazing . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Little is known of the saxaul sparrow 's behaviour , because of its remote range . It is shy in many areas , and spends much time hidden in foliage , but breeding birds in Mongolia were reported to be " quite confiding " . When not breeding , it is social , and can form flocks of up to fifty birds , sometimes associating with Eurasian tree , Spanish , and house sparrows . In some regions , it makes small local migrations . Towards the spring , saxaul sparrows form pairs within their flock , before dispersing in April . Seeds , especially those of the saxaul , are most of its diet , though it also eats insects , especially while breeding , most commonly weevils , grasshoppers , and caterpillars . It forages in trees and on the ground . In a study of insects fed to nestlings in the Ili River valley , it was found that beetles are predominant , with weevils and <unk> comprising 60 and 30 percent of the diet of nestlings , respectively . Because of its desert habitat and scarcity , it is not a pest of agriculture . Where water is not available , the saxaul sparrow may fly several times each day over long distances to drink . 
 The saxaul sparrow is less social than other sparrows while breeding , due to its dry habitat and its choices of nesting locations , holes in trees and earth banks . Isolated pairs are usual , though it sometimes breeds in small groups , with members of its own species as well as house and Eurasian tree sparrows . The breeding season is short , lasting from May to July , with most young raised in April and June . Unusually for a sparrow , it has not been recorded nesting openly in branches , though this may simply represent the lack of published records . Nests are often built in tree cavities , where they are sometimes placed close together . Other common nesting localities are earth banks and rocky slopes , and nests have been recorded on the nests of birds of prey , unused buildings , walls , and electricity pylons . Nests in man @-@ made structures are increasingly common , as large trees in the saxaul sparrow 's habitat are removed . Nests may be quite close to the ground , especially when they are built in trees . 
 The saxaul sparrow 's nests are untidy dome @-@ shaped constructions , with an entrance in the side or top . They are built of grasses , roots , and other plant materials , and are lined with feathers , fur , and soft plant material . The nest is mainly built by the female , though the male may actively take part in building . Typical clutches have five or six eggs , and two clutches a year are normal . Eggs are broad and ovular , slightly pointed at an end . They are glossy , coloured white and shaded with rusty grey or yellowish brown . In some clutches , one egg is noticeably paler than the others . Four eggs collected by Zarudny from Transcaspia had an average size of 1 @.@ 9 cm × 1 @.@ 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 75 in × 0 @.@ 55 in ) . Females play the main part in incubating eggs , and males can often be seen guarding the nests during incubation . Males and females share in feeding their young , which they do every 4 to 12 minutes . Young that have left their nest remain nearby until well after their moult , before departing for winter flocks , followed later by the adults .

 Aruba is a small island colony of 100 @,@ 000 people that is part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands , and has been under Dutch control since the 1630s . The island lies in the southern Caribbean Sea just to north of Venezuela , and is near to the Dutch colonies of Curaçao and Bonaire . The colony originally was part of an autonomous union with those two islands in what was known as the Netherlands Antilles , but Aruba seceded from that union in 1986 . The Netherlands continues to regulate all its foreign affairs . While the first Dutch <unk> delegation to the Olympics was sent during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki , Finland , the first uniquely Aruban delegation participated two years after the island 's secession from the Netherlands Antilles at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul , South Korea . Between then and the 2004 Athens Olympics , Aruba had sent a delegation to all five Summer Olympic games . The most substantial Aruban delegation was in 1988 , when it included eight athletes . This delegation included more women and encompassed more sports than any Aruban delegation since then ( including the Athens Olympics ) .

 The 373rd ( Croatian ) Infantry Division ( German : 373 . ( Kroatische ) Infanterie @-@ Division , Croatian : 373 . ( hrvatska ) <unk> divizija ) was a division of the German Army during World War II . It was formed in June 1943 using a brigade from the Home Guard of the Independent State of Croatia ( Croatian : Nezavisna Država Hrvatska , NDH ) with the addition of a German cadre . The division was commanded by Germans down to battalion and even company level in nearly all cases , and was commonly referred to as a " legionnaire division " . Originally formed with the intention of service on the Eastern Front , it was used instead for anti @-@ Partisan operations in the territory of the NDH until the end of the war . It fought mainly in the western areas of the NDH , and was involved in the attempt to kill or capture the leader of the Partisans , Josip Broz Tito , in May 1944 . Severely depleted by desertion , the division withdrew towards the Reich border in the early months of 1945 , eventually surrendering to the Partisans on 10 May 1945 near Brežice in modern @-@ day Slovenia .

 After the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 , Ante Pavelić , the leader of the newly created Axis puppet state the Independent State of Croatia ( NDH ) , offered Adolf Hitler volunteers to serve on the Eastern Front . This offer soon resulted in the formation and deployment of army , air force and naval detachments which , after being trained and equipped by Germany , were committed to fighting the Red Army . The largest element was the 369th Croatian Reinforced Infantry Regiment , which was part of the 100th Jäger Division , but was decimated at Stalingrad in January 1943 . The Croatian forces performed creditably on the Eastern Front , and the Germans continued to support the development of NDH forces with the aim of raising several divisions to serve there . Due to the lack of trained leaders and staff , these divisions were raised using a German cadre . 
 The 373rd ( Croatian ) Infantry Division was assembled and trained in Stockerau and Döllersheim , Austria , commencing from the end of January 1943 as the second Croatian division raised for service in the Wehrmacht , following its sister formation , the 369th ( Croatian ) Infantry Division . It was built around a cadre of 3 @,@ 500 German troops , and 8 @,@ 500 soldiers of the 7th Mountain Brigade of the Croatian Home Guard , the regular army of the NDH . It was established with two infantry regiments of three battalions each . Each regiment was allocated the manpower from two of the four battalions of the 7th Mountain Brigade . It was formed under the command of Generalmajor ( Brigadier ) Emil Zellner , with the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross recipient Oberst ( Colonel ) Alois Windisch commanding the 383rd ( Croatian ) Grenadier Regiment and Oberst <unk> commanding the 384th ( Croatian ) Grenadier Regiment . All battalions were commanded by Germans except for the reconnaissance battalion , which was commanded by a Croat officer , Major <unk> . The Croatian divisions that served in the Wehrmacht were commonly known as " legionnaire divisions " . 
 Although originally intended for use on the Eastern Front , the division did not deploy there and returned to the NDH in May 1943 due to the need to combat the communist @-@ led Partisans in the territory of the NDH . The division left its training area in Austria over the period 1 – 12 May 1943 , travelling by train via the route Vienna – Graz – Marburg – Zagreb . It was known as the " Tiger Division " ( Croatian : Tigar <unk> ) , and was subordinated to the Croatia Command ( German : Befehlshaber Kroatien ) of General der Infanterie ( Lieutenant General ) Rudolf Lüters .

 = = = = Initial tasks = = = = 
 The first task of the division was to secure the area north and northwest of Mostar , which contained important bauxite reserves needed for the German war effort . The divisional headquarters was established in Bugojno with the regimental headquarters of the 383rd at Lise , and the 384th at Travnik . At the end of May , one battalion ( III / 383 ) and supporting artillery were deployed to Mostar to replace Italian forces . For the first few weeks the division had only minor contacts with Partisan forces , but by mid @-@ June the division began sending out strong Jagdkommandos , lightly armed and mobile " hunter teams " of company or battalion strength , to break up and harass Partisans operating in the divisional area of responsibility . In early July , a search and destroy operation was conducted west of the Kupres – Bugojno – Jajce road , during which local Chetniks units began cooperating with the division . On 5 July , <unk> summoned the inhabitants of a village and shot six captured Partisans in front of them . The division lost 23 killed during this operation . Following the conclusion of this sweep , the division moved north , and its headquarters redeployed to Prijedor . 
 Throughout July and August 1943 the division patrolled constantly and fought minor engagements in its area of responsibility . On 5 August 1943 , Generalleutnant ( Major General ) Eduard Aldrian became divisional commander replacing Zellner , who was transferred to the Army Headquarters officers ' reserve pool ( German : Oberkommando des Heeres Führerreserve ) . On 16 August , Oberstleutnant ( Lieutenant Colonel ) <unk> replaced Windisch as commander of the 383rd Regiment , and the division was placed under the command of the 2nd Panzer Army , which had been redeployed to the Balkans from the Eastern Front . Over the period 18 – 22 August , 102 Croat and Bosnian Muslim soldiers deserted , ten of whom were later arrested . There were a range of factors encouraging desertion , including Partisan propaganda and infiltration , the influence of the Croatian Peasant Party , and reverses suffered by the Germans in North Africa and at Stalingrad and elsewhere on the Eastern Front . 
 = = = = Combat intensifies = = = = 
 In late August and early September 1943 , the division redeployed again , this time to Bihać , relieving the 114th Jäger Division which redeployed to the Adriatic coast . The move was difficult , with several significant ambushes resulting in numerous casualties and the loss of several vehicles and guns . 
 In September , it was placed under the command of the newly formed XV Mountain Corps led by Lüters . That month , the division concluded a collaboration agreement with the 260 @-@ strong Chetnik detachment of Mane <unk> , who was in control of an area which included parts of both western Bosnia and Lika . The division utilised the Chetniks to protect railway lines and key industries in their area , as well as for scouting against the Partisans and attacks on the rear of Partisan formations . Desertions worsened particularly after the capitulation of Italy in early September 1943 . For example , during October 1943 , 334 men deserted from the division . It handled thousands of Italian prisoners in the aftermath of the surrender , feeding them and marching them under guard towards the Reich . 
 On 20 October 1943 , the Germans formally confirmed that the division would not be utilised outside the NDH . In the second half of October 1943 , Partisan forces surrounded the Croatian Home Guard garrison of Prijedor . The 383rd Regiment relieved the garrison and conducted clearing operations around the town until heavy snowfalls in the first week in November . On 4 December , Oberstleutnant Hühnewaldt replaced <unk> as the commander of the regiment . 
 = = = = Operations Panther and Ristow = = = = 
 Between 10 and 24 December 1943 , the division , along with the 371st Infantry Division and the 1st Cossack Division , participated in Operation Panther . The aim of the operation was to encircle Partisan forces located within the Kostajnica forest and the area north of Bosanski Novi . The operation achieved little , and was immediately followed by Operation Ristow . The objective of this operation was to clear the area south of the Sana river between Bosanski Novi and Prijedor . The objective of the operation was the destruction of elements of the Partisan 7th Banija Division , which intelligence indicated were planning to establish winter quarters in the vicinity of <unk> village , with the river Japra protecting their rear . The division committed the 383rd Infantry Regiment , reinforced by three tanks of the 202nd Panzer Battalion , and supported by the guns of I. Battalion , 373rd Artillery Regiment . The plan involved a three @-@ day operation commencing on 24 December . Following up reconnaissance by the Croatian 3rd Mountain Brigade , the objective of the first day was to thrust 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) eastward from Bosanski Novi to secure heights east of the Japra , and this was achieved against light resistance . 
 The following day saw heavy fighting before the German force secured their objectives , suffering ten wounded in the process . After mopping up on 26 December , orders were issued for I. Battalion to continue the advance south of the Sana towards the village of <unk> , while II . Battalion was ordered to cross the Sana on rafts and continue the advance on the northern side of the river . On the morning of 27 December , I. Battalion successfully advanced to a point about 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) west of Prijedor , and occupied <unk> . Advancing further east , I. Battalion lost formation and suffered heavy attacks from Partisan forces who also infiltrated between the companies and attacked their flanks and rear . The entire force , less two companies and the tanks which remained north of the river , consolidated on heights south of the Sana , and throughout the night fought off several large Partisan assaults which were supported by heavy mortar fire . On 28 December , the German force fought its way to the south bank of the Sana , and evacuated its casualties across the river on rafts . The main body then fought its way east to Prijedor with covering fire provided by the two companies and tanks remaining on the northern bank , with the majority arriving on 29 December . Operation Ristow was very costly for the division , with I. Battalion alone suffering 100 casualties , mainly from mortar fire on the night of 27 / 28 December . Information from the local population indicated that the Partisans lost at least 76 dead during the operation .

 = = = = Battle of Banja Luka = = = = 
 In late December 1943 , Hühnewaldt was tasked with the defence of Banja Luka , the second largest city in Bosnia , which had been under Partisan pressure for several days . The headquarters of XV Mountain Corps was in Banja Luka , along with the divisional replacement battalion , divisional support troops , some police and a few tanks . Elements of the 4th Jäger Brigade of the Croatian Home Guard were also in the city . On 31 December , Hühnewaldt deployed I / 383 to Banja Luka to further bolster the defences . At 23 : 00 that day , a heavy artillery and mortar bombardment started , followed by a Partisan attack that quickly overran the Home Guard outposts and engaged the divisional units in heavy fighting . At first light on New Year 's Day , I / 383 counterattacked , recapturing the crucial power station . That evening the Partisans renewed their assault , overrunning the hospital and massacring the German sick and wounded , and capturing the railway station . By this point the defenders were concentrated in two blocks of the town centre and the Partisans were only 100 metres ( 330 ft ) away . A desperate but unsuccessful counterattack was mounted , and the city appeared lost when the force was relieved by the <unk> Panzergrenadier Lehr Regiment . The Partisans quickly withdrew and the Ustaše Militia and Sicherheitsdienst ( Security Police ) subsequently executed all armed personnel captured in the city . Those killed during the battle included 67 Germans , 150 Croatian Home Guard and between 300 and 350 Partisans . 
 Following the battle , the division cleared and secured the area around Banja Luka , and in February 1944 Hühnewaldt was replaced as commander of the 383rd Regiment by Major Ristow of I / 383 . At the end of March , most of the 383rd Regiment was deployed to Knin with responsibility for the road between Knin and Bihać , with the regimental commander designated as the commander of the garrison . In the latter task , it was assisted by the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen . From 7 to 16 May 1944 , the division participated in Operation Morgenstern ( Morning Star ) in the Krbavsko Polje region west and southwest of Bihać , along with elements of its sister formation , the 392nd ( Croatian ) Infantry Division , the 92nd Motorised Regiment , the 1st Jäger Regiment of the Panzergrenadier Division Brandenburg , and <unk> units . The operation was a significant success , killing 438 Partisans and capturing 56 , along with large quantities of arms , ammunition , vehicles and supplies . 
 = = = = Operation Rösselsprung = = = = 
 The division formed a significant part of the ground force used by XV Mountain Corps in Operation Rösselsprung , which was launched on 25 May 1944 , with the objectives of killing or capturing the Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito , and destroying his headquarters at Drvar . The division was responsible for two of the nine coordinated thrusts converging on the Partisan stronghold in the Drvar @-@ Bosanski Petrovac area . The first thrust consisted of the 384th ( Croatian ) Infantry Regiment , referred to as Kampfgruppe Willam after its commander . The 384th Regiment group was to advance east at 5 am on 25 May from the village of Srb towards Drvar . Kampfgruppe Willam had the primary responsibility for relieving then taking command of 500th SS Parachute Battalion who would land by parachute and glider in Drvar on 25 May , and the regiment was then to attack in the direction of Bosanski Petrovac . The second thrust consisted of a battalion group from the division , which was to set out at 5 am on 25 May from Lapac and drive east through Kulen Vakuf to capture the crossroads at Vrtoče . If necessary , they were then to advance north @-@ west towards Bihać to open the road . 
 Throughout 25 May , the ground forces of XV Mountain Corps were not able to advance as quickly as expected . There was unexpected resistance from strong Partisan forces along their axes of advance , and there was very poor communication between the various elements which resulted in lack of coordination of their movements . They were also subjected to several Allied air attacks . In the meantime , Tito and his key staff escaped to the south and were flown to Italy . Kampfgruppe Willam was unable to overcome the resistance of the 2nd Lika Brigade , and to force its way through to Drvar until the paratroopers had been relieved around midday on 26 May by a stronger column attacking from the direction of Bihać . On 29 May the battalion group from the division attacked strong Partisan positions east , north and northwest of Prekaja , but the attack was held up by a lack of ammunition . The attack was renewed on 31 May after new orders had been issued , with the division occupying the Prekaja area and capturing two Partisan tanks . Operation Rösselsprung was a failure as Tito and his principal headquarters staff escaped . 
 = = = Final months = = = 
 After Rösselsprung , the division was deployed along the Una valley , with the exception of two battalions of the 383rd Regiment in the Prijedor – Ljubija area , and two battalions of the 384th Regiment in Drvar and Petrovac . In Drvar and Petrovac , the 384th Regiment was reinforced by the 1st Jäger Home Guard Regiment , and in the Prijedor – Ljubija area , the 383rd Regiment was reinforced by the 4th Jäger Home Guard Brigade . The 2nd Jäger Home Guard Brigade and 9th Ustaša Brigade were deployed in garrisons and fortifications protecting the communication routes through the Una valley . All garrisons were reinforced with local Chetnik and Ustaša Militia detachments , and all of these forces were under divisional command . 
 On 1 and 2 August , the Petrovac garrison , consisting of the 2nd Battalion of the 384th Regiment under Major Schreiber , repelled attacks by the Partisan 6th and 13th Krajina Brigades . The supporting Home Guard forces surrendered after the first shots were fired , but the Chetnik detachment provided a stiff defense , which allowed the garrison to hold Petrovac . 
 During the summer 1944 , the communications in the division 's area of responsibility were under constant Partisan attacks . The attacks intensified in early September , during the Operation <unk> . It coincided with the German transportation of troops and military material to Serbia on the eve of Belgrade Operation . In one of these <unk> , on 1 September , Kozara Partisan Detachment attacked and damaged the train carrying 2nd Company of the 202nd Tank Battalion between Bosanski Novi and <unk> . 
 On 6 September Partisan 4th Division attacked the Prijedor garrison , The main force of the garrison was the 7th Jäger Home Guard Regiment of the 4th Brigade , and it was reinforced with some Ustaša and Chetnik units . The Home Guard units were affected with intense demoralization , and offered little resistance . In the morning on 7 September Prijedor was liberated , and a 1 @,@ 000 strong mixed formation from the garrison headed towards Ljubija . Ljubija was defended by 1st Battalion of the 383rd Regiment of the 373rd Division , 4th and 6th Battalion of the 8th Ustaša Brigade , and Ustaša Militia , with total strength of around 2 @,@ 000 men . They were reinforced with the mixed Home Guard , Ustaša and Chetnik group from Prijedor . With the fall of Prijedor , Ljubija remained isolated , and when the Partisan attack had spread to Ljubija , the German Battalion Commander , Captain <unk> , decided to evacuate Ljubija , and to try to reach Bosanski Novi with his 3 @,@ 000 strong mixed group , moving aside of the roads . Under constant Partisan heavy fire , the movement became disorganized and chaotic . Captain <unk> suffered a nervous breakdown , and the command <unk> Captain <unk> . Only a smaller part of the group reached Bosanski Novi . The German Battalion suffered losses of up to 100 men . The auxiliary troops did much worse : the Partisans in these two days in Prijedor and Ljubija killed 3 @,@ 337 and captured 552 , mostly Home Guard , Ustaša and Chetnik soldiers . 
 The Una valley was exposed to the pressure of both the 4th from the west , and the 5th Partisan Corps from the east . In September 1944 , the 4th Partisan Corps attacked Cazin and Sunja . Cazin was defended with the 5th Ustaša Battalion , backing on the strong formations of the 373rd Division in the nearby <unk> , Krupa and Bihać . In spite of the proximity of the strong forces , the Partisans on 13 September succeeded to destroy the Ustaša battalion , killing 273 and capturing 276 . The Cazin garrison was raided by 1st Kordun and 2nd <unk> Brigade , while the 2nd Kordun Brigade blocked the relieve attempts . After the Partisan retreat , the new garrison was established in Cazin , this time reinforced with the elements of the 373rd Division . 
 On 7 November , the 4th Corps renewed the attack on Cazin with mostly the same units . The only difference was that this time the 1st <unk> Brigade instead of 2nd Kordun Brigade was charged with the task of closing the road Bihać @-@ <unk> @-@ Cazin . The fighting lasted for two days , and was concluded with the utmost success for the Partisans , and almost total destruction of the garrison . Germans and Ustaše suffered losses of 481 killed ( 4 officers and 477 NCOs ) , 267 captured ( 1 officer and 266 NCOs and soldiers ) . The reinforced company of the 373rd Division in Cazin was completely destroyed , except two men who had hidden themselves at the friendly inclined civilians . 
 In the autumn of 1944 , the division absorbed the 2nd Jäger Brigade of the Croatian Home Guard as its third regiment , renamed the 385th ( Croatian ) Infantry Regiment . On 20 October , Oberst der Reserves Karl Hermann replaced Aldrian , and was in turn replaced by Oberst Hans Gravenstein on 14 November . On 6 December 1944 , the division participated in the defence of Knin against the Partisans , where it suffered serious losses . In January 1945 , Gravenstein was promoted to Generalmajor , and withdrew the survivors of the division to the northwest towards Bihać . During this withdrawal , the division assisted the 6 @,@ 000 – 7 @,@ 000 Chetniks of Momčilo Đujić that had fought alongside them at Knin and accompanied them towards Bihać . During an attack of the 35th Lika Division later that month , a large number of Croats from the division deserted to join the Partisans . This trend continued , with a further two companies of Croat soldiers deserting . 
 The division saw action against the Partisans until the end of the war . By April 1945 , a large part of its Croatian manpower had been lost or released , with the Croatian component reduced to between 2 @,@ 000 and 3 @,@ 000 soldiers . During the last few months of the war , it fought in northern Dalmatia and parts of Lika and Kordun and later in Banija . When the Partisans launched their spring offensive on 20 March 1945 , it fought the Partisan 2nd Army as it advanced on Zagreb . The division withdrew from Gospić via Donji Lapac , Bosanska Krupa , Bosanski Novi and Kostajnica where most of its remaining Croatian soldiers were separated out from the German elements and probably dispersed . The remainder continued its withdrawal via Sunja , Sisak and Zagreb to Brežice in modern @-@ day Slovenia , where it surrendered to the Partisans at the village of Raka on 10 May 1945 , and the remaining Croat soldiers left the division . The division 's disarmed German troops were allowed to travel towards Germany for several days before becoming prisoners of war of the Partisans . Gravenstein was tried by the Yugoslav authorities in 1947 and hanged .

 = Dick Turpin = 
 Richard " Dick " Turpin ( bapt . 1705 – 7 April 1739 ) was an English highwayman whose exploits were romanticised following his execution in York for horse theft . Turpin may have followed his father 's trade as a butcher early in life , but , by the early 1730s , he had joined a gang of deer thieves and , later , became a poacher , burglar , horse thief and killer . He is also known for a fictional 200 @-@ mile ( 320 km ) overnight ride from London to York on his horse Black Bess , a story that was made famous by the Victorian novelist William Harrison Ainsworth almost 100 years after Turpin 's death . 
 Turpin 's involvement in the crime for which he is most closely associated — highway robbery — followed the arrest of the other members of his gang in 1735 . He then disappeared from public view towards the end of that year , only to resurface in 1737 with two new accomplices , one of whom he may have accidentally shot and killed . Turpin fled from the scene and shortly afterwards killed a man who attempted his capture . Later that year , he moved to Yorkshire and assumed the alias of John Palmer . While he was staying at an inn , local magistrates became suspicious of " Palmer " and made enquiries as to how he funded his lifestyle . Suspected of being a horse thief , " Palmer " was imprisoned in York Castle , to be tried at the next assizes . Turpin 's true identity was revealed by a letter he wrote to his brother @-@ in @-@ law from his prison cell , which fell into the hands of the authorities . On 22 March 1739 , Turpin was found guilty on two charges of horse theft and sentenced to death ; he was executed on 7 April 1739 . 
 Turpin became the subject of legend after his execution , romanticised as dashing and heroic in English ballads and popular theatre of the 18th and 19th centuries and in film and television of the 20th century . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Richard " Dick " Turpin was born at the Blue Bell Inn ( later the Rose and Crown ) in Hempstead , Essex , the fifth of six children to John Turpin and Mary Elizabeth Parmenter . He was baptised on 21 September 1705 , in the same parish where his parents had been married more than ten years earlier . 
 Turpin 's father was a butcher and inn @-@ keeper . Several stories suggest that Dick Turpin may have followed his father into these trades ; one hints that as a teenager he was apprenticed to a butcher in the village of Whitechapel , while another proposes that he ran his own butcher 's shop in Thaxted . Testimony from his trial in 1739 suggests that he had a rudimentary education and , although no records survive of the date of the union , that in about 1725 he married Elizabeth Millington . Following his apprenticeship they moved north to Buckhurst Hill , Essex ( on the modern boundary of north east London ) , where Turpin opened a butcher 's shop . 
 = = Essex gang = = 
 Turpin most likely became involved with the Essex gang of deer thieves in the early 1730s . Deer poaching had long been endemic in the Royal Forest of Waltham , and in 1723 the Black Act ( so called because it outlawed the blackening or disguising of faces while in the forests ) was enacted to deal with such problems . Deer stealing was a domestic offence that was judged not in civil courts , but before Justices of the peace ; it was not until 1737 that the more severe penalty of seven years ' transportation was introduced . However , in 1731 seven <unk> became so concerned by the increase in activity that they signed an affidavit which demonstrated their worries . The statement was lodged with Thomas Pelham @-@ Holles , 1st Duke of Newcastle , who responded by offering a £ 10 reward to anyone who helped identify the thieves , plus a pardon for those thieves who gave up their colleagues . Following a series of nasty incidents , including the threatened murder of a keeper and his family , in 1733 the government increased the reward to £ 50 ( about £ 7 @,@ 100 as of 2016 ) . 
 The Essex gang ( sometimes called the Gregory Gang ) , which included Samuel Gregory , his brothers Jeremiah and Jasper , Joseph Rose , Mary Brazier ( the gang 's fence ) , John Jones , Thomas Rowden and a young John Wheeler , needed contacts to help them to dispose of the deer . Turpin , a young butcher who traded in the area , almost certainly became involved with their activities . By 1733 the changing fortunes of the gang may have prompted him to leave the butchery trade , and he became the landlord of a public house , most likely the Rose and Crown at Clay Hill . Although there is no evidence to suggest that Turpin was directly involved in the thefts , by summer 1734 he was a close associate of the gang , which may indicate that he had been known to them for some time . 
 By October 1734 several in the gang had either been captured or had fled , and the remaining members moved away from poaching , raiding the home of a chandler and grocer named Peter Split , at Woodford . Although the identities of the perpetrators are unknown , Turpin may have been involved . Two nights later they struck again , at the Woodford home of a gentleman named Richard Woolridge , a <unk> of Small Arms in the Office of Ordnance at the Tower of London . In December Jasper and Samuel Gregory , John Jones , and John Wheeler , attacked the home of John Gladwin ( a <unk> ) and John Shockley , in Chingford . On 19 December Turpin and five other men raided the home of Ambrose Skinner , a 73 @-@ year @-@ old farmer from Barking , leaving with an estimated £ 300 . 
 Two days later , the gang — minus Turpin — attacked the home of a Keeper , William Mason , at Epping Forest . During the robbery Mason 's servant managed to escape , and returned about an hour later with several neighbours , by which time the house was ransacked and the thieves long gone . On 11 January 1735 the gang raided the Charlton home of a Mr. Saunders . For the robbery of a gentleman named Sheldon , one week later at Croydon , Turpin arrived masked and armed with pistols , with four other members of the gang . In the same month two men , possibly from the same gang , raided the home of a Reverend <unk> . The clergyman was absent but the two cut his manservant around the face " in a barbarous manner " . Another brutal attack occurred on 1 February 1735 at Loughton : 
 On Saturday night last , about seven o 'clock , five rogues entered the house of the Widow Shelley at Loughton in Essex , having pistols & c. and threatened to murder the old lady , if she would not tell them where her money lay , which she obstinately refusing for some time , they threatened to lay her across the fire , if she did not instantly tell them , which she would not do . But her son being in the room , and threatened to be murdered , cried out , he would tell them , if they would not murder his mother , and did , whereupon they went upstairs , and took near £ 100 , a silver tankard , and other plate , and all manner of household goods . They afterwards went into the cellar and drank several bottles of ale and wine , and broiled some meat , ate the relicts of a fillet of veal & c . While they were doing this , two of their gang went to Mr <unk> , a farmer 's , who rents one end of the widow 's house , and robbed him of above £ 20 and then they all went off , taking two of the farmer 's horses , to carry off their luggage , the horses were found on Sunday the following morning in Old Street , and stayed about three hours in the house . 
 The gang lived in or around London . For a time Turpin stayed at Whitechapel , before moving to Millbank . On 4 February 1735 he met John Fielder , Samuel Gregory , Joseph Rose , and John Wheeler , at an inn along The Broadway in London . They planned to rob the house of Joseph Lawrence , a farmer at <unk> Farm in Edgware . Late that afternoon , after stopping twice along the way for food and drink , they captured a shepherd boy and burst into the house , armed with pistols . They bound the two maidservants , and brutally attacked the 70 @-@ year @-@ old farmer . They pulled his breeches around his ankles , and dragged him around the house , but Lawrence refused to reveal the whereabouts of his money . Turpin beat Lawrence 's bare buttocks with his pistols , badly bruising him , and other members of the gang beat him around the head with their pistols . They emptied a kettle of water over his head , forced him to sit bare @-@ <unk> on the fire , and pulled him around the house by his nose , and hair . Gregory took one of the maidservants upstairs and raped her . For their trouble , the gang escaped with a haul of less than £ 30 . 
 Three days later Turpin , accompanied by the same men along with William Saunders and Humphrey Walker , brutally raided a farm in Marylebone . The attack netted the gang just under £ 90 . The next day the Duke of Newcastle offered a reward of £ 50 in exchange for information leading to the conviction of the " several persons " involved in the two Woodford robberies , and the robberies of the widow Shelley and Reverend <unk> . On 11 February Fielder , Saunders , and Wheeler , were apprehended . Two accounts of their capture exist . One claims that on their way to rob the Lawrence household the gang had stopped at an alehouse in Edgware , and that on 11 February , while out walking , the owner noticed a group of horses outside an alehouse in Bloomsbury . He recognised these horses as those used by the same group of men who had stopped at his alehouse before the Lawrence attack , and called for the parish constable . Another account claims that two of the gang were spotted by a servant of Joseph Lawrence . Regardless , the three , who were drinking with a woman ( possibly Mary Brazier ) were promptly arrested and committed to prison . Wheeler , who may have been as young as 15 , quickly betrayed his colleagues , and descriptions of those yet to be captured were circulated in the press . In the London Gazette Turpin was described as " Richard Turpin , a butcher by trade , is a tall fresh coloured man , very much marked with the small pox , about 26 years of age , about five feet nine inches high , lived some time ago in Whitechapel and did lately lodge somewhere about Millbank , Westminster , wears a blue grey coat and a natural wig " . 
 = = Breakup of the Essex gang = = 
 Once Wheeler 's confession became apparent , the other members of the gang fled their usual haunts . Turpin informed Gregory and the others of Wheeler 's capture , and left Westminster . On 15 February 1735 , while Wheeler was busy confessing to the authorities , " three or four men " ( most likely Samuel Gregory , Herbert Haines , Turpin , and possibly Thomas Rowden ) robbed the house of a Mrs St. John at Chingford . On the following day Turpin ( and Rowden , if present ) parted company with Gregory and Haines , and headed for Hempstead to see his family . Gregory and Haines may have gone looking for Turpin , because on 17 February they stopped at an alehouse in Debden and ordered a shoulder of mutton , intending to stay for the night . However , a man named Palmer recognised them , and called for the parish constable . A fracas ensued , during which the two thieves escaped . They rejoined Turpin , and along with Jones and Rowden may have travelled to Gravesend before returning to Woodford . Another robbery was reported at Woodford toward the end of February — possibly by Gregory and his cohorts — but with most avenues of escape cut off , and with the authorities hunting them down , the remaining members of the Essex gang kept their heads down and remained under cover , probably in Epping Forest . 
 Six days after the arrest of Fielder , Saunders , and Wheeler , just as Turpin and his associates were returning from Gravesend , Rose , Brazier , and Walker were captured at a chandler 's shop in Westminster , while drinking punch . Fielder , Rose , Saunders and Walker were tried at the Middlesex General Session between 26 February and 1 March 1735 . Turpin and Gregory were also named on the indictments for burglary . Walker died while still in Newgate Prison , but the remaining three were hanged at Tyburn gallows on 10 March , before their bodies were hung to rot in gibbets on Edgware Road . Walker 's body was hung in chains . Two days before the hanging , a report of " four suspicious men " being driven away from an alehouse at East Sheen appeared in a newspaper , and was likely describing Gregory and his companions , but the remaining members of the Essex gang were not reported again until 30 March , when three of them ( unsuccessfully ) tried to steal a horse from a servant of the Earl of Suffolk . Turpin was present with four of the gang at another robbery , reported on 8 March . Jasper Gregory meanwhile was captured , and then executed late in March . His brothers were arrested on 9 April in Rake , West Sussex , after a struggle during which Samuel lost the tip of his nose to a sword , and Jeremy was shot in the leg . He died in Winchester gaol ; Samuel was tried in May , and executed on 4 June . His body was later moved , to hang in chains alongside those of his colleagues at Edgware . Mary Brazier was transported to the Thirteen Colonies . Herbert Haines was captured on 13 April , and executed in August . John Wheeler , who had been instrumental in proving the cases against his former colleagues , and who was freed , died at Hackney in January 1738 . The reason for his death is not recorded , but is assumed to be natural causes . 
 = = Highwayman = = 
 With the Essex gang now smashed by the authorities , Turpin turned instead to the crime he became most noted for — highway robbery . Although he may have been involved in earlier highway robberies on 10 and 12 April , he was first identified as a suspect in one event on 10 July , as " Turpin the butcher " , along with Thomas Rowden , " the <unk> " . Several days later the two struck at Epping Forest , depriving a man from Southwark of his belongings . With a further bounty of £ 100 on their heads they continued their activities through the latter half of 1735 . In August they robbed five people accompanying a coach on Barnes Common , and shortly after that they attacked another coach party , between Putney and Kingston Hill . On 20 August the pair relieved a Mr Godfrey of six guineas and a pocket book , on Hounslow Heath . Fearing capture , they moved on to Blackheath in Hertfordshire , and then back to London . On 5 December the two were seen near Winchester , but in late December , following the capture of John Jones , they separated . Rowden had previously been convicted of counterfeiting , and in July 1736 he was convicted of passing counterfeit coin , under the alias Daniel Crispe . Crispe 's true name was eventually discovered and he was transported in June 1738 . Jones also suffered transportation , to the Thirteen Colonies . 
 Little is known of Turpin 's movements during 1736 . He may have travelled to Holland , as various sightings were reported there , but he may also have assumed an alias and disappeared from public view . In February 1737 though , he spent the night at <unk> , with his wife , her maid and a man called Robert Nott . Turpin arranged the meeting by letter , which was intercepted by the authorities . While Turpin eluded his enemies , making his escape to Cambridge , the others were arrested on charges of " violent suspicion of being dangerous rogues and robbing upon the highway " . They were imprisoned at Hertford gaol , although the women were later acquitted ( Nott was released at the next Assize ) . Although one report late in March suggests , unusually , that Turpin alone robbed a company of <unk> , in the same month he was reported to be working alongside two other highwaymen , Matthew King ( then , and since , incorrectly identified as Tom King ) , and Stephen Potter . The trio were responsible for a string of robberies between March and April 1737 , which ended suddenly in an incident at Whitechapel , after King ( or Turpin , depending upon which report is read ) had stolen a horse near Waltham Forest . Its owner , Joseph Major , reported the theft to Richard Bayes , landlord of the Green Man public house at Leytonstone . Bayes ( who later wrote a biography of Turpin ) , tracked the horse to the Red Lion at Whitechapel . Major identified the animal , but as it was late evening and the horses had not yet been collected by their " owners " , they elected to hold a vigil . John King ( Matthew King 's brother ) arrived late that night , and was quickly apprehended by the party , which included the local constable . John King told him the whereabouts of Matthew King , who was waiting nearby . During the resulting mêlée , King was wounded by gunfire , and died on 19 May . Potter was later caught , but at his trial was released for lack of evidence against him . 
 = = Fatal shooting = = 
 Bayes ' statement regarding the death of Matthew King may have been heavily embellished . Several reports , including Turpin 's own account , offer different versions of what actually happened on that night early in May 1737 ; early reports claimed that Turpin had shot King , however by the following month the same newspapers retracted this claim , and stated that Bayes had fired the fatal shot . The shooting of King , however , preceded an event that changed Turpin 's life completely . He escaped to a hideaway in Epping Forest , where he was seen by Thomas Morris , a servant of one of the Forest 's Keepers . Turpin shot and killed Morris on 4 May with a carbine when , armed with pistols , Morris attempted to capture him . The shooting was reported in The Gentleman 's Magazine : 
 It having been represented to the King , that Richard Turpin did on Wednesday the 4th of May last , barbarously murder Thomas Morris , Servant to Henry Tomson , one of the Keepers of Epping @-@ Forest , and commit other notorious Felonies and Robberies near London , his Majesty is pleased to promise his most gracious Pardon to any of his Accomplices , and a Reward of <unk> to any Person or Persons that shall discover him , so as he may be apprehended and convicted . Turpin was born at <unk> in Essex , is about Thirty , by Trade a Butcher , about 5 Feet 9 Inches high , brown Complexion , very much mark 'd with the Small Pox , his Cheek @-@ bones broad , his Face thinner towards the Bottom , his Visage short , pretty upright , and broad about the Shoulders . 
 Several newspapers suggested that on 6 and 7 May , he committed two highway robberies near Epping . Turpin may also have lost his mount ; on 7 May an Elizabeth King attempted to secure two horses left by Matthew King , at an inn called the Red Lion . The horses were suspected as belonging to " highwaymen " and King was arrested for questioning , but was later released without charge . Morris 's killing unleashed a flood of Turpin reports , and a reward of £ 200 was offered for his capture . 
 = = As John Palmer = = 
 Sometime around June 1737 Turpin boarded at the Ferry Inn at Brough , under the alias of John Palmer ( or <unk> ) . Travelling across the River Humber between the historic counties of the East Riding of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire , he posed as a horse trader , and often hunted alongside local gentlemen . On 2 October 1738 Turpin shot another man 's game cock in the street . While being rebuked by John Robinson , he then threatened to shoot him also . Three East Riding justices ( JP ) , George Crowle ( Member of Parliament for Hull ) , Hugh Bethell , and Marmaduke Constable , travelled to Brough and took written depositions about the incident . They threatened to bind him over , but Turpin refused to pay the required surety , and was committed to the House of Correction at Beverley . Turpin was escorted to Beverley by the parish constable , Carey Gill . <unk> , he made no attempt at escape ; Barlow ( 1973 ) surmises that at this point in his life , Turpin may have been wallowing in self @-@ pity , depressed that his life had thus far been a failure . 
 Robert Appleton , Clerk of the Peace for the East Riding , and the man whose account details the above incident , later reported that the three JPs made enquiries as to how " Palmer " had made his money , suspecting that his lifestyle was funded by criminal activities . Turpin claimed that he was a butcher who had fallen into debt , and that he had <unk> from his home in Long Sutton , Lincolnshire . When contacted , the JP at Long Sutton ( a Mr Delamere ) confirmed that John Palmer had lived there for about nine months , but that he was suspected of stealing sheep , and had escaped the custody of the local constable . Delamere also suspected that Palmer was a horse @-@ thief and had taken several depositions supporting his view , and told the three JPs that he would prefer him to be detained . The three JPs now presumed that the case was too serious for Palmer to remain at Beverley House of Correction , and demanded sureties for his appearance at York Assizes . Turpin refused , and so on 16 October he was transferred to York Castle in handcuffs . 
 Horse theft became a capital offence in 1545 , punishable by death . During the 17th and 18th centuries , crimes in violation of property rights were some of the most severely punished ; most of the 200 capital statutes were property offences . Robbery combined with violence was " the sort of offence , second only to premeditated murder ( a relatively uncommon crime ) , most likely to be prosecuted and punished to [ the law 's ] utmost rigour " . Turpin had stolen several horses while operating under the pseudonym of Palmer . In July 1737 he stole a horse from Pinchbeck in Lincolnshire , and took it to visit his father at Hempstead . When Turpin returned to Brough ( stealing three horses along the way ) he left the gelding with his father . The identity of John Turpin 's son was well known , and the horse 's identity was soon discovered . On 12 September 1738 therefore , John Turpin was committed to gaol in Essex on charges of horse theft , but following his help in preventing a jailbreak , the charges were dropped on 5 March 1739 . About a month after " Palmer " had been moved to York Castle , Thomas Creasy , the owner of the three horses stolen by Turpin , managed to track them down and recover them , and it was for these thefts that he was eventually tried . 
 From his cell , Turpin wrote to his brother @-@ in @-@ law , <unk> Rivernall , who also lived at Hempstead . Rivernall was married to Turpin 's sister , Dorothy . The letter was kept at the local post office , but seeing the York post stamp Rivernall refused to pay the delivery charge , claiming that he " had no correspondent at York " . Rivernall may not have wanted to pay the charge for the letter , or he may have wished to distance himself from Turpin 's affairs , and so the letter was moved to the post office at Saffron Walden where James Smith , who had taught Turpin how to write while the latter was at school , recognised the handwriting . He alerted JP Thomas <unk> , who paid the postage and opened the letter . Smith travelled to York Castle and on 23 February identified Palmer as Turpin . He received the £ 200 ( about £ 29 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) reward originally offered by the Duke of Newcastle following Turpin 's murder of Thomas Morris . 
 = = Trial = = 
 Although there was some question as to where the trial should be held — the Duke of Newcastle wanted him tried in London — Turpin was tried at York Assizes . Proceedings began three days after the winter Assizes opened , on 22 March . Turpin was charged with the theft of Creasy 's horses : a mare worth three pounds , a foal worth 20 shillings , and a gelding worth three pounds . The indictments stated that the alleged offences had occurred at Welton on 1 March 1739 , and described Turpin as " John Palmer alias <unk> alias Richard Turpin ... late of the castle of York in the County of York labourer " . Technically the charges were invalid — the offences had occurred at Heckington , not Welton , and the date was also incorrect ; the offences were in August 1738 . 
 Presiding over the trial was Sir William Chapple , a senior and respected judge in his early sixties . The prosecution was directed by King 's Counsel Thomas Place and Richard Crowle ( brother of George ) , and proceedings were recorded by a York resident , Thomas Kyll . Turpin had no defence barrister ; during this period of English history , those accused had no right to legal representation , and their interests were cared for by the presiding judge . Among the seven witnesses called to testify were Thomas Creasy , and James Smith , the man who had recognised Turpin 's handwriting . Turpin offered little in the way of questioning his accusers ; when asked if he had anything to ask of Creasy , he replied " I cannot say anything , for I have not any witnesses come this day , as I have expected , and therefore beg of your Lordship to put off my trial ' till another day " , and when asked about Smith , he claimed not to know him . When questioned himself , Turpin told the court that he had bought the mare and foal from an inn @-@ keeper near Heckington . He repeated his original story of how he had come to use the pseudonym Palmer , claiming that it was his mother 's maiden name . When asked by the judge for his name before he came to Lincolnshire , he said " Turpin " . Without leaving the courtroom the jury found Turpin guilty of the first charge of stealing the mare and foal , and following further proceedings , guilty of stealing the gelding . Throughout the trial Turpin had repeatedly claimed that he had not been allowed enough time to form his defence , that proceedings should be delayed until he could call his witnesses , and that the trial should be held at Essex . Before sentencing him , the judge asked Turpin if he could offer any reason why he should not be sentenced to death ; Turpin said : " It is very hard upon me , my Lord , because I was not <unk> 'd for my Defence . " The judge replied : " Why was you not ? You knew the Time of the Assizes as well as any Person here . " Despite Turpin 's pleas that he had been told the trial would be held in Essex , the judge replied : " Whoever told you so were highly to blame ; and as your country have found you guilty of a crime worthy of death , it is my office to pronounce sentence against you " , sentencing him to death . 
 = = Execution = = 
 Before his execution , Turpin frequently received visitors ( the gaoler was reputed to have earned £ 100 from selling drinks to Turpin and his guests ) , although he refused the efforts of a local clergyman who offered him " serious remonstrances and admonitions " . John Turpin may have sent his son a letter , dated 29 March , urging him to " beg of God to pardon your many transgressions , which the thief upon the cross received pardon for at the last hour " . Turpin bought a new frock coat and shoes , and on the day before his execution hired five mourners for three pounds and ten shillings ( to be shared between them ) . On 7 April 1739 , followed by his mourners , Turpin and John Stead ( a horse thief ) were taken through York by open cart to Knavesmire , which was then the city 's equivalent of London 's Tyburn gallows . Turpin " <unk> 'd himself with amazing assurance " , and " bow 'd to the spectators as he passed " . He climbed a ladder to the gallows and spoke to his executioner . York had no permanent hangman , and it was the custom to pardon a prisoner on condition that he acted as executioner . On this occasion , the pardoned man was a fellow highwayman , Thomas Hadfield . An account in The Gentleman 's Magazine for 7 April 1739 notes Turpin 's brashness : " Turpin behaved in an undaunted manner ; as he mounted the ladder , feeling his right leg tremble , he spoke a few words to the <unk> , then threw himself off , and <unk> 'd in five minutes . " 
 The short drop method of hanging meant that those executed were killed by slow strangulation , and so Turpin was left hanging until late afternoon , before being cut down and taken to a tavern in <unk> . The next morning , the body was buried in the graveyard of St George 's Church , Fishergate , opposite what is now the Roman Catholic St George 's Church . On the Tuesday following the burial , the corpse was reportedly stolen by body @-@ snatchers . The theft of cadavers for medical research was a common enough occurrence , and was likely tolerated by the authorities in York . The practice was however unpopular with the general public , and the body @-@ snatchers , together with Turpin 's corpse , were soon apprehended by a mob . The body was recovered and reburied , supposedly this time with quicklime . Turpin 's body is purported to lie in St George 's graveyard , although some doubt remains as to the grave 's authenticity . 
 = = Modern view = = 
 Some of the Turpin legend can be sourced directly to Richard Bayes ' The Genuine History of the Life of Richard Turpin ( 1739 ) , a mixture of fact and fiction hurriedly put together in the wake of the trial , to satisfy a gullible public . The speeches of the condemned , biographies of criminals , and trial literature , were popular genres during the late 17th and early 18th centuries ; written for a mass audience and a precursor to the modern novel , they were " produced on a scale which beggars comparison with any period before or since " . Such literature functioned as news and a " forum in which anxieties about crime , punishment , sin , salvation , the workings of providence and social and moral transgression generally could be expressed and negotiated . " 
 Bayes ' document contains elements of conjecture ; for instance , his claim that Turpin was married to a Miss Palmer ( and not Elizabeth Millington ) is almost certainly incorrect , and the date of Turpin 's marriage , for which no documentary evidence has been found , appears to be based solely on Bayes ' claim that in 1739 Turpin had married 11 or 12 years earlier . His account of those present during the robberies committed by the Essex Gang often contains names that never appeared in contemporary newspaper reports , suggesting , according to author Derek Barlow , that Bayes embellished his story . Bayes ' description of Turpin 's relationship with " King the Highwayman " is almost certainly fictional . Turpin may have known Matthew King as early as 1734 , and had an active association with him from February 1737 , but the story of the " Gentleman Highwayman " may have been created only to link the end of the Essex gang with the author 's own recollection of events . Barlow also views the account of the theft of Turpin 's corpse , appended to Thomas Kyll 's publication of 1739 , as " handled with such delicacy as to amount almost to reverence " , and therefore of suspect provenance . 
 No contemporary portrait exists of Turpin , who as a notorious but unremarkable figure was not considered sufficiently important to be immortalised . An engraving in one edition of Bayes ' 1739 publication , of a man hiding in a cave , is sometimes supposed to be him , but the closest description that exists is that given by John Wheeler , of " a fresh coloured man , very much marked with the small pox , about five feet nine inches high ... wears a blue grey coat and a light coloured wig " . An E @-@ FIT of Turpin , created from such reports , was published by the Castle Museum in York in 2009 . 
 Turpin is best known for his exploits as a highwayman , but before his execution the only contemporary report of him as such was in June 1737 , when a broadsheet entitled " News news : great and wonderful news from London in an uproar or a hue and cry after the Great Turpin , with his escape into Ireland " was published . Although some of his contemporaries became the subject of chapbooks , names such as James Hind , Claude Duval and William Nevison , are not nearly as well @-@ known today as the legend of Dick Turpin , whose fictionalised exploits first began to appear around the turn of the 19th century . It was , however , the story of a fabled ride from London to York that provided the impetus for 19th @-@ century author William Harrison Ainsworth to include and embellish the exploit in his 1834 novel Rookwood . Ainsworth used Turpin as a plot device , describing him in a manner that makes him more lively than the book 's other characters . Turpin is introduced with the pseudonym Palmer , and is later forced to escape on his horse , Black Bess . Although fast enough to keep ahead of those in pursuit , Black Bess eventually dies under the stress of the journey . This scene appealed more to readers than the rest of the work , and as Turpin was depicted as a likeable character who made the life of a criminal seem appealing , the story came to form part of the modern legend surrounding Turpin . The artist Edward Hull capitalised on Ainsworth 's story , publishing six prints of notable events in Turpin 's career . 
 Ainsworth 's tale of Turpin 's overnight journey from London to York on his mare Black Bess has its origins in an episode recorded by Daniel Defoe , in his 1727 work A tour thro ' the Whole Island of Great Britain . After committing a robbery in Kent in 1676 , William Nevison apparently rode to York to establish an alibi , and Defoe 's account of that journey became part of folk legend . A similar ride was attributed to Turpin as early as 1808 , and was being performed on stage by 1819 , but the feat as imagined by Ainsworth ( about 200 miles in less than a day ) is impossible . Nevertheless , Ainsworth 's legend of Black Bess was repeated in works such as Black Bess or the Knight of the Road , a 254 @-@ part penny dreadful published in 1867 – 68 . In these tales , Turpin was the hero , accompanied by his trusty colleagues Claude Duval , Tom King , and Jack Rann . These narratives , which transformed Turpin from a pockmarked thug and murderer into " a gentleman of the road [ and ] a protector of the weak " , followed a popular cultural tradition of romanticising English criminals . This practice is reflected in the ballads written about Turpin , the earliest of which , Dick Turpin , would appear to have been published in 1737 . Later ballads presented Turpin as an 18th @-@ century Robin Hood figure : " Turpin was caught and his trial was passed , and for a game cock he died at last . Five hundred pounds he gave so free , all to Jack Ketch as a small legacy . " 
 Stories about Turpin continued to be published well into the 20th century , and the legend was also transferred to the stage . In 1845 the playwright George Dibdin @-@ Pitt recreated the most notable " facts " of Turpin 's life , and in 1846 Marie Tussaud added a wax sculpture of Turpin to her collection at Madame Tussauds . In 1906 actor Fred <unk> wrote and starred in the film Dick Turpin 's Last Ride to York . Other silent versions appeared for the silver screen , and some adaptations even moulded Turpin into a figure styled on Robin Hood . Sid James appeared as Turpin in the 1974 Carry On film , Carry On Dick , and LWT cast Richard O 'Sullivan as Turpin in their eponymous series , Dick Turpin . 
 = 1933 FA Cup Final = 
 The 1933 FA Cup Final was a football match between Everton and Manchester City on 29 April 1933 at Wembley Stadium in London . The deciding match of English football 's primary cup competition , the Football Association Challenge Cup ( better known as the FA Cup ) , it was the 62nd final , and the 11th at Wembley . The 1933 final was the first where the players , including goalkeepers , were issued numbers for identification . Everton were allocated numbers 1 – 11 and Manchester City numbers 12 – 22 . 
 Each team progressed through five rounds to reach the final . Everton won 3 – 0 , with goals from Jimmy Stein , Dixie Dean and James Dunn , and won the cup for the first time since 1906 .

 Both teams entered the competition in the third round , the entry point for First Division clubs . Everton were drawn to play Leicester City at Filbert Street , an all First Division tie . The match was close ; Dixie Dean scored for Everton after three minutes , but Leicester quickly levelled the score . A goal by Jimmy Stein gave Everton a 2 – 1 half @-@ time lead , but Leicester again equalised . James Dunn eventually scored to secure a 3 – 2 win for Everton . Second Division Bury provided the opposition in the fourth round . Tommy Johnson scored twice for Everton in the opening half @-@ hour . From that point , though Bury enjoyed significant spells of possession , Everton thwarted their efforts by preying on Bury mistakes . In the second half Dean added a third goal from a rebounded Cliff Britton free @-@ kick , and Bury scored a late consolation goal . Everton were drawn at to play Leeds United at home in the fifth round . Leeds ' strong league form meant Everton entered the match as slight underdogs despite home advantage . Everton goalkeeper Ted Sagar made two important saves in the first half to deny Arthur Hydes and Billy Furness . Everton the gained the upper hand and scored twice , Dean with the first , and Stein with the second , direct from a corner . 
 Against Third Division Luton Town in the quarter @-@ final , Everton won comfortably . The match remained scoreless for half an hour , but after Stein opened the scoring for Everton the match became one @-@ sided , and ended 6 – 0 . Stein and Johnson both scored twice , along with a goal each for Dunn and Dean , the latter maintaining his record of scoring in every round . By this time Everton were viewed as favourites to win the competition . In the semi @-@ final they played West Ham at Molineux , Wolverhampton . Everton took the lead in the sixth minute . A corner kick by Stein was headed on by Johnson , and then headed into the net by Dunn . Everton had the better of the play in the first half , but Vic Watson scored for West Ham just before half @-@ time . In the second half West Ham 's Woods missed an open goal from six yards ( <unk> ) . Everton then capitalised on their reprieve . With seven minutes remaining , a mistake by Jim Barrett allowed Edward Critchley to go clear on goal and score the winner . 
 = = = Manchester City = = = 
 Manchester City started the competition at Third Division Gateshead . Despite the disparity in league positions , a heavy pitch made for an even game , which finished 1 – 1 . The replay at Maine Road was one @-@ sided . A 9 – 0 Manchester City win featured six different scorers , including a hat @-@ trick from Fred Tilson . In the fourth round Manchester City faced another Third Division side , Walsall , who had provided the surprise result of the third round by defeating league leaders Arsenal . Brook scored both goals in a 2 – 0 win , in which Walsall 's Reed was sent off for a foul on Brook . The fifth round brought a short trip to Bolton Wanderers , where the attendance of 69 @,@ 920 was the highest of the round . Bolton took the lead , but Brook scored twice in quick succession to give Manchester City the advantage at the interval . Bolton equalised when a gust of wind caught Raymond Westwood 's corner . Brook completed a hat trick with a penalty to regain the lead , and in the closing minutes Tilson completed a 4 – 2 victory . The Manchester Guardian suggested Brook 's " magnificent display " made him a contender for an England call @-@ up . 
 Manchester City 's quarter @-@ final was against Burnley of the Second Division . City took the lead early in the match following a solo goal by Tilson . In the second @-@ half Burnley discarded their passing game in favour of a direct approach , and pressured the Manchester City goal . The City defence stood firm , and the match finished 1 – 0 . City 's opponents for the semi @-@ final , held at Leeds Road , Huddersfield , were Derby County . Derby had two chances to score in the first half , but both were missed . A Manchester City counter @-@ attack produced the opening goal , when Brook crossed and Toseland headed in . By midway through the second half Manchester City led by three goals . The second was scored by Tilson , a follow @-@ up after an initial saved shot . McMullan scored the third after dribbling through the Derby defence . Derby mounted a late comeback . A goal by Howard Fabian reduced the deficit to two , and Sammy Crooks added a late second for Derby , but it was too late to affect the result of the match , which ended 3 – 2 .

 Everton had contested the final on four previous occasions . They beat Newcastle United 1 – 0 to win the Cup in 1906 , but were defeated in the 1893 , 1897 and 1907 finals . The 1933 final was Manchester City 's third . Both their previous finals were against Bolton Wanderers . Manchester City won by a goal to nil in 1904 , and lost by the same scoreline in 1926 . Both teams had performed well in the previous season . Manchester City reached the semi @-@ finals of the 1932 FA Cup ; Everton were reigning league champions . The clubs had never previously met in cup competition . The league matches between the two earlier in the season each finished as a win for the home team . At the time of the final , Everton 's league position was tenth , and Manchester City 's sixteenth . Newspapers did not declare a clear favourite for the win . Everton were viewed as having the more skilful players , particularly their forwards , whereas Manchester City were seen as having greater strength and determination . 
 Everton spent the week before the match in the spa town of Buxton , and travelled to Dorking on the eve of the match . Manchester City spent the week in Bushey . Everton 's James Dunn received treatment on a thigh injury in the ten days preceding the game , but was anticipated to be fit enough to play . Manchester City 's main injury worry was Fred Tilson , who was troubled by a leg injury . Dunn was passed fit well before the game , allowing Everton to field the same line @-@ up that played in four of their five previous cup ties . 
 Ten miles ( 16 km ) of barbed wire was used to secure Wembley Stadium against unauthorised entry . The pre @-@ match entertainment was music by the Band of the Irish Guards , and communal singing backed by the band of the Royal Horse Guards . Inclement weather prevented the attendance of King George V. Instead the guest of honour was the Duke of York . Other guests present included Baron Wigram , Admiral Sir Lionel Halsey , Austrian envoy Baron von <unk> and the West Indies cricket team . 
 The Manchester City line @-@ up contained two survivors from the 1926 team , Sam Cowan and Jimmy McMullan . The only Everton player with cup final experience was Tommy Johnson , who also played for Manchester City in the 1926 final . He represented the Manchester club between 1919 and 1930 , and at the time of the 1933 final was Manchester City 's all @-@ time highest goalscorer . 
 Both teams usually wore blue , causing a colour clash . The competition rules required both teams to wear alternative colours . For the first time in a cup final , the players wore numbered shirts . Everton were numbered 1 – 11 , and Manchester City 12 – 22 . Everton goalkeeper Sagar wore 1 , with the forwards bearing the higher numbers . Manchester City were the reverse . Forward Brook wore 12 , through to goalkeeper Langford who wore 22 . 
 = = Match = = 
 Each team played the formation typical of the era : two full @-@ backs , three half @-@ backs and five forwards . With Tilson absent from the Manchester City line @-@ up , Alec Herd moved across to Tilson 's usual centre @-@ forward position , and Bobby Marshall was selected at inside @-@ right . 
 Manchester City had the first attack of the match , but it came to nothing . Soon Everton began to dominate the match , with Dean frequently involved in the attacking play . Several Everton attacks came on their left flank . Stein caused Manchester City right @-@ back Sid Cann problems , and Cann was forced to concede a corner kick on several occasions . Just after the half @-@ hour Everton had their first shot on target , when Stein 's effort was saved by Langford . Another chance quickly arrived . Stein 's cross passed in front of goal , but Dean was unable to connect with the ball . Two minutes later Manchester City goalkeeper Langford attempted to catch a cross from Britton , but dropped the ball under pressure from Dean . The ball fell into the path of Stein , who put the ball into the empty net to give Everton the lead . At half @-@ time Everton led 1 – 0 . 
 Everton continued to control the game in the second half . Manchester City took shots from long range , but none required Sagar to make a save . Seven minutes into the second half , Langford again failed to catch a Britton cross , and Dean charged to the net . Dean , ball and goalkeeper all landed in the goal , making the score 2 – 0 . Manchester City then made a few fruitless attacks . As was the case throughout the game , the Everton defence outplayed the Manchester City forwards . The Manchester Guardian singled out <unk> Cresswell for particular praise , describing his performance as " an almost perfect display " . Ten minutes from time a Dunn header from a corner made the score 3 – 0 to Everton . Just before the end Everton 's Johnson had a chance to make it 4 – 0 , but the referee blew his whistle for full @-@ time before Johnson could take his shot .

 Everton captain Dixie Dean led his team to the Royal Box and received the cup from the Duke of York . Everton returned to Liverpool on the Monday evening , and paraded the city in the same horse @-@ drawn carriage used in the celebrations of their previous cup win in 1906 . The players attended a reception at the town hall , where large crowds greeted them . After the reception the cup was taken to Goodison Park for public viewing . 
 Newsreels of the final featured post @-@ match toasts by the two captains . First Dixie Dean , raising his glass , said " Here 's to Lancashire , and may the cup stay in Lancashire . If Everton don 't win it , may another Lancashire club win it . " Cowan replied " I hope the next Lancashire club that wins it is Manchester City , my club " . The following year 's final made the captains ' remarks look perceptive . Cowan and his Manchester City team returned , and beat Portsmouth 2 – 1 to win the 1934 cup . Both Manchester City and Everton also went on to win the league championship later in the decade ; Manchester City in 1937 , and Everton in 1939 .

In the 2004 video game Halo 2 , the rank is given to a disgraced commander as a way to atone for his failures . Although the Arbiter is intended to die serving the Covenant leadership , the High Prophets , he survives his missions and the Prophets ' subsequent betrayal of his kind . When he learns that the Prophets ' plans would doom all sentient life in the galaxy to extinction , the Arbiter allies with the Covenant 's enemies — humanity — and stops the ringworld Halo from being activated . The Arbiter is a playable character in Halo 2 and its 2007 sequel Halo 3 ; a different Arbiter appears in the 2009 real @-@ time strategy game Halo Wars , which takes place 20 years before the events of the main trilogy . 
 The appearance of the Arbiter in Halo 2 and the change in perspective from the main human protagonist Master Chief to a former enemy was a plot twist Halo developer Bungie kept highly secret . The character 's name was changed from " Dervish " after concerns that the name reinforced a perceived United States @-@ versus @-@ Islam allegory in the game 's plot . Award @-@ winning actor Keith David lends his voice to the character in Halo 2 , 3 and 5 , while David Sobolov voices the Arbiter of Halo Wars . 
 The Arbiter has appeared in three series of action figures and other collectibles and marketing in addition to appearances in the games . Bungie intended the sudden point of view switch to a member of the Covenant as a plot twist that no one would have seen coming , but the character in particular and the humanization of the Covenant in general was not evenly received by critics and fans . Computer and Video Games derided the Arbiter 's missions as " crap bits " in Halo 2 . Conversely , IGN lamented the loss of the Arbiter 's story in Halo 3 and missed the added dimension the character provided to the story .

 The Arbiter in the video games Halo 2 ( 2004 ) and Halo 3 ( 2007 ) is voiced by Keith David , a New York actor . David noted that he enjoys voicing complicated characters who have a past . To make an impact with voice acting , he says , is difficult — " it 's either good acting or it 's bad acting " . David is not a frequent video game player , but stated that he has become more known for his work as the Arbiter than for his film and other voice roles . 
 The Arbiter changed very little during development , as the overall appearance of the alien Covenant Elites had been designed and developed for the previous game , 2001 's Halo : Combat Evolved . The only substantial difference between the Arbiter and other Elites is ceremonial armor seen in early concept sketches and which appeared in the final design . During Halo 2 's early developmental stages the character 's name was " Dervish " , a name from the Sufi sect of Islam . Out of context , Microsoft Game Studios ' " geocultural review " consultants found nothing wrong with the name . However , as Tom Edwards , a consultant who worked with Microsoft during the review noted , " within the game 's context this Islamic @-@ related name of ' Dervish ' set up a potentially problematic allegory related to Halo 2 's plot — the [ United States ] -like forces ( Master Chief / Sarge ) versus Islam ( the religious Covenant , which already had a ' Prophet of Truth ' which is one title for Muhammad ) . Since this incident was not long after the September 11 attacks , sensitivity to the name remained high , and the character 's name was changed to the " Arbiter " . 
 In an interview with MTV , Halo developer Bungie 's former content manager Frank O 'Connor said that the inclusion of the Arbiter as a playable character in Halo 2 was supposed to be a " secret on the scale of a Shyamalan plot twist " and explains that Bungie was able to keep the public uninformed about this until the game 's release , to the point that O 'Connor never even considered including it on the weekly development updates posted at Bungie 's webpage . O 'Connor also stated that Bungie " had some other things that were secrets within secrets " and claimed that there was material related to the Arbiter that was kept secret during the development of Halo 3 because " There is an aspect of the Arbiter 's character that is still secret to this day and will remain so for a good reason . " Story director Joseph Staten said that the purpose of introducing the Arbiter was " to offer another , compelling point of view on a war where telling friend from foe wasn 't always clear @-@ cut . We knew we had a trilogy on our hands , so we were looking past the shock of playing as the enemy [ to the events of Halo 3 ] " .

 Presented in Halo 2 , the rank of " Arbiter " is bestowed upon a Covenant Elite by the Covenant leadership — the High Prophets — during a time of " extraordinary crisis " . The Arbiter acts as the " Blade of the Prophets " , undertaking highly dangerous missions to preserve the Covenant . It is expected that these soldiers will die in the course of their duties . Although it was originally a rank of great honor , it later became a rank assigned to disgraced or shamed Elites that nevertheless possessed great martial skill , both as a means to have them serve the Covenant , and as a convenient means of disposal after their assigned suicidal missions . 
 The Arbiter in the Halo trilogy , Thel ' <unk> , was previously a Supreme Commander in the Covenant fleet , having commanded the ships that follow the human vessel Pillar of Autumn to the ringworld Halo during the events of Halo : Combat Evolved . A Prophet orders the Autumn not to be destroyed outright , lest the ring be damaged ; this hesitance allows the humans to land on the ring , coordinate a resistance , and ultimately destroy the ring to stop the spread of the parasitic Flood . In the aftermath of the incident ( depicted in Halo : First Strike ) , the commander also loses a Covenant ship to UNSC forces , resulting in the annihilation of a Covenant invasion force heading for Earth . As Halo 2 begins , the Covenant High Council brands the Commander a heretic for letting the ringworld — which the Covenant consider a sacred relic — be destroyed . He is stripped of his rank and branded . Though his public execution is soon to follow , he is spared by the High Prophets ; the Hierarchs give the disgraced Commander a chance to lead troops once again by becoming the Arbiter . 
 The Arbiter 's first mission is to silence a renegade Elite who has been preaching that the Prophets have lied to the Covenant . The Arbiter is then sent to retrieve the " Sacred Icon " from the library on the newly discovered Delta Halo , in order to activate the ring and bring about the Great Journey , the Covenant 's concept of salvation . Though he retrieves the Icon , the Arbiter is betrayed by the Chieftain of the Brutes , Tartarus ; Tartarus reveals that the Prophets have given him and his race carte blanche to massacre the Elites and replace them in the Covenant caste system . Though the Arbiter is believed dead , he is rescued — along with his nemesis , the human soldier Master Chief — by the parasitic Flood intelligence Gravemind . Gravemind reveals that the Great Journey actually spells doom for all sentient life , and sends him to stop Tartarus from activating the ring . In the process of stopping the Brute , the Arbiter and his Elites forge an alliance with the humans Miranda Keyes and Avery Johnson , and the Arbiter slays Tartarus with help from Johnson , halting the firing of the ring . The unexpected shutdown of Halo triggers a standby sequence , which the Arbiter learns has made all the Halo installations ready to fire remotely from a place known as the Ark .

 While the Arbiter remains a playable character in Halo 3 during cooperative gameplay ( the second player in a game lobby controls him ) , the game 's story never switches to the point of view of the Arbiter , as in Halo 2 . For much of Halo 3 , the Arbiter assists human forces in their fight against hostile Covenant forces alongside John @-@ 117 . After the Flood arrive on Earth , the Arbiter persuades Rtas ' Vadum not to glass the entire planet to quell the infestation . Along with a group of humans and Elites , the Arbiter follows the Prophet of Truth 's forces through a slipspace portal to the Ark , where he kills the Prophet . The Master Chief decides to activate the Halo under construction at the Ark to destroy the local Flood while sparing the galaxy at large ; the Arbiter helps to retrieve the artificial intelligence Cortana so that the installation can be fired . During the escape , the ship he and the Master Chief are on split in two ; while the Master Chief is presumed lost , the Arbiter crashes safely to Earth . After attending a ceremony honoring the dead , the Arbiter and the rest of the Elites leave for their homeworld .

 Taking place 20 years before the events of Halo : Combat Evolved , Ensemble Studio 's Halo Wars features a different Arbiter from the character seen in the trilogy . Lead designer David Pottinger described Ensemble 's Arbiter as a " mean guy . He 's Darth Vader times ten . " The characterization stemmed from a desire to make the Covenant more basically " evil " in order to provide a good guy @-@ bad guy conflict . Parts of the Arbiter 's backstory before the game 's events are explained in a tie @-@ in graphic novel , Halo Wars : Genesis . The Elite , Ripa ' <unk> , was given the rank after he fought and lost a campaign against his own clan .

 Arbiter Thel ' Vadam , voiced by Keith David , narrates and appears in a trailer for Halo : The Master Chief Collection , first shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 . The trailer acts as a prelude to Halo 5 : Guardians , in which Thel ' Vadam and his forces ( Swords of Sangheilios ) are locked in a bloody civil war with Covenant loyalists that reside on the home planet Sangheilios . During the game , the Arbiter meets with Spartan Jameson Locke who asks the Arbiter about his views on the Master Chief . The Arbiter tells him that even when the Master Chief was his enemy , he maintained a measure of respect for him and over time came to call the Master Chief has ally and even his friend . Before the Spartans leave , the Arbiter sends his greetings with them for the Master Chief in such a way that shocks the team as no Elite has ever greeted a human in such a way before .

 Following the release of Halo 2 , Joyride Studios released an Arbiter action figure . This particular model was reviewed by Armchair Empire 's Aaron Simmer as a " great translation of the source material into plastic " . Simmer described the figure 's dimensions were in proportion with other figures released by the studio , and praised the level of detail in the armor and weapons , but found fault with the neck articulation and design . Other aspects mentioned were its compatibility with the Master Chief 's action figure and its durability . Several models of the Arbiter are featured in the Halo ActionClix collectible game , produced as promotional material prior to the release of Halo 3 . McFarlane Toys was given the task of developing a Halo 3 line of action figures , and a sculpt of the Arbiter was released in the second series of figures after the game 's release in July 2008 . A large @-@ scale , non @-@ articulated Arbiter figure was produced by McFarlane as part of the " Legendary Collection " .
