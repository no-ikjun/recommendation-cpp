 = = Etymology = = 
 In Vedic Sanskrit , yoga ( from the root yuj ) means " to add " , " to join " , " to unite " , or " to attach " in its most common literal sense . By figurative extension from the <unk> or harnessing of oxen or horses , the word took on broader meanings such as " employment , use , application , performance " ( compare the figurative uses of " to harness " as in " to put something to some use " ) . All further developments of the sense of this word are post @-@ Vedic . More prosaic moods such as " exertion " , " endeavour " , " zeal " , and " diligence " are also found in Indian epic poetry . 
 There are very many compound words containing yoga in Sanskrit . Yoga can take on meanings such as " connection " , " contact " , " union " , " method " , " application " , " addition " and " performance " . In simpler words , Yoga also means " combined " . For example , <unk> means " contact with a cord " ; <unk> has a medical sense of " applying a splint or similar instrument by means of pulleys ( in case of dislocation of the thigh ) " ; <unk> has the astronomical sense of " conjunction of the moon with a constellation " ; <unk> is a grammatical term expressing " connection or relation with a man " , etc . Thus , <unk> means " devoted attachment " in the monotheistic Bhakti movement . The term <unk> has a grammatical sense , meaning " connection with a verb " . But the same compound is also given a technical meaning in the Yoga Sutras ( 2 @.@ 1 ) , designating the " practical " aspects of the philosophy , i.e. the " union with the supreme " due to performance of duties in everyday life 
 According to Pāṇini , a 6th @-@ century BCE Sanskrit grammarian , the term yoga can be derived from either of two roots , yujir yoga ( to yoke ) or yuj samādhau ( to concentrate ) . In the context of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali , the root yuj samādhau ( to concentrate ) is considered by traditional commentators as the correct etymology . In accordance with Pāṇini , Vyasa who wrote the first commentary on the Yoga Sutras , states that yoga means samādhi ( concentration ) . 
 According to Dasgupta , the term yoga can be derived from either of two roots , yujir yoga ( to yoke ) or yuj samādhau ( to concentrate ) . Someone who practices yoga or follows the yoga philosophy with a high level of commitment is called a yogi ( may be applied to a man or a woman ) or yogini ( traditionally denoting a woman ) . 
 = = Goals = = 
 The ultimate goal of Yoga is moksha ( liberation ) , although the exact definition of what form this takes depends on the philosophical or theological system with which it is conjugated . 
 According to Jacobsen , " Yoga has five principal meanings : 
 Yoga , as a disciplined method for attaining a goal ; 
 Yoga , as techniques of controlling the body and the mind ; 
 Yoga , as a name of one of the schools or systems of philosophy ( darśana ) ; 
 Yoga , in connection with other words , such as " <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , " referring to traditions specialising in particular techniques of yoga ; 
 Yoga , as the goal of Yoga practice . " 
 According to David Gordon White , from the 5th century CE onward , the core principles of " yoga " were more or less in place , and variations of these principles developed in various forms over time : 
 Yoga , is a meditative means of discovering dysfunctional perception and cognition , as well as overcoming it for release from suffering , inner peace and salvation ; illustration of this principle is found in Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and Yogasutras , in a number of Buddhist <unk> works , as well as Jain texts ; 
 Yoga , as the raising and expansion of consciousness from oneself to being coextensive with everyone and everything ; these are discussed in sources such as in Hinduism Vedic literature and its Epic Mahābhārata , Jainism <unk> , and Buddhist Nikaya texts ; 
 Yoga , as a path to omniscience and enlightened consciousness enabling one to comprehend the impermanent ( illusive , delusive ) and permanent ( true , transcendent ) reality ; examples are found in Hinduism Nyaya and <unk> school texts as well as Buddhism <unk> texts , but in different ways ; 
 Yoga , as a technique for entering into other bodies , generating multiple bodies , and the attainment of other supernatural accomplishments ; these are , states White , described in Tantric literature of Hinduism and Buddhism , as well as the Buddhist <unk> ; James Mallinson , however , disagrees and suggests that such fringe practices are far removed from the mainstream Yoga 's goal as meditation @-@ driven means to liberation in Indian religions . 
 White clarifies that the last principle relates to legendary goals of " yogi practice " , different from practical goals of " yoga practice , " as they are viewed in South Asian thought and practice since the beginning of the Common Era , in the various Hindu , Buddhist , and Jain philosophical schools .

 The term " yoga " has been applied to a variety of practices and methods , including Jain and Buddhist practices . In Hinduism these include Jnana Yoga , Bhakti Yoga , Karma Yoga , Laya Yoga and Hatha Yoga . 
 The so @-@ called Raja Yoga refers to Ashtanga Yoga , the eight limbs to be practiced to attain samadhi , as described in the Yoga Sutras of <unk> .

 Yoga is considered as a philosophical school in Hinduism . Yoga , in this context , is one of the six <unk> schools of Hinduism ( those which accept the Vedas as source of knowledge ) . 
 Due to the influence of Vivekananda , the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are nowadays considered as the foundational scripture of classical yoga , a status which it only acquired in the 20th century . Before the twentieth century , other works were considered as the most central works , such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Vasistha , while Tantric Yoga and Hatha Yoga prevailed over Ashtanga Yoga .

 Yoga as described in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali refers to Ashtanga Yoga .

 Ashtanga Yoga incorporates epistemology , metaphysics , ethical practices , systematic exercises and self @-@ development techniques for body , mind and spirit . Its epistemology ( <unk> ) is same as the Samkhya school . Both accept three reliable means to knowledge – perception ( <unk> , direct sensory observations ) , inference ( <unk> ) and testimony of trustworthy experts ( <unk> , <unk> ) . Both these orthodox schools are also strongly dualistic . Unlike <unk> school of Hinduism which pursues non @-@ theistic / atheistic rationalist approach , Yoga school of Hinduism accepts the concept of a " personal , yet essentially inactive , deity " or " personal god " . Along with its epistemology and metaphysical foundations , Yoga school of Hindu philosophy incorporates ethical precepts ( yamas and niyamas ) and an introspective way of life focused on perfecting one 's self physically , mentally and spiritually , with the ultimate goal being kaivalya ( liberated , unified , content state of existence ) .

 Apart from the spiritual goals , the physical postures of yoga are used to alleviate health problems , reduce stress and make the spine supple in contemporary times . Yoga is also used as a complete exercise program and physical therapy routine . 
 While the practice of yoga continues to rise in contemporary American culture , sufficient and adequate knowledge of the practice 's origins does not . According to Andrea R. Jain , Yoga is undoubtedly a Hindu movement for spiritual meditation , yet is now being marketed as a supplement to a cardio routine . This scope " dilutes its Hindu identity . " Contemporaries of the Hindu faith argue that the more popular yoga gets , the less concerned people become about its origins in history . These same contemporaries do state that while anyone can practice yoga , only those who give Hinduism due credit for the practice will achieve the full benefit of the custom . 
 In 2015 the Australian Government 's Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance ; Yoga was one of 17 practices evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found , with the caveat that " Reviewers were limited in drawing definite conclusions , not only due to a lack of studies for some clinical conditions , but also due to the lack of information reported in the reviews and potentially in the primary studies .

 = = History = = 
 The origins of yoga are a matter of debate . There is no consensus on its chronology or specific origin other than that yoga developed in ancient India . Suggested origins are the Indus Valley Civilization ( 3300 – 1900 BCE ) and pre @-@ Vedic Eastern India , the Vedic period ( 1500 – 500 BCE ) , and the śramaṇa movement . According to Gavin Flood , continuities may exist between those various traditions : 
 [ T ] his <unk> is too simplistic , for continuities can undoubtedly be found between renunciation and vedic Brahmanism , while elements from non @-@ Brahmanical , Sramana traditions also played an important part in the formation of the renunciate ideal . 
 Pre @-@ philosophical speculations of yoga begin to emerge in the texts of c . 500 – 200 BCE . Between 200 BCE – 500 CE philosophical schools of Hinduism , Buddhism and Jainism were taking form and a coherent philosophical system of yoga began to emerge . The Middle Ages saw the development of many satellite traditions of yoga . Yoga came to the attention of an educated western public in the mid 19th century along with other topics of Indian philosophy .

 Yoga may have pre @-@ Vedic elements . Some state yoga originated in the Indus Valley Civilization .

 According to Crangle , Indian researchers have generally favoured a linear theory , which attempts " to interpret the origin and early development of Indian contemplative practices as a sequential growth from an Aryan genesis " , just like traditional Hinduism regards the Vedas to be the source of all spiritual knowledge . 
 Ascetic practices , concentration and bodily postures described in the Vedas may have been precursors to yoga . According to Geoffrey Samuel , " Our best evidence to date suggests that [ yogic ] practices developed in the same ascetic circles as the early <unk> movements ( Buddhists , Jainas and <unk> ) , probably in around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE . " 
 According to Zimmer , Yoga philosophy is reckoned to be part of the non @-@ Vedic system , which also includes the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy , Jainism and Buddhism : " [ Jainism ] does not derive from Brahman @-@ Aryan sources , but reflects the cosmology and anthropology of a much older pre @-@ Aryan upper class of northeastern India [ Bihar ] – being rooted in the same subsoil of archaic metaphysical speculation as Yoga , Sankhya , and Buddhism , the other non @-@ Vedic Indian systems .

 The first use of the root of word " yoga " is in hymn 5 @.@ 81 @.@ 1 of the Rig Veda , a dedication to rising Sun @-@ god in the morning ( Savitri ) , where it has been interpreted as " yoke " or " <unk> control " . 
 The earliest evidence of Yogis and Yoga tradition is found in the Keśin hymn 10 @.@ 136 of the Rigveda , states Karel Werner . 
 The Yogis of Vedic times left little evidence of their existence , practices and achievements . And such evidence as has survived in the Vedas is scanty and indirect . Nevertheless , the existence of accomplished Yogis in Vedic times cannot be doubted . 
 Rigveda , however , does not describe yoga and there is little evidence as to what the practices were . Early references to practices that later became part of yoga , are made in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad , the earliest Hindu Upanishad . For example , the practice of pranayama ( consciously regulating breath ) is mentioned in hymn 1 @.@ 5 @.@ 23 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad ( c . ~ 900 BCE ) , and the practice of pratyahara ( concentrating all of one 's senses on self ) is mentioned in hymn 8 @.@ 15 of Chandogya Upanishad ( c . ~ 800 – 700 BCE ) .

Early <unk> also contain references to other group ascetics such as <unk> , the <unk> , and <unk> . Techniques for controlling breath and vital energies are mentioned in the Brahmanas ( texts of the Vedic corpus , c . 1000 – 800 BCE ) and the Atharvaveda .

 Yoga concepts begin to emerge in the texts of c . 500 – 200 BCE such as the Pali Canon , the middle Upanishads , the Bhagavad Gita and Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata . 
 = = = = Upanishads = = = = 
 The first known appearance of the word " yoga " , with the same meaning as the modern term , is in the Katha Upanishad , composed about fourth to third century BCE , where it is defined as the steady control of the senses , which along with cessation of mental activity , leading to a supreme state . Katha Upanishad integrates the monism of early Upanishads with concepts of <unk> and yoga . It defines various levels of existence according to their proximity to the innermost being Ātman . Yoga is therefore seen as a process of <unk> or ascent of consciousness . It is the earliest literary work that highlights the fundamentals of yoga . White states : 
 The earliest extant systematic account of yoga and a bridge from the earlier Vedic uses of the term is found in the Hindu Katha <unk> ( Ku ) , a scripture dating from about the third century BCE [ … ] [ I ] t describes the hierarchy of mind @-@ body constituents — the senses , mind , intellect , etc . — that comprise the foundational categories of <unk> philosophy , whose metaphysical system grounds the yoga of the Yogasutras , Bhagavad Gita , and other texts and schools ( <unk> – 11 ; 6 @.@ 7 – 8 ) . 
 The hymns in Book 2 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad , another late first millennium BCE text , states a procedure in which the body is held in upright posture , the breath is restrained and mind is <unk> focussed , preferably inside a cave or a place that is simple , plain , of silence or gently flowing water , with no noises nor harsh winds . 
 The <unk> Upanishad , likely composed in a later century than Katha and Shvetashvatara Upanishads but before Patanjali 's Yoga Sutra , mentions sixfold yoga method – breath control ( pranayama ) , introspective withdrawal of senses ( pratyahara ) , meditation ( dhyana ) , mind concentration ( <unk> ) , philosophical inquiry / creative reasoning ( <unk> ) , and absorption / intense spiritual union ( samadhi ) . 
 In addition to the Yoga discussion in above Principal Upanishads , twenty Yoga Upanishads as well as related texts such as Yoga Vasistha , composed in 1st and 2nd millennium CE , discuss Yoga methods .

 Alexander the Great reached India in the 4th century BCE . Along with his army , he took Greek academics with him who later wrote memoirs about geography , people and customs they saw . One of Alexander 's companion was Onesicritus , quoted in Book 15 , Sections 63 – 65 by Strabo , who describes yogins of India . Onesicritus claims those Indian yogins ( <unk> ) practiced aloofness and " different postures – standing or sitting or lying naked – and motionless " . 
 Onesicritus also mentions his colleague Calanus trying to meet them , who is initially denied audience , but later invited because he was sent by a " king curious of wisdom and philosophy " . Onesicritus and Calanus learn that the yogins consider the best doctrine of life as " rid the spirit of not only pain , but also pleasure " , that " man trains the body for toil in order that his opinions may be strengthened " , that " there is no shame in life on frugal fare " , and that " the best place to inhabit is one with <unk> equipment or outfit " . These principles are significant to the history of spiritual side of yoga . These may reflect the ancient roots of " undisturbed calmness " and " mindfulness through balance " in later works of Hindu Patanjali and Buddhist Buddhaghosa respectively , states Charles Rockwell Lanman ; as well as the principle of Aparigraha ( non @-@ possessiveness , non @-@ craving , simple living ) and asceticism discussed in later Hinduism and Jainism .

 Werner states , " The Buddha was the founder of his [ Yoga ] system , even though , admittedly , he made use of some of the experiences he had previously gained under various Yoga teachers of his time . " He notes : 
 " But it is only with Buddhism itself as expounded in the Pali Canon that we can speak about a systematic and comprehensive or even integral school of Yoga practice , which is thus the first and oldest to have been preserved for us in its entirety . " 
 The chronology of completion of these yoga @-@ related Pali Canons , however , is unclear , just like ancient Hindu texts . Early known Buddhist sources like the Majjhima Nikāya mention meditation , while the <unk> Nikāya describes <unk> ( <unk> ) that resemble early Hindu descriptions of Muni , <unk> and meditating ascetics , but these meditation @-@ practices are not called yoga in these texts . The earliest known specific discussion of yoga in the Buddhist literature , as understood in modern context , is from the third- to fourth @-@ century CE scriptures of the Buddhist Yogācāra school and fourth- to fifth @-@ century Visuddhimagga of Buddhaghosa . 
 A yoga system that predated the Buddhist school is Jain yoga . But since Jain sources postdate Buddhist ones , it is difficult to distinguish between the nature of the early Jain school and elements derived from other schools . Most of the other contemporary yoga systems alluded in the Upanishads and some Pali canons are lost to time . 
 The early Buddhist texts describe meditative practices and states , some of which the Buddha borrowed from the śramaṇa tradition . The Pali canon contains three passages in which the Buddha describes pressing the tongue against the palate for the purposes of controlling hunger or the mind , depending on the passage . However , there is no mention of the tongue being inserted into the nasopharynx as in true <unk> <unk> . The Buddha used a posture where pressure is put on the perineum with the heel , similar to even modern postures used to stimulate Kundalini .

 Alexander Wynne , author of The Origin of Buddhist Meditation , observes that formless meditation and elemental meditation might have originated in the Upanishadic tradition . The earliest reference to meditation is in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad , one of the oldest Upanishads . Chandogya Upanishad describes the five kinds of vital energies ( prana ) . Concepts used later in many yoga traditions such as internal sound and veins ( nadis ) are also described in the Upanishad . Taittiriya Upanishad defines yoga as the mastery of body and senses .

 The Bhagavad Gita ( ' Song of the Lord ' ) , uses the term " yoga " extensively in a variety of ways . In addition to an entire chapter ( ch . 6 ) dedicated to traditional yoga practice , including meditation , it introduces three prominent types of yoga : 
 Karma yoga : The yoga of action . 
 Bhakti yoga : The yoga of devotion . 
 Jnana yoga : The yoga of knowledge . 
 The Gita consists of 18 chapters and 700 shlokas ( verses ) , with each chapter named as a different yoga , thus delineating eighteen different yogas . Some scholars divide the Gita into three sections , with the first six chapters with 280 shlokas dealing with Karma yoga , the middle six containing 209 shlokas with Bhakti yoga , and the last six chapters with 211 shlokas as Jnana yoga ; however , this is rough because elements of karma , bhakti and jnana are found in all chapters .

 Description of an early form of yoga called <unk> ( yoga of cessation ) is contained in the <unk> section of the 12th chapter ( Shanti Parva ) of the Mahabharata . The verses of the section are dated to c . 300 – 200 BCE . <unk> emphasizes progressive withdrawal from the contents of empirical consciousness such as thoughts , sensations etc. until purusha ( Self ) is realized . Terms like <unk> ( subtle reflection ) , <unk> ( discrimination ) and others which are similar to Patanjali 's terminology are mentioned , but not described . There is no uniform goal of yoga mentioned in the Mahabharata . Separation of self from matter , perceiving Brahman everywhere , entering into Brahman etc. are all described as goals of yoga . Samkhya and yoga are conflated together and some verses describe them as being identical . <unk> also describes an early practice of elemental meditation .

 During the period between the Mauryan and the Gupta era ( c . 200 BCE – 500 CE ) philosophical schools of Hinduism , Buddhism and Jainism were taking form and a coherent philosophical system of yoga began to emerge . 
 Yoga as a philosophy is mentioned in Sanskrit texts dated to be completed between 200 BCE – 200 CE . <unk> 's Arthasastra in verse 1 @.@ 2 @.@ 10 , for example , states that there are three categories of <unk> ( philosophies ) – Samkhya ( <unk> ) , Yoga ( theistic ) and Cārvāka ( atheistic materialism ) . 
 = = = = = Samkhya = = = = = 
 Many traditions in India began to adopt systematic methodology by about first century CE . Of these , Samkhya was probably one of the oldest philosophies to begin taking a systematic form . Patanjali systematized Yoga , building them on the foundational metaphysics of Samkhya . In the early works , the Yoga principles appear together with the Samkhya ideas . Vyasa 's commentary on the Yoga Sutras , also called the <unk> ( Commentary on the Exposition of the Sankhya Philosophy ) , describes the relation between the two systems . The two schools have some differences as well . Yoga accepted the conception of " personal god " , while Samkhya developed as a rationalist , non @-@ theistic / atheistic system of Hindu philosophy . Sometimes Patanjali 's system is referred to as <unk> Samkhya in contradistinction to Kapila 's <unk> Samkhya . 
 The parallels between Yoga and Samkhya were so close that Max Müller says that " the two philosophies were in popular parlance distinguished from each other as Samkhya with and Samkhya without a Lord . " 
 = = = = = Yoga Sutras of Patanjali = = = = = 
 In Hindu philosophy , yoga is the name of one of the six orthodox ( which accept the testimony of Vedas ) philosophical schools . Karel Werner , author of Yoga And Indian Philosophy , believes that the process of systematization of yoga which began in the middle and Yoga Upanishads culminated with the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali . 
 There are numerous parallels in the concepts in ancient Samkhya , Yoga and Abhidharma Buddhist schools of thought , particularly from 2nd century BCE to 1st century AD , notes Larson . Patanjali 's Yoga Sutras is a synthesis of these three traditions . From Samkhya , Yoga Sutras adopt the " reflective discernment " ( <unk> ) of <unk> and <unk> ( dualism ) , its metaphysical rationalism , as well its three epistemic methods to gaining reliable knowledge . From Abhidharma Buddhism 's idea of <unk> , suggests Larson , Yoga Sutras adopt the pursuit of altered state of awareness , but unlike Buddhist 's concept of no self nor soul , Yoga is physicalist and realist like Samkhya in believing that each individual has a self and soul . The third concept Yoga Sutras synthesize into its philosophy is the ancient ascetic traditions of meditation and introspection , as well as the yoga ideas from middle Upanishads such as Katha , Shvetashvatara and Maitri . 
 Patanjali 's Yoga Sutras are widely regarded as the first compilation of the formal yoga philosophy . The verses of Yoga Sutras are terse . Many later Indian scholars studied them and published their commentaries , such as the Vyasa <unk> ( c . 350 – 450 CE ) . Patanjali 's yoga is also referred to as Raja yoga . Patanjali defines the word " yoga " in his second sutra : 
 <unk> : <unk> ् त @-@ <unk> ् ति <unk> : ( <unk> citta @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> ) 
 - Yoga Sutras 1 @.@ 2 
 This terse definition hinges on the meaning of three Sanskrit terms . I. K. <unk> translates it as " Yoga is the inhibition ( <unk> ) of the modifications ( <unk> ) of the mind ( citta ) " . Swami Vivekananda translates the sutra as " Yoga is restraining the mind @-@ stuff ( Citta ) from taking various forms ( <unk> ) . " Edwin Bryant explains that , to Patanjali , " Yoga essentially consists of meditative practices culminating in attaining a state of consciousness free from all modes of active or discursive thought , and of eventually attaining a state where consciousness is unaware of any object external to itself , that is , is only aware of its own nature as consciousness unmixed with any other object . " 
 If the meaning of yoga is understood as the practice of <unk> ( mental control ) , then it 's goal is " the unqualified state of <unk> ( the perfection of that process ) " , according to Baba Hari Dass . In that context , " yoga ( union ) implies duality ( as in joining of two things or principles ) ; the result of yoga is the <unk> state " , and " as the union of the lower self and higher Self . The <unk> state is characterized by the absence of individuality ; it can be described as eternal peace , pure love , Self @-@ realization , or liberation . " 
 Patanjali 's writing also became the basis for a system referred to as " Ashtanga Yoga " ( " Eight @-@ <unk> Yoga " ) . This eight @-@ limbed concept is derived from the 29th Sutra of the Book 2 of Yoga Sutras . They are : 
 Yama ( The five " abstentions " ) : Ahimsa ( Non @-@ violence , non @-@ harming other living beings ) , Satya ( truthfulness , non @-@ falsehood ) , Asteya ( non @-@ stealing ) , Brahmacharya ( celibacy , fidelity to one 's partner ) , and Aparigraha ( non @-@ avarice , non @-@ possessiveness ) . 
 <unk> ( The five " observances " ) : Śauca ( purity , clearness of mind , speech and body ) , <unk> ( contentment , acceptance of others and of one 's circumstances ) , Tapas ( persistent meditation , perseverance , austerity ) , <unk> ( study of self , self @-@ reflection , study of Vedas ) , and Ishvara @-@ <unk> ( contemplation of God / Supreme Being / True Self ) . 
 Asana : Literally means " seat " , and in Patanjali 's Sutras refers to the seated position used for meditation . 
 Pranayama ( " <unk> Breath " ) : <unk> , breath , " <unk> " , to restrain or stop . Also interpreted as control of the life force . 
 Pratyahara ( " Abstraction " ) : Withdrawal of the sense organs from external objects . 
 Dharana ( " Concentration " ) : Fixing the attention on a single object . 
 Dhyana ( " Meditation " ) : Intense contemplation of the nature of the object of meditation . 
 Samadhi ( " Liberation " ) : merging consciousness with the object of meditation .

 Yoga and Vedanta are the two largest surviving schools of Hindu traditions . They share many thematic principles , concepts and belief in self / soul , but diverge in degree , style and some of their methods . <unk> , Yoga school accepts three means to reliable knowledge , while Advaita Vedanta accepts six ways . Yoga disputes the monism of Advaita Vedanta . Yoga school believes that in the state of moksha , each individual discovers the blissful , liberating sense of himself or herself as an independent identity ; Advaita Vedanta , in contrast , believes that in the state of moksha , each individual discovers the blissful , liberating sense of himself or herself as part of Oneness with everything , everyone and the Universal Self . They both hold that the free conscience is aloof yet transcendent , liberated and self @-@ aware . Further , Advaita Vedanta school enjoins the use of Patanjali 's yoga practices and the reading of Upanishads for those seeking the supreme good , ultimate freedom and <unk> .

 The Yoga Yajnavalkya is a classical treatise on yoga attributed to the Vedic sage Yajnavalkya . It takes the form of a dialogue between Yajnavalkya and Gargi , a renowned philosopher . The text contains 12 chapters and its origin has been traced to the period between the second century BCE and fourth century CE . Many yoga texts like the Hatha Yoga Pradipika , the Yoga Kundalini and the Yoga Tattva Upanishads have borrowed verses from or make frequent references to the Yoga Yajnavalkya . The Yoga Yajnavalkya discusses eight yoga Asanas – Swastika , <unk> , Padma , Vira , Simha , Bhadra , Mukta and <unk> , numerous breathing exercises for body cleansing , and meditation .

In his <unk> , Acarya Kundakunda , describes yoga bhakti — devotion to the path to liberation — as the highest form of devotion . Acarya Haribhadra and Acarya Hemacandra mention the five major vows of ascetics and 12 minor vows of laity under yoga . This has led certain Indologists like Prof. Robert J. <unk> to call Jainism , essentially , a system of yogic thinking that grew into a full @-@ fledged religion . The five yamas or the constraints of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali bear a resemblance to the five major vows of Jainism , indicating a history of strong cross @-@ fertilization between these traditions .

 The Bhakti movement was a development in medieval Hinduism which advocated the concept of a personal God ( or " Supreme Personality of Godhead " ) . The movement was initiated by the <unk> of South India in the 6th to 9th centuries , and it started gaining influence throughout India by the 12th to 15th centuries . Shaiva and Vaishnava bhakti traditions integrated aspects of Yoga Sutras , such as the practical meditative exercises , with devotion . Bhagavata Purana elucidates the practice of a form of yoga called <unk> ( separation ) bhakti . <unk> bhakti emphasizes one pointed concentration on Krishna .

 Tantra is a genre of yoga that arose in India no later than the 5th century CE . George Samuel states , " Tantra " is a contested term , but may be considered as a school whose practices appeared in mostly complete form in Buddhist and Hindu texts by about 10th century CE . Over its history , some ideas of Tantra school influenced the Hindu , Bon , Buddhist , and Jain traditions . Elements of Tantric yoga rituals were adopted by and influenced state functions in medieval Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms in East and Southeast Asia . 
 By the turn of the first millennium , hatha yoga emerged from tantra .

 Vajrayana is also known as Tantric Buddhism and <unk> . Its texts were compiled starting with 7th century and Tibetan translations were completed in 8th century CE . These tantra yoga texts were the main source of Buddhist knowledge that was imported into Tibet .

Yoga is a significant practice in Tantric Buddhism .

 The earliest references to hatha yoga are in Buddhist works dating from the eighth century . The earliest definition of hatha yoga is found in the 11th century Buddhist text <unk> , which defines it in relation to the center channel , bindu etc . The basic tenets of Hatha yoga were formulated by Shaiva ascetics Matsyendranath and Gorakshanath c . 900 CE . Hatha yoga synthesizes elements of Patanjali 's Yoga Sutras with posture and breathing exercises . Hatha yoga , sometimes referred to as the " <unk> yoga " , was further elaborated by Yogi <unk> , compiler of the Hatha Yoga Pradipika in 15th century CE . This yoga differs substantially from the Raja yoga of Patanjali in that it focuses on <unk> , the purification of the physical body as leading to the purification of the mind ( ha ) , and prana , or vital energy ( tha ) . Compared to the seated asana , or sitting meditation posture , of Patanjali 's Raja yoga , it marks the development of asanas ( plural ) into the full body ' postures ' now in popular usage and , along with its many modern variations , is the style that many people associate with the word yoga today . 
 It is similar to a diving board – preparing the body for purification , so that it may be ready to receive higher techniques of meditation . The word " Hatha " comes from " Ha " which means Sun , and " Tha " which means Moon .

 Various yogic groups had become prominent in Punjab in the 15th and 16th century , when Sikhism was in its nascent stage .

Guru Nanak rejected the austerities , rites and rituals connected with Hatha Yoga . He propounded the path of <unk> yoga or Nama yoga ( meditation on the name ) instead . The Guru Granth Sahib states : 
 Listen " O Yogi , Nanak tells nothing but the truth . You must discipline your mind . The devotee must meditate on the Word Divine . It is His grace which brings about the union . He understands , he also sees . Good deeds help one merge into Divination . "

 = = = = Reception in the West = = = = 
 Yoga came to the attention of an educated western public in the mid @-@ 19th century along with other topics of Indian philosophy . In the context of this budding interest , N. C. Paul published his Treatise on Yoga Philosophy in 1851 . 
 The first Hindu teacher to actively advocate and disseminate aspects of yoga to a western audience , Swami Vivekananda , toured Europe and the United States in the 1890s . The reception which Swami Vivekananda received built on the active interest of intellectuals , in particular the New England Transcendentalists , among them R. W. Emerson ( 1803 – 1882 ) , who drew on German Romanticism and the interest of philosophers and scholars like <unk> Hegel ( 1770 – 1831 ) , the brothers August Wilhelm Schlegel ( 1767 – 1845 ) and Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel ( 1772 – 1829 ) , Max Mueller ( 1823 – 1900 ) , Arthur Schopenhauer ( 1788 – 1860 ) and others who had ( to varying degrees ) interests in things Indian . 
 Theosophists also had a large influence on the American public 's view of Yoga . Esoteric views current at the end of the 19th century provided a further basis for the reception of Vedanta and of Yoga with its theory and practice of correspondence between the spiritual and the physical . The reception of Yoga and of Vedanta thus entwined with each other and with the ( mostly Neoplatonism @-@ based ) currents of religious and philosophical reform and transformation throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries . M. Eliade , himself rooted in the Romanian currents of these traditions , brought a new element into the reception of Yoga with the strong emphasis on Tantric Yoga in his seminal book : Yoga : Immortality and Freedom . With the introduction of the Tantra traditions and philosophy of Yoga , the conception of the " transcendent " to be attained by Yogic practice shifted from experiencing the " transcendent " ( " Atman @-@ Brahman " in <unk> theory ) in the mind to the body itself . 
 The American born yogi by the name of Pierre Arnold Bernard , after his travels through the lands of Kashmir and Bengal , founded the <unk> Order of America in 1905 . His teachings gave many westerners their first glimpse into the practices of yoga and tantra . 
 The modern scientific study of yoga began with the works of N. C. Paul and Major D. Basu in the late 19th century , and then continued in the 20th century with Sri Yogendra ( 1897 – 1989 ) and Swami <unk> . Western medical researchers came to Swami <unk> 's <unk> Health and Yoga Research Center , starting in 1928 , to study Yoga as a science . 
 The West , in the early 21st century typically associates the term " yoga " with Hatha yoga and its asanas ( postures ) or as a form of exercise . During the 1910s and 1920s in the USA , yoga suffered a period of bad publicity due largely to the backlash against immigration , a rise in puritanical values , and a number of scandals . In the 1930s and 1940s yoga began to gain more public acceptance as a result of celebrity endorsement . In the 1950s the United States saw another period of paranoia against yoga , but by the 1960s , western interest in Hindu spirituality reached its peak , giving rise to a great number of Neo @-@ Hindu schools specifically advocated to a western public . During this period , most of the influential Indian teachers of yoga came from two lineages , those of Sivananda Saraswati ( 1887 – 1963 ) and of Tirumalai Krishnamacharya ( 1888 – 1989 ) . Teachers of Hatha yoga who were active in the west in this period included <unk> Iyengar ( 1918 – 2014 ) , K. <unk> <unk> ( 1915 – 2009 ) , Swami Vishnu @-@ <unk> ( 1927 – 1993 ) , and Swami Satchidananda ( 1914 – 2002 ) . Yogi Bhajan brought Kundalini Yoga to the United States in 1969 . Comprehensive , classical teachings of Ashtanga Yoga , Samkhya , the subtle body theory , Fitness Asanas , and tantric elements were included in the yoga teachers training by Baba Hari Dass ( 1923 – ) , in the United States and Canada . 
 A second " yoga boom " followed in the 1980s , as Dean <unk> , a follower of Swami Satchidananda , connected yoga to heart health , legitimizing yoga as a purely physical system of health exercises outside of counter @-@ culture or esotericism circles , and unconnected to any religious denomination . Numerous asanas seemed modern in origin , and strongly overlapped with 19th and early @-@ 20th century Western exercise traditions . 
 Since 2001 , the popularity of yoga in the USA has risen constantly . The number of people who practiced some form of yoga has grown from 4 million ( in 2001 ) to 20 million ( in 2011 ) . It has drawn support from world leaders such as Barack Obama who stated , " Yoga has become a universal language of spiritual exercise in the United States , crossing many lines of religion and cultures , ... Every day , millions of people practice yoga to improve their health and overall well @-@ being . That 's why we 're encouraging everyone to take part in <unk> ( Presidential Active Lifestyle Award ) , so show your support for yoga and answer the challenge " . 
 The American College of Sports Medicine supports the integration of yoga into the exercise regimens of healthy individuals as long as properly @-@ trained professionals deliver instruction . The College cites yoga 's promotion of " profound mental , physical and spiritual awareness " and its benefits as a form of stretching , and as an enhancer of breath control and of core strength .

 While much of the medical community regards the results of yoga research as significant , others point to many flaws which undermine results . Much of the research on yoga has taken the form of preliminary studies or clinical trials of low methodological quality , including small sample sizes , inadequate blinding , lack of randomization , and high risk of bias . Long @-@ term yoga users in the United States have reported musculoskeletal and mental health improvements , as well as reduced symptoms of asthma in asthmatics . There is evidence to suggest that regular yoga practice increases brain GABA levels , and yoga has been shown to improve mood and anxiety more than some other metabolically @-@ matched exercises , such as walking . The three main focuses of Hatha yoga ( exercise , breathing , and meditation ) make it beneficial to those suffering from heart disease . Overall , studies of the effects of yoga on heart disease suggest that yoga may reduce high blood @-@ pressure , improve symptoms of heart failure , enhance cardiac rehabilitation , and lower cardiovascular risk factors . For chronic low back pain , specialist Yoga for Healthy Lower Backs has been found 30 % more beneficial than usual care alone in a UK clinical trial . Other smaller studies support this finding . The Yoga for Healthy Lower Backs programme is the dominant treatment for society ( both cheaper and more effective than usual care alone ) due to 8 @.@ 5 fewer days off work each year . A research group from Boston University School of Medicine also tested yoga 's effects on lower @-@ back pain . Over twelve weeks , one group of volunteers practiced yoga while the control group continued with standard treatment for back pain . The reported pain for yoga participants decreased by one third , while the standard treatment group had only a five percent drop . Yoga participants also had a drop of 80 % in the use of pain medication . 
 There has been an emergence of studies investigating yoga as a complementary intervention for cancer patients . Yoga is used for treatment of cancer patients to decrease depression , insomnia , pain , and fatigue and to increase anxiety control . Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction ( <unk> ) programs include yoga as a mind @-@ body technique to reduce stress . A study found that after seven weeks the group treated with yoga reported significantly less mood disturbance and reduced stress compared to the control group . Another study found that <unk> had showed positive effects on sleep anxiety , quality of life , and spiritual growth in cancer patients . 
 Yoga has also been studied as a treatment for schizophrenia . Some encouraging , but inconclusive , evidence suggests that yoga as a complementary treatment may help alleviate symptoms of schizophrenia and improve health @-@ related quality of life .

 = = = = = Physical injuries = = = = = 
 A small percentage of yoga practitioners each year suffer physical injuries analogous to sports injuries ; therefore , caution and common sense are recommended . Yoga has been criticized for being potentially dangerous and being a cause for a range of serious medical conditions including thoracic outlet syndrome , degenerative arthritis of the cervical spine , spinal stenosis , retinal tears , damage to the common fibular nerve , " Yoga foot drop , " etc . An exposé of these problems by William Broad published in January , 2012 in The New York Times Magazine resulted in controversy within the international yoga community . Broad , a science writer , yoga practitioner , and author of The Science of Yoga : The Risks and the Rewards , had suffered a back injury while performing a yoga posture . Torn muscles , knee injuries , and headaches are common ailments which may result from yoga practice . 
 An extensive survey of yoga practitioners in Australia showed that about 20 % had suffered some physical injury while practicing yoga . In the previous 12 months 4 @.@ 6 % of the respondents had suffered an injury producing prolonged pain or requiring medical treatment . <unk> , shoulder stands , lotus and half lotus ( seated cross @-@ legged position ) , forward bends , backward bends , and handstands produced the greatest number of injuries . 
 Some yoga practitioners do not recommend certain yoga exercises for women during menstruation , for pregnant women , or for nursing mothers . However , meditation , breathing exercises , and certain postures which are safe and beneficial for women in these categories are encouraged . 
 Among the main reasons that experts cite for causing negative effects from yoga are beginners ' competitiveness and instructors ' lack of qualification . As the demand for yoga classes grows , many people get certified to become yoga instructors , often with relatively little training . Not every newly certified instructor can evaluate the condition of every new trainee in their class and recommend refraining from doing certain poses or using appropriate props to avoid injuries . In turn , a beginning yoga student can overestimate the abilities of their body and strive to do advanced poses before their body is flexible or strong enough to perform them . 
 Vertebral artery dissection , a tear in the arteries in the neck which provide blood to the brain can result from rotation of the neck while the neck is extended . This can occur in a variety of contexts , but is an event which could occur in some yoga practices . This is a very serious condition which can result in a stroke .

 Over time , an extended yoga physiology developed , especially within the tantric tradition and hatha yoga . It pictures humans as composed of three bodies or five sheaths which cover the atman .

 Zen , the name of which derives from the Sanskrit " <unk> " via the Chinese " ch 'an " is a form of Mahayana Buddhism . The Mahayana school of Buddhism is noted for its proximity with yoga .

 In the Nyingma tradition , the path of meditation practice is divided into nine <unk> , or vehicles , which are said to be increasingly profound .

" The Sarma traditions also include Kriya , Upa ( called " <unk> " ) , and Yoga , with the <unk> yoga class substituting for <unk> and <unk> . 
 Other tantra yoga practices include a system of 108 bodily postures practiced with breath and heart rhythm . The Nyingma tradition also practices Yantra yoga ( <unk> .

 = = = Christianity = = = 
 Some Christians integrate yoga and other aspects of Eastern spirituality with prayer and meditation . This has been attributed to a desire to experience God in a more complete way . In 2013 , Monsignor Raffaello Martinelli , servicing Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , having worked for over 23 years with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger ( Pope Benedict XVI ) , said that for his Meditation , a Christian can learn from other religious traditions ( zen , yoga , controlled respiration , Mantra ) , quoting Aspects of Christian meditation : " Just as " the Catholic Church rejects nothing of what is true and holy in these religions , " neither should these ways be rejected out of hand simply because they are not Christian . On the contrary , one can take from them what is useful so long as the Christian conception of prayer , its logic and requirements are never obscured . It is within the context of all of this that these bits and pieces should be taken up and expressed anew . " Previously , the Roman Catholic Church , and some other Christian organizations have expressed concerns and disapproval with respect to some eastern and New Age practices that include yoga and meditation . 
 In 1989 and 2003 , the Vatican issued two documents : Aspects of Christian meditation and " A Christian reflection on the New Age , " that were mostly critical of eastern and New Age practices . The 2003 document was published as a 90 @-@ page handbook detailing the Vatican 's position . The Vatican warned that concentration on the physical aspects of meditation " can degenerate into a cult of the body " and that equating bodily states with mysticism " could also lead to psychic disturbance and , at times , to moral deviations . " Such has been compared to the early days of Christianity , when the church opposed the <unk> ' belief that salvation came not through faith but through a mystical inner knowledge . The letter also says , " one can see if and how [ prayer ] might be enriched by meditation methods developed in other religions and cultures " but maintains the idea that " there must be some fit between the nature of [ other approaches to ] prayer and Christian beliefs about ultimate reality . " Some fundamentalist Christian organizations consider yoga to be incompatible with their religious background , considering it a part of the New Age movement inconsistent with Christianity . 
 Another view holds that Christian meditation can lead to religious pluralism . This is held by an interdenominational association of Christians that practice it . " The ritual simultaneously operates as an anchor that maintains , enhances , and promotes denominational activity and a sail that allows institutional boundaries to be crossed . "

 In early 11th century , the Persian scholar Al Biruni visited India , lived with Hindus for 16 years , and with their help translated several significant Sanskrit works into Arabic and Persian languages . One of these was Patanjali 's Yogasutras . Al Biruni 's translation preserved many of the core themes of Patañjali ' s Yoga philosophy , but certain sutras and analytical commentaries were restated making it more consistent with Islamic monotheistic theology . Al Biruni 's version of Yoga Sutras reached Persia and Arabian peninsula by about 1050 AD . Later , in the 16th century , the hath yoga text <unk> was translated into Arabic and then Persian . Yoga was , however , not accepted by mainstream Sunni and Shia Islam . Minority Islamic sects such as the mystic Sufi movement , particularly in South Asia , adopted Indian yoga practises , including postures and breath control . Muhammad <unk> , a <unk> Sufi and one of the translators of yoga text in 16th century , drew controversy for his interest in yoga and was persecuted for his Sufi beliefs . 
 Malaysia 's top Islamic body in 2008 passed a fatwa , prohibiting Muslims from practicing yoga , saying it had elements of Hinduism and that its practice was blasphemy , therefore haraam . Some Muslims in Malaysia who had been practicing yoga for years , criticized the decision as " insulting . " Sisters in Islam , a women 's rights group in Malaysia , also expressed disappointment and said yoga was just a form of exercise . This fatwa is legally enforceable . However , Malaysia 's prime minister clarified that yoga as physical exercise is permissible , but the chanting of religious mantras is prohibited . 
 In 2009 , the Council of <unk> , an Islamic body in Indonesia , passed a fatwa banning yoga on the grounds that it contains Hindu elements .

 = Carucage = 
 Carucage ( / <unk> / ; Medieval Latin : <unk> , from <unk> , " wheeled plough " ) was a medieval English land tax introduced by King Richard I in 1194 , based on the size — variously calculated — of the estate owned by the taxpayer . It was a replacement for the danegeld , last imposed in 1162 , which had become difficult to collect because of an increasing number of exemptions . Carucage was levied just six times : by Richard in 1194 and 1198 ; John , his brother and successor , in 1200 ; and John 's son , Henry III , in 1217 , 1220 , and 1224 , after which it was replaced by taxes on income and personal property . 
 The taxable value of an estate was initially assessed from the Domesday Survey , but other methods were later employed , such as valuations based on the sworn testimony of neighbours or on the number of plough @-@ teams the taxpayer used . Carucage never raised as much as other taxes , but nevertheless helped to fund several projects . It paid the ransom for Richard 's release in 1194 , after he was taken prisoner by Leopold V , Duke of Austria ; it covered the tax John had to pay Philip II of France in 1200 on land he inherited in that country ; and it helped to finance Henry III 's military campaigns in England and on continental Europe . 
 Carucage was an attempt to secure new sources of revenue in order to supplement and increase royal income in a time when new demands were being made on royal finances . Although derived from the older danegeld , carucage was an experiment in revenue collection , but it was only levied for specific purposes , rather than as a regularly assessed tax . Also new was the fact later collections were imposed with the consent of the barons . However , the main flow of royal income was from other sources , and carucage was not collected again after 1224 . 
 = = Background = = 
 In medieval England there was no clear separation between the king 's household and the treasury . The main sources of royal income were the royal estates , feudal rights ( such as feudal aids or feudal reliefs , which derived from the king 's position as a feudal overlord ) , taxation , and fees and other profits from the judicial courts . In 1130 , the records of revenues paid into the treasury show that about 40 % came from royal estates , 16 % from feudal rights , 14 % from taxes , and 12 % from the judicial courts . By 1194 revenue from the land came to about 37 % of the total , about 25 % came from feudal rights , taxation raised about 15 % , and income from judicial sources about 11 % . 
 English taxation after the Norman Conquest of 1066 was based on the geld or danegeld , a national tax paid by all free men , those who were not serfs or slaves . The geld was based on the number of hides of land owned by the taxpayer , and could be demanded by the king and assessed at varying levels without the need for consultation with the barons or other subjects . During King Henry I 's reign , an increasing number of exemptions , and the difficulties encountered in collecting the geld , lowered its importance to the Exchequer — the treasury of England . It is unclear whether the geld was collected at all during the reign of Henry 's successor , King Stephen . Stephen 's successor , King Henry II , collected the geld only twice , once in 1155 and again in 1161 – 1162 . The geld was unpopular , and after 1162 Henry may have felt it politically expedient to stop collecting it . 
 Most information about the carucage comes from the financial records associated with its collection , but there is no detailed description of the way it was collected or assessed , unlike the account of the workings of the Exchequer given in the Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer , written in about 1180 . Government records such as the Pipe Rolls , the Memoranda Rolls , and other financial records , some of which are specific to the carucage , have survived , and include records of assessments and receipts for the sums collected . There are also occasional references to the tax in medieval chronicles , supplementing the information found in the financial records . 
 = = Under Richard I = = 
 Under Henry 's son , King Richard I , a new land tax was collected , the first since 1162 . It was organised by Hubert Walter , the Justiciar of England who was in charge of governing England while the king was gone . Like the geld , the carucage was based on the amount of land owned , thus targeting free men rather than serfs , who owned no land and were therefore exempt . First collected in 1194 , and the first land tax collected in England since the geld , carucage was based on the size of the estate as measured in either hides or carucates ( a unit of land that could be ploughed by an eight @-@ ox plough @-@ team in a year , which was normally considered equivalent to a hide ) . The original property assessment of the carucage was based on the Domesday Survey , a survey of land holdings in England that was completed by 1087 . 
 Collected again in 1198 , and usually called the " great carucage , " it was initially assessed at a rate of 2 shillings per carucate ( estimated at 100 acres ( 40 ha ) or 120 acres ( 49 ha ) ) , but later an additional 3 shillings per carucate was imposed . This 1198 collection was to provide the king with money for his military campaigns in France , and raised about £ 1 @,@ 000 . A number of fines were subsequently imposed on taxpayers for evading payment , suggesting that the 1198 tax was not very successful . 
 According to the late 12th century chronicler Roger of Howden , the main source for information on the 1198 carucage , assessments were carried out in county by a commission of two royal officials working in each hundred ( a subdivision of a county ) . Each of these commissions included two local knights who would take sworn testimonies in each village from four villagers and the bailiffs or estate officials of those barons holding land in the village . The resulting assessments were recorded , and the sheriff , or chief royal official of the county , would receive the money and forward it to the treasury . Estate holders in the area were responsible for the payments from their estates , and when they were handed to the Exchequer a special procedure was followed to record the payments , which were then deposited into a dedicated set of accounts . These elaborate procedures were probably meant to avoid misappropriation of funds , but may not have been successful , as justices were later sent out to inquire into the commissioners ' activities . As a result of their investigations , 23 counties paid fines to secure an end to royal inquiries and any arrears in payments . 
 The lower clergy and bishops resisted Richard 's attempt to impose the 1198 carucage on their estates . In response , Richard withdrew their access to his royal courts forcing them to buy it back for a sum greater than the carucage would have collected . 
 = = Under John = = 
 King John , Richard 's brother and successor , collected the carucage only once , in 1200 . John set the amount to be collected from each carucate at three shillings . Revenues from this taxation do not appear in the 1200 Pipe Roll , although the designation in official records of William of Wrotham and his assistants as <unk> <unk> — " receivers of the carucage " — suggest that the money raised was paid into a special commission in the Exchequer . Whether lands were assessed by the system used in 1198 is unknown . The contemporary chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall noted that an " order went throughout England by the justices or the king " to collect the tax , which may imply that the King appointed justices to collect the tax instead of using the earlier system . The carucage was raised in order to pay John 's feudal relief — the payment to an overlord on inheriting lands — for his 1199 inheritance of lands in France . The relief had been set by King Philip II of France , John 's overlord , at 20 @,@ 000 marks . Estimates of the amount raised by this carucage — about £ 3 @,@ 000 — are based on later revenues raised during the following reign . 
 The Cistercian monasteries in the north of England resisted the tax , claiming that they were immune to taxation . John put pressure on them , as he was in the north when the tax was announced , but the various abbeys appealed to Hubert Walter , by then Chancellor . Walter secured from the abbeys the promise of a group payment of £ 1 @,@ 000 , but in June 1200 the King rejected the offer . In October , the King returned from Normandy and resumed pressure on the monasteries , ordering the confiscation of all Cistercian livestock on royal lands after two weeks if a settlement was not reached . At the end of November , through Walter 's intercession , the King capitulated and agreed to a Cistercian immunity from this tax . 
 = = Under Henry III = = 
 John 's son , King Henry III , assessed the carucage on three occasions , in 1217 , 1220 , and 1224 . A new approach in 1217 and 1220 was to secure the consent of leading noblemen for the tax to be levied . The 1217 tax was once again assessed at 3 shillings per carucate . The assessment of the amount of lands held by each taxpayer involved having each landowner provide the information and swear an oath that it was correct . Like the 1200 tax , the 1217 tax was not recorded in that year 's Pipe Roll , lending support to the possibility that the revenue from the tax was sent to a separate branch of the Exchequer . The 1217 carucage was only paid by laymen ; the clergy made a donation in lieu of being taxed . The money raised was intended to defray the expense of the war being fought against Prince Louis of France , who had invaded England before the death of King John and was claiming the English throne . 
 The 1220 carucage , which was imposed on both laymen and clergy , was collected by a special commission , and was paid not into the Exchequer , but to the Templar Order church in London , the New Temple . The Templars through their international organization functioned as bankers in and between countries . The three men appointed to the commission — William de Halliwell , a friar , William <unk> , a London resident , and Alexander de Sawbridgeworth , an Exchequer clerk — were responsible for accounting for the money received , which amounted to £ 3 @,@ 000 . The time frame of the 1220 carucage collection was quite short ; the orders for the assessments to be made were issued in August , but required the tax to be collected by Michaelmas in late September . The 1220 tax attempted to allow for variation in land values , exempting barren land from taxation . The system for the 1220 assessments was simpler than the 1217 levy , as plough @-@ teams were counted to determine the land size rather than requiring oaths from taxpayers . This tax gathered around £ 5 @,@ 500 . There was some difficulty in its collection however , as some counties did not pay , and a number of barons refused to pay , at least at first . The 1220 carucage was levied to pay for the defence of Henry 's lands in Poitou , southern France . 
 The 1224 carucage was a tax levied only on the clergy , and the revenues from it did not appear in that year 's Pipe Roll . It is likely that the clergy who owed the carucage also collected the tax . Records indicate that the bulk of the money raised was paid into the Wardrobe , the king 's personal treasury , rather than the Exchequer . The 1224 assessment was based on <unk> , and was imposed to pay for the restitution of the lost lands in France . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The last carucage was imposed in 1224 , after which most of the medieval government 's revenue was raised by levying taxes on moveable or personal property , instead of on land ; taxes on moveable property were first assessed in 1207 . A probable reason for the abandonment of land taxes was the greater revenues raised by taxes on property and income . 
 Carucage was an attempt to secure new sources of revenue to supplement existing sources of income . It was also intended to increase the royal revenues in the face of new demands placed upon them . Although derived from the older geld , carucage was an experiment in revenue collection , but it was only levied for specific purposes , rather than as a general tax regularly assessed . A novel feature was the consultation with the barons and other leading members of the ruling classes . Despite its intermittent use during the reigns of Richard I , John , and the early years of Henry III , the main source of royal income at that time remained scutage , feudal dues such as feudal reliefs or feudal aids , and royal rights such as the profits from the justice system . 
 = Martino Zaccaria = 
 Martino Zaccaria was the Lord of Chios from 1314 to 1329 , ruler of several other Aegean islands , and baron of Veligosti – Damala and <unk> in the Principality of Achaea . He distinguished himself in the fight against Turkish corsairs in the Aegean Sea , and received the title of " King and Despot of Asia Minor " from the titular Latin Emperor , Philip II . He was deposed from his rule of Chios by a Byzantine expedition in 1329 , and imprisoned in Constantinople until 1337 . Martino then returned to Italy , where he was named the Genoese ambassador to the Holy See . In 1343 he was named commander of the Papal squadron in the <unk> crusade against Umur Bey , ruler of the Emirate of Aydin , and participated in the storming of Smyrna in October 1344 . He was killed , along with several other of the crusade 's leaders , in a Turkish attack on 17 January 1345 . 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Lord of Chios and wars against the Turks = = = 
 Martino Zaccaria was a scion of the Genoese Zaccaria family . Through his father , <unk> Zaccaria , he was a nephew to Benedetto I Zaccaria , lord of Chios and of Phocaea on the Anatolian coast . Benedetto I had captured Chios from the Byzantine Empire in 1304 , citing the island 's vulnerability to Turkish raids . His occupation was acknowledged by the impotent Byzantine emperor , Andronikos II Palaiologos , initially for a period of 10 years , but which was then renewed at five @-@ year intervals . Benedetto died in 1307 and was succeeded in Chios by his son , <unk> Zaccaria . When he died childless in 1314 , the island passed to Martino and his brother , Benedetto II . Chios was a small but wealthy domain , with an annual income of 120 @,@ 000 gold hyperpyra . Over the next few years , Martino made it the core of a small realm encompassing several islands off the shore of Asia Minor , including Samos and Kos . 
 As lord of Chios , Martino and Benedetto fought with distinction against the Turkish pirates , who made their appearance in the Aegean in the early years of the 14th century . In 1304 , the capture of Ephesus by the emirate of <unk> had sparked the Genoese occupation of Chios , and raids against the Aegean islands intensified over the next years . The Emirate of Aydin soon emerged as the chief Turkish maritime emirate , especially under the leadership of Umur Bey , while the Zaccaria , along with the Knights Hospitaller of Rhodes , became the two main Latin antagonists of the Turkish pirates . The Zaccaria are reported to have maintained a thousand infantry , a hundred horseman and a couple of galleys on constant alert . In 1317 , they lost the citadel of Smyrna on the Anatolian coast to the <unk> , but continued to hold on to the lower city until 1329 , when Umur Bey captured it . In 1319 , however , Martino Zaccaria participated with seven ships in a Hospitaller fleet that scored a crushing victory over an <unk> fleet from Ephesus . By the end of his rule on Chios , Martino is said to have taken captive or slain more than 10 @,@ 000 Turks , and received an annual tribute in order not to attack them . His constant efforts against the Turkish pirates earned him great praise by contemporary Latin writers , who wrote that if not for his vigilance , " neither man , nor woman , nor dog , nor cat , nor any live animal could have remained in any of the neighbouring islands " . Martino also intervened to stop the slave trade carried out by the Genoese of Alexandria , for which he was praised by Pope John XXII , who in exchange granted him the right to export <unk> to Egypt , and proposed that the Zaccaria be given command of the Latin fleets in the Aegean . 
 Martino 's prestige rose further when he also became one of the most important feudatories in the Principality of Achaea . Shortly after 1316 , he bought the rights to the Barony of <unk> from <unk> of Rans , although in a document of 1324 it appears that he possessed only half of it , the other being held by Peter dalle Carceri . Martino added to his domains when he married Jacqueline de la Roche , related to the De la Roche dukes of Athens and heiress of the Barony of Veligosti – Damala . Martino 's elevated standing was now recognized by Philip II , titular Latin emperor of Constantinople , who in 1325 named him " King and Despot of Asia Minor " and gave him as fiefs the islands of Chios , Samos , Kos , and Lesbos — which formed part of the Latin emperors ' personal domain by the Treaty of Viterbo — as well as <unk> , Tenedos , <unk> and Marmara Island . This award was mostly symbolic , as except for the first three , which the Zaccaria already controlled , the others were in the hands of the Byzantines or the Turks . In exchange , Martino promised to aid with 500 horsemen in Philip 's hoped @-@ for , but never to be realized , expedition to recover Constantinople from the Byzantines . 
 = = = Byzantine recovery of Chios = = = 
 If these ties to the Latin Emperor provoked displeasure at the Byzantine court , for the time being relations remained good : the lease of Chios was renewed in 1324 , and in 1327 Martino took part in alliance negotiations between the Byzantines and the Republic of Venice . At the same time , however , Martino 's behaviour became increasingly assertive : ca . 1325 he ousted his brother as co @-@ ruler of Chios and began minting coins in his own name . In 1328 , the rise of a new and energetic emperor , Andronikos III Palaiologos , to the Byzantine throne , marked a turning @-@ point in relations . One of the leading Chian nobles , Leo <unk> , went to meet the new emperor and his chief minister , John Kantakouzenos , to propose a reconquest of the island . Andronikos III readily agreed . On the pretext of Martino 's unauthorized building of a new fortress on the island , the emperor sent him a letter in which he ordered him to cease construction , and to present himself in Constantinople in the next year in order to renew the island 's lease . Martino haughtily rejected the demands and accelerated construction , but now his deposed brother Benedetto lodged a complaint with the emperor claiming the one @-@ half share of the island 's revenues that was his due . With these events as an excuse , in autumn 1329 Andronikos III assembled a fleet of 105 vessels — including the forces of the Latin Duke of Naxos , Nicholas I Sanudo — and sailed to Chios . 
 Even after the imperial fleet reached the island , Andronikos III offered to let Martino keep his possessions in exchange for the installation of a Byzantine garrison and the payment of an annual tribute , but Martino refused . He sank his three galleys in the harbour , forbade the Greek population to bear arms and locked himself with 800 men in his citadel , where he raised his own banner instead of the emperor 's . His will to resist was broken , however , when Benedetto surrendered his own fort to the Byzantines , and when he saw the locals welcoming them , he was soon forced to surrender . The emperor spared his life , even though the Chians demanded his execution , and took him prisoner to Constantinople . Martino 's wife and relatives were allowed to go free with their movable wealth , while most of the Zaccaria adherents chose to stay on the island as imperial officials . Benedetto was offered the island 's governorship , but he obstinately demanded to receive it as a personal possession in the same way as his brother had held it , a concession the emperor was unwilling to grant . Benedetto retired to the Genoese colony of Galata , from where a few years later he made an unsuccessful attempt to reclaim Chios ; he died soon after . Andronikos III appointed <unk> as the new governor of Chios , and followed up his success by sailing to Phocaea , forcing it to acknowledge his suzerainty . 
 = = = Later life and the <unk> crusade = = = 
 Martino was released in 1337 at the intercession of the Pope and Philip VI of France , and was offered a military command and some castles by the emperor as compensation . He then returned to his hometown , Genoa , and was named the city 's ambassador to the Holy See . In September 1343 , he was appointed to command the four papal galleys in the crusade against Umur Bey , under the overall command of the titular Latin Patriarch of Constantinople , Henry of Asti . In view of Zaccaria 's character , the Pope expressly warned Henry of Asti not to allow him to divert the crusade in a bid to recover Chios , and authorized Henry to replace Zaccaria if he deemed it necessary . The crusade scored a swift and unexpected success : Umur Bey was caught off guard , and the crusaders recaptured the lower town of Smyrna on 28 October 1344 . The citadel remained in Turkish hands , however , and the crusaders ' position remained precarious . With Venetian aid , they fortified the lower town to enable them to resist Umur 's counterattack . The emir bombarded the lower town with mangonels , but the crusaders managed to sortie and destroy them , effectively breaking the siege . To celebrate this feat , Henry of Asti decided , against the advice of the other crusader leaders , to hold mass in the city 's former cathedral , which lay in the no @-@ man 's @-@ land between the citadel and the crusader @-@ held lower town . The Turks attacked during the service , on 17 January 1345 , and killed Zaccaria , Henry of Asti and other crusader leaders present . 
 = = Family = = 
 Martino Zaccaria married , probably some time before 1325 , Jacqueline de la Roche . An earlier conjecture of Karl Hopf about a first marriage to a daughter of George I Ghisi , heir to the lordship of Tinos and Mykonos , has since been discarded . 
 From his marriage , Martino had two sons : 
 Bartolommeo Zaccaria ( died 1334 ) . By right of his wife , he was Margrave of Bodonitsa . 
 Centurione I Zaccaria ( died 1382 ) . As the sole surviving son , he inherited his father 's fiefs in Morea in 1345 . He founded the family 's <unk> line , which eventually ascended to the princely title of Achaea under Maria II Zaccaria and Centurione II Zaccaria .

 = = Plot = = 
 Ike is terrified by frequent encounters with the ghosts of recently deceased celebrities . He is haunted by people such as Farrah Fawcett , David Carradine , Ed McMahon , DJ AM , and especially Billy Mays , who repeatedly tries selling Ike products from the afterlife . Kyle is terrified when he finds out about the ghost his brother is encountering and tells Stan , Cartman and Kenny about the encounters . Cartman , who does not initially care , decides to help when Kyle mentions that one of the ghosts haunting Ike is Billy Mays . Cartman then shows commercials that feature Mays on television , implying that he is an enthusiastic supporter of a product which Mays promoted , called " <unk> " , which cleans bloodstains from people 's underwear caused by eating food from Chipotle Mexican Grill . The boys call the team from the reality television series Ghost Hunters in to help , but they quickly , fearfully start ascribing supernatural meaning to random , ambient , environmental noises , before urinating and defecating on themselves , and finally running from the house . Eventually , Ike goes into a coma because of his multiple experiences with the ghosts . 
 The boys seek help from a medium ( a parody of Zelda Rubinstein 's character in Poltergeist ) , who explains the celebrities are trapped in purgatory , which she compares to being stuck on a plane waiting endlessly on a runway for permission to take off . The medium manages to contact the spirits and tell them that they have passed on . Much to her surprise , the celebrities say that they all accept the fact . Two deceased celebrities , CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite and Patrick Swayze , tell her that Michael Jackson 's refusal to acknowledge his death is the main cause of them being trapped . Some of the celebrities help the medium and the boys try to convince Jackson that he is dead , but Jackson keeps denying it and insists he is not only alive , but also a little white girl . His denial is so strong that he emits a very powerful force which kills the medium by flinging her through the window of Ike 's hospital room . The ghosts of these annoyed celebrities are shown in purgatory , which resembles the interior of an airplane , complete with seats , flight attendants and pilot voice @-@ over announcements . 
 After the energy disturbance , Jackson 's spirit takes over Ike 's body , causing Ike to speak , sing and dance like Jackson himself . The boys find from online research that the only way to make Jackson accept his death is to make him experience the acceptance he sought in life , so they take him to a child beauty pageant for young girls . Dressed like a little girl , Ike / Jackson impresses two of the male judges by singing a tune sounding similar to Jackson 's " You Are Not Alone , " but they are promptly arrested for masturbating while watching the children , leaving a single , unimpressed female judge ( much to the shock of the boys , who were unaware of the men 's lewd acts and considered them the best judges ) . When Cartman notices the judge eating Chipotle , he bribes her with knowledge about the <unk> product , and she declares Ike / Jackson the winner as a result . One of the other contestants is physically beaten by her mother for losing . Having found his acceptance , Jackson leaves Ike 's body , and Ike is extremely surprised and disgusted to find himself dressed like a little girl . 
 Later on , Jackson and the other celebrities in purgatory are reunited and they are finally able to lift off . Initially happy , they are soon taken to Hell . To their annoyance , however , the flight attendant tells them that they must again wait as Hell is a tow gate .

It featured a frightened Ike standing above the phrase , " I see dead celebrities " . 
 " Dead Celebrities " includes references to several actors , singers and other celebrities who died in the summer of 2009 , when the thirteenth season of South Park was on a mid @-@ season hiatus . The episode serves not only to parody the celebrities themselves , but also to provide commentary on the tendency of American media to exploit , <unk> and excessively report on the lives of celebrities . The most prominently featured of these celebrities is pop singer Michael Jackson , who died of multiple drug intoxication on June 25 . 
 Billy Mays , a television advertisement salesman , is the first dead celebrity featured in the episode , and plays a large role in the early part of the script . Mays ' son , Billy Mays III , a self @-@ proclaimed South Park fan , said he loved " Dead Celebrities " , and found its portrayal of his father tasteful and respectful . He said , " South Park gets a little edgy sometimes , but at their core , they 're just social satire , you know ?

 " Dead Celebrities " makes frequent mention of the Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant chain , describing the food as extremely tasty , but claiming it resulted in bloody stool . Shortly after the episode first aired , a Chipotle spokesperson said via a Twitter message that the claim was false . In the episode 's commentary , Trey Parker and Matt Stone admitted that they loved Chipotle , but found it funnier to use a restaurant with a healthy reputation rather than a place like McDonald 's or Taco Bell . Ike 's ability to see the spirits of dead celebrities serves as a parody of the 1999 thriller film The Sixth Sense , which stars Haley Joel Osment as a young boy who can see ghosts . Ike 's line , " I see dead celebrities " , is a reference to that film 's most famous line , " I see dead people . " The old lady psychic with a very high @-@ pitched voice is a reference to the character played by Zelda Rubinstein in the 1982 horror film , Poltergeist .

 The episode received generally mixed reviews . <unk> Isler of IGN called " Dead Celebrities " one of the best episodes of the season , adding the jokes at the expense of the deceased were not too tasteless . He praised the parodies of The Sixth Sense , Poltergeist and Ghost Hunters , but said some jokes , like the masturbating judges at the children 's beauty contest , were offensive and unfunny . Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson , stars of Ghost Hunters , declared that " far from being offended or incensed [ ... ] they loved being made fun of alongside Michael Jackson and Billy Mays . Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine said " Dead Celebrities " was an especially funny episode that also featured a " <unk> of story " that was well @-@ timed for the Halloween season . Josh Modell of The A.V.

Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said the episode was in bad taste , but added , " I laughed until I choked " . Tucker described the Michael Jackson impersonation as " first @-@ rate " and felt the solution to freeing Jackson 's spirit served as " a ruthless parody of child beauty pageants " . 
 <unk> Ratledge of TV Guide favorably described the episode as the exact opposite of award show segments that reverentially pay homage to the year 's departed celebrities , calling it " a wonderfully tasteless farewell . " Sue <unk> , an arts and celebrity writer with Examiner.com , called " Dead Celebrities " a " new low " for South Park , adding " It 's not only tasteless but this episode just adds to the sadness currently experienced by all the mourning relatives .

 = Spider = 
 Spiders ( order Araneae ) are air @-@ breathing arthropods that have eight legs and chelicerae with fangs that inject venom . They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all other orders of organisms . Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica , and have become established in nearly every habitat with the exceptions of air and sea colonization . As of November 2015 , at least 45 @,@ 700 spider species , and 114 families have been recorded by taxonomists . However , there has been dissension within the scientific community as to how all these families should be classified , as evidenced by the over 20 different classifications that have been proposed since 1900 . 
 Anatomically , spiders differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata , the cephalothorax and abdomen , and joined by a small , cylindrical pedicel . Unlike insects , spiders do not have antennae . In all except the most primitive group , the Mesothelae , spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods , as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax . Unlike most arthropods , spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure . 
 Their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of glands . Spider webs vary widely in size , shape and the amount of sticky thread used . It now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms , and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb @-@ web spiders . Spider @-@ like arachnids with silk @-@ producing spigots appeared in the Devonian period about 386 million years ago , but these animals apparently lacked spinnerets . True spiders have been found in Carboniferous rocks from 318 to 299 million years ago , and are very similar to the most primitive surviving suborder , the Mesothelae . The main groups of modern spiders , Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae , first appeared in the Triassic period , before 200 million years ago . 
 A herbivorous species , Bagheera kiplingi , was described in 2008 , but all other known species are predators , mostly preying on insects and on other spiders , although a few large species also take birds and lizards . Spiders use a wide range of strategies to capture prey : trapping it in sticky webs , lassoing it with sticky bolas , mimicking the prey to avoid detection , or running it down . Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations , but the active hunters have acute vision , and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones . Spiders ' guts are too narrow to take solids , and they liquefy their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes and grinding it with the bases of their pedipalps , as they do not have true jaws . 
 Male spiders identify themselves by a variety of complex courtship rituals to avoid being eaten by the females . Males of most species survive a few matings , limited mainly by their short life spans . Females weave silk egg @-@ cases , each of which may contain hundreds of eggs . Females of many species care for their young , for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them . A minority of species are social , building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50 @,@ 000 individuals . Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration , as in the widow spiders , to co @-@ operative hunting and food @-@ sharing . Although most spiders live for at most two years , tarantulas and other <unk> spiders can live up to 25 years in captivity . 
 While the venom of a few species is dangerous to humans , scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non @-@ polluting pesticides . Spider silk provides a combination of lightness , strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials , and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these can be used as silk factories . As a result of their wide range of behaviors , spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience , cruelty and creative powers . An abnormal fear of spiders is called arachnophobia . 
 = = Description = = 
 = = = Body plan = = = 
 Spiders are chelicerates and therefore arthropods . As arthropods they have : segmented bodies with jointed limbs , all covered in a cuticle made of chitin and proteins ; heads that are composed of several segments that fuse during the development of the embryo . Being chelicerates , their bodies consist of two tagmata , sets of segments that serve similar functions : the foremost one , called the cephalothorax or prosoma , is a complete fusion of the segments that in an insect would form two separate tagmata , the head and thorax ; the rear tagma is called the abdomen or opisthosoma . In spiders , the cephalothorax and abdomen are connected by a small cylindrical section , the pedicel . The pattern of segment fusion that forms chelicerates ' heads is unique among arthropods , and what would normally be the first head segment disappears at an early stage of development , so that chelicerates lack the antennae typical of most arthropods . In fact , chelicerates ' only appendages ahead of the mouth are a pair of chelicerae , and they lack anything that would function directly as " jaws " . The first appendages behind the mouth are called pedipalps , and serve different functions within different groups of chelicerates . 
 Spiders and scorpions are members of one chelicerate group , the arachnids . Scorpions ' chelicerae have three sections and are used in feeding . Spiders ' chelicerae have two sections and terminate in fangs that are generally venomous , and fold away behind the upper sections while not in use . The upper sections generally have thick " beards " that filter solid lumps out of their food , as spiders can take only liquid food . Scorpions ' pedipalps generally form large claws for capturing prey , while those of spiders are fairly small appendages whose bases also act as an extension of the mouth ; in addition , those of male spiders have enlarged last sections used for sperm transfer . 
 In spiders , the cephalothorax and abdomen are joined by a small , cylindrical pedicel , which enables the abdomen to move independently when producing silk . The upper surface of the cephalothorax is covered by a single , convex carapace , while the underside is covered by two rather flat plates . The abdomen is soft and egg @-@ shaped . It shows no sign of segmentation , except that the primitive Mesothelae , whose living members are the Liphistiidae , have segmented plates on the upper surface . 
 = = = Circulation and respiration = = = 
 Like other arthropods , spiders are coelomates in which the coelom is reduced to small areas round the reproductive and excretory systems . Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel , a cavity that runs most of the length of the body and through which blood flows . The heart is a tube in the upper part of the body , with a few ostia that act as non @-@ return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end . However , in spiders , it occupies only the upper part of the abdomen , and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the rear end of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax . Hence spiders have open circulatory systems . The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient . 
 Spiders have developed several different respiratory anatomies , based on book lungs , a tracheal system , or both . <unk> and Mesothelae spiders have two pairs of book lungs filled with haemolymph , where openings on the ventral surface of the abdomen allow air to enter and diffuse oxygen . This is also the case for some basal <unk> spiders , like the family <unk> , but the remaining members of this group have just the anterior pair of book lungs intact while the posterior pair of breathing organs are partly or fully modified into tracheae , through which oxygen is diffused into the haemolymph or directly to the tissue and organs . The trachea system has most likely evolved in small ancestors to help resist desiccation . The trachea were originally connected to the surroundings through a pair of openings called spiracles , but in the majority of spiders this pair of spiracles has fused into a single one in the middle , and moved backwards close to the spinnerets . Spiders that have tracheae generally have higher metabolic rates and better water conservation . Spiders are ectotherms , so environmental temperatures affect their activity . 
 = = = Feeding , digestion and excretion = = = 
 Uniquely among chelicerates , the final sections of spiders ' chelicerae are fangs , and the great majority of spiders can use them to inject venom into prey from venom glands in the roots of the chelicerae . The family Uloboridae has lost its venom glands , and kills its prey with silk instead . Like most arachnids , including scorpions , spiders have a narrow gut that can only cope with liquid food and spiders have two sets of filters to keep solids out . They use one of two different systems of external digestion . Some pump digestive enzymes from the midgut into the prey and then suck the liquified tissues of the prey into the gut , eventually leaving behind the empty husk of the prey . Others grind the prey to pulp using the chelicerae and the bases of the pedipalps , while flooding it with enzymes ; in these species , the chelicerae and the bases of the pedipalps form a preoral cavity that holds the food they are processing . 
 The stomach in the cephalothorax acts as a pump that sends the food deeper into the digestive system . The mid gut bears many digestive ceca , compartments with no other exit , that extract nutrients from the food ; most are in the abdomen , which is dominated by the digestive system , but a few are found in the cephalothorax . 
 Most spiders convert nitrogenous waste products into uric acid , which can be excreted as a dry material . <unk> tubules ( " little tubes " ) extract these wastes from the blood in the hemocoel and dump them into the cloacal chamber , from which they are expelled through the anus . Production of uric acid and its removal via <unk> tubules are a water @-@ conserving feature that has evolved independently in several arthropod lineages that can live far away from water , for example the tubules of insects and arachnids develop from completely different parts of the embryo . However , a few primitive spiders , the sub @-@ order Mesothelae and infra @-@ order Mygalomorphae , retain the ancestral arthropod nephridia ( " little kidneys " ) , which use large amounts of water to excrete nitrogenous waste products as ammonia . 
 = = = Central nervous system = = = 
 The basic arthropod central nervous system consists of a pair of nerve cords running below the gut , with paired ganglia as local control centers in all segments ; a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia for the head segments ahead of and behind the mouth , so that the esophagus is encircled by this conglomeration of ganglia . Except for the primitive Mesothelae , of which the Liphistiidae are the sole surviving family , spiders have the much more centralized nervous system that is typical of arachnids : all the ganglia of all segments behind the esophagus are fused , so that the cephalothorax is largely filled with nervous tissue and there are no ganglia in the abdomen ; in the Mesothelae , the ganglia of the abdomen and the rear part of the cephalothorax remain unfused . 
 Despite the relatively small central nervous system , some spiders ( like Portia ) exhibit complex behaviour , including the ability to use a trial @-@ and @-@ error approach . 
 = = = Sense organs = = = 
 = = = = Eyes = = = = 
 Most spiders have four pairs of eyes on the top @-@ front area of the cephalothorax , arranged in patterns that vary from one family to another . The pair at the front are of the type called pigment @-@ cup ocelli ( " little eyes " ) , which in most arthropods are only capable of detecting the direction from which light is coming , using the shadow cast by the walls of the cup . However , the main eyes at the front of spiders ' heads are pigment @-@ cup ocelli that are capable of forming images . The other eyes are thought to be derived from the compound eyes of the ancestral chelicerates , but no longer have the separate facets typical of compound eyes . Unlike the main eyes , in many spiders these secondary eyes detect light reflected from a reflective tapetum lucidum , and wolf spiders can be spotted by torch light reflected from the <unk> . On the other hand , jumping spiders ' secondary eyes have no <unk> . Some jumping spiders ' visual acuity exceeds by a factor of ten that of dragonflies , which have by far the best vision among insects ; in fact the human eye is only about five times sharper than a jumping spider 's . They achieve this by a telephoto @-@ like series of lenses , a four @-@ layer retina and the ability to swivel their eyes and integrate images from different stages in the scan . The downside is that the scanning and integrating processes are relatively slow . 
 There are spiders with a reduced number of eyes , of these those with six @-@ eyes are the most numerous and are missing a pair of eyes on the anterior median line , others species have four @-@ eyes and some just two . Cave dwelling species have no eyes , or possess vestigial eyes incapable of sight . 
 = = = = Other senses = = = = 
 As with other arthropods , spiders ' cuticles would block out information about the outside world , except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system . In fact , spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors . Various touch sensors , mostly bristles called setae , respond to different levels of force , from strong contact to very weak air currents . Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell , often by means of setae . <unk> carry a large number of such setae sensitive to contact chemicals and air @-@ borne smells , such as female pheromones . Spiders also have in the joints of their limbs slit sensillae that detect forces and vibrations . In web @-@ building spiders , all these mechanical and chemical sensors are more important than the eyes , while the eyes are most important to spiders that hunt actively . 
 Like most arthropods , spiders lack balance and acceleration sensors and rely on their eyes to tell them which way is up . Arthropods ' <unk> , sensors that report the force exerted by muscles and the degree of bending in the body and joints , are well understood . On the other hand , little is known about what other internal sensors spiders or other arthropods may have . 
 = = = Locomotion = = = 
 Each of the eight legs of a spider consists of seven distinct parts . The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa ; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment , the femur ; next is the spider 's knee , the patella , which acts as the hinge for the tibia ; the metatarsus is next , and it connects the tibia to the tarsus ( which may be thought of as a foot of sorts ) ; the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points , depending on the family to which the spider belongs . Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs , spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them , a system inherited from their pre @-@ arthropod ancestors . The only extensor muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints ( bordering the coxa and the trochanter ) . As a result , a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs , and the legs of dead spiders curl up . Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs , and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs . Although larger spiders use hydraulics to straighten their legs , unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps . 
 Most spiders that hunt actively , rather than relying on webs , have dense tufts of fine hairs between the paired claws at the tips of their legs . These tufts , known as scopulae , consist of bristles whose ends are split into as many as 1 @,@ 000 branches , and enable spiders with scopulae to walk up vertical glass and upside down on ceilings . It appears that scopulae get their grip from contact with extremely thin layers of water on surfaces . Spiders , like most other arachnids , keep at least four legs on the surface while walking or running . 
 = = = Silk production = = = 
 The abdomen has no appendages except those that have been modified to form one to four ( usually three ) pairs of short , movable spinnerets , which emit silk . Each spinneret has many spigots , each of which is connected to one silk gland . There are at least six types of silk gland , each producing a different type of silk . 
 Silk is mainly composed of a protein very similar to that used in insect silk . It is initially a liquid , and hardens not by exposure to air but as a result of being drawn out , which changes the internal structure of the protein . It is similar in tensile strength to nylon and biological materials such as chitin , collagen and cellulose , but is much more elastic . In other words , it can stretch much further before breaking or losing shape . 
 Some spiders have a cribellum , a modified spinneret with up to 40 @,@ 000 spigots , each of which produces a single very fine fiber . The fibers are pulled out by the <unk> , a comb @-@ like set of bristles on the jointed tip of the cribellum , and combined into a composite woolly thread that is very effective in snagging the bristles of insects . The earliest spiders had <unk> , which produced the first silk capable of capturing insects , before spiders developed silk coated with sticky droplets . However , most modern groups of spiders have lost the cribellum . 
 Tarantulas also have silk glands in their feet . 
 Even species that do not build webs to catch prey use silk in several ways : as wrappers for sperm and for fertilized eggs ; as a " safety rope " ; for nest @-@ building ; and as " parachutes " by the young of some species . 
 = = = Reproduction and life cycle = = = 
 Spiders reproduce sexually and fertilization is internal but indirect , in other words the sperm is not inserted into the female 's body by the male 's genitals but by an intermediate stage . Unlike many land @-@ living arthropods , male spiders do not produce ready @-@ made spermatophores ( packages of sperm ) , but spin small sperm webs on to which they ejaculate and then transfer the sperm to special syringe @-@ like structures , palpal bulbs or palpal organs , borne on the tips of the pedipalps of mature males . When a male detects signs of a female nearby he checks whether she is of the same species and whether she is ready to mate ; for example in species that produce webs or " safety ropes " , the male can identify the species and sex of these objects by " smell " . 
 Spiders generally use elaborate courtship rituals to prevent the large females from eating the small males before fertilization , except where the male is so much smaller that he is not worth eating . In web @-@ weaving species , precise patterns of vibrations in the web are a major part of the rituals , while patterns of touches on the female 's body are important in many spiders that hunt actively , and may " hypnotize " the female . Gestures and dances by the male are important for jumping spiders , which have excellent eyesight . If courtship is successful , the male injects his sperm from the palpal bulbs into the female 's genital opening , known as the <unk> , on the underside of her abdomen . Female 's reproductive tracts vary from simple tubes to systems that include seminal receptacles in which females store sperm and release it when they are ready . 
 Males of the genus <unk> amputate one of their palps before maturation and enter adult life with one palp only . The palps are 20 % of male 's body mass in this species , and detaching one of the two improves mobility . In the Yemeni species <unk> <unk> , the remaining palp is then torn off by the female . The separated palp remains attached to the female 's <unk> for about four hours and apparently continues to function independently . In the meantime , the female feeds on the <unk> male . In over 60 % of cases , the female of the Australian redback spider kills and eats the male after it inserts its second palp into the female 's genital opening ; in fact , the males co @-@ operate by trying to impale themselves on the females ' fangs . Observation shows that most male redbacks never get an opportunity to mate , and the " lucky " ones increase the likely number of offspring by ensuring that the females are well @-@ fed . However , males of most species survive a few matings , limited mainly by their short life spans . Some even live for a while in their mates ' webs . 
 Females lay up to 3 @,@ 000 eggs in one or more silk egg sacs , which maintain a fairly constant humidity level . In some species , the females die afterwards , but females of other species protect the sacs by attaching them to their webs , hiding them in nests , carrying them in the chelicerae or attaching them to the spinnerets and dragging them along . 
 Baby spiders pass all their larval stages inside the egg and hatch as spiderlings , very small and sexually immature but similar in shape to adults . Some spiders care for their young , for example a wolf spider 's brood cling to rough bristles on the mother 's back , and females of some species respond to the " begging " behaviour of their young by giving them their prey , provided it is no longer struggling , or even regurgitate food . 
 Like other arthropods , spiders have to molt to grow as their cuticle ( " skin " ) cannot stretch . In some species males mate with newly molted females , which are too weak to be dangerous to the males . Most spiders live for only one to two years , although some tarantulas can live in captivity for over 20 years . 
 = = = Size = = = 
 Spiders occur in a large range of sizes . The smallest , <unk> <unk> from Colombia , are less than 0 @.@ 37 mm ( 0 @.@ 015 in ) in body length . The largest and heaviest spiders occur among tarantulas , which can have body lengths up to 90 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) and leg spans up to 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) . 
 = = = Coloration = = = 
 Only three classes of pigment ( <unk> , <unk> and guanine ) have been identified in spiders , although other pigments have been detected but not yet characterized . <unk> , carotenoids and <unk> , very common in other animals , are apparently absent . In some species , the exocuticle of the legs and prosoma is modified by a tanning process , resulting in brown coloration . <unk> are found , for example , in <unk> virescens , resulting in its green color . <unk> is responsible for the white markings of the European garden spider <unk> <unk> . It is in many species accumulated in specialized cells called <unk> . In genera such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , guanine creates their silvery appearance . While guanine is originally an end @-@ product of protein metabolism , its excretion can be blocked in spiders , leading to an increase in its storage . Structural colors occur in some species , which are the result of the diffraction , scattering or interference of light , for example by modified setae or scales . The white prosoma of Argiope results from hairs reflecting the light , <unk> and <unk> both have areas of modified cuticle that act as light reflectors . 
 = = Ecology and behavior = = 
 = = = Non @-@ predatory feeding = = = 
 Although spiders are generally regarded as predatory , the jumping spider Bagheera kiplingi gets over 90 % of its food from fairly solid plant material produced by acacias as part of a mutually beneficial relationship with a species of ant . 
 Juveniles of some spiders in the families <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Salticidae feed on plant nectar . Laboratory studies show that they do so deliberately and over extended periods , and periodically clean themselves while feeding . These spiders also prefer sugar solutions to plain water , which indicates that they are seeking nutrients . Since many spiders are nocturnal , the extent of nectar consumption by spiders may have been underestimated . Nectar contains amino acids , lipids , vitamins and minerals in addition to sugars , and studies have shown that other spider species live longer when nectar is available . Feeding on nectar avoids the risks of struggles with prey , and the costs of producing venom and digestive enzymes . 
 Various species are known to feed on dead arthropods ( scavenging ) , web silk , and their own shed exoskeletons . Pollen caught in webs may also be eaten , and studies have shown that young spiders have a better chance of survival if they have the opportunity to eat pollen . In captivity , several spider species are also known to feed on bananas , marmalade , milk , egg yolk and sausages . 
 = = = Methods of capturing prey = = = 
 The best @-@ known method of prey capture is by means of sticky webs . Varying placement of webs allows different species of spider to trap different insects in the same area , for example flat horizontal webs trap insects that fly up from vegetation underneath while flat vertical webs trap insects in horizontal flight . Web @-@ building spiders have poor vision , but are extremely sensitive to vibrations . 
 Females of the water spider <unk> aquatica build underwater " diving bell " webs that they fill with air and use for digesting prey , molting , mating and raising offspring . They live almost entirely within the bells , darting out to catch prey animals that touch the bell or the threads that anchor it . A few spiders use the surfaces of lakes and ponds as " webs " , detecting trapped insects by the vibrations that these cause while struggling . 
 Net @-@ casting spiders weave only small webs , but then manipulate them to trap prey . Those of the genus <unk> and the family <unk> stretch their webs and then release them when prey strike them , but do not actively move their webs . Those of the family <unk> weave even smaller webs , hold them outstretched between their first two pairs of legs , and lunge and push the webs as much as twice their own body length to trap prey , and this move may increase the webs ' area by a factor of up to ten . Experiments have shown that <unk> spinosus has two different techniques for trapping prey : backwards strikes to catch flying insects , whose vibrations it detects ; and forward strikes to catch ground @-@ walking prey that it sees . These two techniques have also been observed in other <unk> . Walking insects form most of the prey of most <unk> , but one population of <unk> <unk> appears to live mainly on <unk> flies that they catch with the backwards strike . 
 Mature female bolas spiders of the genus <unk> build " webs " that consist of only a single " trapeze line " , which they patrol . They also construct a bolas made of a single thread , tipped with a large ball of very wet sticky silk . They emit chemicals that resemble the pheromones of moths , and then swing the bolas at the moths . Although they miss on about 50 % of strikes , they catch about the same weight of insects per night as web @-@ weaving spiders of similar size . The spiders eat the bolas if they have not made a kill in about 30 minutes , rest for a while , and then make new bolas . Juveniles and adult males are much smaller and do not make bolas . Instead they release different pheromones that attract moth flies , and catch them with their front pairs of legs . 
 The primitive Liphistiidae , the " trapdoor spiders " of the family <unk> and many tarantulas are ambush predators that lurk in burrows , often closed by trapdoors and often surrounded by networks of silk threads that alert these spiders to the presence of prey . Other ambush predators do without such aids , including many crab spiders , and a few species that prey on bees , which see ultraviolet , can adjust their ultraviolet reflectance to match the flowers in which they are lurking . Wolf spiders , jumping spiders , fishing spiders and some crab spiders capture prey by chasing it , and rely mainly on vision to locate prey . 
 Some jumping spiders of the genus Portia hunt other spiders in ways that seem intelligent , outflanking their victims or luring them from their webs . Laboratory studies show that Portia 's instinctive tactics are only starting points for a trial @-@ and @-@ error approach from which these spiders learn very quickly how to overcome new prey species . However , they seem to be relatively slow " thinkers " , which is not surprising , as their brains are vastly smaller than those of mammalian predators . 
 Ant @-@ mimicking spiders face several challenges : they generally develop slimmer abdomens and false " waists " in the cephalothorax to mimic the three distinct regions ( tagmata ) of an ant 's body ; they wave the first pair of legs in form to their heads to mimic antennae , which spiders lack , and to conceal the fact that they have eight legs rather than six ; they develop large color patches round one pair of eyes to disguise the fact that they generally have eight simple eyes , while ants have two compound eyes ; they cover their bodies with reflective hairs to resemble the shiny bodies of ants . In some spider species , males and females mimic different ant species , as female spiders are usually much larger than males . Ant @-@ mimicking spiders also modify their behavior to resemble that of the target species of ant ; for example , many adopt a zig @-@ zag pattern of movement , ant @-@ mimicking jumping spiders avoid jumping , and spiders of the genus <unk> walk on the outer edges of leaves in the same way as Pseudomyrmex . Ant @-@ mimicry in many spiders and other arthropods may be for protection from predators that hunt by sight , including birds , lizards and spiders . However , several ant @-@ mimicking spiders prey either on ants or on the ants ' " livestock " , such as aphids . When at rest , the ant @-@ mimicking crab spider <unk> does not closely resemble Oecophylla , but while hunting it imitates the behavior of a dying ant to attract worker ants . After a kill , some ant @-@ mimicking spiders hold their victims between themselves and large groups of ants to avoid being attacked . 
 = = = Defense = = = 
 There is strong evidence that spiders ' coloration is camouflage that helps them to evade their major predators , birds and parasitic wasps , both of which have good color vision . Many spider species are colored so as to merge with their most common backgrounds , and some have disruptive coloration , stripes and blotches that break up their outlines . In a few species , such as the Hawaiian happy @-@ face spider , Theridion grallator , several coloration schemes are present in a ratio that appears to remain constant , and this may make it more difficult for predators to recognize the species . Most spiders are insufficiently dangerous or unpleasant @-@ tasting for warning coloration to offer much benefit . However , a few species with powerful venoms , large jaws or irritant hairs have patches of warning colors , and some actively display these colors when threatened . 
 Many of the family <unk> , which includes tarantulas and baboon spiders , have urticating hairs on their abdomens and use their legs to flick them at attackers . These hairs are fine setae ( bristles ) with fragile bases and a row of barbs on the tip . The barbs cause intense irritation but there is no evidence that they carry any kind of venom . A few defend themselves against wasps by including networks of very robust threads in their webs , giving the spider time to flee while the wasps are struggling with the obstacles . The golden wheeling spider , <unk> <unk> , of the Namibian desert escapes parasitic wasps by flipping onto its side and cartwheeling down sand dunes . 
 = = = Social spiders = = = 
 A few spider species that build webs live together in large colonies and show social behavior , although not as complex as in social insects . Anelosimus eximius ( in the family Theridiidae ) can form colonies of up to 50 @,@ 000 individuals . The genus Anelosimus has a strong tendency towards sociality : all known American species are social , and species in Madagascar are at least somewhat social . Members of other species in the same family but several different genera have independently developed social behavior . For example , although Theridion <unk> belongs to a genus with no other social species , T. <unk> build colonies that may contain several thousand individuals that co @-@ operate in prey capture and share food . Other communal spiders include several Philoponella species ( family Uloboridae ) , <unk> <unk> ( family <unk> ) and <unk> <unk> ( family <unk> ) . Social predatory spiders need to defend their prey against kleptoparasites ( " thieves " ) , and larger colonies are more successful in this . The herbivorous spider Bagheera kiplingi lives in small colonies which help to protect eggs and spiderlings . Even widow spiders ( genus Latrodectus ) , which are notoriously cannibalistic , have formed small colonies in captivity , sharing webs and feeding together . 
 = = Web types = = 
 There is no consistent relationship between the classification of spiders and the types of web they build : species in the same genus may build very similar or significantly different webs . Nor is there much correspondence between spiders ' classification and the chemical composition of their silks . Convergent evolution in web construction , in other words use of similar techniques by remotely related species , is rampant . Orb web designs and the spinning behaviors that produce them are the best understood . The basic radial @-@ then @-@ spiral sequence visible in orb webs and the sense of direction required to build them may have been inherited from the common ancestors of most spider groups . However , the majority of spiders build non @-@ orb webs . It used to be thought that the sticky orb web was an evolutionary innovation resulting in the diversification of the <unk> . Now , however , it appears that non @-@ orb spiders are a sub @-@ group that evolved from orb @-@ web spiders , and non @-@ orb spiders have over 40 % more species and are four times as abundant as orb @-@ web spiders . Their greater success may be because <unk> wasps , which are often the dominant predators of spiders , much prefer to attack spiders that have flat webs . 
 = = = Orb webs = = = 
 About half the potential prey that hit orb webs escape . A web has to perform three functions : intercepting the prey ( intersection ) , absorbing its momentum without breaking ( stopping ) , and trapping the prey by entangling it or sticking to it ( retention ) . No single design is best for all prey . For example : wider spacing of lines will increase the web 's area and hence its ability to intercept prey , but reduce its stopping power and retention ; closer spacing , larger sticky droplets and thicker lines would improve retention , but would make it easier for potential prey to see and avoid the web , at least during the day . However , there are no consistent differences between orb webs built for use during the day and those built for use at night . In fact , there is no simple relationship between orb web design features and the prey they capture , as each orb @-@ weaving species takes a wide range of prey . 
 The hubs of orb webs , where the spiders lurk , are usually above the center , as the spiders can move downwards faster than upwards . If there is an obvious direction in which the spider can retreat to avoid its own predators , the hub is usually offset towards that direction . 
 Horizontal orb webs are fairly common , despite being less effective at intercepting and retaining prey and more vulnerable to damage by rain and falling debris . Various researchers have suggested that horizontal webs offer compensating advantages , such as reduced vulnerability to wind damage ; reduced visibility to prey flying upwards , because of the back @-@ lighting from the sky ; enabling oscillations to catch insects in slow horizontal flight . However , there is no single explanation for the common use of horizontal orb webs . 
 Spiders often attach highly visible silk bands , called decorations or <unk> , to their webs . Field research suggests that webs with more decorative bands captured more prey per hour . However , a laboratory study showed that spiders reduce the building of these decorations if they sense the presence of predators . 
 There are several unusual variants of orb web , many of them convergently evolved , including : attachment of lines to the surface of water , possibly to trap insects in or on the surface ; webs with twigs through their centers , possibly to hide the spiders from predators ; " ladder @-@ like " webs that appear most effective in catching moths . However , the significance of many variations is unclear . 
 In 1973 , Skylab 3 took two orb @-@ web spiders into space to test their web @-@ spinning capabilities in zero gravity . At first , both produced rather sloppy webs , but they adapted quickly . 
 = = = <unk> spiders ( cobweb spiders ) = = = 
 Members of the family Theridiidae weave irregular , tangled , three @-@ dimensional webs , popularly known as cobwebs . There seems to be an evolutionary trend towards a reduction in the amount of sticky silk used , leading to its total absence in some species . The construction of cobwebs is less stereotyped than that of orb @-@ webs , and may take several days . 
 = = = Other types of webs = = = 
 The <unk> generally make horizontal but uneven sheets , with tangles of stopping threads above . Insects that hit the stopping threads fall onto the sheet or are shaken onto it by the spider , and are held by sticky threads on the sheet until the spider can attack from below .

 = = = Fossil record = = = 
 Although the fossil record of spiders is considered poor , almost 1000 species have been described from fossils . Because spiders ' bodies are quite soft , the vast majority of fossil spiders have been found preserved in amber . The oldest known amber that contains fossil arthropods dates from 130 million years ago in the Early Cretaceous period . In addition to preserving spiders ' anatomy in very fine detail , pieces of amber show spiders mating , killing prey , producing silk and possibly caring for their young . In a few cases , amber has preserved spiders ' egg sacs and webs , occasionally with prey attached ; the oldest fossil web found so far is 100 million years old . Earlier spider fossils come from a few lagerstätten , places where conditions were exceptionally suited to preserving fairly soft tissues . 
 The oldest known exclusively terrestrial arachnid is the trigonotarbid Palaeotarbus jerami , from about 420 million years ago in the Silurian period , and had a triangular cephalothorax and segmented abdomen , as well as eight legs and a pair of pedipalps . Attercopus fimbriunguis , from 386 million years ago in the Devonian period , bears the earliest known silk @-@ producing spigots , and was therefore hailed as a spider at the time of its discovery . However , these spigots may have been mounted on the underside of the abdomen rather than on spinnerets , which are modified appendages and whose mobility is important in the building of webs . Hence Attercopus and the similar Permian arachnid <unk> may not have been true spiders , and probably used silk for lining nests or producing egg @-@ cases rather than for building webs . The largest known fossil spider as of 2011 is the <unk> Nephila jurassica , from about 165 million years ago , recorded from <unk> , Inner Mongolia in China . Its body length is almost 25 mm , ( i.e. , almost one inch ) . 
 Several Carboniferous spiders were members of the Mesothelae , a primitive group now represented only by the Liphistiidae . The <unk> <unk> <unk> , from the Late Carboniferous over 299 million years ago , had five spinnerets . Although the Permian period 299 to 251 million years ago saw rapid diversification of flying insects , there are very few fossil spiders from this period . 
 The main groups of modern spiders , Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae , first appear in the Triassic well before 200 million years ago . Some Triassic mygalomorphs appear to be members of the family <unk> , whose modern members include the notorious Sydney funnel @-@ web spider , and their spinnerets appear adapted for building funnel @-@ shaped webs to catch jumping insects . Araneomorphae account for the great majority of modern spiders , including those that weave the familiar orb @-@ shaped webs . The Jurassic and Cretaceous periods provide a large number of fossil spiders , including representatives of many modern families . 
 = = = Family tree = = = 
 It is now agreed that spiders ( Araneae ) are monophyletic ( i.e. , members of a group of organisms that form a clade , consisting of a last common ancestor and all of its descendants ) . There has been debate about what their closest evolutionary relatives are , and how all of these evolved from the ancestral chelicerates , which were marine animals . The cladogram on the right is based on J. W. Shultz ' analysis ( 2007 ) . Other views include proposals that : scorpions are more closely related to the extinct marine scorpion @-@ like eurypterids than to spiders ; spiders and <unk> are a monophyletic group . The appearance of several multi @-@ way <unk> in the tree on the right shows that there are still uncertainties about relationships between the groups involved . 
 Arachnids lack some features of other chelicerates , including backward @-@ pointing mouths and <unk> ( " jaw bases " ) at the bases of their legs ; both of these features are part of the ancestral arthropod feeding system . Instead , they have mouths that point forwards and downwards , and all have some means of breathing air . Spiders ( Araneae ) are distinguished from other arachnid groups by several characteristics , including spinnerets and , in males , pedipalps that are specially adapted for sperm transfer . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Spiders are divided into two suborders , Mesothelae and <unk> , of which the latter contains two infraorders , Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae . Nearly 46 @,@ 000 living species of spiders ( order Araneae ) have been identified and are currently grouped into about 114 families and about 4 @,@ 000 genera by arachnologists . 
 = = = Mesothelae = = = 
 The only living members of the primitive Mesothelae are the family Liphistiidae , found only in Southeast Asia , China , and Japan . Most of the Liphistiidae construct silk @-@ lined burrows with thin trapdoors , although some species of the genus <unk> build camouflaged silk tubes with a second trapdoor as an emergency exit . Members of the genus <unk> run silk " tripwires " outwards from their tunnels to help them detect approaching prey , while those of genus <unk> do not and instead rely on their built @-@ in vibration sensors . Spiders of the genus <unk> have no venom glands although they do have venom gland outlets on the fang tip . 
 The extinct families <unk> , found in Carboniferous and Permian rocks , and <unk> , so far found only in Carboniferous rocks , have been classified as members of the Mesothelae . 
 = = = Mygalomorphae = = = 
 The Mygalomorphae , which first appeared in the Triassic period , are generally heavily built and hairy , with large , robust chelicerae and fangs . Well @-@ known examples include tarantulas , <unk> trapdoor spiders and the Australasian funnel @-@ web spiders . Most spend the majority of their time in burrows , and some run silk tripwires out from these , but a few build webs to capture prey . However , mygalomorphs cannot produce the <unk> silk that the Araneomorphae use as instant adhesive to glue silk to surfaces or to other strands of silk , and this makes web construction more difficult for mygalomorphs . Since mygalomorphs rarely " balloon " by using air currents for transport , their populations often form clumps . In addition to arthropods , mygalomorphs are capable of preying on frogs , small mammals , lizards , and snails . 
 = = = Araneomorphae = = = 
 In addition to accounting for over 90 % of spider species , the Araneomorphae , also known as the " true spiders " , include orb @-@ web spiders , the cursorial wolf spiders , and jumping spiders , as well as the only known herbivorous spider , Bagheera kiplingi . They are distinguished by having fangs that oppose each other and cross in a pinching action , in contrast to the Mygalomorphae , which have fangs that are nearly parallel in alignment .

Spiders will only bite humans in self @-@ defense , and few produce worse effects than a mosquito bite or bee @-@ sting . Most of those with medically serious bites , such as recluse spiders and widow spiders , would rather flee and bite only when trapped , although this can easily arise by accident . Funnel web spiders ' defensive tactics include fang display and their venom , although they rarely inject much , has resulted in 13 known human deaths over 50 years . They have been deemed to be the world 's most dangerous spiders on clinical and venom toxicity grounds , though this claim has also been attributed to the Brazilian wandering spider , due to much more frequent accidents . 
 There were about 100 reliably reported deaths from spider bites in the 20th century , but about 1 @,@ 500 from jellyfish stings . Many alleged cases of spider bites may represent incorrect diagnoses , which would make it more difficult to check the effectiveness of treatments for genuine bites . 
 = = = Benefits to humans = = = 
 Spider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides , as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to vertebrates . Australian funnel web spiders are a promising source , as most of the world 's insect pests have had no opportunity to develop any immunity to their venom , and funnel web spiders thrive in captivity and are easy to " milk " . It may be possible to target specific pests by engineering genes for the production of spider toxins into viruses that infect species such as cotton <unk> . 
 The Ch 'ol Maya use a beverage created from the tarantula species Brachypelma vagans for the treatment of a condition they term ' tarantula wind ' , the symptoms of which include chest pain , asthma and coughing . 
 Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated , for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia , Alzheimer 's disease , strokes , and erectile dysfunction . The peptide <unk> @-@ 4 , found in the venom of Brachypelma vagans , is being researched to determine whether or not it could effectively be used for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia , muscular dystrophy or glioma . Because spider silk is both light and very strong , attempts are being made to produce it in goats ' milk and in the leaves of plants , by means of genetic engineering . 
 Spiders can also be used as food . Cooked tarantula spiders are considered a delicacy in Cambodia , and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela – provided the highly irritant hairs , the spiders ' main defense system , are removed first . 
 = = = Arachnophobia = = = 
 Arachnophobia is a specific phobia — it is the abnormal fear of spiders or anything reminiscent of spiders , such as webs or spider @-@ like shapes . It is one of the most common specific phobias , and some statistics show that 50 % of women and 10 % of men show symptoms . It may be an exaggerated form of an instinctive response that helped early humans to survive , or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly European societies . 
 = = = Spiders in symbolism and culture = = = 
 Spiders have been the focus of stories and mythologies of various cultures for centuries . They have symbolized patience due to their hunting technique of setting webs and waiting for prey , as well as mischief and malice due to their venomous bites . The Italian tarantella is a dance to rid the young woman of the lustful effects of a spider bite . 
 Web @-@ spinning also caused the association of the spider with creation myths , as they seem to have the ability to produce their own worlds . <unk> are depictions of spiderwebs . The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature . They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted spiders in their art . 
 = Edward Graham Paley = 
 Edward Graham Paley , usually known as E. G. Paley ( 3 September 1823 – 23 January 1895 ) , was an English architect who practised in Lancaster , Lancashire , in the second half of the 19th century . After leaving school in 1838 , he went to Lancaster to become a pupil of Edmund Sharpe , and in 1845 he joined Sharpe as a partner . Sharpe retired from the practice in 1851 , leaving Paley as the sole principal . In 1868 Hubert Austin joined him as a partner , and in 1886 Paley 's son Henry ( who was usually known as Harry ) also became a partner . This partnership continued until Edward Paley 's death in 1895 . 
 Paley 's major work was the design of new churches , but he also rebuilt , restored , and made additions and alterations to existing churches . His major new ecclesiastical design was that of St Peter 's Church , Lancaster , which became Lancaster Cathedral . He also carried out secular commissions , mainly on country houses in the north @-@ west of England . His largest and most important secular work was the Royal Albert Asylum in Lancaster . When designing churches , Paley mainly used the Gothic Revival style , but in his secular works he employed a greater variety of styles , including Tudor Revival and Scottish Baronial as well as Gothic Revival . 
 Paley played little part in the political life of Lancaster , but he was involved with cultural events and sports in the town . His interests included music and archaeology , and he was involved in archery and rowing . In addition to designing the Royal Albert Asylum , he served on its committee , as well as being on the committees of local schools and the Mechanics ' Institute . His work tended to be eclipsed in the later part of his career by Austin , and Paley is regarded as having been a competent architect , rather than a great one . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Edward Paley was born in Easingwold , North Yorkshire , the seventh child and the fourth son of Revd Edmund Paley and Sarah née Apthorp . His father was the local vicar , who in turn was second son of William Paley , the Christian apologist . Edward was initially educated at home , and later at Christ 's Hospital when it was situated in London . From school he went directly to Lancaster in 1838 to become a pupil of the architect Edmund Sharpe at the age of 15 .

 In 1845 , after Paley had completed his articles , Sharpe appointed him as a partner in the practice , which was known as Sharpe and Paley , Architects , ( or more usually as Sharpe & Paley ) . Sharpe then paid more attention to his interests outside the practice , and from 1847 Paley was carrying out most of the work . In 1851 , the year of Paley 's marriage to Sharpe 's sister , Sharpe formally retired from the practice , leaving Paley as sole principal . The practice continued to use the title Sharpe and Paley until 1856 , the year Sharpe moved to North Wales ; the title was then changed to E. G. Paley . In 1860 Paley moved his office from St Leonard 's Gate to 32 Castle Hill ( later 24 Castle Park ) . This building was to serve the practice for the rest of its existence until it closed in 1946 . In 1871 Paley took over the ownership of the building . 
 Between 1845 and 1851 it is difficult to determine how much responsibility each partner took in the commissions undertaken by the practice , but from 1851 it was Paley who was individually responsible . The two partners did work together on the remodelling of Capernwray Hall , and in the rebuilding of All Saints ' Church , Wigan . Throughout Paley 's career , the design of new churches was his major source of work . Between 1851 and 1867 he was responsible for about 36 new or rebuilt churches . During the 1850s his new churches included St Patrick , Preston Patrick , St Peter , Rylstone ( both 1852 – 53 ) , St Anne , Thwaites ( 1853 – 54 ) , Christ Church , Bacup , ( 1854 ) , and St George , Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness ( 1859 – 60 ) . All these churches were Anglican , but in 1857 came a commission for a Roman Catholic church , St Peter , Lancaster , ( which in 1924 became Lancaster Cathedral ) . With its spire rising to 240 feet ( 73 m ) , it is considered to be Paley 's finest design . Later major new churches include St Peter , Quernmore ( 1859 – 60 ) , St Mark , Preston ( 1862 – 63 ) , Holy Trinity , Bury ( 1863 – 64 ) , St James , Poolstock ( 1863 – 66 ) , St James , Barrow ( 1867 – 69 ) , and his most substantial church of this period , St Peter , Bolton ( 1867 – 71 ) . 
 Paley also designed a great variety of secular buildings , the most important of which was the Royal Albert Asylum ( 1868 – 73 ) , the largest building ever undertaken by the practice . He carried out much work on schools , designing town and village schools , and designing extensions for larger schools , including work for Giggleswick School ( 1849 – 51 ) and , for Rossall School , a chapel ( 1861 – 62 ) and a new east wing ( 1867 ) . Paley carried out commissions for country houses , including the rebuilding of Wennington Hall ( 1855 – 56 ) , and a new house , The Ridding in Bentham , North Yorkshire ( 1857 – 60 ) . There was also a variety of smaller works , including a music hall in Settle , cemetery buildings in Lancaster and <unk> , and industrial buildings . Paley 's career coincided with the growth of the town of Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness and the development of the Furness Railway and , being the major architect in the area , he gained many commissions relating to the town and the railway . He developed working relationships with the major entrepreneurs , James Ramsden , and Henry Schneider , for whom he designed both domestic and industrial buildings . An early commission was to convert a former manor house into the Furness Abbey Hotel for the railway ( 1847 – 48 ) . He later designed a large country house for Ramsden , Abbot 's Wood ( 1857 – 59 , since demolished ) . Paley 's first station for the railway was Strand station in Barrow ( 1863 , since demolished ) . Subsequently the practice was to be responsible for most of the buildings required for the railway . 
 = = = 1868 – 95 = = = 
 From 1868 until his death in 1895 Paley worked in partnerships . He was joined by Hubert Austin in 1868 , when the practice became known as Paley and Austin . Paley 's son Henry , usually known as Harry , joined the partnership in 1886 , when the practice became Paley , Austin and Paley , a title it retained until Edward Paley 's death . From 1868 it is difficult to know what part any one partner contributed to any particular project . Almost all the works were attributed to the partnership as a whole , and not to an individual partner . What is certain is that the firm enjoyed its most successful period and designed most of its most admired buildings during these years . New features appeared , including what Brandwood et al. describe as " a new @-@ found muscularity which tended to be uncharacteristic of Paley 's work " . Although Paley had occasionally used Perpendicular features in his churches , these were used much more frequently , so much so that the practice is credited with playing a part in what Brandwood et al. term the " Perpendicular revival in the North " , and even with playing a " nationally pioneering role " in the " rehabilitation of the Perpendicular style as an acceptable stylistic choice " . In addition , later in this period , the use of features derived from the Aesthetic Movement was introduced . It is not known what part Edward Paley played in these developments , but Brandwood et al. argue that they are " undoubtedly attributable to the influence of Austin " . This is not to down @-@ play the work done by Paley during this period . Brandwood et al. point out that of the two , Paley had the more outgoing personality , and because of this , and because of his senior position , the writers suggest that he , rather than Austin , would " tend to ' front ' many of the dealings of the firm " . They also suggest that Paley would be more at ease in dealing with patrons , such as the Duke of Devonshire , in discussing the rebuilding of Holker Hall after the fire of 1871 , and that he would have played a greater part in training the pupils in the practice . 
 Paley did have some individual responsibilities within the practice . He took over from Sharpe as <unk> of the South Lonsdale Hundred in 1860 , and in 1868 he was appointed as inspector of Lancaster Gaol and the Judge 's Lodgings . He served on the committee of the Royal Albert Asylum for many years , taking much interest in its management . He was a director of the Lancaster Waggon Company , for whom he designed their factory , the Lancaster Carriage and Wagon Works ( 1864 – 65 ) . In his role as bridgemaster he was responsible for the new road bridge over the River Lune at Caton ( 1882 – 83 ) following its collapse in 1881 . Paley became a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1871 , served on its council for two periods , and at the time of his death was one of its examiners . 
 = = Architectural styles = = 
 During the first half of the 19th century ecclesiastical architecture was moving away from the Neoclassical style towards Gothic . Initially the churches in Gothic Revival style incorporated Gothic @-@ like features , such as lancet windows , and towers with pinnacles and crockets . This was known as a pre @-@ archaeological style and was used in the first phase of the Commissioners ' Churches . A. W. N. Pugin argued that these features should correctly and accurately reflect medieval Gothic architecture rather than mimic it , and Sharpe became an expert in this movement . Paley learned much of this from Sharpe and as a consequence incorporated " correct " Gothic features in his own work . At the same time the Cambridge Camden Society , influenced by the Oxford Movement , were advocating a more sacramental form of liturgy , which required a larger chancel than that normally provided in the Commissioners ' Churches . Paley was also influenced in this by his brother , Frederick , who was a member of the Camden Society and was himself an expert on medieval architecture . Most of Paley 's churches followed precedents from the 13th and 14th centuries , and were in Early English , or in Decorated style , mainly the latter . Their common plan consisted of open roofs , benches for the congregation , stalls in the chancel , a pulpit to the side of the entrance to the chancel , steps leading up to the chancel , and a font at the west end . Paley is not seen as an innovator in church design , and he did not use devices such as polychromy , which was being introduced elsewhere . He did however introduce Perpendicular features into some of his designs , for example , St Patrick , Preston Patrick , St Peter , Rylstone ( both 1852 – 53 ) , and in the rebuilding of St Paul 's Church , Brookhouse ( 1865 – 67 ) . Paley 's early new churches had plastered interiors , but in 1860 he introduced an interior of bare brick in St Peter , Quernmore . This feature was repeated in a similar manner in later churches including St Mark , Preston , and St James , Barrow . 
 In his secular commissions , Paley employed a greater variety of architectural styles , including features of Tudor Revival architecture . The earliest major building in which he used this style was Wennington Hall ( 1855 – 56 ) . As a contrast was the country house , The Ridding ( 1857 – 60 ) , which is in Scottish Baronial style , the only building in which he used this style . Another building in Tudor style is the country house <unk> Riggs ( 1865 ) . His most important building , the Royal Albert Asylum ( 1868 – 73 ) , is Gothic in style , but , in the opinion of Hartwell and Pevsner , it incorporates French features , in particular the steep hipped roof of the central tower . After Hubert Austin joined the practice , it becomes difficult to determine the specific input of any individual partner . New architectural features were introduced , and Brandwood et al. consider that Paley " tends to be overshadowed " by Austin , but the practice continued to design fine buildings throughout the time that Paley was a principal .

 Edward Paley married Frances Sharpe , Edmund Sharpe 's sister , in June 1851 . They had five children , three daughters followed by two sons , the youngest of whom , Henry Anderson ( known as Harry ) , joined his father as a partner in the practice . The family lived initially at 35 Castle Park , near Lancaster Castle , before moving to a house to the south of Lancaster called The Greaves , which Paley designed himself . He also converted a former workhouse into a country house for himself , called <unk> , at Brookhouse , near Caton to the north @-@ east of Lancaster . Paley was a keen Anglican churchman , initially attending Lancaster Priory , and later St Paul 's Church , Brookhouse , a church that he largely rebuilt in 1866 – 67 . Paley took little interest in local politics , although he did serve as a Conservative councillor for three years from 1858 ; he declined to be renominated at the end of his term . He was involved in other ways in social concerns , serving on the committees of local schools and the Mechanics ' Institute . He also played a major part in establishing the Royal Albert Asylum , designing the building and serving on its committee . Paley shared sporting and musical interests with Sharpe , being a member of the John O <unk> Bowmen , and helping Sharpe to set up the Lancaster Rowing Club . Paley and his wife were members of the Lancaster Choral Society , Paley was involved with the Athenaeum Company and the Lancaster Philosophical Society , and in 1873 founded the County Club , a gentleman 's club in Lancaster . He was also interested in archaeology , and was a founder member of the Royal Archaeological Society , and a member of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society . He died on 23 January 1895 , having suffered from typhoid fever for 20 days . Although he had not played a prominent role in the political life of Lancaster he had been active in the life of the town , and was given a civic funeral ; he was buried in Lancaster Cemetery . His estate amounted to £ 71 @,@ 939 ( equivalent to £ 7 @,@ 490 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) .

 Hartwell and Pevsner consider that the architectural partnership of Austin and Paley " did more outstanding work than any other in the county " , and that this work was " outstanding in the national as well as the regional context " . Although during the time of the Paley and Austin partnership , Austin has been given more credit for the originality of the designs , Paley had a good reputation as a church architect in his own right . After his death the Architect & Contract Reporter carried an article highlighting this aspect of his work . In respect of St Peter , Lancaster ( later Lancaster Cathedral ) , Brandwood et al. consider it to be " Paley 's masterpiece as an independent church architect " . In 1901 the German architect and critic Hermann Muthesius mentioned it in his survey of English churches " with some enthusiasm " . Nikolaus Pevsner writing in 1969 described it as " a fine , aspiring building " , and Pevsner 's successors in the Buildings of England series describe it as his " chef d 'oeuvre " . Later Paley 's work tended to be overshadowed by Austin , although it is usually impossible to determine which partner was responsible for which design . 
 Paley has been described as being " an attractive individual , popular and a leading figure in the life of Lancaster " . His obituary in the Lancaster Guardian described him as " one of nature 's gentlemen , always cheerful and kindly ... esteemed and respected by all " . 
 = Han dynasty = 
 The Han dynasty ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : Hàn cháo ) was the second imperial dynasty of China ( 206 BC – 220 AD ) , preceded by the Qin dynasty ( 221 – 206 BC ) and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period ( 220 – 280 AD ) . Spanning over four centuries , the Han period is considered a golden age in Chinese history . To this day , China 's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the " Han people " and the Chinese script is referred to as " Han characters " . It was founded by the rebel leader Liu Bang , known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu of Han , and briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty ( 9 – 23 AD ) of the former regent Wang Mang . This interregnum separates the Han dynasty into two periods : the Western Han or Former Han ( 206 BC – 9 AD ) and the Eastern Han or Later Han ( 25 – 220 AD ) . 
 The emperor was at the pinnacle of Han society . He presided over the Han government but shared power with both the nobility and appointed ministers who came largely from the scholarly gentry class . The Han Empire was divided into areas directly controlled by the central government using an innovation inherited from the Qin known as commanderies , and a number of semi @-@ autonomous kingdoms . These kingdoms gradually lost all vestiges of their independence , particularly following the Rebellion of the Seven States . From the reign of Emperor Wu onward , the Chinese court officially sponsored Confucianism in education and court politics , synthesized with the cosmology of later scholars such as Dong Zhongshu . This policy endured until the fall of the Qing dynasty in AD 1911 . 
 The Han dynasty was an age of economic prosperity and saw a significant growth of the money economy first established during the Zhou dynasty ( c . 1050 – 256 BC ) . The coinage issued by the central government mint in 119 BC remained the standard coinage of China until the Tang dynasty ( 618 – 907 AD ) . The period saw a number of limited institutional innovations . To pay for its military campaigns and the settlement of newly conquered frontier territories , the government nationalized the private salt and iron industries in 117 BC , but these government monopolies were repealed during the Eastern Han period . Science and technology during the Han period saw significant advances , including papermaking , the nautical steering rudder , the use of negative numbers in mathematics , the raised @-@ relief map , the hydraulic @-@ powered armillary sphere for astronomy , and a seismometer employing an inverted pendulum . 
 The Xiongnu , a nomadic steppe confederation , defeated the Han in 200 BC and forced the Han to submit as a de facto inferior partner , but continued their raids on the Han borders . Emperor Wu of Han ( r . 141 – 87 BC ) launched several military campaigns against them . The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries . These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia , divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations , and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road , which reached as far as the Mediterranean world . The territories north of Han 's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation . Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south , annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC , and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang <unk> were established in 108 BC . 
 After 92 AD , the palace eunuchs increasingly involved themselves in court politics , engaging in violent power struggles between the various consort clans of the empresses and empresses dowager , causing the Han 's ultimate downfall . Imperial authority was also seriously challenged by large Daoist religious societies which instigated the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion . Following the death of Emperor Ling ( r . 168 – 189 AD ) , the palace eunuchs suffered wholesale massacre by military officers , allowing members of the aristocracy and military governors to become warlords and divide the empire . When Cao Pi , King of Wei , usurped the throne from Emperor Xian , the Han dynasty ceased to exist . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 According to the Records of the Grand Historian , after the collapse of the Qin dynasty the hegemon Xiang Yu appointed Liu Bang as prince of the small fief of Hanzhong , named after its location on the Han River ( in modern southwest Shaanxi ) . Following Liu Bang 's victory in the Chu – Han Contention , the resulting Han dynasty was named after the Hanzhong fief .

 = = = Western Han = = = 
 China 's first imperial dynasty was the Qin dynasty ( 221 – 206 BC ) . The Qin unified the Chinese Warring States by conquest , but their empire became unstable after the death of the first emperor Qin Shi Huangdi . Within four years , the dynasty 's authority had collapsed in the face of rebellion . Two former rebel leaders , Xiang Yu ( d . 202 BC ) of Chu and Liu Bang ( d . 195 BC ) of Han , engaged in a war to decide who would become hegemon of China , which had fissured into 18 kingdoms , each claiming allegiance to either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang . Although Xiang Yu proved to be a capable commander , Liu Bang defeated him at Battle of <unk> ( 202 BC ) , in modern @-@ day Anhui . Liu Bang assumed the title " emperor " ( huangdi ) at the urging of his followers and is known posthumously as Emperor Gaozu ( r . 202 – 195 BC ) . Chang 'an was chosen as the new capital of the reunified empire under Han . 
 At the beginning of the Western Han dynasty , thirteen centrally controlled commanderies — including the capital region — existed in the western third of the empire , while the eastern two @-@ thirds were divided into ten semi @-@ autonomous kingdoms . To placate his prominent commanders from the war with Chu , Emperor Gaozu enfeoffed some of them as kings . By 157 BC , the Han court had replaced all of these kings with royal Liu family members , since the loyalty of non @-@ relatives to the throne was questioned . After several insurrections by Han kings — the largest being the Rebellion of the Seven States in 154 BC — the imperial court enacted a series of reforms beginning in 145 BC limiting the size and power of these kingdoms and dividing their former territories into new centrally controlled commanderies . Kings were no longer able to appoint their own staff ; this duty was assumed by the imperial court . Kings became nominal heads of their fiefs and collected a portion of tax revenues as their personal incomes . The kingdoms were never entirely abolished and existed throughout the remainder of Western and Eastern Han . 
 To the north of China proper , the nomadic Xiongnu chieftain Modu Chanyu ( r . 209 – 174 BC ) conquered various tribes inhabiting the eastern portion of the Eurasian Steppe . By the end of his reign , he controlled Manchuria , Mongolia , and the Tarim Basin , subjugating over twenty states east of Samarkand . Emperor Gaozu was troubled about the abundant Han @-@ manufactured iron weapons traded to the Xiongnu along the northern borders , and he established a trade embargo against the group . Although the embargo was in place , the Xiongnu found traders willing to supply their needs . Chinese forces also mounted surprise attacks against Xiongnu who traded at the border markets . In retaliation , the Xiongnu invaded what is now Shanxi province , where they defeated the Han forces at <unk> in 200 BC . After negotiations , the heqin agreement in 198 BC nominally held the leaders of the Xiongnu and the Han as equal partners in a royal marriage alliance , but the Han were forced to send large amounts of tribute items such as silk clothes , food , and wine to the Xiongnu . 
 Despite the tribute and a negotiation between Laoshang Chanyu ( r . 174 – 160 BC ) and Emperor Wen ( r . 180 – 157 BC ) to reopen border markets , many of the Chanyu 's Xiongnu subordinates chose not to obey the treaty and periodically raided Han territories south of the Great Wall for additional goods . In a court conference assembled by Emperor Wu ( r . 141 – 87 BC ) in 135 BC , the majority consensus of the ministers was to retain the heqin agreement . Emperor Wu accepted this , despite continuing Xiongnu raids . However , a court conference the following year convinced the majority that a limited engagement at Mayi involving the assassination of the Chanyu would throw the Xiongnu realm into chaos and benefit the Han . When this plot failed in 133 BC , Emperor Wu launched a series of massive military invasions into Xiongnu territory . Chinese armies captured one stronghold after another and established agricultural colonies to strengthen their hold . The assault culminated in 119 BC at the Battle of <unk> , where the Han commanders Huo Qubing ( d . 117 BC ) and Wei Qing ( d . 106 BC ) forced the Xiongnu court to flee north of the Gobi Desert . 
 After Wu 's reign , Han forces continued to prevail against the Xiongnu . The Xiongnu leader Huhanye Chanyu ( 呼韓邪 ) ( r . 58 – 31 BC ) finally submitted to Han as a tributary vassal in 51 BC . His rival claimant to the throne , Zhizhi Chanyu ( r . 56 – 36 BC ) , was killed by Chen Tang and Gan <unk> ( <unk> / <unk> ) at the Battle of Zhizhi , in modern <unk> , Kazakhstan . 
 In 121 BC , Han forces expelled the Xiongnu from a vast territory spanning the Hexi Corridor to Lop Nur . They repelled a joint Xiongnu @-@ Qiang invasion of this northwestern territory in 111 BC . In that year , the Han court established four new frontier commanderies in this region : Jiuquan , <unk> , Dunhuang , and Wuwei . The majority of people on the frontier were soldiers . On occasion , the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new frontier settlements , along with government @-@ owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor . The court also encouraged commoners , such as farmers , merchants , landowners , and hired laborers , to voluntarily migrate to the frontier . 
 Even before Han 's expansion into Central Asia , diplomat Zhang Qian 's travels from 139 to 125 BC had established Chinese contacts with many surrounding civilizations . Zhang encountered Dayuan ( Fergana ) , Kangju ( Sogdiana ) , and Daxia ( Bactria , formerly the Greco @-@ Bactrian Kingdom ) ; he also gathered information on <unk> ( Indus River valley of North India ) and Anxi ( the Parthian Empire ) . All of these countries eventually received Han embassies . These connections marked the beginning of the Silk Road trade network that extended to the Roman Empire , bringing Han items like silk to Rome and Roman goods such as glasswares to China . 
 From roughly 115 to 60 BC , Han forces fought the Xiongnu over control of the oasis city @-@ states in the Tarim Basin . Han was eventually victorious and established the Protectorate of the Western Regions in 60 BC , which dealt with the region 's defense and foreign affairs . The Han also expanded southward . The naval conquest of Nanyue in 111 BC expanded the Han realm into what are now modern Guangdong , Guangxi , and northern Vietnam . Yunnan was brought into the Han realm with the conquest of the Dian Kingdom in 109 BC , followed by parts of the Korean Peninsula with the colonial establishments of Xuantu Commandery and Lelang Commandery in 108 BC . In China 's first known nationwide census taken in 2 AD , the population was registered as having 57 @,@ 671 @,@ 400 individuals in 12 @,@ 366 @,@ 470 households . 
 To pay for his military campaigns and colonial expansion , Emperor Wu nationalized several private industries . He created central government monopolies administered largely by former merchants . These monopolies included salt , iron , and liquor production , as well as bronze @-@ coin currency . The liquor monopoly lasted only from 98 to 81 BC , and the salt and iron monopolies were eventually abolished in early Eastern Han . The issuing of coinage remained a central government monopoly throughout the rest of the Han dynasty . The government monopolies were eventually repealed when a political faction known as the Reformists gained greater influence in the court . The Reformists opposed the Modernist faction that had dominated court politics in Emperor Wu 's reign and during the subsequent regency of Huo Guang ( d . 68 BC ) . The Modernists argued for an aggressive and expansionary foreign policy supported by revenues from heavy government intervention in the private economy . The Reformists , however , overturned these policies , favoring a cautious , non @-@ expansionary approach to foreign policy , frugal budget reform , and lower tax @-@ rates imposed on private entrepreneurs . 
 = = = Wang Mang 's reign and civil war = = = 
 Wang Zhengjun ( 71 BC – 13 AD ) was first empress , then empress dowager , and finally grand empress dowager during the reigns of the Emperors Yuan ( r . 49 – 33 BC ) , Cheng ( r . 33 – 7 BC ) , and Ai ( r . 7 – 1 BC ) , respectively . During this time , a succession of her male relatives held the title of regent . Following the death of Ai , Wang Zhengjun 's nephew Wang Mang ( 45 BC – 23 AD ) was appointed regent as Marshall of State on 16 August under Emperor Ping ( r . 1 BC – 6 AD ) . 
 When Ping died on 3 February 6 AD , <unk> Ying ( d . 25 AD ) was chosen as the heir and Wang Mang was appointed to serve as acting emperor for the child . Wang promised to relinquish his control to Liu Ying once he came of age . Despite this promise , and against protest and revolts from the nobility , Wang Mang claimed on 10 January that the divine Mandate of Heaven called for the end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of his own : the Xin dynasty ( 9 – 23 AD ) . 
 Wang Mang initiated a series of major reforms that were ultimately unsuccessful . These reforms included outlawing slavery , nationalizing land to equally distribute between households , and introducing new currencies , a change which debased the value of coinage . Although these reforms provoked considerable opposition , Wang 's regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of c . 3 AD and 11 AD . Gradual silt buildup in the Yellow River had raised its water level and overwhelmed the flood control works . The Yellow River split into two new branches : one emptying to the north and the other to the south of the Shandong Peninsula , though Han engineers managed to dam the southern branch by 70 AD . 
 The flood dislodged thousands of peasant farmers , many of whom joined roving bandit and rebel groups such as the Red Eyebrows to survive . Wang Mang 's armies were incapable of quelling these enlarged rebel groups . Eventually , an insurgent mob forced their way into the Weiyang Palace and killed Wang Mang . 
 The Gengshi Emperor ( r . 23 – 25 AD ) , a descendant of Emperor Jing ( r . 157 – 141 BC ) , attempted to restore the Han dynasty and occupied Chang 'an as his capital . However , he was overwhelmed by the Red Eyebrow rebels who deposed , assassinated , and replaced him with the puppet monarch Liu <unk> . Emperor Gengshi 's brother Liu Xiu , known posthumously as Emperor Guangwu ( r . 25 – 57 AD ) , after distinguishing himself at the Battle of <unk> in 23 AD , was urged to succeed Gengshi as emperor . 
 Under Guangwu 's rule the Han Empire was restored . Guangwu made Luoyang his capital in 25 AD , and by 27 AD his officers Deng Yu and Feng Yi had forced the Red Eyebrows to surrender and executed their leaders for treason . From 26 until 36 AD , Emperor Guangwu had to wage war against other regional warlords who claimed the title of emperor ; when these warlords were defeated , China reunified under the Han . 
 The period between the foundation of the Han dynasty and Wang Mang 's reign is known as the Western Han dynasty ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : Xī Hàn ) or Former Han dynasty ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> ) ( 206 BC – 9 AD ) . During this period the capital was at Chang 'an ( modern Xi 'an ) . From the reign of Guangwu the capital was moved eastward to Luoyang . The era from his reign until the fall of Han is known as the Eastern Han dynasty ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : Dōng Hàn ) or the Later Han dynasty ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> Hàn ) ( 25 – 220 AD ) . 
 = = = Eastern Han = = = 
 The Eastern Han , also known as the Later Han , formally began on 5 August 25 , when Liu Xiu became Emperor Guangwu of Han . During the widespread rebellion against Wang Mang , the state of Goguryeo was free to raid Han 's Korean commanderies ; Han did not reaffirm its control over the region until AD 30 . The <unk> Sisters of Vietnam rebelled against Han in AD 40 . Their rebellion was crushed by Han general Ma Yuan ( d . AD 49 ) in a campaign from AD 42 – 43 . Wang Mang renewed hostilities against the Xiongnu , who were estranged from Han until their leader Bi ( <unk> ) , a rival claimant to the throne against his cousin Punu ( <unk> ) , submitted to Han as a tributary vassal in AD 50 . This created two rival Xiongnu states : the Southern Xiongnu led by Bi , an ally of Han , and the Northern Xiongnu led by Punu , an enemy of Han . 
 During the turbulent reign of Wang Mang , Han lost control over the Tarim Basin , which was conquered by the Northern Xiongnu in AD 63 and used as a base to invade Han 's Hexi Corridor in Gansu . Dou Gu ( d . 88 AD ) defeated the Northern Xiongnu at the Battle of <unk> in AD 73 , evicting them from Turpan and chasing them as far as Lake <unk> before establishing a garrison at Hami . After the new Protector General of the Western Regions Chen Mu ( d . AD 75 ) was killed by allies of the Xiongnu in Karasahr and Kucha , the garrison at Hami was withdrawn . At the Battle of <unk> Bayan in AD 89 , Dou Xian ( d . AD 92 ) defeated the Northern Xiongnu chanyu who then retreated into the Altai Mountains . After the Northern Xiongnu fled into the Ili River valley in AD 91 , the nomadic Xianbei occupied the area from the borders of the Buyeo Kingdom in Manchuria to the Ili River of the Wusun people . The Xianbei reached their apogee under Tanshihuai ( <unk> ) ( d . AD 180 ) , who consistently defeated Chinese armies . However , Tanshihuai 's confederation disintegrated after his death . 
 Ban Chao ( d . AD 102 ) enlisted the aid of the Kushan Empire , occupying the area of modern India , Pakistan , Afghanistan , and Tajikistan , to subdue Kashgar and its ally Sogdiana . When a request by Kushan ruler Vima <unk> ( r. c . 90 – c . 100 AD ) for a marriage alliance with the Han was rejected in AD 90 , he sent his forces to Wakhan ( Afghanistan ) to attack Ban Chao . The conflict ended with the <unk> withdrawing because of lack of supplies . In AD 91 , the office of Protector General of the Western Regions was reinstated when it was bestowed on Ban Chao . 
 In addition to tributary relations with the <unk> , the Han Empire received gifts from the Parthian Empire , from a king in modern Burma , from a ruler in Japan , and initiated an unsuccessful mission to Daqin ( Rome ) in AD 97 with Gan Ying as emissary . A Roman embassy of Emperor Marcus Aurelius ( r . 161 – 180 AD ) is recorded in the Hou <unk> to have reached the court of Emperor Huan of Han ( r . AD 146 – 168 ) in AD 166 , yet Rafe de Crespigny asserts that this was most likely a group of Roman merchants . Other travelers to Eastern @-@ Han China included Buddhist monks who translated works into Chinese , such as An Shigao of Parthia , and Lokaksema from Kushan @-@ era Gandhara , India . 
 Emperor Zhang 's ( r . 75 – 88 AD ) reign came to be viewed by later Eastern Han scholars as the high point of the dynastic house . Subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by eunuch intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power struggles of the imperial consort clans . With the aid of the eunuch Zheng Zhong ( d . 107 AD ) , Emperor He ( r . 88 – 105 AD ) had Empress Dowager Dou ( d . 97 AD ) put under house arrest and her clan stripped of power . This was in revenge for Dou 's purging of the clan of his natural mother — Consort Liang — and then concealing her identity from him . After Emperor He 's death , his wife Empress Deng Sui ( d . 121 AD ) managed state affairs as the regent empress dowager during a turbulent financial crisis and widespread Qiang rebellion that lasted from 107 to 118 AD . 
 When Empress Dowager Deng died , Emperor An ( r . 106 – 125 AD ) was convinced by the accusations of the eunuchs Li Run ( <unk> ) and Jiang Jing ( <unk> ) that Deng and her family had planned to depose him . An dismissed Deng 's clan members from office , exiled them and forced many to commit suicide . After An 's death , his wife , Empress Dowager Yan ( d . 126 AD ) placed the child Marquess of <unk> on the throne in an attempt to retain power within her family . However , palace eunuch Sun Cheng ( d . 132 AD ) masterminded a successful overthrow of her regime to enthrone Emperor Shun of Han ( r . 125 – 144 AD ) . Yan was placed under house arrest , her relatives were either killed or exiled , and her eunuch allies were slaughtered . The regent Liang Ji ( d . 159 AD ) , brother of Empress Liang Na ( d . 150 AD ) , had the brother @-@ in @-@ law of Consort Deng Mengnü ( later empress ) ( d . 165 AD ) killed after Deng Mengnü resisted Liang Ji 's attempts to control her . Afterward , Emperor Huan employed eunuchs to depose Liang Ji , who was then forced to commit suicide . 
 Students from the Imperial University organized a widespread student protest against the eunuchs of Emperor Huan 's court . Huan further alienated the bureaucracy when he initiated grandiose construction projects and hosted thousands of concubines in his harem at a time of economic crisis . Palace eunuchs imprisoned the official Li Ying ( 李膺 ) and his associates from the Imperial University on a dubious charge of treason . In 167 AD , the Grand Commandant Dou Wu ( d . 168 AD ) convinced his son @-@ in @-@ law , Emperor Huan , to release them . However the emperor permanently barred Li Ying and his associates from serving in office , marking the beginning of the Partisan Prohibitions . 
 Following Huan 's death , Dou Wu and the Grand Tutor Chen Fan ( <unk> ) ( d . 168 AD ) attempted a coup d 'état against the eunuchs Hou Lan ( d . 172 AD ) , Cao Jie ( d . 181 AD ) , and Wang Fu ( <unk> ) . When the plot was uncovered , the eunuchs arrested Empress Dowager Dou ( d . 172 AD ) and Chen Fan . General Zhang Huan ( <unk> ) favored the eunuchs . He and his troops confronted Dou Wu and his retainers at the palace gate where each side shouted accusations of treason against the other . When the retainers gradually deserted Dou Wu , he was forced to commit suicide . 
 Under Emperor Ling ( r . 168 – 189 AD ) the eunuchs had the partisan prohibitions renewed and expanded , while themselves auctioning off top government offices . Many affairs of state were entrusted to the eunuchs Zhao Zhong ( d . 189 AD ) and Zhang Rang ( d . 189 AD ) while Emperor Ling spent much of his time roleplaying with concubines and participating in military parades . 
 = = = End of the Han dynasty = = = 
 The Partisan Prohibitions were repealed during the Yellow Turban Rebellion and Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion in 184 AD , largely because the court did not want to continue to alienate a significant portion of the gentry class who might otherwise join the rebellions . The Yellow Turbans and Five @-@ Pecks @-@ of @-@ Rice adherents belonged to two different hierarchical Daoist religious societies led by faith healers Zhang Jue ( d . 184 AD ) and Zhang Lu ( d . 216 AD ) , respectively . Zhang Lu 's rebellion , in modern northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi , was not quelled until 215 AD . Zhang Jue 's massive rebellion across eight provinces was annihilated by Han forces within a year , however the following decades saw much smaller recurrent uprisings . Although the Yellow Turbans were defeated , many generals appointed during the crisis never disbanded their assembled militia forces and used these troops to amass power outside of the collapsing imperial authority . 
 General @-@ in @-@ Chief He Jin ( d . 189 AD ) , half @-@ brother to Empress He ( d . 189 AD ) , plotted with Yuan Shao ( d . 202 AD ) to overthrow the eunuchs by having several generals march to the outskirts of the capital . There , in a written petition to Empress He , they demanded the eunuchs ' execution . After a period of hesitation , Empress He consented . When the eunuchs discovered this , however , they had her brother He Miao ( <unk> ) rescind the order . The eunuchs assassinated He Jin on September 22 , 189 AD . Yuan Shao then besieged Luoyang 's Northern Palace while his brother Yuan Shu ( d . 199 AD ) besieged the Southern Palace . On September 25 both palaces were breached and approximately two thousand eunuchs were killed . Zhang Rang had previously fled with Emperor Shao ( r . 189 AD ) and his brother Liu Xie — the future Emperor Xian of Han ( r . 189 – 220 AD ) . While being pursued by the Yuan brothers , Zhang committed suicide by jumping into the Yellow River . 
 General Dong Zhuo ( d . 192 AD ) found the young emperor and his brother wandering in the countryside . He escorted them safely back to the capital and was made Minister of Works , taking control of Luoyang and forcing Yuan Shao to flee . After Dong Zhuo demoted Emperor Shao and promoted his brother Liu Xie as Emperor Xian , Yuan Shao led a coalition of former officials and officers against Dong , who burned Luoyang to the ground and resettled the court at Chang 'an in May 191 AD . Dong Zhuo later poisoned Emperor Shao . 
 Dong was killed by his adopted son Lü Bu ( d . 198 AD ) in a plot hatched by Wang Yun ( d . 192 AD ) . Emperor Xian fled from Chang 'an in 195 AD to the ruins of Luoyang . Xian was persuaded by Cao Cao ( 155 – 220 AD ) , then Governor of Yan Province in modern western Shandong and eastern Henan , to move the capital to Xuchang in 196 AD . 
 Yuan Shao challenged Cao Cao for control over the emperor . Yuan 's power was greatly diminished after Cao defeated him at the Battle of Guandu in 200 AD . After Yuan died , Cao killed Yuan Shao 's son Yuan Tan ( 173 – 205 AD ) , who had fought with his brothers over the family inheritance . His brothers Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi were killed in 207 AD by Gongsun Kang ( d . 221 AD ) , who sent their heads to Cao Cao . 
 After Cao 's defeat at the naval Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 AD , China was divided into three spheres of influence , with Cao Cao dominating the north , Sun Quan ( 182 – 252 AD ) dominating the south , and Liu Bei ( 161 – 223 AD ) dominating the west . Cao Cao died in March 220 AD . By December his son Cao Pi ( 187 – 226 AD ) had Emperor Xian relinquish the throne to him and is known posthumously as Emperor Wen of Wei . This formally ended the Han dynasty and initiated an age of conflict between three states : Cao Wei , Eastern Wu , and Shu Han . 
 = = Society and culture = = 
 = = = Social class = = = 
 In the hierarchical social order , the emperor was at the apex of Han society and government . However the emperor was often a minor , ruled over by a regent such as the empress dowager or one of her male relatives . Ranked immediately below the emperor were the kings who were of the same Liu family clan . The rest of society , including nobles lower than kings and all commoners excluding slaves belonged to one of twenty ranks ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . 
 Each successive rank gave its holder greater pensions and legal privileges . The highest rank , of full marquess , came with a state pension and a territorial fiefdom . Holders of the rank immediately below , that of ordinary marquess , received a pension , but had no territorial rule . Officials who served in government belonged to the wider commoner social class and were ranked just below nobles in social prestige . The highest government officials could be enfeoffed as marquesses . By the Eastern Han period , local elites of unattached scholars , teachers , students , and government officials began to identify themselves as members of a larger , nationwide gentry class with shared values and a commitment to mainstream scholarship . When the government became noticeably corrupt in mid @-@ to @-@ late Eastern Han , many gentrymen even considered the cultivation of morally grounded personal relationships more important than serving in public office . 
 The farmer , or specifically the small landowner @-@ cultivator , was ranked just below scholars and officials in the social hierarchy . Other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status , such as tenants , wage laborers , and in rare cases slaves . Artisans and craftsmen had a legal and socioeconomic status between that of owner @-@ cultivator farmers and common merchants . State @-@ registered merchants , who were forced by law to wear white @-@ colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes , were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status . These were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces ; merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and more powerful than the vast majority of government officials . Wealthy landowners , such as nobles and officials , often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties , sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle . Unlike slaves , retainers could come and go from their master 's home as they pleased . Medical physicians , pig breeders , and butchers had a fairly high social status , while occultist diviners , runners , and messengers had low status . 
 = = = Marriage , gender , and kinship = = = 
 The Han @-@ era family was patrilineal and typically had four to five nuclear family members living in one household . Multiple generations of extended family members did not occupy the same house , unlike families of later dynasties . According to Confucian family norms , various family members were treated with different levels of respect and intimacy . For example , there were different accepted time frames for mourning the death of a father versus a paternal uncle . Arranged marriages were normal , with the father 's input on his offspring 's spouse being considered more important than the mother 's . Monogamous marriages were also normal , although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers . Under certain conditions dictated by custom , not law , both men and women were able to divorce their spouses and remarry . 
 Apart from the passing of noble titles or ranks , inheritance practices did not involve primogeniture ; each son received an equal share of the family property . Unlike the practice in later dynasties , the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune . Daughters received a portion of the family fortune through their marriage dowries , though this was usually much less than the shares of sons . A different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a will , but it is unclear how common this was . 
 Women were expected to obey the will of their father , then their husband , and then their adult son in old age . However , it is known from contemporary sources that there were many deviations to this rule , especially in regard to mothers over their sons , and empresses who ordered around and openly humiliated their fathers and brothers . Women were exempt from the annual corvée labor duties , but often engaged in a range of income @-@ earning occupations aside from their domestic chores of cooking and cleaning . 
 The most common occupation for women was weaving clothes for the family , sale at market or for large textile enterprises that employed hundreds of women . Other women helped on their brothers ' farms or became singers , dancers , sorceresses , respected medical physicians , and successful merchants who could afford their own silk clothes . Some women formed spinning collectives , aggregating the resources of several different families . 
 = = = Education , literature , and philosophy = = = 
 The early Western Han court simultaneously accepted the philosophical teachings of Legalism , Huang @-@ Lao Daoism , and Confucianism in making state decisions and shaping government policy . However , the Han court under Emperor Wu gave Confucianism exclusive patronage . He abolished all academic chairs or <unk> ( <unk> 博士 ) not dealing with the Confucian Five Classics in 136 BC and encouraged nominees for office to receive a Confucian @-@ based education at the Imperial University that he established in 124 BC . Unlike the original ideology espoused by Confucius , or Kongzi ( 551 – 479 BC ) , Han Confucianism in Emperor Wu 's reign was the creation of Dong Zhongshu ( 179 – 104 BC ) . Dong was a scholar and minor official who aggregated the ethical Confucian ideas of ritual , filial piety , and harmonious relationships with five phases and yin @-@ yang cosmologies . Much to the interest of the ruler , Dong 's synthesis justified the imperial system of government within the natural order of the universe . The Imperial University grew in importance as the student body grew to over 30 @,@ 000 by the 2nd century AD . A Confucian @-@ based education was also made available at commandery @-@ level schools and private schools opened in small towns , where teachers earned respectable incomes from tuition payments . 
 Some important texts were created and studied by scholars . Philosophical works written by Yang Xiong ( 53 BC – 18 AD ) , Huan Tan ( 43 BC – 28 AD ) , Wang Chong ( 27 – 100 AD ) , and Wang Fu ( 78 – 163 AD ) questioned whether human nature was innately good or evil and posed challenges to Dong 's universal order . The Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Tan ( d . 110 BC ) and his son Sima Qian ( 145 – 86 BC ) established the standard model for all of imperial China 's Standard Histories , such as the Book of Han written by Ban Biao ( 3 – 54 AD ) , his son Ban Gu ( 32 – 92 AD ) , and his daughter Ban Zhao ( 45 – 116 AD ) . There were dictionaries such as the Shuowen Jiezi by Xu Shen ( c . 58 – c . 147 AD ) and the Fangyan by Yang Xiong . Biographies on important figures were written by various gentrymen . Han dynasty poetry was dominated by the fu genre , which achieved its greatest prominence during the reign of Emperor Wu . 
 = = = Law and order = = = 
 Han scholars such as Jia Yi ( 201 – 169 BC ) portrayed the previous Qin dynasty as a brutal regime . However , archaeological evidence from Zhangjiashan and Shuihudi reveal that many of the statutes in the Han law code compiled by Chancellor Xiao He ( d . 193 BC ) were derived from Qin law . 
 Various cases for rape , physical abuse and murder were prosecuted in court . Women , although usually having fewer rights by custom , were allowed to level civil and criminal charges against men . While suspects were jailed , convicted criminals were never imprisoned . Instead , punishments were commonly monetary fines , periods of forced hard labor for convicts , and the penalty of death by beheading . Early Han punishments of torturous mutilation were borrowed from Qin law . A series of reforms abolished mutilation punishments with progressively less @-@ severe beatings by the bastinado . 
 Acting as a judge in lawsuits was one of many duties of the county magistrate and Administrators of commanderies . Complex , high profile or unresolved cases were often deferred to the Minister of Justice in the capital or even the emperor . In each Han county was several districts , each overseen by a chief of police . Order in the cities was maintained by government officers in the marketplaces and constables in the neighborhoods . 
 = = = Food = = = 
 The most common staple crops consumed during Han were wheat , barley , foxtail millet , proso millet , rice , and beans . Commonly eaten fruits and vegetables included chestnuts , pears , plums , peaches , melons , apricots , strawberries , red <unk> , jujubes , calabash , bamboo shoots , mustard plant and taro . Domesticated animals that were also eaten included chickens , Mandarin ducks , geese , cows , sheep , pigs , camels and dogs ( various types were bred specifically for food , while most were used as pets ) . Turtles and fish were taken from streams and lakes . Commonly hunted game , such as owl , pheasant , magpie , sika deer , and Chinese bamboo partridge were consumed . Seasonings included sugar , honey , salt and soy sauce . Beer and wine were regularly consumed . 
 = = = Clothing = = = 
 The types of clothing worn and the materials used during the Han period depended upon social class . Wealthy folk could afford silk robes , skirts , socks , and mittens , coats made of badger or fox fur , duck plumes , and slippers with inlaid leather , pearls , and silk lining . Peasants commonly wore clothes made of hemp , wool , and ferret skins . 
 = = = Religion , cosmology , and metaphysics = = = 
 Families throughout Han China made ritual sacrifices of animals and food to deities , spirits , and ancestors at temples and shrines , in the belief that these items could be utilized by those in the spiritual realm . It was thought that each person had a two @-@ part soul : the spirit @-@ soul ( hun 魂 ) which journeyed to the afterlife paradise of immortals ( xian ) , and the body @-@ soul ( po 魄 ) which remained in its grave or tomb on earth and was only reunited with the spirit @-@ soul through a ritual ceremony . These tombs were commonly adorned with uniquely decorated hollow clay tiles that function also as a doorjamb to the tomb . Otherwise known as tomb tiles , these artifacts feature holes in the top and bottom of the tile allowing it to pivot . Similar tiles have been found in the Chengdu area of Sichuan province in south @-@ central China . 
 In addition to his many other roles , the emperor acted as the highest priest in the land who made sacrifices to Heaven , the main deities known as the Five Powers , and the spirits ( shen 神 ) of mountains and rivers . It was believed that the three realms of Heaven , Earth , and Mankind were linked by natural cycles of yin and yang and the five phases . If the emperor did not behave according to proper ritual , ethics , and morals , he could disrupt the fine balance of these cosmological cycles and cause calamities such as earthquakes , floods , droughts , epidemics , and swarms of locusts . 
 It was believed that immortality could be achieved if one reached the lands of the Queen Mother of the West or Mount <unk> . Han @-@ era Daoists assembled into small groups of hermits who attempted to achieve immortality through breathing exercises , sexual techniques and use of medical elixirs . By the 2nd century AD , Daoists formed large hierarchical religious societies such as the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice . Its followers believed that the sage @-@ philosopher Laozi ( fl . 6th century BC ) was a holy prophet who would offer salvation and good health if his devout followers would confess their sins , ban the worship of unclean gods who accepted meat sacrifices and chant sections of the Daodejing . 
 Buddhism first entered China during the Eastern Han and was first mentioned in 65 AD . Liu Ying ( d . 71 AD ) , a half @-@ brother to Emperor Ming of Han ( r . 57 – 75 AD ) , was one of its earliest Chinese adherents , although Chinese Buddhism at this point was heavily associated with Huang @-@ Lao Daoism . China 's first known Buddhist temple , the White Horse Temple , was constructed outside the wall of the capital , Luoyang , during Emperor Ming 's reign . Important Buddhist canons were translated into Chinese during the 2nd century AD , including the Sutra of Forty @-@ two Chapters , Perfection of Wisdom , Shurangama Sutra , and Pratyutpanna Sutra . 
 = = Government = = 
 = = = Central government = = = 
 In Han government , the emperor was the supreme judge and lawgiver , the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the armed forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations ; those who earned a 600 @-@ bushel salary @-@ rank or higher . Theoretically , there were no limits to his power . However , state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference ( tingyi 廷議 ) — where ministers were convened to reach majority consensus on an issue — pressured the emperor to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions . If the emperor rejected a court conference decision , he risked alienating his high ministers . Nevertheless , emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences . 
 Below the emperor were his cabinet members known as the Three Councillors of State ( San gong <unk> ) . These were the Chancellor or Minister over the Masses ( <unk> <unk> or Da situ <unk> ) , the Imperial Counselor or Excellency of Works ( Yushi <unk> <unk> or Da <unk> <unk> ) , and Grand Commandant or Grand Marshal ( <unk> <unk> or Da sima <unk> ) . 
 The Chancellor , whose title was changed to ' Minister over the Masses ' in 8 BC , was chiefly responsible for drafting the government budget . The Chancellor 's other duties included managing provincial registers for land and population , leading court conferences , acting as judge in lawsuits and recommending nominees for high office . He could appoint officials below the salary @-@ rank of 600 bushels . 
 The Imperial Counselor 's chief duty was to conduct disciplinary procedures for officials . He shared similar duties with the Chancellor , such as receiving annual provincial reports . However , when his title was changed to Minister of Works in 8 BC , his chief duty became oversight of public works projects . 
 The Grand Commandant , whose title was changed to Grand Marshal in 119 BC before reverting to Grand Commandant in 51 AD , was the irregularly posted commander of the military and then regent during the Western Han period . In the Eastern Han era he was chiefly a civil official who shared many of the same censorial powers as the other two Councillors of State . 
 Ranked below the Three Councillors of State were the Nine Ministers ( Jiu qing <unk> ) , who each headed a specialized ministry . The Minister of Ceremonies ( <unk> <unk> ) was the chief official in charge of religious rites , rituals , prayers and the maintenance of ancestral temples and altars . The Minister of the Household ( Guang lu <unk> <unk> ) was in charge of the emperor 's security within the palace grounds , external imperial parks and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot . The Minister of the Guards ( Weiwei <unk> ) was responsible for securing and patrolling the walls , towers , and gates of the imperial palaces . The Minister Coachman ( <unk> <unk> ) was responsible for the maintenance of imperial stables , horses , carriages and coach @-@ houses for the emperor and his palace attendants , as well as the supply of horses for the armed forces . The Minister of Justice ( <unk> <unk> ) was the chief official in charge of upholding , administering , and interpreting the law . The Minister Herald ( Da <unk> <unk> ) was the chief official in charge of receiving honored guests at the imperial court , such as nobles and foreign ambassadors . The Minister of the Imperial Clan ( Zongzheng <unk> ) oversaw the imperial court 's interactions with the empire 's nobility and extended imperial family , such as granting fiefs and titles . The Minister of Finance ( Da <unk> <unk> ) was the treasurer for the official bureaucracy and the armed forces who handled tax revenues and set standards for units of measurement . The Minister Steward ( <unk> <unk> ) served the emperor exclusively , providing him with entertainment and amusements , proper food and clothing , medicine and physical care , valuables and equipment . 
 = = = Local government = = = 
 The Han Empire , excluding kingdoms and marquessates , was divided , in descending order of size , into political units of provinces ( zhou ) , commanderies ( jun ) , and counties ( xian ) . A county was divided into several districts , the latter composed of a group of hamlets , each containing about a hundred families . 
 The heads of provinces , whose official title was changed from Inspector to Governor and vice versa several times during Han , were responsible for inspecting several commandery @-@ level and kingdom @-@ level administrations . On the basis of their reports , the officials in these local administrations would be promoted , demoted , dismissed or prosecuted by the imperial court . 
 A governor could take various actions without permission from the imperial court . The lower @-@ ranked inspector had executive powers only during times of crisis , such as raising militias across the commanderies under his jurisdiction to suppress a rebellion . 
 A commandery consisted of a group of counties , and was headed by an Administrator . He was the top civil and military leader of the commandery and handled defense , lawsuits , seasonal instructions to farmers and recommendations of nominees for office sent annually to the capital in a quota system first established by Emperor Wu . The head of a large county of about 10 @,@ 000 households was called a Prefect , while the heads of smaller counties were called Chiefs , and both could be referred to as Magistrates . A Magistrate maintained law and order in his county , registered the populace for taxation , mobilized commoners for annual corvée duties , repaired schools and supervised public works . 
 = = = Kingdoms and marquessates = = = 
 Kingdoms — roughly the size of commanderies — were ruled exclusively by the emperor 's male relatives as semi @-@ autonomous fiefdoms . Before 157 BC some kingdoms were ruled by non @-@ relatives , granted to them in return for their services to Emperor Gaozu . The administration of each kingdom was very similar to that of the central government . Although the emperor appointed the Chancellor of each kingdom , kings appointed all the remaining civil officials in their fiefs . 
 However , in 145 BC , after several insurrections by the kings , Emperor Jing removed the kings ' rights to appoint officials whose salaries were higher than 400 bushels . The Imperial Counselors and Nine Ministers ( excluding the Minister Coachman ) of every kingdom were abolished , although the Chancellor was still appointed by the central government . 
 With these reforms , kings were reduced to being nominal heads of their fiefs , gaining a personal income from only a portion of the taxes collected in their kingdom . Similarly , the officials in the administrative staff of a full marquess 's fief were appointed by the central government . A marquess 's Chancellor was ranked as the equivalent of a county Prefect . Like a king , the marquess collected a portion of the tax revenues in his fief as personal income . 
 = = = Military = = = 
 At the beginning of the Han dynasty , every male commoner aged twenty @-@ three was liable for conscription into the military . The minimum age for the military draft was reduced to twenty after Emperor Zhao 's ( r . 87 – 74 BC ) reign . Conscripted soldiers underwent one year of training and one year of service as non @-@ professional soldiers . The year of training was served in one of three branches of the armed forces : infantry , cavalry or navy . The year of active service was served either on the frontier , in a king 's court or under the Minister of the Guards in the capital . A small professional ( paid ) standing army was stationed near the capital . 
 During the Eastern Han , conscription could be avoided if one paid a commutable tax . The Eastern Han court favored the recruitment of a volunteer army . The volunteer army comprised the Southern Army ( Nanjun 南軍 ) , while the standing army stationed in and near the capital was the Northern Army ( Beijun 北軍 ) . Led by Colonels ( Xiaowei <unk> ) , the Northern Army consisted of five regiments , each composed of several thousand soldiers . When central authority collapsed after 189 AD , wealthy landowners , members of the aristocracy / nobility , and regional military @-@ governors relied upon their retainers to act as their own personal troops ( <unk> <unk> ) . 
 During times of war , the volunteer army was increased , and a much larger militia was raised across the country to supplement the Northern Army . In these circumstances , a General ( <unk> <unk> ) led a division , which was divided into regiments led by Colonels and sometimes Majors ( Sima <unk> ) . Regiments were divided into companies and led by Captains . Platoons were the smallest units of soldiers . 
 = = Economy = = 
 = = = Variations in currency = = = 
 The Han dynasty inherited the ban liang coin type from the Qin . In the beginning of the Han , Emperor Gaozu closed the government mint in favor of private minting of coins . This decision was reversed in 186 BC by his widow Grand Empress Dowager Lü Zhi ( d . 180 BC ) , who abolished private minting . In 182 BC , Lü Zhi issued a bronze coin that was much lighter in weight than previous coins . This caused widespread inflation that was not reduced until 175 BC when Emperor Wen allowed private minters to manufacture coins that were precisely 2 @.@ 6 g ( 0 @.@ 09 oz ) in weight . 
 In 144 BC Emperor Jing abolished private minting in favor of central @-@ government and commandery @-@ level minting ; he also introduced a new coin . Emperor Wu introduced another in 120 BC , but a year later he abandoned the ban <unk> entirely in favor of the <unk> ( 五銖 ) coin , weighing 3 @.@ 2 g ( 0 @.@ 11 oz ) . The <unk> became China 's standard coin until the Tang dynasty ( 618 – 907 AD ) . Its use was interrupted briefly by several new currencies introduced during Wang Mang 's regime until it was reinstated in 40 AD by Emperor Guangwu . 
 Since commandery @-@ issued coins were often of inferior quality and lighter weight , the central government closed commandery mints and monopolized the issue of coinage in 113 BC . This Central government issuance of coinage was overseen by the Superintendent of Waterways and Parks , this duty being transferred to the Minister of Finance during Eastern Han . 
 = = = Taxation and property = = = 
 Aside from the landowner 's land tax paid in a portion of their crop yield , the poll tax and property taxes were paid in coin cash . The annual poll tax rate for adult men and women was 120 coins and 20 coins for minors . Merchants were required to pay a higher rate of 240 coins . The poll tax stimulated a money economy that necessitated the minting of over 28 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 coins from 118 BC to 5 AD , an average of 220 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 coins a year . 
 The widespread circulation of coin cash allowed successful merchants to invest money in land , empowering the very social class the government attempted to suppress through heavy commercial and property taxes . Emperor Wu even enacted laws which banned registered merchants from owning land , yet powerful merchants were able to avoid registration and own large tracts of land . 
 The small landowner @-@ cultivators formed the majority of the Han tax base ; this revenue was threatened during the latter half of Eastern Han when many peasants fell into debt and were forced to work as farming tenants for wealthy landlords . The Han government enacted reforms in order to keep small landowner @-@ cultivators out of debt and on their own farms . These reforms included reducing taxes , temporary remissions of taxes , granting loans and providing landless peasants temporary lodging and work in agricultural colonies until they could recover from their debts . 
 In 168 BC , the land tax rate was reduced from one @-@ fifteenth of a farming household 's crop yield to one @-@ thirtieth , and later to a one @-@ hundredth of a crop yield for the last decades of the dynasty . The consequent loss of government revenue was compensated for by increasing property taxes . 
 The labor tax took the form of conscripted labor for one month per year , which was imposed upon male commoners aged fifteen to fifty @-@ six . This could be avoided in Eastern Han with a commutable tax , since hired labor became more popular . 
 = = = Private manufacture and government monopolies = = = 
 In the early Western Han , a wealthy salt or iron industrialist , whether a semi @-@ autonomous king or wealthy merchant , could boast funds that rivaled the imperial treasury and amass a peasant workforce of over a thousand . This kept many peasants away from their farms and denied the government a significant portion of its land tax revenue . To eliminate the influence of such private entrepreneurs , Emperor Wu nationalized the salt and iron industries in 117 BC and allowed many of the former industrialists to become officials administering the monopolies . By Eastern Han times , the central government monopolies were repealed in favor of production by commandery and county administrations , as well as private businessmen . 
 Liquor was another profitable private industry nationalized by the central government in 98 BC . However , this was repealed in 81 BC and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0 @.@ 2 L ( 0 @.@ 05 gallons ) was levied for those who traded it privately . By 110 BC Emperor Wu also interfered with the profitable trade in grain when he eliminated speculation by selling government @-@ stored grain at a lower price than demanded by merchants . Apart from Emperor Ming 's creation of a short @-@ lived Office for Price Adjustment and Stabilization , which was abolished in 68 AD , central @-@ government price control regulations were largely absent during the Eastern Han . 
 = = Science , technology , and engineering = = 
 The Han dynasty was a unique period in the development of premodern Chinese science and technology , comparable to the level of scientific and technological growth during the Song dynasty ( 960 – 1279 ) . 
 = = = Writing materials = = = 
 In the 1st millennium BC , typical ancient Chinese writing materials were bronzewares , animal bones , and bamboo slips or wooden boards . By the beginning of the Han dynasty , the chief writing materials were clay tablets , silk cloth , and rolled scrolls made from bamboo strips sewn together with hempen string ; these were passed through drilled holes and secured with clay stamps . 
 The oldest known Chinese piece of hard , hempen wrapping paper dates to the 2nd century BC . The standard papermaking process was invented by Cai Lun ( 50 – 121 AD ) in 105 AD . The oldest known surviving piece of paper with writing on it was found in the ruins of a Han watchtower that had been abandoned in 110 AD , in Inner Mongolia . 
 = = = Metallurgy and agriculture = = = 
 Evidence suggests that blast furnaces , that convert raw iron ore into pig iron , which can be remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron by means of a cold blast and hot blast , were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period ( 722 – 481 BC ) . The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China ; however , the Han @-@ era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization . Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process . 
 The Han @-@ era Chinese used bronze and iron to make a range of weapons , culinary tools , carpenters ' tools and domestic wares . A significant product of these improved iron @-@ smelting techniques was the manufacture of new agricultural tools . The three @-@ legged iron seed drill , invented by the 2nd century BC , enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead of casting seeds out by hand . The heavy moldboard iron plow , also invented during the Han dynasty , required only one man to control it , two oxen to pull it . It had three plowshares , a seed box for the drills , a tool which turned down the soil and could sow roughly 45 @,@ 730 m2 ( 11 @.@ 3 acres ) of land in a single day . 
 To protect crops from wind and drought , the Grain Intendant Zhao Guo ( <unk> ) created the alternating fields system ( <unk> <unk> ) during Emperor Wu 's reign . This system switched the positions of furrows and ridges between growing seasons . Once experiments with this system yielded successful results , the government officially sponsored it and encouraged peasants to use it . Han farmers also used the pit field system ( <unk> <unk> ) for growing crops , which involved heavily fertilized pits that did not require plows or oxen and could be placed on sloping terrain . In southern and small parts of central Han @-@ era China , paddy fields were chiefly used to grow rice , while farmers along the Huai River used transplantation methods of rice production . 
 = = = Structural engineering = = = 
 Timber was the chief building material during the Han dynasty ; it was used to build palace halls , multi @-@ story residential towers and halls and single @-@ story houses . Because wood decays rapidly , the only remaining evidence of Han wooden architecture is a collection of scattered ceramic roof tiles . The oldest surviving wooden halls in China date to the Tang dynasty ( 618 – 907 AD ) . Architectural historian Robert L. Thorp points out the scarcity of Han @-@ era archaeological remains , and claims that often unreliable Han @-@ era literary and artistic sources are used by historians for clues about lost Han architecture . 
 Though Han wooden structures decayed , some Han @-@ dynasty ruins made of brick , stone , and rammed earth remain intact . This includes stone pillar @-@ gates , brick tomb chambers , rammed @-@ earth city walls , rammed @-@ earth and brick beacon towers , rammed @-@ earth sections of the Great Wall , rammed @-@ earth platforms where elevated halls once stood , and two rammed @-@ earth castles in Gansu . The ruins of rammed @-@ earth walls that once surrounded the capitals Chang 'an and Luoyang still stand , along with their drainage systems of brick arches , ditches , and ceramic water pipes . Monumental stone pillar @-@ gates , twenty @-@ nine of which survive from the Han period , formed entrances of walled enclosures at shrine and tomb sites . These pillars feature artistic imitations of wooden and ceramic building components such as roof tiles , eaves , and balustrades . 
 The courtyard house is the most common type of home portrayed in Han artwork . Ceramic architectural models of buildings , like houses and towers , were found in Han tombs , perhaps to provide lodging for the dead in the afterlife . These provide valuable clues about lost wooden architecture . The artistic designs found on ceramic roof tiles of tower models are in some cases exact matches to Han roof tiles found at archaeological sites . 
 Over ten Han @-@ era underground tombs have been found , many of them featuring archways , vaulted chambers , and domed roofs . Underground vaults and domes did not require buttress supports since they were held in place by earthen pits . The use of brick vaults and domes in aboveground Han structures is unknown . 
 From Han literary sources , it is known that wooden @-@ trestle beam bridges , arch bridges , simple suspension bridges , and floating pontoon bridges existed in Han China . However , there are only two known references to arch bridges in Han literature , and only a single Han relief sculpture in Sichuan depicts an arch bridge . 
 Underground mine shafts , some reaching depths over 100 metres ( 330 ft ) , were created for the extraction of metal ores . <unk> drilling and derricks were used to lift brine to iron pans where it was distilled into salt . The distillation furnaces were heated by natural gas funneled to the surface through bamboo pipelines . Dangerous amounts of additional gas were siphoned off via carburetor chambers and exhaust pipes . 
 = = = Mechanical and hydraulic engineering = = = 
 Chinese scholars and officials traditionally considered scientific and engineering pursuits to be the domain of artisans and craftsmen ( <unk> <unk> ) , far beneath the ideal Confucian literary gentleman . Accordingly , evidence of Han @-@ era mechanical engineering comes largely from the choice observational writings of sometimes disinterested Confucian scholars . Professional artisan @-@ engineers ( jiang <unk> ) did not leave behind detailed records of their work . Han scholars , who often had little or no expertise in mechanical engineering , sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described . Nevertheless , some Han literary sources provide crucial information . For example , in 15 BC the philosopher Yang Xiong described the invention of the belt drive for a quilling machine , which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing . The inventions of the artisan @-@ engineer Ding Huan ( <unk> ) are mentioned in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital . Around 180 AD , Ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings . Ding also used gimbals as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the world 's first known zoetrope lamp . 
 Modern archaeology has led to the discovery of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources . As observed in Han miniature tomb models , but not in literary sources , the crank handle was used to operate the fans of winnowing machines that separated grain from chaff . The odometer cart , invented during Han , measured journey lengths , using mechanical figures banging drums and gongs to indicate each distance traveled . This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century AD , yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century AD . Modern archaeologists have also unearthed specimens of devices used during the Han dynasty , for example a pair of sliding metal calipers used by craftsmen for making minute measurements . These calipers contain inscriptions of the exact day and year they were manufactured . These tools are not mentioned in any Han literary sources . 
 The waterwheel appeared in Chinese records during the Han . As mentioned by Huan Tan in about 20 AD , they were used to turn gears that lifted iron trip hammers , and were used in pounding , threshing and polishing grain . However , there is no sufficient evidence for the watermill in China until about the 5th century . The Nanyang Commandery Administrator Du Shi ( d . 38 AD ) created a waterwheel @-@ powered <unk> that worked the bellows for the smelting of iron . <unk> were also used to power chain pumps that lifted water to raised irrigation ditches . The chain pump was first mentioned in China by the philosopher Wang Chong in his 1st @-@ century @-@ AD Balanced Discourse . 
 The armillary sphere , a three @-@ dimensional representation of the movements in the celestial sphere , was invented in Han China by the 1st century BC . Using a water clock , waterwheel and a series of gears , the Court Astronomer Zhang Heng ( 78 – 139 AD ) was able to mechanically rotate his metal @-@ ringed armillary sphere . To address the problem of slowed timekeeping in the pressure head of the inflow water clock , Zhang was the first in China to install an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel . Zhang also invented a device he termed an " earthquake weathervane " ( <unk> <unk> yi <unk> ) , which the British scientist Joseph Needham described as " the ancestor of all seismographs " . This device was able to detect the exact cardinal or ordinal direction of earthquakes from hundreds of kilometers away . It employed an inverted pendulum that , when disturbed by ground tremors , would trigger a set of gears that dropped a metal ball from one of eight dragon mouths ( representing all eight directions ) into a metal toad 's mouth . The account of this device in the Book of the Later Han ( Hou Han shu <unk> ) describes how , on one occasion , one of the metal balls was triggered without any of the observers feeling a disturbance . Several days later , a messenger arrived bearing news that an earthquake had struck in Longxi Commandery ( in modern Gansu Province ) , the direction the device had indicated , which forced the officials at court to admit the efficacy of Zhang 's device . 
 = = = Mathematics = = = 
 Three Han mathematical treatises still exist . These are the Book on Numbers and Computation ( Suan shu shu <unk> ) , the Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven ( Zhou bi <unk> jing <unk> ) and the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art ( Jiu <unk> <unk> shu <unk> ) . Han @-@ era mathematical achievements include solving problems with right @-@ angle triangles , square roots , cube roots , and matrix methods , finding more accurate approximations for pi , providing mathematical proof of the Pythagorean theorem , use of the decimal fraction , Gaussian elimination to solve linear equations , and continued fractions to find the roots of equations . 
 One of the Han 's greatest mathematical advancements was the world 's first use of negative numbers . Negative numbers first appeared in the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art as black counting rods , where positive numbers were represented by red counting rods . Negative numbers are used in the <unk> manuscript of ancient India , but its exact date of compilation is unknown . Negative numbers were also used by the Greek mathematician Diophantus in about 275 AD , but were not widely accepted in Europe until the 16th century AD . 
 The Han applied mathematics to various diverse disciplines . In musical tuning , Jing Fang ( 78 – 37 BC ) realized that 53 perfect fifths was approximate to 31 octaves while creating a musical scale of 60 tones , calculating the difference at <unk> ⁄ <unk> ( the same value of 53 equal temperament discovered by the German mathematician Nicholas Mercator [ 1620 – 1687 ] , i.e. 353 / 284 ) . 
 = = = Astronomy = = = 
 Mathematics were essential in drafting the astronomical calendar , a lunisolar calendar that used the Sun and Moon as time @-@ markers throughout the year . Use of the ancient Sifen calendar ( <unk> ) , which measured the tropical year at 3651 ⁄ 4 days , was replaced in 104 BC with the Taichu calendar ( <unk> ) that measured the tropical year at 365385 ⁄ 1539 days and the lunar month at 2943 ⁄ 81 days . However , Emperor Zhang later reinstated the Sifen calendar . 
 Han Chinese astronomers made star catalogues and detailed records of comets that appeared in the night sky , including recording the 12 BC appearance of the comet now known as Halley 's comet . 
 Han @-@ era astronomers adopted a geocentric model of the universe , theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere surrounding the earth in the center . They assumed that the Sun , Moon , and planets were spherical and not disc @-@ shaped . They also thought that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by sunlight , that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the Moon , and that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth . Although others disagreed with his model , Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds . 
 = = = Cartography , ships , and vehicles = = = 
 Evidence found in Chinese literature , and archaeological evidence , show that cartography existed in China before the Han . Some of the earliest Han maps discovered were ink @-@ penned silk maps found amongst the Mawangdui Silk Texts in a 2nd @-@ century @-@ BC tomb . The general Ma Yuan created the world 's first known raised @-@ relief map from rice in the 1st century AD . This date could be revised if the tomb of Qin Shi Huang is excavated and the account in the Records of the Grand Historian concerning a model map of the empire is proven to be true . 
 Although the use of the graduated scale and grid reference for maps was not thoroughly described until the published work of Pei Xiu ( 224 – 271 AD ) , there is evidence that in the early 2nd century AD , cartographer Zhang Heng was the first to use scales and grids for maps . 
 The Han @-@ era Chinese sailed in a variety of ships differing from those of previous eras , such as the tower ship . The junk design was developed and realized during Han . <unk> featured a square @-@ ended bow and stern , a flat @-@ bottomed hull or carvel @-@ shaped hull with no keel or sternpost , and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western vessels . Moreover , Han ships were the first in the world to be steered using a rudder at the stern , in contrast to the simpler steering oar used for riverine transport , allowing them to sail on the high seas . 
 Although ox @-@ carts and chariots were previously used in China , the wheelbarrow was first used in Han China in the 1st century BC . Han artwork of horse @-@ drawn chariots shows that the Warring @-@ States @-@ Era heavy wooden yoke placed around a horse 's chest was replaced by the softer breast strap . Later , during the Northern Wei ( 386 – 534 AD ) , the fully developed horse collar was invented . 
 = = = Medicine = = = 
 Han @-@ era medical physicians believed that the human body was subject to the same forces of nature that governed the greater universe , namely the cosmological cycles of yin and yang and the five phases . Each organ of the body was associated with a particular phase . Illness was viewed as a sign that qi or " vital energy " channels leading to a certain organ had been disrupted . Thus , Han @-@ era physicians prescribed medicine that was believed to counteract this imbalance . For example , since the wood phase was believed to promote the fire phase , medicinal ingredients associated with the wood phase could be used to heal an organ associated with the fire phase . To this end , the physician Zhang Zhongjing ( c . 150 – c . 219 AD ) prescribed regulated diets rich in certain foods that were thought to cure specific illnesses . These are now known to be nutrition disorders caused by the lack of certain vitamins consumed in one 's diet . Besides dieting , Han physicians also prescribed moxibustion , acupuncture , and calisthenics as methods of maintaining one 's health . When surgery was performed by the physician Hua Tuo ( d . 208 AD ) , he used anesthesia to numb his patients ' pain and prescribed a rubbing ointment that allegedly sped the process of healing surgical wounds . 
 = Fairy Queen ( locomotive ) = 
 The Fairy Queen is a steam locomotive , plying between the Indian capital of New Delhi and Alwar , in Rajasthan . It was certified by the Guinness Book of Records in 1998 as being the world 's oldest one in regular operation after being restored to haul a luxury train in order to boost tourism in Rajasthan . The Fairy Queen runs on the same basis as the Palace on Wheels , the tourist train launched in 1982 , and in 1999 was awarded a National Tourism Award . 
 The 5 ft 6 in ( 1 @,@ 676 mm ) Indian gauge locomotive was built in England in 1855 , and has a two @-@ cylinder engine with a power output of 130 horsepower ( 97 kW ) , producing a top speed of 40 kilometres per hour ( 25 mph ) . It was placed in service by the East Indian Railway Company in West Bengal , where it hauled troop trains during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , and was withdrawn from service in 1909 and displayed on a pedestal in Howrah until 1943 . Heritage status was accorded in 1972 and the locomotive was restored as an exhibit at the National Rail Museum in Delhi . Restored to full working order , in 1997 the Fairy Queen returned to commercial service for the first time in 88 years . 
 In 2011 , it was discovered that rare locomotive parts that were " as good as irreplaceable " had been looted . After a substantial rebuild , the engine was returned to working order in December 2012 .

 The locomotive was constructed by Kitson , Thompson and Hewitson at Leeds , in England , in 1855 , and reached Kolkata , then known as Calcutta , in the same year . On arrival , it was given fleet number " 22 " by its owner , the East Indian Railway Company , not receiving a name until 1895 . Initially , the 5 ft 6 in ( 1 @,@ 676 mm ) gauge locomotive was used to haul light mail trains in West Bengal , operating between Howrah and Raniganj , and during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 hauled troop trains . It was later consigned to line construction duty in Bihar , where it served until 1909 . 
 The Fairy Queen spent the next 34 years on a pedestal outside Howrah station . In 1943 , the locomotive was moved to the Railway Zonal Training School at <unk> , in Uttar Pradesh , where it served as a curiosity object for many of the students based there .

As the inscription on Express ' pedestal claimed that it was the first locomotive to operate between Howrah and Raniganj , and it was numbered " 21 " by the East Indian Railway Company , it has been claimed that Express is the older of the two . Express was restored for running in 2011 , making it a contender as the world 's oldest operating steam locomotive .

 The Indian government bestowed heritage status on the Fairy Queen in 1972 , rendering it a national treasure . It was restored and given a special spot in the newly built National Rail Museum at <unk> , in New Delhi . 
 Following the success of the Palace on Wheels , the locomotive was restored to full working order in 1997 , in preparation for its first mainline journey in 88 years and its return to commercial service on 18 July . The two @-@ day excursion saw the train plying the 143 kilometres ( 89 mi ) from New Delhi to Alwar in Rajasthan , with passengers spending an overnight stay at the Sariska Tiger Reserve . The locomotive hauled a carriage capable of carrying 60 passengers at a maximum speed of 40 kilometres per hour ( 25 mph ) , with a service car holding a generator , compressor and pantry . The operation was repeated between December and February in the following years . It was certified by the Guinness Book of Records in 1998 as the world 's oldest steam locomotive in regular operation . The following year , the train received a National Tourism Award for the most innovative and unique tourism project from Atal Bihari Vajpayee , the then Prime Minister of India . 
 In 2011 , it was discovered that rare locomotive parts that were " as good as irreplaceable " had been stolen , and the locomotive was moved to <unk> Locomotive Workshops at Chennai , in Tamil Nadu , for repair . On arrival , it was found that an estimated 50 to 60 parts had been looted , including the boiler , <unk> , <unk> and flow tubes . The Deputy Chief Mechanical Engineer at the workshops stated " What we received is a dead body , a piece of metal whose every removable part has been removed , leaving only the metal shell . The list of parts to be procured is huge . " Officials estimated that it could take at least a year to restore the engine , even if suppliers of replacement parts could be found . Following a substantial rebuild , in which the workshops had to construct the missing parts themselves , the locomotive returned to service on 22 December 2012 . 
 = History of the Yosemite area = 
 For over 3 @,@ 000 years Sierra Miwok , Mono , Paiute , and other Native American groups have lived in the central Sierra Nevada region of California . When European Americans first visited the area that would later become Yosemite National Park , a band of Native Americans called the Ahwahnechee lived in Yosemite Valley . The California Gold Rush in the mid @-@ 19th century greatly increased the number of non @-@ indigenous people in the region . Tensions between Native Americans and white settlers escalated into the Mariposa War . As part of this conflict , settler James Savage led the Mariposa Battalion into Yosemite Valley in 1851 , in pursuit of <unk> led by Chief Tenaya . Accounts from the battalion , especially from Dr. Lafayette Bunnell , popularized Yosemite Valley as a scenic wonder . 
 In 1864 , Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoia trees were transferred from federal to state ownership . Yosemite pioneer Galen Clark became the park 's first guardian . Conditions in Yosemite Valley were made more hospitable to people and access to the park was improved in the late 19th century . Naturalist John Muir and others became increasingly alarmed about the excessive exploitation of the area . Their efforts helped establish Yosemite National Park in 1890 . Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove were added to the national park in 1906 . 
 The United States Army had jurisdiction over the national park from 1891 to 1914 , followed by a brief period of civilian stewardship . The newly formed National Park Service took over the park 's administration in 1916 . Improvements to the park helped to increase visitation during this time . Preservationists led by Muir and the Sierra Club failed to save Hetch Hetchy Valley from becoming a reservoir in 1923 . In 1964 , 89 percent of the park was set aside in a highly protected wilderness area , and other protected areas were added adjacent to the park . The once @-@ famous Yosemite Firefall , created by pushing red hot embers off a cliff near Glacier Point at night , was discontinued in the mid @-@ to @-@ late 20th century along with other activities that were deemed to be inconsistent with protection of the national park . 
 = = Early history = = 
 = = = Native Americans = = = 
 Humans may have visited the Yosemite area as long as 8 @,@ 000 to 10 @,@ 000 years ago . By the time people started to settle Yosemite Valley 3 @,@ 000 years ago , vegetation and game in the region was similar to that present today ; the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada had acorns , deer , and salmon , while the eastern Sierra had pinyon nuts and obsidian . Native American groups traveled between these two regions to trade and raid . 
 Archaeologists divide the pre @-@ European American contact period of the region into three cultural phases . The Crane Flat phase lasted from 1000 BCE to 500 CE and is marked by hunting with the atl atl and the use of grinding stones . The <unk> phase lasted from 500 until 1200 , marked by a shift to using smaller rock points , indicating development and use of the bow and arrow . The Mariposa phase lasted from 1200 until contact with European Americans . 
 Trade between tribes became more widespread during the Mariposa phase , and the diet continued to improve . Paiutes , Miwok , and Monos visited the area to trade ; one major trading route went over Mono Pass and through Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake in Eastern California . 
 Paiutes were the primary inhabitants of the Yosemite and the foothills to the east during the Mariposa and historic phases . The Central Sierra Miwoks lived along the drainage area of the Tuolumne and Stanislaus Rivers , while the Paiutes inhabited the upper drainage of the Merced and Chowchilla Rivers . 
 The indigenous natives called themselves the Ah @-@ wah @-@ ne @-@ chee , meaning " dwellers in Ahwahnee . " The <unk> were decimated by a disease in about 1800 , and left the valley , although about 200 returned under the leadership of Tenaya , son of an Ahwahneechee chief . 
 Displaced Native Americans from the Californian coast moved to the Sierra Nevada during the early @-@ to @-@ mid @-@ 19th century , bringing with them their knowledge of Spanish food , technology , and clothing . Joining forces with the other tribes in the area , they raided land grant ranchos on the coast and drove herds of horses to the Sierra , where horse meat became a major new food source . 
 = = = Exploration by European Americans = = = 
 Although there were Spanish missions , pueblos ( towns ) , presidios ( forts ) , and ranchos along the coast of California , no Spanish explorers visited the Sierra Nevada . The first European Americans to visit the mountains were amongst a group led by fur trapper Jedediah Smith , crossing north of the Yosemite area in May 1827 , at <unk> Pass . 
 A group of trappers led by mountain man Joseph <unk> Walker may have seen Yosemite Valley in the autumn of 1833 . Walker approached a valley rim as he led his party across the Sierra Nevada , but he did not enter it . A member of the group , Zenas Leonard , wrote in his journal that streams from the valley rim dropped " from one lofty precipice to another , until they are exhausted in rain below . Some of these precipices appeared to us to be more than a mile high . " The Walker party probably visited either the Tuolumne or Merced Groves of giant sequoia , becoming the first non @-@ indigenous people to see the giant trees , but journals relating to the Walker party were destroyed in 1839 , in a print shop fire in Philadelphia . 
 The part of the Sierra Nevada where the park is located was long considered to be a physical barrier to European American settlers , traders , trappers , and travelers . That situation changed in 1848 after gold was discovered in the foothills west of the range . Travel and trade activity dramatically increased in the area during the ensuing California Gold Rush . Resources depended upon by local Native Americans were depleted or destroyed , and disease brought by the newcomers spread rapidly through indigenous populations . Extermination of native culture became a policy of the United States Government . 
 The first confirmed sighting of Yosemite Valley by a non @-@ indigenous person occurred on October 18 , 1849 by William P. Abrams and a companion . Abrams accurately described some landmarks , but it is uncertain whether he or his companion actually entered the valley . In 1850 , one of three brothers , Joseph , William , or Nathan Screech , became the first confirmed non @-@ indigenous person to enter Hetch Hetchy Valley . Joseph Screech returned two years later and spoke with the Native Americans living there , asking them what the name of a grass @-@ covered seed meal was and was told , " hatch <unk> . " 
 The surveying crew of <unk> W. Von Schmidt conducted the first systematic traverse of any part of the Yosemite area backcountry in 1855 , when it extended an approximation of the Mount Diablo Baseline eastward from a point west of the present park boundary , to a point south of Mono Lake . The actual route taken was 5 to 6 miles south of the actual baseline , due to topographic difficulties , including the Tuolumne River canyon at low elevations , and steep mountain slopes higher up . Nevertheless , this was the first straight line survey made across the Sierra Nevada From 1879 to 1883 large parts of the western half of the park were surveyed as part of the General Land Office survey . However , the individual contracted for the largest area , one S. A. Hanson , was later listed among those associated with the Benson Syndicate , and he combined actual with probably fabricated surveys . Topographic surveys performed by Lieutenant Montgomery M. Macomb , under George M Wheeler 's Surveys West of the 100th Meridian , were completed in the late 1870s and early 1880s . 
 = = = Mariposa Wars and legacy = = = 
 James Savage 's trading camp on the Merced River , 10 miles ( 16 km ) west of Yosemite Valley , was raided by Native Americans in December 1850 , after which the raiders retreated into the mountains . An appeal to the governor of California to put an end to this and other raids led to the formation of the Mariposa Battalion in 1851 , and the start of the Mariposa War . 
 Savage led the battalion into Yosemite Valley in 1851 , in pursuit of around 200 <unk> led by Chief Tenaya . On March 27 , 1851 , the company of 50 to 60 men reached what is now called Old Inspiration Point , from where Yosemite Valley 's main features are visible . Chief Tenaya and his band were eventually captured and their village burned , fulfilling the prophecy an old and dying medicine man had given Tenaya many years before . The Ahwahnechee were escorted by their captor , Captain John Bowling , to the Fresno River Reservation , and the battalion was disbanded on July 1 , 1851 . Life on the reservation was unpleasant and the Ahwahneechee longed for their valley . Reservation officials consented and allowed Tenaya and some of his band to return on their own recognizance . 
 A group of eight miners entered Yosemite Valley in May 1852 , and were allegedly attacked by Tenaya 's warriors ; two of the miners were killed . Regular army troops under the direction of Lt. Tredwell Moore retaliated by shooting six Ahwahneechee who were in possession of white men 's clothing . 
 Tenaya 's band fled the valley and sought refuge with the Mono , his mother 's tribe . In mid @-@ 1853 , the Ahwahneechee returned to the valley , but they subsequently betrayed the hospitality of their former Mono hosts by stealing horses that the Mono had taken from non @-@ indigenous ranchers . In return , the Monos tracked down and killed many of the remaining Ahwahneechee , including Tenaya ; Tenaya Lake is named after the fallen chief . Hostilities subsided and by the mid @-@ 1850s local European American residents started to befriend Native Americans still living in the Yosemite area . 
 Members of the battalion proposed names for the valley while they were camped at Bridalveil Meadow . The company physician who had been attached to Savage 's unit , Dr. Lafayette Bunnell , suggested " Yo @-@ sem @-@ i @-@ ty " , after what the surrounding Sierra Miwok tribes , who feared the Yosemite Valley tribe , called them . Savage , who spoke some native dialects , translated this as " full @-@ grown grizzly bear . " The term , which was possibly derived from or confused with the similar <unk> or <unk> , meaning " grizzly bear , " is the Southern Sierra Miwok word <unk> <unk> , meaning " they are killers . " Bunnell named many other local topographic features on the same trip . 
 Bunnell drafted an article about the trip , but destroyed it when a newspaper correspondent in San Francisco suggested cutting his <unk> foot ( 460 m ) height estimate for the valley 's walls in half ; the walls are in fact twice the height that Bunnell surmised . The first published account of Yosemite Valley was written by Lt. Tredwell Moore for the January 20 , 1854 , issue of the Mariposa Chronicle , establishing the modern spelling of Yosemite . Bunnell described his awestruck impressions of the valley in his book , The Discovery of the Yosemite , published in 1892 .

 Forty @-@ eight Non @-@ Indian people visited Yosemite Valley in 1855 , including San Francisco writer James Mason Hutchings and artist Thomas Ayres . Hutchings wrote an article about his experience that was published in the July 12 , 1855 , issue of the Mariposa Gazette and Ayres ' sketch of Yosemite Falls was published in late 1855 ; four of his drawings were presented in the lead article of the July 1856 and initial issue of Hutchings ' Illustrated California Magazine . The article and illustrations created tourist interest in Yosemite and eventually led to its protection . 
 Ayres returned in 1856 and visited Tuolumne Meadows in the area 's high country . His highly detailed <unk> exaggerated artwork and his written accounts were distributed nationally and an art exhibition of his drawings was held in New York City . 
 Hutchings took photographer Charles Leander Weed to Yosemite Valley in 1859 ; Weed took the first photographs of the valley 's features , which were presented to the public in a September exhibition held in San Francisco . Hutchings published four installments of " The Great Yo @-@ semite Valley " from October 1859 to March 1860 in his magazine and re @-@ published a collection of these articles in his Scenes of Wonder and Curiosity in California , which remained in print into the 1870s . 
 Carleton Watkins exhibited his 17 by 22 in ( 43 by 56 cm ) Yosemite views at the 1867 Paris International Exposition . 
 Photographer Ansel Adams made his first trip to Yosemite in 1916 ; his photographs of the valley made him famous in the 1920s and 1930s . Adams willed the originals of his Yosemite photos to the Yosemite Park Association , and visitors can still buy direct prints from his original negatives . The studio in which the prints are sold was established in 1902 by artist Harry Cassie Best . 
 Milton and Houston Mann opened a toll road to Yosemite Valley in 1856 , up the South Fork of the Merced River . They charged the then considerable sum of two dollars per person until the road was bought by Mariposa County , after which it became free . 
 In 1856 , settler Galen Clark discovered the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoia at Wawona , an indigenous encampment in what is now the southwestern part of the park . Clark completed a bridge over the South Fork of the Merced River in 1857 at Wawona for traffic headed toward Yosemite Valley and provided a way station for travelers on the road the Mann brothers built to the valley . 
 Simple lodgings , later called the Lower Hotel , were completed soon afterward ; the Upper Hotel , later renamed Hutchings House and eventually known as Cedar Cottage , was opened in 1859 . In 1876 , the more substantial Wawona Hotel was built to serve tourists visiting the nearby grove of big trees and those on their way to Yosemite Valley . Aaron Harris opened the first campground business in Yosemite in 1876 .

 Visitation and interest in Yosemite continued to grow through the American Civil War . Unitarian minister Thomas Starr King visited the valley in 1860 and saw some of the negative effects that settlement and commercial activity were having on the area . Six travel letters by Starr King were published in the Boston Evening Transcript in 1860 and 1861 ; Starr King became the first person with a nationally recognized voice to call for a public park at Yosemite . Oliver Wendell Holmes and John Greenleaf Whittier read and commented on Starr King 's letters and landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted was prompted by the warnings to visit the Yosemite area in 1863 . 
 Pressure from Starr King and Olmsted , photographs by Carleton Watkins , and geological data from the 1863 Geological Survey of California prompted legislators to take action . Senator John Conness of California introduced a park bill in 1864 to the United States Senate to cede Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees to California . 
 The bill easily passed both houses of the United States Congress , and was signed by President Abraham Lincoln on June 30 , 1864 . The Yosemite Grant , as it was called , was given to California as a state park for " public use , resort and recreation " . A board of commissioners , with Frederick Law Olmsted as chairman , was formed in September 1864 to govern the grant , but it did not meet until 1866 . 
 = = = Managing the state grant = = = 
 The commission appointed Galen Clark as the grant 's first guardian , but neither Clark nor the commissioners had the authority to evict homesteaders . Josiah Whitney , the first director of the California Geological Survey , lamented that Yosemite Valley would meet the same fate as Niagara Falls , which at that time was a tourist trap with tolls on every bridge , path , trail , and viewpoint . 
 Hutchings and a small group of settlers sought legal homesteading rights on 160 acres ( 65 ha ) of the valley floor . The issue was not settled until 1874 when the land holdings of Hutchings and three others were invalidated and the state legislature appropriated $ 60 @,@ 000 ( $ 1 @,@ 250 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) to compensate the settlers , of which Hutchings received $ 20 @,@ 000 . 
 Conditions in Yosemite Valley and access to the park steadily improved . In 1878 , Clark used dynamite to breach a recessional moraine in the valley to drain a swamp behind it . Tourism significantly increased after a Sacramento to Stockton extension of the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869 and the Central Pacific Railroad reached Merced in 1872 . 
 The long horseback ride from Merced remained a deterrent to tourists . Three stagecoach roads were built in the mid @-@ 1870s to provide better access ; <unk> Road ( June 1874 ) , Big Oak Flat Road ( July 1874 ) , and the Wawona Road ( July 1875 ) . A road to Glacier Point was completed in 1882 by John Conway , and the Great Sierra Wagon Road was opened in 1883 , which roughly followed the Mono Trail to Tuolumne Meadows . 
 Clark and the sitting commissioners were removed from office by the California Legislature in 1880 , and Hutchings became the new guardian . Hutchings in turn was replaced as guardian , in 1884 , by W. E. Dennison . Clark was reappointed as guardian in 1889 and retired in 1896 . 
 In 1900 , Oliver Lippincott became the first to drive an automobile into Yosemite Valley . Yosemite Valley Railroad , nicknamed " the short line to paradise , " arrived at nearby El Portal , California in 1907 . Numerous hiking and horse trails were cleared , including a walking path through Mariposa Grove .

 Yosemite 's first concession was established in 1884 when Mr. and Mrs. John Degnan established a bakery and store . The Desmond Park Service Company was granted a twenty @-@ year concession in 1916 ; the company bought out or built hotels , stores , camps , a dairy , a garage , and other park services . Desmond changed its name to the Yosemite National Park Company in December 1917 and was reorganized in 1920 . 
 The Curry Company was started by David and Jenny Curry in 1899 ; the couple also founded Camp Curry , now known as Curry Village . The Currys lobbied reluctant park supervisors to allow expansion of concessionaire operations and development in the area . 
 Administrators in the National Park Service felt that limiting the number of concessionaires in each national park would be more financially sound . The Curry Company and its rival , the Yosemite National Park Company , were forced to merge in 1925 to form the Yosemite Park & Curry Company ( YP & CC ) .

 = = = John Muir 's influence = = = 
 Immediately following his arrival in California in March 1868 , naturalist John Muir set out for the Yosemite area , where he found work tending to the sheep owned by a local rancher , Pat Delaney . Muir 's employment provided him with the opportunity to study the area 's plants , rocks , and animals ; the articles and scientific papers he wrote describing his observations helped to popularize the area and to increase scientific interest in it . Muir was one of the first to suggest that Yosemite Valley 's major landforms were created by large alpine glaciers , contradicting the view of established scientists such as Josiah Whitney , who regarded Muir as an amateur . 
 Alarmed by over grazing of meadows , logging of giant sequoia , and other damage , Muir changed from being a promoter and scientist to an advocate for further protection . He persuaded many influential people to camp with him in the area , such as Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1871 . Muir tried to convince his guests that the entire area should be under federal protection . None of his guests through the 1880s could do much for Muir 's cause , except for Robert Underwood Johnson , editor of Century Magazine . Through Johnson , Muir had a national audience for his writing and a highly motivated and crafty congressional lobbyist . 
 Muir 's wish was partially granted on October 1 , 1890 , when the area outside the valley and sequoia grove became a national park under the unopposed Yosemite Act . The Act provided " for the preservation from injury of all timber , mineral deposits , natural curiosities , or wonders within said reservation , and their retention in their natural condition " and prohibited " wanton destruction of the fish and game and their capture or destruction for the purposes of merchandise or profit . " 
 Yosemite National Park included the entire upper drainages of two river watersheds . Preservation of watersheds was very important to Muir , who said " you cannot save Yosemite Valley without saving its Sierran fountains . " The State of California retained control of Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees . Muir and 181 others founded the Sierra Club in 1892 , in part to lobby for the transfer of the valley and the grove into the national park . 
 = = = Army administration = = = 
 Like Yellowstone National Park before it , Yosemite National Park was at first administered by various units of the United States Army . Captain Abram Wood led the 4th Cavalry Regiment into the new park on May 19 , 1891 , and set up Camp A.E. Wood ( now the Wawona Campground ) in Wawona . Each summer , 150 cavalrymen traveled from the Presidio of San Francisco to patrol the park . Approximately 100 @,@ 000 sheep were illegally led into Yosemite 's high meadows each year . The Army lacked legal authority to arrest the herders , but instead escorted them several days ' hike from their flock , which left the sheep vulnerable . By the late 1890s sheep grazing was no longer a problem , but at least one herder continued to graze his sheep in the park into the 1920s . 
 The Army also tried to control poaching . In 1896 , acting Superintendent Colonel S. B. M. Young stopped issuing firearm permits after discovering that large numbers of game and fish were being killed . Poaching continues to be an issue in the 21st century . The Army 's administration of the park ended in 1914 . 
 Galen Clark retired as the state grant 's guardian in 1896 , leaving Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees under ineffective stewardship . Pre @-@ existing problems in the state grant worsened and new problems arose , but the cavalry could only monitor the situation . Muir and the Sierra Club continued to lobby the government and influential people for the creation of a unified Yosemite National Park . The Sierra Club began to organize annual trips to Yosemite in 1901 in an effort to make the remote area more accessible .

 U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt camped with John Muir near Glacier Point for three days in May 1903 . During that trip , Muir convinced Roosevelt to take control of the valley and the grove away from California and give it to the federal government . On June 11 , 1906 , Roosevelt signed a bill that did precisely that , and the superintendent 's headquarters was moved from Wawona to Yosemite Valley . 
 To secure congressional and State of California approval for the plan , the size of the park was reduced by more than 500 square miles ( 1 @,@ 300 km2 ) , which excluded natural wonders such as the Devils <unk> and prime wildlife habitat . The park was again reduced in size in 1906 , when logging began in an area around Wawona . Acting superintendent Major H. C. Benson said in 1908 that " game is on the decrease . Each reduction of the park has cut another portion of the winter resort of game . " The various changes meant that the park was reduced to two @-@ thirds of its original size . 
 About 12 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 @,@ 900 ha ) between the Tuolumne and the Merced big tree groves were added to the park in 1930 through land purchases by the federal government and matching funds provided by industrialist John D. Rockefeller . Another 8 @,@ 765 acres ( 3 @,@ 547 ha ) near Wawona were added in 1932 . The Carl Inn Tract , close to the Rockefeller purchase , was secured in 1937 and 1939 . 
 = = = Fight over Hetch Hetchy Valley = = = 
 San Francisco Mayor James D. Phelan hired USGS engineer Joseph B. Lippincott in 1900 to perform a discreet survey of Hetch Hetchy Valley , located north of Yosemite Valley in the national park . His report stated that a dam of the Tuolumne River in the Hetch Hetchy Valley was the best choice to create a drinking water reservoir for the city . <unk> sought water rights to the Tuolumne River and rights to build reservoirs at Hetch Hetchy and Lake Eleanor on behalf of Phelan in 1901 . These requests were rejected in 1903 by Secretary of the Interior Ethan Allen Hitchcock , who felt the application was " not in keeping with the public interest . " 
 The 1906 San Francisco earthquake tipped the balance in favor of granting the city the right to build the dam . Rights to Hetch Hetchy were granted to the City of San Francisco in 1908 by Secretary of the Interior James Rudolph Garfield , who wrote : " Domestic use is the highest use to which water and available storage basins ... can be put . " 
 A nationally publicized fight over the dam project ensued ; preservationists like Muir wanted to leave wild areas wild , and conservationists like Gifford Pinchot wanted to manage wild areas for the betterment of mankind . Robert Underwood Johnson and the Sierra Club joined the fight to save the valley from flooding . Muir wrote , " Dam Hetch Hetchy ! As well dam for <unk> the people 's cathedrals and churches , for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man . " Pinchot , who was director of the U.S. Forest Service , wrote to his close friend Roosevelt that " the highest possible use which could be made of it would be to supply pure water to a great center of population . " 
 Roosevelt 's successor , Woodrow Wilson , signed the Raker Act into law on December 13 , 1913 , which authorized construction of the dam . Hetch Hetchy Reservoir grew as the valley was flooded behind the O 'Shaughnessy Dam in 1923 . The Raker Act also gave the city the right to store water in Lake Eleanor and Cherry Lake , both located northwest of Hetch Hetchy in the park . 
 Shortly before Muir died he expressed the hope that " some compensating good must follow " from the Raker Act . The fight over the dam strengthened the conservation movement by popularizing it nationally .

 The administration of Yosemite National Park was transferred to the newly formed National Park Service in 1916 , when W. B. Lewis was appointed as the park 's superintendent . Parsons Memorial Lodge and Tioga Pass Road , along with campgrounds at Tenaya and Merced lakes , were completed the same year ; six hundred automobiles entered the east side of the park using Tioga Road that summer . The " All @-@ Weather Highway " ( now State Route 140 ) opened in 1926 , ensuring year @-@ long visitation and delivery of supplies under normal conditions . Completion of the 0 @.@ 8 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 3 km ) -long Wawona Tunnel in 1933 significantly reduced travel time to Yosemite Valley from Wawona . The famous Tunnel View is on the valley side of the tunnel and Old Inspiration Point is above it . A flood , reduced lumber and mining extraction , and greatly increased automobile and bus use forced the Yosemite Valley Railway out of business in 1945 . The present day Tioga Road , now part of California State Route 120 , was dedicated in 1961 . 
 Interpretive programs and services for national parks were pioneered in Yosemite by Harold C. Bryant and Loye Holmes Miller in 1920 . Ansel F. Hall became the first park naturalist in 1921 and served in that role for two years . Hall 's idea to have park museums act as public contact centers for interpretive programs became a model followed by other national parks in the United States and internationally . Yosemite Museum , the first permanent museum in the National Park System , was completed in 1926 . 
 The Ahwahnee Hotel , in Yosemite Valley , is a National Historic Landmark . Built in 1927 , it is a luxury hotel designed by the architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood , decorated in Native American motifs . For many years it hosted an annual pageant produced by Ansel Adams . During World War II it was used as a rehabilitation hospital for soldiers .

 Large floods covered Yosemite Valley in 1937 , 1950 , 1955 , and 1997 . These floods had a flow rate of 22 @,@ 000 to 25 @,@ 000 cubic feet ( 620 to 700 m3 ) per second , as measured at the <unk> Bridge gauging station in Yosemite Valley . 
 All the structures in Old Yosemite Village , except for the chapel , were either moved to the Pioneer Yosemite History center in Wawona or demolished during the 1950s and 1960s . Other structures in the park were also moved to the history center . Cedar Cottage , the oldest building in Yosemite Valley , was demolished in 1941 along with others , even though they had not been flooded . Little regard was given to historic preservation , as the priority was thought to be the preservation and restoration of natural scenery . 
 Congress set aside about 89 percent of the park in a highly protected wilderness area through passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964 . No roads , motorized vehicles ( except rescue helicopters and other emergency vehicles ) , or any development beyond trail maintenance are allowed in this area . The adjacent Ansel Adams Wilderness and John Muir Wilderness were also protected under the act and include regions removed from the park immediately before it was unified with the state grant in 1906 . 
 The Yosemite Firefall , in which the embers from a bonfire were pushed off a cliff near Glacier Point to create a spectacular effect , was ended in 1968 because it was deemed to be inconsistent with park values . The <unk> was occasionally performed in the 1870s and became a nightly tradition with the founding of Camp Curry .

 Broader tensions in American society surfaced in Yosemite when a large number of youths gathered in the park over the summer of 1970 , triggering a riot on July 4 after rangers tried to evict visitors from camping illegally in Stoneman Meadow . Rioters attacked the rangers with rocks , and pulled mounted rangers from their horses . The National Guard was brought in to restore order . 
 The Yosemite Park and Curry Company was bought by Music Corporation of America ( MCA ) in 1973 . In 1988 , concessionaires brought in $ 500 million ( $ 1 billion as of 2016 ) , and paid the federal government $ 12 @.@ 5 million ( $ 25 million as of 2016 ) for the franchise . Delaware North Companies became the primary concessionaire for Yosemite in 1992 . The agreement it signed with the National Park Service increased yearly park revenue from concessionaires to $ 20 million ( $ 33 @.@ 7 million as of 2016 ) . 
 In 1999 , four women were killed by Cary Stayner just outside the park . That same year a large rockslide originating at the east side of Glacier Point ended near the Happy Isles of the Merced River , creating a debris field larger than several football fields . Tourism dropped a little after those incidents , but soon returned to its previous level .

 Plans for reducing human impact on the park were released by the Park Service in 1980 . The General Management Plan specified a reduction of 17 percent in overnight accommodations , a 68 percent reduction in staff housing and removal of golf courses and tennis courts by 1990 , yet there were still 1 @,@ 300 buildings in Yosemite Valley and 17 acres ( 6 @.@ 9 ha ) of the valley floor were covered by parking lots in the late 1990s . The goals were not met , but flooding in January 1997 destroyed park infrastructure in Yosemite Valley . The Yosemite Valley Plan was later established to implement the General Management Plan and over 250 other actions . 
 = = = Forests and meadows = = = 
 The <unk> and other aboriginal groups changed the environment of the Yosemite area . Parts of valley floors were intentionally burned each year to encourage the growth of acorn @-@ bearing black oaks . Fire kept forests open , reducing the risk of ambush , and the open areas helped to expand and maintain meadows . 
 Early park guardians drained swamps , which reduced the number and extent of meadows . In the 1860s there were over 750 acres ( 300 ha ) of meadows in the valley compared to 340 acres ( 140 ha ) by the end of the 20th century . The remaining meadows are maintained by manually clearing trees and shrubs . The Park Service has prohibited driving and camping in meadows , a common practice in the 1910s to 1930s and cattle and horses are no longer allowed to roam freely in the park . 
 Fire suppression encouraged the growth of young coniferous trees , such as ponderosa pine and incense cedar ; adult conifers create enough shade to inhibit the growth of young black oak trees . By the 20th century , fire suppression and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led to the establishment of dense conifer forests where mixed and open conifer @-@ oak woodlands had previously grown . Fire suppression polices have been replaced by a fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires . Fire is especially important to the giant sequoia groves , whose seeds cannot germinate without fire @-@ touched soil . 
 Logging used to be carried out in the area . Over one @-@ half @-@ billion board feet of timber were felled between World War I and 1930 , when John D. Rockefeller , Jr. and the federal government bought out the Yosemite Lumber Company .

 Muir and the Sierra Club initially encouraged efforts to increase visitation to the park .

" 
 The first automobile entered Yosemite Valley in 1900 , but growth in car traffic did not increase significantly until 1913 , when they were first officially allowed to enter ; the next year , 127 cars entered the park .

 Half Dome is a prominent and iconic granite dome that rises 4 @,@ 737 feet ( 1 @,@ 444 m ) above the floor of Yosemite Valley . It was first climbed on October 12 , 1875 , by the Scottish blacksmith of Yosemite Valley , George C. Anderson . A rope that Anderson laid was used by six men , including 61 @-@ year @-@ old Galen Clark , and one woman , to scale the last 975 feet ( 297 m ) of Half Dome . Anderson 's rope was repaired several times and was replaced in 1919 by a stairway built by the Sierra Club . 
 Sunnyside walk @-@ in campground , better known as Camp 4 , was built in 1929 . Rock climbers , who started to scale the cliffs of Yosemite in the 1950s , camped there . In 1997 , a flood in Yosemite Valley destroyed employee housing in the valley . The Park Service wanted to build dormitories next to Camp 4 , but Tom Frost , the American Alpine Club and others succeeded in killing the plan . Camp 4 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 21 , 2003 , because of its role in the development of rock climbing as a sport .
