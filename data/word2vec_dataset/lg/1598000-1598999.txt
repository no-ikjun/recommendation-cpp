 The choice of Shevchenko as the subject for a statue was not without controversy . Opponents , such as The Washington Post editorial board , argued " the Ukrainian poet is known to only a few Americans , he is the idol of the Soviet Communist Party , he is anti @-@ Semitic and anti @-@ Polish . " Following the strongly worded editorial 's publication , there was a deluge of angry responses , including from members of Congress like Representatives Thaddeus J. <unk> of New York and Ed Derwinski of Illinois . Derwinski said erecting a memorial to Shevchenko seemed appropriate when compared with some of the other statues in the city , such as those honoring Dante , Edmund Burke , and Jose de San Martin . 
 After more than 2 @,@ 000 people gathered at the memorial site for the groundbreaking ceremony on September 21 , 1963 , there were repeated calls during the next several months for the memorial plans to be scrapped . In November , a member of the National Capital Planning Commission , which was required to approve the statue according to the congressional resolution , called for the cancellation of the memorial . The next month Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall said he wanted to review plans to construct the memorial . Attempts to derail the project ultimately failed when capital planners said they lacked the authority to stop the erection of the statue . 
 Initially Soviet Union officials , including the Soviet embassy and Ukrainian SSR representatives at the United Nations , were opposed to the memorial and demanded the U.S. State Department cancel the plans . They eventually accepted the idea and the Soviet embassy requested to be involved with the memorial 's dedication . This did not occur though because the memorial 's inscription was " carefully worded by the statue 's sponsors to embarrass the Soviet Union and to discourage Soviet delegations from laying wreaths at the memorial . "

 The statue , founded by the Bedi @-@ <unk> Art Foundry , was placed on its pedestal on June 3 , 1964 . The memorial dedication ceremony took place a few weeks later on June 27 . The day @-@ long festivities included concerts at DAR Constitution Hall and a procession of around 35 @,@ 000 people of Ukrainian descent , many wearing native clothing , marching from the Ellipse to the memorial site . The parade marchers , arriving by buses and cars decorated with stickers , flags , and blue and yellow signs , had been gathering since early in the morning . Led by Colonel William Ryback , it took four hours for all the participants to march past the White House , west on Pennsylvania Avenue , and north on 23rd Street to the memorial site . 
 There were approximately 100 @,@ 000 people in attendance at the ceremony , including delegations from Argentina , Australia , Belgium , Canada , France , Germany , and the United Kingdom , as well as U.S. government representatives and foreign ambassadors . In addition to Leo Mol , dignitaries in attendance included the following : Stepan <unk> , president of the Ukrainian People 's Republic in exile ; UCCA president Dobriansky and other leaders of Ukrainian American organizations like Ukrainian National Association president Joseph Sawyer , Archbishops Ambrose <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; U.S. Representatives <unk> , <unk> , Michael A. <unk> of Ohio , and Daniel J. Flood of Pennsylvania ; actors Jack Palance and Mike Mazurki ; and Miss World United States Michele <unk> . 
 The ceremony was opened by Dobriansky followed by a rendition of the U.S. national anthem , " The Star @-@ Spangled Banner " . <unk> then read the invocation in English and Ukrainian and Roman Smal @-@ <unk> , president of the memorial committee , spoke about the significance of the monument . Perhaps the most prominent attendee was former U.S. President Eisenhower , who was chosen to unveil the statue . Before he did so , Eisenhower was cheered for several minutes as the crowd chanted " We Like Ike ! " Following a 12 @-@ minute speech , Eisenhower unveiled the statue , calling Shevchenko a Ukrainian hero and stated : " For my hope is that your magnificent march from the shadow of the Washington Monument to the foot of the statue of Shevchenko will here kindle a new world movement in the hearts , minds , words and actions of men ; a never @-@ ending movement dedicated to the independence and freedom of peoples of all captive nations of the entire world . " He also said the statue represented " millions of oppressed " in Eastern Europe and " gives them constant encouragement to struggle forever against Communist tyranny , until , one day final victory is achieved , as it most surely will be . " Following the unveiling , the Ukrainian Choral Societies of America led the crowd in a musical rendition of Shevchenko 's poem Testament . Additional speeches were then made by several U.S. Representatives and Archbishop Ioan <unk> of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church gave the benediction . The ceremony concluded with the crowd singing Ukraine 's national anthem , <unk> ne <unk> Ukraina ( English : Ukraine Has Not Yet Died ) .

 A stainless steel urn containing soil from Shevchenko 's grave was installed at the base of the memorial in May 1965 . A commemorative book which includes a brief history of the monument , a list of the memorial fund donors , and other documents related to the site were also installed in the base . The memorial was the site of protest rallies held by Ukrainian Americans who objected to the Soviet Union 's policies . It has been described as " a symbol of Ukrainian independence and a rallying point of the Ukrainian @-@ American community . " Ukrainian dignitaries still visit the memorial , such as President Viktor Yushchenko , who laid a wreath at the statue in April 2005 .

 = William Stanley ( inventor ) = 
 William Ford Robinson Stanley ( 2 February 1829 – 14 August 1909 ) was a British inventor with 78 patents filed in both the United Kingdom and the United States of America . He was an engineer who designed and made precision drawing and mathematical instruments , as well as surveying instruments and telescopes , manufactured by his company " William Ford Stanley and Co . Ltd . " 
 Stanley was a skilled architect who designed and founded the UK 's first Trades school , Stanley Technical Trades School ( now Harris Academy South Norwood ) , as well as designing the Stanley Halls in South Norwood . Stanley designed and built his two homes . He was a noted philanthropist , who gave over £ 80 @,@ 000 to education projects during the last 15 years of his life . When he died , most of his estate , valued at £ 59 @,@ 000 , was bequeathed to trade schools and students in south London , and one of his homes was used as a children 's home after his death , in accordance with his will . 
 Stanley was a member of several professional bodies and societies ( including the Royal Society of Arts , the Royal Meteorological Society , the Royal Astronomical Society and the British Astronomical Association ) . Besides these activities , he was a painter , musician and photographer , as well as an author of a variety of publications , including plays , books for children , and political treatises .

 William Stanley was born on Monday 2 February 1829 in Islington , London , one of nine children of John Stanley ( a mechanic and builder ) and his wife , Selina Hickman , and a direct descendant of Thomas Stanley , the 17th @-@ century author of History of Philosophy . He was baptised on Wednesday 4 March 1829 at St Mary ’ s Church , Islington . At the age of 10 Stanley started going regularly to a day school run by a Mr Peil until he was 12 . From the age of 12 until he was 14 , his maternal uncle William Ford Hickman paid for his education at a different school . Despite having limited formal learning , Stanley taught himself mathematics , mechanics , astronomy , music , French , geology , chemistry , architecture and theology . He attended lessons in technical drawing at the London Mechanics ’ Institution ( now called Birkbeck College ) , where he enrolled in 1843 , attending engineering and phrenology lessons . 
 While living in Buntingford between 1849 and 1854 , Stanley founded a literary society with a local chemist . They charged a subscription of five shillings a year . This was spent on books to form a library which grew to 300 volumes . They had many guest speakers , and on one occasion Lord Lytton , the author of The Last Days of Pompeii , came to address the Society on Pompeii . Being " intensely interested " in architecture , he submitted a design for a competition in The Builder magazine , but did not win . 
 = = = Starting work = = = 
 In 1843 , at the age of 14 , Stanley 's father insisted that he leave school and help him in his trade . Stanley worked in his father 's unsuccessful building business , becoming adept at working with metal and wood , later to obtain employment as a plumber / drainage contractor and joiner in London . He joined his father in 1849 at an engineering works at Whitechapel , working as a Pattern Maker 's <unk> where he invented the steel wheel spider @-@ spokes . His father discouraged him from seeking a patent for this invention . For the following five years , he was in partnership with his maternal uncle ( a Mr Warren ) , a builder , at Buntingford . 
 = = = Family life = = = 
 In 1854 , Stanley fell in love with a girl in Buntingford , Bessie Sutton , but her family refused to let them marry . On 2 February 1857 ( Stanley 's 28th birthday ) , he married Eliza Ann Savory . They lived " above the shop " , as they could only afford to rent four rooms in the same street as his shop . Five years later , the couple moved to Kentish Town , later moving to South Norwood in the mid @-@ 1860s . The couple adopted Stanley 's niece Eliza Ann and another child , Maud Martin , whose father and brother drowned at sea .

 Stanley acted upon a remark made by his father in 1854 about the high cost and poor quality of English drawing instruments compared to those imported from France and Switzerland , and started a business making mathematical and drawing instruments . At first he rented a shop and parlour at 3 Great Turnstile , Holborn , and began the business with £ 100 capital . He invented a new T @-@ square which improved the standard one and became universally used . A cousin , Henry Robinson , joined him with a capital of £ 150 , but died in 1859 . Stanley stopped using the name Robinson and changed his signature as a consequence of being robbed of his cheque book during the early days of his business . 
 Stanley produced a ' Panoptic <unk> ' in 1855 , which was financially successful . <unk> had sold for five shillings each – Stanley discovered a simpler method to make them , which enable him to sell them for one shilling . He was able to take an additional shops at 3 – 4 Great Turnstile and 286 High Holborn , as well as a skilled assistant . He did not patent the Panoptic , so it was soon copied around the world , but he had sold enough to provide the capital required to manufacture scientific instruments . In 1861 he invented a straight line dividing machine for which he won first prize in the 1862 International Exhibition in London . Stanley brought out the first catalogue of his products in 1864 . By the fifth edition , Stanley was able to list important customers such as several government departments , the Army , the Royal Navy , railways at home and abroad , and London University . From 1865 , he worked on improving the elegance and stability of surveying instruments , especially the theodolite , whose construction he simplified . It had a rotating telescope for measuring horizontal and vertical angles and able to take sights on prominent objects at a distance . The component parts were reduced to fewer than half of the 226 used in the previous version , making it lighter , cheaper and more accurate .

 Stanley designed and set up a factory in 1875 or 1876 ( called The Stanley Works , it was listed in the 1876 Croydon <unk> as Stanley Mathematical Instruments ) in Belgrave Road near Norwood Junction railway station , which produced a variety of instruments for civil , military , and mining engineers , prospectors and explorers , architects , meteorologists and artists , including various Technical drawing tools . The firm moved out of the factory in the 1920s , with the factory being occupied by a joinery firm until , following a fire , it was converted into residential use in 2000 . 
 In South Norwood , Stanley designed and built his two homes <unk> , at 74 – 76 Albert Road and Cumberlow Lodge in Chalfont Road . Cumberlow Lodge was originally Pascall ’ s large <unk> dating from the early part of the 19th century , and subsequently a dairy farm . When it closed the 6 acres ( 0 @.@ 024 km2 ) of land was purchased in 1878 by Stanley . It was written into his will that the building should only be used as a children 's home , and it was used for this purpose for over a century . In 1963 , ownership was transferred to the London Borough of Lambeth and child murderer Mary Bell was housed there for a short time , until the local residents protested and she was removed to Wales . It was knocked down in 2006 before it could become a listed building .

 By 1881 , Stanley was employing 80 people and producing 3 @,@ 000 technical items , as detailed in his catalogue . A few years later , in 1885 , Stanley was given a gold medal at the International Inventors Exhibition at Wembley . The rapid growth of his business led to the opening of branches at Lincoln 's Inn , at London Bridge and at South Norwood . His 1890 catalogue shows that the company were selling Magic Lanterns , with a variety of slides including such subjects as the Siege of Paris ( 1870 – 1871 ) , the travels of Dr Livingstone and Dante 's Inferno , as well as improving stories for children such as Mother 's Last Words and The Drunkard 's Children , while in the catalogue for 1891 , Stanley refers to the company having 17 branches , with over 130 workmen .

 Stanley decided in 1901 to build and set up Stanley Technical Trades School , the first of its kind in the country . The school was designed to educate boys between the ages of 12 and 15 in general studies , as well as trade . It was made to Stanley ’ s own design and included an astronomy tower , and opened in 1907 . When it was presented to the public in 1907 , it had an endowment valued at £ 50 @,@ 000 . It was later renamed as Stanley Technical School ( now Harris Academy South Norwood ) . The William F. Stanley Trust ( originally The Stanley Foundation ) was set up as a charitable Trust to assist with the management of the Stanley Technical Trades School . On 23 November 2006 , Lady Harris ( wife of Philip Harris , Baron Harris of Peckham , founder of the Harris Federation ) and David Cameron ( at the time , the leader of the Conservative Party and the Leader of the Opposition ) placed a time capsule to recognise the contribution of Stanley to South Norwood . The capsule included a letter from Cameron , a copy of the speech given by William Stanley , on the opening of the Stanley Technical Trades School on 26 March 1907 , two reference books ( William Stanley the Man ; William Stanley ’ s School ) , as well as artefacts from both Stanley Technical High School for Boys and the Harris Federation of schools . 
 Stanley Halls ( in South Norwood ) were opened on 2 February 1903 by Charles Ritchie , 1st Baron Ritchie of Dundee at a cost of £ 13 @,@ 000 ( as Stanley Public Hall ) to provide the local community with a public space for plays , concerts and lectures . It was the first building in Croydon to have electricity . In 1904 a clock tower and a hall were added . In 1993 , a blue plaque was installed on a wall of Stanley Halls by English Heritage .

" The first 14 carriages were filled with family and dignitaries , whilst the 15th carried the domestic staff from Cumberlow . The cortege went to <unk> End Cemetery in Beckenham at walking pace and was met at the gates of the Cemetery by scholars from the School and members of staff from the firm . He was buried in the part of the Cemetery reserved for those who attended St. John 's Church , Upper Norwood . His tomb has a fine portrait carved in stone . When his widow died in 1913 , she was placed in the tomb beside Stanley . There were obituaries in several national and local newspapers and journals , including The Times , The Norwood Herald , The Norwood News , The Engineer , The Electrical Review , The Electrician , Engineering and The Journal of the Geological Society of London .

After the war , the company continued to expand , participating in many large project – for example , RMS Queen Mary and Royal Navy ships used the company 's compasses and other navigational instruments . The company went into liquidation in July 1999 – the main factors were not investing the proceeds of the sale of the factory land to buying new machinery , the high value of the pound affecting export orders , and the loss of Ministry of Defence orders following the end of the Cold War .

 SMS Nürnberg ( " His Majesty 's Ship Nürnberg " ) , named after the Bavarian city of Nuremberg , was a Königsberg @-@ class light cruiser built for the German Imperial Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) . Her sisters included Königsberg , Stettin , and Stuttgart . She was built by the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel , laid down in early 1906 and launched in April of that year . She was completed in April 1908 . Nürnberg was armed with ten 4 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) guns , eight 5 @.@ 2 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) guns , and two submerged torpedo tubes . Her top speed was 23 @.@ 4 knots ( 43 @.@ 3 km / h ; 26 @.@ 9 mph ) . 
 Nürnberg served with the fleet briefly , before being deployed overseas in 1910 . She was assigned to the East Asia Squadron . At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , she was returning to the German naval base at Tsingtao from Mexican waters . She rejoined the rest of the Squadron , commanded by Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee , which steamed across the Pacific Ocean and encountered a British squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock . In the ensuing Battle of Coronel on 1 November , the British squadron was defeated ; Nürnberg finished off the British cruiser HMS Monmouth . A month later , the Germans attempted to raid the British base in the Falkland Islands ; a powerful British squadron that included a pair of battlecruisers was in port , commanded by Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee . Sturdee 's ships chased down and destroyed four of the five German cruisers ; HMS Kent sank Nürnberg , with heavy loss of life .

 Nürnberg was ordered under the contract name " Ersatz Blitz " and was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel on 16 January 1906 . At her launching on 28 August 1906 , the mayor of her namesake , Dr. Georg von <unk> , christened Nürnberg , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 10 April 1908 . The ship was 116 @.@ 8 meters ( 383 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 13 @.@ 3 m ( 44 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 24 m ( 17 @.@ 2 ft ) forward . She displaced 3 @,@ 902 t ( 3 @,@ 840 long tons ; 4 @,@ 301 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines powered by eleven coal @-@ fired Marine @-@ type boilers . These provided a top speed of 23 @.@ 4 kn ( 43 @.@ 3 km / h ; 26 @.@ 9 mph ) and a range of approximately 4 @,@ 120 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 630 km ; 4 @,@ 740 mi ) at 12 kn ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . Nürnberg had a crew of 14 officers and 308 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with ten 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 guns in single pedestal mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , six were located amidships , three on either side , and two were side by side aft . The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees , which allowed them to engage targets out to 12 @,@ 700 m ( 41 @,@ 700 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 500 rounds of ammunition , for 150 shells per gun . The ship was also equipped with eight 5 @.@ 2 cm SK L / 55 guns with 4 @,@ 000 rounds of ammunition . She was also equipped with a pair of 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes submerged in the hull on the broadside . The ship was protected by an armored deck that was 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick amidships . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides .

 After serving briefly with the fleet in German waters , Nürnberg was sent overseas in 1910 . She was assigned to the Kaiserliche Marine 's East Asia Station at Tsingtao as part of Admiral Count Maximilian von Spee 's East Asia Squadron . During the Mexican revolution she was positioned off the west coast of Mexico . After being relieved by Leipzig , Nürnberg returned to her home base at Tsingtao . In the summer of 1914 , Nürnberg was steaming across the Pacific to relieve Leipzig on the Mexico station . With the outbreak of World War I , Spee planned a return of his squadron to Germany , sailing through the Pacific , rounding Cape Horn , and then forcing his way north through the Atlantic . On 6 August 1914 , Nürnberg rendezvoused with the core of the East Asia Squadron , the armored cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau , in Ponape . Spee decided the best place to concentrate his forces was Pagan Island in the northern Marianas Islands , a German possession in the central Pacific . All available colliers , supply ships , and passenger liners were ordered to meet the East Asia Squadron there . On 11 August , Spee arrived in Pagan ; he was joined by several supply ships , as well as Emden and the auxiliary cruiser Prinz Eitel Friedrich . 
 The four cruisers then departed the central Pacific , bound for Chile . On 13 August the captain of the Emden , Commodore Karl von Müller , persuaded Spee to detach his ship for commerce raiding . The ships again coaled after their arrival at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 20 August . On 6 September Spee detached Nürnberg , along with the tender Titania , to cut the British cable system at Fanning Island . The cruiser flew a French ensign to deceive the defenders , and succeeded in destroying the station on 7 September . Nürnberg then rejoined the fleet at Christmas Island. later that day . In order to keep the German high command informed of his activities , Spee sent Nürnberg on 8 September to Honolulu to send word through neutral countries . Spee chose the ship because the British were aware she had left Mexican waters , and so her presence in Hawaii would not betray the movements of the entire East Asia Squadron . She was also ordered to contact German agents to instruct them to prepare coal stocks in South America for the squadron 's use . Nürnberg brought back news of the Allied conquest of the German colony at Samoa . 
 On 14 September , Spee decided to use his two armored cruisers to raid the British base at Apia ; he sent Nürnberg to escort the squadron 's colliers to the rendezvous location . At the Battle of Papeete on 22 September , Nürnberg and the rest of the East Asia Squadron bombarded the colony . During the bombardment , the French gunboat Zélée was sunk by gunfire from the German ships . Fear of mines in the harbor prevented von Spee from seizing the coal that lay in the harbor . By 12 October , the squadron had reached Easter Island . There they were joined by Dresden and Leipzig , which had sailed from American waters . After a week in the area , the ships departed for Chile . 
 = = = Battle of Coronel = = = 
 To oppose the German squadron off the coast of South America , the British had scant resources ; under the command of Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock were the armored cruisers HMS Good Hope and Monmouth , the light cruiser Glasgow , and the auxiliary cruiser Otranto . This flotilla was reinforced by the elderly pre @-@ dreadnought battleship Canopus and the armored cruiser Defence , the latter , however , did not arrive until after the Battle of Coronel . Canopus was left behind by Cradock , who likely felt that her slow speed would prevent him from bringing the German ships to battle . On the evening of 26 October , the East Asia Squadron steamed out of Mas a Fuera , Chile , and headed eastward . Spee learned that Glasgow had been spotted in Coronel on the 31st , and so turned towards the port . 
 He arrived on the afternoon of 1 November , and to his surprise , encountered Good Hope , Monmouth , and Otranto as well as Glasgow . Canopus was still some 300 miles ( 480 km ) behind , with the British colliers . At 17 : 00 , Glasgow spotted the Germans ; Cradock formed a line with Good Hope in the lead , followed by Monmouth , Glasgow , and Otranto in the rear . Spee decided to hold off on engaging the British until the sun had set more , at which point the British ships would be silhouetted by the sun . Nürnberg was some distance behind the rest of the German squadron , and joined the ensuing action later ; she had been delayed from searches of neutral steamers . Arriving late to the battle , Nürnberg found the drifting Monmouth and finished her off with gunfire at a range of around 550 to 900 m ( 600 to 980 yd ) . 
 On 3 November , Nürnberg , Scharnhorst , and Gneisenau steamed into Valparaiso , Chile to resupply their coal and other supplies . They were limited to 24 hours per international law , which also allowed only three warships in any neutral port at a time ; the other two cruisers , Leipzig and Dresden , had to return to Mas a Fuera . After regrouping at Mas a Fuera , Spee had decided to raid British shipping routes in the South Atlantic . On 21 November , the East Asia Squadron put into St. Quentin Bay to coal ; the crews piled up coal on the ships ' decks to allow them to steam all the way to the Port of Santa Elena , where Spee had arranged for colliers out of Montevideo to meet them on 5 December . 
 = = = Battle of the Falkland Islands = = = 
 In the aftermath of the Battle of Coronel , Spee decided to attack the British base at Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands . Nürnberg and Gneisenau were to raid the harbor , destroy the wireless station , and burn the coal stocks , while the rest of the squadron screened for British warships . Spee was under the incorrect impression that the Falkland Islands were undefended . The British had detached a pair of battlecruisers , Invincible and Inflexible , and four cruisers , under the command of Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee , to track down Spee 's squadron and defeat it in return for Coronel . 
 When Nürnberg and Gneisenau approached the islands early on 8 December , the old battleship Canopus opened fire and drove them off . The Germans were surprised to see the warships in the harbor , and Spee decided to retreat . The East Asia Squadron steamed away at 22 kn ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) in a single file line ; Nürnberg was the second ship in the line , between Gneisenau and Scharnhorst . Sturdee ordered his ships to raise steam and pursue the Germans . His battlecruisers caught up and opened fire at 12 : 50 ; Spee decided that he could hold off the battlecruisers with Scharnhorst and Gneisenau to allow the three light cruisers time to escape . In response , Sturdee sent his light cruisers to chase down Nürnberg , Dresden , and Leipzig . 
 HMS Kent chased Nürnberg down ; at 17 : 00 , Nürnberg opened fire at extreme range , approximately 11 @,@ 000 m ( 12 @,@ 000 yd ) . Kent was unable to reply until the range fell to 6 @,@ 400 m ( 7 @,@ 000 yd ) , at which time she began firing salvos rapidly . Nürnberg turned to port in order to bring her entire broadside into action , which was mimicked by Kent . The two ships steered on converging courses , and the distance between the two cruisers dropped to 2 @,@ 700 m ( 3 @,@ 000 yd ) . By that time , Kent 's shells were raining down on Nürnberg and were causing major damage . A serious fire broke out forward at 18 : 02 , and by 18 : 35 , she was dead in the water and had ceased firing . Kent temporarily ceased fire , but after noticing Nürnberg was still flying her battle ensigns , resumed combat . After five more minutes of shelling , Nürnberg struck her colors , and Kent 's crew prepared to lower lifeboats to pick up survivors . 
 Only twelve men were picked up before the ship capsized and sank at 19 : 26 , and five of them died after being rescued . Among the dead was one of Spee 's sons , Otto von Spee . In total , 327 officers and men were killed in the battle . In the course of the engagement , Nürnberg had hit Kent thirty @-@ eight times , but did not cause significant damage . One shell struck one of Kent 's casemate guns and ignited the propellant charges inside , but the magazine was flooded before the fire could destroy the ship . The sinking was commemorated in a painting entitled The Last Man by Hans <unk> , which depicted a German sailor waving the Imperial ensign as Nürnberg slipped beneath the waves . 
 = Gelou = 
 Gelou ( Romanian : <unk> ; Hungarian : Gyalu ) was the Vlach ruler of Transylvania at the time of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin around 900 AD , according to the Gesta Hungarorum . Although the Gesta Hungarorum , which was written after 1150 , does not indicate the enemies of the conquering Hungarians ( Magyars ) known from earlier annals and chronicles , it refers to local rulers — including Gelou — who are not mentioned in other primary sources . Consequently , historians debate whether Gelou was a historical person or an imaginary figure created by the unidentified author of the Gesta Hungarorum . In Romanian historiography , Gelou is one of three early @-@ 10th @-@ century Romanian dukes with lands in the intra @-@ Carpathian region of present @-@ day Romania . 
 The Gesta Hungarorum describes pre @-@ conquest Transylvania as a country rich in salt and gold , which was raided by Turkic peoples — " Cumans and Pechenegs " — before the arrival of the Magyars . Archaeological research indicates that a people who cremated their dead inhabited the regions of the Transylvanian salt mines from the seventh to the ninth centuries . Although excavated weapons suggest a military elite , none of the early @-@ medieval Transylvanian fortresses uncovered can be reliably dated before the 10th century . The Gesta Hungarorum states that Gelou 's duchy was inhabited by Vlachs and Slavs ; most toponyms recorded by the chronicler in connection with Gelou 's duchy are of Magyar origin . According to the Gesta Hungarorum , Tétény ( or Tuhutum ) , who was one of seven Magyar chieftains , defeated Gelou 's army at the Mezeş Gates and Gelou was killed at the <unk> River as he fled towards his unnamed fortress . Gelou 's subjects then yielded to Tuhutum without further resistance . 
 = = Background = = 
 What is known about Gelou comes from the Gesta Hungarorum ( The Deeds of the Hungarians ) , the earliest surviving Hungarian chronicle . The Gesta was written during the second half of the 12th century or the early 13th century by an unidentified author , now known as Anonymus . It describes the Magyar conquest of the Carpathian Basin around 900 . 
 The Magyars , settled in the Pontic @-@ Caspian steppe by the 830s , began a westward migration after their defeat by a coalition of Pechenegs and Bulgarians in about 895 . They crossed the Carpathian Mountains , invading the surrounding area . Gelou is a local ruler described in the Gesta Hungarorum as an opponent of the invading Magyars . Anonymus did not write about Simeon I of Bulgaria , Svatopluk I of Moravia or other opponents known from contemporary sources , instead chronicling Magyar battles with local rulers ( including Gelou , Menumorut and Salan ) not mentioned in other primary sources . 
 = = Transylvania on the eve of the Hungarian conquest = = 
 The nomadic Avars dominated the Carpathian Basin from about 567 . In Transylvania , archaeological evidence attributed to them around 630 is clustered in the region of the salt mines at <unk> , Ocna Mureș and Turda , and along the rivers Mureș and Someș . The cremation cemeteries of the Mediaș group , a sedentary population , were also concentrated around the salt mines in the seventh to ninth centuries . Although the Mediaș cemeteries have been attributed to Slavs , according to Madgearu " the presence of Romanians in this context should not be ruled out " . The names of many rivers in Transylvania — for instance , Bistrița ( " swift " ) , Cerna ( " black " ) , Dobra ( " good " ) and <unk> ( " thorny " ) — are of Slavic origin , indicating the historical presence of a Slavic @-@ speaking population . According to Madgearu , two eighth @-@ century spurs unearthed at <unk> Mică and <unk> Mare " suggest the existence of cavalry troops of Slavs and , perhaps , Romanians in Avar service " ( since Avar spur use is uncertain ) . 
 The Avar Khaganate disintegrated after the Franks invaded its western regions three times between 791 and 803 . A stone column erected during the reign of Omurtag of Bulgaria commemorates the 829 death of a Bulgarian commander named <unk> at the river Tisa , indicating that the Bulgarians invaded the eastern regions of the one @-@ time khaganate . According to the Annals of Fulda , in 894 Emperor Arnulf sent envoys to the Bulgarians to " ask that they should not sell salt to the Moravians " ; this demonstrates that the Bulgarians controlled , at a minimum , the roads between the Transylvanian salt mines and Moravia . 
 According to Kurdt <unk> , István Bóna and other historians , Dridu B pottery unearthed in the Alba Iulia region which was similar to ceramic utensils found along the lower Danube demonstrates that the Bulgarians expanded their authority over this region . Other historians ( including Victor Spinei ) reject this theory , saying that Dridu B ceramics can only prove cultural influences from the Balkan Peninsula . The so @-@ called " Ciumbrud group " of cemeteries , which were also unearthed near Alba Iulia , yielded earrings and clothing accessories analogous to finds from the lower Danube region and Moravia . Spurs , weapons and other Frankish objects unearthed at <unk> , <unk> and other Transylvanian sites demonstrate ninth @-@ century trade with the Carolingian Empire ; similar spurs were also commonly used in Bulgaria and by 10th @-@ century Magyars . 
 According to historians Vlad Georgescu , Ioan @-@ Aurel Pop and Alexandru Madgearu , the existence of a ninth @-@ century Vlach polity in the Carpatho @-@ Danubian region is verified by the Gesta Hungarorum and contemporary sources . Alfred the Great 's translation of the Historiae Adversus Paganos — a fifth @-@ century work by Orosius — referred to " the Dacians , who were formerly Goths " and lived east of the Moravians and the " Vistula country " . The 11th @-@ century Persian scholar Gardizi , who studied the works of the late ninth @-@ century al @-@ Jayhani , wrote about the <unk> — " a people of Rûm who are all Christians " — who inhabited the lower Danube and the Carpathians . Pop identifies them as Romanians , but Bóna and Kristó consider them Bulgarians because <unk> was the Bulgarians ' Hungarian exonym . An Armenian geographical work mentions " an unknown country called Balak " north of Bulgaria . According to Pop and Georgescu , this demonstrates that a Vlach country existed in the region at the end of the ninth century . Manuscript studies indicate that the reference to Balak was interpolated after 1000 , with the original text describing the " large country of Dacia " and its 25 Slavic tribes . According to the early @-@ 12th @-@ century Russian Primary Chronicle , although the Slavs were the first settlers west of the Carpathians , the Volokhs seized their territory . The Volokhs were expelled in turn by the Magyars , who " took their lands and settled among the Slavs " . Many scholars , including Georgescu and Madgearu , identify the Volokhs as Vlachs fighting the invading Magyars . Other historians , including Kristó and Dennis Deletant , say that the context indicates that these Volokhs were Franks driven out of the March of Pannonia by the Magyars . 
 Although Romanian scholars have identified about a dozen Transylvanian fort sites in Gelou 's duchy , none can be definitively dated before the turn of the ninth and tenth centuries . The forts at Dăbâca and <unk> were destroyed between the last decades of the 10th century and the first half of the 11th , but their existence before 900 is unproven . At Dăbâca , " the evidence published so far , albeit poorly , does contain evidence of a ninth @-@ century occupation of the site " , according to archaeologist Florin Curta . Curta mentions two pairs of bell @-@ shaped pendants , found outside the fort , which are similar to 9th @-@ century Moravian artefacts . An other Romanian archaeologist , Alexandru Madgearu , writes that the bell @-@ shaped pendants were only made after around 965 , because similar jewellery was found at sites dated between the last third of the 10th century and the first half of the 11th century . Pottery finds suggest that the fortress at Cluj @-@ <unk> may have been built during the ninth or tenth century . Early @-@ medieval forts at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> Silvaniei and <unk> were built at the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries , and the fort at <unk> even later . Legends identify the ruins of forts at <unk> , Gilău and <unk> as Gelou 's , but they were built during the Iron Age . According to Vlad Georgescu , more than 40 excavated Transylvanian sites can be identified as settlements in Gelou 's duchy .

 = = = Gelou and his duchy = = = 
 According to Anonymus , " Slavs , Bulgarians , Vlachs , and the shepherds of the Romans " inhabited the Carpathian Basin when the Magyars invaded the territory . The chronicler describes Transylvania ( terra <unk> , " the land beyond the woods " ) as a rich country with salt mines and gold @-@ yielding rivers , inhabited by " Vlachs and Slavs " when the Magyars arrived , and records the names of five Transylvanian rivers or mountain passes . Most — Almaş , <unk> , <unk> and Mezeş — are of Hungarian origin . In the Gesta Hungarorum Gelou is described as " a certain Vlach " and " prince of the Vlachs " , indicating that the Vlachs were considered the dominant Transylvanian population . 
 According to Anonymus , Gelou " was not steadfast and did not have around him good warriors " . The Vlachs and Slavs of Transylvania were " the basest of the whole world " because " they had nothing else for arms than bows and arrows " ; Transylvanian weakness was the result of frequent raids by " the Cumans and Pechenegs " . According to Ioan Aurel Pop , Anonymus ' description of Gelou 's subjects indicates a sedentary people called to arms . Carlile Aylmer Macartney writes that the Blasii and <unk> words for Vlachs and Pechenegs and the reference to their " bows and arrows " suggest that Anonymus borrowed the text from a work describing the route of the Third or Fourth Crusade across the Balkans ; the late @-@ 12th @-@ century Historia de expeditione Friderici <unk> refers to Vlachs and <unk> and their bows and arrows . Based on Anonymus 's narrative , Sălăgean says that Gelou 's polity was small compared with the other five mentioned in the Gesta Hungarorum . 
 = = = Conquest of Transylvania = = = 
 Anonymus and the late 13th @-@ century Simon of Kéza wrote that the Magyars bypassed Transylvania after crossing the northern Carpathians . However , 14th @-@ century Hungarian chronicles preserve a tradition contradicting these narratives . In the Illuminated Chronicle , the Magyars first arrived in Transylvania ( Erdelw ) with their conquest , " remain [ ing ] quietly in Erdelw and rest [ ing ] their herds " before moving further west . 
 The Gesta Hungarorum recounts a meeting of three Hungarian chieftains — <unk> ( or Tuhutum ) , Szabolcs and Tas — after their victory over Menumorut , who is described as lord of Bihor . They decided that " the border of the realm of Prince Árpád " ( the head of the Magyars ) " should be at the Mezeş Gates " , forcing the local population to build a stone @-@ and @-@ timber enclosure at the new border . Tétény soon sent a spy , " father <unk> <unk> " , to reconnoitre the land east of the Mezeş Gates . The spy informed him of Transylvania 's wealth and its ruler 's weakness . Before the invasion , Tétény " sent his envoys " to Árpád for permission . With Árpád 's consent , Tétény hurried to the Mezeş Gates ; according to Madgearu , his attack was " clearly targeted toward the salt mine district " of Transylvania . 
 Gelou " gathered his army and rode speedily " to the border to stop the invaders . Tétény crossed the forest in one day , forcing Gelou to retreat to the Almaş River and fight the Magyars there . The next day , Tétény divided his army and " sent one part a little way upstream " to cross the Almaş and surprise Gelou . Gelou was defeated , with many of his men killed or captured . Although he fled from the battlefield towards " his castle beside the Someş River " , Tétény 's soldiers chased and killed him on the banks of the <unk> River , near the place where the village Gilău ( which was first mentioned in the 13th century ) is located . When they heard about their lord 's death the inhabitants of Transylvania conceded , acknowledging Tétény as their new lord . They swore an oath of loyalty to him at a place later named <unk> ( in Hungarian , <unk> , which derived from <unk> , meaning " oath " in Hungarian , according to Anonymus ) . Anonymus ends his account of the Hungarian conquest of Transylvania by saying that Tétény governed Transylvania " peacefully and happily from that day , but his posterity possessed it only up to the times of the holy King Stephen " ( who conquered the province around 1000 ) . 
 = = In modern historiography = = 
 The Gesta Hungarorum 's reliability — particularly regarding Gelou , Glad , Menumorut and the other rulers described as fighting the conquering Magyars — has been debated by scholars since the publication of the chronicle during the late 18th century . Most Romanian historians ( including Vlad Georgescu , Alexandru Madgearu and Victor Spinei ) believe that Anonymus ' story of the three dukes and their realms is reliable . According to Florin Curta , Romanian archaeologists " made every possible effort ... to prove that the Gesta was a reliable source for the medieval history of ( Romanian ) Transylvania " during the excavations at Dăbâca ( Gelou 's assumed seat ) between the late 1960s and 1980s , but they were " embarrassed that no substantial evidence was found to prove the Gesta right " . Madgearu says that Anonymus ' " account about the conquest " of Transylvania " combines data taken from oral tradition with invented facts " , but " Gelou was a real person and his name could be considered authentic " . Spinei also writes that most reports in the Gesta Hungarorum " are not inventions , but they have a real support , even if here and there some anachronisms occurred . " He cites the role of the Cumans as an example , saying that the Hungarian word translated by Anonymus as " Cumans " ( kun ) originally referred to any nomadic Turkic tribe . Other historians ( including István Bóna , Dennis Deletant , Pál Engel and Gyula Kristó ) write that Anonymus had no real knowledge of the Carpathian Basin ( including Transylvania ) at the time of the Hungarian conquest and invented all the opponents of the Hungarians because he needed characters to be defeated by the conquerors . According to this view , Gelou is one of a half @-@ dozen " imaginary figures " — including <unk> , Menumorut and Zobor — named by Anonymus for a river , hill or settlement . If this theory is true , Gelou was named after Gilău ( Gyalu in Hungarian ) , a Transylvanian village in which Gelou dies in the Gesta . According to Tudor Sălăgean , the village of Gilău was apparently named for the duke . Zoltán <unk> says that the names of the village and the duke may have Hungarian or Turkic origins .

 The Merle Reskin Theatre is a performing arts venue located in the Loop community area of Chicago , Illinois . Originally named the Blackstone Theatre , it was founded in 1910 . The Merle Reskin Theatre is now part of DePaul University , although it is still used for events not affiliated with the university . It serves as the home of the Chicago Playworks for Families and Young Audiences series produced by The Theatre School . 
 The building was designed by Marshall and Fox and developed by Tracy C. Drake and John Drake of Drake Hotel fame on the former site of Timothy Blackstone 's mansion . The theatre has a rich history of live performances that have traditionally been touring productions of hit and prize @-@ winning shows . 
 = = Building = = 
 The architects who designed the new theatre in 1910 were Benjamin Marshall and Charles Fox of the firm Marshall and Fox , who also designed the adjacent Blackstone Hotel in 1909 . As with the hotel , the theatre took its name from Timothy Blackstone , whose mansion had previously occupied the site . The original address was on Hubbard Court , which was later renamed Seventh Street , and renamed once again to East Balbo Drive , the current name . The building is six stories tall and built in a French Renaissance style . Constructed only seven years after the Iroquois Theater Fire , the theater was required to be fireproof and the management claimed the auditorium could be cleared in three minutes . Seating capacity was 1 @,@ 400 people until 1988 , when renovations to reinstate the orchestra pit and to create seating for handicapped persons reduced the seat count to 1 @,@ 325 . 
 The developers of both the Blackstone Hotel and Blackstone Theatre were Tracy C. Drake and John Drake , better known as developers and proprietors of the Drake Hotel . Their father , John Drake ( 1826 @-@ 1895 ) had been a business partner of Blackstone 's . The building of the Blackstone Theatre directly resulted in the shuttering of an older , nearby theatre , the Olympia . 
 = = Blackstone Theatre Company = = 
 In an era when most entertainment was performed live on stage , the opening of a new theatre was considered so newsworthy that major newspapers reported on it . The proposed opening of the Blackstone was even noted by the New York Times , which wrote in mid @-@ July 1909 that " ... The new Blackstone Theatre , soon to be erected on Hubbard Place in Chicago ... [ will ] have a large seating capacity , and is to be equipped with every modern theatrical device . The stage is to be patterned on that of the New Amsterdam Theatre in this city [ New York ] ... " The Chicago Tribune also announced the up @-@ coming event , and in a front page story , the newspaper elaborated on what the Times had reported . The new theatre would feature the productions of Charles Frohman , who would operate the theatre jointly with impresarios Klaw & Erlanger ; the three had incorporated under the name " Blackstone Theatre Company " ( which was part of their larger Theatrical Syndicate , formed in 1896 ) . The July 1909 Tribune article also pointed out that this new theatre would be an ornate " movie palace " , able to seat about 1 @,@ 200 people and costing in excess of half a million dollars to build . The Blackstone Theatre officially opened on December 31 , 1910 , with the premiere of a Chicago playwright George Ade 's newest play " U.S. Minister Bedloe . " It was a comedy that starred William H. Crane , and the critics were impressed by the play and by the beauty of the venue . 
 The Blackstone was managed by Harry J. Powers , a Chicago businessman with extensive experience in the theatre : he had worked his way up from his early days as an usher to ultimately become one of Mr. Erlanger 's most trusted associated ; Powers remained as the Blackstone 's manager throughout its first two decades . The Blackstone 's first productions featured some of that era 's best known performers and playwrights — for example , after " U.S. Minister Bedloe " came a David Belasco production , " The Return of Peter Grimm " , starring David Warfield . Many of the productions had already been well received in New York before coming to the Blackstone , such as another play that featured comic actor William H. Crane , " The Senator Keeps House . " But while some of these productions were the equal of the version that played in New York , Tribune theatre critic Hammond observed on several occasions that the Chicago companies lacked the biggest stars . Despite this , the touring companies that performed at the Blackstone tended to do a good job and Hammond praised them for their " effective " productions . This trend of presenting touring company versions would continue in later years , when most of the performances at the Blackstone were plays which had already won the Pulitzer Prize or the Tony Award , and were presented by touring companies from New York . 
 During the first decade of operation , the Blackstone Theatre featured a number of unique productions . Among them were the performances of the Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon Players . Under the direction of F.R. Benson , they offered fourteen of Shakespeare 's plays in two weeks during early November 1913 . Also noteworthy was a presentation of George Bernard Shaw 's " Pygmalion " in 1914 ; performances by the Boston Opera Company , featuring Mlle. Anna Pavlova in 1916 and Louis N. Parker 's " Disraeli . " And during periods of time when there was no play being performed , the Blackstone opened its doors to events sponsored by civic and fraternal organizations such as the Elks or Chicago 's University Club . When Big Sisters was still a new organization , it held one of its first benefits at the Blackstone . The Blackstone was also the home to a large women 's suffrage rally and conference in 1916 ; in attendance were 1 @,@ 200 suffragists from all over the United States . And keeping up with the times , some of the performances from the stage of the Blackstone were heard on Chicago @-@ area radio station <unk> , thanks to station owner Charles <unk> , who thought it was a good idea to use the theatre for live broadcasts , and began doing so in early 1925 . 
 Because the Blackstone Theatre was a touring theatre , many actors appeared there who would not have otherwise had that opportunity if the venue had specialized in new productions . Some of the actors who graced the stage of the Blackstone include William Gillette , Ethel Barrymore , John Barrymore , Helen Hayes , Ruth Gordon , Katharine Cornell , Cornelia Otis Skinner , and Spencer Tracy . During the 1920s the Blackstone presented 60 plays by playwrights such as George Bernard Shaw , Eugene O 'Neill , Seán O 'Casey , Sir Arthur Wing Pinero , Richard Sheridan , Ben Jonson , Oliver Goldsmith , Frank Craven , Ring Lardner , and George M. Cohan .

 At the end of 1930 , it was announced that the Blackstone Theatre Company was terminating its lease . Mr. Erlanger had died in March , the country was in the midst of the Depression , and newspaper reports remarked on how many businesses were suffering . Building owners John and Tracy Drake managed the theatre for a year before foreclosure loomed in 1932 . In 1934 , they leased the theatre to <unk> 's Incorporated , although this group only lasted a year . 
 The Blackstone was saved in the 1930s by the Federal Theatre Project , which leased the theatre in 1936 and continued to use it for rehearsals and productions until the program was abolished by Congress in 1939 . During this period , the Blackstone played host to original plays . 
 In 1940 , the theater was rented by Oscar <unk> , who staged " Life with Father " starring Lillian Gish , which opened in February and ran for more than a year . The following year , Buddy Ebsen starred in " Good Night Ladies ! " , which ran for 100 weeks . From 1942 through 1945 , the theatre was run by Slavin Amusement Company .

 In 1945 , a reconstituted Blackstone Theatre Company managed the hall until 1948 when the Shubert Brothers bought the theatre . With the rise of other forms of entertainment , such as television , attendance at live theaters declined and the Shubert Organization scaled back the Blackstone 's season from 28 weeks to as few as 14 weeks each year . 
 1959 saw the premiere of Lorraine Hansberry 's " A Raisin in the Sun . " Although the play was successful , after four weeks it left Chicago for New York . Around the same time , a renaissance in Chicago theatre was taking place on the city 's north side . 
 The Blackstone was dark from 1986 until August 1988 , when it reopened to Lily Tomlin 's one woman show " The Search For Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe . " At this time , the Shubert Organization decided it was time to divest itself of all Chicago theatres except for the Shubert Theatre on Monroe Street .

 When the Shubert Organization decided to divest the majority of its Chicago theatres , the Blackstone Theatre building was offered to DePaul University . Although DePaul 's Theatre School began officially performing in the Blackstone on March 21 , 1989 , with a production of The Misanthrope by Molière , it had an earlier production of " The Phantom Tollbooth " . The Theatre School 's main performance space is the Merle Reskin Theatre . Each year The Theatre School presents the Chicago Playworks series as well as The Theatre School Showcase , which both run throughout the academic year at the Merle Reskin Theatre . Chicago Playworks presents works intended for families and young audiences , while the Showcase series offers contemporary plays and classics . 
 In 1992 , Harold and Merle Reskin made a sizable donation to the Theatre School and on November 20 , the theatre was renamed the Merle Reskin Theatre . Merle Reskin ( née <unk> ) had spent five years as a professional actress , portraying Ensign Janet MacGregor in " South Pacific " on Broadway and appearing with Etta Moten . She gave up her career upon marrying Reskin in 1955 ; however , she spent thirty years as the Midwest Regional <unk> for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts .

 When war broke out in 1941 , Voroshilov was not equipped with any radars , but she received a number of British Lend @-@ Lease radars by 1944 .

 Voroshilov was laid down at the Marti South shipyard in Nikolayev on 15 October 1935 ; the second of the Project 26 , to use their industrial designation , Kirov @-@ class cruisers . She was launched on 28 June 1937 , but she had to wait for her Soviet @-@ built machinery to be delivered before she was completed on 20 June 1940 . On 23 June 1941 Voroshilov covered Soviet destroyers bombarding <unk> , after the Germans attacked the Soviet Union , and was slightly damaged by a mine exploded by the destroyer <unk> 's paravanes . She bombarded Axis troops near Odessa on 19 September with 148 180 mm shells and was transferred to Novorossiysk shortly afterwards . On 2 November the ship was bombed in harbor by Junkers Ju 88 bombers of Kampfgeschwader 51 . She was hit twice ; one hit started a fire in # 3 magazine that was extinguished by water flooding in from the second hit . Voroshilov had to be towed to Poti for repairs , which lasted until February 1942 . She shelled Axis positions near Feodosiya on 19 March and 3 April 1942 , but was damaged by fragments from bombs from Ju 88s on 10 April and had to return to Batumi for minor repairs . 
 On 8 and 11 May she provided fire support for Soviet troops around Kerch and the Taman Peninsula . On 27 May one of her turbines broke down , while helping to transfer the 9th Naval Infantry Brigade from Batumi to Sevastopol , and required repairs lasting until 24 July 1942 . On 29 November 1942 she was damaged by nearby mine explosions while bombarding <unk> with 46 180 mm and 57 100 mm shells , but managed to return to Poti under her own power . Just after her repairs were completed she assisted Soviet forces landing behind German lines at Malaya Zemlya with 240 180 mm shells at the end of January 1943 . On 17 February the ship transferred from Poti to Batumi . 
 Voroshilov was withdrawn from active operations , however , after the loss of three destroyers that were attempting to interdict the German evacuation of the Taman Bridgehead to air attack on 6 October 1943 . This loss caused Stalin to forbid the deployment of large naval units without his express permission which was not granted during the rest of the war . The ship was transferred to Novorossiysk on 18 August 1944 and to Sevastopol on 5 November . She was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 8 July 1945 .

 Voroshilov was inspected in 1946 and found unsatisfactory , but she was given routine servicing . She began her postwar modernization in April 1954 , but the Navy reevaluated the scope of the work in 1955 and deemed it insufficient to create a fully modern ship . Unlike her half @-@ sister Maxim Gorky , she was selected for conversion as a testbed for missile development as Project 33 on 17 February 1956 . The conversion process was prolonged , as her armament was removed and she received an entirely new superstructure and masts . She consequently was not recommissioned as OS @-@ 24 until 31 December 1961 . The ship was modernized under Project <unk> from 11 October 1963 to 1 December 1965 . Her final conversion was to a floating barracks on 6 October 1972 and she was redesignated as PKZ @-@ 19 . Voroshilov was sold for scrapping on 2 March 1973 .

 Amy Lou Adams ( born August 20 , 1974 ) is an American actress and singer . She began her career on stage performing in dinner theatre and went on to make her feature film debut in Drop Dead Gorgeous ( 1999 ) . After moving to Los Angeles , she made several appearances on television and in B movies before portraying the part of Frank Abagnale 's girlfriend in Steven Spielberg 's Catch Me If You Can ( 2002 ) . Her breakthrough role came in the 2005 independent film Junebug , in which she played a young pregnant woman , for which she received critical acclaim and her first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress . 
 In 2007 , Adams starred as a princess in the Disney animated musical film Enchanted , a critical and commercial success . She received her second Oscar nomination for playing a nun in the 2008 film Doubt . Adams received two more Academy Award nominations for her supporting roles in the 2010 sports drama The Fighter and the 2012 psychological drama The Master . She achieved further success in 2013 , portraying Lois Lane in Man of Steel and a troubled con artist in David O. Russell 's crime film American Hustle . The latter won her a Golden Globe Award and garnered her a fifth Oscar nomination , her first in the Best Actress category . In 2014 , she portrayed Margaret Keane in Big Eyes , for which she won a second Golden Globe Award . Adams reprised the role of Lois Lane in 2016 's Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice , her highest @-@ grossing release . 
 Adams is the recipient of two Golden Globe Awards , and has received five nominations each from the Academy Award and BAFTA Award ceremonies . She was named one of 100 most influential people by Time magazine in 2014 . She is married to the artist Darren Le Gallo , with whom she has one child . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Adams was born on August 20 , 1974 in Vicenza , Veneto , Italy , the fourth of seven children of American parents Kathryn ( née Hicken ) and Richard Adams . She has four brothers and two sisters . Her father is a U.S. Army veteran and was stationed at Caserma Ederle at the time of her birth . After years of moving from base to base , Adams 's family settled in Castle Rock , Colorado , when Adams was eight years old . Following his Army discharge , her father sang professionally in restaurants and her mother became a semi @-@ professional bodybuilder . Until her parents ' divorce in 1985 , Adams was raised in the LDS Church . Regarding her religious upbringing , Adams said , " I can 't speak for everybody , but I know it instilled in me a value system I still hold true . The basic ' Do unto others ... ' — that was what was hammered into me . And love . " 
 During her years at Douglas County High School , Adams sang in the school choir and trained as an apprentice at a local dance company with ambitions of becoming a ballerina . Her parents had hoped that she would continue her athletic training , which she gave up to pursue dance , as it would have given her a chance to obtain a college scholarship . Adams later reflected on her decision not to go to college : " I wasn 't one of those people who enjoyed being in school . I regret not getting an education , though . " After graduating from high school , she moved to Atlanta with her mother . Deciding that she was not gifted enough to be a professional ballerina , she entered musical theater , which she found was " much better suited to [ her ] personality . " She said that ballet was " too disciplined and too restrained and I was always told off in the chorus lines " and her body at the time was " just wrecked from dancing all these years . " 
 When she turned eighteen , Adams supported herself by working as a greeter at a Gap store while performing in community theater . For a few weeks after graduating from high school , she took her first full @-@ time job as a hostess at Hooters , a fact that became her " entire press career " for a while . Adams left the job three weeks later after having saved enough money to buy her first car . She later admitted , " So there was definitely an innocence to my interpretation of what Hooters was about . Though I did learn , quickly , that short shorts and beer don 't mix ! "

 Adams began working professionally as a dancer at Boulder 's Dinner Theatre , Country Dinner Playhouse and Heritage Square Music Hall . There , she was spotted by a Minneapolis dinner theater director , Michael Brindisi , in 1995 . Adams relocated to Chanhassen , Minnesota , and worked at the Chanhassen Dinner Theatres for the next three years . While she was off work nursing a pulled muscle , she auditioned for the satirical 1999 comedy Drop Dead Gorgeous , which was being filmed in Minnesota , and was cast in her first film role . Adams moved to Los Angeles in January 1999 . Describing her first year there as her " dark year " and " bleak , " she recalled that she would " pine for that time " at Chanhassen because she " really loved that security and schedule , " and said , " The people I worked with there were also a great family to me . " Shortly after arriving in Los Angeles , she was cast in Fox Network 's television series spin @-@ off of Cruel Intentions , Manchester Prep , in the role of Kathryn <unk> . The series did not live up to the network 's expectations and following numerous script revisions and two production shutdowns , it was canceled . The filmed episodes were then re @-@ edited to be released as the direct @-@ to @-@ video film , Cruel Intentions 2 . 
 From 2000 to 2002 , Adams appeared in a series of small films like Psycho Beach Party , while guest @-@ starring on television series such as That ' 70s Show , Charmed , The Office , Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Smallville and The West Wing . She appeared in Steven Spielberg 's Catch Me If You Can as Brenda Strong , a nurse with whom Frank Abagnale , Jr . ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) falls in love . It was , in Spielberg 's words , " the part that should have launched her career , " but she was unemployed for a year after that . However , Adams said , " It was the first time I knew I could act at that level with those people . To be believed in by Steven Spielberg . … it was a huge confidence booster . " In 2004 , she starred in The Last Run as well as voicing characters on the animated television series King of the Hill . She was also cast as a regular in the television series , Dr. Vegas , in the role of Alice Doherty but was later fired after a contract dispute . 
 = = = 2005 – 2007 = = = 
 Prior to leaving Dr. Vegas , she had received the script for the low @-@ budget independent film Junebug and auditioned for the role of Ashley <unk> , a young , cheerful and talkative pregnant woman . Director Phil Morrison explains his decision to cast Adams : " Lots of people looked at Ashley and thought , ' What 's the sorrow she 's masking ? ' To me , the fact that Amy didn 't approach it from the angle of ' What 's she covering up ? ' was key . " The film was shot in 21 days in Winston @-@ Salem , North Carolina . During that time , Adams turned 30 and was worried about her film career : " I thought maybe I should move to New York , maybe I should do something else . It wasn 't that I was quitting or making a dramatic statement . It was more like maybe this just wasn 't a good fit . " On the experience of making Junebug , Adams said , " It was really empowering . At the end of the summer I was unemployed but I was happy and I was proud . I was like , you know what , I 'm done with being pushed around . " Junebug premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival with Adams winning a Special Jury Prize for her performance . 
 After the February 2005 theatrical release of The Wedding Date , in which Adams appeared alongside Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney , Junebug was released in theaters by Sony Pictures Classics later in the year , in August . Adams earned critical accolades for her work in Junebug ; Carina Chocano of Los Angeles Times noted , " Adams 's performance in a role that could have easily devolved into caricature is complex and nuanced . " Joe Leydon of Variety commented , " Partly due to her character 's generosity of spirit , but mostly due to her own charisma , Adams dominates pic with her appealing portrayal of a nonjudgmental optimist savvy enough to recognize the shortcomings of others , but sweet enough to offer encouragement , not condemnation . " She received several awards for Best Supporting Actress including the National Society of Film Critics award and the Independent Spirit Award . She was also nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award and an Academy Award . The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences invited Adams to become a member in 2006 . 
 Although Junebug had a limited audience , Adams 's critically acclaimed performance in the film helped to increase interest in her acting career . Adams went on to appear in films like Standing Still and Talladega Nights : The Ballad of Ricky Bobby , and played the recurring guest role of Katy on the television series The Office . After providing the voice for Polly Purebred in Walt Disney Pictures ' Underdog , Adams starred in Disney 's 2007 big @-@ budget animated / live @-@ action feature film , Enchanted . The film , which co @-@ stars Patrick Dempsey , Idina Menzel , Susan Sarandon and James Marsden , revolves around Giselle , who is forced from her hand @-@ drawn animated world to real @-@ life New York City . Adams was among 300 or so actresses who auditioned for the role of Giselle , but she stood out to director Kevin Lima because her " commitment to the character , her ability to escape into the character 's being without ever judging the character was overwhelming . " 
 Enchanted was a commercial success , grossing more than $ 340 million worldwide . Her performance was well received by critics . Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun @-@ Times commented that Adams was " fresh and winning , " Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe stated that she " demonstrates a real performer 's ingenuity for comic timing and physical eloquence . " She garnered a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy , a Critics ' Choice Award nomination for Best Actress , and the Saturn Award for Best Actress . Three of the film 's songs were nominated for Best Original Song at the 80th Academy Awards . Adams performed one of the songs , " Happy Working Song " , live on stage during the Oscar ceremony . " That 's How You Know , " originally performed by Adams in the film , was sung by Kristin Chenoweth at the ceremony . In an interview , Adams remarked that the song was " perfect " for Chenoweth since Chenoweth " was a huge inspiration for how [ she ] approached Giselle . " 
 The success of Enchanted increased Adams 's media exposure during the 2007 – 08 film awards season . As well as appearing on the covers of Interview , Elle and the Hollywood issue of Vanity Fair , which named her as one of the " 10 fresh faces of 2008 , " Adams hosted the seventh episode of the 33rd season of Saturday Night Live in March 2008 . In the episode , she played various characters , including Heidi Klum , as well as singing " What is this Feeling " from Wicked in a mock battle with SNL cast member Kristen Wiig during the opening monologue . Adams appeared in Charlie Wilson 's War as Bonnie Bach , the title character 's administrative assistant . On the experience of making the film , Adams said , " It was so much fun . Just to be on that set and learn from these people and get to watch Philip Seymour Hoffman and Tom Hanks do these amazing scenes together , directed by Mike Nichols , it was for me like going to school . " Adams 's next project was Sunshine Cleaning playing a single mother who starts her own crime scene clean @-@ up business in order to make enough money to send her son to a private school . The film premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and received mixed reviews . When it received a limited theatrical release in March 2009 , it was generally well received . Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a positive review , saying , " The play of emotion on Amy Adams 's face is the main reason to see Sunshine Cleaning . " 
 = = = 2008 – 2012 = = = 
 Her first theatrically released film of 2008 was the 1939 @-@ set film Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day , in which she plays <unk> Lafosse , an aspiring American actress living in London whose life is changed after meeting a governess named Miss Pettigrew , played by Frances McDormand . While the film received generally favorable reviews , Adams 's role was noted to be similar to her joyful and naïve characters in Junebug and Enchanted . Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times stated that " Adams is amazingly adept at playing smart playing dumb . " Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that " Adams more or less reprises her princess from Enchanted , only with a beguiling touch of ditzy naughtiness . " When asked whether she is in danger of being typecast , Adams responded , " Not at this point . … Right now I 'm just doing what I enjoy and I 've done some different films , I 've done some different types of roles . I 've done drama this year , we had a film at Sundance ( Sunshine Cleaning ) , but I enjoy playing upbeat characters , I really do because you take your characters home with you whether you intend to or not . " In another interview , Adams said , " I think I just respond to those kinds of characters . … They 're so layered , and I love the fact that they 've made this choice to be joyful . … I really identify with that sense of hope . " She noted that before dyeing her naturally blonde hair red , she mostly played the role of " the bitchy girl . " 
 In late 2008 , Adams starred in Doubt , an adaptation of John Patrick Shanley 's play of the same name , as the young and innocent Sister James alongside Meryl Streep , Philip Seymour Hoffman and Viola Davis . After being informed of the project by her Sunshine Cleaning co @-@ star , Emily Blunt , Adams pursued the role of Sister James but was told that it had already been offered to another actor . Shanley eventually cast Adams in the role because " she 's got this Ingrid Bergman thing going on , this luminosity . You see a good person struggling in this complicated world . She 's fiercely intelligent but has this peculiar innocence about her . She has a beautiful face of light . " On acting alongside Streep and Hoffman , Adams revealed that there was " a sense of uncertainty , a sense of doubt , a sense of wanting to please these amazing actors . " The film was well received by critics , while Adams 's role was noted to be the " least @-@ showy " among the four major parts . Although her performance was criticized by Manohla Dargis of The New York Times as " unsteady , " Todd McCarthy of Variety commented that " Adams does all anyone could with the role of a nice young nun . " Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle wrote , " Adams provides one of the film 's singular advantages . She takes the role of Sister James , which onstage seemed little more than a sounding board for Sister Aloysius , and turns the young nun into someone quite specific and lovely . " Adams was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the 81st Academy Awards , the 66th Golden Globe Awards , the 15th Screen Actors Guild Awards , and the 62nd British Academy Film Awards . 
 Adams 's next role was as Amelia Earhart in Night at the Museum 2 : Battle of the Smithsonian , opposite Ben Stiller . The film premiered over the 2009 Memorial Day weekend and topped the U.S. box office with a gross of $ 15 @.@ 3 million on its first day , beating Terminator Salvation . Although the film received " mixed or average reviews , " Adams 's performance was praised by most critics . Among those to give it a positive review , Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune thought that the film " radically improves whenever Amy Adams pops up as aviatrix Amelia Earhart … she 's terrific — a sparkling screen presence " ; and Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that " Battle of the Smithsonian has plenty of life . But it 's Adams who gives it zing . " On the other hand , Ty Burr of The Boston Globe disliked the film , describing Adams 's Earhart as " a flighty pill with no resemblance to the woman herself . " While Lael Loewenstein of Variety thought Adams was " trying a bit too hard , " Roger Ebert commented that she was the only actor who surpassed the material . The film 's director , Shawn Levy , says of her , " I don 't know that there 's a better actress in her generation . … I mean , there are other big female actors , but someone who can do Doubt and Julie & Julia , and Night at the Museum 2 , all in the same year ? Her range is almost unparalleled . It 's a huge part of why we feel that this movie is even better than the first . " That same year Adams starred in Julie & Julia alongside her Doubt co @-@ star Meryl Streep as Julia Child , with Adams as government secretary Julie Powell , who decides to cook all of the recipes in Child 's Mastering the Art of French Cooking . Carrie <unk> of the Philadelphia Inquirer said that the film showed Adams " at her most winsome " and that " Adams is superb . " 
 In 2010 , Adams began the new decade with roles in two films : the romantic comedy Leap Year and The Fighter , in which she portrayed Charlene Fleming , the aggressive and gritty girlfriend of boxer " Irish " Micky Ward . The Best Picture nominated @-@ film received critical praise for its actors in which Adams starred alongside Mark Wahlberg , Christian Bale and Melissa Leo . Adams later said about being cast in The Fighter that the director , David O. Russell , said , " ' Oh you are so not a princess type — we 'll have to do something about that ! I just want to expose that side of you , and give you the opportunity to shed the whole princess thing , because that isn 't who you are — it 's just one aspect of the work you 've done . " She won acclaim for her work . Joe Morgenstern of Wall Street Journal wrote that she 's " as tough , tender , smart and funny as she was ethereal and delightful in Enchanted . What an actress , and what range ! " For her role in The Fighter , Adams was nominated for the BAFTA Award , Broadcast Film Critics Association Award , two Screen Actors Guild Awards , Golden Globe and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress losing the latter three awards to her co @-@ star Leo . In 2011 , she again worked with Disney , starring in the acclaimed film The Muppets alongside Jason Segel and The Muppets ; in the film , she returned to singing .

Adams received some of the best reviews of her career for her performance in Paul Thomas Anderson 's The Master . In the film , Adams plays Peggy Dodd , the ruthless and manipulative wife of a religious organization leader played by Philip Seymour Hoffman .

With four supporting @-@ Oscar nominations ( Junebug , Doubt , The Fighter , The Master ) , Adams fully earns the spotlight she inhabits here .

 Damageplan was an American heavy metal band from Dallas , Texas , formed in 2003 . Following the demise of their previous group Pantera , brothers Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul Abbott wanted to start a new band . The pair recruited former Diesel Machine and Halford guitarist Pat Lachman on vocals , and later Bob Zilla on bass . Damageplan released their only studio album New Found Power in the United States on February 10 , 2004 , which debuted at number 38 on the Billboard 200 , selling 44 @,@ 676 copies in its first week . 
 While Damageplan was promoting the album at a concert on December 8 , 2004 , at the Alrosa Villa in Columbus , Ohio , a man named Nathan Gale climbed on stage and killed lead guitarist Darrell and three others , and wounding another seven , before being shot dead by police officer James Niggemeyer . Although no motive was found , some witnesses claimed Gale blamed the brothers for Pantera 's breakup and believed that they had stolen his lyrics . The band 's manager confirmed there are unreleased Damageplan recordings , although they have not surfaced , and the band has not performed since the incident . Abbott and Zilla have joined the band Hellyeah , and Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic .

 By 2003 , guitarist Dimebag Darrell and drummer Vinnie Paul Abbott were not pleased with the difficulties heavy metal band Pantera was experiencing . Abbott described the performance level of Pantera 's vocalist , Phil Anselmo , as " hit and miss , depending on what type of chemicals he was on . " Following the release of Pantera 's 2000 album Reinventing the Steel , Anselmo and bassist Rex Brown started to focus on their side projects and did not discuss or record any further Pantera material , while Darrell and Vinnie wanted to continue to write and play music . They thought it was time to move on and , upon disbanding Pantera , began writing new material . 
 A demo of the song " Crawl " was sent to former Halford guitarist Pat Lachman who auditioned as vocalist . Lachman was hired , and New Found Power was formed in early 2003 with former Jerry Cantrell guitarist Shawn Matthews on bass initially , who was replaced after the album recording with the brothers ' tattoo artist , Bob Zilla . When writing music , Vinnie claimed ; " we put no boundaries on it ... we wanted it to be very diverse " , and Darrell said " We wanted to stretch out and expand our capabilities to their fullest . " The band changed its name to Damageplan and decided to name the first album New Found Power . 
 = = = New Found Power = = = 
 The single " Save Me " debuted on American radio on January 26 , 2004 and the band 's debut album , New Found Power , was released in the United States on February 10 , 2004 . The album was recorded at the brothers ' backyard studio , Chasin ' Jason in Arlington , Texas , where previous Pantera albums were recorded . Abbott found that during recording everyone was willing to contribute and " put 100 % effort into it " , while with Pantera he found it difficult to get Anselmo in the recording studio . Corey Taylor of Slipknot , Zakk Wylde of Black Label Society and Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains made guest appearances on the tracks " Fuck You " , " Soul Bleed " , and the bonus track " Ashes To Ashes " respectively , and Sterling Winfield handled co @-@ production duties . 
 New Found Power sold 44 @,@ 676 copies in its first week to debut at number 38 on the Billboard 200 . The album received mixed reviews from music critics ; Christine Klunk of PopMatters commented " I 'm not in the least bit interested in where this band goes or what new and exciting ways they 'll think of to abuse the listeners , " while Johnny Loftus of AllMusic felt it was a " blazing new beginning " . 
 Alice in Chains ' vocalist / guitarist Jerry Cantrell attended a Thanksgiving party hosted by the brothers . Darrell and Vinnie had a demo of the first song they wrote titled " Ashes to Ashes " . Lachman insisted it was on the " backburner " until Cantrell showed interest . The band entered the brothers ' backyard studio with Cantrell to record " Ashes to Ashes " . Although the song was not completed in time to be featured on New Found Power , it was included on the Japanese version and the soundtrack The Punisher : The Album . To promote New Found Power , the band toured with Hatebreed , Drowning Pool , and Unearth on the second installment of the Headbangers Ball .

 On December 8 , 2004 , the band was on a tour at Alrosa Villa , a Columbus , Ohio nightclub . Moments into the concert , Nathan Gale , a former U.S. marine , climbed onto the stage and shot Dimebag Darrell in the head multiple times . Head of Security for the band Jeffery " Mayhem " Thompson engaged in a hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat with Nathan Gale , which allowed Vinnie Abbott and other members to escape ; Thompson was also killed . A fan named Nathan Bray attempted to give CPR to Jeffrey Thompson and Dimebag Darrell ; he was killed by the shooter too . Erin <unk> , a roadie , also a former U.S. marine , was killed when he charged at Nathan Gale while he was reloading . Once the police arrived , an officer named James Niggemeyer approached the stage from the side and saw Nathan Gale holding a gun to a hostage . James Niggemeyer killed him with a single shotgun blast to the head . 15 shots were fired by the shooter , and an additional 36 rounds were found on him . 
 A police investigation did not find a motive behind the shooting , although Nathan Gale 's mother said that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and that he believed the brothers had stolen his lyrics while trying to steal his identity too . She did not know if her son took the medication he was given for his condition , but was proud of his military service following his discharge , and had given him the Beretta <unk> that was used in the attacks . Major Jason Johnston , a marine corps spokesman at The Pentagon , was unable to comment on Nathan Gale 's discharge . 
 A foundation called The Dimebag Darrell Memorial Fund was created after the incident , which donated its profits to cover medical expenses of drum technician John Brooks and tour manager Chris <unk> , who were injured on December 8 . A public memorial service for Darrell took place on December 14 , 2004 at Arlington Convention Center in Arlington , Texas . Many musicians paid tribute to Darrell on message boards and at live performances . 
 In May 2005 , Niggemeyer was called before a grand jury , which was convened by the Franklin County prosecutor 's office to examine the actions taken that night , a standard practice when deadly force is used . The jury found there was no wrongdoing on Niggemeyer 's part . Franklin County prosecutor Ron O 'Brien commented , " There was little doubt [ the shooting ] was lawful , given the 200 eyewitnesses and the circumstances that surrounded the shooting . Nevertheless , we still have an independent body review the facts " . Niggemeyer was nominated for a bravery award on the TV show America 's Most Wanted .

 In a 2005 interview , Damageplan manager Paul Bassman said unreleased recordings before Darrell 's death were near completion . He commented , " Vinnie Paul has said there will be a follow @-@ up album down the road , as Dime would have wanted his music to be heard . " Rumors circulated of another album , although nothing has been released . 
 Following the events of December 8 , 2004 , Abbott was unsure if he wanted to continue playing music . He was invited to join Hellyeah , which included members of Mudvayne and Nothingface , but declined the offer . However , bassist Jerry Montano repeatedly called Abbott and he accepted to join the project as he thought " Everybody had their head in the right place . " Hellyeah released its debut album on April 10 , 2007 . One week later , Zilla joined the band as its new bassist , after Montano left due to " personal reasons " . The album was recorded at Abbott 's backyard studio , Chasin ' Jason , where New Found Power was recorded . 
 Vocalist Lachman joined The Mercy Clinic , which aided the grieving process . He commented , " you have to get back on the horse . You could easily let a decade go by and not do anything . I 'm happy to have walked away with my life after the situation I was thrown into . But , I mean , what do you do ? I 'm a musician . I 'm going to make music . What Dime would have told me was , ' You make music , motherfucker . Get back on it . Do what you do . ' So , that 's what I did . " Before the shooting , Phil Anselmo made the statement " Dimebag deserves to be severely beaten " in the December 2004 edition of Metal Hammer . He denied making the comments and apologized , although Abbott requested Metal Hammer to provide the audio tapes to prove the authenticity of what Anselmo said . Abbott found the quote authentic and referred to him as the " master of lies " . 
 A book titled A Vulgar Display of Power : Courage and Carnage at the Alrosa Villa was penned by author Chris Armold . For 14 months , Armold interviewed people and researched the events leading up to December 8 , stating " It 's not a book about rock stars , but heroes , regular guys who made the ultimate sacrifice . " In his research , Armold found no evidence that the comments Anselmo made before Darrell 's death had influenced Gale 's actions . The book was released in 2007 . 
 = = Lyrical themes and style = = 
 Damageplan incorporated elements of heavy metal , post @-@ grunge , metalcore and death metal . Their sound has mainly been described as nu metal . 
 The lyrical process was a collaborative effort consisting of Vinnie , Darrell , and Lachman . Themes explored on the album included the brothers ' experiences , Darrell commented , " the crumbling of one empire and then starting over ... So there are a lot of lyrics about being reborn in a sense , about it being a new day , moving forward , letting go of the past and becoming something new . " This is exemplified in the songs " Reborn " , " Wake up " , and " Breathing New Life " . " Blunt Force Trauma " is about when someone or something comes up behind you when you least expect it , " it could be a situation in your life , it could be a person you know with a beer bottle " . 
 When writing music , Abbott and Darrell suggested guitar riffs and " grooves " , while Lachman added his input to modify the song 's structure . The band 's sound has been described by music critics to be similar to Pantera . Christine Klunk of PopMatters disliked the similarities and commented , " aside from a constant , driving rhythm , repetitive riffs , and unintelligible lyrics about ( I 'm assuming ) kicking ass — there 's nothing of interest to pay attention to " . The song " Breathing New Life " features 180 beats @-@ per @-@ minute bass drum pedaling , what Vik Bansal of MusicOMH described as " exploding into a blaze of riffage and a cool chorus " . Bansal was impressed with certain elements of the song such as the switch from downbeat singing to " a big chorus lodged in power chord heaven " , and the incorporated groove rhythms . However , he felt Darrell " borrows " Anthrax 's guitar solo from the song " Only " .

 = Jack Verge = 
 Arthur " Jack " Verge ( 12 February 1880 – 8 September 1915 ) was a rugby union player who represented Australia , New South Wales and Sydney University . Playing as a fullback , Verge won both his caps for Australia in 1904 against a touring team from the British Isles . Although he was relatively light for his position , he was repeatedly praised for his tackling and all @-@ round defensive work , and in attack , he was a fast and deceptive runner . His kicking , on the other hand , was inconsistent . 
 Verge went to The King 's School , Parramatta , and from 1900 to 1904 , studied medicine at St Paul 's College , University of Sydney . After graduating , he practised as a dermatologist . In 1907 , he won a fellowship at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh . In October 1914 , soon after the start of the First World War , he was commissioned captain in the Australian Army Medical Corps of the First Australian Imperial Force , and was attached as medical officer to the 6th Light Horse Regiment . He embarked for Alexandria , Egypt in December 1914 , and was deployed in May 1915 to Gallipoli , where he contracted dysentery . He was evacuated to Egypt , but died of his illness in September 1915 . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 Arthur " Jack " Verge was the second son of Austral and Matilda Verge of Hampden Hall , Kempsey , New South Wales . He attended the King 's School , Parramatta , which at the time produced many senior rugby players . From 1900 to 1904 , he studied medicine at St Paul 's College , University of Sydney , and after graduating , practised as a dermatologist . 
 He had two elder siblings , Mary Elizabeth and John . His younger brother , Cuthbert , also played rugby for Sydney University and New South Wales , and went on to become a doctor . 
 = = Rugby career = = 
 Jack Verge went to Sydney University in 1900 and for the first two years played fullback for the University second rugby team . In his second year , he began to be noticed by the rugby press , both for his defensive play and kicking skills . In the July 1901 match between University II and Balmain II , Verge scored two tries , and was then selected to play for the New South Wales ( NSW ) second team . 
 He also played cricket at University , initially for the second team , and he was considered to be as good a cricketer as he was at rugby . He was a slow @-@ pace bowler , and at one time , he was the most successful bowler at the University . He played in two matches against Melbourne University : in 1903 , he took two wickets for 22 runs in the first innings , and six wickets for 20 in the second ; in 1904 , he took four for 70 and three for 69 . 
 = = = Selection for University XV and NSW XV ( 1902 ) = = = 
 At the start of the 1902 rugby season in May , Verge was up for selection to the University first XV , either at fullback or threequarter , and also for NSW as fullback . He took the place at fullback on the University XV from A. J. McKenzie . By June 1902 , Verge was gaining recognition in the press . The Referee reported : " Verge , as full back , deserves a special word of praise for quickness and all @-@ round ability : he has steadily improved until he now may be compared with any man we have in the position . And he is likely to still further improve . " After a lacklustre performance by John Maund at fullback in the first inter @-@ state match between NSW and Queensland , Verge gained his first cap for NSW in the return match on 19 July 1902 at University Oval , Sydney . 
 Some 16 @,@ 000 spectators turned out to watch . From the start , both sides had good attacking opportunities . Early on , through the kicking of Verge and Blarney ( playing threequarter ) , NSW got to within 25 yards of the Queensland try line but the visitors managed to get the ball away . Shortly after , Queensland kicked the ball hard towards Verge , who was back at the NSW goal line , and the Queensland threequarter — and captain — Lonnie Spragg , chased fast after it but Verge kicked the ball away safely . NSW scored the first points with a goal from a mark by Stan Wickham and Queensland responded with a penalty goal before half time . The score at the break was 4 – 3 to NSW . Verge 's defensive work in the first half was noted by The Sunday Times of Sydney . Straight after the break , Wickham kicked a drop goal for NSW but Queensland scored a try moments later , which was converted and gave Queensland the lead 7 – 8 . Another penalty and a try for NSW put the home side ahead 13 – 8 for the victory . The game was considered one of the best between the two states . Verge , according to The Sunday Times , " made a highly creditable debut in representative football , in a match that required the full back to have his wits about him . " The Sydney Morning Herald noted that " Verge on several occasions saved splendidly , generally finding the line with useful punts and never losing his head . " Playing for University against South Sydney soon after , Verge gave a " brilliant exposition ... sure in catching , very quick and tricky on his feet , and excellent in finding the line , he could not have done better work . " 
 The premiership competition of 1902 was decided in the match between University and Western Suburbs on 27 August 1902 . After the match , Verge and other players from both teams departed for Brisbane with the NSW team , where neither he , nor several others of his teammates , had ever played . Western beat University and one commentator thought that Western 's fullback , Richard Simpson , had outplayed Verge . The first match against Queensland on 30 August was won by the home side , 16 – 11 . Verge 's performance was less well received than in the previous inter @-@ state match , with comments that his tackling was unreliable , although he kicked well . The following week , on 6 September , NSW played Queensland again and won a hard @-@ fought victory 8 – 13 , although a man short for the final 20 minutes . According to The Brisbane Courier , Verge " played a game at full back that could not have been improved on " . 
 Three players were considered for selection to play fullback for NSW in 1903 for the New Zealand tour of Australia : Maund , Verge and Hawthorne . Maund was selected and Verge continued to play for University . 
 = = = 1904 season = = = 
 Early in the 1904 season , according to " Rhabdos " writing in The Town and Country Journal , Verge was " showing fine form ... kicking and tackling splendidly , and [ was ] , in addition , very sure . " The selectors for NSW had a difficult choice at fullback between Maund , who had played in 1903 , Verge , and two or three others . The Sunday Times praised Verge 's handling , kicking and rush @-@ stopping . " Gulliver " writing for The Arrow preferred Verge 's quickness and positioning judgment ahead of Maund 's weight advantage but thought that both were playing a " first @-@ rate " game at fullback . It was Verge , in the end , who was selected to represent NSW on 11 June against Queensland . 
 A crowd of 22 @,@ 000 spectators gathered at the University Oval for the NSW v Queensland match on 11 June . It was not considered a good game , with the home side 's 11 – 6 victory coming through stronger defence . The fast pace of the Queensland backs almost resulted in a try early in the first half but the ball was knocked on over the line after the defenders were beaten . Instead it was NSW who got the first points through a converted try . Repeated attacks from Queensland failed to provide points and NSW scored another try for an 8 – 0 lead at the end of the first half . A further try came for NSW from " some sparkling work " , and Queensland gained two penalty goals , being prevented from scoring any tries by the defensive work of Verge , J. McMahon and Iggy O 'Donnell , the NSW skipper . In the final moments , Pat Walsh , the NSW forward , got close to scoring but lost the ball in the tackle . A scrum ensued and Queensland won the ball and kicked it away . Verge caught the ball running at full pace and went for the corner , but was pushed off the field just before he could score . Verge 's good game at fullback earned him selection for the return match on 15 June . 
 The match on 15 June was played at the Agricultural Ground in front of 12 @,@ 000 spectators . NSW soon put points on the scoreboard when O 'Donnell marked and Verge kicked a goal . Queensland responded soon after with an unconverted try , and then , after some fast play , scored a second try , this one converted to put the visitors ahead 4 – 8 . Verge then kicked a penalty goal to bring the difference to one point . The second half was a demonstration of good attacking play and strong defensive work on both sides . The only points scored were from a try for Queensland , giving them a 7 – 11 win . 
 = = = = The British Isles tour of Australia = = = = 
 The NSW backs , with the exception of Verge and Wickham , did not play very well in the two inter @-@ state matches , but the forwards , ahead of the match against the British Isles touring team , were seen to be good . The British team , in contrast , led by David Bedell @-@ Sivright , arrived in Australia with a reputation for the excellence of its back line . The tourists ' first game was against NSW on 18 June in front of 35 @,@ 000 spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground . The game had barely begun when the visitors were already attacking the tryline and NSW was forced to defend . Percy Bush , the British halfback , scored a drop goal within the first ten minutes , and soon after the British scored a try . They were proving to be very quick and aggressive , and the home side had to defend right on its tryline for much of the first half , which ended 0 – 12 . Another try came for the British within three minutes of the second half . NSW 's chance to score came when Britain was penalised inside its 25 but Wickham missed what should have been an easy goal . Instead the visitors scored another two converted tries and ended victors , 0 – 27 . It was said by The Sunday Times that it was the best rugby team to have visited Australia , whether from Britain or New Zealand . NSW played well but were " outclassed in every point of play " ; Verge , for his part , did " as well as could be expected " , although his attempt at a drop goal in the second half failed . 
 For the return match between NSW and the British Isles on 25 June , each side made four changes . In the opening period , the sides were evenly matched but eventually the British scored a try in the corner , which was converted , and a second try soon after took them eight points clear . The visitors were up 13 – 0 at half time after another converted try : the home side had made numerous attacking attempts but had failed to cross the line . The second half started as the first had ended , with NSW dominating , but they failed to score ; instead , the British managed to counter @-@ attack to score another converted try . NSW then managed to score a try but Verge failed to convert . The tourists then scored another three tries , one of them converted . With Britain leading 3 – 29 in the closing minutes , NSW scored a second try ; this time Wickham missed the conversion . The final score was 6 – 29 . 
 After the first match between NSW and the tourists , the Metropolitan Union made its selection for the team to play the tourists on 29 June , Verge amongst them ; some of the other eligible NSW players were not picked . On the day , however , it was Maund , not Verge , who played at fullback . 
 Verge was selected to play fullback for Australia against the British team in the first of the three test matches , on 2 July 1904 at the Sydney Cricket Ground . With 35 @,@ 000 spectators , the first half was dominated by the home team . Britain was forced to defend , and prevented Australia from scoring . Britain gained the upper hand after halftime , scoring 17 points with no response from Australia . The Australians played the second half with a man short after Charlie White , the threequarter , broke a rib towards the end of the first half . The Sunday Times reported that it was a " very fast and excellent contest with Britishers very little superior . " Verge was active in preventing the British scoring , making a try @-@ saving tackle early in the first half , and numerous crucial defensive plays throughout the game . Although his tackling was commended , his kicking game received some criticism . 
 The second test match , on 23 July at the Exhibition Ground in Brisbane , started well for Australia . In the first quarter , a kick from Wickham towards the British corner was picked up by Pat <unk> , the New Zealand @-@ born winger playing for Britain , and he was tackled into touch by the Australian forward Alec Burdon . The ball then came to Verge , who kicked towards the British halfback Bush , and Burdon took it and ran over the tryline for the opening score , with no conversion . The British levelled the score at the start of the second half with an unconverted try by Bush , and then immediately after , he scored a drop goal to put the visitors 3 – 7 ahead . The British added a further ten points to their tally , and won the match 3 – 17 . Verge kicked well in this game , according to The Sunday Times . Verge was not selected to play in the third test , and returned to play for the University team . 
 = = = End of rugby career = = = 
 At the end of the 1904 season , after passing his final medical examinations , Verge left Sydney University and stopped playing rugby for the team . A. J. McKenzie , whom he had displaced in 1902 , took over at fullback , although he soon gave way to Verge 's brother , Cuthbert . The older Verge was granted a blue , and was elected a vice @-@ president of the club . However , he returned to the team for the tour of New Zealand in September 1906 . Both Verge and his brother were selected for the tour squad . 
 The first game was against Otago University on 10 September , which the home side won easily , 21 – 0 . Jack Verge was the only one of the team to play well , preventing the home side scoring through his tackling . For the return match on 15 September , the younger Verge was brought in at five @-@ eighth , which helped strengthen the team . No points were scored in the first half , although the visitors came close to getting a try but were held up on the line . In the second half , Otago scored six points to Sydney 's three , and again came away the winners . Verge missed scoring from a penalty kick , which hit the crossbar . 
 Jack Verge departed for England aboard the RMS Mongolia on 25 May 1907 , to spend three years in the UK and Europe undertaking further studies in medicine , while also playing rugby . He was awarded a Fellowship at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh , and played rugby for Edinburgh University in 1908 . Verge 's brother , meanwhile , continued to play for University and also played fullback for Metropolitan against the Anglo @-@ Welsh touring team in Sydney on 15 August 1908 , which the tourists won 13 – 16 with a try in the final moments , and against the Ponsonby team on tour from New Zealand in August 1909 . On his return from Europe , Verge practised as a doctor in Macquarie Street before joining the army , and did not play competitive rugby again .

 On 2 October 1914 , shortly after the outbreak of the First World War , Verge enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force as a captain in the Australian Army Medical Corps . He was subsequently attached to the 6th Light Horse Regiment as its medical officer . After completing rudimentary training in Sydney , his regiment embarked on HMAT A29 Suevic on 21 December , reaching Egypt on 1 February 1915 . When the light horse regiments were sent to Gallipoli as reinforcements following the initial landing , Verge was attached to the 1st Australian Division . The reinforcements landed on 20 May , just after the failed Turkish attack on Anzac Cove . The 6th Light Horse Regiment was tasked with securing the right hand flank of the Allied lodgement , and during the months that followed undertook mainly defensive duties around the beachhead . The conditions on the peninsula were very harsh , and sanitation was poor . Several months after landing , Verge contracted dysentery and was evacuated to No. 17 British General Hospital in Alexandria , Egypt . He died on 8 September 1915 , and was buried at the <unk> War Memorial Cemetery ( Row Q , Grave No. 523 ) in Alexandria . 
 = Battle of the Baggage = 
 The Battle of the Baggage was fought between the forces of the Umayyad Caliphate and the Turkic Turgesh tribes in September / October 737 . The Umayyads under the governor of Khurasan , Asad ibn Abdallah al @-@ Qasri , had invaded the principality of Khuttal in Transoxiana , and the local ruler called upon the Turgesh for aid . The Umayyad army retreated in haste before the Turgesh arrived , managing to cross the Oxus river just in time , while their rearguard engaged the pursuing Turgesh . The Turgesh crossed immediately after , and attacked the exposed Muslim baggage train , which had been sent ahead , and captured it . The main Umayyad army came to the rescue of the baggage train 's escort , which suffered heavy casualties . The failure of the Umayyad campaign meant the complete collapse of the Arab control in the Upper Oxus valley , and opened Khurasan itself to the Turgesh . 
 = = Background = = 
 The region of Transoxiana ( Arabic : Ma wara ' al @-@ nahr ) had been conquered by the Arab Muslims under Qutayba ibn Muslim in 705 – 715 , following the Muslim conquest of Persia and of Khurasan in the mid @-@ 7th century . The loyalty of Transoxiana 's native Iranian and Turkic populations to the Umayyad Caliphate remained questionable , however , and in 719 the various Transoxianian princes sent a petition to the Chinese court and their Turgesh vassals for military aid against the Caliphate 's governors . In response , from 720 on the Turgesh launched a series of attacks against the Muslims in Transoxiana , coupled with uprisings among the native Sogdians . The Umayyad governors initially managed to suppress the unrest , but control over the Ferghana Valley was lost and in 724 the Arabs suffered a major disaster ( the " Day of Thirst " ) while trying to recapture it . Half @-@ hearted efforts by the Umayyad government to placate the local population and win their support were soon reversed , and heavy @-@ handed Arab actions further alienated the local elites . Consequently , in 728 a large @-@ scale <unk> uprising broke out with Turgesh aid , which led to the Caliphate losing most of Transoxiana except for the region around Samarkand . 
 The Muslims suffered another major defeat in the Battle of the Defile in 731 , in which they lost some 20 @,@ 000 – 30 @,@ 000 men , crippling the native Khurasani Arab army and necessitating the transfer of new troops from Iraq . In the years after the Defile , Samarkand too was lost and the Sogdians under Ghurak regained their independence , while Muslim military activity north of the Oxus River was severely curtailed : what little campaigning is mentioned in the contemporary sources before 735 concerns operations to maintain the allegiance of the principalities of Tokharistan in the upper Oxus valley . In addition , the Umayyad authorities were preoccupied by the rebellion of al @-@ Harith ibn Surayj , which broke out in early 734 , spread quickly and gathered the support of a large portion of the indigenous Iranian population . At one point , the rebel army even threatened the provincial capital , Marw . The arrival of the experienced Asad ibn Abdallah al @-@ Qasri , who had already served as governor of Khurasan in 725 – 727 , and who brought with him twenty thousand veteran and loyal Syrian troops , managed to reverse the tide and suppress Harith 's revolt , although the rebel leader himself managed to escape to Badakhshan . During the year 736 , Asad devoted himself to administrative matters in his province , the most important of which was the rebuilding of Balkh , to which he transferred his seat . In the meantime , Asad sent Junayd al @-@ Kirmani against the remnants of Harith 's followers , whom Junayd succeeded in evicting from their strongholds in Upper Tokharistan and Badakhshan . 
 = = Battle = = 
 In 737 , Asad launched a campaign into the principality of Khuttal , whose rulers had supported the Turgesh and Harith 's rebellion . Asad was initially successful , but the Khuttalan regent , Ibn al @-@ Sa 'iji , called upon the Turgesh for aid . While the Muslim army was scattered pillaging , the Turgesh khagan Suluk brought his army , allegedly 50 @,@ 000 strong , from his capital <unk> into Khuttal within 17 days . Ibn al @-@ Sa 'iji , who tried to play both sides off against each other , informed Asad of the Turgesh expedition only shortly before its arrival . Asad had time enough to send ahead his heavy baggage train , laden with the plunder and captives from Khuttal , back south under the command of Ibrahim ibn Asim al- ' Uqayli , accompanied by the contingent from the allied principality of al @-@ Saghaniyan . Asad with the main Muslim army remained behind , but at the arrival of the Turgesh host , Asad 's troops broke into a headlong flight for the Oxus , which they managed to reach just ahead of the Turgesh . The crossing of the river was a confused affair , as Asad ordered each of his soldiers to carry across one of the sheep the army had brought with it as provisions . In the end , the sheep had to be abandoned as the pursuing Turgesh attacked the Arab rearguard , composed of the Azdi and Tamimi tribal contingents , on the north bank . As the rear guard was thrown back , Asad 's army hurried to cross the river in panic . 
 Once south of the river , Asad , believing himself to be safe from pursuit , ordered his men to set up camp and sent orders to Ibrahim to halt the baggage train and likewise set up camp . The Turgesh khaghan , after consulting the local rulers , followed the advice of the ruler of al @-@ <unk> and led his army to cross the river en masse . Faced with a full @-@ scale charge of the Turgesh and their allies ' cavalry , the Arabs withdrew to their camp . The Turgesh attacked the camp but were turned back after a fight in which , according to al @-@ Tabari , the Arabs ' servants put on pack @-@ saddle cloths as armour and used the tent @-@ poles to strike at the riders ' faces . During the night the Turgesh departed , and rode south to overtake the Arab baggage train . Ibrahim ibn Asim had dug a trench around his encampment and his troops managed to beat off the first attacks by the khaghan 's Sogdian allies . Then the khagan , after climbing a hill and scouring out the dispositions of the baggage escort , dispatched a portion of his men to attack the camp from behind , focusing on the allied Iranian troops from Saghaniyan , while the rest of the army attacked the Muslims from the front . The Turgesh attack almost annihilated the defenders : the greater part of the troops of Saghaniyan , along with their king , the <unk> Khudah , fell , and the Turgesh seized most of the baggage train . Only the timely arrival of Asad with the main Arab army saved the remnant of the baggage train escort from destruction . According to the account of al @-@ Tabari , the Turgesh launched another unsuccessful attack on Asad 's camp the following day , 1 October 737 , and then departed . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 While the Arab army returned to its base at Balkh , the Turgesh wintered in Tokharistan , where they were joined by Harith . The campaign had been a disaster for Asad and his now mainly Syrian army ; Muslim control north of the Oxus had collapsed entirely , and while the Arab governor had been able to escape complete destruction , he had suffered considerable casualties . The losses suffered by the Syrians under Asad 's command in the 737 campaign in Khuttal were of particularly grave importance in the long term , as the Syrian army was the main pillar of the Umayyad regime . Its numerical decline in Khurasan meant that the Khurasan @-@ born Arabs could no longer be completely controlled by force ; this opened the way for the appointment of a native Khurasani Arab governor , Nasr ibn Sayyar , to succeed Asad , and , eventually , for the outbreak of the Abbasid Revolution that toppled the Umayyad regime . 
 As the Arabs customarily did not campaign during winter , Asad demobilized his men . On Harith 's urging , on the other hand , the Turgesh khagan decided to launch a winter attack south of the Oxus , hoping to raise the local population in revolt against the Arabs . In this he was joined not only by Harith and his followers , but by the great majority of the native princes of Sogdiana and Tokharistan . Asad quickly mobilized his forces and managed to catch the khagan himself with a small part of his army and defeat them at Kharistan . Although both the khagan and Harith escaped capture , the Battle of Kharistan struck a blow to the khagan 's prestige , and Suluk 's murder by his rivals a short while afterwards saved the Muslims from worse . 
 Under Asad 's successor , Nasr ibn Sayyar , the Muslim armies recovered most of Transoxiana , and with the Battle of Talas in 751 and the turmoil of the An Shi Rebellion , which terminated Chinese influence in Central Asia , Muslim dominance in the region was secured .

 Augie March are an Australian indie / pop rock band . Formed in 1996 in Shepparton , Victoria , the band currently consists of vocalist and rhythm guitarist Glenn Richards , lead guitarist Adam Donovan , bassist <unk> Ammendola , drummer David Williams , and keyboardist Kiernan Box . Box replaced Rob Dawson , the band 's initial piano player , who died in 2001 . 
 Augie March 's rise to fame was slow ; their first two EPs failed to make an impact on the market , despite Waltz being nominated for two ARIA Awards . Their first album , Sunset Studies , was released in 2000 . Despite poor sales , it was critically acclaimed and received an ARIA Award nomination . Critics in both Australia and the United States also lauded its 2002 successor , Strange Bird , but it sold and charted poorly in both countries . Augie March 's third album , Moo , You Bloody Choir ( 2006 ) , received a much better reception in terms of sales ; its lead single " One Crowded Hour " attained critical acclaim and appeared on the ARIA Charts at number 29 , while the album was nominated for numerous ARIA Awards and won an Australian Music Prize . Having achieved mainstream success , the band toured Australia and the United States regularly through 2006 and 2007 . In 2008 they released their fourth album , Watch Me Disappear . It became their most commercially successful album , but received the least favourable critical reception . 
 Augie March 's distinctive musical style is directed by songwriter and vocalist Richards . His lyrics often draw critical acclaim for their poetic style . The band 's music is generally described as intricate , lush , and dense , acting as a backdrop for Richards ' complex and poetic vocals . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Formation and early EPs ( 1996 – 1999 ) = = = 
 Glenn Richards , Adam Donovan and David Williams grew up and attended school in Shepparton , Victoria . Richards began writing songs while studying English at university in 1996 . He invited Donovan and Williams , who had been studying music at the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE , to join him ; they in turn asked classmate <unk> Ammendola to join in . The band took their name from the 1954 novel The Adventures of Augie March by Saul Bellow , citing its poetic , complex prose as a reflection of Richards ' vocals . 
 Augie March 's first performance was in Brunswick at a friend 's nudist exhibition . After playing several other gigs , the band were signed by record label Rag Records ( a <unk> subsidiary distributed by BMG ) , at the time considered to be prestigious . Augie March 's first EP , Thanks for the Memes , was produced by Victor Van <unk> and released in early 1998 . Despite very positive reviews it received very little airplay . Williams later remarked that he was surprised the band had been able to find a producer considering the obscure music on the EP , which at the time the band had considered " hip and cool , and intellectual " . 
 Augie March followed up with their second EP , Waltz , in October 1999 . Produced by Richard Pleasance , the EP included " Asleep in Perfection " , which became the most requested song on ABC 's rage program . The song was nominated for " Breakthrough Artist - Single " , and Pleasance for " Producer of the Year " , at the 2000 ARIA Music Awards . The band began touring around Australia , getting as far as Perth , and their popularity increased through word of mouth . BMG offered Augie March a recording contract , which they accepted . 
 = = = Early albums ( 2000 – 2003 ) = = = 
 Augie March went into the studio in March 2000 to begin work on their first full @-@ length album . Rob Dawson , a long @-@ time friend of Richards , joined the band on keyboard and piano . The band worked in nine studios with six different engineers over the course of six months . In July 2000 , prior to the album 's completion , they released their first single , " Hole in Your Roof " . In October 2000 , Augie March released Sunset Studies . Album launches in Sydney and Melbourne were attempted , but were unsuccessful as both cities were very crowded with musicians at the time ; Donovan said " it seemed like every band in the country was doing a tour then and we couldn 't get any venues " . Thus , they played a small tour along Australia 's east coast . The album did not chart well ; it spent one week on the ARIA Albums Chart at number 35 . 
 Sunset Studies ' critical reception , however , was very positive ; Noel <unk> of The Courier @-@ Mail said that on the album , " songs of quiet reflection , starkly beautiful melodies and intimate poetry collide on the canvas without a thought to sales graphs or what radio program directors might think " , while Allmusic 's Jack Rabid told American readers " it 's worth the effort to track down [ the album ] , particularly for those who think there are no more musical craftsmen out there " . The album 's production earned it the 2001 ARIA Award for " Engineer of the Year " , as well as nominations for " Producer of the Year " , " Breakthrough Artist - Album " and " Best Cover Art " . Of the album 's six engineers , Paul McKercher , Chris Thompson , Richard Pleasance , and Chris Dickie were credited with the ARIA Award for best engineer . McKercher and Pleasance , as well as the band , were named producers . Of the singles released from the album , " There Is No Such Place " was the most popular , charting at number 47 on the Triple J Hottest 100 , 2001 . 
 Preparations for a follow @-@ up to Sunset Studies were thrown into disarray on 2 January 2001 when Dawson died in a car crash . The event had a significant impact on the band and especially on Richards as he wrote their next album . However , the resulting work was not mournful ; Richards described it as optimistic and humorous . To replace Dawson , Melbournian Kiernan Box joined the band as a keyboardist . The band produced Strange Bird independently ; Donovan said this worked to their advantage as they felt more comfortable in their own studio , and that as a result Strange Bird was a better album than Sunset Studies , though the band 's debut album was " probably received better by our fans " . In response to complaints concerning Richards ' Sunset Studies wordplay , Augie March included a lyrics booklet with Strange Bird . 
 Strange Bird was released by BMG as the band 's second studio album in October 2002 . It was also released by <unk> Records in the UK in that month . It was re @-@ released in the United States in September 2004 . Like its predecessor , Strange Bird failed to make an impact on the charts , spending one week on the ARIA Albums Chart at number 34 . Its first single , " The Vineyard " , spent one week on the ARIA Singles Chart at number 31 . Augie March began touring around Australia almost immediately following the album 's release . 
 The critical response to Strange Bird , unlike its brief chart history , was overwhelmingly positive . The enthusiastic response even caught the band by surprise ; Williams told Rip It Up " I could see a few holes in the album and I 'd say , ' how come no one else has picked this up ? ' " Reviewers , however , focused on the positives ; Guy Garvey of The Independent said " My favourite of the year is Augie March 's Strange Bird " , while David Fricke wrote in Rolling Stone of " luxuriant melees of chiming guitars , mountain @-@ stream voices and keyboard grandeur " . Donovan said the band found it hard to take the positive reviews too seriously ; " if we did our heads would explode or <unk> " , he told Beat . 
 = = = Mainstream breakthrough ( 2004 – 2009 ) = = = 
 Augie March returned to the studio in 2004 to record a follow @-@ up to Strange Bird . The band worked with two producers , Paul McKercher and Eric Drew Feldman , and recorded in Melbourne , San Francisco , and their own studio in Nagambie , Victoria . Donovan said it was more suited to the band 's style ; as they co @-@ produced on all their albums , they took a great deal of interest in production . He said it also enabled them to work at their own pace , hence the four @-@ year gap between releases . They released a DVD , Drones & Vapid Ditties , containing live performances and music videos , in mid @-@ 2004 . The band 's upcoming album , according to Triple J , was inspired by the streets of Melbourne . Upon completion of the initial recording sessions of Moo , You Bloody Choir , there was a six @-@ month delay before release , as Augie March meticulously added finishing touches to it . In March 2006 , the album was finally released . 
 Moo , You Bloody Choir saw the band move from receiving only critical acclaim to achieving mainstream success as well . The album spent 21 weeks on the ARIA Albums Chart , peaking at number ten , while lead single " One Crowded Hour " reached number 29 in its 20 @-@ week ARIA Singles Chart stint . The album was certified platinum in Australia . Work by Augie March was nominated for six ARIA Awards in 2006 , including " One Crowded Hour " for " Single of the Year " . Despite the hype , the band did not win any further ARIAs . Augie March were still more successful underground than in the mainstream ; " One Crowded Hour " topped Triple J Hottest 100 , 2006 . The album 's popularity also saw it nominated for the 2006 J Award . A 2008 The Australian poll ranked " One Crowded Hour " the tenth best Australian song of the past 20 years . 
 Augie March 's musical abilities were recognised when they became the winner of the second annual Australian Music Prize in 2006 for " the most outstanding and creative Australian album released in the past year " . Ammendola told Drum Media winning the award was more significant than an ARIA Award , as " it 's an award that 's nominated on the grounds of music , and the art of it - not necessarily record sales " . The band used the A $ 25 @,@ 000 prize money to help fund a US tour . Richards later said that the band had no great expectations of breakthrough through in the US , and that if their second attempt was not successful , they would not try again . 
 In August 2007 , Moo , You Bloody Choir was released in the United States on the Jive Zomba record label . In the lead @-@ up to its release , Augie March toured regularly , playing in Los Angeles and New York in May . The shows continued following the album 's release , as Augie March were praised by US media . Pitchfork Media called it a " crime " that the band had not broken through in North America earlier , though Allmusic remarked that Strange Bird was a higher quality album than its follow @-@ up . 
 Despite the success of Moo , You Bloody Choir , much of Augie March 's post @-@ album touring involved supporting other bands . They played shows supporting The Aliens and Andrew Bird in the United States , before returning to Australia to open for Crowded House . Richards said the band 's status as an opening act , rather than headlining their own shows , was something they saw as a challenge — their intention was to win over fans who came to see the main act . However , he called the tour with The Aliens depressing ; the bands played very different types of music , and the attendance at shows was small . Augie March later earned a prime slot at the 2008 Big Day Out . 
 The success of Moo , You Bloody Choir saw Richards expected by record label Sony BMG to produce a quality follow @-@ up . He denied being under significant pressure , though the persistence of the label — " <unk> , have you got a single ? Do you have singles ? Please , do you have singles ? " — was noted . Much of the writing for Augie March 's fourth album took place while touring the United States , which Richards argued minimised the band 's opportunities to be creative . In 2008 , Augie March began recording Watch Me Disappear at Neil Finn 's Auckland studios ; they also recorded in Melbourne , Sydney , and Los Angeles . The band worked primarily in New Zealand to get away from the distraction of Melbourne , their hometown , thus allowing them to focus solely on recording . 
 Augie March worked with producer Joe Chiccarelli , who took a significant pay cut to work on the album after declaring an interest in Augie March 's music . According to Richards , the production of Watch Me Disappear was a process that contained " a fair bit of friction " . Ammendola was critical of Chiccarelli 's style of production and the short amount of time spent in the studio . The recording process also took its toll on the relationships in the band . Ammendola has said that " It tore us to bits . It was really really shit , we ’ re slowly patching up now . " 
 After placing the album 's title track on their website for free downloading , Augie March announced their first " proper headline tour of their homeland " , in which they would play music from the new album . The album was released in October 2008 . Watch Me Disappear 's reception was more mixed than that of its predecessors . Patrick Donovan of The Age said , " [ Y ] ou get the feeling that Watch Me Disappear will please more than just their mates and old fans " , but Bernard Zuel wrote in the The Sydney Morning Herald that it was " an album that no doubt will polarise fans " . Watch Me Disappear entered the ARIA Albums Chart at number four . 
 Augie March played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 14 March 2009 for Sound Relief , a multi @-@ venue rock music concert in support of relief for the Victorian Bushfire Crisis . The event was held simultaneously with a concert at the Sydney Cricket Ground . All the proceeds from the Melbourne concert went to the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire relief . Appearing with Augie March in Melbourne were , Bliss N Eso with Paris Wells , Gabriella Cilmi , Hunters & Collectors , Kasey Chambers & Shane Nicholson with Troy Cassar @-@ Daley , Jack Johnson , Jet , Kings Of Leon , Liam Finn , Midnight Oil , Paul Kelly , Split Enz and Wolfmother . 
 In July 2009 , " One Crowded Hour " was voted number 59 by the Australian public in Triple J Hottest 100 of all time . That same month , the band headed out on what was dubbed the " Watch Me Set My Strange Sun You Bloody Choir " tour which saw them play every capital city and many regional areas , giving each of their four albums an equal showing . 
 Beginning in December 2009 , the band began a multi @-@ year hiatus . Glenn Richards released <unk> , his first solo album , in 2010 . 
 = = = Reformation after hiatus ( 2014 – present ) = = = 
 After five years on hiatus and their apparently permanent disbanding , on 16 June 2014 Augie March announced — via their official Facebook page — that they are off hiatus . A week later the band posted that they have been working on a full @-@ length album for the last two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years . The band 's new album , Havens Dumb , was released on 3 October 2014 . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 While Augie March generally fall into an indie / pop rock genre , their ability to mix other genres into their style at times makes classifying their musical style difficult . A common thread that runs through the band 's sound is Richards ' literate and often verbose lyrics , which have set the band apart from much of the rest of the Australian music scene . Even early on in their career , Richards ' unique style attracted attention and he has drawn critical acclaim for his poetic style , with one reviewer describing him as " unique " , " refreshing " , and " intellectual " . Allmusic 's Jack Rabid said Richards " exhibits a honey voice " on Sunset Studies , but Grok pointed out that the album was rendered too complex or intricate for many . 
 Richards ' passion for poetry and literary studies again stood out on Strange Bird . John D. Luerssen of Rolling Stone said " poetry aficionado Richards puts his own literary stamp " on the album , and James Christopher Monger of Allmusic said the album contained " pastoral beauty , labyrinthine arrangements , and breathtaking prose " . Pitchfork Media 's Joe Tangari described the album as " so stuffed with ideas and instruments that it 's wont to rupture from time to time " . This was both a positive and negative criticism ; Tangari complained that at times " there is a surplus of sound " , but also said that the combination of the first two tracks — " The Vineyard " ( " slow beauty " ) and " This Train Will Be Taking No Passengers " ( " a wailing rockabilly psych raver " ) — was an excellent set @-@ up . Derek Miller of Stylus Magazine called the opening trio — the third song being the " simple acoustic guitar and arcing piano " of " Little Wonder " — bewildering , and that the album remained consistently as such throughout . PopMatters ' Zeth Lundy described Richards ' wordplay as frenzied , and said the " refined , worldly wit " on Strange Bird was striking . 
 Where Strange Bird was brimming with musical content , on Moo , You Bloody Choir Augie March were more simplified , while still maintaining some of the critically acclaimed aspects of their music . Ammendola considered their third album , led by " One Crowded Hour " , to be significantly different from their previous releases . Chad Grischow of IGN wrote of " lush , mesmerizing music meld with gorgeous melodies brought to life by Richards ' rich vocals that wrap themselves around each instrument " . In The Sydney Morning Herald , Bernard Zuel argued the album was more subdued ; " the tempos and the arrangements are a little quieter and simpler " . Richards ' lyrics , however , still drew praise ; " he writes with a 19th @-@ century novelist 's ear and a Dylanesque tongue " . Miller of Stylus also touched on the fact that " Moo is as direct a shot as you 'll ever get at Augie March " , but that it was nonetheless a " refining and continuation " of the band 's work thus far . Shirley Halperin , writing for Entertainment Weekly , said the album featured " smooth , emotive vocals mingle with soaring melodies that 'd make Paul McCartney proud " . Dan Raper of PopMatters said the lyrics to " One Crowded Hour " were poetic , citing the lines " Well put me in a cage full of lions / I 'll learn to speak lion / In fact I know the language well " , as well as the " full and glorious " chorus ; 
 And for one crowded hour , you were the only one in the room 
 And I sailed around all those bumps in the night to your beacon in the gloom 
 I thought I had found my golden September in the middle of that purple June 
 But one crowded hour would lead to my wreck and ruin 
 Watch Me Disappear was Augie March 's most mainstream pop work to date , described as a further distillation of the band 's earlier , even more complex , music . Richards considered it to be more streamlined than their early work , despite their attempts to maintain a sense of spontaneity . Zuel also noted a removal of much of the backing instrumentation which had acted as " clutter " around Richards ' vocals on earlier work . Scott Podmore wrote in the Herald Sun that the album did not have a standout song or an instant appeal but that it was " a slow burner that takes time to get to know you , but once it does , it 's a friend for good " . Triple J reviewer Jenny <unk> argued that multiple songs from the album could take the place of " One Crowded Hour " as " likely to become wailed for and misquoted at festivals " . She noted a " commercial potential " for the album , despite its more disconcerting and confrontational content . 
 = = Songwriting = = 
 Songwriting for Augie March is primarily initiated by Richards ; he delivers demos to the rest of the band members who then collaborate with him to develop the music . Kathy McCabe of The Daily Telegraph suggests " almost every songwriter in Australia has name @-@ checked [ Richards ] as one of the finest <unk> of his generation " and that " Richards is a storyteller who is spoken of in reverential terms by peers " . Richards simply states that he enjoys " dabbling with words " , and that people often appreciate him doing so . Despite this , Richards rejects the " literary " reputation he believes the band have gained . At the 2006 ARIA Awards , Midnight Oil 's Rob Hirst called for more political songs ; Richards told Simon Collins of The West Australian he saw great risk in writing political music , and would rather write music that rung true , so that " I can sing the song a thousand times after it 's been written " . Richards asserts he preferred to draw on everyday experiences than on literary influences . He also says that some of the music he writes is intentionally confusing . 
 The band , and especially Richards , are noted for their perfectionism . In a post @-@ Sunset Studies interview with Grok magazine in 2000 , Williams criticised the song " The Good Gardener ( On How He Fell ) " , to which the interviewer noted " the Augie March perfectionism ... a slavish , romantic , almost passionate pursuit " . This meme continued throughout Augie March 's career ; following the release of Moo , You Bloody Choir , Richards said he was not truly happy with anything he had produced so far . Ammendola agreed , and added that the band considered Moo , You Bloody Choir the weakest of their first three albums , and Sunset Studies the best . Richards later stated that he considered Watch Me Disappear his best album yet . Andrew Murfett wrote in The Age that for Augie March , " creative tension , adverse circumstances and perfectionism seem to go hand in hand " . Whereas Augie March 's first two albums saw Richards maintain control over production , Moo , You Bloody Choir and Watch Me Disappear " became community projects " , and for that reason Richards declared he was not as much a fan of the latter works , though other band members have described the songs on Watch Me Disappear as the band 's best yet . 
 = = Live concerts = = 
 Augie March 's live performances have been highly criticised for supposedly failing to live up to the quality of their recorded work . Interruptions are common ; at a 2000 concert following the release of Sunset Studies , Richards rhetorically asked the audience " what 's an Augie gig without glitches ? " , and <unk> ' Jayson Argall described a 2001 performance as " absolutely captivating one moment , utterly frustrating the next " , pointing to numerous instances of Richards halting the show due to minor <unk> . Richards will sometimes refuse to play songs popular with fans ; in 2007 Williams told Beat Richards no longer played " Asleep in Perfection " as " Glenn cannot fathom to sing the words that he wrote back then ... he 's moved on from that place " . He is also reluctant to play " One Crowded Hour " , having " played that song in every possible format and so many times it 's just a ridiculous joke " . Richards once forgot the song 's lyrics during a live performance at Federation Square . 
 A 2002 live review quoted an overwhelmed Richards as telling his audience " I don 't have anything to say tonight , there 's too many of you " . Another 2002 live review , however , stated that " the band seemed both at ease and happy to be back " when playing one of their first post @-@ Strange Bird <unk> dB magazine 's Steven Hocking , in a review of the band 's 2004 Drones & Vapid Ditties live DVD , said the band are " either unable or unwilling to engage the large audience " , and that they were " just not very visually engaging " live , when compared to the sound of their albums . Performances post @-@ Moo , You Bloody Choir have earned more positive remarks , however , as Richards has focused on improving his stage presence . David Fricke of Rolling Stone lauded an Augie March concert he saw in New York , which assisted the band in making inroads in the United States .

 " The Robbery " is the third episode of the first season of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld . 
 It aired as the third episode of the season on June 7 , 1990 . It was written by Matt Goldman , therefore making this the first Seinfeld episode not written by the show 's creators : Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David . 
 In the episode , Jerry leaves Elaine in charge of his apartment while he goes on tour . When he returns , he finds the apartment has been robbed after Kramer left the front door open . While Kramer promises to find the robbers , George offers him the chance to move into a much better apartment — a move he accepts , allowing Elaine to move in Jerry 's apartment and away from her annoying roommate Tina . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Jerry goes away to perform some stand @-@ up in Minneapolis , leaving Elaine to look after his apartment . Elaine is having trouble with an annoying roommate , Tina , who is a " Waitress / Actress " hoping to get a part , and asks George if he can find her some new accommodation . She then tries to persuade Jerry to give her his current apartment , with George offering Jerry a new apartment on West 83rd Street by Central Park which he claims is great , but Jerry turns the offer down . When Jerry returns he finds the apartment has been burglarized because Kramer left the front door open by mistake . As a way of making up , Kramer promises to find the items that were stolen from Jerry . 
 After the robbery , Elaine still asks Jerry to give her the apartment . Jerry decides to have a look around the new apartment first . The apartment is great and Jerry takes it , allowing Elaine to move into the old apartment . Jerry is about to sign the lease to the apartment , but George tells him that if he has having second thoughts , he should not take it . This results in him thinking that George may want the new apartment for himself . The two have an argument resulting in neither of them wanting to move . They gamble for the apartment and Jerry wins . Meanwhile , Kramer claims that he thinks he knows where Jerry 's stolen objects are , and suspects an Englishman along the hallway who denies having any " stuff " on him . 
 Later in Monk 's Cafe , Jerry goes back on the deal and decides not to take the place because George wants it . The two continue to argue about who should own it , and decided that neither of them should take it . A waitress , Carolyn , played by Anita Wise , overhears them and George offers the place to her , which she accepts . The waitress invites them and Elaine to her housewarming , but it is clear that Jerry , George and Elaine are not enjoying themselves . They overhear two people having a conversation about someone else moving out of their apartment , to which all three ask what the apartment 's rent is . 
 = = Production = = 
 " The Robbery " was written by Matt Goldman , a <unk> , therefore making this episode the first not to be written by Seinfeld or David and the only one not written by Seinfeld and David for the season , and directed by Tom Cherones , during the course of the first production season . The idea for the episode was inspired by Seinfeld 's own experiences of his apartment being robbed when he was a student , although rather than the door being unlocked as it was in the episode , the burglars broke through the walls . Co @-@ creator of the series Larry David was given a $ 20 @,@ 000 bonus by Castle Rock and was promoted to executive producer for his work on the episode . During the shooting of the episode , an earthquake struck the set , but no one was hurt . 
 The episode is the first to mention the character of Tina , Elaine 's actress roommate , although she does not appear in this episode . It is also the first episode to feature Kramer making a sliding entrance into Jerry 's apartment , which became a trademark in all the later episodes . Carolyn the waitress , played by Anita Wise , and her husband Larry , are named after Seinfeld 's own sister and brother @-@ in @-@ law . 
 In the original draft of the script , the Englishman is called " <unk> . " In the same script , Elaine asks Jerry what happened between Kramer and the Englishman . Jerry replies , " Kramer stayed there three hours . They 're like best friends now . " 
 = = Reception = = 
 When " The Robbery " first aired on June 7 , 1990 , it received a Nielsen rating of 13 @.@ 6 / 24 . This means that the episode was watched by 13 @.@ 6 % of American households , and that 24 % of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it . 
 Reviews of the episode are mixed . Andy Patrizio from IGN.com wrote that " The Robbery " was the best episode of the first season of Seinfeld , saying that it showed " the dynamics that would come to define the show . " However , Colin Jacobson for DVD Movie Guide said , " It lacks the great banter and play that marks the best episodes , but it doesn 't come across as a total dud . It just seems a bit uninspired in the greater scheme of things . " 
 = Master System = 
 The Sega Master System ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : Sega Masutā Shisutemu ) is a third @-@ generation home video game console that was manufactured by Sega . It was originally released in 1985 as the Sega Mark III in Japan . After being redesigned prior to its North American launch , the console was renamed Master System and released in 1986 in North America , 1987 in Europe , and 1989 in Brazil . The redesigned Master System was also released in Japan in 1987 . Both the Mark III and the original Master System models could play with both cartridges ( or " Mega Cartridges " , as they were officially called ) and the credit card @-@ sized Sega Cards , which retailed at lower prices than cartridges but had lower storage capacity ; the Master System II and later models did not have the card slot . The Master System also featured accessories such as a light gun and 3D glasses which were designed to work with a range of specially coded games . 
 Succeeding the SG @-@ 1000 , the Master System was released as a direct competitor to the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) in the third generation of video game consoles . The Master System was constructed with hardware superior to that of the NES , but failed to overturn Nintendo 's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America . However , it attained significantly more success in Europe and Brazil . The hardware of the Master System also shared many similarities with Sega 's handheld game console , the Sega Game Gear . Compared to its competition from Nintendo , the Master System 's game library lacks a number of well @-@ received titles due to Nintendo 's licensing practices that restricted third @-@ party developers from creating games for any system other than the NES . Sales of the console have been estimated between 10 and 13 million units , not including recent Brazil sales , compared to 62 million NES units sold . Reception to the system given in retrospect gives credit to the system 's role in Sega 's development of the Sega Genesis , as well as for having a number of well @-@ received titles , particularly in PAL regions , but is generally critical of its smaller game library compared to the NES . As of 2015 , the Master System is the longest @-@ lived game console ( 30 years and continuing ) , due to its popularity in Brazil .

 In the early 1980s , Sega Enterprises , Inc . , then a subsidiary of the conglomerate Gulf and Western , was one of the largest arcade game manufacturers active in the United States , with company revenues of $ 214 million by mid @-@ 1982 . A downturn in the arcade business starting in 1982 negatively impacted the company , leading Gulf and Western to sell the North American manufacturing and licensing of its arcade games to Bally Manufacturing . The company retained its Japanese subsidiary , Sega Enterprises , Ltd . , as well as Sega 's North American research and development division . With its arcade business in decline , Gulf and Western executives turned to Sega Enterprises , Ltd . ' s president , Hayao Nakayama , for advice on how to proceed . Nakayama advocated that the company leverage its hardware expertise gained through years working in the arcade industry to move into the home console market in Japan , which was in its infancy at the time . Nakayama received permission to proceed with this project , leading to the release of Sega 's first home video game system , the SG @-@ 1000 . 
 The SG @-@ 1000 was first released in Japan on July 15 , 1983 , at a price of JP ¥ 15 @,@ 000 . It was launched on the same day that Nintendo released the Famicom in Japan . Shortly after the launch of the SG @-@ 1000 , Gulf and Western began to divest itself of its non @-@ core businesses after the death of company founder , Charles Bluhdorn , so Nakayama and former Sega CEO David Rosen arranged a management buyout of the Japanese subsidiary in 1984 with financial backing from CSK Corporation , a prominent Japanese software company . Nakayama was then installed as CEO of the new Sega Enterprises , Ltd . Following the buyout , Sega released another console , the SG @-@ 1000 II , for ¥ 15 @,@ 000 . It featured a few hardware tweaks from the original model , including detachable controllers . The SG @-@ 1000 II did not sell well , however , leading to Sega 's decision to continue work on the video game hardware used for the system . This resulted in the release of the Sega Mark III in Japan in 1985 . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Engineered by the same internal Sega team that had created the SG @-@ 1000 , the Mark III was a redesigned iteration of the previous console . The CPUs in the SG @-@ 1000 and SG @-@ 1000 II were Zilog <unk> running at 3 @.@ 58 MHz , while the Mark III , SC @-@ 3000 — a computer version of the SG @-@ 1000 — and Master System feature a Z80 running at 4 MHz . The Mark III and Master System also carried over the Sega Card slot used in the SG @-@ 1000 . According to Edge , lessons from the SG @-@ 1000 's lack of commercial success were used in the hardware redesign of the Mark III , and the console was designed to be more powerful than the Famicom . 
 For the console 's North America release , Sega restyled and rebranded the Mark III under the name " Master System " , similar to Nintendo 's own reworking of the Famicom into the Nintendo Entertainment System . The " Master System " name was one of several proposals Sega 's American employees considered , and was ultimately chosen by throwing darts against a whiteboard , although plans to release a cheaper console similarly referred to as the " Base System " also influenced the decision . Sega Enterprises Chairman Isao Okawa endorsed the name after being told it was a reference to the competitive nature of both the video game industry and martial arts , in which only one competitor can be the " Master " . The futuristic final design for the Master System was intended to appeal to Western tastes .

 The Sega Mark III was released in Japan in October 1985 at a price of ¥ 15 @,@ 000 . Despite featuring technically more powerful hardware than its chief competition , the Famicom , the Mark III did not prove to be successful at its launch . Difficulties arose from Nintendo 's licensing practices with third @-@ party developers at the time , whereby Nintendo required that titles for the Famicom not be published on other consoles . To overcome this , Sega developed its own titles and obtained the rights to port games from other developers , but they did not sell well . NEC later used the same strategy on some of Sega 's titles when developing games for the TurboGrafx @-@ 16 . In preparation for the launch , Mark Cerny has stated that " pressure was very , very high " , with a typical game being allotted only three months of development time . 
 After being restyled the " Master System " , the console was released in North America in 1986 at a price of US $ 200 ( equivalent to $ 432 in 2015 ) , including a multicart of the games Hang @-@ On and Safari Hunt . It and Nintendo , which was similarly exporting the Famicom to the US as the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) , planned to spend $ 15 million in fall and winter 1986 to market their consoles ; Sega hoped to sell 400 @,@ 000 to 750 @,@ 000 consoles in 1986 . By the end of 1986 , the Master System had sold 125 @,@ 000 consoles , more than the Atari 7800 's 100 @,@ 000 but less than Nintendo 's 1 @.@ 1 million . As in Japan , the Master System in North America had a limited game library that was not as well received as the NES . Against Nintendo 's licensing practices , Sega only had two third @-@ party American developers , Activision and Parker Brothers . By 1988 , Nintendo commanded 83 percent of the North American video game market share . Sega claimed that " our system is the first one where the graphics on the box are actually matched by the graphics of the game " , and marketing for the Master System was targeted at bringing home the arcade experience , but its marketing department was run by only two men , giving Sega a disadvantage in advertising . 
 The console was re @-@ released as the Master System in Japan in October 1987 for ¥ 16 @,@ 800 . However , similar to the Mark III , this launch was not successful . The console in neither of its forms posed a serious challenge to Nintendo in Japan . 
 The European launch of the Master System occurred in 1987 . It was distributed by Mastertronic in the United Kingdom , Master Games in France , and Bertelsmann in Germany . Mastertronic advertised the Master System as " an arcade in the home " and launched the system at £ 99 ( equivalent to £ 251 in 2015 ) . Advance orders from retailers were high , but Sega proved unable to deliver inventory until Boxing Day on December 26 , causing many retailers to cancel their orders . As a result , Master Games and Mastertronic both entered financial crises and Bertelsmann vowed never to work with Sega again . Mastertronic had already sold a minority interest to Richard Branson and the Virgin group to enter the console business and now sold the remainder of the company to avoid bankruptcy . The newly rebranded Virgin Mastertronic then took over all European distribution in 1988 . Virgin Mastertronic consequently focused marketing the Master System on ports of Sega 's arcade games and positioning it as a superior alternative to the Commodore 64 and the ZX Spectrum home computers in terms of video games . As a result of this marketing and of Nintendo 's less effective approaches in Europe , the Master System began to attract European @-@ based developers . The Master System held a significant part of the video game console market in Europe through the release of Sega 's succeeding console , the Mega Drive . Brazil was also a successful market for the Master System , where the console was released in 1989 and distributed by Tectoy . 
 = = = Transition to Genesis and decline = = = 
 Sega released the Mega Drive , a 16 @-@ bit video game console , in Japan on October 29 , 1988 . The final commercial release for the Mark III and Master System in Japan was Bomber Raid in 1989 . During the same year , Sega was preparing to release the new Mega Drive , relabeled as the " Genesis " , in North America . Displeased with Tonka 's handling of the Master System , Sega reacquired the marketing and distribution rights to the Master System for the United States . In 1990 , Sega released the remodeled Master System II , designed to be a lower @-@ cost version of the console which also removed the Sega Card slot . Sega promoted the new model themselves , but the console still sold poorly in the region despite Tonka no longer being involved with the Master System 's marketing . In 1991 , Nintendo was found guilty of violating United States antitrust law and forced to abandon some of its licensing practices , but the Master System had already been in decline long before . By early 1992 , Master System production ceased in North America . By the time of its discontinuation , Master System had sold between 1 @.@ 5 million and 2 million units in the United States , finishing behind both Nintendo and Atari , which controlled 80 percent and 12 percent of the market , respectively . The last licensed release in North America was Sonic the Hedgehog in 1991 . 
 Contrary to its performance in Japan and North America , the Master System was eventually a success in Europe , where it outsold the NES by a considerable margin . As late as 1993 , the Master System 's active installed user base in Europe was 6 @.@ 25 million units , larger than that of the Mega Drive 's 5 @.@ 73 million base that year . Combined with the Mega Drive , Sega represented the majority of the console user base in Europe that year . The Master System 's largest markets in the region were France and the United Kingdom , which had active user bases of 1 @.@ 6 million and 1 @.@ 35 million , respectively , in 1993 . The remodeled Master System II also proved to be successful and helped Sega to sustain the Master System 's significant market share in Europe . More new releases would continue into the 1990s in Europe , including Sonic the Hedgehog 2 , Streets of Rage 2 , and Mercs . The Master System has also had continued success in Brazil , where new variations have continued to be released long after the console was discontinued elsewhere . These include the Master System Compact and the Master System 3 . By 2012 , the Master System had sold 5 million units in Brazil . In 2015 , it was reported that the Master System sells around 150 @,@ 000 units per year in Brazil , a level that holds its own against modern systems such as the PlayStation 4 . 
 = = = Game Gear = = = 
 Developed under the name " Project Mercury " and designed based on the Master System 's hardware , the Game Gear is a handheld game console . It was first released in Japan on October 6 , 1990 , in North America and Europe in 1991 , and in Australia in 1992 . Originally retailing at JP ¥ 19 @,@ 800 in Japan , US $ 149 @.@ 99 in North America , and GB £ 99 @.@ 99 in Europe , the Game Gear was designed to compete with the Game Boy , which Nintendo had released in 1989 . Despite the similarities the Game Gear shared with the Master System , the games of the latter were not directly playable on the handheld , and were only able to be played on the handheld by the use of an accessory called the Master System Converter . A large part of the Game Gear 's game library consists of Master System ports . Because of the landscape orientation of the Game Gear 's screen and the similarities in hardware between the handheld console and the Master System , it was easy for developers to port Master System games to the handheld . 
 = = Technical specifications = = 
 The main CPU of the Master System is a Zilog Z80 , an 8 @-@ bit processor running at 4 MHz . It has 8 kB of ROM , 8 kB of RAM and 16 kB of video RAM . Video is provided through an RF switch and displays at a resolution of 256 × 192 pixels and up to 32 colors at one time from a total palette of 64 colors . Physically , the Master System measures 365 by 170 by 70 millimetres ( 14 @.@ 4 in × 6 @.@ 7 in × 2 @.@ 8 in ) , while the Mark III measures 318 by 145 by 52 millimetres ( 12 @.@ 5 in × 5 @.@ 7 in × 2 @.@ 0 in ) . Both the Mark III and the Master System possess two slots for game input : one for Mega Cartridges and one for Sega Cards , along with an expansion slot and 2 controller ports . Sound is provided by the SN76489 PSG chip . The Japanese version also integrates the <unk> FM chip , which had been an optional feature on the Mark III . With few exceptions , Master System hardware is identical to the hardware in the Mark III . Titles for the console are playable on the Sega Genesis by use of an accessory known as the Power Base Converter , as well as on the Game Gear by use of the Master System Converter . 
 The Master System was designed with superior hardware when compared to the NES . It contains twice as much memory as its competitor from Nintendo . The CPU of the Master System runs at a faster clock rate than the processor in the NES , which is a Ricoh <unk> 6502 running at 1 @.@ 79 MHz , though a Z80 requires more cycles to execute an instruction than the 6502 . The NES is capable of displaying 25 colors at a time from a master palette of 54 , in contrast to the 32 colors at a time from a 64 color master palette on the Master System . 
 A number of accessories were created for the Mark III and Master System , which are cross @-@ compatible with one another . The controller for each console consists of a rectangular shape with a control pad and two buttons . Sega also introduced additional controllers , such as a bike handle controller and paddle controller , for the Mark III and a special sports controller for the Master System . A pair of 3D glasses known as <unk> 3 @-@ D were also created for games such as Space Harrier 3D , although Mark III users need an additional converter to use them . The Mark III also had an optional RF transmitter accessory , allowing wireless play that broadcast the game being played on a UHF television signal . A light gun peripheral known as the Light Phaser was also released . Its design was based on the weapon of the same name from the Japanese anime Zillion . 
 The Master System was produced in several variations . Released in 1990 , the Master System II removed a number of components in order to reduce the cost of the console , including the Sega Card slot , reset button , power light , expansion port , and activation music and logo upon turning on the system . Several licensed variations of the console also exist in Brazil , created by Tectoy . A variation known as the Master System 3 Compact was capable of functioning wirelessly with an RF transmitter , while Tectoy also sought to appeal to female gamers in Brazil with the Master System Girl , which was molded in bright pink plastic . A more recent version , released in 2006 in Brazil known as the Master System 3 Collection , contains 120 built @-@ in games . Another Master System , built as a handheld game console , was released under several brands including Coleco in 2006 . 
 = = Game library = = 
 Games for the Master System are in two formats : ROM cartridges are capable of holding up to 4 Mbit of game code , while Sega Cards can hold up to 256 kbit . Cards were cheaper to manufacture than the cartridges and included titles such as Spy vs. Spy and Super Tennis , but Sega Cards were eventually dropped due to their lack of memory . Some games manufactured for the system include Psycho Fox , <unk> , and Phantasy Star , which became a successful franchise for Sega and is considered one of the benchmark role @-@ playing games . The Master System also hosts games featuring Sega 's flagship character at the time , Alex Kidd , including Alex Kidd in Miracle World . Wonder Boy III : The Dragon 's Trap has garnered recognition as " a genuine milestone in video game design " due to its innovative blend of platforming gameplay with RPG elements . Built @-@ in titles are common in Master System hardware , including Snail Maze and Hang @-@ On , as well as Alex Kidd in Miracle World and Sonic the Hedgehog . Additional titles were also released in Brazil by Tectoy , including ports of Street Fighter II and Dynamite <unk> after the Master System was discontinued elsewhere . 
 A number of writers have criticized the game library for its lack of depth compared to the NES . Computer Gaming World compared new Sega titles to " drops of water in the desert " . Due to Nintendo 's licensing practices , few third @-@ party developers contributed games for the Master System . According to Damien McFerran , " Nintendo requested that developers keep their games ' NES exclusive ' , and given the unassailable position the console enjoyed , few had the will to defy this request . " In addition , according to game designer Mark Cerny , most of Sega 's early Master System titles were developed within a strict three @-@ month deadline , which negatively impacted game quality . Titles for the Master System , however , did take advantage of the advanced hardware of the console in comparison to the NES ; Alex Kidd in Miracle World , for example , showcases " blistering colors and more detailed sprites " than competing NES games . In addition , the Master System version of R @-@ Type has garnered retrospective praise for its quality , with its visuals considered comparable to those found in the TurboGrafx @-@ 16 port of the same title . 
 On the other hand , Retro Gamer praised the system 's PAL library , referring to it as a " superb library of interesting ports and excellent exclusives " and noting that it offered significantly greater depth than what was available in North America . They praised its " drip @-@ feed of quality titles " that continued to be released in Europe up until the mid @-@ 1990s . Such titles ranged from 8 @-@ bit entries of Mega Drive franchises such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Streets of Rage to dozens of exclusive PAL releases such as Lucky Dime Caper , Asterix , Ninja Gaiden , Master of Darkness and Power Strike II . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Sales of the Master System have been estimated between 10 million and 13 million units , not including recent Brazil sales , in contrast to the 62 million units sold by its chief competitor , the Famicom . Sega would later close the market share gap between itself and Nintendo in the next generation with the release of the Genesis , which sold 40 million consoles compared to the 49 million Super Nintendo Entertainment System consoles sold by Nintendo . The Master System saw much more continued success in Europe and Brazil than it did in Japan and North America . In 1989 , the Sega Master System was listed in the top 20 products of NPD Group 's Toy Retail Sales Tracking Service . However , reception in 1992 by Electronic Gaming Monthly indicated a souring interest in the console . Four reviewers scored the console 5 , 4 , 5 , and 5 out of a possible 10 points each in the magazine 's 1992 Buyer 's Guide , focusing on the better value of the Genesis and lack of quality titles for the Master System . By 1993 , reviewers scored the console 2 , 2 , 3 , and 3 out of 10 , noting its abandonment by Sega in North America and lack of new releases . According to Bill Pearse of Playthings , the NES gained an advantage over the Master System through the use of better software and stronger character identification . 
 Retrospective feedback of the console praises its support toward development of the Sega Genesis , but is generally critical of its smaller game library compared to the NES . Writing for AllGame , Dave <unk> notes that " it was doomed by the lack of third party software support and all but disappeared from the American market by 1992 . " On the other hand , Retro Gamer praised the system 's PAL library as a " superb library of interesting ports and excellent exclusives " , noting that it was significantly larger than its North American library . Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer recognizes its value to the future success of the Genesis , stating , " Without this criminally undervalued machine , Sega would not have enjoyed the considerable success it had with the Mega Drive . The Master System allowed Sega to experiment with arcade conversions , original IP and even create a mascot in the form of the lovable monkey @-@ boy Alex Kidd . " In 2009 , the Master System was named the 20th best video game console of all time by the video gaming website IGN , behind both of its main competitors , the Atari 7800 ( ranked 17th best ) and the Nintendo Entertainment System ( 1st ) . They praised it for having " plenty of great , original games " but criticized the Master System 's smaller games library compared to the NES , coupled with the sometimes uneven quality of the games that were released , as the console 's major issues , stating , " Months could go by between major releases and that made a dud on the Master System feel even more painful . " 
 The Master System and its software still retains some popularity . According to IGN , " Despite its narrow mass audience , the Master System had — and still has — a very loyal fan base . " In 2005 , Sega reached a deal with Chinese company AtGames to release Master System software in the form of emulation products in Taiwan , Hong Kong , and China . A number of Master System games are available for download on Nintendo 's Wii Virtual Console in North America , PAL territories and Japan . The first game released for this service was Fist of the North Star , on February 26 , 2008 , and later , Fantasy Zone , released on March 11 . Both were released in Japan . In North America , Wonder Boy was the first Master System game released for the service on March 31 , 2008 . Master System games have also been made available via the GameTap online service . 
 = Stuart Milner @-@ Barry = 
 Sir Philip Stuart Milner @-@ Barry KCVO CB OBE ( 20 September 1906 – 25 March 1995 ) was a British chess player , chess writer , World War II codebreaker and civil servant . He represented England in chess both before and after World War II . He worked at Bletchley Park during World War II , and was head of " Hut 6 " , a section responsible for deciphering messages which had been encrypted using the German Enigma machine . He was one of four leading codebreakers at Bletchley to petition the then @-@ Prime Minister Winston Churchill directly for more resources for their work . After the war he worked in the Treasury , and later administered the British honours system . In chess , he represented England in international tournaments , and lent his name to three opening variations . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Born in Hendon , London , Philip Stuart was the second of six children to a schoolteacher , Edward Leopold Milner @-@ Barry , who died in 1917 , and his wife , Edith Mary . A talented chess player , he won the first British Boys ' Championship in 1923 . He was a pupil at Cheltenham College , and won a scholarship to Trinity College , Cambridge , where he obtained firsts in classics and moral sciences . He represented Cambridge in chess . At Cambridge , he befriended another chess player , C.H.O 'D . ( Hugh ) Alexander , and composed a number of chess puzzles . Between 1929 and 1938 he was a city stockbroker , although he was unhappy with the work . From 1938 , he was the chess correspondent for The Times , succeeded in 1945 by Harry Golombek . 
 = = = Early chess contributions = = = 
 He made his debut in international @-@ class chess at the strong London 1932 tournament , which World Champion Alexander Alekhine won . Milner @-@ Barry 's best results in international competition were achieved in three straight years at the Margate tournaments from 1937 – 39 , and at Hastings 1938 . In all four events he finished just above the middle against strong fields , with performance ratings ( as calculated by Chessmetrics ) between <unk> and 2565 . This places him at a solid International Master standard , although he never received this title . He reached as high as No. 65 in the world between June and August 1941 , according to Chessmetrics , which ranks historical chess performances retrospectively , using modern algorithms . 
 He represented England in chess , and played in the international Chess Olympiads of 1937 and 1939 . The latter tournament , held in Buenos Aires , Argentina , coincided with Britain 's declaration of war on Germany in September 1939 . Milner @-@ Barry , with teammates who included Hugh Alexander ( at that time the British chess champion ) and Harry Golombek , abandoned the tournament unfinished , and returned to Britain . His full Olympiad results are listed later in the article . 
 = = Bletchley Park = = 
 Upon their return , all three soon joined the Government Code and Cypher School ( GC & CS ) at Bletchley Park . Milner @-@ Barry was recruited by mathematician Gordon Welchman , who had been his contemporary at Trinity College ; in turn Milner @-@ Barry recruited Hugh Alexander . Arriving in early 1940 , he joined Welchman 's " Hut 6 " section , whose task was to solve the Enigma cipher machine as used by the German Army and Air Force . 
 In 1993 , Milner @-@ Barry wrote that " to this day I could not claim that I fully understood how the machine worked , let alone what was involved in the problems of breaking and reading the Enigma cipher " . Nonetheless , with his knowledge of the German language , he made a study of the decrypts and found that they contained stereotyped patterns and forms of address that could be exploited as " cribs " – reliable guesses for the plain language message that matched a given piece of encrypted text . Finding reliable cribs was a critical task for Hut 6 , as Enigma was broken primarily with the aid of " bombes " , large electromechanical machines which automatically searched for parts of the correct settings . Bombes were reliant on a suitable crib in order to succeed . In autumn 1940 , Milner @-@ Barry was put in charge of the " Crib Room " . 
 He was billeted with Alexander , who was working in Hut 8 , the counterpart to Hut 6 working on German Naval Enigma . Their close friendship let them easily resolve the competing needs of their sections for the limited available bombe time . By October 1941 , he was deputy head of Hut 6 under Welchman . At this time , Bletchley Park was experiencing a shortage of clerical staff which was delaying the work on Enigma , and the management of GCCS appeared unable to obtain the resources needed . This affected both Hut 6 and Hut 8 , which was run by mathematician Alan Turing with Hugh Alexander as his deputy . Together , Welchman , Milner @-@ Barry , Turing and Alexander bypassed the chain of command and wrote a memorandum directly to the Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , outlining their difficulties . It fell to Milner @-@ Barry to deliver the message to 10 Downing Street in person , on 21 October 1941 . The next day , Churchill responded , " Action this day : Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done . " Within a month their needs were being met . 
 In autumn 1943 , Milner @-@ Barry took over as head of Hut 6 , which by that time had grown to over 450 staff , Welchman having been appointed the Assistant Director of Mechanisation at Bletchley Park . He remained in charge until the end of the war , presiding over a number of technical challenges presented by the introduction of extra security devices to the German Enigma , including the Enigma Uhr and a <unk> " reflector " rotor . His entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography notes that , " although he increasingly felt that Hut 6 was on the verge of losing the ability to decode Enigma , it held on until the end of the war , and this was due in no small part to his gifted leadership . " The official history of Hut 6 , written immediately after the end of World War II , comments on his early " most vital technical achievement " in finding cribs , and on his " administrative and diplomatic talents " in his later role as head of the section .

 Milner @-@ Barry joined the Treasury in 1945 with the grade of Principal . In 1947 , he married Thelma Tennant Wells , with whom he had a son and two daughters . The same year , he was promoted to Assistant Secretary , and Under @-@ secretary in 1954 . Apart from a stint in the Ministry of Health from 1958 – 60 , he remained with the Treasury until 1966 , when , aged 60 , he had reached the normal retirement age for the civil service . He was persuaded instead to carry on as a ceremonial officer administering the honours system . In this role , he supported the knighthoods of P. G. Wodehouse and Noël Coward . Milner @-@ Barry eventually retired in 1977 . He was appointed OBE in 1946 for his work in World War II , CB in 1962 , and KCVO in 1975 . 
 = = Later chess contributions = = 
 He had also continued to play chess , competing in the 1952 and 1956 Olympiads . This 1956 Olympiad trip to Moscow was risky , since Britain and the USSR , which had been allies during World War II , were by then locked into the Cold War , and Milner @-@ Barry 's wartime codebreaking knowledge would have been of great interest to the Soviets ; the very fact that Britain had broken German codes on a massive scale was kept secret until 1974 , when Frederick Winterbotham 's book The Ultra Secret was published . He placed second in the British Chess Championship at Hastings 1953 ( finishing behind only Daniel Yanofsky ) , with a score of 8 / 11 ; this would be his best result in British Championships . 
 He was president of the British Chess Federation between 1970 and 1973 , competed in the British Championship as late as 1978 , and was still competing in club and county @-@ level tournaments and matches into his 80s . His obituary in The Independent recalled his " savagely effective attacking style , honed to perfection through a series of ' serious friendly games ' against his old rival Hugh Alexander " . In 1972 , George Koltanowski wrote that , " his style was very pleasing to spectators because he was always looking for dangerous continuations and quite often he found them !

 In 1985 , Milner @-@ Barry fiercely defended the reputation of Gordon Welchman , who had come under posthumous criticism for publishing details about the wartime work of Hut 6 .

 He died on 25 March 1995 in Lewisham Hospital , London . A memorial service was held for him at Westminster Abbey on 15 June . 
 = Boshin War = 
 The Boshin War ( <unk> , Boshin Sensō , " War of the Year of the Yang Earth Dragon " ) , sometimes known as the Japanese Revolution , was a civil war in Japan , fought from 1868 to 1869 between forces of the ruling Tokugawa shogunate and those seeking to return political power to the Imperial Court . 
 The war found its origins in dissatisfaction among many nobles and young samurai with the shogunate 's handling of foreigners following the opening of Japan during the prior decade . Increasing Western influence in the economy led to a decline similar to other Asian countries at the time . An alliance of western samurai , particularly the domains of Chōshū , Satsuma and Tosa , and court officials , secured control of the imperial court and influenced the young Emperor Meiji . Tokugawa Yoshinobu , the sitting shogun , realizing the futility of his situation , abdicated political power to the emperor . Yoshinobu had hoped that by doing this , the Tokugawa house could be preserved and participate in the future government . 
 However , military movements by imperial forces , partisan violence in Edo , and an imperial decree promoted by Satsuma and Choshu abolishing the house of Tokugawa led Yoshinobu to launch a military campaign to seize the emperor 's court at Kyoto . The military tide rapidly turned in favor of the smaller but relatively modernized imperial faction , and after a series of battles culminating in the surrender of Edo , Yoshinobu personally surrendered . Those loyal to the Tokugawa retreated to northern Honshū and later to Hokkaidō , where they founded the Ezo republic . Defeat at the Battle of Hakodate broke this last holdout and left the imperial rule supreme throughout the whole of Japan , completing the military phase of the Meiji Restoration . 
 Around 120 @,@ 000 men were mobilised during the conflict , and of these about 3 @,@ 500 were killed . In the end , the victorious imperial faction abandoned its objective to expel foreigners from Japan and instead adopted a policy of continued modernization with an eye to eventual renegotiation of the Unequal Treaties with the Western powers . Due to the persistence of Saigō Takamori , a prominent leader of the imperial faction , the Tokugawa loyalists were shown clemency , and many former shogunate leaders and samurai were later given positions of responsibility under the new government . 
 When the Boshin War began , Japan was already modernizing , following the same course of advancement as that of the industrialized Western nations . But Japan protected its vulnerable economy by rejecting Western @-@ enforced free trade . And since those Western nations , especially Britain and France , were deeply involved in the country 's politics , the installation of Imperial power added more turbulence to the conflict . Over time , the war has been romanticized as a " bloodless revolution " , despite its large number of casualties . 
 = = Political background = = 
 = = = Early discontent against the Shogunate = = = 
 For the two centuries prior to 1854 , Japan had severely limited exchange with foreign nations , with the notable exceptions of Korea via Tsushima , Qing China via the <unk> , and the Dutch through the trading post of Dejima . In 1854 , Commodore Perry opened Japan to global commerce with the implied threat of force , thus initiating a period of rapid development in foreign trade and Westernization . In large part due to the humiliating terms of the Unequal Treaties , as agreements like those conveyed by Perry are called , the Shogunate soon faced internal hostility , which materialized into a radical movement , the <unk> <unk> ( literally " Revere the Emperor , expel the barbarians " ) . 
 The Emperor Kōmei agreed with such sentiments , and — breaking with centuries of imperial tradition — began to take an active role in matters of state : as opportunities arose , he fulminated against the treaties and attempted to interfere in the shogunal succession . His efforts culminated in March 1863 with his " Order to expel barbarians " . Although the Shogunate had no intention of enforcing it , the order nevertheless inspired attacks against the Shogunate itself and against foreigners in Japan : the most famous incident was that of the English trader Charles Lennox Richardson , for whose death the Tokugawa government had to pay an indemnity of one hundred thousand British pounds . Other attacks included the shelling of foreign shipping in Shimonoseki . 
 During 1864 , these actions were successfully countered by armed retaliations by foreign powers , such as the British Bombardment of Kagoshima and the multinational Bombardment of Shimonoseki . At the same time , the forces of Chōshū , together with rōnin , raised the <unk> rebellion trying to seize the city of Kyoto , where the Emperor 's court was held , but were repelled by Shogunate forces under the future Shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu . The Shogunate further ordered a punitive expedition against Chōshū , the First Chōshū expedition , and obtained Chōshū 's submission without actual fighting . At this point initial resistance among the leadership in Chōshū and the imperial court subsided , but over the next year the Tokugawa proved unable to reassert full control over the country as most daimyo began to ignore orders and questions from Edo .

 Despite the bombardment of Kagoshima , the Satsuma domain had become closer to the British and was pursuing the modernization of its army and navy with their support . The Scottish dealer Thomas Blake Glover sold quantities of warships and guns to the southern domains . American and British military experts , usually former officers , may have been directly involved in this military effort . The British ambassador Harry Smith Parkes supported the anti @-@ Shogunate forces in a drive to establish a legitimate , unified Imperial rule in Japan , and to counter French influence with the Shogunate . During that period , southern Japanese leaders such as Saigō Takamori of Satsuma , or Itō Hirobumi and Inoue Kaoru of Chōshū cultivated personal connections with British diplomats , notably Ernest Mason <unk> . 
 The Shogunate also was preparing for further conflict by modernizing its forces . In line with Parkes ' designs , the British , theretofore the Shogunate 's primary partner , proved reluctant to provide assistance . The Tokugawa thus came to rely mainly on French expertise , comforted by the military prestige of Napoleon III at that time , acquired through his successes in the Crimean War and the War of Italy . 
 The Shogunate took major steps towards the construction of a modern and powerful military : a navy with a core of eight steam warships had been built over several years and was already the strongest in Asia . In 1865 , Japan 's first modern naval arsenal was built in Yokosuka by the French engineer <unk> <unk> . In January 1867 , a French military mission arrived to reorganize the shogunal army and create the <unk> elite force , and an order was placed with the United States to buy the French @-@ built ironclad warship CSS Stonewall , a relic of the American Civil War . Due to the Western powers ' declared neutrality , the Americans refused to release the ship , but once neutrality was lifted , the imperial faction obtained the vessel and employed it in engagements in Hakodate under the name Kōtetsu ( " Ironclad " ) . 
 = = = Coups d 'état = = = 
 Following a coup within Chōshū which returned to power the extremist factions opposed to the Shogunate , the Shogunate announced its intention to lead a Second Chōshū expedition to punish the renegade domain . This in turn prompted Chōshū to form a secret alliance with Satsuma . In the summer of 1866 , the Shogunate was defeated by Chōshū , leading to a considerable loss of authority . In late 1866 , however , first Shogun Iemochi and then Emperor Kōmei died , respectively succeeded by Yoshinobu and Emperor Meiji . These events , in the words of historian Marius Jansen , " made a truce inevitable " . 
 On November 9 , 1867 , a secret order was created by Satsuma and Chōshū in the name of Emperor Meiji commanding the " slaughtering of the traitorous subject Yoshinobu " . Just prior to this however , and following a proposal from the daimyo of Tosa , Yoshinobu resigned his post and authorities to the emperor , agreeing to " be the instrument for carrying out " imperial orders . The Tokugawa Shogunate had ended . 
 While Yoshinobu 's resignation had created a nominal void at the highest level of government , his apparatus of state continued to exist . Moreover , the shogunal government , the Tokugawa family in particular , would remain a prominent force in the evolving political order and would retain many executive powers , a prospect hard @-@ liners from Satsuma and Chōshū found intolerable . Events came to a head on January 3 , 1868 when these elements seized the imperial palace in Kyoto , and the following day had the fifteen @-@ year @-@ old Emperor Meiji declare his own restoration to full power . Although the majority of the imperial consultative assembly was happy with the formal declaration of direct rule by the court and tended to support a continued collaboration with the Tokugawa ( under the concept of " just government " ( <unk> , <unk> ) ) , Saigō Takamori threatened the assembly into abolishing the title " shogun " and ordering the confiscation of Yoshinobu 's lands . 
 Although he initially agreed to these demands , on January 17 , 1868 , Yoshinobu declared that he would not be bound by the Restoration proclamation and called for its rescission . On January 24 , he decided to prepare an attack on Kyoto , occupied by Satsuma and Chōshū forces . This decision was prompted by his learning of a series of arsons in Edo , starting with the burning of the <unk> of Edo Castle , the main Tokugawa residence . This was blamed on Satsuma ronin , who on that day attacked a government office . The next day shogunate forces responded by attacking the Edo residence of the daimyo of Satsuma , where many opponents of the shogunate , under Takamori 's direction , had been hiding and creating trouble . The palace was burned down , and many opponents killed or later executed . 
 = = Opening conflicts = = 
 On 27 January 1868 , Shogunate forces attacked the forces of Chōshū and Satsuma , clashing near Toba and Fushimi , at the southern entrance of Kyoto . Some parts of the 15 @,@ 000 @-@ strong Shogunate forces had been trained by French military advisers , but the majority remained medieval samurai forces . Of those samurai forces there were the Shinsengumi . Meanwhile , the forces of Chōshū and Satsuma were outnumbered 3 : 1 but fully modernized with Armstrong howitzers , Minié rifles and a few Gatling guns . After an inconclusive start , on the second day , an Imperial banner was remitted to the defending troops , and a relative of the Emperor , <unk> Yoshiaki , was named nominal commander in chief , making the forces officially an imperial army ( <unk> , <unk> ) . Moreover , convinced by courtiers , several local daimyo , up to this point faithful to the Shogun , started to defect to the side of the imperial court . These included daimyo of <unk> on February 5 , and the daimyo of Tsu on February 6 , tilting the military balance in favour of the Imperial side . 
 On February 7 , Tokugawa Yoshinobu , apparently distressed by the imperial approval given to the actions of Satsuma and Chōshū , fled Osaka aboard the <unk> Maru , withdrawing to Edo . Demoralized by his flight and by the betrayal by <unk> and Tsu , Shogunate forces retreated , making the Toba @-@ Fushimi encounter an Imperial victory , although it is often considered the Shogunate forces should have won the encounter . Osaka Castle was soon invested on February 8 ( on March 1 , Western calendar ) , putting an end to the battle of Toba @-@ Fushimi . 
 At the same time , on 28 January 1868 , the naval Battle of Awa between the Shogunate and elements of the Satsuma Navy took place . This was Japan 's second engagement between two modern navies . The battle , although small in scale , ended in favour of the Shogunate . 
 On the diplomatic front , the ministers of foreign nations , gathered in the open harbor of Hyōgo ( present day Kobe ) in early February , issued a declaration according to which the Shogunate was still considered the only rightful government in Japan , giving hope to Tokugawa Yoshinobu that foreign nations ( especially France ) might consider an intervention in his favour . A few days later however an Imperial delegation visited the ministers declaring that the Shogunate was abolished , that harbours would be open in accordance with International treaties , and that foreigners would be protected . The ministers finally decided to recognize the new government . 
 The rise of anti @-@ foreign sentiment nonetheless led to several attacks on foreigners in the following months . Eleven French sailors from the corvette Dupleix were killed by samurai of Tosa in the Sakai incident on March 8 , 1868 . Fifteen days later , Sir Harry Parkes , the British ambassador , was attacked by a group of samurai in a street of Kyoto . 
 = = Surrender of Edo = = 
 Beginning in February , with the help of the French ambassador Léon Roches , a plan was formulated to stop the imperial court 's advance at Odawara , the last strategic entry point to Edo , but Yoshinobu decided against the plan . Shocked , Léon Roches resigned from his position . In early March , under the influence of the British minister Harry Parkes , foreign nations signed a strict neutrality agreement , according to which they could not intervene or provide military supplies to either side until the resolution of the conflict . 
 Saigō Takamori led the victorious imperial forces north and east through Japan , winning the Battle of <unk> @-@ <unk> . He eventually surrounded Edo in May 1868 , leading to its unconditional defeat after Katsu Kaishū , the Shogun 's Army Minister , negotiated the surrender . Some groups continued to resist after this surrender but were defeated in the Battle of Ueno on 4 July 1868 . 
 Meanwhile , the leader of the Shogun 's navy , Enomoto Takeaki , refused to surrender all his ships . He remitted just four ships , among them the <unk> , but he then escaped north with the remnants of the Shogun 's Navy ( eight steam warships : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> Maru , <unk> Maru , <unk> and <unk> ) , and 2 @,@ 000 members of the navy , in the hope of staging a counter @-@ attack together with the northern daimyo . He was accompanied by a handful of French military advisers , notably Jules Brunet , who had formally resigned from the French Army in order to accompany the rebels . 
 = = Resistance of the Northern Coalition = = 
 After Yoshinobu 's surrender , most of Japan accepted the emperor 's rule , but a core of domains in the North , supporting the Aizu clan , continued the resistance . In May several northern daimyo formed an Alliance to fight Imperial troops , the coalition of northern domains composed primarily of forces from the domains of Sendai , Yonezawa , Aizu , Shōnai and Nagaoka , with a total of 50 @,@ 000 troops . An Imperial Prince , <unk> Yoshihisa had fled north with partisans of the Tokugawa shogunate and was made the nominal head of the Northern Coalition , with the intention of naming him " Emperor <unk> " . 
 Enomoto 's fleet joined Sendai harbour on August 26 . Although the Northern Coalition was numerous , it was poorly equipped , and relied on traditional fighting methods . Modern armament was scarce , and last @-@ minute efforts were made to build cannons made of wood and reinforced with roping , firing stone projectiles . Such cannons , installed on defensive structures , could only fire four or five projectiles before bursting . On the other hand , the daimyo of Nagaoka managed to procure two of the three Gatling guns in Japan and 2 @,@ 000 modern French rifles from the German weapons dealer Henry Schnell . 
 In May 1868 , the daimyo of Nagaoka inflicted high losses on the Imperial troops in the Battle of <unk> , but his castle ultimately fell on May 19 . Imperial troops continued to progress north , defeating the Shinsengumi at the Battle of <unk> Pass , which opened the way for their attack on the castle of <unk> in the Battle of Aizu in October 1868 , thus making the position in Sendai untenable . 
 The coalition crumbled , and on October 12 , 1868 the fleet left Sendai for Hokkaidō , after having acquired two more ships ( Oe and <unk> , previously borrowed by Sendai from the Shogunate ) , and about 1 @,@ 000 more troops : remaining Shogunate troops under Ōtori Keisuke , Shinsengumi troops under Hijikata Toshizō , the guerilla corps ( <unk> ) under Hitomi <unk> , as well as several more French advisers ( <unk> , Garde , Marlin , <unk> ) . 
 On October 26 , Edo was renamed Tokyo , and the Meiji period officially started . Aizu was besieged starting that month , leading to the mass suicide of the <unk> ( White Tiger Corps ) young warriors . After a protracted month @-@ long battle , Aizu finally admitted defeat on November 6 . 
 = = Hokkaidō campaign = = 
 = = = Creation of the Ezo Republic = = = 
 Following defeat on Honshū , Enomoto Takeaki fled to Hokkaidō with the remnants of the navy and his handful of French advisers . Together they organized a government , with the objective of establishing an independent island nation dedicated to the development of Hokkaidō . They formally established the Republic of Ezo on the American model , Japan 's only ever republic , and Enomoto was elected as President , with a large majority . The republic tried to reach out to foreign legations present in Hakodate , such as the Americans , French , and Russians , but was not able to garner any international recognition or support . Enomoto offered to confer the territory to the Tokugawa Shogun under Imperial rule , but his proposal was declined by the Imperial Governing Council . 
 During the winter , they fortified their defenses around the southern peninsula of Hakodate , with the new fortress of <unk> at the center . The troops were organized under a Franco @-@ Japanese command , the commander @-@ in @-@ chief Ōtori Keisuke being seconded by the French captain Jules Brunet , and divided between four brigades . Each of these was commanded by a French non @-@ commissioned officer ( <unk> , Marlin , Cazeneuve , <unk> ) , and were themselves divided into eight half @-@ brigades , each under Japanese command . 
 = = = Final losses and surrender = = = 
 The Imperial navy reached the harbour of Miyako on March 20 , but anticipating the arrival of the imperial ships , the Ezo rebels organized a daring plan to seize the Kōtetsu . Led by Shinsengumi commander Hijikata Toshizō , three warships were dispatched for a surprise attack , in what is known as the Battle of Miyako Bay . The battle ended in failure for the Tokugawa side , owing to bad weather , engine trouble and the decisive use of a Gatling gun by Imperial troops against samurai boarding parties . 
 Imperial forces soon consolidated their hold on mainland Japan , and , in April 1869 , dispatched a fleet and an infantry force of 7 @,@ 000 to Ezo , starting the Battle of Hakodate . The Imperial forces progressed swiftly and won the naval engagement at Hakodate Bay , Japan 's first large @-@ scale naval battle between modern navies , as the fortress of <unk> was surrounded with 800 remaining men . Seeing the situation had become desperate , the French advisers escaped to a French ship stationed in Hakodate Bay — <unk> , under the command of Dupetit @-@ Thouars — from where they were shipped back to Yokohama and then France . The Japanese requested that the French advisers be given judgement in France ; however , due to popular support in France for their actions , the former French advisers in Japan were not punished for their actions . 
 Enomoto had resolved to fight to the end , and had sent his valuables to his adversary for safekeeping . These included the Naval Codes he had brought back from Holland , which he entrusted to the general of the Imperial troops , Kuroda Kiyotaka , but <unk> convinced him to surrender , telling him that deciding to live through defeat is the truly courageous way : " If it 's dying you want you can do it anytime . " Enomoto surrendered on June 27 , 1869 , accepting the Meiji Emperor 's rule , and the Ezo Republic ceased to exist . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Following victory , the new government proceeded with unifying the country under a single , legitimate and powerful rule by the imperial court . The emperor 's residence was effectively transferred from Kyoto to Edo at the end of 1868 , and the city renamed to Tokyo . The military and political power of the domains was progressively eliminated , and the domains themselves were soon transformed into prefectures , whose governors were appointed by the emperor . A major reform was the effective expropriation and abolition of the samurai class , allowing many samurai to change into administrative or entrepreneurial positions , but forcing many others into poverty . The southern domains of Satsuma , Chōshū and Tosa , having played a decisive role in the victory , occupied most of the key posts in government for several decades following the conflict , a situation sometimes called the " Meiji oligarchy " and formalized with the institution of the genrō . In 1869 , the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo was built in honour of the victims of the Boshin War . 
 Some leading partisans of the former Shogun were imprisoned , but narrowly escaped execution . This clemency derives from the insistence of Saigō Takamori and Iwakura Tomomi , although much weight was placed on the advice of Parkes , the British envoy . He had urged Saigō , in the words of Ernest <unk> , " that severity towards <unk> [ Yoshinobu ] or his supporters , especially in the way of personal punishment , would injure the reputation of the new government in the opinion of European Powers . " After two or three years of imprisonment , most of them were called to serve the new government , and several pursued brilliant careers . Enomoto Takeaki , for instance , would later serve as an envoy to Russia and China and as the education minister . 
 The Imperial side did not pursue its objective to expel foreign interests from Japan , but instead shifted to a more progressive policy aiming at the continued modernization of the country and the renegotiation of unequal treaties with foreign powers , later under the " rich country , strong army " ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) motto . The shift in stance towards the foreigners came during the early days of the civil war : on April 8 , 1868 , new signboards were erected in Kyoto ( and later throughout the country ) that specifically repudiated violence against foreigners . During the course of the conflict , Emperor Meiji personally received European envoys , first in Kyoto , then later in Osaka and Tokyo . Also unprecedented was Emperor Meiji 's reception of Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh , in Tokyo , " ' as his equal in point of blood . ' " 
 Although the early Meiji era witnessed a warming between the imperial court and foreign powers , relations with France temporarily soured due to the initial support by France for the Shogun . Soon however a second military mission was invited to Japan in 1874 , and a third one in 1884 . A high level of interaction resumed around 1886 , when France helped build the Imperial Japanese Navy 's first large @-@ scale modern fleet , under the direction of naval engineer Louis @-@ Émile Bertin . The modernization of the country had started during the last years of the Shogunate , and the Meiji government ultimately adopted the same policy . 
 Upon his coronation , Meiji issued his Charter Oath , calling for deliberative assemblies , promising increased opportunities for the common people , abolishing the " evil customs of the past " , and seeking knowledge throughout the world " to strengthen the foundations of imperial rule " . Prominent reforms of the Meiji government included the 1871 abolition of the domain system , by which the feudal domains and their hereditary rulers were replaced by prefectures with governors appointed by the emperor . Others included the introduction of compulsory schooling and the abolition of Confucian class distinctions . The reforms culminated in the 1889 issuance of the Meiji Constitution . However , despite the support given to the imperial court by samurai , many of the early Meiji reforms were seen as detrimental to their interests : the creation of a conscript army made of commoners , as well as the loss of hereditary prestige and stipends antagonized many former samurai . Tensions ran particularly high in the south , leading to the 1874 Saga Rebellion , and a rebellion in Chōshū in 1876 . Former samurai in Satsuma , led by Saigō Takamori , who had left government over foreign policy differences , started the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877 . Fighting for the maintenance of the samurai class and a more virtuous government , their slogan was " new government , high morality " ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) . It ended with a heroic but total defeat at the Battle of <unk> . 
 = = Later depictions = = 
 In modern summaries , the Meiji Restoration is often described as a " bloodless revolution " leading to the sudden modernization of Japan . The facts of the Boshin War , however , clearly show that the conflict was quite violent : about 120 @,@ 000 troops were mobilized altogether with roughly 3 @,@ 500 known casualties during open hostilities but much more during terrorist attacks . Later Japanese depictions of the war tended to be highly romanticized , showing the <unk> side fighting with traditional methods , against an already modernized Imperial side . Although traditional weapons and techniques were used , both sides employed some of the most modern armaments and fighting techniques of the period , including the ironclad warship , Gatling guns , and fighting techniques learned from Western military advisors . 
 Such Japanese depictions include numerous dramatizations , spanning many genres . Notably , Jirō Asada wrote a four @-@ volume novel of the account , Mibu <unk> @-@ den . A film adaptation of Asada 's work , directed by Yōjirō Takita , is known as When the Last Sword Is Drawn . A ten @-@ hour television jidaigeki based on the same novel starred Ken Watanabe . The 2001 <unk> film is another jidaigeki highlighting the resistance in Hokkaidō . Among Japanese anime , Bakumatsu <unk> <unk> in part dramatizes the Boshin War , while Rurouni Kenshin is set 10 years after . The Rurouni Kenshin OVA Trust & Betrayal is set during the Boshin War and depicts several events of the war ( such as the raid on the daimyo of Satsuma 's residence and the failed boarding of the Kōtetsu at the Battle of Miyako Bay ) . 
 Western interpretations include the 2003 American film The Last Samurai directed by Edward Zwick , which combines into a single narrative historical situations belonging both to the Boshin War , the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion , and other similar uprisings of ex @-@ samurai during the early Meiji period . The elements of the movie pertaining to the early modernization of Japan 's military forces as well as the direct involvement of foreign ( mostly French ) forces relate to the Boshin War and the few years leading to it . However , the suicidal stand of traditionalist samurai forces led by Saigō Takamori against the modernized Imperial army relate to the much later Satsuma Rebellion . 
 The main campaign in the 2012 expansion to Creative Assembly 's game Total War : Shogun 2 : Fall of the Samurai depicts the Boshin War . Players can choose from various historical clans , such as the Imperial Satsuma or the Shogunate Aizu . 
 = = Weaponry of the Boshin War = = 
 The forces of Chōshū and Satsuma were fully modernized with Armstrong guns , Minié rifles and one Gatling gun . The Shogunate forces had been slightly lagging in term of equipment , although the French military mission to Japan ( 1867 – 1868 ) had recently trained a core elite force . The Shogun also relied on troops supplied by allied domains , which were not necessarily as advanced in terms of military equipment and methods , composing an army that had both modern and outdated elements . 
 = = = Individual guns = = = 
 Numerous types of more or less modern smoothbore guns and rifles were imported , from countries as varied as France , Germany , the Netherlands , Britain , or the United States , and coexisted with traditional types such as the Tanegashima matchlock . 
 Most Shogunate troops used <unk> ( Gewehr ) smoothbore guns , which had been imported in Japan since around 1840 , initially from the Netherlands by Takashima <unk> . These guns were rather ancient and had limited capabilities , with an effective lethal range of about 50 meters , and a firing rate of about 2 rounds per minute . The Daimyo of Nagaoka however , an ally of the Shogun , possessed two Gatling guns and several thousand modern rifles . The Shogunate is known to have placed an order for 30 @,@ 000 modern Dreyse needle guns in 1866 . Napoleon III provided Tokugawa Yoshinobu with 2 @,@ 000 state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art <unk> rifles , which he used to equip his personal guard . <unk> Tanegashima matchlock guns are also known to have been used by the Bakufu however . 
 Imperial troops mainly used Minié rifles , which were much more accurate , lethal , and had a much longer range than the smoothbore Gewehr guns , although , being also muzzle @-@ loading , they were similarly limited to two shots per minute . Improved breech @-@ loading mechanisms , such as the Snider , developing a rate of about ten shots a minute , are known to have been used by troops of the Tosa Domain against the Shogunate 's <unk> , at the Battle of Ueno in July 1868 . In the second half of the conflict , in the northeast theater , Tosa Province troops are known to have used American @-@ made Spencer repeating rifles . American @-@ made handguns were also popular , such as the 1863 Smith & Wesson Army No 2 , which was imported to Japan by the Scottish trader Thomas Blake Glover and used by the Satsuma forces .

 In the area of warships also , some of the most recent ironclads such as the Kōtetsu coexisted with older types of steamboats and even traditional sailboats . The Shogunate initially had a rather strong edge in warships , and it had the vision to order the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art French @-@ made <unk> , although the ship was blocked from delivery by foreign powers on ground of neutrality once the conflict had started , and was ultimately remitted to the Imperial faction shortly after the Battle of Toba – Fushimi .

 Uniforms were Western @-@ style for modernized troops ( usually dark , with variations in the shape of the helmet : tall conical for Satsuma , flat conical for Chōshū , rounded for the Shogunate ) . 
 Officers of the Shogunate often wore French and British uniforms . Traditional troops however retained their samurai clothes . 
 Some of the headgear for some of the Imperial troops was quite peculiar , involving the use of long , colored , " bear " hair . The " red bear " ( <unk> , <unk> ) wigs indicate officers from Tosa , the " white bear " ( <unk> , <unk> ) wigs officers from Chōshū , and the " black bear " ( <unk> , <unk> ) wigs officers from Satsuma . 
 = The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories = 
 The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories , published in October 2006 , is a collection of eight short stories by Susanna Clarke and illustrated by Charles Vess . The stories , which are sophisticated fairy tales , focus on the power of women and are set in the same alternate history as Clarke 's debut novel Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell ( 2004 ) , in which magic has returned to England . The stories are written in a pastiche of 18th- and 19th @-@ century styles and their tone is macabre as well as satirical . The volume was generally well received , though some critics compared it unfavorably to Jonathan Strange . 
 = = Contents and themes = = 
 The collection , presented as the work of several different writers , contains an introduction and eight fairy tales , seven of which had been previously anthologized . The volume 's focus on " female mastery of the dark arts " is reflected in the ladies of Grace Adieu 's magical abilities and the prominent role needlework plays in saving the Duke of Wellington and Mary , Queen of Scots . The collection is a " sly , frequently comical , feminist revision " of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell . In tone , the stories are similar to the clear yet impassive narrator 's voice of Jonathan Strange . 
 " Introduction " by Professor James Sutherland , Director of Sidhe Studies , University of Aberdeen . Written in the same postmodern style as Jonathan Strange , the " introduction " to the collection by fictional Professor Sutherland speculates on the " sources " for the stories . Clarke begins by describing his " two very modest aims " : " The first is to throw some sort of light on the development of magic in the British Isles at different periods ; the second is to introduce the reader to some of the ways in which Faerie can impinge upon our own quotidian world , in other words to create a sort of primer to Faerie and fairies . " 
 " The Ladies of Grace Adieu " was Clarke 's first published story . While working on Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell , she enrolled in a writing course co @-@ taught by Colin Greenland and Geoff Ryman , which required each student to submit a completed short story before the course began . Clarke culled " The Ladies of Grace Adieu " from her incipient novel . Greenland was so impressed with the story that , without Clarke 's knowledge , he sent an excerpt to his friend , the fantasy writer Neil Gaiman . Gaiman later said , " It was terrifying from my point of view to read this first short story that had so much assurance ... It was like watching someone sit down to play the piano for the first time and she plays a sonata . " Gaiman showed the story to his friend , science @-@ fiction writer and editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden . Clarke learned of these events when Hayden called and offered to publish her story in his anthology Starlight 1 ( 1996 ) , which featured pieces by well @-@ regarded science @-@ fiction and fantasy writers . She accepted and the book won the World Fantasy Award for best anthology in 1997 . 
 The story is set in early 19th century Gloucestershire and concerns the friendship of three young women , Cassandra <unk> , Miss Tobias , and Mrs. Fields . Though the events of the story do not actually appear in Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell , they are referenced in a footnote in Chapter 43 . Clarke has said : 
 For a long time it was my hope that these three ladies should eventually find a place in [ Jonathan Strange ] ... I decided there was no place for them ... I deliberately kept women to the domestic sphere in the interests of authenticity ... it was important that real and alternate history appeared to have converged . This meant that I needed to write the women and the servants , as far as possible , as they would have been written in a 19th @-@ century novel . 
 Reviewers of the short story collection highlighted this tale , one calling it " the most striking story " of the volume and " a staunchly feminist take on power relations " . Victoria Hoyle in Strange Horizons writes in particular that " there is something incredibly precise , clean , and cold about Clarke 's portrayal of ' women 's magic ' in this story ( and throughout the collection ) — it is urgent and desperate , but it is also natural and in the course of things . " 
 " On <unk> Hill " is a retelling of the Rumplestiltskin tale . Narrated by the 17th @-@ century Suffolk bride Miranda <unk> , it tells of how she resorts to magic to spin enough flax to satisfy her husband 's demands . As Hoyle explains , in order to avoid " imprisonment , murder , dismemberment , or sexual slavery " , Miranda must defeat not only her captor but also the man attempting to save her . The story satirizes the antiquarian John Aubrey and his ilk , as Aubrey 's advice to Miranda and her husband turns out to be largely worthless . Written in the form of an old diary , the text includes archaic spellings ; for example , Miranda 's assistant is described as " [ a ] small black <unk> . <unk> . <unk> like jug @-@ handles . Face – not a <unk> handsome . " 
 " Mrs Mabb " is a story about a 19th @-@ century woman , Venetia Moore , whose fiancé , Captain Fox , leaves her for the mysterious Mrs. Mabb ( who turns out to be Queen Mab ) . Devastated , Venetia attempts to get him back . In the process , she becomes enchanted and , for example , ends up wandering around a cemetery with bleeding bare feet . The community assumes she is insane . However , as Lucy Atkins in The Times notes , who calls this " most memorable " story of the collection , " for her this is not madness , it is persistence . " As Hoyle argues , in this story Clarke toys with the stereotypes of women as both hysterical and intuitive . 
 " The Duke of Wellington <unk> His Horse " is set in the village of Wall , which is part of Gaiman 's novel Stardust ( also illustrated by Vess ) . In this story , the Duke enters Faerie , where he finds a Lady of Shalott figure embroidering a tapestry of what appears to be his future . Frustrated by the seeming inevitability of his fate , he <unk> her tapestry and <unk> his own future to match his desires . Hoyle calls this story " trite " and " cliched " , however . 
 " Mr Simonelli , or the Fairy Widower " is presented as an extract from Allessandro Simonelli 's journal and describes his conflict with an amoral Faerie aristocrat . It is presented , in the words of Tim Martin of The Independent , in " the creaking diary form of Bram Stoker " . Simonelli must propose to each of the five Gathercole sisters , who resemble the Bennetts from Jane Austen 's Pride and Prejudice , in order to save them from John <unk> . The tale is related by : 
 Simonelli , the unreliable and otherwise morally deplorable narrator ... [ and ] the bastard child of an elusive stranger who might have been Italian , but was actually a fairy . In this story Clarke plays ( as she did in her novel ) with analogies between racial otherness and the uncanny , while simultaneously presenting us with a narrative of subtly layered ironies set in a vividly evoked landscape , part Peak District , part fantasy of Burkean sublimity . 
 " Tom Brightwind , or How the Fairy Bridge was Built at <unk> " is set during the 18th century and tells the story of a Jewish @-@ Venetian doctor , David Montefiore , and his fairy friend , Tom Brightwind . The fictional Professor Sutherland remarks in a note to the story that it " suffers from all the usual defects of second @-@ rate early @-@ 19th @-@ century writing " . In his review of the collection , Steven H. Silver writes that " the story is diverting , made even more interesting by the copious asides explaining fairy culture . " 
 " <unk> and Frets " is a fictionalized version of the detention of Mary , Queen of Scots , by Bess of Hardwick and George Talbot , 6th Earl of Shrewsbury . After discovering that Bess murdered her husband using magic , Mary attempts to learn her secret knowledge to assist in her own political plots . The story was first published in The New York Times immediately after the release of Jonathan Strange . 
 " John Uskglass and the Cumbrian Charcoal Burner " is a " ribald piece of pseudo @-@ folklore " about John Uskglass , who was a central figure in Jonathan Strange . It is " an anarchic medieval triumph @-@ of @-@ the @-@ peasantry tale " in which the " pagan power of <unk> [ is ] outwitted by the Christian saints " . Hoyle notes that this story , the only one not previously published , was used to sell the volume , but that it is not as " sinister " as the others and lacks " Clarke 's usual imaginative feeling " .

 Published in October 2006 , the collection received many positive reviews , though some critics compared the short stories unfavorably with the highly acclaimed and more substantial Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell ( 2004 ) . Karen Luscombe of The Globe and Mail called the collection " mesmerizing " . She praised the tone of the collection , describing it as " delicious [ ly ] macabre ... exquisitely balanced by an equally delectable sense of satire " . For example , a magician tries to find a spell " for turning Members of Parliament into useful members of society " but cannot find one . However , Graham Joyce of The Washington Post complained that while Jonathan Strange " was celebrated for its literary touch and its filigree attention to detail " , The Ladies of Grace Adieu lacks of the " density " of the novel and " without the scope and the escapist <unk> seal of Strange & Norrell , the stories become suddenly exposed as light @-@ as @-@ a @-@ feather <unk> " . She furthered criticized the characters ' asexuality and " emotionally disengage [ ment ] " , arguing that " there is a kind of darkness , but there is no shadow . " In her review in Strange Horizons , Hoyle agreed with Joyce 's general review , writing " the stories ... are consistently subtle and enchanting , and as charismatic as any reader could wish , but , while the collection has the panache of the novel , it lacks its glorious self @-@ possession . " In the end , she said that : 
 we would be best to read these stories as a series of extended footnotes , the kind for which Clarke is famous . They continue to play on the riffs — of Faerie , power , and gender — that were established in her novel , but really , they 're something else , a sideline in storytelling and representative of Clarke 's much wider interests as a writer of English mythology and folklore . 
 The story Mrs Mabb was dramatised on BBC Radio 4 in 2008 , starring Bertie Carvel as Captain Fox . He went on to play Jonathan Strange in the 2015 BBC TV dramatisation of Clarke 's novel Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell .

 = Parks and Recreation ( season 3 ) = 
 The third season of Parks and Recreation originally aired in the United States on the NBC television network between January 20 and May 19 , 2011 . Like the previous seasons , it focused on Leslie Knope ( Amy Poehler ) and her staff at the parks and recreation department of the fictional Indiana town of Pawnee . The season featured 16 episodes , most of which were approximately 22 minutes long each and aired at 9 : 30 p.m. on Thursdays . 
 All of the members of the original cast returned for the third season except Paul Schneider , who previously played city planner Mark Brendanawicz . Rob Lowe and Adam Scott , who appeared as guest stars in the second season , began season three as regular cast members playing Chris Traeger and Ben Wyatt , respectively . The season also featured guest appearances by Megan Mullally , Will Forte and Parker Posey , among others . 
 To accommodate Amy Poehler 's pregnancy , the first six episodes of the third season were filmed immediately after season two wrapped so they could be saved for a projected September 2010 air date . However , after the episodes were finished , NBC postponed the season premiere until January to accommodate their new series , Outsourced . The third season consisted of several major story arcs , including a complete shutdown of the Pawnee government for budgetary reasons , inspired by the real @-@ life global financial crisis . Other storylines included the parks department 's organization of a harvest festival , a romance between Leslie and Ben , and the dating and eventual marriage of Andy Dwyer ( Chris Pratt ) and April Ludgate ( Aubrey Plaza ) . 
 As in the previous season , Parks and Recreation was critically acclaimed during its third season , and was declared by several reviewers to be one of the best comedies on television . Entertainment Weekly featured it on its cover in February 2011 and declared it " the smartest comedy on TV " . The episodes " Harvest Festival " and " Li 'l Sebastian " received particularly positive reviews , as did Nick Offerman in his role as parks director Ron Swanson . Parks and Recreation received its first nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series for its third season , and Poehler received her second nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series . Nevertheless , Parks and Recreation continued to struggle in the Nielsen ratings and averaged about 4 @.@ 75 million household viewers per week .

 Almost the entire original cast from season two returned for the third season , including Amy Poehler , Rashida Jones , Aziz Ansari , Nick Offerman , Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt . The only permanent cast member not to return was Paul Schneider , who previously played city planner Mark Brendanawicz . Schneider departed from the series at the end of season two . Jim O 'Heir and Retta , who made regular appearances as parks employees Jerry Gergich and Donna Meagle during the first two seasons , were considered members of the regular cast starting in season three , although they still do not appear in the opening credits . Adam Scott , who portrayed state auditor Ben Wyatt in the final two episodes of the second season , became a regular cast member starting in season three , and Rob Lowe , who appeared in the same two second season episodes as state auditor Chris Traeger , also joined the cast in season three . Lowe was originally meant only to make a string of performances in seasons two and three and then depart the show , but he instead become a regular cast member starting with the third season , having signed a multi @-@ year contract to remain on the show . After actor Charlie Sheen was fired from the CBS comedy series Two and a Half Men in March 2011 , rumors circulated that Rob Lowe would depart Parks and Recreation and replace Sheen , but they proved unfounded . 
 Nick Offerman 's wife Megan Mullally , who previously played Ron Swanson 's ex @-@ wife Tammy in the episode " Ron and Tammy " , reprised that role in " Ron & Tammy : Part Two " , and briefly appeared as the character in the season finale " Li 'l Sebastian " . Will Forte , a comedian who previously starred on the sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live along with Amy Poehler , guest @-@ starred in " Time Capsule " as a Pawnee resident demanding the Twilight books be added to the town 's time capsule . Parker Posey , who previously starred with Poehler in the 2009 comedy film Spring Breakdown , appeared in " Eagleton " as Leslie 's former best friend and rival official from a neighboring town . Posey had been in discussions with the Parks and Recreation staff to make a guest appearance since the show debuted , and grew frustrated when it took several months before she received an invitation . 
 Several actors who had appeared in previous seasons of Parks and Recreation continue to appear in the third season , including Ben Schwartz as Tom 's cocky and entrepreneurial friend Jean @-@ Ralphio Saperstein ; Natalie Morales as bartender and Tom 's girlfriend Lucy ; Jama Williamson as Wendy , Tom 's ex @-@ wife who starts dating Ron ; Pamela Reed as Leslie 's mother Marlene Griggs @-@ Knope ; Alison Becker as newspaper reporter Shauna Malwae @-@ Tweep ; Darlene Hunt as conservative activist Marcia Langman ; Mo Collins as morning talk show host Joan Callamezzo ; Jay Jackson as television newscaster Perd Hapley ; Andy Forrest as Andy 's frequent shoeshine customer Kyle , and Kirk Fox as sleazy sewage department employee Joe . Eric Pierpoint appeared in " Ron & Tammy : Part Two " and " Eagleton " as Hugh Trumple , chief of the Pawnee police department . Comedians Matt Besser and Nick Kroll appeared in " Media Blitz " as " Crazy Ira and The Douche " , the hosts of a Pawnee morning zoo @-@ style radio show . Besser had previously been on the sketch comedy show and troupe Upright Citizens Brigade with Poehler . Detlef Schrempf , a retired Indiana Pacers basketball player who played himself in the second season episode " Telethon " , appeared again in " Li 'l Sebastian " . Jonathan Joss , who previously voiced John <unk> in the animated television series King of the Hill — which was co @-@ created by Parks and Recreation co @-@ creator Greg Daniels — guest starred in " Harvest Festival " as the local Native American tribe leader . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Toward the end of production on the second season , lead actor Amy Poehler became pregnant and the producers of the show were forced to go into production on season three early and film an additional six episodes to accommodate not only Poehler 's pregnancy , but also a projected September 2010 air date . Amy Poehler said the cast was " a little fried " by the intense shooting schedule , but that the addition of Adam Scott and Rob Lowe to the cast provided an energy boost . Since Poehler was six months pregnant at the time of filming the first six episodes , she was often strategically placed behind items to conceal her belly . Although the third episode to be shown , " Time Capsule " was the last of these six episodes to be filmed because the story presented the highest amount of props to place Poehler in front of objects to hide her pregnancy , most notably the time capsule itself . 
 However , NBC eventually opted not to put the show on the fall schedule , and instead delayed the premiere of the third season until the beginning of 2011 . This allowed for the network to run its new comedy , Outsourced , in two @-@ hour comedy schedule block rather than Parks and Recreation . The schedule change meant that all sixteen episodes from the third season would be filmed before any of them were shown ; the rest of the episodes , starting with the seventh , were filmed in the fall of 2010 . NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation , and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no negative effect on the show , but could actually build anticipation for its return . Series co @-@ creator Michael Schur said the schedule changes were frustrating , but said : " It sounds a little corny , maybe even a little community theater @-@ ish , but when we got the bad news our thinking was to just put our heads down and keep making the best show we could . " Amy Poehler said of the hiatus , " It was an NBC decision and certainly we were confused . But I think , weirdly , there 's a momentum that comes from people waiting for us , which is nice . " Poehler also said it gave them the luxury of time to go back and <unk> episodes or shoot and add new material . 
 As in previous seasons , filming of the third season of the series included a large amount of improvisation from the cast . For example , during one scene in " The Fight " in which almost the entire cast becomes intoxicated at the Snakehole Lounge bar , each actor spent about two days on their own filming their own individual scenes . Much of the filming was improvised , including shots used in a montage sequence that showed how drunk each character had become by the end of the night . Amy Poehler described the filming as " the most fun I 've ever had " . Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally also improvised a great deal of their scenes during the filming of " Ron & Tammy : Part Two " . The third season continued to use several visual and camera techniques that had been introduced in past seasons . In the past , Poehler would improvise several different jokes during a take , and they would be intermingled into a montage of jump cuts featuring many of the jokes . That technique was used prominently in " Indianapolis " during a scene in which Leslie comforts Ann with stories about multiple times Leslie was dumped in the past . The same technique was used by Aziz Ansari in " Soulmates " , during a scene in which Tom describes many slang nicknames he has given to foods , and in " The Fight " , in which Tom describes many strange entrepreneurial idea he has come up with . 
 The " Harvest Festival " episode featured an elaborate festival setting and corn maze sets . Due to budget restraints , the Parks and Recreation set department did not build the set , but instead used a real @-@ life setting at Los Angeles Pierce College , a community college in California which holds an annual festival event . Michael Schur said the aerial shot of the harvest festival at the end of the episode was the most expensive shot in the entire series . The episode was filmed out of sequence from the rest of the season so the weather would be cooler when the scenes were shot ; Schur jokingly said if this was not done , " the week that we would have been shooting it was like 148 degrees here and the actors would be dead now " . The Eagleton public forum scene in the episode " Eagleton " was shot at the Toluca Lake Sports Center in the Toluca Lake district of Los Angeles . The season finale " Li 'l Sebastian " saw the introduction of the headquarters for Tom and Jean @-@ Ralphio 's new company , Entertainment 720 . The setting was a completely white 15 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 400 m2 ) room with modern decor and unusual furniture , and Michael Schur described the setting as , " Maybe the craziest thing that 's ever been on our series ... It 's truly nuts . It 's like a hallucinogenic nightmare . " 
 After the original broadcast of " Ron & Tammy : Part Two " , NBC ran a commercial advertising " April and Andy 's wedding registry " on the official Parks and Recreation website . At this point in the season , April and Andy were separated and had not yet reconciled . Shortly after the episode aired , HitFix television reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote that the commercial mistakenly used the wrong names and was actually referring to Ron and Tammy 's wedding registry . However , after " Andy and April 's Fancy Party " aired , Schur admitted the commercial was intended to run with that episode , but ran with " Ron & Tammy : Part Two " due to an error by NBC employees : Schur said afterward , " We sincerely hope that fans of the show are cool with us gently lying to them , in an effort to maintain the surprise nuptials as much as we could . "

 The financial difficulties Pawnee experiences during the third season were reflective of the financial crisis facing the nation and much of the world when the episodes were produced . The idea of state auditors visiting Pawnee , and the subsequent government shutdown , were inspired by news reports at the time of a number of states that were considering a shut down of schools , parks and other services due to the global recession . Amy Poehler described one of the early themes of the season as Leslie Knope trying to maintain her optimism about public service in the face of economic cutbacks and cynicism about government : " How does one person work in government and not become cynical ? How does someone believe that change could happen without losing faith ? " 
 Much of the first seven episodes of the season revolved around the characters organizing a harvest festival , which had previously been a Pawnee tradition before it ended . The storyline stemmed from serious budget problems facing Pawnee and the major cuts threatened to the parks department , which prompts Leslie to bring the harvest festival back and stake the future of the entire department on its success and failure . The festival served as a device to bring all the characters together working toward a common goal , similar to efforts to turn a construction pit into a park during the first two seasons . Schur said the harvest festival story arc was written in part because the first six episodes were written and filmed early , so the writing staff felt having one concise storyline to tie them together kept the show focused . Schur also said the writers were fatigued from working on six third season episodes immediately after the second season , so the harvest festival story arc helped " organize our tired , end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ year brains " . 
 One of the biggest story arcs of the third season was the romance between Leslie and Ben , which slowly developed throughout the series until they officially began dating in the episode " Road Trip " despite a strict policy against workplace dating at city hall . The development of Ben 's feelings for Leslie coincide with his growing appreciation for Pawnee ; the character never had a firm sense of home due to the excessive amount of traveling with his job , but throughout the season Ben gradually falls in love with the town due to the optimism and enthusiasm Leslie Knope shows for Pawnee and her job . The no @-@ dating policy , imposed by Chris , stemmed from real life policies in small town governments , which Schur said were considered very important because " these people are handling taxpayer money , so relationships are even more frowned upon than they are in the private sector " . During the season finale " Li 'l Sebastian " , Leslie is encouraged by political operatives to run for office , but is asked whether there any potential scandals that could risk becoming public . Leslie denies there are any , but it is suggested her secret relationship with Ben could become such a scandal . 
 The first five episodes of the season involve Andy and his attempt to win back the affections of April , who previously had feelings for Andy , but became angry after Ann kissed him in the second season finale , " Freddy Spaghetti " . The two reconcile in " Media Blitz " , which Schur described as a " key moment " in their relationship , " almost like Andy 's a Knight of the Round Table , and he 's got a lot of different obstacles that he 's got to overcome in order to win the love of a fair maiden " . Andy and April become married during a surprise wedding four episodes later in " Andy and April 's Fancy Party " . Schur said the decision to have them marry after only briefly dating stemmed from the writing staff 's desire to " avoid the standard @-@ issue TV romance plots : fights , other men / women driving them apart , and so on " . They decided a fast marriage was funny , but also made sense because the characters are " two impulsive goofballs who don ’ t approach their lives in a responsible , adult manner " . 
 Michael Schur said another goal of the third season was to better demonstrate the comedic abilities of Rashida Jones , whose Ann Perkins character had often been portrayed as a straight man role to the other characters . This was done by placing Jones in a romantic relationship with Rob Lowe 's character Chris Traeger , who is so overly @-@ optimistic and seemingly @-@ perfect that Ann has trouble finding any flaws and is taken aback by him . Schur said : " Rashida is a very intelligent and attractive woman , and it 's hard to knock someone like that off balance . And the way to knock that person off balance is to get Rob Lowe in a relationship with you . " Ann is further taken out of her element when it is revealed in " Indianapolis " that Chris broke up with her , but did so in such a positive and upbeat way that Ann did not realize it for several days . Afterward , Ann continues to move away her previous straight man role by going on a string of dates with many random men . During the final episodes of the season , Ann takes a part @-@ time job at city hall as the health department public relations director , which Schur described as " the natural full circle from the beginning of the season " . This marked her process of getting over Chris and becoming a " more mature person " . Schur also said having Ann work at city hall would make it easier to integrate her into storylines with the other characters . 
 The character Tom Haverford also undergoes changes during the final episodes of the season , in which the character begins to consider leaving his city hall position to pursue his own business ambitions . The storyline is advanced particularly strongly in " The Bubble " , when Tom becomes frustrated with an assignment by Chris , and culminates in the season finale " Li 'l Sebastian " , in which he ultimately quits the parks department to form an entertainment company . " Li 'l Sebastian " ends with several cliffhanger twists including Tom 's departure from city hall , Leslie being approached to run for office , and the arrival of Ron 's first ex @-@ wife Tammy , although the actress who will play her was not revealed . Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go , but the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet when the episodes broadcast . Schur said they sought to " write the juiciest , most exciting cliffhanger @-@ y possible scenario you can write , and then you have all summer to figure out how to get yourself out of it " .

 While Parks and Recreation previously aired on 8 : 30 p.m. EST on Thursdays , the third season marked its debut in a 9 : 30 p.m. Thursday timeslot effective January 20 , 2011 , airing between the two popular series The Office and 30 Rock . Poehler said of the time @-@ slot , " ' The Office ' is such an amazing show and to be behind it is an honor . " The Parks producers hoped the Office lead @-@ in would bring new viewers , and so the season premiere " Go Big or Go Home " included an introductory sequence that described the previous events of the series . In some cases , " Producer 's Cut " versions of third season episodes were made available on the official NBC website after they were broadcast . These cuts were about five minutes longer than the televised version and included several scenes that were originally cut due to length limitations . The episodes to receive " Producer 's Cuts " included " Harvest Festival " , " The Fight " and " Li 'l Sebastian " . 
 During its original broadcast , the episode " Jerry 's Painting " ran for an extended 40 minutes rather than the usual 30 minutes because it followed " Goodbye , Michael " , an extended episode of The Office that featured the final appearance of Steve Carell as a regular cast member . " The Fight " and " Road Trip " ran back @-@ to @-@ back during their original broadcast on May 12 , 2011 , as did " The Bubble " and " Li 'l Sebastian " on May 19 . The four were stand @-@ alone episodes that were not originally designed to be shown together , However , because the third season premiered late as a mid @-@ season replacement in January , the episodes aired together so the series ' season would conclude at the end of the television season .

 Parks and Recreation continued to receive critical acclaim , as it did during the second season . The show was featured on the February 11 cover of Entertainment Weekly , where it was called " the smartest comedy on TV " and which included the article " The 101 Reasons We Love Parks and Recreation " . James Poniewozik of Time magazine called it " a fabulous season – the best thing on TV in 2011 so far " . Maureen Ryan of TV Squad called it one of the ten best shows of 2011 , and said the season saw major growth of both its major characters , especially Leslie Knope , along with the expansion of a strong cast of secondary and tertiary characters as well . New York magazine writer Willa Paskin praised the show for comedy grounded in optimism and characters who genuinely like each other , rather than the cynical humor more prevalent in other comedy shows of the time . Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called it a " remarkable season of TV comedy " without a single bad episode . Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said although he considered Parks and Recreation the funniest sitcom on television during its second season , " it somehow got even better " during the third . Scott Meslow of The Atlantic said during the third season , Parks and Recreation was " the funniest , sweetest , most consistent sitcom on television " , and that the way the characters were seeking new opportunities outside the parks department by the end of the season demonstrates the show is willing to change and is " not content to simply spin its wheels " . Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said he believed that the third season " will become to be recognized as one of the best seasons of any sitcom ever " , and that the characters and setting of Pawnee were so fully developed that he felt a close , personal connection to them . Henry Hanks of CNN called it " a near @-@ flawless season " . 
 " Harvest Festival " received particularly strong reviews , with New York magazine writer Steve Kandell calling it the most pivotal episode of the season in terms of " resolving and resetting narrative stakes " . Likewise , " Li 'l Sebastian " was praised by several reviewers as one of the best episodes of the season , and Henry Hanks called it " one of the funniest half @-@ hours of any show this season " . As in past seasons , Nick Offerman continued to receive critical acclaim for his performance as Ron Swanson . By the third season , the character had taken on a cult status , and the term " Ron Swanson " was so commonly discussed on the social @-@ networking website Twitter after " Andy and April 's Fancy Party " aired that it was listed among the site 's trending topics , which are indicative of being the most popular topics being discussed on Twitter at a given moment . Rob Lowe received particularly strong reviews for his performance in " Flu Season " where his normally extraordinarily @-@ physically fit character becomes extremely ill and hallucinatory when infected with the flu . Aziz Ansari received very positive reviews for his performance in " Soulmates " , as did Adam Scott for his performance in " Media Blitz " . While some commentators felt the Ann Perkins character seemed adrift and not working as well as the other cast members , others said they liked the new direction the character had taken this season . Eric Sundermann declared the relationship between Chris and Ann was described as " one of the most interesting parts of the show " , whereas Joel Keller of TV Squad felt it was poorly handled and made Ann too passive . Some reviewers said the town of Pawnee itself has developed into a rich and interesting setting , comparing it to Springfield in the Fox animated series The Simpsons . 
 = = = Ratings = = = 
 Despite the critical success , the third season of Parks and Recreation continued to suffer in the Nielsen ratings , just as it had during the second season . The average viewership for the 16 episodes of season three were 4 @.@ 75 million household viewers , a slight increase over season two 's 4 @.@ 68 million average , but lower than season one 's average of 5 @.@ 45 million households . Michael Schur partially attributed the continually low viewership to a decline in ratings for NBC in general , as well as changing viewer trends due to a large amount of available channels . He added : " I would love it if our ratings went up and up , and we 've done a pretty good job of making our show inviting and friendly , welcoming to new viewers . Other than that , I 'm not sure what else we can do . It ’ s very disconcerting . " 
 Parks and Recreation saw a slight increase in viewership during its first episodes . The season debut , " Go Big or Go Home " , was seen by an estimated 6 @.@ 19 million household viewers , according to Nielsen Media Research , with a 3 @.@ 2 rating / 8 share among viewers between ages 18 and 49 . It marked the series ' highest rating in that demographic , and the highest overall viewership since the series premiere episode from April 2009 , which was seen by 6 @.@ 77 million household viewers . The ratings quickly dropped , however , and by the third episode " Time Capsule " had dipped to 4 @.@ 95 million household viewers , a more than 17 percent decline from the previous episode , " Flu Season " . By the seventh episode , " Harvest Festival " , viewership had dropped to 4 @.@ 08 million households , one of the lowest ratings of the series . 
 The ratings increased slightly after that point , with the viewership for the next episode " Camping " jumping up 39 percent to 5 @.@ 15 million households . Ratings for the eleventh episode , " Jerry 's Painting " , were expected to be high due to a lead @-@ in from Steve Carell 's final episode as a regular cast member on The Office . However , the Parks and Recreation episode was seen by an estimated 4 @.@ 71 million household viewers , a drop from the previous episode " Soulmates " . Ratings were unusually low for Parks and Recreation during its last four episodes due to the timeslot changes and back @-@ to @-@ back pairing of the episodes : " The Fight " and " Road Trip " were seen by 4 @.@ 55 million and 3 @.@ 54 million households , respectively , while " The Bubble " and season finale " Li 'l Sebastian " were seen by 4 @.@ 27 and 3 @.@ 72 million households , respectively .

 = Heinrich event = 
 A Heinrich event is a natural phenomenon in which large <unk> of icebergs break off from glaciers and traverse the North Atlantic . First described by marine geologist Hartmut Heinrich , they occurred during the past glacial periods or " ice ages " and are particularly well documented for the last glacial period . The icebergs contained rock mass , which has been eroded by the glaciers , and as they melted , this matter was dropped onto the sea floor as ice rafted debris ( abbreviated to " IRD " ) . 
 The icebergs ' melting caused prodigious amounts of fresh water to be added to the North Atlantic . Such inputs of cold and fresh water may well have altered the density @-@ driven thermohaline circulation patterns of the ocean , and often coincide with indications of global climate fluctuations . 
 Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the cause of Heinrich events , most of which implies instability of the massive Laurentide ice sheet , a continental glacier covering North America during the last glacial period . Other northern hemisphere ice sheets were potentially involved as well ( Scandinavia , Iceland , Greenland ) . However , the initial cause of this instability is still debated . 
 = = Description = = 
 The strict definition of Heinrich events is the climatic event causing the IRD layer observed in marine sediment cores from the North Atlantic : a massive collapse of northern hemisphere ice shelves and the consequent release of a prodigious volume of icebergs . By extension , the name Heinrich events can also refer to the associated climatic anomalies registered at other places around the globe , at approximately the same time periods . The events are rapid : they last probably less than a millennium , a duration varying from one event to the next , and their abrupt onset may occur in mere years ( Maslin et al .. 2001 ) . Heinrich events are clearly observed in many North Atlantic marine sediment cores covering the last glacial period ; the lower resolution of the sedimentary record before this point makes it more difficult to deduce whether they occurred during other glacial periods in the Earth 's history . Some ( Broecker 1994 , Bond & Lotti 1995 ) identify the Younger Dryas event as a Heinrich event , which would make it H0 . 
 Heinrich events appear related to some , but not all , of the cold periods preceding the rapid warming events known as Dansgaard @-@ Oeschger ( D @-@ O ) events , which are best recorded in the <unk> Greenland ice core . However , difficulties in synchronising marine sediment cores and Greenland ice cores to the same time scale cast aspersions on the accuracy of that statement . 
 = = Potential climatic fingerprint of Heinrich events = = 
 Heinrich 's original observations were of six layers in ocean sediment cores with extremely high proportions of rocks of continental origin , " lithic fragments " , in the 180 μm to 3 mm size range ( Heinrich 1988 ) . The larger size fractions cannot be transported by ocean currents , and are thus interpreted as having been carried by icebergs or sea ice which broke off glaciers or ice shelves , and dumped on the sea floor as the icebergs melted . Geochemical analyses of the IRD can provide information about the origin of these debris : mostly the large Laurentide ice sheet then covering North America for Heinrich events 1 , 2 , 4 and 5 , and on the contrary European ice sheets for the minor events 3 and 6 . The signature of the events in sediment cores varies considerably with distance from the source region . For events of Laurentide origin , there is a belt of IRD at around 50 ° N , known as the <unk> belt , expanding some 3 @,@ 000 km ( 1 @,@ 865 mi ) from its North American source towards Europe , and thinning by an order of magnitude from the Labrador Sea to the European end of the present iceberg route ( Grousset et al . , 1993 ) . During Heinrich events , huge volumes of fresh water flow into the ocean . For Heinrich event 4 , based on a model study reproducing the isotopic anomaly of oceanic oxygen 18 , the fresh water flux has been estimated to 0 @.@ 29 ± 0 @.@ 05 Sverdrup with a duration of 250 ± 150 years ( Roche et al . , 2004 ) , equivalent to a fresh water volume of about 2 @.@ 3 million km ³ or a 2 ± 1 m sea @-@ level rise . 
 Several geological indicators fluctuate approximately in time with these Heinrich events , but difficulties in precise dating and correlation make it difficult to tell whether the indicators precede or lag Heinrich events , or in some cases whether they are related at all . Heinrich events are often marked by the following changes : 
 Increased δ18O of the northern ( Nordic ) seas and East Asian stalactites ( speleothems ) , which by proxy suggests falling global temperature ( or rising ice volume ) ( Bar @-@ Matthews et al . 1997 ) 
 Decreased oceanic salinity , due to the influx of fresh water

 = = Unusual Heinrich events = = 
 H3 and H6 do not share such a convincing suite of Heinrich event symptoms as events H1 , H2 , H4 , and H5 , which has led some researchers to suggest that they are not true Heinrich events . That would make Bond 's suggestion of Heinrich events fitting into a 7000 @-@ year cycle suspect . 
 Several lines of evidence suggest that H3 and H6 were somehow different from the other events . 
 Lithic peaks : a far smaller proportion of lithics ( 3000 vs. 6000 grains per gram ) is observed in H3 and H6 , which means that the role of the continents in providing sediments to the oceans was relatively lower . 
 <unk> dissolution : Foraminifera tests appear to be more eroded during H3 and H6 ( <unk> et al . , 1996 ) . That may indicate an influx of nutrient @-@ rich , hence corrosive , Antarctic Bottom Water by a reconfiguration of oceanic circulation patterns . 
 Ice provenance : Icebergs in H1 , H2 , H4 , and H5 appear to have flowed along the Hudson Strait ; H3 and H6 icebergs appear to have flowed across it ( Kirby and Andrews , 1999 ) . 
 Ice rafted debris distribution : Sediment transported by ice does not extend as far East during H3 / 6 . Hence some researchers have been moved to suggest a European origin for at least some H3 / 6 clasts : America and Europe were originally adjacent to one another ; hence , the rocks on each continent are difficult to distinguish , and the source is open to interpretation ( Grousset et al . 2000 ) . 
 = = Causes = = 
 As with so many climate related issues , the system is far too complex to be confidently assigned to a single cause . There are several possible drivers , which fall into two categories . 
 = = = Internal forcings — the " binge – purge " model = = = 
 This model suggests that factors internal to ice sheets cause the periodic disintegration of major ice volumes , responsible for Heinrich events . 
 The gradual accumulation of ice on the Laurentide ice sheet led to a gradual increase in its mass — the " binge phase " . Once the sheet reached a critical mass , the soft , unconsolidated sub @-@ glacial sediment formed a " slippery lubricant " over which the ice sheet slid — the " purge phase " , lasting around 750 years . The original model ( <unk> , 1993 ) proposed that geothermal heat caused the sub @-@ glacial sediment to thaw once the ice volume was large enough to prevent the escape of heat into the atmosphere . The mathematics of the system are consistent with a 7 @,@ 000 @-@ year periodicity , similar to that observed if H3 and H6 are indeed Heinrich events ( <unk> et al .. 2001 ) . However , if H3 and H6 are not Heinrich events , the Binge @-@ Purge model loses credibility , as the predicted periodicity is key to its assumptions . It may also appear suspect because similar events are not observed in other ice ages ( Hemming 2004 ) , although this may be due to the lack of high @-@ resolution sediments . In addition , the model predicts that the reduced size of ice sheets during the Pleistocene should reduce the size , impact and frequency of Heinrich events , which is not reflected by the evidence . 
 = = = External forcings = = = 
 Several factors external to ice sheets may cause Heinrich events , but such factors would have to be large to overcome attenuation by the huge volumes of ice involved ( <unk> 1993 ) . 
 Gerard Bond suggests that changes in the flux of solar energy on a 1 @,@ 500 @-@ year scale may be correlated to the Dansgaard @-@ Oeschger cycles , and in turn the Heinrich events ; however the small magnitude of the change in energy makes such an exo @-@ terrestrial factor unlikely to have the required large effects , at least without huge positive feedback processes acting within the Earth system . However , rather than the warming itself melting the ice , it is possible that sea level change associated with the warming destabilised ice shelves . A rise in sea level could begin to corrode the bottom of an ice sheet , undercutting it ; when one ice sheet failed and surged , the ice released would further raise sea levels — further destabilizing other ice sheets . In favour of this theory is the non @-@ simultaneity of ice sheet break up in H1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 , where European breakup preceded European melting by up to 1 @,@ 500 years ( Maslin et al . 2001 ) . 
 The Atlantic Heat Piracy model suggests that changes in oceanic circulation cause one hemisphere 's oceans to become warmer at the other 's expense ( <unk> and Maslin 2001 ) . Currently , the Gulf stream redirects warm , equatorial waters towards the northern Nordic Seas . The addition of fresh water to northern oceans may reduce the strength of the Gulf stream , and allow a southwards current to develop instead . This would cause the cooling of the northern hemisphere , and the warming of the southern , causing changes in ice accumulation and melting rates and possibly triggering shelf destruction and Heinrich events ( Stocker 1998 ) . 
 <unk> 's 2004 Bipolar model suggests that sea level rise lifted buoyant ice shelves , causing their destabilisation and destruction . Without a floating ice shelf to support them , continental ice sheets would flow out towards the oceans and disintegrate into icebergs and sea ice . 
 Freshwater addition has been implicated by coupled ocean and atmosphere climate modeling ( <unk> and <unk> 2001 ) , showing that both Heinrich and Dansgaard @-@ Oeschger events may show hysteresis behaviour . This means that relatively minor changes in freshwater loading into the Nordic Seas — a 0 @.@ 15 Sv increase , or 0 @.@ 03 Sv decrease — would suffice to cause profound shifts in global circulation ( <unk> et al . 2005 ) . The results show that a Heinrich event does not cause a cooling around Greenland but further south , mostly in the subtropical Atlantic , a finding supported by most available paleoclimatic data . This idea was connected to D @-@ O events by Maslin et al .. ( 2001 ) . They suggested that each ice sheet had its own conditions of stability , but that on melting , the influx of freshwater was enough to reconfigure ocean currents — causing melting elsewhere . More specifically , D @-@ O cold events , and their associated influx of meltwater , reduce the strength of the North Atlantic Deep Water current ( <unk> ) , weakening the northern hemisphere circulation and therefore resulting in an increased transfer of heat polewards in the southern hemisphere . This warmer water results in melting of Antarctic ice , thereby reducing density stratification and the strength of the Antarctic Bottom Water current ( <unk> ) . This allows the <unk> to return to its previous strength , driving northern hemisphere melting and another D @-@ O cold event . Eventually , the accumulation of melting reaches a threshold , whereby it raises sea level enough to undercut the Laurentide ice sheet — causing a Heinrich event and resetting the cycle . 
 Hunt & Malin ( 1998 ) proposed that Heinrich events are caused by earthquakes triggered near the ice margin by rapid deglaciation .

 Parker was born in Norfolk , Virginia , to Carolyn , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old mother at the time . His mother never married his biological father , but did wed the man who gave Parker his last name . Parker has four younger sisters . According to a DNA analysis , some of his ancestry is from the <unk> people of modern @-@ day Cameroon . During Parker 's time in middle school , his mother fell in love with Walter Whitfield , who was stationed in Bath , Maine , in the United States Air Force . Although his mother married Whitfield and moved to Maine , Parker , despite the physical distance after the move , remained close to his biological father emotionally . His father died when Parker was eleven , however . Parker became involved in classroom fights and home power struggles with his stepfather , Whitfield . Parker moved to Virginia Beach , Virginia to stay with his maternal uncle , Jay Combs , a former wrestler , at age 14 . Nate 's great @-@ grandmother got sick and his mother moved back to Hampton Roads , Virginia and lived in the Churchland High School zone , where Nate joined her . Sharing a three @-@ bedroom apartment with four uncles , his mom , aunt , and grandmother , Parker said " we didn 't have many material things but we loved each other unconditionally . " 
 Parker was accused of rape while a sophomore at Pennsylvania State University in 1999 and was cleared of those charges in 2001 . Parker married Sarah DiSanto — a native of Erie , Pennsylvania whom he met while they were attending Penn State — in Erie 's Frontier Park during the summer of 2007 . He is a University of Oklahoma alumnus .

 Because Parker looked up to Combs , Combs was able to get Parker started in Wrestling at Princess Anne High School . Parker placed third in the Virginia High School League state wrestling championships as a junior while attending Churchland after reuniting with his mother . Carolyn Whitfield moved to the Great Bridge High School district so Parker could participate in its powerhouse wrestling program . He was a member of the 1997 – 98 state champion Great Bridge wrestling team and was a state champion 135 @-@ pound ( 61 kg ) wrestler who placed third in the High School National Wrestling Championships , while becoming a high school All @-@ American . He earned a full scholarship to wrestle at Penn State University . 
 At Penn State , Parker was nationally ranked as a freshman . After transferring he continued to be ranked as a redshirt junior 141 @-@ pound ( 64 kg ) wrestler . In 2002 , he placed fifth at the National Collegiate Athletic Association wrestling championships and became an All @-@ American at Oklahoma . Following his fifth @-@ place finish , he was ranked second nationally as a redshirt senior . In 2003 , he earned an undergraduate degree in computer programming from Oklahoma . After graduating from Oklahoma , he worked as a computer programmer until he was noticed at a modeling convention in Dallas , Texas , while accompanying a model friend . 
 = = Acting career = = 
 Parker 's first profession was as a computer programmer , which he described as being " in a cubicle writing code " . Then , he attended an event in Dallas with a model he was in a relationship with . Los Angeles talent manager Jon Simmons noticed Parker at the convention and talent search while Parker was waiting for his friend to finish her audition . Simmons felt Parker had " the look " and inquired about whether Parker was an actor or a model . After Parker denied both , he asked Parker to read a monologue from The Fast and The Furious . He then asked Parker to videotape himself doing lines from Antwone Fisher and Parker delivered a video within a week . Simmons told him to move to Los Angeles , California right away . Parker packed his clothes and computer and moved to sleep on another aspiring actor 's couch . He quickly landed a part in a television commercial . Bit parts and guest appearances followed . He has been working with acting coach Cary Anderson since arriving in Los Angeles . As of early 2008 , Parker continued to live in North Hollywood , California with his wife , mother and three of his sisters in a 650 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 60 m2 ) one @-@ bedroom apartment . 
 Parker played the male lead in Rome & Jewel , a hip @-@ hop take on Romeo and Juliet in 2006 . He had a smaller role in Pride , about an African American swim team , but one that allowed him to display his athletic physique . 
 Denzel Washington directed The Great Debaters and selected Parker for the role of Henry Lowe . Parker heard Washington requires biographies of the characters that he directs . He wrote a 100 @-@ page biography of the Henry Lowe character . To prepare for his role and write a character biography , he read the works of James Joyce , D.H. Lawrence , W.B. Yeats , Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes . The character was based on the real @-@ life debater , Henry Heights . Parker 's character is the love interest of <unk> Smollett 's character and has a bad @-@ boy streak . Parker also performed on the soundtrack . Parker , and co @-@ stars Forest Whitaker , and Denzel Washington were nominated for the 2008 NAACP Image Awards in the best supporting actor category , which Denzel Washington won . 
 In The Secret Life of Bees he played the love interest of Alicia Keys ' character . The movie co @-@ starred Queen Latifah , Dakota Fanning , Jennifer Hudson , Alicia Keys , and Sophie Okonedo and was written and directed by Gina Prince @-@ <unk> based on the book of the same name by Sue Monk Kidd .

 For years Parker was interested in making a film based on the life of Nat Turner . In 2014 he announced that he had funding and was working on assembling his team , and that the film would be called The Birth of a Nation in an ironic tribute to the famously racist 1915 film of the same name . In addition to writing and directing Parker cast himself as Turner . Aja Naomi King , Armie Hammer and Gabrielle Union were also cast in key roles . Fox Searchlight Pictures acquired the distribution rights to the film for $ 17 @.@ 5 million at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival , which broke the record for the most paid for a Sundance Film Festival production surpassing Little Miss Sunshine , which had been acquired by Searchlight for $ 10 million ten years earlier .

 = March of loyalty to martyrs = 
 The March of loyalty to martyrs ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) was a protest on 22 February 2011 in Manama , Bahrain . Tens of thousands participated in the protest , one of the largest in the Bahraini uprising . Named after the seven victims killed by police and army forces during previous protests , the march filled the space between Bahrain mall and Pearl Roundabout . Protesters carried Bahrain 's flag and demanded the fall of the government , implementation of a constitutional monarchy and other reforms , with some of them also demanding the end of the regime . 
 The march was named the largest in the country 's history by organizers ; sources estimated that over 100 @,@ 000 protesters ( 8 percent of Bahrain 's population ) participated , although other sources gave higher and lower estimations . A number of ambulance drivers , police and army officers joined the protest . Security forces were not present and unlike previous protests , it ended peacefully . 
 = = Background = = 
 Protests inspired by the successful uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia erupted in Bahrain on 14 February . Security forces responded by firing tear gas , rubber bullets , sound bombs and birdshot into the crowd of protesters . More than thirty protesters were injured and one died from birdshot injuries in his back . Another protester was killed the same way the next day , on 15 February , when over 10 @,@ 000 protesters occupied Pearl Roundabout . 
 On 17 February , police launched a pre @-@ dawn raid on sleeping protesters . Four protesters were killed and more than 300 were injured . Health workers and a journalist were allegedly attacked by security forces . The army was deployed after Pearl Roundabout was cleared of protesters and checkpoints were set up . Protesters moved to Salmaniya Hospital 's car parks where thousands protested against the government . 
 The following day , army forces stationed in the Pearl Roundabout fired live ammunition on hundreds of protesters who tried to re @-@ occupy the site . At least 120 protesters were hurt and one was fatally wounded , bringing the number of deaths to seven . The Crown Prince offered dialogue with opposition parties . On 19 February , tens of thousands of protesters re @-@ occupied Pearl Roundabout after the army was ordered to withdraw . 
 On 21 February , the king canceled the Formula 1 race originally scheduled for 13 March . The Associated Press named the decision " another victory " for protesters who had called for its cancellation . " We felt it was important for the country to focus on immediate issues of national interest and leave the hosting of Bahrain 's Formula One race to a later date " , the king stated . 
 In the evening , tens of thousands of government supporters , borrowing the anti @-@ government protesters ' slogan " no Sunni , no Shia , only Bahraini " , gathered in Al Fateh Mosque in Juffair . One participant interviewed by The New York Times said , " The democracy they have been asking for is already here , but the Shias , they have their <unk> , and whatever they say , they will run and do it . If they tell them to burn a house , they will . I think they have a clear intention to disrupt this country " . 
 The next day , appearing on Bahrain 's official news agency , the king ordered the release of 50 political prisoners , including 25 Shia activists arrested during the 2010 crackdown and accused of forming a " terrorist network " whose goal was to overthrow the government . Ali <unk> , a prominent blogger and founder of Bahrain Online opposition forum , was among those who were released . Blogger and human rights activist Abduljalil al @-@ Singace , who called the move " a good step " and a " positive gesture " , was also released . However , according to human rights activist Nabeel Rajab , about 400 more activists remained in prison on " politically inspired charges " . 
 = = Loyalty to Martyrs = = 
 In the afternoon of 22 February tens of thousands of children , men and women occupied and marched on the main streets of Manama . The march was called " The march of loyalty to martyrs " in reference to those killed in previous protests . It stretched for several miles , filling the eastern side of Sheik Khalifa bin Salman Highway from Bahrain Mall to Pearl Roundabout located in Manama 's business district . 
 The protesters , while carrying the white @-@ and @-@ red flag of Bahrain and posters of the seven victims , chanted : " Ash @-@ <unk> <unk> <unk> an @-@ nizam " ( " the people want to bring down the regime " ) , " Egypt , Tunisia , are we any different ? " and " No Shia , No Sunni , only Bahraini " . Most demanded the fall of the Bahrain government . " Some want the family out but most only the prime minister " , said a protester interviewed by BBC . The march was led by ambulance drivers who reported being attacked by security forces while trying to help treat protesters from the Pearl Roundabout injured on 17 February , which came to be called Bloody Thursday . 
 Protest organizers , which consisted of a loose coalition of seven political parties including Al Wefaq and Wa 'ad , named the march the largest in Bahrain 's history . Associated Press , The Huffington Post , The New York Times and Voice of America estimated that there were over 100 @,@ 000 participants . The New York Times described the number as " astonishing " , because Bahrain 's total population is a little over 500 @,@ 000 . The BBC described the course of march as a " sea of red and white flags " . Other estimates varied between 30 @,@ 000 and 200 @,@ 000 participants . In their documentary film Bahrain : Shouting in the Dark , Al Jazeera English stated , " Bahrain held its largest march in history ; the world media recorded nearly a quarter of all citizens in the streets " . The BICI report mentioned that " by many accounts more than 100 @,@ 000 people were marching " and that the number of protesters at Pearl Roundabout peaked at over 150 @,@ 000 . IFEX estimated the number to be as high as 200 @,@ 000 ; however , CNN Arabic said the number was just about 30 @,@ 000 . 
 Security forces did not intervene to disperse the march , however a state @-@ owned helicopter hovered overhead . A small number of police and army officers participated in the protest . Denouncing army troops who opened fire on protesters , an officer said , " What we did to the people was not heroic . We ask the people to forgive us , we ask the people for forgiveness " . Another officer added , " The weapons that have been used against the people are weapons of shame , these weapons should be used to protect the people , and not be used against them . That ’ s why we 've decided to be with the people " . 
 The widow of one of the seven " martyrs " read a statement after the march that listed the opposition 's demands ; the most important demands were the resignation of the forty @-@ year @-@ long government headed by the king 's uncle and the implementation of a constitutional monarchy . Other demands included the immediate commencement of an " impartial " investigation into the deaths , the neutralization of the state media and the release of the remaining " political " prisoners . Analysts stated that the large size of the protest pressured the government to concede to the protesters ' demands . Al Jazeera English said that " unless they offered deep reforms , the Khalifas will likely fall " . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Peaceful protests , including one pro @-@ government rally , continued throughout February and the first half of March , and drew tens of thousands of participants . On 8 March , unsatisfied by the government response , a coalition of three hard @-@ line Shia groups called for the abdication of the monarchy and the establishment of a democratic republic through peaceful means . Al Wefaq continued to demand an elected government and a constitutional monarchy . 
 In the following days protests intensified , moving to the Royal Court in Riffa , a royal palace in <unk> and finally blocking roads leading to the financial district in Manama . Security forces clashed with protesters using tear gas and rubber bullets , but police were overwhelmed by protesters . The government then requested help from neighbor countries , which sent about 1 @,@ 500 security forces to assist the government . A state of emergency was declared and the government launched a crackdown campaign to put down protests by force . The Pearl Roundabout , now cleared of protesters , was torn down by government and protesters found themselves pushed back into their villages . The government arrested over 1 @,@ 000 protesters including leading opposition and rights activists ( known as the Bahrain Thirteen ) as well as sportsmen , academics , businessmen , doctors , engineers , journalists and teachers .
