Ugra said that despite having Virender Sehwag and David Warner as the openers , bowler <unk> Morkel was the key player in the tournament , and Umesh Yadav was a nice assistant for him . Shahbaz Nadeem acted as a " tidy option " for a team which lacked spinners . Venugopal Rao , brought for $ 700 @,@ 000 , was termed as a " flop buy " by Ugra . Rao made 122 runs in ten matches , and had a strike @-@ rate lower than 104 . The team was captained by Sehwag , with Jayawardene acting as the stand @-@ in captain in two matches .

The team 's next fixture was also against the Royals , which was a six @-@ wicket win . Sehwag scored 73 runs from 38 balls , extending his record to five consecutive fifties . In the " clash between the two most impressive teams in the tournament , " the Knight Riders beat the Daredevils by six wickets . This caused the Daredevils to lose the top spot in the points table , a position it had held " virtually from the start of the tournament " .

" The Daredevils managed to score 144 runs for eight wickets , losing the match by 18 runs . In the second qualifier against the Super Kings , Morkel was benched , a decision which made a " significant difference " . " Virtually unknown <unk> " Sunny Gupta made his IPL debut in the match , and this was " one of the biggest tactical goof @-@ ups in IPL history . " Murali Vijay scored a century for the Super Kings , and it reached to a total of 222 . Gupta conceded 47 runs in his three overs ; Aaron gave 63 in his four overs : the least economical bowling figure in IPL .

 By finishing third in the IPL , the Daredevils qualified for the 2012 CLT20 . Before the tournament , Morkel decided to play for the Daredevils and not for his home team the Titans . The franchise changed the team captain to Jayawardene as per the suggestion of Sehwag , who wanted to be " relieved of the responsibility " in order to " bat freely " . <unk> Salvi came in as a replacement for Aaron , who was going to go through tonsillectomy . Sehwag strained a ligament during the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 , due to which he was initially doubtful for the CLT20 ; however he recovered from the injury and played in the tournament . In his preview for ESPNcricinfo , Sidharth Monga said that the team had " some of the best names Twenty20 cricket can throw up . " He termed Morkel as the key player and <unk> Chand as the " surprise package " . However , he said that the team 's failure in big @-@ matches and lack of spinners were its weaknesses . The team had a practice match with the Sydney Sixers , which it lost by 5 wickets . 
 Directly qualifying to the group stage , two of the four group matches of the Daredevils were abandoned due to rain . It played its first match with the Knight Riders , and won it by 52 runs .

Playing against the Perth Scorchers , the Daredevils restricted its opponent to 121 runs , " a score which is rarely defended in Twenty20 cricket . " Morkel took three wickets for 19 runs , and the team 's " four @-@ pronged pace attack was at its best . " Chasing the total , only Sehwag , who made 52 runs , could reach the double figures among the top order . However <unk> 's 11 runs from seven balls helped the team eventually win the match . For the last league match against the Titans , Jayawardene was replaced by Warner and Taylor was appointed as the captain . However the match was abandoned due to rain .

 = Swami Vivekananda = 
 Swami Vivekananda ( Bengali : <unk> ্ <unk> <unk> ্ <unk> ) Bengali : [ <unk> <unk> ] , <unk> <unk> ; 12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902 ) , born Narendranath Datta ( Bengali : <unk> ্ <unk> ্ <unk> <unk> ্ <unk> ) ( Bengali : [ <unk> ̪ ro nat ̪ ʰ d ̪ <unk> ̪ t ̪ o ] ) , was an Indian Hindu monk , a chief disciple of the 19th @-@ century Indian mystic Ramakrishna . He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness , bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century . He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India , and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India . Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission . He is perhaps best known for his speech which began , " Sisters and brothers of America ... , " in which he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World 's Religions in Chicago in 1893 . 
 Born into an aristocratic Bengali family of Calcutta , Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality . He was influenced by his Guru , Ramakrishna Deva , from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self ; therefore , service to God could be rendered by service to mankind . After Ramakrishna 's death , Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first @-@ hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in British India . He later travelled to the United States , representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World Religions . Vivekananda conducted hundreds of public and private lectures and classes , disseminating tenets of Hindu philosophy in the United States , England and Europe . In India , Vivekananda is regarded as a patriotic saint and his birthday is celebrated there as National Youth Day . 
 = = Early life ( 1863 – 88 ) = = 
 = = = Birth and childhood = = = 
 Vivekananda was born Narendranath Datta ( shortened to Narendra or Naren ) at his ancestral home at 3 <unk> Mukherjee Street in Calcutta , the capital of British India , on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival . He belonged to a traditional Bengali <unk> family and was one of nine siblings . His father , Vishwanath Datta , was an attorney at the Calcutta High Court . <unk> Datta , Narendra 's grandfather was a Sanskrit and Persian scholar who left his family and became a monk at age twenty @-@ five . His mother , <unk> Devi , was a devout housewife . The progressive , rational attitude of Narendra 's father and the religious temperament of his mother helped shape his thinking and personality . 
 Narendranath was interested spiritually from a young age , and used to meditate before the images of deities such as Shiva , Rama , Sita , and Mahavir Hanuman . He was fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks . Naren was naughty and restless as a child , and his parents often had difficulty controlling him . His mother said , " I prayed to Shiva for a son and he has sent me one of his ghosts " . 
 = = Education = = 
 In 1871 , at the age of eight , Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar 's Metropolitan Institution , where he went to school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877 . In 1879 , after his family 's return to Calcutta , he was the only student to receive first @-@ division marks in the Presidency College entrance examination . He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects , including philosophy , religion , history , social science , art and literature . He was also interested in Hindu scriptures , including the Vedas , the Upanishads , the Bhagavad Gita , the Ramayana , the Mahabharata and the Puranas . Narendra was trained in Indian classical music , and regularly participated in physical exercise , sports and organised activities . Narendra studied Western logic , Western philosophy and European history at the General Assembly 's Institution ( now known as the Scottish Church College ) . In 1881 he passed the Fine Arts examination , and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884 . Narendra studied the works of David Hume , Immanuel Kant , Johann Gottlieb Fichte , Baruch Spinoza , Georg W. F. Hegel , Arthur Schopenhauer , Auguste Comte , John Stuart Mill and Charles Darwin . He became fascinated with the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer and corresponded with him , translating Spencer 's book Education ( 1861 ) into Bengali . While studying Western philosophers , he also learned Sanskrit scriptures and Bengali literature . William Hastie ( principal of General Assembly 's Institution ) wrote , " Narendra is really a genius . I have travelled far and wide but I have never come across a lad of his talents and possibilities , even in German universities , among philosophical students ' Some accounts have called Narendra a <unk> ( a person with a prodigious memory ) . 
 = = = Spiritual apprenticeship - influence of Brahmo Samaj = = = 
 In 1880 Narendra joined Keshab Chandra Sen 's Nava Vidhan , which was established by Sen after meeting Ramakrishna and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism . Narendra became a member of a Freemasonry lodge " at some point before 1884 " and of the <unk> Brahmo Samaj in his twenties , a breakaway faction of the Brahmo Samaj led by Keshab Chandra Sen and Debendranath Tagore . From 1881 to 1884 he was also active in Sen 's Band of Hope , which tried to discourage youths from smoking and drinking . 
 It was in this cultic milieu that Narendra became acquainted with western esotericism . His initial beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts , which included belief in a formless God and the deprecation of idolatry , and a " streamlined , rationalized , monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic reading of the Upanisads and of the Vedanta . " <unk> Roy , the founder of the Brahmo Samaj who was strongly influenced by <unk> , strived toward an <unk> interpretation of Hinduism . His ideas were " altered [ ... ] considerably " by Debendranath Tagore , who had a romantic approach to the development of these new doctrines , and questioned central Hindu beliefs like reincarnation and karma , and rejected the authority of the Vedas . Tagore also brought this " neo @-@ Hinduism " closer in line with western esotericism , a development which was furthered by <unk> Sen. Sen was influenced by transcendentalism , an American philosophical @-@ religious movement strongly connected with <unk> , which emphasised personal religious experience over mere reasoning and theology . Sen strived to " an accessible , non @-@ <unk> , everyman type of spirituality " , introducing " lay systems of spiritual practice " which can be regarded as prototypes of the kind of Yoga @-@ exercises which Vivekananda popularised in the west . 
 The same search for direct intuition and understanding can be seen with Vivekananda . Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy , Narendra came to " the question which marked the real beginning of his intellectual quest for God . " He asked several prominent Calcutta residents if they had come " face to face with God " , but none of their answers satisfied him . At this time , Narendra met Debendranath Tagore ( the leader of Brahmo Samaj ) and asked if he had seen God . Instead of answering his question , Tagore said " My boy , you have the Yogi 's eyes . " According to <unk> , it was Ramakrishna who really answered Narendra 's question , by saying " Yes , I see Him as I see you , only in an infinitely <unk> sense . " Nevertheless , Vivekananda was more influenced by the Brahmo Samaj 's and its new ideas , than by Ramakrishna . It was Sen 's influence who brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism , and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna . 
 = = = With Ramakrishna = = = 
 In 1881 Narendra first met Ramakrishna , who became his spiritual focus after his own father had died in 1884 . 
 Narendra 's first introduction to Ramakrishna occurred in a literature class at General Assembly 's Institution when he heard Professor William Hastie lecturing on William Wordsworth 's poem , The Excursion . While explaining the word " trance " in the poem , Hastie suggested that his students visit Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar to understand the true meaning of trance . This prompted some of his students ( including Narendra ) to visit Ramakrishna . 
 They probably first met personally in November 1881 , though Narendra did not consider this their first meeting , and neither man mentioned this meeting later . At this time Narendra was preparing for his upcoming F. A. examination , when Ram Chandra Datta accompanied him to Surendra Nath Mitra 's , house where Ramakrishna was invited to deliver a lecture . According to <unk> , at this meeting Ramakrishna asked young Narendra to sing . Impressed by his singing talent , he asked Narendra to come to <unk> . 
 In late 1881 or early 1882 , Narendra went to Dakshineswar with two friends and met Ramakrishna . This meeting proved to be a turning point in his life . Although he did not initially accept Ramakrishna as his teacher and rebelled against his ideas , he was attracted by his personality and began to frequently visit him at Dakshineswar . He initially saw Ramakrishna 's ecstasies and visions as " mere figments of imagination " and " hallucinations " . As a member of Brahmo Samaj , he opposed idol worship , polytheism and Ramakrishna 's worship of Kali . He even rejected the Advaita Vedanta of " identity with the absolute " as blasphemy and madness , and often ridiculed the idea . Narendra tested Ramakrishna , who faced his arguments patiently : " Try to see the truth from all angles " , he replied . 
 Narendra 's father 's sudden death in 1884 left the family bankrupt ; creditors began demanding the repayment of loans , and relatives threatened to evict the family from their ancestral home . Narendra , once a son of a well @-@ to @-@ do family , became one of the poorest students in his college . He unsuccessfully tried to find work and questioned God 's existence , but found solace in Ramakrishna and his visits to Dakshineswar increased . 
 One day Narendra requested Ramakrishna to pray to goddess Kali for their family 's financial welfare . Ramakrishna suggested him to go to the temple himself and pray . Following Ramakrishna 's suggestion , he went to the temple thrice , but failed to pray for any kind of worldly necessities and ultimately prayed for true knowledge and devotion from the goddess . Narendra gradually grew ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God , and accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru . 
 In 1885 , Ramakrishna developed throat cancer , and was transferred to Calcutta and ( later ) to a garden house in Cossipore . Narendra and Ramakrishna 's other disciples took care of him during his last days , and Narendra 's spiritual education continued . At Cossipore , he experienced Nirvikalpa samadhi . Narendra and several other disciples received ochre robes from Ramakrishna , forming his first monastic order . He was taught that service to men was the most effective worship of God . Ramakrishna asked him to care for the other monastic disciples , and in turn asked them to see Narendra as their leader . Ramakrishna died in the early @-@ morning hours of 16 August 1886 in Cossipore . 
 = = = Founding of first Ramakrishna Math at Baranagar = = = 
 After Ramakrishna 's death , his devotees and admirers stopped supporting his disciples . Unpaid rent accumulated , and Narendra and the other disciples had to find a new place to live . Many returned home , adopting a Grihastha ( family @-@ oriented ) way of life . Narendra decided to convert a dilapidated house at Baranagar into a new math ( monastery ) for the remaining disciples . Rent for the Baranagar Math was low , raised by " holy begging " ( <unk> ) . The math became the first building of the Ramakrishna Math : the monastery of the monastic order of Ramakrishna . Narendra and other disciples used to spend many hours in practising meditation and religious austerities every day . Narendra later reminisced about the early days of the monastery : 
 We underwent a lot of religious practice at the Baranagar Math . We used to get up at 3 : 00 am and become absorbed in japa and meditation . What a strong spirit of detachment we had in those days ! We had no thought even as to whether the world existed or not . 
 In 1887 , Narendra compiled a Bengali song anthology named Sangeet Kalpataru with Vaishnav Charan <unk> . Narendra collected and arranged most of the songs of this compilation , but could not finish the work of the book for unfavourable circumstances .

 In December 1886 , the mother of <unk> invited Narendra and his other brother monks to Antpur village .

In Antpur , in the Christmas Eve of 1886 , Narendra and eight other disciples took formal monastic vows . They decided to live their lives as their master lived . Narendranath took the name " Swami Vivekananda " .

 In 1888 , Narendra left the monastery as a <unk> — the Hindu religious life of a wandering monk , " without fixed abode , without ties , independent and strangers wherever they go " . His sole possessions were a kamandalu ( water pot ) , staff and his two favourite books : the Bhagavad Gita and The Imitation of Christ . Narendra travelled extensively in India for five years , visiting centres of learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns . He developed sympathy for the suffering and poverty of the people , and resolved to uplift the nation . Living primarily on <unk> ( alms ) , Narendra travelled on foot and by railway ( with tickets bought by admirers ) . During his travels he met , and stayed with Indians from all religions and walks of life : scholars , <unk> , rajas , Hindus , Muslims , Christians , <unk> ( low @-@ caste workers ) and government officials . Narendra left Bombay for Chicago on 31 May 1893 with the name " Vivekananda " , as suggested by Ajit Singh of Khetri , which means " the bliss of discerning wisdom " . 
 = = First visit to the West ( 1893 – 97 ) = = 
 Vivekananda started his journey to the West on 31 May 1893 and visited several cities in Japan ( including Nagasaki , Kobe , Yokohama , Osaka , Kyoto and Tokyo ) , China and Canada en route to the United States , reaching Chicago on 30 July 1893 , where the " Parliament of Religions " took place in September 1893 . The Congress was an initiative of the Swedenborgian layman , and judge of the Illinois Supreme Court , Charles C. Bonney , to gather all the religions of the world , and show " the substantial unity of many religions in the good deeds of the religious life . " It was one of the more than 200 adjunct gatherings and congresses of the Chicago 's World 's Fair , and was " an avant @-@ garde intellectual manifestation of [ ... ] cultic milieus , East and West , " with the Brahmo Samaj and the Theosophical Society being invited as being representative of Hinduism . 
 Vivekananda wanted to join , but was disappointed to learn that no one without credentials from a bona fide organisation would be accepted as a delegate . Vivekananda contacted Professor John Henry Wright of Harvard University , who invited him to speak at Harvard . Vivekananda wrote of the professor , " He urged upon me the necessity of going to the Parliament of Religions , which he thought would give an introduction to the nation " . Vivekananda submitted an application , " introducing himself as a monk ' of the oldest order of <unk> ... founded by Sankara , ' " supported by the Brahmo Samaj representative <unk> <unk> , who was also a member of the Parliament 's selection committee , " classifying the Swami as a representative of the Hindu monastic order . " 
 = = = Parliament of the World 's Religions = = = 
 The Parliament of the World 's Religions opened on 11 September 1893 at the Art Institute of Chicago as part of the World 's Columbian Exposition . On this day , Vivekananda gave a brief speech representing India and Hinduism . He was initially nervous , bowed to Saraswati ( the Hindu goddess of learning ) and began his speech with " Sisters and brothers of America ! " . At these words , Vivekananda received a two @-@ minute standing ovation from the crowd of seven thousand . According to Sailendra Nath Dhar , when silence was restored he began his address , greeting the youngest of the nations on behalf of " the most ancient order of monks in the world , the Vedic order of sannyasins , a religion which has taught the world both tolerance , of and universal acceptance " . Vivekananda quoted two illustrative passages from the " Shiva <unk> <unk> " : " As the different streams having their sources in different places all mingle their water in the sea , so , O Lord , the different paths which men take , through different tendencies , various though they appear , crooked or straight , all lead to Thee ! " and " Whosoever comes to Me , through whatsoever form , I reach him ; all men are struggling through paths that in the end lead to Me . " According to Sailendra Nath Dhar , " [ i ] t was only a short speech , but it voiced the spirit of the Parliament . " 
 Parliament President John Henry Barrows said , " India , the Mother of religions was represented by Swami Vivekananda , the Orange @-@ monk who exercised the most wonderful influence over his auditors " . Vivekananda attracted widespread attention in the press , which called him the " cyclonic monk from India " . The New York Critique wrote , " He is an orator by divine right , and his strong , intelligent face in its picturesque setting of yellow and orange was hardly less interesting than those earnest words , and the rich , rhythmical utterance he gave them " . The New York Herald noted , " Vivekananda is undoubtedly the greatest figure in the Parliament of Religions . After hearing him we feel how foolish it is to send missionaries to this learned nation " . American newspapers reported Vivekananda as " the greatest figure in the parliament of religions " and " the most popular and influential man in the parliament " . The Boston Evening Transcript reported that Vivekananda was " a great favourite at the parliament ... if he merely crosses the platform , he is applauded " . He spoke several more times " at receptions , the scientific section , and private homes " on topics related to Hinduism , Buddhism and harmony among religions until the parliament ended on 27 September 1893 . Vivekananda 's speeches at the Parliament had the common theme of universality , emphasising religious tolerance . He soon became known as a " handsome oriental " and made a huge impression as an orator .

 After the Parliament of Religions , he toured many parts of the US as a guest . His popularity opened up new views for expanding on " life and religion to thousands " . During a question @-@ answer session at Brooklyn Ethical Society , he remarked , " I have a message to the West as Buddha had a message to the East . " 
 Vivekananda spent nearly two years lecturing in the eastern and central United States , primarily in Chicago , Detroit , Boston , and New York . He founded the Vedanta Society of New York in 1894 . By spring 1895 his busy , tiring schedule had affected his health . He ended his lecture tours and began giving free , private classes in Vedanta and yoga . Beginning in June 1895 , Vivekananda gave private lectures to a dozen of his disciples at Thousand Island Park in New York for two months . 
 During his first visit to the West he travelled to the UK twice , in 1895 and 1896 , lecturing successfully there . In November 1895 he met Margaret Elizabeth Noble an Irish woman who would become Sister Nivedita . During his second visit to the UK in May 1896 Vivekananda met Max Müller , a noted Indologist from Oxford University who wrote Ramakrishna 's first biography in the West . From the UK , Vivekananda visited other European countries . In Germany he met Paul Deussen , another Indologist . Vivekananda was offered academic positions in two American universities ( one the chair in Eastern Philosophy at Harvard University and a similar position at Columbia University ) ; he declined both , since his duties would conflict with his commitment as a monk . 
 His success led to a change in mission , namely the establishment of Vedanta centres in the West . Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his western audiences , who were especially attracted by and familiar with western esoteric traditions and movements like Transcendentalism and New thought . An important element in his adaptation of Hindu religiosity was the introduction of his " four yogas " model , which includes Raja yoga , his interpretation of Patanjali 's Yoga sutras , which offered a practical means to realise the divine force within which is central to modern western esotericism . In 1896 his book Raja Yoga was published , which became an instant success and was highly influential in the western understanding of Yoga . 
 Vivekananda attracted followers and admirers in the US and Europe , including Josephine MacLeod , William James , Josiah Royce , Robert G. Ingersoll , Nikola Tesla , Lord Kelvin , Harriet Monroe , Ella Wheeler Wilcox , Sarah Bernhardt , Emma Calvé and Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz . He initiated several followers : Marie Louise ( a French woman ) became Swami <unk> , and Leon Landsberg became Swami <unk> , so that they could continue the work of the mission of the Vedanta Society . This society still is filled with foreign nationals and is also located in Los Angeles . During his stay in America , Vivekananda was given land in the mountains to the southeast of San Jose , California to establish an retreat for Vedanta students . He called it " Peace retreat " , or , Shanti Asrama . The largest American centre is the Vedanta Society of Southern California in Hollywood , ( one of the twelve main centres ) . There is also a Vedanta Press in Hollywood which publishes books about Vedanta and English translations of Hindu scriptures and texts . Christina <unk> of Detroit was also initiated by Vivekananda with a mantra and she became Sister Christine , and they established a close father – daughter relationship . 
 From the West , Vivekananda revived his work in India . He regularly corresponded with his followers and brother monks , offering advice and financial support . His letters from this period reflect his campaign of social service , and were strongly worded . He wrote to <unk> , " Go from door to door amongst the poor and lower classes of the town of Khetri and teach them religion . Also , let them have oral lessons on geography and such other subjects . No good will come of sitting idle and having princely dishes , and saying " Ramakrishna , O Lord ! " — unless you can do some good to the poor " . In 1895 , Vivekananda founded the periodical <unk> to teach the Vedanta . Later , Vivekananda 's translation of the first six chapters of The Imitation of Christ was published in <unk> in 1889 . Vivekananda left for India on 16 December 1896 from England with his disciples Captain and Mrs. Sevier and J.J. Goodwin . On the way they visited France and Italy , and set sail for India from Naples on 30 December 1896 . He was later followed to India by Sister Nivedita , who devoted the rest of her life to the education of Indian women and India 's independence . 
 = = Back in India ( 1897 – 99 ) = = 
 The ship from Europe arrived in Colombo , British Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) on 15 January 1897 , and Vivekananda received a warm welcome . In Colombo he gave his first public speech in the East , India , the Holy Land . From there on , his journey to Calcutta was triumphant . Vivekananda travelled from Colombo to Pamban , Rameswaram , Ramnad , Madurai , Kumbakonam and Madras , delivering lectures . Common people and rajas gave him an enthusiastic reception . During his train travels , people often sat on the rails to force the train to stop so they could hear him . From Madras , he continued his journey to Calcutta and Almora . While in the West , Vivekananda spoke about India 's great spiritual heritage ; in India , he repeatedly addressed social issues : uplifting the people , eliminating the caste system , promoting science and industrialisation , addressing widespread poverty and ending colonial rule . These lectures , published as Lectures from Colombo to Almora , demonstrate his nationalistic fervour and spiritual ideology . 
 On 1 May 1897 in Calcutta , Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission for social service . Its ideals are based on Karma Yoga , and its governing body consists of the trustees of the Ramakrishna Math ( which conducts religious work ) . Both Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission have their headquarters at Belur Math . Vivekananda founded two other monasteries : one in Mayavati in the Himalayas ( near Almora ) , the Advaita Ashrama and another in Madras . Two journals were founded : <unk> Bharata in English and <unk> in Bengali . That year , famine @-@ relief work was begun by Swami <unk> in the Murshidabad district . 
 Vivekananda earlier inspired <unk> Tata to set up a research and educational institution when they travelled together from Yokohama to Chicago on Vivekananda 's first visit to the West in 1893 . Tata now asked him to head his Research Institute of Science ; Vivekananda declined the offer , citing a conflict with his " spiritual interests " . He visited Punjab , attempting to mediate an ideological conflict between Arya Samaj ( a reformist Hindu movement ) and <unk> ( orthodox Hindus ) . After brief visits to Lahore , Delhi and Khetri , Vivekananda returned to Calcutta in January 1898 . He consolidated the work of the math and trained disciples for several months . Vivekananda composed " <unk> Bhava – <unk> " , a prayer song dedicated to Ramakrishna , in 1898 . 
 = = Second visit to the West and final years ( 1899 – 1902 ) = = 
 Despite declining health , Vivekananda left for the West for a second time in June 1899 accompanied by Sister Nivedita and Swami <unk> . Following a brief stay in England , he went to the United States . During this visit , Vivekananda established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama ( peace retreat ) in California . He then went to Paris for the Congress of Religions in 1900 . His lectures in Paris concerned the worship of the lingam and the authenticity of the Bhagavad Gita . Vivekananda then visited Brittany , Vienna , Istanbul , Athens and Egypt . The French philosopher Jules Bois was his host for most of this period , until he returned to Calcutta on 9 December 1900 . 
 After a brief visit to the Advaita Ashrama in Mayavati Vivekananda settled at Belur Math , where he continued co @-@ ordinating the works of Ramakrishna Mission , the math and the work in England and the US He had many visitors , including royalty and politicians . Although Vivekananda was unable to attend the Congress of Religions in 1901 in Japan due to deteriorating health , he made pilgrimages to <unk> and Varanasi . Declining health ( including asthma , diabetes and chronic insomnia ) restricted his activity . 
 = = Death = = 
 On 4 July 1902 ( the day of his death ) Vivekananda awoke early , went to the chapel at Belur Math and meditated for three hours . He taught Shukla @-@ Yajur @-@ Veda , Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy of yoga to pupils , later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math . At 7 : 00 p.m. Vivekananda went to his room , asking not to be disturbed ; he died at 9 : 10 p.m. while meditating . According to his disciples , Vivekananda attained <unk> ; the rupture of a blood vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death . His disciples believed that the rupture was due to his <unk> ( an opening in the crown of his head ) being pierced when he attained <unk> . Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy that he would not live forty years . He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre on the bank of the Ganga in Belur , opposite where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen years earlier . 
 = = Teachings and philosophy = = 
 Vivekananda propagated that the essence of Hinduism was best expressed in Adi Shankara 's Advaita Vedanta philosophy . Nevertheless , following Ramakrishna , and in contrast to Advaita Vedanta , Vivekananda believed that the Absolute is both immanent and transcendent . According to Anil <unk> , Vivekananda 's neo @-@ Advaita " reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non @-@ dualism " . Vivekananda summarised the Vedanta as follows , giving it a modern and <unk> interpretation : 
 Each soul is potentially divine . The goal is to manifest this Divinity within by controlling nature , external and internal . Do this either by work , or worship , or mental discipline , or philosophy — by one , or more , or all of these — and be free . This is the whole of religion . Doctrines , or dogmas , or rituals , or books , or temples , or forms , are but secondary details . 
 Nationalism was a prominent theme in Vivekananda 's thought . He believed that a country 's future depends on its people , and his teachings focused on human development . He wanted " to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest " . 
 Vivekananda linked morality with control of the mind , seeing truth , purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it . He advised his followers to be holy , unselfish and to have <unk> ( faith ) . Vivekananda supported brahmacharya ( celibacy ) , believing it the source of his physical and mental stamina and eloquence . He emphasised that success was an outcome of focused thought and action ; in his lectures on Raja Yoga he said , " Take up one idea . Make that one idea your life – think of it , dream of it , live on that idea . Let the brain , muscles , nerves , every part of your body , be full of that idea , and just leave every other idea alone . This is the way to success , that is the way great spiritual giants are produced " . 
 = = Influence and legacy = = 
 Vivekananda was one of the main representatives of Neo @-@ Vedanta , a modern interpretation of selected aspects of Hinduism in line with western esoteric traditions , especially Transcendentalism , New Thought and Theosophy . His reinterpretation was , and is , very successful , creating a new understanding and appreciation of Hinduism within and outside India , and was the principal reason for the enthusiastic reception of yoga , transcendental meditation and other forms of Indian spiritual self @-@ improvement in the West . <unk> Bharati explained , " ... modern Hindus derive their knowledge of Hinduism from Vivekananda , directly or indirectly " . Vivekananda espoused the idea that all sects within Hinduism ( and all religions ) are different paths to the same goal . However , this view has been criticised as an oversimplification of Hinduism . 
 In the background of emerging nationalism in British @-@ ruled India , Vivekananda crystallised the nationalistic ideal . In the words of social reformer Charles Freer Andrews , " The Swami 's intrepid patriotism gave a new colour to the national movement throughout India . More than any other single individual of that period Vivekananda had made his contribution to the new awakening of India " . Vivekananda drew attention to the extent of poverty in the country , and maintained that addressing such poverty was a prerequisite for national awakening . His nationalistic ideas influenced many Indian thinkers and leaders . Sri Aurobindo regarded Vivekananda as the one who awakened India spiritually . Mahatma Gandhi counted him among the few Hindu reformers " who have maintained this Hindu religion in a state of splendor by cutting down the dead wood of tradition " . 
 The first governor @-@ general of independent India , Chakravarti Rajagopalachari , said " Vivekananda saved Hinduism , saved India " . According to Subhas Chandra Bose , a proponent of armed struggle for Indian independence , Vivekananda was " the maker of modern India " ; for Gandhi , Vivekananda 's influence increased Gandhi 's " love for his country a thousandfold " . Vivekananda influenced India 's independence movement ; his writings inspired independence activists such as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose , Aurobindo Ghose , Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bagha Jatin and intellectuals such as Aldous Huxley , Christopher Isherwood , Romain Rolland . Many years after Vivekananda 's death Rabindranath Tagore told French Nobel laureate Romain Rolland , " If you want to know India , study Vivekananda . In him everything is positive and nothing negative " . Rolland wrote , " His words are great music , phrases in the style of Beethoven , stirring rhythms like the march of Händel choruses . I cannot touch these sayings of his , scattered as they are through the pages of books , at thirty years ' distance , without receiving a thrill through my body like an electric shock . And what shocks , what transports , must have been produced when in burning words they issued from the lips of the hero ! " 
 <unk> Tata was inspired by Vivekananda to establish the Indian Institute of Science , one of India 's best @-@ known research universities . Abroad , Vivekananda communicated with orientalist Max Müller , and scientist Nikola Tesla was one of those influenced by his Vedic teachings . While National Youth Day in India is observed on his birthday , 12 January , the day he delivered his masterful speech at the Parliament of Religions , 11 September 1893 is " World Brotherhood Day " . In September 2010 , India 's Finance Ministry highlighted the relevance of Vivekananda 's teachings and values to the modern economic environment . The then Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee , the current President of India , approved in principle the Swami Vivekananda Values Education Project at a cost of ₹ 1 billion ( US $ 15 million ) , with objectives including involving youth with competitions , essays , discussions and study circles and publishing Vivekananda 's works in a number of languages . In 2011 , the West Bengal Police Training College was renamed the Swami Vivekananda State Police Academy , West Bengal . The state technical university in Chhattisgarh has been named the Chhattisgarh Swami Vivekananda Technical University . In 2012 , the Raipur airport was renamed Swami Vivekananda Airport . 
 The 150th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated in India and abroad . The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports in India officially observed 2013 as the occasion in a declaration . Year @-@ long events and programs were organised by branches of the Ramakrishna Math , the Ramakrishna Mission , the central and state governments in India , educational institutions and youth groups . Bengali film director Tutu ( <unk> ) Sinha made a film , The Light : Swami Vivekananda as a tribute for his 150th birth anniversary .

 Although Vivekananda was a powerful orator and writer in English and Bengali , he was not a thorough scholar , and most of his published works were compiled from lectures given around the world which were " mainly delivered [ ... ] impromptu and with little preparation " . His main work , Raja Yoga , consists of talks he delivered in New York . 
 = = = Literary works = = = 
 According to <unk> , " [ a ] singer , a painter , a wonderful master of language and a poet , Vivekananda was a complete artist " , composing many songs and poems , including his favourite , " Kali the Mother " . Vivekananda blended humour with his teachings , and his language was lucid . His Bengali writings testify to his belief that words ( spoken or written ) should clarify ideas , rather than demonstrating the speaker ( or writer 's ) knowledge . 
 Bartaman Bharat meaning " Present Day India " is an erudite Bengali language essay written by him , which was first published in the March 1899 issue of <unk> , the only Bengali language magazine of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission . The essay was reprinted as a book in 1905 and later compiled into the fourth volume of The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda . In this essay his refrain to the readers was to honour and treat every Indian as a brother irrespective of whether he was born poor or in lower caste .

 SM U @-@ 27 or U @-@ XXVII was the lead boat of the U @-@ 27 class of U @-@ boats or submarines for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . U @-@ 27 was built by the Austrian firm of Cantiere Navale Triestino ( CNT ) at the Pola Navy Yard and launched on 19 October 1916 . She was commissioned on 24 February 1917 . 
 She had a single hull and was just over 121 feet ( 37 m ) in length . She displaced nearly 265 metric tons ( 261 long tons ) when surfaced and over 300 metric tons ( 295 long tons ) when submerged . Her two diesel engines moved her at up to 9 knots ( 17 km / h ) on the surface , while her twin electric motors propeller her at up to 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ) while underwater . She was armed with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry a load of up to four torpedoes . She was also equipped with a 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) deck gun and a machine gun . 
 During her service career , U @-@ 27 sank the British destroyer Phoenix , damaged the Japanese destroyer Sakaki , and sank or captured 34 other ships totaling 14 @,@ 386 GRT . U @-@ 27 was surrendered at Pola at war 's end and handed over to Italy as a war reparation in 1919 . She was broken up the following year . Conway 's All the World 's Fighting Ships , 1906 – 1921 calls U @-@ 27 Austria @-@ Hungary 's " most successful submarine " . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Austria @-@ Hungary 's U @-@ boat fleet was largely obsolete at the outbreak of World War I. The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy satisfied its most urgent needs by purchasing five Type UB I submarines that comprised the U @-@ 10 class from Germany , by raising and recommissioning the sunken French submarine Curie as U @-@ 14 , and by building four submarines of the U @-@ 20 class that were based on the 1911 Danish Havmanden class . 
 After these steps alleviated their most urgent needs , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915 . The Germans were reluctant to allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro @-@ Hungarian construction , but were willing to sell plans for up to six of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria @-@ Hungary . The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen . 
 U @-@ 27 displaced 264 metric tons ( 260 long tons ) surfaced and 301 metric tons ( 296 long tons ) submerged . She had a single hull with saddle tanks , and was 121 feet 1 inch ( 36 @.@ 91 m ) long with a beam of 14 feet 4 inches ( 4 @.@ 37 m ) and a draft of 12 feet 2 inches ( 3 @.@ 71 m ) . For propulsion , she had two shafts , twin diesel engines of 270 bhp ( 200 kW ) for surface running , and twin electric motors of 280 shp ( 210 kW ) for submerged travel . She was capable of 9 knots ( 16 @.@ 7 km / h ) while surfaced and 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ) while submerged . Although there is no specific notation of a range for U @-@ 27 , the German UB II boats , upon which the U @-@ 27 class was based , had a range of over 6 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 000 km ) at 5 knots ( 9 @.@ 3 km / h ) surfaced , and 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ) at 4 knots ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ) submerged . U @-@ 27 class boats were designed for a crew of 23 – 24 . 
 U @-@ 27 was armed with two 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes and carried a complement of four torpedoes . She was also equipped with a 75 mm / 26 ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) deck gun and an 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun . 
 After intricate political negotiations to allocate production of the class between Austrian and Hungarian firms , U @-@ 27 was ordered from Cantiere Navale Triestino ( CNT ) on 12 October 1915 . She was laid down by early 1916 at the Pola Navy Yard , and launched on 19 October . 
 = = Service career = = 
 After her completion , U @-@ 27 was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy on 24 February 1917 under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant Robert <unk> von Fernland . Previously in command of U @-@ 11 , von Fernland was 31 @-@ year @-@ old native of Vienna . In April , von Fernland and U @-@ 27 both achieved their first kills . On 12 April , U @-@ 27 encountered the 3 @,@ 756 @-@ ton Greek steamship <unk> sailing from Genoa for Port Said . About 5 nautical miles ( 9 @.@ 3 km ; 5 @.@ 8 mi ) off Augusta , Sicily , U @-@ 27 shelled and sank the 11 @-@ year @-@ old Greek ship . Four days later , von Fernland torpedoed another Greek steamer , the 2 @,@ 976 @-@ ton <unk> . Carrying coal from Barry for Taranto , <unk> was sent to the bottom 5 nautical miles ( 9 @.@ 3 km ) from Cape Rizzuto . 
 In mid @-@ May 1917 , U @-@ 27 participated in a support role in a raid on the Otranto Barrage that precipitated the Battle of Otranto Straits . On the night of 14 / 15 May , the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruisers Helgoland , Saida , and Novara attacked the drifters that deployed the anti @-@ submarine nets that formed part of the Barrage , sinking 14 , damaging 5 , and taking 72 prisoners . Destroyers Csepel and Balaton were sent to simultaneously attack Italian transports shuttling between Italy and Valona , and sank an Italian destroyer and a munitions ship . U @-@ 27 , which was assigned to patrol between Brindisi and Cattaro , was a part of a force of three U @-@ boats intended to intercept British and Italian ships responding to the attacks ; the other two were the Austro @-@ Hungarian U @-@ 4 ( which was posted near Valona ) and the German UC @-@ 25 ( assigned to mine Brindisi ) . A squadron of British cruisers and Italian and French destroyers joined the battle against the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruisers on 15 May . Several ships on each side were damaged by the time the engagement was broken off . As a result of the attacks the drifter line of the Barrage was moved farther south and maintained only during the day , a success for the Central Powers . U @-@ 27 did not take any offensive action during the raid and ensuing battle . 
 On 9 June , U @-@ 27 sank Roland , a French sailing ship , off the Greek island of Cerigo . Two days later , von Fernland torpedoed the Japanese destroyer Sakaki between <unk> and Meles . Sakaki was one of eight Kaba @-@ class destroyers that were part of the Japanese contribution to the Allied effort in the Mediterranean . Although the Japanese ships often performed escort service for British troop convoys , <unk> does not report whether Sakaki was engaged in that duty when she was attacked . Even though 68 Japanese sailors perished in the attack , nearly two @-@ thirds the complement of a typical Kaba class ship , Sakaki remained afloat , was repaired , and remained in service . On 29 December , Linienschiffsleutnant Josef Holub replaced von Fernland as commander of U @-@ 27 . Holub , a 32 @-@ year @-@ old native of Galicia , had previously been in command of U @-@ 21 and U @-@ 22 . Holub recorded his first victory with U @-@ 27 in January 1918 . While near Marca , Sirocco , the U @-@ boat torpedoed and sank the Italian steamer Andrea Costa on 22 January . The 3 @,@ 991 @-@ ton Andrea Costa had sailed from Rangoon , but was sunk just short of her destination of Malta . A little more than four months would pass before Holub and U @-@ 27 would score their next success . 
 From late April to early May , U @-@ 27 sank six small ships — five Greek and one Italian — including three on one day , 6 May . All of the ships with reported tonnages were under 50 tons . U @-@ 27 torpedoed the British destroyer Phoenix at 09 : 18 on 14 May with the loss of one stoker and one artificer . Phoenix had been attached to the group of ships patrolling the Otranto Barrage when she was torpedoed amidships on the starboard side . Although she survived the initial attack , Phoenix was listing badly and taking on large quantities of water . An attempt was made by Australian destroyer Warrego to tow Phoenix to safety but by 12 : 45 she was in danger of capsizing and her crew were removed . Phoenix eventually sank at 13 : 10 in position 40 ° 23 ′ 30 ″ N 19 ° 14 ′ 00 ″ E. From 3 to 11 July , U @-@ 27 sank another ten ships , the largest reported being the 67 @-@ ton sailing vessel <unk> Padre . U @-@ 27 dispatched three of the ships on 3 July , and sank two each on 10 and 11 July . On 13 August , U @-@ 27 attacked the 2 @,@ 209 @-@ ton British steamer Anhui . The 15 @-@ year @-@ old ship was en route from Famagusta to Port Said , when U @-@ 27 torpedoed her 2 nautical miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) off Crete . Four persons on Anhui died when the ship with her general cargo went down . 
 U @-@ 27 's next victims were all encountered in mid @-@ September . On 11 September , the French sailing ship Antoinette was seized as a prize and towed into the port of Beyrouth . Starting three days later , Holub and U @-@ 27 sent an additional ten small ships to the bottom , including the final six all on 20 September . Except for the two largest ships — the 113 @-@ ton Agios Nicolas and the 103 @-@ ton <unk> — none were over 60 tons . 
 At the war 's end , U @-@ 27 was in port at Pola . The U @-@ boat was surrendered to Italy as a war reparation in 1919 and was scrapped at Fiume in 1920 . In addition to the sinking and damaging of two destroyers , she sank or captured 34 merchant ships totaling 14 @,@ 386 GRT .

 The Gateway of India is a monument built during the 20th century in Mumbai City of Maharashtra state in Western India . It is located on the waterfront in the Apollo Bunder area in South Mumbai and overlooks the Arabian Sea . The structure is a basalt arch , 26 metres ( 85 feet ) high . It lies at the end of Chhatrapati Shivaji Marg at the water 's edge in Mumbai Harbour . It was a crude jetty used by the fishing community which was later renovated and used as a landing place for British governors and other prominent people . In earlier times , it would have been the first structure that visitors arriving by boat in Mumbai would have seen . The Gateway has also been referred to as the Taj Mahal of Mumbai , and is the city 's top tourist attraction . The India Gate in New Delhi is similar to the Gateway of India in Mumbai . The structure was erected to commemorate the landing of King George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder , when they visited India in 1911 . Built in Indo @-@ Saracenic style , the foundation stone for the Gateway of India was laid on 31 March 1911 . The final design of George Wittet was sanctioned in 1914 and the construction of the monument was completed in 1924 . The Gateway was later the ceremonial entrance to India for <unk> and the new Governors of Bombay . It served to allow entry and access to India . 
 The monument has witnessed three terror attacks from the beginning of the 21st century ; twice in 2003 and it was also the disembarkation point in 2008 when four gunmen attacked the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower .

 The Gateway of India was built to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to Mumbai , prior to the Delhi Durbar , in December 1911 . However , they only got to see a cardboard model of the structure since the construction did not begin till 1915 . The foundation stone was laid on March 31 , 1911 , by the governor of Bombay Sir George Sydenham Clarke , with the final design of George Wittet sanctioned on March 31 , 1914 . The gateway was built from yellow basalt and concrete . Between 1915 and 1919 , work proceeded at Apollo <unk> ( Port ) to reclaim the land on which the gateway and the new sea wall would be built . The foundations were completed in 1920 , and construction was finished in 1924 . The gateway was opened on December 4 , 1924 , by the Viceroy , the Earl of Reading . 
 The last British troops to leave India following the country 's independence , the First Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry , passed through the Gateway on their way out in a ceremony on February 28 , 1948 , signalling the end of British rule . 
 = = Design and structure = = 
 The Scottish architect George Wittet combined the elements of the Roman triumphal arch and the 16th @-@ century architecture of Gujarat . Its design is a combination of Hindu and Muslim architectural styles ; the arch is of Muslim style while the decorations are of Hindu style . The gateway is built from yellow basalt and reinforced concrete . The stone was locally obtained , and the perforated screens were brought from Gwalior . The gateway faces out to Mumbai Harbour from the tip of Apollo Bunder . 
 The central dome is 48 feet ( 15 metres ) in diameter and 83 feet ( 25 metres ) above the ground at its highest point . The whole harbour front was realigned in order to come in line with a planned esplanade which would sweep down to the centre of the town . On each side of the arch , there are large halls that can hold 600 people . The cost of the construction was ₹ 2 million ( US $ 30 @,@ 000 ) , borne mainly by the Imperial Government of India . Due to a paucity of funds , the approach road was never built , and so the gateway stands at an angle to the road leading up to it . 
 = = Significance = = 
 It is the place where the viceroys and governors used to land upon their arrival in India . Though built as a welcome to King George V for his visit of 1911 , then an event of grand significance for British India and the British empire , today serves as a " monumental memento " of British colonial rule over India . Built right next to the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower hotel , for British arriving for the first time to India , the gateway was a symbol of the " power and majesty " of the British empire . 
 Opposite the gateway stands the statue of Shivaji , the king who used guerilla warfare to establish the Maratha empire in the Sahyadri mountain range in the 17th century , as a symbol of Maratha " pride and courage " . The statue was unveiled on 26 January 1961 on the occasion of India 's Republic Day . The other statue in the area is that of Swami Vivekananda , by renowned sculptor Sitaram S. Arte . 
 There are five jetties at the gateway . The first jetty is exclusive to the Atomic Research Centre , the second and third are used for commercial ferry operations , the fourth is closed and the fifth is exclusive to the Royal Bombay Yacht Club . 
 After the 2008 Mumbai attacks , there has been a proposal to close all these jetties and replace them with two newer ones to be built near the Bombay Presidency Radio Club nearby . The second and third jetties are the starting point for tours of Elephanta Caves , which is a 50 @-@ minute boat ride away by ferry . Other routes from the Gateway include ferry rides to <unk> and Mandwa ; these ferries are said to carry passengers above their certified capacity due to their popularity . 
 The Gateway of India is a major tourist destination and a popular gathering spot for locals , street vendors and photographers . In 2012 , Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation moved the " Elephanta Festival of music and dance " from its original location at Elephanta Caves ( where it had been celebrated for 23 years ) to the Gateway due to the increased capacity offered by the venue . The Gateway can host 2 @,@ 000 to 2 @,@ 500 people , whereas Elephanta Caves could host only 700 to 800 people . 
 A bomb planted in a taxi exploded near the gateway in the 2003 . The gateway was also the site of a major bomb @-@ blast in August 2003 and was the disembarkation point of the terrorists participating in the November 2008 terror attacks when four gunmen attacked the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower . Public movement in certain areas was restricted after the 2008 attacks . 
 = Henry III of England = 
 Henry III ( 1 October 1207 – 16 November 1272 ) , also known as Henry of Winchester , was King of England , Lord of Ireland and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death . The son of King John and Isabella of Angoulême , Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the First Barons ' War . Cardinal Guala declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry 's forces , led by William Marshal , defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217 . Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225 , which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons . His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches , who re @-@ established royal authority after the war . In 1230 the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father , but the invasion was a debacle . A revolt led by William Marshal 's son , Richard , broke out in 1232 , ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church . 
 Following the revolt , Henry ruled England personally , rather than governing through senior ministers . He travelled less than previous monarchs , investing heavily in a handful of his favourite palaces and castles . He married Eleanor of Provence , with whom he had five children . Henry was known for his piety , holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities ; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of Edward the Confessor , whom he adopted as his patron saint . He extracted huge sums of money from the Jews in England , ultimately crippling their ability to do business , and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened , he introduced the Statute of Jewry , attempting to segregate the community . In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family 's lands in France , he invaded Poitou in 1242 , leading to the disastrous Battle of Taillebourg . After this , Henry relied on diplomacy , cultivating an alliance with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II . Henry supported his brother Richard in his bid to become King of the Romans in 1256 , but was unable to place his own son Edmund on the throne of Sicily , despite investing large amounts of money . He planned to go on crusade to the Levant , but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in Gascony . 
 By 1258 , Henry 's rule was increasingly unpopular , the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his Poitevin half @-@ brothers , the Lusignans , as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts . A coalition of his barons , initially probably backed by Eleanor , seized power in a coup d 'état and expelled the Poitevins from England , reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford . Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259 , under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX of France recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony . The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued . 
 In 1263 one of the more radical barons , Simon de Montfort , seized power , resulting in the Second Barons ' War . Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army . The Battle of Lewes occurred in 1264 , where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner . Henry 's eldest son , Edward , escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham the following year and freed his father . Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels , but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the Dictum of Kenilworth . Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures , including further suppression of the Jews , to maintain baronial and popular support . Henry died in 1272 , leaving Edward as his successor . He was buried in Westminster Abbey , which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign , and was moved to his current tomb in 1290 . Some miracles were declared after his death but he was not canonised . 
 = = Background and childhood = = 
 Henry was born in Winchester Castle on 1 October 1207 . He was the eldest son of King John and Isabella of Angoulême . Little is known of Henry 's early life . He was initially looked after by a wet nurse called Ellen in the south of England , away from John 's itinerant court , and probably had close ties to his mother . Henry had four legitimate younger brothers and sisters – Richard , Joan , Isabella and Eleanor – and various older illegitimate siblings . In 1212 his education was entrusted to Peter des Roches , the Bishop of Winchester ; under his direction , Henry was given military training by Philip D 'Aubigny and taught to ride , probably by Ralph of St Samson . 
 Little is known about Henry 's appearance ; he was probably around 168 centimetres ( 66 in ) tall , and accounts recorded after his death suggested that he had a strong build , with a drooping eyelid . Henry grew up to occasionally show flashes of a fierce temper , but mostly , as historian David Carpenter describes , he had an " amiable , easy @-@ going , and sympathetic " personality . He was unaffected and honest , and showed his emotions readily , easily being moved to tears by religious sermons . 
 At the start of the 13th century , the Kingdom of England formed part of an empire spreading across Western Europe . Henry was named after his grandfather , Henry II , who had built up this vast network of lands stretching from Scotland and Wales , through England , across the English Channel to the territories of Normandy , Brittany , Maine and Anjou in north @-@ west France , onto Poitou and Gascony in the south @-@ west . For many years the French Crown was relatively weak , enabling first Henry II , and then his sons Richard and John , to dominate France . 
 In 1204 , John lost Normandy , Brittany , Maine and Anjou to Philip II of France , leaving English power on the continent limited to Gascony and Poitou . John raised taxes to pay for military campaigns to regain his lands , but unrest grew among many of the English barons ; John sought new allies by declaring England a Papal fiefdom , owing allegiance to the Pope . In 1215 , John and the rebel barons negotiated a potential peace treaty , the Magna Carta . The treaty would have limited potential abuses of royal power , demobilised the rebel armies and set up a power @-@ sharing arrangement , but in practice neither side complied with its conditions . John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the Magna Carta and the First Barons ' War erupted , with the rebel barons aided by Philip 's son , the future Louis VIII , who claimed the English throne for himself . The war soon settled into a stalemate , with neither side able to claim victory . The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October , leaving the nine @-@ year @-@ old Henry as his heir .

 = = = Coronation = = = 
 Henry was staying safely at Corfe Castle in Dorset with his mother when King John died . On his deathbed , John appointed a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom , and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of William Marshal , one of the most famous knights in England . The loyalist leaders decided to crown Henry immediately to reinforce his claim to the throne . William knighted the boy , and Cardinal Guala Bicchieri , the papal legate to England , then oversaw his coronation at Gloucester Cathedral on 28 October . In the absence of the archbishops of Canterbury or York , he was anointed by the bishops of Worcester and Exeter , and crowned by Peter des Roches . The royal crown had been either lost or sold during the civil war , so instead the ceremony used a simple gold corolla belonging to Queen Isabella . 
 The young King inherited a difficult situation , with over half of England occupied by the rebels and most of his father 's continental possessions still in French hands . He had substantial support , however , from Guala who intended to win the civil war for Henry and punish the rebels . Guala set about strengthening the ties between England and the Papacy , starting with the coronation itself , where Henry gave homage to the Papacy , recognising the Pope as his feudal lord . Pope Honorius declared that Henry was the Pope 's vassal and ward , and that the legate had complete authority to protect Henry and his kingdom . As an additional measure , Henry took the cross , declaring himself a crusader and so entitled to special protection from Rome . 
 Two senior nobles stood out as candidates to head Henry 's regency government . The first was William , who , although elderly , was renowned for his personal loyalty and could help support the war with his own men and material . The second was Ranulf de Blondeville , the Earl of Chester and one of the most powerful loyalist barons . William diplomatically waited until both Guala and Ranulf had requested him to take up the post before assuming power . William then appointed des Roches to be Henry 's guardian , freeing himself up to lead the military effort . 
 = = = End of the Barons ' War = = = 
 The war was not going well for the loyalists and the new regency government considered retreating to Ireland . Prince Louis and the rebel barons , however , were also finding it difficult to make further progress . Despite Louis controlling Westminster Abbey , he could not be crowned king because the English Church and the Papacy backed Henry . John 's death had defused some of the rebel concerns , and the royal castles were still holding out in the occupied parts of the country . In a bid to take advantage of this , Henry encouraged the rebel barons to come back to his cause in exchange for the return of their lands , and reissued a version of the Magna Carta , albeit having first removed some of the clauses , including those unfavourable to the Papacy . The move was not successful and opposition to Henry 's new government hardened . 
 In February , Louis set sail for France to gather reinforcements . In his absence , arguments broke out between Louis 's French and English followers , and Cardinal Guala declared that Henry 's war against the rebels was a religious crusade . This resulted in a series of defections from the rebel movement , and the tide of the conflict swung in Henry 's favour . Louis returned at the end of April and reinvigorated his campaign , splitting his forces into two groups , sending one north to besiege Lincoln Castle and keeping one in the south to capture Dover Castle . When he learnt that Louis had divided his army , William Marshal gambled on defeating the rebels in a single battle . William marched north and attacked Lincoln on 20 May ; entering through a side gate , he took the city in a sequence of fierce street battles and sacked the buildings . Large numbers of senior rebels were captured , and historian David Carpenter considers the battle to be " one of the most decisive in English history " . 
 In the aftermath of Lincoln , the loyalist campaign stalled and only recommenced in late June when the victors had arranged the ransoming of their prisoners . Meanwhile , support for Louis 's campaign was diminishing in France and he concluded that the war in England was lost . The French prince negotiated terms with Cardinal Guala , under which he would renounce his claim to the English throne ; in return , his followers would be given back their lands , any sentences of excommunication would be lifted and Henry 's government would promise to enforce the Magna Carta . The proposed agreement soon began to unravel amid claims from some loyalists that it was too generous towards the rebels , particularly the clergy who had joined the rebellion . In the absence of a settlement , Louis remained in London with his remaining forces . 
 On 24 August 1217 , a French fleet arrived off the coast of Sandwich , bringing Louis soldiers , siege engines and fresh supplies . Hubert de Burgh , Henry 's justiciar , set sail to intercept it , resulting in the Battle of Sandwich . De Burgh 's fleet scattered the French and captured their flagship , commanded by Eustace the Monk , who was promptly executed . When the news reached Louis , he entered into fresh peace negotiations . Henry , Isabella , Louis , Guala and William came to agreement on the final Treaty of Lambeth , also known as the Treaty of Kingston , on the 12 and 13 September . The treaty was similar to the first peace offer , but excluded the rebel clergy , whose lands and appointments remained forfeit . Louis accepted a gift of £ 6 @,@ 666 to speed his departure from England , and promised to try to persuade King Philip to return Henry 's lands in France . Louis left England as agreed and joined the Albigensian Crusade in the south of France . 
 = = = Restoring royal authority = = = 
 With the end of the civil war , Henry 's government faced the task of rebuilding royal authority across large parts of the country . By the end of 1217 many former rebels were routinely ignoring instructions from the centre , and even Henry 's loyalist supporters jealously maintained their independent control over royal castles . <unk> constructed fortifications , called adulterine castles , had sprung up across much of the country . The network of county sheriffs had collapsed , and with it the ability to raise taxes and collect royal revenues . The powerful Welsh Prince Llywelyn posed a major threat in Wales and along the Welsh Marches . 
 Despite his success in winning the war , William had far less success in restoring royal power following the peace . In part , this was because William was unable to offer significant patronage , despite the expectations from the loyalist barons that they would be rewarded . William attempted to enforce the traditional rights of the Crown to approve marriages and <unk> , but with little success . Nonetheless , William was able to reconstitute the royal bench of judges and reopen the royal exchequer . The government issued the Charter of the Forest , which attempted to reform the royal governance of the forests . The regency and Llywelyn came to agreement on the Treaty of Worcester in 1218 , but its generous terms – Llywelyn became effectively Henry 's justiciar across Wales – underlined the weakness of the English Crown . 
 Henry 's mother was unable to establish a role for herself in the regency government and she returned to France in 1217 , marrying Hugh de Lusignan , a powerful Poitevin noble . William Marshal fell ill and died in April 1219 . The replacement government was formed around a grouping of three senior ministers : Pandulf , the replacement Papal legate ; Peter des Roches ; and Hubert de Burgh , a former justiciar . The three were appointed by a great council of the nobility at Oxford , and their government came to depend on these councils for authority . Hubert and des Roches were political rivals , with Hubert supported by a network of English barons , and des Roches backed by nobles from the royal territories in Poitou and Touraine . Hubert moved decisively against des Roches in 1221 , accusing him of treason and removing him as the King 's guardian ; the Bishop left England for the crusades . Pandulf was recalled by Rome the same year , leaving Hubert as the dominant force in Henry 's government . 
 Initially the new government had little success , but in 1220 the fortunes of Henry 's government began to improve . The Pope allowed Henry to be crowned for a second time , using a new set of royal regalia . The fresh coronation was intended to affirm the authority of the King ; Henry promised to restore the powers of the Crown , and the barons swore that they would give back the royal castles and pay their debts to the Crown , on the threat of excommunication . Hubert , accompanied by Henry , moved into Wales to suppress Llywelyn in 1223 , and in England his forces steadily reclaimed Henry 's castles . The effort against the remaining recalcitrant barons came to a head in 1224 with the siege of Bedford Castle , which Henry and Hubert besieged for eight weeks ; when it finally fell , almost all of the garrison were executed . 
 Meanwhile , Louis VIII of France allied himself with Hugh de Lusignan and invaded first Poitou and then Gascony . Henry 's army in Poitou was under @-@ resourced and lacked support from the Poitevin barons , many of whom had felt abandoned during the years of Henry 's minority ; as a result , the province quickly fell . It became clear that Gascony would also fall unless reinforcements were sent from England . In early 1225 a great council approved a tax of £ 40 @,@ 000 to dispatch an army , which quickly retook Gascony . In exchange for agreeing to support Henry , the barons demanded that the King reissue the Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest . This time the King declared that the charters were issued of his own " spontaneous and free will " and confirmed them with the royal seal , giving the new Great Charter and the Charter of the Forest of 1225 much more authority than any previous versions . The barons anticipated that the King would act in accordance with these definitive charters , subject to the law and moderated by the advice of the nobility . 
 = = Early rule ( 1227 – 34 ) = = 
 = = = Invasion of France = = = 
 Henry assumed formal control of his government in January 1227 , although some contemporaries argued that he was legally still a minor until his 21st birthday the following year . The King richly rewarded Hubert de Burgh for his service during his minority years , making him the Earl of Kent and giving him extensive lands across England and Wales . Despite coming of age , Henry remained heavily influenced by his advisers for the first few years of his rule and retained Hubert as his justiciar to run the government , granting him the position for life . 
 The fate of Henry 's family lands in France still remained uncertain . Reclaiming these lands was extremely important to Henry , who used terms such as " reclaiming his inheritance " , " restoring his rights " and " defending his legal claims " to the territories in diplomatic correspondence . The French kings , however , had an increasing financial , and thus military , advantage over Henry . Even under John , the French Crown had enjoyed a considerable , although not overwhelming , advantage in resources , but since then , the balance had shifted further , with the ordinary annual income of the French kings almost doubling between 1204 and 1221 . 
 Louis VIII died in 1226 , leaving his 12 @-@ year @-@ old son , Louis IX , to inherit the throne , supported by a regency government . The young French King was in a much weaker position than his father , and faced opposition from many of the French nobility who still maintained their ties to England , leading to a sequence of revolts across the country . Against this background , in late 1228 a group of potential Norman and Angevin rebels called upon Henry to invade and reclaim his inheritance , and Peter de Dreux , the Duke of Brittany , openly revolted against Louis and gave his homage to Henry . 
 Henry 's preparations for an invasion progressed slowly , and when he finally arrived in Brittany with an army in May 1230 , the campaign did not go well . Possibly on the advice of Hubert , the King decided to avoid battle with the French by not invading Normandy and instead marching south into Poitou , where he campaigned ineffectually over the summer , before finally progressing safely onto Gascony . He made a truce with Louis until 1234 and returned to England having achieved nothing ; historian Huw Ridgeway describes the expedition as a " costly fiasco " . 
 = = = Richard Marshal 's revolt = = = 
 Henry 's chief minister , Hubert de Burgh fell from power in 1232 . His old rival , Peter des Roches , returned to England from the crusades in August 1231 , and allied himself with Hubert 's growing number of political opponents . He put the case to Henry that the Justiciar had squandered royal money and lands , and was responsible for a series of riots against foreign clerics . Hubert took sanctuary in Merton College Chapel , but Henry had him arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London . Des Roches took over the King 's government , backed by the Poitevin baronial faction in England , who saw this as a chance to take back the lands which they had lost to Hubert 's followers in the previous decades . 
 Des Roches used his new authority to begin stripping his opponents of their estates , circumventing the courts and legal process . Complaints from powerful barons such as William Marshal 's son Richard grew , and they argued that Henry was failing to protect their legal rights as described in the 1225 charters . A fresh civil war broke out between des Roches and Richard 's followers . Des Roches sent armies into Richard 's lands in Ireland and South Wales . In response , Richard allied himself with Prince Llywelyn , and his own supporters rose up in rebellion in England . Henry was unable to gain a clear military advantage and became concerned that Louis of France might seize the opportunity to invade Brittany – where the truce was about to expire – while he was distracted at home . 
 Edmund Rich , the Archbishop of Canterbury , intervened in 1234 and held several great councils , advising Henry to accept the dismissal of des Roches . Henry agreed to make peace , but , before the negotiations were completed , Richard died of wounds suffered in battle , leaving his younger brother Gilbert to inherit his lands . The final settlement was confirmed in May , and Henry was widely praised for his humility in submitting to the slightly embarrassing peace . Meanwhile , the truce with France in Brittany finally expired , and Henry 's ally Duke Peter came under fresh military pressure . Henry could only send a small force of soldiers to assist , and Brittany fell to Louis in November . For the next 24 years , Henry ruled the kingdom personally , rather than through senior ministers . 
 = = Henry as king = = 
 = = = Kingship , government and law = = = 
 Royal government in England had traditionally centred on several great offices of state , filled by powerful , independent members of the baronage . Henry abandoned this policy , leaving the post of justiciar vacant and turning the position of chancellor into a more junior role . A small royal council was formed but its role was ill @-@ defined ; appointments , patronage and policy were decided personally by Henry and his immediate advisers , rather than through the larger councils that had marked his early years . The changes made it much harder for those outside Henry 's inner circle to influence policy or to pursue legitimate grievances , particularly against the King 's friends . 
 Henry believed that kings should rule England in a dignified manner , surrounded by ceremony and ecclesiastical ritual . He thought that his predecessors had allowed the status of the Crown to decline , and sought to correct this during his reign . The events of the civil war in Henry 's youth deeply affected the King , and he adopted Edward the Confessor as his patron saint , hoping to emulate the way in which the Anglo @-@ Saxon King had brought peace to England and reunited his people in order and harmony . Henry tried to use his royal authority leniently , hoping to appease the more hostile barons and maintain peace in England . 
 As a result , despite a symbolic emphasis on royal power , Henry 's rule was relatively circumscribed and constitutional . He generally acted within the terms of the charters , which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons , including the fines and expropriations that had been common under John . The charters , however , did not address the sensitive issues of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution of patronage , and they lacked any means of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them . Henry 's rule became lax and careless , resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and , ultimately , the collapse of his authority at court . The inconsistency with which he applied the charters over the course of his rule alienated many barons , even those within his own faction . 
 The term " parliament " first appeared in the 1230s and 1240s to describe large gatherings of the royal court , and parliamentary gatherings were held periodically throughout Henry 's reign . They were used to agree the raising of taxes which , in the 13th century , were single , one @-@ off levies , typically on movable property , intended to support the King 's normal revenues for particular projects . During Henry 's reign , the counties began to send regular delegations to these parliaments , and came to represent a broader cross @-@ section of the community than simply the major barons . 
 Despite the various charters , the provision of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics : sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint , on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored . The royal eyres , courts which toured the country to provide justice at the local level , typically for those lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against the major lords , had little power , allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system . The power of royal sheriffs also declined during Henry 's reign . They were now often lesser men appointed by the exchequer , rather than coming from important local families , and they focused on generating revenue for the King . Their robust attempts to enforce fines and collect debts generated much unpopularity among the lower classes . Unlike his father , Henry did not exploit the large debts that the barons frequently owed to the Crown , and was slow to collect any sums of money due to him . 
 = = = Court = = = 
 The royal court was formed round Henry 's trusted friends , such as Richard de Clare , the brothers Hugh and Roger Bigod and Humphrey de Bohun and Henry 's brother , Richard . Henry wanted to use his court to unite his English and continental subjects , and it included Simon de Montfort , originally a French knight who had married Henry 's sister Eleanor and become the Earl of Leicester , in addition to the later influxes of Henry 's Savoyard and Lusignan relatives . The court followed European styles and traditions , and was heavily influenced by Henry 's Angevin family traditions : French was the spoken language , it had close links to the royal courts of France , Castile , the Holy Roman Empire and Sicily , and Henry sponsored the same writers as the other European rulers . 
 Henry travelled less than previous kings , seeking a tranquil , more sedate life and staying at each of his palaces for prolonged periods before moving on . Possibly as a result , he focused more attention on his palaces and houses ; Henry was , according to architectural historian John Goodall , " the most obsessive patron of art and architecture ever to have occupied the throne of England " . Henry extended the royal complex at Westminster in London , one of his favourite homes , rebuilding the palace and the abbey at a cost of almost £ 55 @,@ 000 . He spent more time in Westminster than any of his predecessors , shaping the formation of England 's capital city . 
 He spent £ 58 @,@ 000 on his royal castles , carrying out major works at the Tower of London , Lincoln and Dover . Both the military defences and the internal accommodation of these castles were significantly improved . At Windsor , a huge overhaul of the castle produced a lavish palace complex , whose style and detail inspired many subsequent designs in England and Wales . The Tower of London was extended to form a concentric fortress with extensive living quarters , although Henry primarily used the castle as a secure retreat in the event of war or civil strife . Henry also kept a menagerie at the Tower , a tradition begun by his father , and his exotic specimens included an elephant , a leopard and a camel . 
 Henry reformed the system of silver coins in England in 1247 , replacing the older Short Cross silver pennies with a new Long Cross design . Due to the initial costs of the transition , Henry required the financial help of his brother Richard to undertake this reform , but the recoinage occurred quickly and efficiently . Between 1243 and 1258 , the King assembled two great hoards , or stockpiles , of gold . In 1257 , Henry needed to spend the second of these hoards urgently and , rather than selling the gold quickly and depressing its value , Henry decided to introduce gold pennies into England , following the popular trend in Italy . The gold pennies resembled the gold coins issued by Edward the Confessor , but the overvalued currency attracted complaints from the City of London and was ultimately abandoned . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Henry was known for his public demonstrations of piety , and appears to have been genuinely devout . He promoted rich , luxurious Church services , and , unusually for the period , attended mass at least once a day . He gave generously to religious causes , paid for the feeding of 500 paupers each day and helped orphans . He fasted before commemorating Edward the Confessor 's feasts , and may have washed the feet of lepers . Henry regularly went on pilgrimages , particularly to the abbeys of <unk> , St Albans and Walsingham Priory , although he appears to have sometimes used pilgrimages as an excuse to avoid dealing with pressing political problems . 
 Henry shared many of his religious views with Louis of France , and the two men appear to have been slightly competitive in their piety . Towards the end of his reign , Henry may have taken up the practice of curing sufferers of scrofula , often called " the King 's evil " , by touching them , possibly emulating Louis , who also took up the practice . Louis had a famous collection of Passion Relics which he stored at Sainte @-@ Chapelle , and paraded the Holy Cross through Paris in 1241 ; Henry took possession of the relic of the Holy Blood in 1247 , marching it through Westminster to be installed in Westminster Abbey , which he promoted as an alternative to the Sainte @-@ Chapelle . 
 Henry was particularly supportive of the mendicant orders ; his confessors were drawn from the Dominican Friars , and he built mendicant houses in Canterbury , Norwich , Oxford , Reading and York , helping to find valuable space for new buildings in what were already crowded towns and cities . He supported the military crusading orders , and became a patron of the Teutonic Order in 1235 . The emerging universities of Oxford and Cambridge also received royal attention : Henry reinforced and regulated their powers , and encouraged scholars to migrate from Paris to teach at them . A rival institution at Northampton was declared by the King to be a mere school and not a true university . 
 The support given to Henry by the Papacy during his early years had a lasting influence on his attitude towards Rome , and he defended the mother church diligently throughout his reign . Rome in the 13th century was at once both the centre of the Europe @-@ wide Church , and a political power in central Italy , threatened militarily by the Holy Roman Empire . During Henry 's reign , the Papacy developed a strong , central bureaucracy , supported by benefices granted to absent churchmen working in Rome . Tensions grew between this practice and the needs of local parishioners , exemplified by the dispute between Robert Grosseteste , the Bishop of Lincoln , and the Papacy in 1250 . Although the Scottish Church became more independent of England during the period , the Papal <unk> helped Henry continue to apply influence over its activities at a distance . Pope Innocent IV 's attempts to raise funds began to face opposition from within the English Church during Henry 's reign . In 1240 , the Papal emissary 's collection of taxes to pay for the Papacy 's war with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II resulted in protests , ultimately overcome with the help of Henry and the Pope , and in the 1250s Henry 's crusading tithes faced similar resistance . 
 = = = Jewish policies = = = 
 The Jews of England were considered the property of the Crown , and they had traditionally been used as a source of cheap loans and easy taxation , in exchange for royal protection against antisemitism . The Jews had suffered considerable oppression during the First Barons ' War , but during Henry 's early years the community had flourished and became one of the most prosperous in Europe . This was primarily the result of the stance taken by the regency government , which took a range of measures to protect the Jews and encourage lending . This was driven by financial self @-@ interest , as they stood to profit considerably from a strong Jewish community in England . Their policy ran counter to the instructions being sent from the Pope , however , who had laid out strong anti @-@ Jewish measures at the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 ; William Marshal continued with his policy despite complaints from the Church . 
 In 1239 Henry introduced different policies , possibly trying to imitate those of Louis of France : Jewish leaders across England were imprisoned and forced to pay fines equivalent to a third of their goods , and any outstanding loans were to be released . Further huge demands for cash followed – £ 40 @,@ 000 was demanded in 1244 , for example , of which around two @-@ thirds was collected within five years – destroying the ability of the Jewish community to lend money commercially . Henry had built the Domus <unk> in London in 1232 to help convert Jews to Christianity , and efforts intensified after 1239 ; as many as 10 percent of the Jews in England had been converted by the late 1250s . Anti @-@ Jewish stories involving tales of child sacrifice flourished in the 1250s and , in response , Henry passed the Statute of Jewry in 1253 , which attempted to segregate Jews and enforce the wearing of Jewish badges ; it remains unclear to what extent this statute was actually implemented by Henry . 
 = = Personal rule ( 1234 – 58 ) = = 
 = = = Marriage = = = 
 Henry investigated a range of potential marriage partners in his youth , but they all proved unsuitable for reasons of European and domestic politics . In 1236 he finally married Eleanor of Provence , the daughter of Raymond @-@ Berengar , the Count of Provence , and Beatrice of Savoy . Eleanor was well @-@ mannered , cultured and articulate , but the primary reason for the marriage was political , as Henry stood to create a valuable set of alliances with the rulers of the south and south @-@ east of France . Over the coming years , Eleanor emerged as a hard @-@ headed , firm politician . Historians Margaret Howell and David Carpenter describe her as being " more combative " and " far tougher and more determined " than her husband . 
 The marriage contract was confirmed in 1235 and Eleanor travelled to England to meet Henry for the first time . The pair were married at Canterbury Cathedral in January 1236 , and Eleanor was crowned queen at Westminster shortly afterwards in a lavish ceremony planned by Henry . There was a substantial age gap between the couple – Henry was 28 , Eleanor only 12 – but historian Margaret Howell observes that the King " was generous and warm @-@ hearted and prepared to lavish care and affection on his wife " . Henry gave Eleanor extensive gifts and paid personal attention to establishing and equipping her household . He also brought her fully into his religious life , including involving her in his devotion to Edward the Confessor . 
 Despite initial concerns that the Queen might be barren , Henry and Eleanor had five children together . In 1239 Eleanor gave birth to their first child , Edward , named after the Confessor . Henry was overjoyed and held huge celebrations , giving lavishly to the Church and to the poor to encourage God to protect his young son . Their first daughter , Margaret , named after Eleanor 's sister , followed in 1240 , her birth also accompanied by celebrations and donations to the poor . Henry 's third child , Beatrice , was named after his mother @-@ in @-@ law , and born in 1242 during a campaign in Poitou . Their fourth child , Edmund , arrived in 1245 and was named after the 9th @-@ century saint : concerned about Eleanor 's health , Henry donated large amounts of money to the Church throughout the pregnancy . A third daughter , Katherine , was born in 1253 but soon fell ill , possibly the result of a degenerative disorder such as Rett syndrome , and was unable to speak . She died in 1257 and Henry was distraught . Henry 's children spent most of their childhood at Windsor Castle and he appears to have been extremely attached to them , rarely spending extended periods of time apart from his family . 
 After Eleanor 's marriage , many of her Savoyard relatives joined her in England . At least 170 Savoyards arrived in England after 1236 , coming from Savoy , Burgundy and Flanders , including Eleanor 's uncles : Boniface became the Archbishop of Canterbury , and William became Henry 's chief adviser for a short period . Henry arranged marriages for many of them into the English nobility , a practice that initially caused friction with the English barons , who resisted landed estates passing into the hands of foreigners . The Savoyards were careful not to exacerbate the situation and became increasingly integrated into English baronial society , forming an important power base for Eleanor in England . 
 = = = Poitou and the Lusignans = = = 
 In 1241 , the barons in Poitou , including Henry 's step @-@ father Hugh de Lusignan , rebelled against the rule of Louis of France . The rebels had counted on aid from Henry , but he lacked domestic support and was slow to mobilise an army , not arriving in France until the next summer . Henry 's campaign was hesitant and was further undermined by Hugh switching sides and returning to support Louis . On 20 May Henry 's army was surrounded by the French at Taillebourg ; Henry 's brother Richard persuaded the French to delay their attack and the King took the opportunity to escape to Bordeaux . Simon de Montfort , who fought a successful rearguard action during the withdrawal , was furious with the King 's incompetence and told Henry that he should be locked up like the 10th @-@ century Carolingian king Charles the Simple . The Poitou rebellion collapsed and Henry entered into a fresh five @-@ year truce ; his campaign had been a disastrous failure and had cost over £ 80 @,@ 000 . 
 In the aftermath of the revolt , French power extended throughout Poitou , threatening the interests of the Lusignan family . In 1247 Henry encouraged his relatives to travel to England , where they were rewarded with large estates , largely at the expense of the English barons . More Poitevins followed , until around 100 had settled in England , around two @-@ thirds of them being granted substantial incomes worth £ 66 or more by Henry . Henry encouraged some to help him on the continent ; others acted as mercenaries and diplomatic agents , or fought on Henry 's behalf in European campaigns . Many were given estates along the contested Welsh Marches , or in Ireland , where they protected the frontiers . For Henry , the community was an important symbol of his hopes to one day reconquer Poitou and the rest of his French lands , and many of the Lusignans became close friends with his son Edward . 
 The presence of Henry 's extended family in England proved controversial . Concerns were raised by contemporary chroniclers – especially in works of Roger de Wendover and Matthew Paris – about the number of foreigners in England and historian Martin <unk> notes the xenophobic overtones of their commentary . The term " Poitevins " became loosely applied to this grouping , although many came from Anjou and other parts of France , and by the 1250s there was a fierce rivalry between the relatively well established Savoyards and the newly arrived Poitevins . The Lusignans began to break the law with impunity , pursuing personal grievances against other barons and the Savoyards , and Henry took little or no action to restrain them . By 1258 , the general dislike of the Poitevins had turned into hatred , with Simon de Montfort one of their strongest critics . 
 = = = Scotland , Wales and Ireland = = = 
 Henry 's position in Wales was strengthened during the first two decades of his personal rule . Following the death of Llywelyn the Great in 1240 , Henry 's power in Wales expanded . Three military campaigns were carried out in the 1240s , new castles were constructed and the royal lands in the County of Chester were expanded , increasing Henry 's dominance over the Welsh princes . Dafydd , Llywelyn 's son , resisted the incursions , but died in 1246 , and Henry confirmed the Treaty of Woodstock the following year with Owain and Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , Llywelyn the Great 's grandsons , under which they ceded land to the King but retained the heart of their princedom in Gwynedd . In South Wales , Henry gradually extended his authority across the region , but the campaigns were not pursued with vigour and the King did little to stop the Marcher territories along the border becoming increasingly independent of the Crown . In 1256 , however , Llywelyn ap Gruffudd rebelled against Henry and widespread violence spread across Wales ; Henry promised a swift military response but did not carry through on his threats . 
 Ireland was important to Henry , both as a source of royal revenue – an average of £ 1 @,@ 150 was sent from Ireland to the Crown each year during the middle of his reign – and as a source of estates that could be granted to his supporters . The major landowners looked eastwards towards Henry 's court for political leadership , and many also possessed estates in Wales and England . The 1240s saw major upheavals in land ownership due to deaths among the barons , enabling Henry to redistribute Irish lands to his supporters . In the 1250s , the King gave out numerous grants of land along the frontier in Ireland to his supporters , creating a buffer zone against the native Irish ; the local Irish kings began to suffer increased harassment as English power increased across the region . These lands were in many cases unprofitable for the barons to hold and English power reached its zenith under Henry for the medieval period . In 1254 , Henry granted Ireland to his son , Edward , on condition that it would never be separated from the Crown . 
 Henry maintained peace with Scotland during his reign , where he was the feudal lord of Alexander II . Henry assumed that he had the right to interfere in Scottish affairs and brought up the issue of his authority with the Scottish kings at key moments , but he lacked the inclination or the resources to do much more . Alexander had occupied parts of northern England during the First Barons ' War but had been excommunicated and forced to retreat . Alexander married Henry 's sister Joan in 1221 , and after he and Henry signed the Treaty of York in 1237 , Henry had a secure northern frontier . Henry knighted Alexander III before the young King married Henry 's daughter Margaret in 1251 and , despite Alexander 's refusal to give homage to Henry for Scotland , the two enjoyed a good relationship . Henry had Alexander and Margaret rescued from Edinburgh Castle when they were imprisoned there by a rebellious Scottish baron in 1255 and took additional measures to manage Alexander 's government during the rest of his minority years . 
 = = = European strategy = = = 
 Henry had no further opportunities to reconquer his possessions in France after the collapse of his military campaign at Taillebourg . Henry 's resources were quite inadequate in comparison to those of the French Crown , and by the end of the 1240s it was clear that King Louis had become the preeminent power across France . Henry instead adopted what historian Michael Clanchy has described as a " European strategy " , attempting to regain his lands in France through diplomacy rather than force , building alliances with other states prepared to put military pressure on the French King . In particular , Henry cultivated Frederick II , hoping he would turn against Louis or allow his nobility to join Henry 's campaigns . In the process , Henry 's attention became increasingly focused on European politics and events rather than domestic affairs . 
 Crusading was a popular cause in the 13th century , and in 1248 Louis joined the ill @-@ fated Seventh Crusade , having first made a fresh truce with England and received assurances from the Pope that he would protect his lands against any attack by Henry . Henry might have joined this crusade himself , but the rivalry between the two kings made this impossible and , after Louis 's defeat at the Battle of Al Mansurah in 1250 , Henry instead announced that he would be undertaking his own crusade to the Levant . The King began to make arrangements for passage with friendly rulers around the Levant , imposing efficiency savings on the royal household and arranging for ships and transport : he appeared almost over @-@ eager to take part . Henry 's plans reflected his strong religious beliefs , but they also stood to give him additional international credibility when arguing for the return of his possessions in France . 
 Henry 's crusade never departed , as he was forced to deal with problems in Gascony , where the harsh policies of the King 's lieutenant , Simon de Montfort , had provoked a violent uprising in 1252 , which was supported by King Alfonso X of neighbouring Castile . The English court was split over the problem : Simon and Eleanor argued that the Gascons were to blame for the crisis , while Henry , backed by the Lusignans , blamed Simon 's misjudgment . Henry and Eleanor quarrelled over the issue and were not reconciled until the following year . Forced to intervene personally , Henry carried out an effective , if expensive , campaign with the help of the Lusignans and stabilised the province . Alfonso signed a treaty of alliance in 1254 , and Gascony was given to Henry 's son Edward , who married Alfonso 's half @-@ sister Eleanor , delivering a long @-@ lasting peace with Castile . 
 On the way back from Gascony , Henry met with Louis for the first time in an arrangement brokered by their wives , and the two kings became close friends . The Gascon campaign cost more than £ 200 @,@ 000 and used up all the money intended for Henry 's crusade , leaving him heavily in debt and reliant on loans from his brother Richard and the Lusignans . 
 = = = The Sicilian business = = = 
 Henry did not give up on his hopes for a crusade , but became increasingly absorbed in a bid to acquire the wealthy Kingdom of Sicily for his son Edmund . Sicily had been controlled by Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire , for many years a rival of Pope Innocent IV . On Frederick 's death in 1250 , Innocent started to look for a new ruler , one more amenable to the Papacy . Henry saw Sicily as both a valuable prize for his son and as an excellent base for his crusading plans in the east . With minimal consultation within his court , Henry came to an agreement with the Pope in 1254 that Edmund should be the next king . Innocent urged Henry to send Edmund with an army to reclaim Sicily from Frederick 's son Manfred , offering to contribute to the expenses of the campaign . 
 Innocent was succeeded by Alexander IV , who was facing increasingly military pressure from the Empire . He could no longer afford to pay Henry 's expenses , instead demanding that Henry compensate the Papacy for the £ 90 @,@ 000 spent on the war so far . This was a huge sum , and Henry turned to parliament for help in 1255 , only to be rebuffed ; further attempts followed , but by 1257 only partial parliamentary assistance had been offered . Alexander grew increasingly unhappy about Henry 's prevarication and in 1258 sent an envoy to England , threatening to excommunicate Henry if he did not first pay his debts to the Papacy and then send the promised army to Sicily . Parliament again refused to assist the King in raising this money . Instead Henry turned to extorting money from the senior clergy , who were forced to sign blank charters , promising to pay effectively unlimited sums of money in support of the King 's efforts , raising around £ 40 @,@ 000 . The English Church felt the money was wasted , vanishing into the long @-@ running war in Italy . 
 Meanwhile , Henry attempted to influence the outcomes of the elections in the Holy Roman Empire , which would appoint a new King of the Romans . When the more prominent German candidates failed to gain traction , Henry began to back his brother Richard 's candidature , giving donations to his potential supporters in the Empire . Richard was elected in 1256 with expectations of possibly being crowned the Holy Roman Emperor , but continued to play a major role in English politics . His election faced a mixed response in England ; Richard was believed to provide moderate , sensible counsel and his presence was missed by the English barons , but he also faced criticism , probably incorrectly , for funding his German campaign at England 's expense . Although Henry now had increased support in the Empire for a potential alliance against Louis of France , the two kings were now moving towards potentially settling their disputes peacefully ; for Henry , a peace treaty could allow him to focus on Sicily and his crusade . 
 = = Later reign ( 1258 – 72 ) = = 
 = = = Revolution = = = 
 In 1258 , Henry faced a revolt among the English barons . Anger had grown about the way the King 's officials were raising funds , the influence of the Poitevins at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy ; even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King . The Welsh were still in open revolt , and now allied themselves with Scotland . Henry was also critically short of money ; although he still had some reserves of gold and silver , they were totally insufficient to cover his potential expenditures , including the campaign for Sicily and his debts to the Papacy . Critics suggested darkly that he had never really intended to join the crusades , and was simply intending to profit from the crusading tithes . To compound the situation , the harvests in England failed . Within Henry 's court there was a strong feeling that the King would be unable to lead the country through these problems . 
 The discontent finally erupted in April , when seven of the major English and Savoyard barons – Simon de Montfort , Roger and Hugh Bigod , John Fitzgeoffrey , Peter de Montfort , Peter de Savoy and Richard de Clare – secretly formed an alliance to expel the Lusignans from court , a move probably quietly supported by the Queen . On 30 April , Roger Bigod marched into Westminster in the middle of the King 's parliament , backed by his co @-@ conspirators , and carried out a coup d 'état . Henry , fearful that he was about to be arrested and imprisoned , agreed to abandon his policy of personal rule and instead govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen , half chosen by the King and half by the barons . His own nominees to the council , however , drew heavily on the hated Lusignans . 
 The pressure for reform continued to grow unabated and a fresh parliament met in June , passing a set of measures known as the Provisions of Oxford , which Henry swore to uphold . These provisions created a smaller council of 15 members , elected solely by the barons , which then had the power to appoint England 's justiciar , chancellor and treasurer , and which would be monitored through triannual parliaments . Pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at Oxford also helped to push through wider reform , intended to limit the abuse of power by both the King 's officials and the major barons . The elected council included representatives of the Savoyard faction but no Poitevins , and the new government immediately took steps to exile the leading Lusignans and to seize key castles across the country . 
 The disagreements between the leading barons involved in the revolt soon became evident . De Montfort championed radical reforms that would place further limitations on the authority and power of the major barons as well as the Crown ; others , such as Hugh Bigod , promoted only moderate change , while the conservative barons , such as de Clare , expressed concerns about the existing limitations on the King 's powers . Henry 's son , Edward , initially opposed the revolution , but then allied himself with de Montfort , helping him to pass the radical Provisions of Westminster in 1259 , which introduced further limits on the major barons and local royal officials . 
 = = = Crisis = = = 
 Over the next four years , neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore stability in England , and power swung back and forth between the different factions . One of the priorities for the new regime , however , was to settle the long @-@ running dispute with France and , at the end of 1259 , Henry and Eleanor left for Paris to negotiate the final details of a peace treaty with King Louis , escorted by Simon de Montfort and much of the baronial government . Under the treaty , Henry gave up any claim to his family 's lands in the north of France , but was confirmed as the legitimate ruler of Gascony and various neighbouring territories in the south , giving homage and recognising Louis as his feudal lord for these possessions . 
 When de Montfort returned to England , Henry , supported by Eleanor , remained in Paris where he seized the opportunity to reassert royal authority and began to issue royal orders independently of the barons . Henry finally returned to retake power in England in April 1260 , where conflict was brewing between de Clare 's forces and those of de Montfort and Edward . Henry 's brother Richard mediated between the parties and averted a military confrontation ; Edward was reconciled with his father and de Montfort was put on trial for his actions against the King . Henry was unable to maintain his grip on power , however , and in October a coalition headed by de Montfort , de Clare and Edward briefly seized back control , but within months their baronial council had collapsed into chaos as well . 
 Henry continued to publicly support the Provisions of Oxford , but he secretly opened discussions with Pope Urban IV , hoping to be absolved from the oath he had made at Oxford . In June 1261 , the King announced that Rome had released him from his promises and he promptly held a counter @-@ coup with the support of Edward . He purged the ranks of the sheriffs of his enemies and seized back control of many of the royal castles . The baronial opposition , led by de Montfort and de Clare , were temporarily reunited in their opposition to Henry 's actions , convening their own parliament , independent of the King , and establishing a rival system of local government across England . Henry and Eleanor mobilised their own supporters and raised a foreign mercenary army . Facing the threat of open civil war , the barons backed down : de Clare switched sides once again , de Montfort left for exile in France and the baronial resistance collapsed . 
 Henry 's government relied primarily on Eleanor and her Savoyard supporters , and it proved short @-@ lived . He attempted to settle the crisis permanently by forcing the barons to agree to the Treaty of Kingston . This treaty introduced a system of arbitration to settle outstanding disputes between the King and the barons , using Richard as an initial adjudicator , backed up by Louis of France should Richard fail to generate a compromise . Henry softened some of his policies in response to the concerns of the barons , but he soon began to target his political enemies and recommence his unpopular Sicilian policy . Henry 's government was weakened by the death of de Clare , as his heir , Gilbert , sided with the radicals ; the King 's position was further undermined by major Welsh incursions along the Marches and the Pope 's decision to reverse his judgement on the Provisions , this time confirming them as legitimate . By early 1263 , Henry 's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war . 
 = = = Second Barons ' War = = = 
 De Montfort returned to England in April 1263 and convened a council of rebel barons in Oxford to pursue a renewed anti @-@ Poitevin agenda . Revolt broke out shortly afterwards in the Welsh Marches and , by October , England faced a likely civil war between Henry , backed by Edward , Bigod and the conservative barons , and de Montfort , de Clare and the radicals . De Montfort marched east with an army and London rose up in revolt . Henry and Eleanor were trapped in the Tower of London by the rebels ; the Queen attempted to escape up the River Thames to join Edward 's army at Windsor , but was forced to retreat by the London crowds . De Montfort took the pair prisoner , and although he maintained a fiction of ruling in Henry 's name , the rebels completely replaced the royal government and household with their own , trusted men . 
 De Montfort 's coalition began to quickly fragment , Henry regained his freedom of movement and renewed chaos spread across England . Henry appealed to Louis of France for arbitration in the dispute , as had been laid out in the Treaty of Kingston ; de Montfort was initially hostile to this idea , but , as war became more likely again , he decided to agree to French arbitration as well . Henry went to Paris in person , accompanied by de Montfort 's representatives . Initially de Montfort 's legal arguments held sway , but in January 1264 , Louis announced the Mise of Amiens , condemning the rebels , upholding the King 's rights and annulling the Provisions of Oxford . Louis had strong views of his own on the rights of kings over those of barons , but was also influenced by his wife , Margaret , who was Eleanor 's sister , and by the Pope . Leaving Eleanor in Paris to assemble mercenary reinforcements , Henry returned to England in February 1264 , where violence was brewing in response to the unpopular French decision . 
 The Second Barons ' War finally broke out in April 1264 , when Henry led an army into de Montfort 's territories in the Midlands , and then advanced south @-@ east to re @-@ occupy the important route to France . Becoming desperate , de Montfort marched in pursuit of Henry and the two armies met at the Battle of Lewes on 14 May . Despite their numerical superiority , Henry 's forces were overwhelmed . His brother Richard was captured , and Henry and Edward retreated to the local priory and surrendered the following day . Henry was forced to pardon the rebel barons and reinstate the Provisions of Oxford , leaving him , as historian Adrian Jobson describes , " little more than a figurehead " . 
 De Montfort was unable to consolidate his victory and widespread disorder persisted across the country . In France , Eleanor made plans for an invasion of England with the support of Louis , while Edward escaped his captors in May and formed a new army . Edward pursued de Monfort 's forces through the Marches , before striking east to attack his fortress at Kenilworth and then turning once more on the rebel leader himself . De Montfort , accompanied by the captive Henry , was unable to retreat and the Battle of Evesham ensued . Edward was triumphant and de Montfort 's corpse was mutilated by the victors ; Henry , who was wearing borrowed armour , was almost killed by Edward 's forces during the fighting before they recognised the King and escorted him to safety . In places the now leaderless rebellion dragged on , with some rebels gathering at Kenilworth , which Henry and Edward took after a long siege in 1266 . The remaining pockets of resistance were mopped up , and the final rebels , holed up in the Isle of Ely , surrendered in July 1267 , marking the end of the war . 
 = = = Reconciliation and reconstruction = = = 
 Henry quickly took revenge on his enemies after the Battle of Evesham . He immediately ordered the sequestration of all the rebel lands , triggering a wave of chaotic looting across the country . Henry initially rejected any calls for moderation , but in October 1266 he was persuaded by the Papal Legate , Ottobuono de ' Fieschi , to issue a less draconian policy , called the Dictum of Kenilworth , which allowed for the return of the rebels ' lands , in exchange for the payment of harsh fines . The Statute of Marlborough followed in November 1267 , which effectively reissued much of the Provisions of Westminster , placing limitations on the powers of local royal officials and the major barons , but without restricting central royal authority . Most of the exiled Poitevins began to return to England after the war . In September 1267 Henry made the Treaty of Montgomery with Llywelyn , recognising him as the Prince of Wales and giving substantial land concessions . 
 In the final years of his reign , Henry was increasingly infirm and focused on securing peace within the kingdom and his own religious devotions . Edward became the Steward of England and began to play a more prominent role in government . Henry 's finances were in a precarious state as a result of the war , and when Edward decided to join the crusades in 1268 it became clear that fresh taxes were necessary . Henry was concerned that Edward 's absence might encourage further revolts , but was swayed by his son to negotiate with multiple parliaments over the next two years to raise the money . De Montfort had exacted harsh penalties on the Jews which Henry initially reversed , but he reintroduced a range of anti @-@ Jewish measures under pressure from parliament in the final years of his reign . Henry continued to invest in Westminster Abbey , which became a replacement for the Angevin mausoleum at Fontevraud Abbey , and in 1269 he oversaw a grand ceremony to rebury Edward the Confessor in a lavish new shrine , personally helping to carry the body to its new resting place . 
 = = Death ( 1272 ) = = 
 Edward left for the Eighth Crusade , led by Louis of France , in 1270 , but Henry became increasingly ill ; concerns about a fresh rebellion grew and the next year the King wrote to his son asking him to return to England , but Edward did not turn back . Henry recovered slightly and announced his renewed intention to join the crusades himself , but he never regained his full health and on the evening of 16 November 1272 , Henry died in Westminster , probably with Eleanor in attendance . He was succeeded by Edward , who slowly made his way back to England via Gascony , finally arriving in August 1274 . 
 At his request , Henry was buried in Westminster Abbey in front of the church 's high altar , in the former resting place of Edward the Confessor . A few years later , work began on a grander tomb for the King and in 1290 Edward moved his father 's body to its current location in Westminster Abbey . His gilt @-@ brass funeral effigy was designed and forged within the abbey grounds by William <unk> ; unlike other effigies of the period , it is particularly naturalistic in style , but it is probably not a close likeness of Henry himself . 
 Eleanor probably hoped that Henry would be recognised as a saint , as his contemporary Louis IX of France had been ; indeed , Henry 's final tomb resembled the shrine of a saint , complete with niches possibly intended to hold relics . When the King 's body was exhumed in 1290 , contemporaries noted that the body was in perfect condition and that Henry 's long beard remained well preserved , which at the time was considered to be an indication of saintly purity . Miracles began to be reported at the tomb , but Edward was sceptical about these stories . The reports ceased , and Henry was never canonised . In 1292 Henry 's heart was removed from his tomb and reburied at Fontevraud Abbey with the bodies of his Angevin family . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 = = = Historiography = = = 
 The first histories of Henry 's reign emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries , relying primarily on the accounts of medieval chroniclers , in particular writings of Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris . These early historians , including Archbishop Matthew Parker , were influenced by contemporary concerns about the roles of the Church and state , and examined the changing nature of kingship under Henry , the emergence of English nationalism during the period and what they perceived to be the malign influence of the Papacy . During the English Civil War , historians also drew parallels between Henry 's experiences and those of the deposed Charles I. 
 By the 19th century , Victorian scholars such as William Stubbs , James Ramsay , and William Hunt sought to understand how the English political system had evolved under Henry . They explored the emergence of Parliamentary institutions during his reign , and sympathized with the concerns of the chroniclers over the role of the Poitevins in England . This focus carried on into early 20th @-@ century research into Henry , such as Kate Norgate 's 1913 volume , which continued to make heavy use of the chronicler accounts and focused primarily on constitutional issues , with a distinctive nationalistic bias . 
 After 1900 , the financial and official records from Henry 's reign began to become accessible to historians , including the pipe rolls , court records , correspondence and records of administration of the royal forests . Thomas Tout made extensive use of these new sources in the 1920s , and post @-@ war historians brought a particular focus on the finances of Henry 's government , highlighting his fiscal difficulties . This wave of research culminated in Sir Maurice Powicke 's two major biographical works on Henry , published in 1948 and 1953 , which formed the established history of the King for the next three decades . 
 Henry 's reign did not receive much attention from historians for many years after the 1950s : no substantial biographies of Henry were written after Powicke 's , and the historian John Beeler observed in the 1970s that the coverage of Henry 's reign by military historians remained particularly thin . At the end of the 20th century , however , there was a renewed interest in 13th @-@ century English history , resulting in the publication of various specialist works on aspects of Henry 's reign , including government finance and the period of Henry 's minority . Current historiography notes both Henry 's positive and negative qualities : historian David Carpenter judges Henry to have been a decent man , who failed as a ruler due to his naivety and inability to produce realistic plans for reform , a theme echoed by Huw Ridgeway , who also notes his unworldliness and inability to manage his court , but who considers him to have been " essentially a man of peace , kind and merciful " . 
 = = = Popular culture = = = 
 Henry 's life was depicted in a series of contemporary illustrations sketched and water @-@ coloured by the chronicler Matthew Paris , mostly drawn in the margins of the Chronica majora . Paris first met Henry in 1236 and enjoyed an extended relationship with the King , although Paris disliked many of Henry 's actions and the illustrations are frequently unflattering . Henry was also shown in the poetry of his Italian contemporary Dante , who depicted Henry in the Divine Comedy as an example of a negligent ruler , sitting alone in Purgatory to one side of the other failed kings . It is unclear why he is shown separately from his contemporaries ; possible explanations include that this is a code by Dante to show that England was not part of the Holy Roman Empire , or that it is a favourable comment on Henry himself , highlighting his unusual piety . Unlike many other medieval kings , Henry did not feature significantly in the works of William Shakespeare , and in the modern period he has not been a prominent subject for films , theatre or television , having only a minimal role in modern popular culture .

 Operation Alfa ( Italian : <unk> Alfa ; Serbo @-@ Croatian : Operacija Alfa , Операција <unk> ) was an offensive carried out in early October 1942 by Italian , Croatian and Chetnik forces against the communist Partisans in the Prozor region ( today in Bosnia and Herzegovina ) , then a part of the Croatian puppet state , the Independent State of Croatia ( NDH ) . 
 The operation was arranged between Generale designato d <unk> ( acting General ) Mario Roatta , commander of the Italian Second Army , and Chetnik commander ( vojvoda ) Ilija Trifunović @-@ Birčanin with approval of Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović . It was carried out in coordination with the Germans and included elements of the Croatian Home Guard and the Croatian Air Force . Faced with heavy weaponry and heavily outnumbered , the Partisans retreated and left Prozor . Chetniks under the command of Dobroslav Jevđević and Petar Baćović then massacred between 543 and 2 @,@ 500 Croats and Muslims , and destroyed numerous villages in the area . Following protests from both the Italians and the Croatian authorities , the Chetniks were discharged or relocated . Italian and NDH forces followed up Operation Alfa with Operation Beta , which was focused on capturing Livno and surrounding localities . Baćović was killed by NDH forces near the end of the war , while Jevđević escaped to Italy and avoided prosecution by the new Yugoslav government . Mihailović was captured by the communists following the war , tried and found guilty for the Chetnik actions at Prozor ( among other charges ) , and was sentenced to death and executed . 
 = = Background = = 
 On 6 April 1941 , the Axis powers invaded the Kingdom of Yugoslavia , resulting in the capitulation of the Royal Yugoslav Army on 17 April . Yugoslavia was broken up , and one of the fragments was the puppet state , the Independent State of Croatia ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Nezavisna Država Hrvatska , <unk> <unk> <unk> , NDH ) , which consisted of modern @-@ day Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina . The NDH was divided by a German – Italian demarcation line , known as the " Vienna Line " with the Germans occupying the northern and northeastern parts of the NDH , and the Italians the southern and southwestern parts . The NDH immediately implemented genocidal policies against the Serb , Jewish and Romani population within its borders . Initial armed resistance consisted of two loosely cooperating factions , the communist @-@ led Partisans , and the Chetniks who were mostly led by Serb @-@ chauvinist officers of the defeated Royal Yugoslav Army . However , the Chetniks , in their pursuit of an ethnically pure Greater Serbia , adopted a policy of collaboration and cooperated " extensively and systematically " with Italian forces . In July and August 1942 , under the protection provided by the Italians , the Chetniks thoroughly ethnically cleansed eastern Herzegovina of its Croats and Muslims . 
 In September 1942 , the Chetniks , knowing that they could not defeat the Partisans alone , attempted to persuade the Italians into carrying out a significant operation within their occupation zone . On 10 and 21 September , Chetnik vojvoda Ilija Trifunović @-@ Birčanin met with Generale designato d <unk> ( acting General ) Mario Roatta , commander of the Italian Second Army . He informed Roatta that he was not under the command of Draža Mihailović , but that he had seen Mihailović in Avtovac on 21 July and that he had his approval in collaborating with the Italians . Trifunović @-@ Birčanin urged Roatta to take action " as soon as possible " in a major operation against the Partisans in the Prozor – Livno area . In return Trifunović @-@ Birčanin offered support in the form of 7 @,@ 500 Chetniks , on the condition that they be provided the necessary arms and supplies . Roatta provided " some arms and promises of action " in response to Trifunović @-@ Birčanin 's demands . Mihailović later congratulated Trifunović @-@ Birčanin on his conduct and " high comprehension of the [ Serbian ] national line " in these arrangements .

 In early October , the operation was launched by the Italians targeting Partisans located northwest of the middle part of the Neretva River . Elements of the 18th Infantry Division Messina , commanded by <unk> generale ( major general ) Guglielmo <unk> took part , consisting of the 29th Battalion of the 4th Bersaglieri Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the 94th Regiment . Between 3 @,@ 000 and 5 @,@ 500 Chetniks took part in the operation under the command of Dobroslav Jevđević and Petar Baćović . Partisan sources reported 4 @,@ 000 soldiers of the Italian 6th Army Corps and 5 @,@ 000 Chetniks of the Trebinje , Nevesinje , and Romanija Corps as being involved . NDH units involved included the 7th Infantry Regiment , under the command of Colonel <unk> beg Filipović , and the 15th Infantry Regiment , under the command of Colonel Josip <unk> , as well as the Croatian Air Force . 
 The operation was coordinated with Germans and NDH armed forces located near northern Partisan territory in the direction of Banja Luka . The Chetniks arrived by trains from Dubrovnik and Metković and by Italian trucks from Nevesinje . On 2 – 3 October they arrived in Mostar and left on 3 October . The same day , they killed one villager and committed mass looting in the village of Raška Gora , 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) north of Mostar . In the village of <unk> , 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) southwest of Mostar , three villagers were killed and , as elsewhere , they carried out looting and burning . The next day they were in Drežnica where Jevđević gave a speech that " the chief enemy of Serbs are the Partisans , then the Ustaše . They need to be ruthlessly destroyed and the other left alone " . Subsequently the Chetniks killed between 62 and 142 people , looted , and carried out burnings in the town .

 On 4 – 5 October the Chetniks crossed the Neretva River in Konjic and headed , as did the Italians , towards Prozor , <unk> , Gornji Vakuf , Donji Vakuf , and on to Bugojno , <unk> , and Travnik where the headquarters of the 5th Montenegrin and the 10th Herzegovinian Partisan brigades were situated . The offensive took place from three directions with light and heavy artillery and a large number of tanks and trucks converging . Three battalions of the 10th Herzegovinian Brigade intended to assemble near Prozor , but withdrew and escaped on 6 October before the arrival of the Italian – Chetnik forces . The Partisan battalions estimated that 1 @,@ 200 – 1 @,@ 500 soldiers of the Italian army and about 3 @,@ 000 – 3 @,@ 500 Chetniks were approaching , while they had a little over 300 men , a ratio of approximately 1 : 15 . 
 On 7 – 8 October the Italians heavily bombed Prozor with artillery and airplanes and entered the town on 8 October . On the same day , Mihailović informed his commanders in Herzegovina that " now is the definite time to wipe out the communists " and to be as tactical as possible with the Muslims and Croats . The nature of these tactics required the Muslims to " only be organized under the command of our [ Chetnik ] military leaders and in our struggle against the Ustaše and the communists with complete loyalty to the Serb population to repair the shameful role they 've played since the capitulation of Yugoslavia up to today " . He also called for the Muslims to " take part in the liquidation of those Muslims who still today work against the Serb people " . As for the Croats : " what will become of the borders of the Croatian unit and what rights the Croats will have in the new state of the future will depend solely on them " . He explained that " if they continue to be inactive , there will be no force that will be able to protect them from the retribution of the Serb people , so let them guide themselves in accordance with that " and announced that after the " liquidation of communists , they will be able to liquidate the Ustaša " . 
 On 14 – 15 October , the Chetniks , acting on their own , massacred over five hundred Croats and Muslims and burnt numerous villages in the process of the operation on the suspicion that they " harbored and aided the Partisans " . According to the historian Jozo Tomasevich , incomplete data shows 543 civilians were massacred . At least 656 victims are known by name while another source says about 848 people , mainly " children , women , and the elderly " , were killed . Historian Ivo Goldstein estimates 1 @,@ 500 were massacred in total and attributes the discrepancy " due to the fact that the estimates refer to different territories " . Historian Antun Miletić and Vladimir Dedijer place the figure killed at 2 @,@ 500 . 
 In the following days , around 2 @,@ 000 Chetniks were in the district of Prozor . According to Partisan sources , they moved southeast to the Neretva River and Mostar at the request of Italian officers . Partisan sources claim that this was done because Chetnik and Italian atrocities caused great resentment in the local population , especially the Croatian Home Guard , which felt obliged to intervene militarily in such instances . Chetnik commanders argued that this move was initiated by Germans to prevent the Chetniks from heading west towards Mount Dinara . 
 After the killings , Muslim Chetnik leader Ismet Popovac arrived in the town to console the local population and to advise the Chetniks there against committing further atrocities . He also attempted to convince local Muslims to join the Chetnik ranks but was unsuccessful due to the extent of Chetnik atrocities against the Muslim population . 
 On 23 October , Baćović reported to Mihailović that " in the operation of Prozor we slaughtered more than 2 @,@ 000 Croats and Muslims . Our soldiers returned enthusiastic . " Borba , a Partisan newspaper , also reported that " about 2 @,@ 000 souls " were " killed by the Chetniks in Croatian and Muslim villages of Prozor , Konjic , and Vakuf " . The report also mentions that " the districts of Prozor and Konjic have hundreds of slaughtered and murdered women and children as well as burnt houses " . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Roatta objected to the mass slaughters and said Italian support would come to a halt if they did not cease . He requested that " commander Trifunović be apprised that if the Chetnik violence against the Croatian and Muslim population is not immediately stopped , we will stop supplying food and daily wages to those formations whose members are perpetrators of the violence . If this criminal situation continues , more severe measures will be undertaken " . The massacre upset the NDH government which compelled the Italians to force the Chetniks to withdraw . Some forces were discharged while some were relocated to join Momčilo Đujić 's forces in northern Dalmatia . Operation Beta later followed in the same month in which the Italians and NDH forces captured Livno and surrounding localities . 
 After the war an indictment was issued against Jevđević in Sarajevo . It charged that under his command in " the first half of October 1942 in and around Prozor they [ Italians and Chetniks ] butchered and killed 1 @,@ 716 persons of both sexes , Croatian and Muslim nations , and plundered and burnt about 500 households " . A month after the massacre , Jevđević and Baćović wrote a self @-@ critical report on Prozor to Mihailović in order to distance their responsibility . Jevđević fled to Italy at the end of the war where Allied military authorities arrested and detained him at a camp . They ignored Yugoslavia 's request for extradition and set him free . He avoided trial and died in Rome in 1962 . Baćović was killed by the Ustaše in 1945 and also did not come to trial . 
 Mihailović was indicted and in 1946 the Supreme Court of Yugoslavia judged him guilty of leading a movement " which committed numerous war crimes against people " that , among other things , in " October 1942 , under the leadership of Petar Baćović together with the Italians , killed in the vicinity of Prozor about 2 @,@ 500 Muslims and Croats , among whom were women , children , and the elderly , and burnt a large number of villages " . He was sentenced to death and executed .

 = Blackbeard = 
 Edward Teach or Edward Thatch ( c . 1680 – 22 November 1718 ) , better known as Blackbeard , was a notorious English pirate who operated around the West Indies and the eastern coast of the American colonies . Although little is known about his early life , he was probably born in Bristol , England . Recent genealogical research indicates his family moved to Jamaica where Edward Thatch , Jr. is listed as being a mariner in the Royal Navy aboard the HMS Windsor in 1706 . He may have been a sailor on privateer ships during Queen Anne 's War before settling on the Bahamian island of New Providence , a base for Captain Benjamin Hornigold , whose crew Teach joined sometime around 1716 . Hornigold placed him in command of a sloop he had captured , and the two engaged in numerous acts of piracy . Their numbers were boosted by the addition to their fleet of two more ships , one of which was commanded by Stede Bonnet , but toward the end of 1717 Hornigold retired from piracy , taking two vessels with him . 
 Teach captured a French merchant vessel , renamed her Queen Anne 's Revenge , and equipped her with 40 guns . He became a renowned pirate , his cognomen derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance ; he was reported to have tied lit fuses under his hat to frighten his enemies . He formed an alliance of pirates and blockaded the port of Charleston , South Carolina . After successfully ransoming its inhabitants , he ran Queen Anne 's Revenge aground on a sandbar near Beaufort , North Carolina . He parted company with Bonnet and settled in Bath Town , where he accepted a royal pardon . But he was soon back at sea , where he attracted the attention of Alexander Spotswood , the Governor of Virginia . Spotswood arranged for a party of soldiers and sailors to try to capture the pirate , which they did on 22 November 1718 . During a ferocious battle , Teach and several of his crew were killed by a small force of sailors led by Lieutenant Robert Maynard . 
 A shrewd and calculating leader , Teach spurned the use of force , relying instead on his fearsome image to elicit the response he desired from those he robbed . Contrary to the modern @-@ day picture of the traditional tyrannical pirate , he commanded his vessels with the permission of their crews and there is no known account of his ever having harmed or murdered those he held captive . He was romanticised after his death and became the inspiration for pirate @-@ themed works of fiction across a range of genres . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Little is known about Blackbeard 's early life . It is commonly believed that at the time of his death he was between 35 and 40 years old and thus born in about 1680 . In contemporary records his name is most often given as Blackbeard , Edward Thatch or Edward Teach ; the latter is most often used today . However , several spellings of his surname exist — Thatch , Thach , <unk> , <unk> , Tack , <unk> and <unk> . One early source claims that his surname was Drummond , but the lack of any supporting documentation makes this unlikely . Pirates habitually used fictitious surnames while engaged in the business of piracy , so as not to tarnish the family name , and this makes it unlikely that Teach 's real name will ever be known . 
 The 17th @-@ century rise of Britain 's American colonies and the rapid 18th @-@ century expansion of the Atlantic slave trade had made Bristol an important international sea port , and Teach was most likely raised in what was the second @-@ largest city in England . He could almost certainly read and write ; he communicated with merchants and when killed had in his possession a letter addressed to him by the Chief Justice and Secretary of the Province of Carolina , Tobias Knight . The author Robert Lee speculated that Teach may therefore have been born into a respectable , wealthy family . He may have arrived in the Caribbean in the last years of the 17th century , on a merchant vessel ( possibly a slave ship ) . The 18th @-@ century author Charles Johnson claimed that Teach was for some time a sailor operating from Jamaica on privateer ships during Queen Anne 's War , and that " he had often distinguished himself for his uncommon boldness and personal courage " . At what point during the war Teach joined the fighting is , in keeping with the record of most of his life before he became a pirate , unknown . 
 = = New Providence = = 
 With its history of colonialism , trade and piracy , the West Indies was the setting for many 17th and 18th @-@ century maritime incidents . The privateer @-@ turned @-@ pirate Henry Jennings and his followers decided , early in the 18th century , to use the then uninhabited island of New Providence as a base for their operations ; it was within easy reach of the Florida Strait and its busy shipping lanes , which were filled with European vessels crossing the Atlantic . New Providence 's harbour could easily accommodate hundreds of ships , and was too shallow for the Royal Navy 's larger vessels to navigate . The island then was not the popular tourist destination it later became ; the author George Woodbury described it as " no city of homes ; it was a place of temporary sojourn and refreshment for a literally floating population , " continuing , " The only permanent residents were the piratical camp followers , the traders , and the hangers @-@ on ; all others were transient . " Law and order were unheard of ; in New Providence , pirates found a welcome respite . 
 Teach was one of those who came to enjoy the island 's benefits . Probably shortly after the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht , he moved there from Jamaica , and with most privateers once involved in the war , became involved in piracy . Possibly about 1716 , he joined the crew of Captain Benjamin Hornigold , a renowned pirate who operated from New Providence 's safe waters . In 1716 Hornigold placed Teach in charge of a sloop he had taken as a prize . In early 1717 , Hornigold and Teach , each captaining a sloop , set out for the mainland . They captured a boat carrying 120 barrels of flour out of Havana , and shortly thereafter took 100 barrels of wine from a sloop out of Bermuda . A few days later they stopped a vessel sailing from Madeira to Charleston , South Carolina . Teach and his quartermaster , William Howard , may at this time have struggled to control their crews . By then they had probably developed a taste for Madeira wine , and on 29 September near Cape Charles all they took from the Betty of Virginia was her cargo of Madeira , before they scuttled her with the remaining cargo . 
 It was during this cruise with Hornigold that the earliest known report of Teach was made , in which he is recorded as a pirate in his own right , in command of a large crew . In a report made by a Captain Mathew Munthe on an anti @-@ piracy patrol for North Carolina , " Thatch " was described as operating " a sloop 6 <unk> [ sic ] and about 70 men " . In September Teach and Hornigold encountered Stede Bonnet , a landowner and military officer from a wealthy family who had turned to piracy earlier that year . Bonnet 's crew of about 70 were reportedly dissatisfied with his command , so with Bonnet 's permission , Teach took control of his ship Revenge . The pirates ' flotilla now consisted of three ships ; Teach on Revenge , Teach 's old sloop and Hornigold 's Ranger . By October , another vessel had been captured and added to the small fleet . The sloops Robert of Philadelphia and Good Intent of Dublin were stopped on 22 October 1717 , and their cargo holds emptied . 
 As a former British privateer , Hornigold attacked only his old enemies , but for his crew , the sight of British vessels filled with valuable cargo passing by unharmed became too much , and at some point toward the end of 1717 he was demoted . Whether Teach had any involvement in this decision is unknown , but Hornigold quickly retired from piracy . He took Ranger and one of the sloops , leaving Teach with Revenge and the remaining sloop . The two never met again , and with many other occupants of New Providence , Hornigold accepted the King 's pardon from Woodes Rogers in June the following year . 
 = = = Blackbeard = = = 
 On 28 November Teach 's two ships attacked a French merchant vessel off the coast of Saint Vincent . They each fired a broadside across its bulwarks , killing several of its crew , and forcing its captain to surrender . The ship was La Concorde of Saint @-@ Malo , a large French <unk> carrying a cargo of slaves . Teach and his crews sailed the vessel south along Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to Bequia , where they disembarked her crew and cargo , and converted the ship for their own use . The crew of La Concorde were given the smaller of Teach 's two sloops , which they renamed <unk> <unk> ( Bad Meeting ) , and sailed for Martinique . Teach may have recruited some of their slaves , but the remainder were left on the island and were later recaptured by the returning crew of <unk> <unk> . 
 Teach immediately renamed La Concorde as Queen Anne 's Revenge and equipped her with 40 guns . In late November , near Saint Vincent , he attacked the Great Allen . After a lengthy engagement , he forced the large and well @-@ armed merchant ship to surrender . He ordered her to move closer to the shore , disembarked her crew and emptied her cargo holds , and then burned and sank the vessel . The incident was chronicled in the Boston News @-@ Letter , which called Teach the commander of a " French ship of 32 Guns , a <unk> of 10 guns and a Sloop of 12 guns . " When or where Teach collected the ten gun <unk> is unknown , but by that time he may have been in command of at least 150 men split between three vessels . 
 On 5 December 1717 Teach stopped the merchant sloop Margaret off the coast of Crab Island , near Anguilla . Her captain , Henry Bostock , and crew , remained Teach 's prisoners for about eight hours , and were forced to watch as their sloop was ransacked . Bostock , who had been held aboard Queen Anne 's Revenge , was returned unharmed to Margaret and was allowed to leave with his crew . He returned to his base of operations on Saint Christopher Island and reported the matter to Governor Walter Hamilton , who requested that he sign an affidavit about the encounter . Bostock 's deposition details Teach 's command of two vessels : a sloop and a large French <unk> , Dutch @-@ built , with 36 cannon and a crew of 300 men . The captain believed that the larger ship carried valuable gold dust , silver plate , and " a very fine cup " supposedly taken from the commander of Great Allen . Teach 's crew had apparently informed Bostock that they had destroyed several other vessels , and that they intended to sail to Hispaniola and lie in wait for an expected Spanish armada , supposedly laden with money to pay the garrisons . Bostock also claimed that Teach had questioned him about the movements of local ships , but also that he had seemed unsurprised when Bostock told him of an expected royal pardon from London for all pirates . 
 Bostock 's deposition describes Teach as a " tall spare man with a very black beard which he wore very long " . It is the first recorded account of Teach 's appearance and is the source of his cognomen , Blackbeard . Later descriptions mention that his thick black beard was braided into pigtails , sometimes tied in with small coloured ribbons . Johnson ( 1724 ) described him as " such a figure that imagination cannot form an idea of a fury from hell to look more frightful . " Whether Johnson 's description was entirely truthful or embellished is unclear , but it seems likely that Teach understood the value of appearances ; better to strike fear into the heart of one 's enemies , than rely on bluster alone . Teach was tall , with broad shoulders . He wore knee @-@ length boots and dark clothing , topped with a wide hat and sometimes a long coat of brightly coloured silk or velvet . Johnson also described Teach in times of battle as wearing " a sling over his shoulders , with three brace of pistols , hanging in holsters like bandoliers ; and stuck lighted matches under his hat " , the latter apparently to emphasise the fearsome appearance he wished to present to his enemies . Despite his ferocious reputation though , there are no verified accounts of his ever having murdered or harmed those he held captive . Teach may have used other aliases ; on 30 November , the Monserrat Merchant encountered two ships and a sloop , commanded by a Captain Kentish and Captain Edwards ( the latter a known alias of Stede Bonnet ) . 
 = = = Enlargement of Teach 's fleet = = = 
 Teach 's movements between late 1717 and early 1718 are not known . He and Bonnet were probably responsible for an attack off Sint Eustatius in December 1717 . Henry Bostock claimed to have heard the pirates say they would head toward the Spanish @-@ controlled Samaná Bay in Hispaniola , but a cursory search revealed no pirate activity . Captain Hume of HMS Scarborough reported on 6 February that a " <unk> Ship of 36 Guns and 250 men , and a Sloop of 10 Guns and 100 men were Said to be <unk> amongst the Leeward Islands " . Hume reinforced his crew with musket @-@ armed soldiers and joined up with HMS Seaford to track the two ships , to no avail , though they discerned that the two ships had sunk a French vessel off St Christopher Island , and reported also that they had last been seen " gone down the North side of Hispaniola " . Although no confirmation exists that these two ships were controlled by Teach and Bonnet , author Angus Konstam believes it very likely they were . 
 In March 1718 , while taking on water at Turneffe Island east of Belize , both ships spotted the Jamaican logwood cutting sloop Adventure making for the harbour . She was stopped and her captain , David Harriot , invited to join the pirates . Harriot and his crew accepted the invitation , and Teach sent over a crew to sail Adventure making Israel Hands the captain . They sailed for the Bay of Honduras , where they added another ship and four sloops to their flotilla . On 9 April Teach 's enlarged fleet of ships looted and burnt Protestant Caesar . His fleet then sailed to Grand Cayman where they captured a " small <unk> " . Teach probably sailed toward Havana , where he may have captured a small Spanish vessel that had left the Cuban port . They then sailed to the wrecks of the 1715 Spanish fleet , off the eastern coast of Florida . There Teach disembarked the crew of the captured Spanish sloop , before proceeding north to the port of Charleston , South Carolina , attacking three vessels along the way . 
 = = = Blockade of Charleston = = = 
 By May 1718 Teach had awarded himself the rank of Commodore and was at the height of his power . Late that month his flotilla blockaded the port of Charleston ( then known as Charles Town ) in South Carolina . All vessels entering or leaving the port were stopped , and as the town had no guard ship , its pilot boat was the first to be captured . Over the next five or six days about nine vessels were stopped and ransacked as they attempted to sail past Charleston Bar , where Teach 's fleet was anchored . One such ship , headed for London with a group of prominent Charleston citizens which included Samuel Wragg ( a member of the Council of the Province of Carolina ) , was the Crowley . Her passengers were questioned about the vessels still in port and then locked below decks for about half a day . Teach informed the prisoners that his fleet required medical supplies from the colonial government of South Carolina , and that if none were forthcoming , all prisoners would be executed , their heads sent to the Governor and all captured ships burnt . 
 Wragg agreed to Teach 's demands , and a Mr Marks and two pirates were given two days to collect the drugs . Teach moved his fleet , and the captured ships , to within about five or six leagues from land . Three days later a messenger , sent by Marks , returned to the fleet ; Marks 's boat had capsized and delayed their arrival in Charleston . Teach granted a reprieve of two days , but still the party did not return . He then called a meeting of his fellow sailors and moved eight ships into the harbour , causing panic within the town . When Marks finally returned to the fleet , he explained what had happened . On his arrival he had presented the pirates ' demands to the Governor and the drugs had been quickly gathered , but the two pirates sent to escort him had proved difficult to find ; they had been busy drinking with friends and were finally discovered , drunk . 
 Teach kept to his side of the bargain and released the captured ships and his prisoners — albeit relieved of their valuables , including the fine clothing some had worn . 
 = = = Beaufort Inlet = = = 
 Whilst at Charleston , Teach learned that Woodes Rogers had left England with several men @-@ of @-@ war , with orders to purge the West Indies of pirates . Teach 's flotilla sailed northward along the Atlantic coast and into Topsail Inlet ( commonly known as Beaufort Inlet ) , off the coast of North Carolina . There they intended to careen their ships to scrape their hulls , but Queen Anne 's Revenge ran aground on a sandbar , cracking her main @-@ mast and severely damaging many of her timbers . Teach ordered several sloops to throw ropes across the flagship in an attempt to free her . A sloop commanded by Israel Hands of Adventure also ran aground , and both vessels appeared to be damaged beyond repair , leaving only Revenge and the captured Spanish sloop . 
 Teach had at some stage learnt of the offer of a royal pardon and probably confided in Bonnet his willingness to accept it . The pardon was open to all pirates who surrendered on or before 5 September 1718 , but contained a caveat stipulating that immunity was offered only against crimes committed before 5 January . Although in theory this left Bonnet and Teach at risk of being hanged for their actions at Charleston Bar , most authorities could waive such conditions . Teach thought that Governor Charles Eden was a man he could trust , but to make sure , he waited to see what would happen to another captain . Bonnet left immediately on a small sailing boat for Bath Town , where he surrendered to Governor Eden , and received his pardon . He then travelled back to Beaufort Inlet to collect the Revenge and the remainder of his crew , intending to sail to Saint Thomas Island to receive a commission . Unfortunately for him , Teach had stripped the vessel of its valuables and provisions , and had marooned its crew ; Bonnet set out for revenge , but was unable to find him . He and his crew returned to piracy and were captured on 27 September 1718 at the mouth of the Cape Fear River . All but four were tried and hanged in Charleston . 
 The author Robert Lee surmised that Teach and Hands intentionally ran the ships aground to reduce the fleet 's crew complement , increasing their share of the spoils . During the trial of Bonnet 's crew , Revenge 's boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that " the ship was run ashore and lost , which Thatch [ Teach ] caused to be done . " Lee considers it plausible that Teach let Bonnet in on his plan to accept a pardon from Governor Eden . He suggested that Bonnet do the same , and as war between the Quadruple Alliance of 1718 and Spain was threatening , to consider taking a privateer 's commission from England . Lee suggests that Teach also offered Bonnet the return of his ship Revenge . Konstam ( 2007 ) proposes a similar idea , explaining that Teach began to see Queen Anne 's Revenge as something of a liability ; while a pirate fleet was anchored , news of this was sent to neighbouring towns and colonies , and any vessels nearby would delay sailing . It was prudent therefore for Teach not to linger for too long , although wrecking the ship was a somewhat extreme measure . 
 = = = Pardon = = = 
 Before sailing northward on his remaining sloop to Ocracoke Inlet , Teach marooned about 25 men on a small sandy island about a league from the mainland . He may have done this to stifle any protest they made , if they guessed their captain 's plans . Bonnet rescued them two days later . Teach continued on to Bath , where in June 1718 — only days after Bonnet had departed with his pardon — he and his much @-@ reduced crew received their pardon from Governor Eden . 
 He settled in Bath , on the eastern side of Bath Creek at Plum Point , near Eden 's home . During July and August he travelled between his base in the town and his sloop off Ocracoke . Johnson 's account states that he married the daughter of a local plantation owner , although there is no supporting evidence for this . Eden gave Teach permission to sail to St Thomas to seek a commission as a privateer ( a useful way of removing bored and troublesome pirates from the small settlement ) , and Teach was given official title to his remaining sloop , which he renamed Adventure . By the end of August he had returned to piracy , and in the same month the Governor of Pennsylvania issued a warrant for his arrest , but by then Teach was probably operating in Delaware Bay , some distance away . He took two French ships leaving the Caribbean , moved one crew across to the other , and sailed the remaining ship back to Ocracoke . In September he told Eden that he had found the French ship at sea , deserted . A Vice Admiralty Court was quickly convened , presided over by Tobias Knight and the Collector of Customs . The ship was judged as a derelict found at sea , and of its cargo 20 hogsheads of sugar were awarded to Knight and sixty to Eden ; Teach and his crew were given what remained in the vessel 's hold . 
 Ocracoke Inlet was Teach 's favourite anchorage . It was a perfect vantage point from which to view ships travelling between the various settlements of northeast Carolina , and it was from there that Teach first spotted the approaching ship of Charles Vane , another English pirate . Several months earlier Vane had rejected the pardon brought by Woodes Rogers and escaped the men @-@ of @-@ war the English captain brought with him to Nassau . He had also been pursued by Teach 's old commander , Benjamin Hornigold , who was by then a pirate hunter . Teach and Vane spent several nights on the southern tip of Ocracoke Island , accompanied by such notorious figures as Israel Hands , Robert Deal and Calico Jack . 
 = = = Alexander Spotswood = = = 
 As it spread throughout the neighbouring colonies , the news of Teach and Vane 's impromptu party worried the Governor of Pennsylvania enough to send out two sloops to capture the pirates . They were unsuccessful , but Governor of Virginia Alexander Spotswood was also concerned that the supposedly retired freebooter and his crew were living in nearby North Carolina . Some of Teach 's former crew had already moved into several Virginian seaport towns , prompting Spotswood to issue a proclamation on 10 July , requiring all former pirates to make themselves known to the authorities , to give up their arms and to not travel in groups larger than three . As head of a Crown colony , Spotswood viewed the proprietary colony of North Carolina with contempt ; he had little faith in the ability of the Carolinians to control the pirates , who he suspected would be back to their old ways , disrupting Virginian commerce , as soon as their money ran out . 
 Spotswood learnt that William Howard , the former quartermaster of Queen Anne 's Revenge , was in the area , and believing that he might know of Teach 's whereabouts had the pirate and his two slaves arrested . Spotswood had no legal authority to have pirates tried , and as a result , Howard 's attorney , John Holloway , brought charges against Captain Brand of HMS Lyme , where Howard was imprisoned . He also sued on Howard 's behalf for damages of £ 500 , claiming wrongful arrest . 
 Spotswood 's council claimed that Teach 's presence was a crisis and that under a statute of William III , the governor was entitled to try Howard without a jury . The charges referred to several acts of piracy supposedly committed after the pardon 's cut @-@ off date , in " a sloop belonging to ye subjects of the King of Spain " , but ignored the fact that they took place outside Spotswood 's jurisdiction and in a vessel then legally owned . Another charge cited two attacks , one of which was the capture of a slave ship off Charleston Bar , from which one of Howard 's slaves was presumed to have come . Howard was sent to await trial before a Court of Vice @-@ Admiralty , on the charge of piracy , but Brand and his colleague , Captain Gordon ( of HMS Pearl ) refused to serve with Holloway present . Incensed , Holloway had no option but to stand down , and was replaced by the Attorney General of Virginia , John Clayton , whom Spotswood described as " an <unk> man [ than Holloway ] " . Howard was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged , but was saved by a commission from London , which directed Spotswood to pardon all acts of piracy committed by surrendering pirates before 23 July 1718 . 
 Meanwhile , Spotswood had obtained from Howard valuable information on Teach 's whereabouts , and he planned to send his forces across the border into North Carolina to capture him . He gained the support of two men keen to discredit North Carolina 's Governor — Edward Moseley and Colonel Maurice Moore . He also wrote to the Lords of Trade , suggesting that the Crown might benefit financially from Teach 's capture . Spotswood personally financed the operation , possibly believing that Teach had fabulous treasures hidden away . He ordered Captains Gordon and Brand of HMS Pearl and HMS Lyme to travel overland to Bath . Lieutenant Robert Maynard of HMS Pearl was given command of two commandeered sloops , to approach the town from the sea . An extra incentive for Teach 's capture was the offer of a reward from the Assembly of Virginia , over and above any that might be received from the Crown . 
 Maynard took command of the two armed sloops on 17 November . He was given 57 men — 33 from HMS Pearl and 24 from HMS Lyme . Maynard and the detachment from HMS Pearl took the larger of the two vessels and named her Jane ; the rest took Ranger , commanded by one of Maynard 's officers , a Mister Hyde . Some from the two ships ' civilian crews remained aboard . They sailed from <unk> , along the James River , on 17 November . The two sloops moved slowly , giving Brand 's force time to reach Bath . Brand set out for North Carolina six days later , arriving within three miles of Bath on 23 November . Included in Brand 's force were several North Carolinians , including Colonel Moore and Captain Jeremiah Vail , sent to put down any local objection to the presence of foreign soldiers . Moore went into the town to see if Teach was there , reporting back that he was not , but that the pirate was expected at " every minute . " Brand then went to Governor Eden 's home and informed him of his purpose . The next day , Brand sent two canoes down Pamlico River to Ocracoke Inlet , to see if Teach could be seen . They returned two days later and reported on what eventually transpired . 
 = = = Last battle = = = 
 Maynard found the pirates anchored on the inner side of Ocracoke Island , on the evening of 21 November . He had ascertained their position from ships he had stopped along his journey , but unfamiliar with the local channels and shoals he decided to wait until the following morning to make his attack . He stopped all traffic from entering the inlet — preventing any warning of his presence — and posted a lookout on both sloops to ensure that Teach could not escape to sea . On the other side of the island , Teach was busy entertaining guests and had not set a lookout . With Israel Hands ashore in Bath with about 24 of Adventure 's sailors , he also had a much @-@ reduced crew . Johnson ( 1724 ) reported that the pirate had " no more than twenty @-@ five men on board " and that he " gave out to all the vessels that he spoke with that he had forty " . " Thirteen white and six Negroes " , was the number later reported by Brand to the Admiralty . 
 At daybreak , preceded by a small boat taking soundings , Maynard 's two sloops entered the channel . The small craft was quickly spotted by Adventure and fired at as soon as it was within range of her guns . While the boat made a quick retreat to the Jane , Teach cut the Adventure 's anchor cable . His crew hoisted the sails and the Adventure manoeuvred to point her starboard guns toward Maynard 's sloops , which were slowly closing the gap . Hyde moved Ranger to the port side of Jane and the Union flag was unfurled on each ship . Adventure then turned toward the beach of Ocracoke Island , heading for a narrow channel . What happened next is uncertain . Johnson claimed that there was an exchange of small @-@ arms fire following which Adventure ran aground on a sandbar , while Maynard anchored and then lightened his ship to pass over the obstacle . Another version claimed that Jane and Ranger ran aground , although Maynard made no mention of this in his log . 
 What is certain though is that Adventure turned her guns on the two ships and fired . The broadside was devastating ; in an instant , Maynard had lost as much as a third of his forces . About 20 on Jane were either wounded or killed and 9 on Ranger . Hyde was dead and his second and third officers either dead or seriously injured . His sloop was so badly damaged that it played no further role in the attack . Again , contemporary accounts of what happened next are confused , but small @-@ arms fire from Jane may have cut Adventure 's jib sheet , causing her to lose control and run onto the sandbar . In the aftermath of Teach 's overwhelming attack , Jane and Ranger may also have been grounded ; the battle thenceforth would have become a race to see who could float their ship first . 
 The lieutenant had kept many of his men below deck and in anticipation of being boarded told them to prepare for close fighting . Teach watched as the gap between the vessels closed , and ordered his men to be ready . The two vessels contacted one another as the Adventure 's grappling hooks hit their target and several grenades , made from powder and shot @-@ filled bottles and ignited by fuses , broke across the sloop 's deck . As the smoke cleared , Teach led his men aboard , buoyant at the sight of Maynard 's apparently empty ship , his men firing at the small group formed by the lieutenant and his men at the stern . 
 The rest of Maynard 's men then burst from the hold , shouting and firing . The plan to surprise Teach and his crew worked ; the pirates were apparently taken aback at the assault . Teach rallied his men and the two groups fought across the deck , which was already slick with blood from those killed or injured by Teach 's broadside . Maynard and Teach fired their flintlocks at each other , then threw them away . Teach drew his cutlass and managed to break Maynard 's sword . Against superior training and a slight advantage in numbers , the pirates were pushed back toward the bow , allowing the Jane 's crew to surround Maynard and Teach , who was by then completely isolated . As Maynard drew back to fire once again , Teach moved in to attack him , but was slashed across the neck by one of Maynard 's men . Badly wounded , he was then attacked and killed by several more of Maynard 's crew . The remaining pirates quickly surrendered . Those left on the Adventure were captured by the Ranger 's crew , including one who planned to set fire to the powder room and blow up the ship . Varying accounts exist of the battle 's list of casualties ; Maynard reported that 8 of his men and 12 pirates were killed . Brand reported that 10 pirates and 11 of Maynard 's men were killed . Spotswood claimed ten pirates and ten of the King 's men dead . 
 Maynard later examined Teach 's body , noting that it had been shot no fewer than five times and cut about twenty . He also found several items of correspondence , including a letter to the pirate from Tobias Knight . Teach 's corpse was thrown into the inlet while his head was suspended from the bowsprit of Maynard 's sloop so that the reward could be collected . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Lieutenant Maynard remained at Ocracoke for several more days , making repairs and burying the dead . Teach 's loot — sugar , cocoa , indigo and cotton — found " in pirate sloops and ashore in a tent where the sloops lay " , was sold at auction along with sugar and cotton found in Tobias Knight 's barn , for £ 2 @,@ 238 . Governor Spotswood used a portion of this to pay for the entire operation . The prize money for capturing Teach was to have been about £ 400 , but it was split between the crews of HMS Lyme and HMS Pearl . As Captain Brand and his troops had not been the ones fighting for their lives , Maynard thought this extremely unfair . He lost much of any support he may have had though when it was discovered that he and his crew had helped themselves to about £ 90 of Teach 's booty . The two companies did not receive their prize money for another four years , and despite his bravery Maynard was not promoted ; instead , he faded into obscurity . 
 The remainder of Teach 's crew and former associates were found by Brand , in Bath , and were transported to Williamsburg , Virginia , where they were jailed on charges of piracy . Several were black , prompting Spotswood to ask his council what could be done about " the Circumstances of these Negroes to exempt them from undergoing the same Tryal as other pirates . " Regardless , the men were tried with their comrades in Williamsburg 's Capitol building , under admiralty law , on 12 March 1719 . No records of the day 's proceedings remain , but 14 of the 16 accused were found guilty . Of the remaining two , one proved that he had partaken of the fight out of necessity , having been on Teach 's ship only as a guest at a drinking party the night before , and not as a pirate . The other , Israel Hands , was not present at the fight . He claimed that during a drinking session Teach had shot him in the knee , and that he was still covered by the royal pardon . The remaining pirates were hanged , then left to rot in gibbets along Williamsburg 's Capitol Landing Road ( known for some time after as " Gallows Road " ) . 
 Governor Eden was certainly embarrassed by Spotswood 's invasion of North Carolina , while Spotswood disavowed himself of any part of the seizure . He defended his actions , writing to Lord Carteret , a shareholder of the Province of Carolina , that he might benefit from the sale of the seized property and reminding the Earl of the number of Virginians who had died to protect his interests . He argued for the secrecy of the operation by suggesting that Eden " could contribute nothing to the Success of the Design " , and told Eden that his authority to capture the pirates came from the king . Eden was heavily criticised for his involvement with Teach and was accused of being his accomplice . By criticising Eden , Spotswood intended to bolster the legitimacy of his invasion . Lee ( 1974 ) concludes that although Spotswood may have thought that the ends justified the means , he had no legal authority to invade North Carolina , to capture the pirates and to seize and auction their goods . Eden doubtless shared the same view . As Spotswood had also accused Tobias Knight of being in league with Teach , on 4 April 1719 , Eden had Knight brought in for questioning . Israel Hands had , weeks earlier , testified that Knight had been on board the Adventure in August 1718 , shortly after Teach had brought a French ship to North Carolina as a prize . Four pirates had testified that with Teach , they had visited Knight 's home to give him presents . This testimony and the letter found on Teach 's body by Maynard appeared compelling , but Knight conducted his defence with competence . Despite being very sick and close to death , he questioned the reliability of Spotswood 's witnesses . He claimed that Israel Hands had talked under duress , and that under North Carolinian law , the other witness , an African , was unable to testify . The sugar , he argued , was stored at his house legally , and Teach had visited him only on business , in his official capacity . The board found Knight innocent of all charges . He died later that year . 
 Eden was annoyed that the accusations against Knight arose during a trial in which he played no part . The goods which Brand seized were officially North Carolinian property and Eden considered him a thief . The argument raged back and forth between the colonies until Eden 's death on 17 March 1722 . His will named one of Spotswood 's opponents , John Holloway , a beneficiary . In the same year , Spotswood , who for years had fought his enemies in the House of Burgesses and the Council , was replaced by Hugh Drysdale , once Robert Walpole was convinced to act . 
 = = Modern view = = 
 Official views on pirates were sometimes quite different from those held by contemporary authors , who often described their subjects as despicable rogues of the sea . Privateers who became pirates were generally considered by the English government to be reserve naval forces , and were sometimes given active encouragement ; as far back as 1581 Francis Drake was knighted by Queen Elizabeth , when he returned to England from a round @-@ the @-@ world expedition with plunder worth an estimated £ 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 . Royal pardons were regularly issued , usually when England was on the verge of war , and the public 's opinion of pirates was often favourable , some considering them akin to patrons . Economist Peter Leeson believes that pirates were generally shrewd businessmen , far removed from the modern , romanticised view of them as murderous tyrants . After Woodes Rogers ' 1718 landing at New Providence and his ending of the pirate republic , however , piracy in the West Indies fell into terminal decline . With no easily accessible outlet to fence their stolen goods , pirates were reduced to a subsistence livelihood , and following almost a century of naval warfare between the British , French and Spanish — during which sailors could find easy employment — lone privateers found themselves outnumbered by the powerful ships employed by the British Empire to defend its merchant fleets . The popularity of the slave trade helped bring to an end the frontier condition of the West Indies and in these circumstances , piracy was no longer able to flourish as it once did . 
 Since the end of this so @-@ called golden age of piracy , Teach and his exploits have become the stuff of lore , inspiring books , films and even amusement park rides . Much of what is known about him can be sourced to Charles Johnson 's A General Historie of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates , published in Britain in 1724 . A recognised authority on the pirates of his time , Johnson 's descriptions of such figures as Anne Bonny and Mary Read were for years required reading for those interested in the subject . Readers were titillated by his stories and a second edition was quickly published , though author Angus Konstam suspects that Johnson 's entry on Blackbeard was " coloured a little to make a more sensational story . " A General Historie , though , is generally considered to be a reliable source . Johnson may have been an assumed alias . As Johnson 's accounts have been corroborated in personal and official dispatches , Lee ( 1974 ) considers that whoever he was , he had some access to official correspondence . Konstam speculates further , suggesting that Johnson may have been the English playwright Charles Johnson , the British publisher Charles Rivington , or the writer Daniel Defoe . In his 1951 work The Great Days of Piracy , author George Woodbury wrote that Johnson is " obviously a pseudonym " , continuing " one cannot help suspecting that he may have been a pirate himself . " 
 Despite his infamy , Teach was not the most successful of pirates . Henry Every retired a rich man , and Bartholomew Roberts took an estimated five times the amount Teach stole . Treasure hunters have long busied themselves searching for any trace of his rumoured hoard of gold and silver , but nothing found in the numerous sites explored along the east coast of the US has ever been connected to him . Some tales suggest that pirates often killed a prisoner on the spot where they buried their loot , and Teach is no exception in these stories , but that no finds have come to light is not exceptional ; buried pirate treasure is often considered a modern myth for which almost no supporting evidence exists . The available records include nothing to suggest that the burial of treasure was a common practice , except in the imaginations of the writers of fictional accounts such as Treasure Island . Such hoards would necessitate a wealthy owner , and their supposed existence ignores the command structure of a pirate vessel , in which the crew often served by free suffrage . The only pirate ever known to bury treasure was William Kidd ; the only treasure so far recovered from Teach 's exploits is that taken from the wreckage of what is presumed to be the Queen Anne 's Revenge , which was found in 1996 . As of 2009 more than 250 @,@ 000 artifacts have been recovered . A selection is on public display at the North Carolina Maritime Museum . 
 Various superstitious tales exist of Teach 's ghost . Unexplained lights at sea are often referred to as " Teach 's light " , and some recitals claim that the notorious pirate now roams the afterlife searching for his head , for fear that his friends , and the Devil , will not recognise him . A North Carolinian tale holds that Teach 's skull was used as the basis for a silver drinking chalice ; a local judge even claimed to have drunk from it one night in the 1930s . The name of Blackbeard has been attached to many local attractions , such as Charleston 's Blackbeard 's Cove . His name and persona have also featured heavily in literature . He is the main subject of Matilda Douglas 's fictional 1835 work Blackbeard : A page from the colonial history of Philadelphia . Gregory Keyes ' fictional The Age of Unreason has him appearing as the governor of a colony , and Tim Powers ' 1988 novel On Stranger Tides tells of his forming an alliance of pirates . Film renditions of his life include Blackbeard the Pirate ( 1952 ) , Blackbeard 's Ghost ( 1968 ) , Blackbeard : Terror at Sea ( 2005 ) , and the 2006 Hallmark Channel miniseries Blackbeard . Parallels have also been drawn between Johnson 's Blackbeard and the character of Captain Jack Sparrow in the 2003 adventure film , Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl . 
 = Almirante Latorre @-@ class battleship = 
 The Almirante Latorre class consisted of two super @-@ dreadnought battleships designed by the British company Armstrong Whitworth for the Chilean Navy . They were intended to be Chile 's entries to the South American dreadnought race , but both were purchased by the Royal Navy prior to completion for use in the First World War . Only one , Almirante Latorre ( HMS Canada ) , was finished as a battleship ; Almirante Cochrane ( HMS Eagle ) , was converted to an aircraft carrier . Under their Chilean names , they honored Admirals ( <unk> ) Juan José Latorre and Thomas Cochrane ; they took their British names from the dominion and a traditional ship name in the Royal Navy . 
 At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries , Chile was engaged in an intense naval competition with its neighbor Argentina . This ended peacefully in 1902 , but less than a decade later Argentina responded to Brazil 's order for two dreadnoughts with two of its own . The Chilean congress responded by allocating money for its own dreadnoughts , which were ordered from the United Kingdom despite a strong push from the American government for the contracts , probably due to Chile 's traditionally strong ties with the British . 
 Almirante Latorre , which was closer to completion than its sister , was bought in 1914 and commissioned into British service as HMS Canada in October 1915 . The ship spent its wartime service with the Grand Fleet , seeing action in the Battle of Jutland . After the war , HMS Canada was put into reserve before being sold back to Chile in 1920 as Almirante Latorre . The crew of the battleship instigated a naval mutiny in 1931 . After several years of inactivity , the ship underwent a major refit in the United Kingdom in 1937 , later allowing it to patrol Chile 's coast during the Second World War . After a boiler room fire and a short stint as a prison ship , Almirante Latorre was scrapped in 1959 . After Almirante Cochrane was purchased by the British in 1918 , it was decided to convert the ship into an aircraft carrier . After numerous delays , Almirante Cochrane was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Eagle in February 1924 . It served in the Mediterranean Fleet and on the China Station in the inter @-@ war period , and operated in the Atlantic and Mediterranean during the Second World War before being sunk in August 1942 during Operation Pedestal .

 = = = Argentine – Chilean boundary dispute = = = 
 Conflicting Argentine and Chilean claims to Patagonia , a geographic region in the southernmost portion of South America , went back to the 1840s . In 1872 and again in 1878 , Chilean warships seized merchant ships which had been licensed to operate in the disputed area by Argentina . An Argentine warship did the same to an American ship in 1877 . These actions nearly led to war in November 1878 , when Argentina dispatched a squadron of warships to the Santa Cruz River . Chile responded with the same , and war was only avoided when the Fierro – Sarratea treaty was hastily signed . Both countries were distracted in the next few years by Argentina 's internal military operations against the indigenous population and Chile 's War of the Pacific ( Guerra del Pacífico ) against Bolivia and Peru , but by 1890 a full @-@ fledged naval arms race was underway between the two . 
 Both sides began ordering warships from the United Kingdom . Chile added £ 3 @,@ 129 @,@ 500 in 1887 to the budget for its fleet , which was centered on two 1870s central battery ironclads , Almirante Cochrane and Blanco Encalada , and a protected cruiser . The battleship Capitán Prat , two protected cruisers , and two torpedo boats were ordered , and their keels were laid in 1890 . Argentina responded soon after with an order for two battleships , Independencia and Libertad . The race continued through the 1890s , even after the Chilean Civil War of 1891 . The two countries alternated cruiser orders between 1890 and 1895 , each ship marking a small increase in capabilities from the ship previous . The Argentines upped the ante in July 1895 by buying an armored cruiser , Garibaldi , from Italy . Chile responded by ordering its own armored cruiser , O 'Higgins , and six torpedo boats ; Argentina quickly ordered another cruiser from Italy and later bought two more . 
 The race abated somewhat after a boundary dispute in the Puna de Atacama region was successfully mediated by the American ambassador to Argentina , William Paine Lord , in 1899 , but more ships were ordered by Argentina and Chile in 1901 . Argentina ordered two Garibaldi @-@ class armored cruisers from Italy , and Chile replied with orders for two Constitución @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships . Argentina continued by signing letters of intent with Italian engineering company Ansaldo in May 1901 to buy two larger battleships . 
 The growing dispute disturbed the British government , who had extensive commercial interests in the area . Through their minister to Chile , they mediated negotiations between the two countries . These were successfully concluded on 28 May 1902 with three pacts , <unk> de Mayo . The third limited the naval armaments of both countries ; both were barred from acquiring any further warships for five years without giving the other an eighteen months ' advance notice . The United Kingdom purchased the two Chilean battleships , while Japan took over the order for the two Argentine armored cruisers ; the two Argentine battleships were never ordered . Two Argentine cruisers and Chile 's Capitán Prat were demilitarized . 
 Meanwhile , beginning in the late 1880s , Brazil 's navy fell into obsolescence after an 1889 revolution , which deposed Emperor Dom Pedro II , and an 1893 civil war . By the turn of the 20th century it was lagging behind the Chilean and Argentine navies in quality and total tonnage , despite Brazil having nearly three times the population of Argentina and almost five times the population of Chile . 
 = = = Dreadnought arms race = = = 
 By 1904 , Brazil — the largest country in South America in both size and population — began to seriously consider upgrading its navy , which had fallen to third in total tonnage . Soaring demand for coffee and rubber brought an influx of tax revenue , used to begin a large naval building plan . The centerpiece of the new navy would be two Minas Geraes @-@ class dreadnoughts built by the United Kingdom . The order for these powerful ships , designed to carry the heaviest armament in the world at the time , shocked Argentina and Chile , causing them to cancel the 1902 armament @-@ limiting pact with immediate effect . Alarmed , the American ambassador to Brazil sent a cablegram to his Department of State , warning them of the destabilizing effects that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race . 
 Argentina and other countries attempted to avert a full @-@ scale naval arms race by offering to purchase one of the two dreadnoughts . Brazil refused Argentina 's offer . After further tensions over the River Plate ( Río de la Plata , literally " Silver River " ) area and inflammatory newspaper editorials favoring dreadnoughts , Argentina went ahead with a massive naval building plan . After a drawn @-@ out bidding process among fifteen shipyards from the United States , Great Britain , Germany , France , and Italy , Argentina ordered two Rivadavia @-@ class dreadnoughts with an option for a third from the United States . They also ordered twelve destroyers from three nations in Europe . With its major rival acquiring so many modern vessels , Chile wanted to respond as early as February 1906 , but the country 's naval plans were delayed by a major earthquake in 1906 and a financial depression in 1907 brought on by a drastic fall in the nitrate market . 
 = = Bidding , construction , and sale to the British = = 
 On 6 July 1910 , the National Congress of Chile passed a bill allocating £ 400 @,@ 000 pounds sterling to the navy for six destroyers , two submarines , and two large battleships , later named Almirante Latorre and Almirante Cochrane . Even before the decision was officially announced , the United Kingdom was widely viewed as the only country with a chance of landing the contract . The Chilean Navy had enjoyed a long @-@ standing close relationship with its British counterpart , the Royal Navy , since the 1830s , when Chilean naval officers were given places on British ships to receive training and experience they could bring back to their country . This relationship had recently been cemented when a British naval mission was requested by Chile and sent in 1911 . 
 Still , the United States made a push to have the orders placed in an American shipyard . The American government sent Henry Prather Fletcher to be the new minister to Chile in September 1910 . Fletcher had successfully implemented President William Howard Taft 's " Dollar Diplomacy " policy in China . He met with resistance , which he attributed to lingering sentiment from the 1891 Baltimore Crisis : " My advances in the matter have not been met with frankness or encouragement and I feel a spirit of covert opposition . Under a very polite and courteous exterior there still exists a feeling of soreness towards us . " The US naval attaché opined that , barring anything short of a revolution , the contracts would be given to the British . Indeed , the bidding process specified ships very close to the armament and armor mounted on recent British warships . Fletcher asked for an extension to the bidding process so that American shipbuilding firms could tailor proposals to these requirements , and this was granted . 
 During this time , Germany announced plans to send the battlecruiser Von der Tann on a South American cruise . As the ship was " widely advertised as the fastest and most powerful warship then afloat , " the United States and United Kingdom felt its presence might give German companies an advantage in potential armament contracts , so they sent ships of their own . The United States sent the new battleship Delaware on a ten @-@ week excursion to Brazil and Chile , carrying the body of the recently deceased Chilean minister , Anibal Cruz , to the United States ; the British responded with an armored cruiser squadron . Delaware 's captain was ordered to give the Chileans full access to the vessel — the only exception being that he should not give full particulars of the new fire @-@ control system — in an attempt by the Navy Department " to aid the shipbuilding interests of the country [ United States ] to make contracts for the building of men @-@ of @-@ war for foreign countries . " As a further incentive , the US indicated its willingness to provide a $ 25 million loan to support the purchase of the ship . 
 In the event , the efforts made by the United States came to little . The final decision came down to a choice between the American and British tenders , and with a loan from the <unk> , Chile awarded one battleship contract to the latter 's Armstrong Whitworth on 25 July 1911 . The design was drawn up by J.R. Perret , who had also designed Brazil 's Rio de Janeiro . The United States still hoped that Chile would order American 14 @-@ inch / 50 caliber guns for the battleship 's main battery armament , but orders came only for coastal artillery . The second dreadnought was awarded to Armstrong in June 1912 . Six Almirante Lynch @-@ class destroyers were ordered in 1911 from J. Samuel White to accompany the new dreadnoughts . Before construction began , the Almirante Latorre design was enlarged to mount sixteen 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) rather than twenty @-@ two 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 119 mm ) guns . This increased the displacement by 600 long tons ( 610 t ) , to 28 @,@ 000 long tons ( 28 @,@ 449 t ) , the draft by 6 @.@ 5 inches ( 170 mm ) , to 33 feet ( 10 m ) , and made the ship a quarter @-@ knot slower , to 22 @.@ 75 knots . 
 Officially ordered on 2 November 1911 and laid down less than a month later on 27 November , the first dreadnought became the largest ship that Armstrong had built . The second dreadnought was ordered on 29 July 1912 and laid down on 22 January 1913 , delayed by Rio de Janeiro occupying the slipway in which it would be built . The New York Tribune ( 2 November 1913 ) and Proceedings ( May and June 1914 ) reported that Greece had reached an accord to purchase the first battleship counterbalance the Ottoman Empire 's acquisition of Rio de Janeiro from Brazil , but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell one or both of the dreadnoughts , no deal was made . 
 Almirante Latorre was launched first , on 27 November 1913 , in an elaborate ceremony that was attended by various dignitaries and presided over by Chile 's ambassador to the United Kingdom , Agustín Edwards Mac <unk> . The battleship was christened by the ambassador 's wife , Olga Budge de Edwards , and weighed 10 @,@ 700 long tons ( 10 @,@ 900 t ) at the time . After the First World War broke out in Europe , work on Almirante Latorre was halted in August 1914 , and it was formally purchased on 9 September after the British Cabinet recommended it four days earlier . Almirante Latorre was not forcibly seized like the Ottoman Reşadiye and Sultân Osmân @-@ ı Evvel ( ex @-@ Rio de Janeiro ) , two other ships being built for a foreign navy , because of Chile 's " friendly neutral " status with the United Kingdom . The former Chilean ship was completed on 30 September 1915 , and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 15 October . Work on the other ship , Almirante Cochrane , was halted after the outbreak of war . The British purchased it on 28 February 1918 to be converted to an aircraft carrier , as the partially completed ship was the only available large and fast hull capable of being modified into a full flush @-@ deck carrier . Low priority and quarrels with shipyard workers slowed completion of the ship . 
 = = Service histories = = 
 Almirante Latorre was renamed HMS Canada and slightly modified for British service . The ship completed fitting @-@ out on 20 September 1915 , and was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 15 October . It initially served with the 4th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet , and saw action in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916 . It fired 42 rounds from its 14 @-@ inch guns and 109 6 @-@ inch shells during the battle , and suffered no hits or casualties . Canada was transferred to the 1st Battle Squadron on 12 June 1916 , received further modifications in 1917 and 1918 , and was put into reserve in March 1919 . 
 After the end of the war in Europe , Chile began to seek additional ships to bolster its fleet , and the United Kingdom eagerly offered many of its surplus warships . This action worried the nations of South America , who feared that a Chilean attempt to regain the title of " the first naval power in South America " would destabilize the region and start another naval arms race . Chile asked for Almirante Cochrane in addition to Canada , but would not purchase the ship unless it was reconstructed into the original battleship configuration . The British halted work on the incomplete ship while seriously considering the offer in October 1919 . But because of the increased cost of reconverting her — £ 2 @.@ 5 million , compared to a potential profit of £ 1 @.@ 5 million from selling her — and a desire to test the aircraft carrier concept and especially the viability of island superstructures , the British kept and completed the ship , as HMS Eagle . 
 In April 1920 , Chile only bought Canada and four destroyers , all of which had been ordered by Chile prior to the war 's outbreak and requisitioned by the British for the war . Planned replacements for Almirante Cochrane included the two remaining Invincible @-@ class battlecruisers , but a leak to the press of the secret negotiations to acquire them caused an uproar . The most visible dissension came from a block of officers in the navy who publicly opposed any possible purchase and instead promoted a " New Navy " which would acquire submarines and airplanes . They argued that these weapons would cost less and give the country , and its lengthy coastline , better protection from external threats . The ships were not bought for reasons of cost , but neither were the airplanes its supporters had been hoping for . 
 = = = Almirante Latorre in Chilean service = = = 
 Canada was renamed Almirante Latorre once again and formally handed over to the Chilean government on 27 November 1920 . It departed Plymouth the same day with two of the destroyers , and they arrived in Chile on 20 February 1921 , where they were welcomed by Chile 's president , Arturo Alessandri . Almirante Latorre was made the flagship of the navy . The dreadnought was frequently used by Alessandri for various functions , including as transport to Vallenar after a 1922 earthquake , and to Talcahuano for the grand opening of a new naval drydock in 1924 . In 1925 , with the fall of the January Junta , the ship hosted Alessandri after his return from exile . In September , the last month of his term , Alessandri received the United Kingdom 's Edward , Prince of Wales , on board the battleship . 
 Almirante Latorre was sent to the United Kingdom for a modernization at the Devonport Dockyard in 1929 . It lasted for quite some time , but finally left for Valparaíso nearly two years later , on 5 March 1931 , and arrived on 12 April . Not long after it returned , crewmembers aboard Almirante Latorre instigated a major mutiny . The revolt was a result of the country 's economic woes in the midst of the Great Depression and a recent pay cut . Most of the navy 's ships joined Almirante Latorre in the mutiny , but they surrendered five days after it began when an air strike was mounted by government forces . Almirante Latorre ended up in the Bay of <unk> with Blanco Encalada . 
 With Chile still in the midst of the depression , Almirante Latorre was deactivated at Talcahuano in 1933 to lessen government expenditures , and only a caretaker crew was assigned to tend to the mothballed ship into the mid @-@ 1930s . Soon after Japan 's attack on Pearl Harbor , the United States approached Chile with the aim of purchasing Almirante Latorre , two destroyers , and a submarine tender to bolster the United States Navy , but the offer was declined . Almirante Latorre was used during the Second World War for Chilean neutrality patrols . The ship remained active until 1951 , when an accident in its engine room killed three crewmen . Moored at Talcahuano , the battleship became a storage facility for fuel oil . It was decommissioned in October 1958 , and was sold in February 1959 to be broken up for scrap in Japan . Almirante Latorre was taken under tow by the tug Cambrian <unk> on 29 May 1959 , and reached Yokohama , Japan , at the end of August , though the scrapping process did not begin immediately on arrival .

 Eagle was used for trials throughout 1920 . As the concept of aircraft carriers was still very new , the lessons learned were incorporated in a 1921 – 23 refit . Its official sea trials were conducted in September 1923 , and it was commissioned on 26 February 1924 . The new ship was sent to the Mediterranean Fleet in June , and alternated between refits in the United Kingdom ( 1926 , 1929 ) and the Mediterranean until 1931 , when Eagle was sent to show the flag on a South American cruise . Between its major refits in 1931 – 32 and 1936 , Eagle was sent to the China Station before rotating back to the Mediterranean . After 1936 , it was sent back to the Far East , and was there when the Second World War broke out in September 1939 . For the next seven months , Eagle was used for anti @-@ raider patrols , but when one of its own aircraft bombs exploded on board in March 1940 , the carrier was forced to sail to Singapore for repairs . Soon after , Eagle was again moved to the Mediterranean , where it protected convoys until May 1941 , when it was sent to Gibraltar . The ship spent the next several months in the South Atlantic , on guard against German raiders . 
 In September , a major fire severely damaged Eagle , so it was sent back to the United Kingdom . The refit lasted from October 1941 to February 1942 , and it was quickly sent to reinforce Force H. It was employed to ferry fighters to Malta in attempts to keep the besieged island under British control . As part of this duty , it was used to cover a convoy in August 1942 ( Operation Pedestal ) ; during the voyage , Eagle was sunk in four minutes by four torpedoes from the German submarine U @-@ 73 .

 Almirante Latorre closely resembled the British Iron Duke class , the major difference being that the Chilean ship was longer , had less forecastle but more quarterdeck , and had larger funnels along with an aft mast . The ship was 28 @,@ 100 long tons ( 28 @,@ 600 t ) standard and 31 @,@ 610 long tons ( 32 @,@ 120 t ) at full load . At 661 feet ( 201 m ) overall , it was 39 feet ( 12 m ) longer than the Iron Duke @-@ class ; it had a beam of 92 feet ( 28 m ) and a mean draft of 29 feet ( 8 @.@ 8 m ) . 
 The ship 's main battery was composed of ten 14 @-@ inch / 45 caliber guns mounted in five dual turrets . The arrangement was the same as for the Iron Duke class , with two turrets superfiring forward and a single turret amidships separated from the aft superfiring pair by superstructure and a mast . Built by the Elswick Ordnance Company , the guns were able to fire a 1 @,@ 586 @-@ pound ( 719 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1507 ft / s ( 764 m / s ) to a maximum range of 24 @,@ 400 yards ( 22 @,@ 300 m ) . They were able to depress to − 5 ° and elevate to 20 ° . Fourteen of these guns were manufactured , ten mounted on Almirante Latorre and four kept for use as spares . The latter were kept by the United Kingdom after the sale to Chile and scrapped in 1922 , while those built for Almirante Cochrane were at least originally kept for potential later use on Almirante Latorre . The secondary battery was originally composed of sixteen 6 @-@ inch Mark XI , two 3 @-@ inch 20 cwt anti @-@ aircraft guns , four 3 @-@ pounders , and four submerged 21 @-@ inch torpedo tubes . The two 6 @-@ inch guns located farthest aft were removed in 1916 , as they were affected by blast damage from the amidships 14 @-@ inch turret . During the 1929 refit in the United Kingdom , four additional anti @-@ aircraft guns were placed in the aft superstructure . 
 Almirante Latorre was powered by steam turbines manufactured by Brown – Curtis and Parsons , which put out 37 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower , and 21 Yarrow boilers . Together , these turned four propellers which drove the ship through the water at a maximum speed of 22 @.@ 75 knots ( 26 @.@ 18 mph ; 42 @.@ 13 km / h ) . 3 @,@ 300 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 200 long tons ) of coal and 520 metric tons ( 510 long tons ) of oil could be carried , giving the ship a maximum theoretical range of 4 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 100 mi ; 8 @,@ 100 km ) at 10 knots ( 12 mph ; 19 km / h ) . 
 The battleship 's armor was composed of a 9 @-@ to @-@ 4 @-@ inch ( 230 to 100 mm ) belt , 4 @.@ 5 @-@ to @-@ 3 @-@ inch ( 114 to 76 mm ) bulkheads , 10 @-@ to @-@ 4 @-@ inch ( 250 to 100 mm ) barbettes , 10 @-@ inch ( 250 mm ) turret faces , a 4 @-@ to @-@ 3 @-@ inch ( 102 to 76 mm ) turret roof , a 11 @-@ inch ( 280 mm ) conning tower , and 4 @-@ to @-@ 1 @-@ inch ( 102 to 25 mm ) armoured decks .

 = Daniel Faraday = 
 Dr. Daniel Faraday is a fictional character on the ABC television series Lost played by Jeremy Davies . Faraday is introduced in the Season 4 premiere as a physicist from the Queen 's College , University of Oxford . He suffers from short @-@ term memory loss , possibly due to his experiments with radioactivity . He is part of the team aboard the freighter Kahana that is offshore the island . Throughout his time on the series , Faraday plays an important role by sharing his knowledge of time travel . After time traveling to 1977 , Faraday is shot and killed by Eloise Hawking ( Alice Evans ) who is unaware that he is her son . 
 Jeremy Davies was cast in the role because of the " tremendous intelligence that seems to emanate from him " and was one of the writer @-@ producers ' favorite character actors . Davies was critically praised for his performance and critics were generally disappointed by the character 's death in season five . UGO.com named him one of the best TV nerds .

 = = = Background = = = 
 Daniel was born to Eloise Hawking ( Fionnula Flanagan ) and Charles Widmore ( Alan Dale ) , both of whom were Others . Eloise raised Daniel on her own , hiding the identity of his father from him and pushing him to develop a scientific mind , much to the detriment of his social life and casual pursuits . After graduating from the University of Oxford with his girlfriend Theresa Spencer , Daniel was offered a £ 1 @.@ 5 million grant by industrialist Charles Widmore . In the 1990s , Daniel started working as a physicist at The Queen 's College , Oxford , with controversial experiments including sending a subject 's consciousness through time . His initial tests on lab rats resulted in their deaths , which led to the abandonment of his studies . During his tenure , Daniel encountered Desmond Hume ( Henry Ian Cusick ) , who was suffering from temporal displacement trapping him between 1996 and 2004 . Daniel helped to ground Desmond 's consciousness by telling him to find a constant in both time frames , which Desmond decided was to be Penny ( Sonya Walger ) . This encounter had a profound effect on Daniel , reaffirming the legitimacy of his time @-@ displacement theories and prompted him to resume his abandoned experiments . Daniel eventually performed similar experiments on Theresa , but she ended up suffering from temporal displacement as Desmond had and eventually fell into a coma , with temporary periods of lucidity . 
 The funds for her continuing care were provided by Charles Widmore . As a result of Theresa 's fate , Oxford fired Daniel and quietly removed all references to him ever having been at the university . At some point , Daniel also performed an experiment upon himself , resulting in long @-@ term memory damage . While in Essex , Massachusetts , Daniel saw a news report covering the discovery of the apparent wreckage of Oceanic Flight 815 in the depths of the Sunda Trench . Widmore approached Daniel and after informing him that the Sunda Trench wreckage was a hoax , urged him to go to the island , which he said would heal him of his plight . At first , Daniel was reluctant , but Eloise convinced him to go . Daniel is then recruited into a covert team alongside Charlotte Lewis ( Rebecca Mader ) , Miles Straume ( Ken Leung ) and Frank Lapidus ( Jeff Fahey ) , which is organized by Matthew Abaddon ( Lance Reddick ) and led by Naomi Dorrit ( Marsha Thomason ) . Their mission was to travel to the island , find Ben Linus ( Michael Emerson ) , the then current leader of the Others , and disable the Dharma Initiative station called the Tempest , which contained poisonous gases . 
 = = = Season 4 = = = 
 Faraday first arrives on the island by parachuting out of a helicopter on December 23 , 2004 . After setting foot on the island , Faraday 's memory problem slowly diminishes . He then encounters the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 , who are believed to be dead by the world at large . On the island , Faraday starts conducting an experiment regarding the island 's unique passage of time . After reuniting with Charlotte , Faraday sneaks off with her to the Tempest Dharma Initiative station , where they neutralize a potential source of poison gas . Later , the corpse of the freighter 's doctor washes ashore . Jack Shephard ( Matthew Fox ) confronts Faraday and he is forced to confess that the freighter upon which they arrived was not sent to the island to rescue the survivors . Around this time , Daniel realizes the Secondary Protocol , detailing the whereabouts of Ben Linus , has been activated by Widmore , necessitating their immediate departure from the island . Faraday begins to ferry survivors to the freighter , but Charlotte and Miles choose to remain on the island . Daniel and five survivors are caught midway , between the Kahana and the island , when the Kahana blows up and the island is " moved " by Ben Linus . 
 = = = Season 5 = = = 
 When Ben causes the island to vanish , Charlotte , Faraday and the remaining survivors begin to travel through time . After the survivors are sent to the past , Faraday lures Desmond out of the Swan Dharma Initiative station , telling him to find Daniel 's mother once Desmond is off the island . Upon jumping further to the past , Faraday and the group are captured by the Others in 1954 . The Others mistake them for military personnel and Faraday is forced to disable a hydrogen bomb labelled " Jughead " . During this time period , he confesses his love for Charlotte . After telling the Others that they must bury the bomb , the survivors experience another time jump . The time jumps cause Charlotte to experience nosebleeds , headaches , and double vision , and she eventually collapses . As she dies , Charlotte tells Faraday she remembers living on the island as a child , and recognizes him as the man who told her not to return once she left the island . After John Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) stops the time jumps , the remaining survivors are stranded in 1974 . Faraday and his group move into the Barracks and under false pretenses , join the DHARMA Initiative . Despite the option to board the DHARMA submarine and " go back to the real world " , the survivors from 2004 stay on the island together in the hope that they can somehow return to the time that they knew and Faraday becomes a scientist for DHARMA . Faraday then leaves the island and joins the DHARMA headquarters in Ann Arbor , Michigan . 
 In 1977 , Daniel arrives back on the island and sets out to stop the construction of the Swan Station before drilling hits the electromagnetic " energy pocket " , which ultimately results in the crash of Flight 815 . Faraday plans to detonate the hydrogen bomb " Jughead " and destroy the unstable electromagnetic energy so no one would have to be pushing a button to save the world and Flight 815 would not crash . Before putting his plan into action , Daniel visits a young Charlotte , telling her never to return to the island once she leaves . Daniel then travels to the Others ' camp with Jack and Kate Austen ( Evangeline Lily ) to obtain the bomb . He breaks into their camp and threatens to shoot Richard Alpert ( Nestor Carbonell ) . However , he is shot by his mother , Eloise Hawking . Before Daniel dies , he tells Eloise he is her son and she sent him to the island despite knowing he would die . 
 = = = Afterlife = = = 
 In the afterlife , in which Oceanic Flight 815 does not crash on the Island , Faraday has a different background . Daniel was allowed to pursue his passion for music , and never trained in physics . After overhearing Eloise trying to persuade Desmond to stop pursuing Penelope ( Sonya Walger ) , Faraday approaches Desmond and shares his theory of the timeline being altered . He tells Desmond that he recently saw a red @-@ haired woman he strongly felt he already knew and loved . Daniel states after the encounter , he made a series of notes in his journal which a mathematician has identified as advanced quantum mechanics , a topic he knows nothing about . Daniel shows his notes , and hypothesises that the world as he and Desmond are experiencing is not their correct path . Faraday then tells him Penelope is his half @-@ sister and where Desmond can find her . Later , Faraday meets Charlotte at his benefit concert , but they do not yet realize they are in the afterlife . Daniel then takes the stage with <unk> to play as Charlotte watches from the crowd . It is later implied that both Eloise and Desmond are both aware that they are living in the afterlife . Eloise convinces Desmond to let Faraday live out the rest of his afterlife , since Faraday was never allowed to live the life he wanted in his past , and Eloise was never allowed to spend time with her son .

 After Naomi Dorrit ( Marsha Thomason ) landed on the island in season three , the producers began to plan who else would be on the boat she came from . They wanted these new characters to be interested in finding the island for their own personal reasons . During the casting of the " freighter folk " — the nickname that Lost 's producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse use to refer to Daniel , Charlotte , Miles and Frank — fake names , occupations and scenes were temporarily assigned , to limit the leak of spoilers . In the initial casting call , Daniel was referred as " brilliant mathematician " " Russell " . 
 Jeremy Davies was cast as Daniel because he was one of the writer @-@ producers ' favorite character actors , and they think that his " transformative quality [ and ] the tremendous intelligence that seems to emanate from him … seemed perfect for [ the part ] . " The producers constructed the role around Davies based on his performances in Rescue Dawn and Solaris . When Davies met costume designer Roland Sanchez , he was wearing a thin black tie . Sanchez merged this " cool , edgy look " with his idea for the character 's clothes : a " nerdy " loosely woven dress shirt from J.Crew. Davies reportedly took a " crash course " on physics to understand the character better . Showrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse called Daniel Faraday " an obvious shout @-@ out to Michael Faraday , scientist and physicist " . Faraday was originally planned to be a recurring role . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Producers Lindelof and Cuse were worried about how the new characters would be received by fans , after the unhappy reaction to new characters Nikki ( Kiele Sanchez ) and Paulo ( Rodrigo Santoro ) , introduced in season three . However , following their introduction in " Confirmed Dead " , the four characters were well received , with Paige Albiniak of the New York Post citing them as a reason behind the show 's improved ratings . IGN 's Chris Carabott described Daniel , as well as the other new characters from the freighter , as " great " and " exciting " . James Poniewozik of Time liked the introduction of the new characters from the freighter because " Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island , and yet by the end of the episode , [ he ] felt [ he ] had a true handle on what they were like as individuals " . Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called it the " perfect introduction " . Michael Ausiello of TV Guide also liked their introduction , and praised the actors ' performances . Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly liked that the " fascinating " new characters brought " mind @-@ blowing new possibilities , and exciting new theory fodder " . 
 Many critics praised Davies ’ s performance and appearance . Tom <unk> of The Daytona Beach News @-@ Journal deemed Jeremy Davies 's performance deserving of a Primetime Emmy Award . Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger claimed Davies 's performance to be " outstanding " . Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post said that Daniel " more and more becoming one of [ his ] favorite characters " . Chris Carabott wrote that Davies presents Faraday 's awkward mannerisms well . In a later review , Carabott commented , " I 've become a huge fan of Davies over the course of the last couple of years thanks to his performance on this show . " Rachel Dovey of Paste said " The Variable " revealed " a whole different " side of Daniel : " We 've oscillated before about the true nature of the physicist , whether it 's good or evil [ ... ] We decided he 's mostly a decent guy , barring the whole experimenting @-@ on @-@ his @-@ girlfriend @-@ then @-@ running @-@ away @-@ when @-@ her @-@ brain @-@ turned @-@ to @-@ mush thing . In the past , he 's just seemed lost and confused , and , since he has those big , earnest puppy eyes , we decided to forgive him . But the episode showed us the dynamic at the heart of Daniel 's stuttering vulnerability . Like all broken superheroes and Freudian beings , the man has mommy issues . This week we dove inside the dynamic between Daniel and his mother growing up . " Also , Adam Sweeney believed Davies 's acting was the " high point " of the episode . A reviewer for <unk> claimed he would have " loved any sort of explanation as to why [ Daniel ] changed his mind about changing the past or how he thought this could work . There must have been something that made Daniel think this was possible , but he was in such a rush that he never took care to explain . " 
 Critics expressed shock regarding Daniel ’ s death . David Oliver of CHUD.com felt " bummed " to see Daniel go . Dan Compora of Airlock Alpha also said the shooting of Daniel at the end was “ stunning . ” Jon Lachonis of TVOvermind claimed that as an internal character piece , " The Variable " was " not so much a great ending for Daniel . 
 Jeremy Davies submitted the episode " The Constant " on his behalf for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series . 
 = Blackadder Goes Forth = 
 Blackadder Goes Forth is the fourth and final series of the BBC sitcom Blackadder , written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton , which aired from 28 September to 2 November 1989 on BBC One . The series placed the recurring characters of Blackadder , Baldrick and George in a trench in Flanders during World War I , and followed their various doomed attempts to escape from the trenches to avoid certain death under the misguided command of General Melchett . The series is particularly noted for its criticism of the British Army leadership during the campaign , and also refers to a number of famous figures of the age . In addition , the series is remembered for the poignant ending of the final episode . 
 Despite initial concerns that the comedy series might <unk> the events of 1914 – 1918 , the series won widespread acclaim on its release , and won the British Academy Television Award for Best Comedy Series in 1989 . It has since become regarded as a classic television sitcom , and in 2000 was placed 16th by industry professionals in a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes compiled by the British Film Institute . However , some historians have criticized it for presenting an oversimplified view of the war , reinforcing the popular notion of " lions led by donkeys " . 
 = = Scenario = = 
 Blackadder Goes Forth is set in 1917 on the Western Front in the trenches of World War I. Captain Edmund Blackadder ( Rowan Atkinson ) is a professional soldier in the British Army who , until the outbreak of the Great War , has enjoyed a relatively action @-@ free existence fighting natives who were usually " two feet tall and armed with dried grass " . Finding himself trapped in the trenches with another " big push " planned , his concern is to avoid being sent over the top to certain death . The series thus chronicles Blackadder 's attempts to escape the trenches through various schemes , most of which fail due to bad fortune , misunderstandings and the general incompetence of his comrades . The aforementioned comrades are his second @-@ in @-@ command , idealistic upper @-@ class Edwardian twit Lieutenant George ( Hugh Laurie ) and their profoundly stupid but dogged batman Private S. Baldrick ( Tony Robinson ) . 
 Rather than the Germans , who remain generally unseen ( with the exception of " Private Plane " , where they are a means to escape the trenches ) , Blackadder 's nemeses come in the form of his superior , the eccentric General Melchett ( Stephen Fry ) who rallies his troops from a French château 35 miles ( 56 km ) from the front , and Melchett 's bureaucratic assistant , Captain Kevin Darling ( Tim McInnerny ) . Despite the two being of equal rank , Blackadder treats Darling with contempt — while the former is on the front line , the latter is " folding the general 's pyjamas " . Their animosity is mutual , largely as a result of Blackadder exploiting the comic potential of Darling 's surname at every opportunity . 
 = = = Themes = = = 
 Blackadder Goes Forth is more satirical in tone than the previous three Blackadder series and most sitcoms , taking the opportunity to present an anti @-@ war message . The dialogue is marked throughout by satirical musings about the nature of the war , its origins and the effects on the soldiers who suffered over its course . The fact that the soldiers suffered whilst their commanders remained safely distant from the action was also referenced on many occasions , such as when Melchett says to Baldrick , " Don 't you worry my boy , if you should falter , remember that Captain Darling and I are behind you ! " , to which Blackadder responds , " Yes , about 35 miles behind ! " . In the episode " Corporal Punishment " , Blackadder justifies the shooting for food of a carrier pigeon ( which turns out to be Melchett 's pet ) by saying , " With 50 @,@ 000 men killed a week , who 's going to miss a pigeon ? " This episode sees Blackadder being sentenced to death by firing squad for the act , reflecting on the harsh punishments dealt to deserters under the laws of war , and the dictatorship of higher ranking officers over those of lower ranking . 
 In " Private Plane " , after receiving word that Blackadder and Baldrick may have been killed when shot down over German lines , Melchett tries to cheer George up by showing him a life @-@ size model ( measuring seventeen square feet ) of land recaptured by the British , a commentary on the high human cost and small physical gains achieved by attacks in the middle years of the war . Later in the same episode , Blackadder describes the Great War as : " a war which would be a damn sight simpler if we just stayed in England and shot fifty thousand of our men a week . " 
 Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig , whose orders are alleged to have resulted in hundreds of thousands of British deaths at Passchendaele and the Somme , is continually referenced . Blackadder himself describes Haig 's attempts at an advance as no more than " another gargantuan effort to move his drinks cabinet six inches closer to Berlin " . In " Goodbyeee " , a scene parodies Haig 's professional abilities by depicting the Field Marshal playing with toy soldiers , which he sweeps nonchalantly from trench to trench and then into a rubbish bin , while listening to Blackadder 's plea to get out of the big push on the telephone . 
 The series recalls a number of famous historical events of the war , such as the Christmas truce of 1914 . Blackadder recalls the event : " Both sides advanced further during one Christmas piss @-@ up than they did in the next two and a half years of war . " References are also made to the popular culture of the era , as well as the previous series . The episode " Private Plane " , sees the return of the characters of Lord <unk> and Bob from the second series episode " Bells " and also an appearance of the famous flying ace Baron von Richthofen . A plot thread in the third episode " Major Star " involves Blackadder 's dislike of the silent film star Charlie Chaplin , whom he finds " as funny as getting an arrow through the neck , and then finding there 's a gas bill tied to it " . 
 In the fifth episode , the anti @-@ German sentiment in Britain during the war is repeatedly referenced . General Melchett orders Blackadder to find out what is behind the leak in top @-@ secret battle plans and immediately , though erroneously , pins it on a " German spy " ( who is later discovered to be inadvertently one of their own ) . Blackadder takes the chance to " interrogate " Captain Darling , who vehemently denies being a spy and says that he is " as British as Queen Victoria " , to which Blackadder sarcastically replies " So your father is German , you 're half German and you married a German ? " . Blackadder 's retort references the fact that Victoria was a member of the House of Hanover and that her husband was a prince from the House of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha . In 1917 , Victoria 's grandson King George V changed the royal house name from Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha to Windsor in an effort to appease British nationalist feelings . 
 The final episode of this series , " Goodbyeee " , although true to the series ' usual comedy style through most of the preceding scenes , is known for featuring a highly dramatic and extraordinarily poignant final scene , where the main characters ( except General Melchett himself ) are finally sent over the top . To the sound of a slow , minimal and downbeat piano version of the title theme , the four are seen in slow @-@ motion , charging into the fog and smoke of no man 's land , with gunfire and explosions all around , before the scene fades into footage of a sunny poppy field and the sound of birdsong . The fate of the four is left ambiguous . Blackadder 's final line before the charge is also underpinned with an unusually reflective and sentimental tone , offered after Baldrick claims to have one last cunning plan to save them from the impending doom :

 The series aired for six episodes broadcast on BBC One on Thursdays at 9.30pm between 28 September and 2 November 1989 , ending nine days before Remembrance Day . The titles of the first five episodes , " Captain Cook " , " Corporal Punishment " , " Major Star " , " Private Plane " and " General Hospital " are puns based on the pairing of a military rank and another word related to the episode 's content . The final episode , " Goodbyeee " , was the title of a period song .

 = = = Writing and rehearsals = = = 
 Writers Ben Elton and Richard Curtis wrote the scripts for Blackadder episodes separately using word processors and then swapped the disks containing the scripts for each other to add or remove jokes and dialogue . Curtis recalls that they stuck to a policy whereby if one removed a line for not being funny , then it was never put back . 
 During rehearsals , the script was exhaustively discussed and redrafted by the cast , with Richard Curtis having the final say on the content . Fry , Laurie and Atkinson were comic writers and performers themselves , and having worked together on previous series were not afraid to question the script and make suggestions . For example , Captain Darling was originally called " Captain Cartwright " and was renamed when Stephen Fry recalled a boy at his school with the surname " Darling " , who had found the name a constant embarrassment . Curtis recalls that he was initially reluctant to change the name , as he considered it a one @-@ off joke . 
 Speaking to The Times about the ending of the show in 1989 , Curtis hinted that the collaborative writing process caused tensions amongst the cast : " Everybody on the show thinks they can put in good jokes , despite the fact that Ben Elton and I think there are already quite a few good ones in there to start with . It does usually end up funnier , but it 's time to do something over which I have more control . " Twenty years on , Curtis recalled in the documentary Blackadder Rides Again that : " They would literally sit around for the entire time discussing the script ... sometimes we would just say to them " if you stood up and tried to act this script out , you would find out things about it . " Ben Elton stated that by opening it up , they allowed the cast to question every aspect of the script . 
 During Blackadder Rides Again , Tony Robinson likewise recalls that these script meetings could be uncomfortable , and has been less reserved speaking about the script rehearsals since . In an interview with The Daily Telegraph he suggests that although relations between the actors were generally cordial " There was bad feeling between the writers and the performers — the writers felt we were unilaterally altering the script and altering it for the worse . At end of the first day of rehearsals the writers would go away and by the time they came back we would have changed an awful lot of it . By the end , they felt we had run away with it . There were quite a lot of emotions flashing around about that . " 
 Producer John Lloyd , speaking to The Times in 1989 hinted that it was the draining scripting and rehearsal process that led to the writers deciding not to make another series : " Things do get very tense by the end of a series , because everyone involved in the thing is very clever , and very funny , and they all want to push the scripts along . It 's a very exhausting process , and by the end of it we all swear we 'll never , ever , do another one . But then you start to think how rare it is to get so many good people in the same room and you talk yourself into doing another series . " 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Rowan Atkinson and Tony Robinson reprised their roles as Edmund Blackadder and Baldrick respectively . Hugh Laurie also returned to play Lieutenant George . The fourth series enlarged the principal cast from the third series to include Stephen Fry as General Melchett and Tim McInnerny as Captain Kevin Darling , who had both appeared in guest roles in Blackadder the Third and had appeared regularly in Blackadder II . This cast appeared together in every episode of the fourth series , although the only episode to feature no guest appearances was " Captain Cook " . Miranda Richardson , who had played Elizabeth I in the second series , appeared in a guest role in one episode ( as she had in the third series ) . In their guest performances , actors such as Rik Mayall and Gabrielle Glaister reprised characters they had played in earlier series . Other performers , such as Bill Wallis and Lee <unk> , who had played minor roles in prior series , appeared briefly again in the fourth series as well .

 This series of Blackadder was one of the first television programmes in Britain to be made and transmitted with stereo sound , using the <unk> digital system , even though most viewers could only afford , or were only able to receive due to their location , the standard FM mono audio carrier signal . 
 The series was directed by Richard Boden and all interior scenes were shot at BBC Television Centre in front of a live studio audience . Rowan Atkinson recalls that the studio shooting could present him with problems : 
 That sitcom tradition is very strange when you 're performing to both a camera and an audience at the same time ... The thing that sometimes held us up is my stammer . Some words and some phrases did catch me out ... " B " s in particular . I remember one episode in which Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie were going " woof " a lot , and my line was " it 's like Battersea Dogs Home in here " . The B of Battersea was a problem for me . The floor manager suggested that I say " Crufts " instead . 
 Atkinson has said that in the buildup to the final episode , he began to psychologically experience something of his character 's apprehension . Speaking to Michael Parkinson in 2003 , he recalled " I remember ... in the weeks leading up to the one day recording of that final episode when we went over the top , for the first time in my acting career ... knowing that even though the rest of the episode was its usual standard funny sitcom self , there was this deep twist in my stomach throughout that week thinking along with your character that you were doomed . It was most peculiar . I 'm sure serious character actors feel this all the time ... Obviously if you 're trying to feel the character and his dilemma then you 're going to experience some of the fictional feelings for real . You felt swept along by it . " 
 Other than the title sequence , the series used little external shooting . To achieve the flying sequences in the episode " Private Plane " , footage from the 1976 film Aces High was re @-@ edited and dubbed over with the actors ' voices . The most challenging scene to shoot was the final " over the top " sequence , which was recorded in a separate studio set away from the audience which had been rigged with special effects to simulate a battlefield . 
 On viewing the original studio rushes for the 20th anniversary documentary Blackadder Rides Again , John Lloyd recalls that originally the final scene was " all very embarrassing " , as the actors only had 15 ft ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) to run before they reached the barbed wire in front of the camera , where they had to pretend to die , an effect described by Atkinson as " somewhat unconvincing " . It was only in post @-@ production that the final effect was achieved by running the video and audio in slow motion and fading another video of the empty set over the top to make it appear as if the characters had disappeared . This image of a barren landscape was then faded into a still image of a poppy field found in the BBC Picture Library . 
 = = = Titles and music = = = 
 The theme melody was a variation on the Blackadder theme by Howard Goodall over opening title images of Blackadder and George parading their men past Melchett and Darling , while Baldrick plays the triangle . The title music starts with the opening bars of " The British Grenadiers " before segueing into the familiar Blackadder theme . In the closing credits , the full Blackadder theme plays over visuals of armed men marching on a parade ground . The sequences were filmed and recorded on location at the former Colchester Cavalry Barracks , with the production using fifty members of the 3rd Battalion , the Royal Anglian Regiment to represent Blackadder 's men , attired in reproduction First World War uniforms , with the battalion 's band providing the music . 
 The titles are presented as static captions instead of being rolled as in the previous three series . The crew credits are presented in pseudo @-@ military fashion : for example , the designer is credited thus : " <unk> – <unk> Hull , C " . The opening sequence is filmed in colour , while the closing sequence was treated in post production to appear grainy , streaky , and sepia toned in imitation of newsreels of the era . 
 " Goodbyeee " has no closing titles , simply fading from the protagonists charging across no man 's land under fire , to a field of poppies in the sunlight , a reference to the poem " In Flanders Fields " and the flower 's symbolic significance . The music was also changed to a slow , echoey solo piano arrangement , finishing with three strong bass @-@ drum notes , interposed with sound effects of gunshot , and later birdsong . In the 25th anniversary special interview , Richard Curtis stated that the production team had not intended for such an ending and the idea of the scene fading to the poppy field was only conceived after some of the cast stated their reluctance in doing a second take .

 Emma Hanna , in her book The Great War on the Small Screen , has noted that some contemporary reviewers felt the topic of the First World War to be inappropriate for a comedy series , with one newspaper critic uncertain of the writers ' motives : " is [ the series ] justified in using tragic situations as a springboard for comedy merely for entertainment value ? " . Ben Elton 's uncle , the historian Geoffrey Elton , " was at first most unhappy at what he considered to be an insulting portrayal of the army " , although it is worth noting " he later took the view that the satire was drawn with great respect " . 
 Certainly , the issue of the series ' subject matter was of concern to the producers . Atkinson recalled in an interview with Michael Parkinson that the poignant ending of the final episode was in part written to counter the possibility of criticism that the subject was inappropriate for a comedy , although noted that the public accepted the series for what it was . Speaking during filming in 1989 , he remarked that despite the 20th century setting , the trenches were particularly apt for the Blackadder series : 
 We wanted a place and a time that could reproduce to a certain extent the claustrophobia and the <unk> of medieval England , and the best way to do that is to set it in the middle of a war . 
 Co @-@ writer Richard Curtis has said that before writing the series , the writers read a number of books about the war and decided that the First World War was a particularly apt subject for a situation comedy , finding that " actually , all the lead up to the first world war was very funny , all the people coming from communities where they 'd never bumped into posh people ... and all being so gung ho and optimistic ... the first hundred pages of any book about the world war are hilarious ; then of course everybody dies . " 
 Michael Brooke , assessing the series for the British Film Institute , suggests that the characterisation and pervading sense of danger prevented the sitcom from trivialising its subject matter : " The prospect of its characters suddenly dying a violent death provided a constant source of tension and gags , though when they really were killed off at the end of the final episode ... the result was so unexpectedly moving that the programme was later repeated as part of an otherwise wholly serious BBC2 Armistice Day programme without anyone batting an eyelid . "

 The series won the British Academy Television Award for Best Comedy Series in 1989 . In addition , for his performance as Captain Blackadder , Rowan Atkinson won Best Light Entertainment Performance . In 2000 , the series was placed 16th by industry professionals in a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes compiled by the British Film Institute . In 2004 , championed by John Sergeant , the whole Blackadder series came second in the BBC poll to find Britain 's Best Sitcom with 282 @,@ 106 votes .

 Academics have noted that the television series has become a pervasive view of the war in the public 's perception of World War I , with Max Hastings calling the common British view of the war " the Blackadder take on history . " Military historian Richard Holmes commented in his book The Western Front : " Blackadder 's aphorisms have become fact ... A well turned line of script can sometimes carry more weight than all the scholarly footnotes in the world . " Stephen Badsey , analysing trends in television programmes about the war remarked that Blackadder Goes Forth as a popular comedy series was subject to particular criticism from historians , remarking that the series " consciously traded on every cliche and <unk> piece of history about the Western Front , and was influential enough to draw a surprising degree of angry criticism from professional historians as a result . " 
 Esther MacCallum @-@ Stewart of Sussex University noted in her essay " Television <unk> @-@ Drama and The First World War " that " Blackadder Goes Forth is used as a teaching aid in schools ; not as a secondary text that should be analysed and discussed for its own reliability , but as a truthful parody of the conditions of the First World War . "

 Blackadder Goes Forth is available on a variety of BBC Worldwide @-@ distributed DVD and VHS video releases , either as an individual series or as part of a boxset with the other series of Blackadder .

" Going , Going , Gone " picks up about one month after the crash , and throughout the episode , features home videos of Sloan . The episode begins with Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital 's new interns , Dr. Shane Ross ( Gaius Charles ) , Dr. Jo Wilson ( Camilla Luddington ) , Dr. Heather Brookes ( Tina Majorino ) , and Dr. Stephanie Edwards ( Jerrika Hinton ) , expressing fear of Meredith Grey , who is now an attending general surgeon . It is revealed that former resident Dr. Alex Karev ( Justin Chambers ) will be pursuing a pediatric surgical fellowship at Johns Hopkins Hospital . The scene switches to Minnesota , where Yang is now a cardiothoracic surgical fellow . 
 Back in Seattle , Dr. Ben Warren ( Jason George ) surprises his fiancée Dr. Miranda Bailey ( Chandra Wilson ) with a visit . The couple reunites with constant sexual activity , for which the interns tease Bailey . Meanwhile , Dr. Callie Torres ( Sara Ramirez ) allows Shepherd to operate on a spinal cord , despite his hand being broken from the plane crash . Thereafter , it is revealed that Sloan is in a comatose state , and will be taken off of life support that evening . In the hospital cafeteria , Meredith Grey announces that Wilson will be given the honor of performing a supervised appendectomy , a procedure historically used as a reward for interns . The hospital 's chief of surgery , Dr. Owen Hunt ( Kevin McKidd ) , introduces the new pediatric surgery attending , Dr. Mel Barnett ( Philip Casnoff ) , to Torres and Karev . Barnett informs Karev that he will not be continuing with the African orphan charity program ( a function to treat ill children from Third World countries ) , something that was initially finalized by the latter and former chief of pediatric surgery , Robbins . Karev becomes upset about this , and asks Torres to prevent Barnett from discontinuing the program , though Torres shows no interest in helping Karev . 
 During Shepherd 's surgery , his hand becomes numb , and he frustratedly exits the operating room . In the intern appendectomy , Wilson makes a mistake and freezes , leading to a scolding from Meredith Grey . Back in Minnesota , Yang is annoyed by the peppy attitudes of her superiors at Mayo Clinic , Dr. Craig Thomas ( William Daniels ) and Dr. Parker ( Steven Culp ) , so she decides to take a trip to Seattle for Sloan 's death . However , her PTSD hinders her from boarding the plane , and she ultimately remains in Minnesota . Meanwhile , Dr. Jackson Avery ( Jesse Williams ) , now a plastic surgical fellow , sits by Sloan 's bedside and talks of medical cases to him . Dr. Richard Webber ( James Pickens , Jr . ) enters Sloan 's hospital room and removes him from life support . Unable to cope with Sloan 's death , Meredith Grey boards a plane to visit Yang , but panics before it takes off . Shortly thereafter , Meredith Grey finds Karev at the airport bar , where he reveals that he will be staying at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital . The next morning , Hunt visits Dr. April Kepner ( Sarah Drew ) at her family 's farm , and asks her to begin working in Seattle again . At the conclusion of the episode , Torres returns home to Robbins , who is revealed to have had her lower left leg amputated as a result of the crash .

Due to the unwanted release of spoilers , the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) requested that he delete the photo , and it was subsequently removed . The cast and crew of Grey 's Anatomy were being particularly quiet about the fate of Capshaw 's character . This secrecy was compromised when McKidd posted a picture on his Twitter account of the editing room , in which there was a picture of Robbins alive on the screen . The picture has since been taken down . 
 Discussing Robbins ' storyline in " Going , Going , Gone " , Capshaw revealed that she was " shocked " when it was made known to her that the character 's leg would be amputated . The actress additionally noted that it was difficult to keep the fate of her character a secret . Following the premiere , E ! Online reported that Dane 's death and departure in the premiere were results of budgetary cuts , mandated by ABC . Speaking of Sloan 's death , Rhimes said it was the " most tragic " , adding that " he 's part of the fabric of the show " . Rhimes wrote that anything other than the character dying would entail him leaving his daughter behind , something the writers did not want . However , she noted that the writing team considered having him move to Los Angeles to be with Dr. Addison Montgomery ( Kate Walsh ) after her departure from Private Practice , but they feared it would have given the impression that his love confession for Lexie Grey was forgotten .

 = Halloween II ( 2009 film ) = 
 Halloween II is a 2009 American slasher film written , directed , and produced by Rob Zombie . The film is a sequel to Zombie 's 2007 remake of 1978 's Halloween , and the tenth installment of the franchise . Picking up where the 2007 film ended , and then jumping ahead one year , Halloween II follows Laurie Strode as she deals with the aftermath of the previous film 's events , Dr. Loomis who is trying to capitalize on those events by publishing a new book that chronicles everything that happened , and Michael Myers as he continues his search for Laurie so that he can reunite with his sister . The film sees the return of lead cast members Malcolm McDowell , Scout Taylor @-@ Compton , and Tyler Mane , who portray Dr. Loomis , Laurie Strode , and Michael Myers in the 2007 film , respectively . 
 For Halloween II , Zombie decided to focus more on the connection between Laurie and Michael , and the idea they share similar psychological problems . Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor . For the characters of Halloween II , it is about change . Zombie wanted to look at how the events of the first film affected the characters . Zombie also wanted to show the connection between Laurie and Michael , and provide a glimpse into each character 's psyche . Filming primarily took place in Georgia , which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film . When it came time to provide a musical score , Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter 's original Halloween theme music . Although Carpenter 's theme was used throughout Zombie 's remake , the theme was only included in the final shot of this film . 
 Halloween II was officially released on August 28 , 2009 in North America , and was met with a negative reception from critics . On October 30 , 2009 it was re @-@ released in North America to coincide with the Halloween holiday weekend . The original opening of the film grossed less than the 2007 remake , with approximately $ 7 million . The film would go on to earn $ 33 @.@ 4 million in North America , and $ 5 @.@ 9 million in foreign countries giving the film a worldwide total of $ 39 @.@ 3 million . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In a flashback , Deborah Myers ( Sheri Moon Zombie ) visits her son , a young Michael Myers ( Chase Wright Vanek ) , at Smith 's Grove Sanitarium . She gives him a white horse statuette as a gift . Michael says that the horse reminds him of a dream he had of Deborah 's ghost , dressed in a white gown and leading a horse down the sanitarium halls toward Michael , telling him she was going to bring him home . Fifteen years later , after having shot an adult Michael ( Tyler Mane ) , Laurie Strode ( Scout Taylor @-@ Compton ) is found wandering around in a state of shock by Sheriff Brackett ( Brad Dourif ) , who takes Laurie to the emergency room . Meanwhile , the paramedics pick up the Sheriff 's daughter and Laurie 's friend Annie ( Danielle Harris ) and Michael 's psychiatrist Dr. Loomis ( Malcolm McDowell ) , who are still alive after having been attacked by Michael , and take them to the hospital . Presumed dead , Michael 's body is loaded into a separate ambulance . When the driver has a traffic accident , Michael awakens and escapes the ambulance , walking toward a vision of his mother dressed in white and leading a white horse . 
 Michael appears at the hospital , and begins murdering everyone he comes across on his way to Laurie . Trapped in a security outpost at the gate , Laurie watches as Michael tears through the walls with an axe , but just as he tries to kill her , Laurie wakes up from the dream . It is actually one year later and Laurie is now living with the Brackets . Michael has been missing since last Halloween — still presumed dead — and Laurie has been having recurring nightmares about the event . While Laurie deals with her trauma through therapy , Dr. Loomis has chosen to turn the event into an opportunity to write another book . Meanwhile , Michael has been having visions of Deborah 's ghost and a younger version of himself , who instructs him that with Halloween approaching it is time to bring Laurie home ; so he sets off for Haddonfield . 
 As Michael travels to Haddonfield , Laurie begins having hallucinations that mirror Michael 's , which involve a ghostly image of Deborah and a young Michael in a clown costume . In addition , her hallucinations also begin to include her acting out Michael 's murders , like envisioning herself taping Annie to a chair and slitting her throat while dressed in a clown outfit — similar to how a young Michael murdered Ronnie White . While Laurie struggles with her dreams , Loomis has been going on tour to promote his new book , only to be greeted with criticism from people who blame him for Michael 's actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael 's victims . When his book is released , Laurie discovers that she is really Angel Myers , Michael 's long lost sister . With the truth out , she decides to go to a party with Mya ( Brea Grant ) and Harley ( Angela <unk> ) to escape how she is feeling . Michael appears at the party and kills Harley , then makes his way over to the Brackett house and stabs Annie repeatedly . When Laurie and Mya arrive they find Annie bloodied and dying . Michael kills Mya and then comes after Laurie , who manages to escape the house . While Laurie manages to flag down a passing motorist , Sheriff Brackett arrives home and finds his daughter dead . Laurie gets into the motorist 's car , but before they can escape Michael kills the driver and flips the car over with Laurie still in it . Michael takes the unconscious Laurie to an abandoned shed he has been camping out in . Laurie awakens to a vision of Deborah , and a young Michael , ordering her to say " I love you , mommy " . 
 The police discover Michael 's location and surround the shed . Loomis arrives and goes into the shed to try to reason Michael into letting Laurie go . Inside , he has to inform Laurie , who believes that the younger Michael is holding her down , that no one is restraining her and that she must maintain her sanity . Just then , Deborah instructs the older Michael that it is time to go home , and Michael grabs Loomis and kills him by slashing his face and stabbing him in the chest . Stepping in front of a window while holding Loomis 's body , Michael is shot twice by Sheriff Brackett and falls into the spikes of some farming equipment . Apparently released from the visions , Laurie walks over and tells Michael she loves him , then stabs him repeatedly in the chest and finally in the face . The shed door opens and Laurie walks out , wearing Michael 's mask . As she pulls the mask off , the scene transitions to Laurie in isolation in a psychiatric ward , grinning as a vision of Deborah dressed in white stands with a white horse at the end of her room .

 In 2008 , at the 30 Years of Terror Convention , Halloween producer Malek Akkad confirmed that a sequel to Rob Zombie 's 2007 film was in the works . French filmmakers Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo were in negotiations to direct the sequel in November 2008 , but on December 15 , 2008 Variety reported that Rob Zombie had officially signed on to write and direct the Halloween sequel . In an interview , Zombie expressed how the exhaustion of creating the first Halloween made him not want to come back for a sequel , but after a year of cooling down he was more open to the idea . The writer / director explained that with the sequel he was no longer bound by a sense of needing to retain any " John Carpenter @-@ ness " , as he " felt free to do whatever " . Producer Malek Akkad said the original intention , when they believed Zombie was not returning , was to create a " normal sequel " . Akkad and his <unk> producing company hired various writers to come up with drafts for a new film , but none worked . Akkad and the Weinstein brothers then turned to Bustillo and <unk> , whose film Inside had recently been bought for distribution by the Weinstein Company . According to Akkad , the producers really wanted Zombie to return , as Akkad felt that there was something " lost in the translation " when the French filmmakers took over the project . After his work on the 2007 remake , Zombie had earned the trust of Akkad , who told him to ignore any rules they had set for him on the previous film . Akkad said that he wanted Zombie to move the franchise away from some of its established rules .

 For the sequel , Mane , McDowell , Taylor @-@ Compton , Harris , Moon Zombie , and Dourif returned to the roles of Michael Myers , Dr. Loomis , Laurie Strode , Annie Brackett , Deborah Myers , and Sheriff Brackett , respectively . Daeg Faerch , who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake , was set to reprise his role for Halloween II . By the time production was getting started for the sequel Faerch had grown too big for the part . Zombie had to recast the role , much to his own dismay , because Faerch 's physical maturity did not fit what was in the script . Although Faerch is not in the sequel , the first trailer for Halloween II contained images of Faerch . Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to be in either the trailer or the film . 
 Taylor @-@ Compton described her character as having " these bipolar moments " , where her emotions are spontaneously changing from points of happiness to agitation . The actress stated that Zombie wanted to see Laurie Strode travel into " these really dark places " . Taylor @-@ Compton clarified that when the film starts Laurie is still not aware that Michael is her older brother , and as the film progresses more and more pieces of information are given to her and she does not know how to deal with them . The actress explained that the darkness brewing inside Laurie is manifested externally , generally through her physical appearance and the clothes she chooses to wear — Zombie characterized the look as " grungy " . 
 Zombie further described Laurie as a " wreck " , who continually sinks lower as the film moves forward . Even Sheriff Brackett goes through changes . Brackett , who receives more screen time in this film , allows Laurie to move in with him and his daughter after the events of the first film . Zombie explained , " He 's old , he 's worn out , he 's just this beat @-@ down guy with these two girls he can 't deal with . " Zombie characterized Loomis in the sequel as more of a " sellout " , who exploits the memories of those who were killed by Michael in the 2007 film . Zombie explained that he tried to channel Vincent Bugliosi , a lawyer who prosecuted Charles Manson and then wrote a book about it , into Loomis 's character for the sequel ; noting that he wanted Loomis to seem more " ridiculous " this time . As for Michael Myers , the character is given almost an entirely new look for the film , which is being used , according to Taylor @-@ Compton , to illustrate a new emotion for the character as he spends much of his time trying to hide himself . Zombie said that of all of the characters that return in the sequel , Michael is the only one that does not change : " All the other characters are very different . Laurie ; Loomis ; they 're having all kinds of problems in their life , but Michael just moves along . Michael is no different ; he 's exactly the same as he was ten years old and he killed everybody [ ... ] He has no concept of the world around him , so he can never be affected by it . " 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 With a $ 15 million budget , production began on February 23 , 2009 in Atlanta , Georgia . Zombie acknowledged that filming in Georgia provided certain tax breaks for the company , but the real reason he chose that location was because the other locations he was planning to use were still experiencing snowy weather . For him , Georgia 's landscapes and locations provided the look that he wanted for his film . During production , Zombie described the sequel as being " Ultra gritty , ultra intense and very real " and said that he was trying to create almost the exact opposite of what people would expect . Known for filming multiple sequences during production of his films , Zombie filmed an alternate ending to Halloween II . In the alternate ending , Loomis and Michael crash through the shed the police have surrounded , and out into the open air . As Loomis grasps at Michael 's mask , and pleads for him to stop , Michael stabs him in the stomach , telling him to " Die ! " . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 For the sequel , Zombie only used Carpenter 's original theme music in the final scene of the film , though the director admits that he and music composer Tyler Bates tried to find other places to include it . According to Zombie , Carpenter 's music did not fit with what was happening in the film ; whenever he or Bates would insert it into a scene it " just wouldn 't feel right " to the director . Zombie also used popular culture songs throughout the film , with " Nights in White Satin " appearing the most prominently . Zombie chose songs that he liked , and that would enhance a given scene within the film . An official soundtrack for the film was released on August 25 , 2009 . In addition , an album featuring the music of psychobilly band Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures was released in conjunction with Halloween II on August 28 , 2009 . Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures is a fictional band that appears in Halloween II . Nan Vernon , who recorded a new version of the song " Mr. Sandman " for the end credits of the 2007 remake , recorded a cover of " Love Hurts " for Halloween II .

 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 Based on 73 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes , Halloween II has an overall 19 % approval rating from critics , with an average score of 3 @.@ 7 out of 10 , with the general consensus reading " Zombie shows flashes of vision in the follow @-@ up to his Halloween reboot , but they 're smothered by mountains of gore and hackneyed , brutal violence . " Rob Nelson , of Variety , felt the use of Deborah and the white horse was nothing more than " silly " , and he disagreed with Zombie 's choice to film Halloween II in 16mm film , as opposed to wider format of 35mm that he used on his 2007 remake . Nelson also stated that the hospital scene was nothing more than a " butcher " <unk> of Carpenter 's 1981 sequel , with the rest of the film feeling like it was rushed and " slapped together " at the last minute . In contrast , Time Out believed the hospital scene at the start of the film " [ bested the 1981 sequel ] in just about every respect " . Time Out stated that Compton 's portrayal of Laurie Strode showed an " intense , <unk> dedication to the role " that kept interest , while the storyline of Dr. Loomis 's <unk> hinders the overall storyline . Time Out also said that Zombie hurt the film by trying to show how " violence lingers with , and perverts , all who are touched by it " , but then undercutting himself with " carnivalesque " violence . Although the New York Post 's Kyle Smith did not believe the character of Laurie Strode was a balance for Michael Myers or Dr. Loomis , he agreed the ghostly images of Deborah Myers were a " relief from the blood @-@ streaked brutality " of Michael 's murders . 
 The Boston Globe 's Tom Russo had varied reactions to the film . Russo pointed out that Zombie attempted to be more inventive with Halloween II , but only achieved mixed results for his efforts . Russo referred to the dream sequences of Deborah Myers and the white horse as " pretentiously silly " , but agreed that the scenes did help to break up the standard genre violence and even went so far as to compare the sensation created by those scenes to " Tim Burton doing straight horror " . In the end , Russo claimed that " only the most hardcore fans " would want the film series to continue . Joe Neumaier , of the Daily News , stated that Zombie has found himself with Halloween II . Neumaier describes the film as a successful " ' character @-@ based ' monster @-@ flick " . Zombie 's use of music from the 1970s , like The Moody Blues ' " Nights in White Satin " and 10cc 's " The Things We Do for Love " , is " terrifically odd " throughout the film . Neumaier also said that the imagery of Deborah Myers and the " ethereal white horse " were a " nice visual relief " from Michael 's violent attacks .

 The 2014 National League Wild Card Game was a play @-@ in game during Major League Baseball 's ( MLB ) 2014 postseason played between the National League 's ( NL ) two wild card teams , the San Francisco Giants and the Pittsburgh Pirates . It was held at PNC Park in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , on October 1 , 2014 , starting at 8 : 07 p.m. EDT . After both teams finished the regular season with identical records of 88 – 74 , the Pirates were awarded home field for the game , as they won the season series against the Giants , four games to two . Despite this advantage , the Giants won by a score of 8 – 0 and advanced to play the Washington Nationals in the NL Division Series ( NLDS ) . In addition to being the third NL Wild Card Game played , it is notable for the first postseason grand slam hit by a shortstop . The game was televised on ESPN , and was also broadcast on ESPN Radio . 
 = = Background = = 
 In Major League Baseball , the two teams with the best record in each league who do not win a division play against each other in the Wild Card Game . This was the second postseason meeting between the Giants and Pirates – the two teams first met in the 1971 NL Championship Series , with the Pirates coming from behind to win three games to one after dropping Game 1 . The Giants ' most recent postseason appearance was in 2012 , when they swept the Detroit Tigers to win the World Series that year . On the other hand , the Pirates were able to advance to the playoffs in the previous season , marking the team 's first postseason appearance in 21 years . They lost three games to two in that year 's NLDS to the St. Louis Cardinals . 
 The first half of the 2014 season ended with both teams having three players on the NL squad for the 2014 Major League Baseball All @-@ Star Game . Madison Bumgarner , Tim Hudson , and Hunter Pence represented the Giants , while Josh Harrison , Andrew McCutchen , and Tony Watson represented the Pirates . During the second half of the season , there were several teams that were in contention for the two Wild Card spots , along with their divisional competition . These included the Atlanta Braves , Cincinnati Reds , and Miami Marlins , in addition to San Francisco and Pittsburgh . The Pirates performed poorly in August , and they lost seven consecutive games at one point . However , the team made a resurgence by winning 17 of the last 23 games of the regular season , surpassing San Francisco in the process for first place in the wild card standings . The Pirates secured their spot in the postseason on September 23 , while the Giants made it to the playoffs two days later . Both were the result of separate Brewers ' losses to Cincinnati . 
 With Pittsburgh 's postseason place secured , manager Clint Hurdle chose to start Gerrit Cole – the team 's ace – in the final game of the season against the Cincinnati Reds on September 28 , instead of skipping his turn in the rotation and saving his start for the Wild Card Game . This was done in an effort to beat the Cardinals to the NL Central division title , rather than settling for the wild card spot . The Pirates also needed to rely on the Arizona Diamondbacks – which finished with the worst record in the MLB at 64 – 98 ( .395 ) – to defeat St. Louis in order to force a tiebreaker . However , this did not come to fruition as the Cardinals narrowly won 1 – 0 over the D @-@ backs , while the Pirates lost 4 – 1 to Cincinnati . As a result of Cole starting in Sunday 's season finale , he was unable to pitch in the Wild Card Game on Wednesday . 
 = = The game = = 
 For the Wild Card Game , the Pirates started Edinson Volquez , who had a 13 – 7 win – loss record and 3 @.@ 04 earned run average ( ERA ) in 31 games started during the 2014 season . Hurdle picked him over the team 's other available starters – Francisco Liriano ( who would have been pitching on only three days ' rest ) and Jeff Locke , who pitched erratically throughout the year . The Giants selected left @-@ hander Madison Bumgarner , who had an 18 – 10 win – loss record and 2 @.@ 98 ERA during the season , as their starting pitcher . He was chosen over Jake Peavy , given the southpaw 's superior record on the road during the season ; Bumgarner compiled an 11 – 4 win – loss record with a 2 @.@ 22 ERA on the road , compared to a 7 – 6 record and 4 @.@ 03 ERA at AT & T Park . 
 The first third of the game was a tight scoreless pitcher 's duel between Volquez and Bumgarner , with the latter needing to throw just 28 pitches – the fewest number of pitches he has ever tossed in three consecutive innings of any game in his career . Only one batter – Giants ' third baseman Pablo Sandoval – was able to advance as far as second base during this time . The game remained tied until the fourth inning , when Volquez allowed two singles and a walk to load the bases . The subsequent batter , Brandon Crawford , hit a grand slam . This was the first grand slam hit by a shortstop in postseason history . Up until this point , players from all other positions in baseball – including pitcher – had hit postseason grand slams . Volquez pitched until the top of the sixth inning , when he gave up a walk and was replaced by Justin Wilson , who promptly threw a wild pitch . Wilson then allowed the inherited runner to score on a run batted in ( RBI ) single by Brandon Belt , who ended up driving in two more runs in the seventh inning with another single . The Giants added their final run of the game with an RBI single by Buster Posey in the top of the eighth . 
 The Pirates , who had struggled to score a run off Bumgarner throughout the entire game , came closest in the bottom of the eighth inning . With one out , they had runners at the corners after two errors and a single . He extinguished the threat by striking out Jordy Mercer and having reigning NL MVP Andrew McCutchen ground into a force out . Although Giants manager Bruce Bochy instructed closer Sergio Romo to warm up in the bullpen – in preparation of removing Bumgarner from the game – the starter insisted on continuing into the bottom of the ninth . He proceeded to pitch a perfect inning to finish the shutout , giving up four singles and one walk while striking out 10 during the complete game . In contrast , the entire Pirates ' lineup batted <unk> that night ; excluding Josh Harrison 's 2 @-@ for @-@ 4 performance , the rest of the team hit 2 @-@ for @-@ 28 ( <unk> ) .

 By winning the game , San Francisco secured the team 's seventh NLDS appearance in franchise history since the permanent implementation of the Division Series after the 1994 season . They also extended their record for most consecutive victories in postseason elimination games to seven . This tied the Kansas City Royals , who had just extended their record the night before . Bumgarner became just the third pitcher – after Sandy Koufax ( in the 1965 World Series ) and Justin Verlander ( in the 2012 American League Division Series ) – to pitch a shutout with at least 10 strikeouts in a deciding postseason game . 
 The Giants played the Washington Nationals in the NLDS . The second game of that series saw San Francisco win 2 – 1 after 18 innings . Lasting 6 hours and 23 minutes , it was the longest postseason game in history in terms of time elapsed , and was the joint @-@ longest in terms of innings ( tied with the 2005 NLDS game between the Houston Astros and the Braves ) . Although the Nationals won the next game against Bumgarner – ending the Giants ' NL record of 10 consecutive postseason games won – San Francisco triumphed in Game 4 to clinch the series 3 – 1 and advance to the NL Championship Series ( NLCS ) . 
 The NLCS was played between Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals in a rematch of the NLCS two years before . The Giants won the series 4 – 1 , attaining the NL pennant and advancing to the World Series for the third time in five years . They faced the Kansas City Royals in only the second Fall Classic played between two wild card teams , and the first since the 2002 World Series when San Francisco lost to the Anaheim Angels in seven games . The Giants won the series in seven games , becoming the second Wild Card team to win the World Series after being on the losing end in the first such series in 2002 .
