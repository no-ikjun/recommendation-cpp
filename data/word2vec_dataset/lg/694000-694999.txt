 A total of three thousand two hundred people attended the event . Canadian Online Explorer writer Jason Clevett rated the entire event a six out of ten , which was lower than the seven out of ten given to the 2007 Destination X event by Chris Sokol . Destination X 's rating was lower than TNA 's previous event Against All Odds , which was given a seven and a half out of ten . It was also lower than the six and a half given to TNA 's next event Lockdown . Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment 's WrestleMania XXIV PPV event held on March 30 , 2008 , Destination X was rated lower as WrestleMania was given a nine out of ten by Dale Plummer . The highest rating of Clevett 's review , an eight out of ten , was given to the Women 's Knockout Championship match and the Three Way Tag Team match . The Elevation X match received the lowest rating of the review with a zero out of ten . The main event was rated a five out of ten , while the Stand By Your Man Strap match was ranked a three out of ten . The Fish Market Street Fight was rated four out of ten . Clevett felt Destination X " was not a bad pay per view , " but " it wasn ’ t particularly good . " Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch , in his published review of the event , rated the main event three and one @-@ quarter stars out of five , the Elevation X match one star out of five , the Stand By Your Man Strap match one and one @-@ quarter stars out of five , and the Fish Market Street Fight two stars out of five . The Women 's Knockout Championship match and the main event were the highest rated matches in the review , with the Elevation X match the lowest . Keller thought the main event was a " good six @-@ man tag match , but it didn 't feel substantial enough to be a PPV main event . " Regrading the Elevation X match , Keller felt it was " pretty bad . " Commenting on the Stand By Your Man Strap match , Keller said it was a " letdown . " Remarking on the Women 's Knockout Championship match , Keller thought that " in some ways , just excellent " and that it was a " strong showing again by these women . " The event was released on DVD on May 13 , 2008 , by TNA Home Video .

 Following Destination X , Samoa Joe went on to Lockdown on April 13 , 2008 , to face Kurt Angle in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship . This match was announced on the March 13 , 2008 , episode of Impact ! by Management Director Jim Cornette . On the April 10 , 2008 , episode of Impact ! , a stipulation was added that if Joe lost he would retire from professional wrestling . At Lockdown , Joe defeated Angle to win the championship . 
 Christian Cage and Tomko were announced as the annual team captains in the 2008 Lethal Lockdown match by Cornette on the March 13 episode of Impact ! . Over the weeks leading up to the event the two picked their team members , ending up with Team Cage consisting of Cage , Rhino , Kevin Nash , Sting , and Matt Morgan , while Team Tomko was made up of Tomko , A.J. Styles , James Storm , and Team 3D ( Brother Devon and Brother Ray ) . At Lockdown , Team Cage defeated Team Tomko in a Five @-@ on @-@ Five Lethal Lockdown match . 
 With the return of Sharmell at Destination X , an Intergender Tag Team Six Sides of Steel Cage match was held at Lockdown , pitting Sharmell and Booker T against Payton Banks and Robert Roode . The bout was announced on the March 20 , 2008 , episode of Impact ! by Cornette . Sharmell and Booker were the victors in the contest at Lockdown , thus ending the feud between Booker T and Roode . 
 TNA X Division Champion Jay Lethal went on to defend the title in an Xscape match at Lockdown . The match was promoted on the March 13 episode of Impact ! , with qualifying matches held leading up to Lockdown . The wrestlers who qualified for the bout were Shark Boy , Curry Man , Johnny Devine , Sonjay Dutt , and Consequences Creed . Lethal ended up retaining the title at the event . Lethal eventually lost the title on the April 17 , 2008 , episode of Impact ! , when Petey Williams used his TNA X Division Feast of Fired Title shot . 
 LAX ( Hernandez and Homicide ) became number one contenders to the TNA World Tag Team Championship at Destination X. They were given their championship match on the April 17 episode of Impact ! , however at Lockdown the team of Eric Young and Kaz won a Cuffed in the Cage match earning them a championship match as well . Due to this , it became a Three Way Tag Team match between LAX , the team of Young and Kaz , and TNA World Tag Team Champions Styles and Tomko . Young and Kaz won the bout , however , due to a controversial finish the championship was vacated by Cornette . Cornette then set up the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament heading into TNA 's Sacrifice PPV event on May 11 , 2008 , to crown new champions . LAX went on to the event to win the tournament , thus winning the championship .

 = Chicago Spire = 
 The Chicago Spire was a supertall skyscraper project at 400 N. Lake Shore Drive in Chicago , Illinois that failed financially after beginning construction . When originally proposed as the Fordham Spire in July 2005 , the design had 116 stories and would have included a hotel and condominiums and been topped with a broadcast antenna mast . The design was by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava , and Chicago developer Christopher T. Carley of the Fordham Company was spearheading the project . On 16 March 2006 , the initial design of the building passed unanimously during that day 's meeting of the Chicago Plan Commission . A court ruling on 4 November 2014 brought to a close the original development plan and the extended litigation over the nine @-@ year @-@ old project ; developer Garrett Kelleher signed over the property location to the project 's biggest creditor , Related Midwest , who announced that they would not build the Spire .

 The building was originally proposed as the Fordham Spire in July 2005 ; Chicago developer Christopher T. Carley of the Fordham Company was spearheading the project . It was to have had 116 stories and to include a hotel and condominiums and be topped by a tall broadcast antenna mast . On March 16 , 2006 , the initial design of the building passed unanimously during that day 's meeting of the Chicago Plan Commission and on March 23 , 2006 , the same happened at the city 's Zoning Committee meeting . On March 29 , 2006 , the Chicago city council also approved that design . As part of the approval process , the council passed a measure that raised the height limit on structures at the site to accommodate the 2 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 610 m ) design height . It would have become the second tallest building in the entire world , surpassed only by the Burj Khalifa . It would have also surpassed the CN Tower to become the tallest freestanding structure and the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere . 
 The building was designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava and was being developed by St Patrick 's Athletic owner Garrett Kelleher of Shelbourne Development Group , Inc . 
 There was widespread support for the original design of the building among both the residents of the immediate neighborhood and the city of Chicago as a whole , partly because the building would block less sunlight and obscure less of the skyline than the lower buildings for which the land was originally zoned . Chicago Mayor Daley said he approved of the design , stating that it was environmentally friendly . Burton F. Natarus , who was the 42nd @-@ ward alderman when the building was announced , said : " This is a very unique opportunity for the city of Chicago . This building belongs to Chicago and should be in Chicago . " 
 Some opposition from neighborhood residents originated from concerns with increased congestion . Donald Trump immediately voiced opposition to the building , stating that the tall structure would be a target for terrorists and did not even seem to be a viable project . The opposing comment by Trump was made while he himself was developing a supertall tower in Chicago , the Trump International Hotel and Tower . Trump 's tower completed construction in January 2009 , just a few blocks west of the Chicago Spire site . If the Chicago Spire had been built as planned , it would have replaced the Trump International Hotel and Tower as the tallest residential structure in the United States , and the two towers would have been in direct competition in selling residential units .

 After several months of development in 2005 , Carley failed to obtain sufficient financing for the construction of the building . Irish developer Garrett Kelleher , executive chairman of Shelbourne Development Group , Inc . , acquired the land and took over the project . It was announced that he would put up 100 % of the equity , something Carley had been unable to do . He also had financial backing to acquire the land , something Carley lacked . Kelleher stated he would consider using Carley 's services on the development and that " Carley will be paid an unspecified sum for his involvement in the deal so far . " Kelleher later renamed the project " Chicago Spire " after shortly going by " 400 North Lake Shore Drive " , as it was no longer a Fordham project . 
 = = = New designs = = = 
 In the final quarter of 2006 , Shelbourne Development issued two separate press releases regarding the construction and design of the spire . A November 2006 press release stated that construction of the Chicago Spire would begin in June 2007 . In early December 2006 , Shelbourne Development issued another press release stating that the design of the building had been revised . This included the removal of the hotel and the antenna mast , making the building consist solely of condominium units . The design change altered the twist to be consolidated towards the base of the building , which was also wider than the original plan . Additionally , the spire no longer tapered at the top , resulting in an increase in floor space and overall floor count . The revision also removed the separate parking structure from the original plan , instead incorporating underground parking into the spire itself . This first major redesign of the Chicago Spire was criticized by architectural critics and city officials . 
 In late December 2006 , the Chicago Tribune reported that the developer was soliciting opinions on a further revision from community leaders . Several weeks following that report the Chicago Tribune held an exclusive interview with architect Santiago Calatrava and lead developer Garrett Kelleher . During the interview , Calatrava drew out design ideas restoring the rotating design of the building and showcasing his vision for the Chicago Spire 's lobby . On March 26 , 2007 , further revisions were shown during a public presentation by Shelbourne Development showcasing the most recent design . 
 = = = Approval = = = 
 Following the March 26 , 2007 public presentation by Shelbourne Development , residents showed favorable reaction to the newest design of the Chicago Spire . The Chicago Plan Commission approved the final plans of the Chicago Spire on April 19 , 2007 . Chicago 's zoning committee also approved the tower on April 26 and , on May 9 , 2007 , the Chicago City Council approved the final design of the Chicago Spire . 
 = = = Marketing = = = 
 By June 2008 , Shelbourne had sold more than 350 of the 1 @,@ 193 units — more than half of those to foreign investors in markets where certain United States Securities and Exchange Commission regulations do not apply . Shelbourne announced on September 30 , 2008 that the building 's penthouse had been sold to Beanie Babies manufacturer Ty Warner . Kelleher offered to rent out units at a guaranteed 7 @.@ 5 % return to spur sales . The approach is common outside the United States where the tower was marketed more heavily and was meant to spur sales of the smallest units , which are the most likely to be purchased as rental property investments by foreigners . 
 = = = Financial crisis and suspension of construction = = = 
 By October 2008 , the late @-@ 2000s recession was beginning to affect the project . Construction was suspended and the tower 's architect , Santiago Calatrava , placed an $ 11 @.@ 34 million lien on the construction site , stating that Kelleher had not yet paid him for his work . Within a few months Anglo Irish Bank , the primary lender for the project , was on the brink of financial collapse . The bank 's stocks had lost nearly all of their value and Anglo Irish Bank was facing nationalization . Due to the bank 's dire financial situation , Shelbourne Development was forced to suspend construction , and would eventually have to pay back the $ 69 @.@ 5 million ( USD ) it had already borrowed . 
 Additional litigation and liens threatened the project by autumn 2009 . The owner of the NBC Tower in Chicago sued to evict Shelbourne Development from their sales office , where extensive modeling of Chicago Spire units had been installed . The lawsuit alleged that Shelbourne was behind $ 316 @,@ 000 ( USD ) in lease payments . In addition to this and other liens listed on the property , Bank of America filed a lawsuit against Shelbourne Development for $ 4 @.@ 92 million ( USD ) . The lawsuit was an attempt to collect that sum on two unpaid loans used for initial construction at the Chicago Spire site . 
 After these setbacks , the AFL @-@ CIO and Kelleher announced in late 2009 that they were discussing the potential for a $ 170 million ( USD ) land loan that would retire Kelleher 's loan from Anglo Irish Bank , pay off the outstanding liens , and restart work in exchange for making the construction a completely union job . Due to the lack of construction and the sluggish economy , Chicago unions were desperate to find work for their employees as they faced near 30 % unemployment . Construction of the Chicago Spire would have provided approximately 900 full @-@ time jobs to union members for four years if construction had resumed . In addition to the $ 194 million ( USD ) that Kelleher has invested personally in the project already , backup financing of an unspecified amount and from an unknown source in the form of mezzanine capital and bridge loans has been guaranteed and would have kicked in automatically if the $ 170 million ( USD ) AFL @-@ CIO loan had been secured . 
 But within weeks of the official announcement that Kelleher was searching for union bailouts , four major labor union investment funds declined to offer Shelbourne Development any loans . Kelleher continued to search for financing . Shelbourne Development faced eviction from its offices on the 50th floor of 111 South Wacker Drive on which Shelbourne owed $ 27 @,@ 600 in unpaid rent . Earlier in the year , the spire 's Chicago sales office had been ejected from the nearby NBC Tower . 
 In October 2010 Anglo Irish Bank Corp. filed a $ 77 million foreclosure lawsuit against Kelleher , claiming that loans made to Kelleher ’ s development company had been in default for a year . The bank was expected to take possession of the site . By the end of the year , courts handed control of the site to a receiver , leaving the project ( at the time ) dead . In addition , two Chicago firms purchased the tax lien certificates on the property . 
 = = = Failure of reorganization plan and end of project = = = 
 In 2013 , with the Chicago Spire site for sale by Ireland 's National Asset Management Agency ( NAMA ) , interest resumed , drawing in at least a half @-@ dozen offers for the property . Under the involuntary bankruptcy ruling in October 2013 , Shelbourne had until the end of March 2014 to obtain approval of a reorganization plan , and was considering a bid to take back control of the property , reigniting hope that the skyscraper might actually be built . 
 In February 2014 , Shelbourne sought court approval to take up an offer of up to $ 135 million from Atlas Apartment Holdings intended to underpin the project 's emergence from bankruptcy , with a deadline of August 31 , 2014 for having a court @-@ approved reorganization plan . At a hearing on March 11 , 2014 , Shelbourne announced that it had reached agreement on a repayment plan with the project 's creditors , including Related Midwest , which had bought up much of the project 's debt . Assuming the project finds funding to satisfy that agreement , Atlas said that the building would be built and that Atlas would control the project , but that Kelleher would still be the developer , with the intention of building the same building planned prior to suspension of construction . 
 However , on October 31 , 2014 , the developer failed to make a required payment to Related Midwest and Related filed suit to compel Shelbourne to turn over the deed to the property . On 4 November 2014 , Garrett Kelleher signed over the property location at 400 N. Lake Shore Drive to Related Midwest . President Curt Bailey said that Related Midwest would not build the Spire . 
 = = Location = = 
 The skyscraper was being constructed at 400 N. Lake Shore Drive , on Chicago 's waterfront west of Navy Pier and northeast of the Loop , in the Streeterville neighborhood of the Near North Side community area . The site is at the junction of Lake Michigan and the Chicago River , and is bordered by the Ogden Slip of the Chicago River to the north , North Lake Shore Drive to the east , the Chicago River to the south , and existing residential property to the west . The site was originally zoned for two 35- to 50 @-@ story buildings . Originally , it was to be sold by a joint venture of LR Development Company of Chicago and <unk> Partners of Virginia for $ 64 million to Christopher Carley of the Fordham Company . After numerous short @-@ term extensions , and later Carley 's failure to obtain financing , Kelleher of Shelbourne Development purchased the land instead and pledged to finance the rest of the project . 
 = = = DuSable Park = = = 
 When the project was first announced , the Fordham Company pledged almost $ 500 @,@ 000 to assist in the development of the city 's proposed DuSable Park , which would adjoin the property of the Chicago Spire . DuSable Park would cover 3 @.@ 24 acres ( 1 @.@ 31 ha ) and a $ 11 @.@ 4 million budget was planned for its renovation . On March 26 , 2007 , Shelbourne pledged to pay $ 6 million toward the development of the park , making up the deficit left over from the city 's own initial pledge of $ 6 million and far exceeding the Fordham Co 's initial offer . In May 2007 Shelbourne 's pledge jumped to $ 9 @.@ 6 million . Soil tests performed in December 2000 on the soil of the proposed park showed contamination of radioactive thorium . Thorium was used by the Lindsay Light Company , which operated a location nearby . After the closing of the location in the 1930s , contaminated soil was dumped on the location of the proposed park . In March 2003 , the Chicago Park District stated that the thorium clean @-@ up on that land was incomplete . Hazards of contamination can be avoided by laying a minimum of 6 inches ( 15 cm ) of concrete over any affected soil , an approach that would be more feasible for the site of the Chicago Spire than for the adjacent park . 
 In 2012 the Chicago Park District received funding from the EPA for remediation of the site , bagging the radioactive soil and shipping it to a Superfund site . By Summer 2013 the Park District website reported the remediation had been completed by September 2012 
 = = Architecture = = 
 As with many of his designs , Calatrava was inspired by themes and designs in nature for the tall , twisting skyscraper . He likened the structure to an imaginary smoke spiral coming from a campfire near the Chicago River lit by Native Americans indigenous to the area , and also related the building 's newly designed pinnacle to the " graceful " and " rotating forms " of a snail shell . 
 Standing at 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) , the Chicago Spire would have further transformed the always @-@ growing Chicago skyline . Plans for the tower included 1 @,@ 193 condominiums with each of the building 's 150 stories rotated 2 @.@ 4 degrees from the one below it for a total 360 degree rotation . In February 2008 , prices for the condominiums were announced as ranging from $ 750 @,@ 000 to $ 40 million USD . For supplemental structural support , each floor was to be surrounded by cantilevered corners and four concave sides . Similar to the Willis Tower ( formerly Sears Tower ) and John Hancock Center observation decks , the Chicago Spire design included a community room on the top floor offering residents a view of four U.S. states . The design for the soaring four story lobby of the skyscraper included translucent glass walls framed by arching , steel @-@ reinforced concrete vaults . The building has been described as a giant " drill bit " by the public and others in the media have likened it to a " tall twisting tree " and a " blade of grass " . 
 The curved design offered two major benefits to the structure of the building . First , curved designs , such as that found in Calatrava 's Turning Torso in Malmö , Sweden , tend to add to the strength of a structure . A similar principle has been used in the past with curved stadium roofs . In addition to structural support , the curved face of the exterior would minimize wind forces . In rectangular buildings , a fluid wind flow puts pressure on the windward face of the building ; while air moves around it , a suction is applied to the leeward face . This often causes a sway in tall buildings usually counteracted , at least partially , by stiffening the structure or by using a dynamic wind damper . Since the curved design of the Chicago Spire would not completely negate wind forces , a tapering concrete core and twelve shear walls radiating from it were planned to counteract the remaining wind load . 
 Additionally , the Chicago Spire was designed with world @-@ class sustainable engineering practices to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold recognition . Sustainable features included recycled rainwater , river water used for cooling , <unk> @-@ sensitive glass to protect migratory birds , intelligent building and management systems , waste storage and recycling management , and monitored outdoor air delivery .

 Following the city approval , it was announced that construction of the Chicago Spire was to begin in summer 2007 , with caisson work scheduled to begin as early as June 2007 . DuSable Park was designated as a staging area for the construction of the tower . The sales center for the Chicago Spire opened on January 14 , 2008 . 
 On September 19 , 2008 , a spokeswoman for the developer announced that construction was continuing on the building , but that the pace of construction would be slowed until the financial markets recovered from the subprime mortgage crisis . Kelleher promised that he still had financial backing , although analysts questioned the ability of the project to survive the current economic decline . A contractor to build the building 's superstructure had not yet been named . The October 1 , 2008 edition of The Wall Street Journal said that the building foundation was complete and the above ground construction would not continue until the markets recover . 
 = = = Underground phase = = = 
 Crane parts and construction equipment arrived at the site on June 25 , 2007 . The following day Shelbourne Development officially announced the first construction contract . In preparation for construction , 34 concrete and steel caissons were drilled 120 feet ( 37 m ) into bedrock underground ; this was completed June 25 , 2008 . A cofferdam with a 104 feet ( 32 m ) diameter and 78 feet ( 24 m ) depth was installed to create a work environment and would have later acted as a foundation for the building 's core . Utility upgrades were planned for the surrounding neighborhood .

 = Fizeau – Foucault apparatus = 
 Fizeau – Foucault apparatus is a term sometimes used to refer to two types of instrument historically used to measure the speed of light . The conflation of the two instrument types arises in part because Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault had originally been friends and collaborators . They worked together on such projects as using the <unk> process to take images of the Sun between 1843 and 1845 and characterizing absorption bands in the infrared spectrum of sunlight in 1847 . 
 In 1834 , Charles Wheatstone developed a method of using a rapidly rotating mirror to study transient phenomena , and applied this method to measure the velocity of electricity in a wire and the duration of an electric spark . He communicated to François Arago the idea that his method could be adapted to a study of the speed of light . Arago expanded upon Wheatstone 's concept in an 1838 publication , emphasizing the possibility that a test of the relative speed of light in air versus water could be used to distinguish between the particle and wave theories of light . 
 In 1845 , Arago suggested to Fizeau and Foucault that they attempt to measure the speed of light . Sometime in 1849 , however , it appears that the two had a falling out , and they parted ways pursuing separate means of performing this experiment . In 1848 − 49 , Fizeau used , not a rotating mirror , but a toothed wheel apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in air . In 1850 , Fizeau and Foucault both used rotating mirror devices to perform relative measures of the speed of light in air versus water . Foucault used a scaled @-@ up version of the rotating mirror apparatus to perform an absolute measurement of the speed of light in 1862 . Subsequent experiments performed by Marie Alfred Cornu in 1872 – 76 and by Albert A. Michelson in 1877 – 1931 used improved versions of the toothed wheel and rotating mirror experiments to make steadily more accurate estimates of the speed of light . 
 = = Fizeau 's determination of the speed of light = = 
 In 1848 – 49 , Hippolyte Fizeau determined the speed of light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8 km distant . The light source was interrupted by a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second . ( Figure 1 ) Fizeau adjusted the rotation speed of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth . Spinning the cogwheel at 3 , 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the cogwheel teeth next in line . Given the rotational speed of the wheel and the distance between the wheel and the mirror , Fizeau was able to calculate a value of <unk> km / s for the speed of light . It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth , and his value for light 's speed was about 5 % too high . 
 The early @-@ to @-@ mid 1800s were a period of intense debate on the particle @-@ versus @-@ wave nature of light . Although the observation of the Arago spot in 1819 may seem to have settled the matter definitively in favor of Fresnel 's wave theory of light , various concerns continued to appear to be addressed more satisfactorily by Newton 's corpuscular theory . Arago had suggested in 1838 that a differential comparison of the speed of light in air versus water would serve to prove or disprove the wave nature of light . In 1850 , racing against Foucault to establish this point , Fizeau engaged L.F.C. Breguet to build a rotary @-@ mirror apparatus in which he split a beam of light into two beams , passing one through water while the other traveled through air . Beaten by Foucault by a mere seven weeks , he confirmed that the speed of light was greater as it traveled through air , validating the wave theory of light . 
 = = Foucault 's determination of the speed of light = = 
 In 1850 and in 1862 , Léon Foucault made improved determinations of the speed of light substituting a rotating mirror for Fizeau 's toothed wheel . ( Figure 2 ) The apparatus involves light from slit S reflecting off a rotating mirror R , forming an image of the slit on the distant stationary mirror M , which is then reflected back to reform an image of the original slit . If mirror R is stationary , then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror 's tilt . The situation is different , however , if R is in rapid rotation . 
 As the rotating mirror R will have moved slightly in the time it takes for the light to bounce from R to M and back , the light will be deflected away from the original source by a small angle . 
 As seen in Figure 3 , the displaced image of the source ( slit ) is at an angle <unk> from the source direction . 
 Guided by similar motivations as his former partner , Foucault in 1850 was more interested in settling the particle @-@ versus @-@ wave debate than in determining an accurate absolute value for the speed of light . Foucault measured the differential speed of light versus water by inserting a tube filled with water between the rotating mirror and the distant mirror . His experimental results , announced shortly before Fizeau announced his results on the same topic , were viewed as " driving the last nail in the coffin " of Newton 's corpuscle theory of light when it showed that light travels more slowly through water than through air . Newton had explained refraction as a pull of the medium upon the light , implying an increased speed of light in the medium . The corpuscular theory of light went into abeyance , completely overshadowed by wave theory . This state of affairs lasted until 1905 , when Einstein presented heuristic arguments that under various circumstances , such as when considering the photoelectric effect , light exhibits behaviors indicative of a particle nature . 
 In contrast to his 1850 measurement , Foucault 's 1862 measurement was aimed at obtaining an accurate absolute value for the speed of light , since his concern was to deduce an improved value for the astronomical unit . At the time , Foucault was working at the Paris Observatory under Urbain le Verrier . It was le Verrier 's belief , based on extensive celestial mechanics calculations , that the consensus value for the speed of light was perhaps 4 % too high . Technical limitations prevented Foucault from separating mirrors R and M by more than about 20 meters . Despite this limited path length , Foucault was able to measure the displacement of the slit image ( less than 1 mm ) with considerable accuracy . In addition , unlike the case with Fizeau 's experiment ( which required gauging the rotation rate of an adjustable @-@ speed toothed wheel ) , he could spin the mirror at a constant , <unk> determined speed . Foucault 's measurement confirmed le Verrier 's estimate . His 1862 figure for the speed of light ( <unk> km / s ) was within 0 @.@ 6 % of the modern value . 
 = = Cornu 's refinement of the Fizeau experiment = = 
 At the behest of the Paris Observatory under le Verrier , Marie Alfred Cornu repeated Fizeau 's 1848 toothed wheel measurement in a series of experiments in 1872 – 76 . The goal was to obtain a value for the speed of light accurate to one part in a thousand . Cornu 's equipment allowed him to monitor high orders of extinction , up to the 21st order . Instead of estimating the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth , a relatively inaccurate procedure , Cornu made pairs of observations on either side of the intensity minima , averaging the values obtained with the wheel spun clockwise and counterclockwise . An electric circuit recorded the wheel rotations on a <unk> chart which enabled precise rate comparisons against the observatory clock , and a telegraph key arrangement allowed Cornu to mark on this same chart the precise moments when he judged that an extinction had been entered or exited . His final experiment was run over a path nearly three times as long as that used by Fizeau , and yielded a figure of <unk> km / s that is within 0 @.@ 2 % of the modern value . 
 = = Michelson 's refinement of the Foucault experiment = = 
 It was seen in Figure 2 that Foucault placed the rotating mirror R as close as possible to lens L so as to maximize the distance between R and the slit S. As R rotates , an enlarged image of slit S sweeps across the face of the distant mirror M. The greater the distance RM , the more quickly that the image sweeps across mirror M and the less light is reflected back . Foucault could not increase the RM distance in his folded optical arrangement beyond about 20 meters without the image of the slit becoming too dim to accurately measure . 
 Between 1877 and 1931 , Albert A. Michelson made multiple measurements of the speed of light . His 1877 – 79 measurements were performed under the auspices of Simon Newcomb , who was also working on measuring the speed of light . Michelson 's setup incorporated several refinements on Foucault 's original arrangement . As seen in Figure 5 , Michelson placed the rotating mirror R near the principal focus of lens L ( i.e. the focal point given incident parallel rays of light ) . If the rotating mirror R were exactly at the principal focus , the moving image of the slit would remain upon the distant plane mirror M ( equal in diameter to lens L ) as long as the axis of the pencil of light remained on the lens , this being true regardless of the RM distance . Michelson was thus able to increase the RM distance to nearly 2000 feet . To achieve a reasonable value for the RS distance , Michelson used an extremely long focal length lens ( 150 feet ) and compromised on the design by placing R about 15 feet closer to L than the principal focus . This allowed an RS distance of between 28 @.@ 5 to 33 @.@ 3 feet . He used carefully calibrated tuning forks to monitor the rotation rate of the air @-@ turbine @-@ powered mirror R , and he would typically measure displacements of the slit image on the order of 115 mm . His 1879 figure for the speed of light , <unk> ± 51 km / s , was within about 0 @.@ 05 % of the modern value . His 1926 repeat of the experiment incorporated still further refinements such as the use of polygonal prism @-@ shaped rotating mirrors ( enabling a brighter image ) having from eight through sixteen facets and a 22 mile baseline surveyed to fractional parts @-@ per @-@ million accuracy .

 Long Distance is the third studio album by American band Ivy . It was released on November 8 , 2000 in Japan , while the US version was released on July 10 , 2001 by Nettwerk . Noted as a departure from Ivy 's previous studio album Apartment Life ( 1997 ) , the album took influence from new wave , but maintained Ivy 's signature blend of indie pop and indie rock music . Ivy collaborated with long @-@ time producer Peter Nashel for two of the album 's tracks , while the rest was completely produced and written by members Andy Chase and Adam Schlesinger . 
 Long Distance received positive reviews upon release , and is noted for its different new wave sound compared to Ivy 's previous works , Apartment Life and Realistic ( 1995 ) . Many critics favored Ivy 's new approach , although some found it less interesting compared to the material on Apartment Life . Commercially , the album fared well in both Japan and the United States , but did not peak on any significant record chart . 
 Four singles were released from the album . " Lucy Doesn 't Love You " , " Disappointed " and " I Think of You " were all commercially unsuccessful , while the album 's third single , " Edge of the Ocean " , appeared in numerous films and television programs and is often considered the band 's signature song . The songs " Undertow " and " Worry About You " were also used in the media , and the latter was used as the theme song for the ABC miniseries Kingdom Hospital . Promotional music videos were created for both " Lucy Doesn 't Love You " and " Edge of the Ocean " .

 Shortly after the release of Apartment Life ( 1997 ) , Ivy began work on a new studio album ; however , the band was dropped by their label , Epic Records , shortly after the reissue of Apartment Life was released . After the end of the contract with Epic , and lead singer Dominique Durand 's pregnancy , the New York City studio where Ivy regularly recorded music burned down . In order to forget about these events , Ivy resumed recording sessions , where they began incorporating influences from new wave . Member Adam Schlesinger detailed the album 's exploration of different genres : 
 " The first songs [ we ] recorded were jangly and simple and straight @-@ ahead . We started gravitating toward the groovier , slightly more melancholy stuff . It works well with Dominique 's voice . " 
 According to Schlesinger , Ivy then signed with Nettwerk because " their roster was similar to Ivy across the board " . After being released prematurely in Japan on November 8 , 2000 , the album was a quick success . Nettwerk 's head of marketing , Marie <unk> , stated that Long Distance became one of Amazon.com 's top imports . The album was released in the United States on July 10 , 2001 , eight months later . During recording sessions , Durand , Schlesinger and fellow band member Andy Chase decided " to go one @-@ hundred percent " on one of the tracks , which would later become " Edge of the Ocean " . Ivy stated that the song , which would later be released as the album 's third single , was created in hopes that it would " mean the difference between making our next album or not " . Along with " Edge of the Ocean " , the trio starting writing songs that were " less atmospheric " that those on Apartment Life , but contained more " infectious melodies " , which the band preferred .

 = = = Songs = = = 
 Long Distance opens with " Undertow " , a track featuring " pastoral tones " layered with " a lifting guitar frame " ; Tom Topkoff of Hybrid Magazine noted that Durand 's vocals have " aged like a fine wine " . The single " Disappointed " , the " fast @-@ paced " second track , consists of a " taut rhythm and slinky guitars " that " provide a sleekly sexy backdrop for Durand 's wistful vocals " . Its sound was compared to Ivy 's previous tracks on Realistic ( 1995 ) and Apartment Life ( 1997 ) , particularly the songs " No Guarantee " and " I Get the Message " . The next song , " Edge of the Ocean " , is an indie pop and trip hop song , and has been called a " captivating and escapist tune " . Since its release , it has been commonly referred to as one of Ivy 's signature songs , including by Ivy themselves . " Blame It on Yourself " is a " memorable " track , with instrumentation provided by distorted guitars . The fifth track , " While We 're in Love " , is a trip hop @-@ inspired track , with the singer and her partner realizing , " We know it won 't last forever / Because we 're not meant to be together " . " While We 're in Love " uses keyboards that add a groovy feeling to " fill out the sound more than ever before " . 
 The album 's lead single , " Lucy Doesn 't Love You " , uses 1960s @-@ style horns with " jangly guitars " to reintroduce Ivy 's signature indie pop style into the album . It has a " sassy brass and lifting melody " , accompanied by electric guitars to create an " atmospheric " mood . According to Tom Topkoff of Hybrid Magazine , " Worry About You " is Ivy 's " furthest departure from their tried and true practice " . The composition is relatively ambient , with " Portishead styled ethereal @-@ dub characteristics " . The album 's eighth song , " Let 's Stay Inside " , uses keyboard and acoustic guitar instrumentation to provide a " comforting " feeling ; " bossa nova @-@ tinged " , it results in an " intimate approach " . " Midnight Sun " and " I Think of You " both used violins and organs to achieve a sense of effortlessness , with the former 's instrumentation headed by Ivy 's longtime partner James Iha . 
 The next track , " Hideaway " , is another " escapist tune " , featuring " Durand 's sensually emotive vocals " . The album 's 12th track , " One More Last Kiss " , contains longing lyrics discussing Durand 's final moments with a lover . Its composition consists of guitar passages similar to the majority of the album . A cover of The Blow Monkeys ' " Digging Your Scene " concludes the standard edition of the album , with its production sounding " natural " , as if it was an original Ivy track . The Japanese edition of the album featured a bonus track , " It 's All in Your Mind " , which remains unreleased in the United States , and softly repeats the song 's title throughout . 
 = = Promotion = = 
 While Ivy did not heavily promote the album through live appearances , several tracks from Long Distance were featured in various television series and films . " Edge of the Ocean " was used in the movies Angel Eyes , Music and Lyrics and Shallow Hal , and the television series Grey 's Anatomy and Veronica Mars . " Worry About You " served as the theme song for the ABC drama series Kingdom Hospital , and was featured on the CBS sci @-@ fi series The 4400 , and its soundtrack . " Lucy Doesn 't Love You " was played in the similarly titled 2002 film I 'm With Lucy , while " One More Last Kiss " was in the 2002 movie Insomnia . 
 " Digging Your Scene " was released as a radio single and sent to modern rock radio in June 2001 . In 2002 , the single received a proper release to promote Ivy 's fourth studio album , <unk> . Ivy visited various record stores throughout the US and Japan to promote the album , including at Sam Goody locations and in West Village ; Ivy 's touring schedule coincided with the rereleased version of Apartment Life , on September 18 , 2001 .

 Ivy released four singles from Long Distance . In late 2000 , " Lucy Doesn 't Love You " was released as the album 's lead single . Two CD singles were issued in Japan , the first contained B @-@ side track " Blame It on Yourself " , while the second additionally contained " Digging Your Scene " . The track received favorable reviews from critics , and a music video was filmed in 2000 to promote the song . The album 's second single , " Disappointed " , was released as a radio single on July 10 , 2001 . Similarly , the track received positive feedback , and was promoted by an live performance on Late Night with Conan O 'Brien in 2001 . 
 Third single " Edge of the Ocean " was also released on July 10 , 2001 in the US . Compared to their previous work , the single was both a critical and commercial success , appearing in several television series and films , and peaking at No. 160 on the UK Singles Chart .

The album 's fourth and final single , " I Think of You " , was released on November 9 , 2001 .

 Long Distance received positive reviews upon release . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 68 , based on nine reviews . Jonathan Cohen from Billboard commented that " Durand 's sensual vocals are beguiling as ever " and favored singles " Disappointed " and " Edge of the Ocean " . A critic from Resonance magazine praised the album for " stay [ ing ] true to the belief that guitar pop can have cool , utopian sounds without bringing in a truckload of keyboards and sequencers " . A <unk> reviewer stated that " no one else stateside is currently making pop quite this lush and lovely " , but disapproved of the track " Undertow " for being " short of perfection " . One of E ! Online 's music critics declared " Lucy Doesn 't Love You " a summer anthem and predicted that Long Distance would increase Ivy 's popularity . 
 Critics from both Rolling Stone and Blender made strong comparisons between Long Distance and the English musical duo Everything but the Girl . The former stated that " any fan on Everything but the Girl , Saint Etienne or vintage Blondie should find plenty to swoon over " , while the latter called the sound " cloudy and distant , [ but ] takes tentative steps toward Everything but the Girl " . In a more mixed review , a critic from <unk> stated that " Ivy specialize [ s ] in <unk> oriented dream @-@ pop : too ethereal for straight pop fans , too structured for the 4AD crowd " . In a divided review , Michaelangelo Matos of City Pages noted that he preferred Ivy 's previous releases , but stated , " If your band had spent four years getting dropped and picked up and dropped again by record labels , you 'd sound tired too " . Similarly , a reviewer from Alternative Press was negative , expressing that " the 13 tracks here are improbably edgeless , all love @-@ me @-@ do / love @-@ me @-@ don 't <unk> that evaporate on impact " .

 <unk> ( Sanskrit ; Pali : Koṇḍañña ) also known as <unk> , Pali : <unk> Koṇḍañña ) was a Buddhist monk follower of Gautama Buddha and the first to become an <unk> . He lived during the 6th century BCE in what is now Uttar Pradesh and Bihar , India . 
 = = Life = = 
 <unk> was a brahmin who first came to prominence as a youth due to his mastery of the Vedas and was later appointed as a royal court scholar of King Suddhodana of the <unk> in Kapilavastu . There Koṇḍañña was the only scholar who unequivocally predicted upon the birth of Prince Siddhartha that the prince would become an enlightened Buddha , and vowed to become his disciple . Koṇḍañña and four colleagues followed Siddhartha in six years of ascetic practice , but abandoned him in disgust after Siddhartha gave up the practice of self @-@ mortification . Upon enlightenment , Siddartha gave his first dharma talk to Koṇḍañña 's group . Koṇḍañña was the first to comprehend the teaching and thus became the first bhikkhu and <unk> . 
 Koṇḍañña was regarded as the foremost of the five initial disciples of the Buddha and later travelled around India spreading the dharma . Among his notable converts was his nephew <unk> , who the Buddha acknowledged as the foremost preacher of the dharma . In his final years , he retreated to the Himalayas and predeceased the Buddha . 
 Koṇḍañña 's previous rebirths are described in many accounts in Buddhist literature . These accounts show that he had vowed in previous existences to be the first to comprehend the dharma when it was to be proclaimed by an enlightened Buddha . They also document that the seeds of his relationship with Gautama Buddha as the first <unk> were sown in previous existences in which they had crossed paths . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Koṇḍañña was born before the time of Siddhartha to a wealthy brahmin family in a town named in <unk> , near Kapilavastu , and was known by his family name . When he was growing up , he mastered the three Vedas at a young age and excelled in the science of physiognomy ( <unk> @-@ manta ) . 
 Koṇḍañña became a young Brahmin scholar in Kapilavastu in the Sakya kingdom of King Suddhodana . He was one among the group of scholars who were invited to the royal court to predict the destiny of Crown Prince Siddhartha at his naming ceremony . Siddhartha was the first child born to Suddhodana and Queen Maya in twenty years of marriage and much interest surrounded the infant from royal society and the public alike . All the other scholars raised two fingers and offered a twofold prediction : That Siddhartha would either become a Chakravarti ( supreme king ) or would renounce the world and become a supreme religious leader . Koṇḍañña was the only one that explicitly predicted that Siddhartha would renounce the world to become a Buddha , raising one finger and stating his prediction . 
 Koṇḍañña thereafter vowed that he would follow when Siddhartha became an ascetic to learn from the future Buddha 's findings . In the meantime , Suddhodana attempted to foil Koṇḍañña 's prediction because he wanted his son to succeed him in ruling and expanding the kingdom . Suddhodana made intricate arrangements to shield Siddhartha from all worldly suffering in order to steer his mind away from spiritual matters , pampering him with all the material luxury and sense pleasures that he could find . However , Siddhartha finally persuaded his father to allow him out of the palace to meet his subjects . Suddhodana agreed , but attempted to present a sanitised image of human existence by ordering beggars , old people and sick people to be kept from the streets . Despite this , Siddhartha saw the four sights which prompted him to reevaluate his view of the world . 
 = = <unk> and <unk> = = 
 When Siddhartha was aged 29 , he renounced the world to become a <unk> ( ascetic ) . Koṇḍañña , along with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , variously described as four of the other scholars who had read Siddhartha 's future or the sons of those scholars , followed him into the ascetic life , with the approval of Suddhodana , who was worried about Siddhartha 's safety . They were known as " the group of five " or " the group of five fortunate ones " . After Siddhartha had mastered all the teachings of Alara Kalama and then <unk> <unk> , he left and began practicing self mortification along with Koṇḍañña and his four colleagues at <unk> . Koṇḍañña and his colleagues attended to Siddhartha in the hope that he would become enlightened through self @-@ mortification . These involved self @-@ deprivation of food and water , and exposing themselves to the elements to near @-@ death for six years , at which point Siddhartha rejected self @-@ mortification . Koṇḍañña and his colleagues became disillusioned , believing Siddhartha to have become a glutton and moved away to Sarnath near Varanasi to continue their practices . 
 After Siddhartha became the enlightened Gautama Buddha , he sought to find his former teachers Arada Kalama and <unk> <unk> in order to teach them . Realising that they had died , the Buddha decided to find Koṇḍañña and his colleagues to share his teachings . Koṇḍañña and his companions were skeptical of Gautama Buddha after his abandonment of asceticism , and initially refused to acknowledge his presence , except to offer a seat on the ground . However , the ascetics were soon won over when they sensed that the Buddha had changed since they left him . The Buddha preached the <unk> Sutta , which deals with the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path , the core pillars of Buddhist teaching regarding the intrinsic suffering of existence and how to deal with it . Koṇḍañña reached the <unk> stage of <unk> upon hearing this , becoming the first human to comprehend the teachings . The Buddha acknowledged this by remarking " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( meaning " you have realised , <unk> " ) . 
 Five days later , hearing the subsequent <unk> Sutta regarding anatta , Koṇḍañña gained full <unk> . Koṇḍañña thus became first <unk> . Having realised <unk> , he requested the Buddha for permission to retire from the world , which was granted with the words " <unk> bhikkhu " . Koṇḍañña thus became the first bhikkhu ( monk ) in the Buddha 's dispensation , known as the sangha . Later , the assembly at Jetavana declared him to be the foremost among the first <unk> and the disciples of long standing . 
 = = After enlightenment = = 
 Following the emergence of the sangha , Koṇḍañña and the other monks travelled with the Buddha by foot through the Gangetic plains area of what is now Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to spread the dharma . Koṇḍañña helped to convert many followers to the Buddha 's teaching , the foremost being his nephew Punna , born to his sister <unk> . This occurred while the Buddha was at <unk> , where he had immediately gone after first communicating his Realisation in order to honour his promise to show his teachings to King <unk> . In the meantime , Koṇḍañña returned to his home town of Kapilavastu and ordained Punna . Punna attained <unk> and 500 of his clansmen become monks . Punna was later acknowledged by the Buddha as the foremost of the disciples in preaching skills . 
 As one of the senior monks of Gautama Buddha , some of Koṇḍañña 's writings and discourses to other monks are recorded in the literature . A poem consisting of sixteen verses in the <unk> is attributed to him . The first of these is said to have been recited by <unk> in praise of Koṇḍañña , after Koṇḍañña had preached the Four Noble Truths to <unk> . In other verses , Koṇḍañña is shown admonishing monks who had fallen into ways contrary to Buddhist teaching . Koṇḍañña also acknowledged his own struggles against Mara , the demon who attempted to prevent the enlightenment of the Buddha . Koṇḍañña was also praised in the Udana by the Buddha , who observed his deliverance from the destructiveness of craving . 
 After a period within the sangha , Koṇḍañña retired to the Himalayas for the last twelve years of his life . This is attributed to two reasons in Buddhist literature . The first reason was that Koṇḍañña considered his presence to be a source of inconvenience for <unk> and <unk> , the two chief disciples of The Buddha . As the <unk> member of the sangha , Koṇḍañña lead the monks on the alms @-@ round , but during dharma talks , the two chief disciples sat on either side of the Buddha and Koṇḍañña behind them . The two chief disciples were uncomfortable sitting in front of Koṇḍañña , so he decided to solve the problem by <unk> himself . The other reason to which Koṇḍañña 's leave is attributed was to spend more quiet time in religious practice , which was rendered difficult due to the attention that the sangha gained from the public . 
 According to the <unk> Nikaya , Koṇḍañña retired to the banks of the Mandakini Lake in the <unk> forest , said to be the abode of the <unk> . It was said that the 8000 elephants in the forest took turns to catering for his needs . Koṇḍañña only left once , to farewell Gautama Buddha . Koṇḍañña kissed the Buddha 's feet and stroked them with his hands . He advised his disciples not to mourn him before returning to the forest to pass away the following morning . He was cremated on a large sandalwood pyre which was constructed with the help of the elephants , and the ceremony was presided over by <unk> , one of the ten chief disciples and five hundred other monks . The ashes were later taken to <unk> , where they were enshrined in a silver stupa . 
 = = Previous and future rebirths = = 
 In line with the Buddhist doctrine of rebirth , the previous existences of Koṇḍañña are described in Buddhist texts . They repeatedly show a theme of Koṇḍañña having displayed religious inclinations in previous rebirths , many of which involve experiences with previous rebirths of the Buddha and his other leading disciplines . This is a common theme among the leading disciples , all of whom had many encounters with the future Gautama Buddha in previous lives , and is consistent with the Buddhist concepts of cause and effect and karma . In Pali language Theravada literature , Koṇḍañña is said to have begun striving for enlightenment in the time of Padumuttara Buddha , the 13th Buddha . The son of a wealthy householder at <unk> , Koṇḍañña saw the monk who was the first disciple of <unk> Buddha . Koṇḍañña 's previous rebirth bestowed on the Buddha and the sangha and wished that he was to be the first disciple of a future Buddha . Padumuttara is said to have prophesied the fulfilment of this in the era of Gautama Buddha , 1000 aeons into the future . After the passing of <unk> Buddha , Koṇḍañña constructed a jewelled chamber inside the <unk> in which the relics were stored and also made an offering of jewel festoons . The Apadana offers a variant on this reincarnation . It states that Koṇḍañña was the first person to offer a meal to Padumuttara and became a deva in the <unk> world . It further says and that during the time of <unk> Buddha , Koṇḍañña was a householder named Mahakala who offered the Buddha the first fruits of his field in their nine stages of production . The Mahavastu gives another account explaining the origin of Koṇḍañña 's vow to attain <unk> in his final rebirth . This account asserts that he was a potter at <unk> in a previous existence . A <unk> who was suffering from <unk> sought shelter in the potter 's hut and was cured . In time , several more <unk> came to visit the hut to inquire about their colleagues health status . The potter asked which of them had realised the dharma first , to which the patient answered in the affirmative . Thereupon the potter made his vow . 
 Despite the differences in the accounts , all of them agree on his words when announcing his vow : 
 By the merit I have acquired by doing this service of attending on you , may I be the first of all to realise the dharma when proclaimed by an Exalted One . May I not crave for gain and honour . May I wish only for a solitary bed and begging bowl . May I lay aside my body among the cascades and forest glades , dying all alone . 
 Numerous previous rebirths in which Koṇḍañña and Gautama Buddha crossed paths are also noted in Pali literature . The Mahavastu cites a previous birth in which Koṇḍañña was a seafaring merchant who had lost all his wealth after a mid @-@ ocean shipwreck . Koṇḍañña then went in search of the king of Kosala , who had a widely known reputation for philanthropy . However , the Kosalan monarch had left his kingdom and surrendered his kingdom to the neighbouring Kasi king . The king of Kosala had done so to avert bloodshed , since the Kasi king had threatened to invade . Nevertheless , the Kasi king wanted to capture the Kosalan king and decreed a large reward for it . The Kosalan king ( Gautama Buddha in a previous rebirth ) tied himself and asked the merchant to deliver him to Kasi so that the merchant would no longer be in poverty . However , when the Kasi king heard this , he withdrew his army and restored the Kosalan monarchy . The Kosalan king subsequently bestowed wealth on the merchant . Gautama Buddha cited this occurrence to illustrate how the ties between living beings extended into their previous existences . In another rebirth described in the Mahavastu , Koṇḍañña and his four colleagues who were to become the first <unk> were seafaring merchants under the command of the future Gautama Buddha . The future Buddha sacrificed himself to save them from an ocean death . The <unk> describes two further rebirths of Koṇḍañña . In one he was a bird named <unk> . In another , he was a tigress and Gautama Buddha another tiger . The future Buddha sacrificed his own life by offering himself as meat to the hungry tigress so that it would not eat its own cubs . 
 The " Five Hundred Disciples " ( eighth ) chapter of the Mahayana Lotus Sutra predicts that in the future he will become a Buddha named Universal Brightness . 
 = Echo & the Bunnymen ( album ) = 
 Echo & the Bunnymen is the fifth studio album by the English post @-@ punk band Echo & the Bunnymen , and the last with their drummer Pete de Freitas , who died in 1989 at age 27 in a motorcycle accident . The album was produced by Laurie Latham who recorded the album in Germany , Belgium , London and Liverpool after an aborted attempt at recording the album without de Freitas and with producer Gil Norton . With Latham being an exacting producer and singer Ian McCulloch receiving star treatment and drinking heavily , the recording of the album was more difficult than the band had initially hoped . The album made more use of keyboards than their previous albums , which had been string heavy . 
 Although Echo & the Bunnymen was successful in the United Kingdom and , to a lesser degree , the United States , it received mixed reviews from the music press following its release in July 1987 . The album reached number four on the UK Albums Chart , number 51 on the United States Billboard 200 , number 51 on the Canadian <unk> Albums and number 22 on the Swedish Albums Chart . Since its release , the album has been certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry . The album includes the singles " The Game " , " Lips Like Sugar " and " Bedbugs and Ballyhoo " . 
 = = Background = = 
 Echo & the Bunnymen took time off from touring , writing and recording after the release of the critically acclaimed Ocean Rain in 1984 , because the band 's manager , the fabled prankster Bill Drummond , felt that a year off would help the band write different kinds of songs in preparation for the next album . During the time off , drummer Pete de Freitas travelled Spain and France on his motorcycle , bass guitarist Les Pattinson worked on his new boat , singer Ian McCulloch released a solo single " September Song " , leaving guitarist Will Sergeant as the only band member to spend the time doing nothing . Even though the band enjoyed an excellent and creative working relation with Drummond , by the end of 1984 they had mutually parted company as the band were not making enough money . 
 Under the new management of Mick Hancock , Duran Duran 's tour manager , the band returned to work in May 1985 with a tour of Scandinavia . They also made a headline appearance at the Glastonbury Festival on 21 June 1985 , when they played live for the first time two new songs which would later be included on the album – " Satellite " and " All in Your Mind " . Now ready to start recording , they entered the studio with their former producer Ian Broudie and Clive Langer to record the songs they had played at Glastonbury as well as " Like a Rollercoaster " and " Jimmy Brown " . Not liking the results of this session , the band considered Eddy Grant and ABBA 's production team , before settling on Laurie Latham as their producer . McCulloch had been impressed by the sharp quality of Latham 's production on The Stranglers ' single " Skin Deep " . The band met with Latham in Brussels and recorded " All in Your Mind " , " Like a Rollercoaster " and " Jimmy Brown " , which was renamed " Bring on the Dancing Horses " . " Bring on the Dancing Horses " appeared on the WEA compilation album Songs to Learn & Sing in November 1985 and was released as a single in the same month . An early version of " Bedbugs and Ballyhoo " , a song that would appear on the album , appeared on the B @-@ side to the 12 @-@ inch version . 
 The band faced 1986 with a commitment to record an album , but without their drummer ; a musician who was considered fundamental to the band 's creative success . On 31 December 1985 , de Freitas had gone to New Orleans with the road crew on a drug binge and there announced his resignation from the band . The band then hired former Haircut One Hundred drummer Blair Cunningham for the spring 1986 tour of the United States ; but he didn 't fit in , and after the tour left to join The Pretenders . The band then hired former ABC drummer David Palmer , and recorded a few sessions with producer Gil Norton for the new album . However , by July 1986 Palmer had decided he did not want to remain with the band . As Palmer left the band , de Freitas returned to the United Kingdom and expressed a wish to rejoin . Uncertain of de Freitas 's commitment to the band , and his fragile mental state , they took him back as a hired hand rather than a full member . Now with the line @-@ up that would record Echo & the Bunnymen , the band gave a live television appearance for the BBC in September 1986 when they played two new songs , " The Game " and " Lips Like Sugar " . According to Will Sergeant , the band were under pressure from Warner Music chairman Rob Dickins to produce an album that would replicate the success of Peter Gabriel 's recent number one album So : " I couldn 't believe it when Rob Dickins brought us into his office and played us Peter Gabriel 's album : ' I want you to sound like this ! ' I think he escaped with his life that day . "

 Recording of the tracks that were to appear on Echo & the Bunnymen began at Conny Plank 's studio in Cologne . Both Echo & the Bunnymen and their label , WEA Records , were unhappy with the results of the Norton sessions with Palmer playing drums . Keen to record again with de Freitas , the band decided to scrap the Norton sessions and to start recording a new album with Latham who had previously worked with the band on their 1985 single " Bring on the Dancing Horses " . The sessions moved from Cologne to ICP Studios in Brussels before returning to Cologne and finishing off at The Workhouse in London and Amazon Studios in Liverpool . The band hoped that the album would be a collection of simple songs ; however , Latham was very specific and exacting , and he would work on one song for as long as a month . Recording was also complicated by the star treatment received by McCulloch . This , along with his heavy drinking , alienated him from the rest of the band . In a 1995 interview , band guitarist Will Sergeant said of McCulloch 's treatment , " We just found it all ridiculous . He had people running around behind him , basically wiping his arse . " McCulloch later said in a 1997 interview : " I knew I was losing it . I was on another planet but then I didn 't want to be on the one [ the other Bunnymen ] were on . " 
 While making the album , the band recorded a version of The Doors ' 1967 single " People Are Strange " for the soundtrack of the 1987 film The Lost Boys . Ray Manzarek , former keyboard player with The Doors , was brought in to provide keyboards on the song . While in the studio , he also contributed keyboards to a re @-@ recording of " Bedbugs and Ballyhoo " , which had previously been the B @-@ side to the 12 @-@ inch version of " Bring on the Dancing Horses " . Once Echo & the Bunnymen had been recorded the band 's management company , Direct Management , decided to have it mixed by Bruce <unk> in the United States . While the album was mixed , the band was on tour in Brazil and listened to the finished tracks over the phone . 
 Latham moved the band away from the use of strings , which featured heavily on Ocean Rain and to a lesser extent on Porcupine ( 1983 ) , and introduced keyboards to the melody of the tracks . De Freitas 's drumming was contained and discreet and McCulloch 's vocals were more restrained . Although the album contained hook @-@ heavy tracks such as " Lips Like Sugar " , the guitars on tracks such as " Lost and Found " are more representative of the album as a whole . 
 The resulting album was disliked by the entire band . Describing what he thought of as the over @-@ production of the album Sergeant described it as " an overcooked fish " in 1987 ; bass guitarist Les Pattinson said , " I like the songs , just hated the mixes " ; and in 1995 McCulloch said , " It still sounds crap . "

 After previewing the album with a short concert on top of the HMV shop on Oxford Street in London , Echo & the Bunnymen was first released on 6 July 1987 as an LP and CD by WEA Records in the United Kingdom and elsewhere and by Sire Records in the United States . The album reached a peak of number four on the UK Albums Chart . The album became the band 's most successful in the United States where it reached number fifty @-@ one on the Billboard 200 . The album also reached number fifty @-@ one on the Canadian <unk> Albums chart and number twenty @-@ two on the Swedish Albums Chart . The album has also been certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry for having shipped more than 60 @,@ 000 copies . Along with the other four of the band 's first five albums , Echo & the Bunnymen was remastered and reissued on CD in 2003 – these were released for the band 's twenty @-@ fifth anniversary . Seven bonus tracks were added to the album and included early versions of " Bring on the Dancing Horses " ( title " Jimmy Brown " ) , " The Game " and " Bedbugs and Ballyhoo " . Also included was a cover version of The Doors ' " Soul Kitchen " , an extended version of " Bring on the Dancing Horses " and the previously unreleased track " Hole in the Holy " . The reissued album was produced by Andy Zax and Bill Inglot and released by Rhino Entertainment . 
 In his 1987 review of the album for Rolling Stone magazine , music journalist J. D. Considine described Latham 's production of the album as " ineffectual " and " well mannered " . He went on say that there was no " anxious energy or knife @-@ edged irony that made the group 's earlier albums so compelling " . He finishes his review by saying the album is " as vacant as it is pretty " . Reviewing the 2003 remastered album , Andrew Harrison for Blender magazine 's website said , " <unk> and off @-@ message electronics experiments sank their eponymous 1987 comedown ... " Taking a more positive stance , David Cleary for AllMusic describes the album as " the hookiest and most memorable the band would ever write " . Having described de Freitas 's drumming as solid and veering toward the danceable , and McCulloch 's singing as " restrained and tasteful " , Cleary added that , " The production values were excellent , with many subtle touches that do not detract from the album 's overall directness . " Although he stated that the production " watered the band 's sound down " , Joe Tangari for Pitchfork Media said , " The band 's attempt to reach a wider audience worked out . " 
 Three tracks from the album were released as singles . The first of these was " The Game " , which was released on 1 June 1987 . This was followed by " Lips Like Sugar " , which was released in August 1987 . The final single to be released from the album was " Bedbugs and Ballyhoo " , which was also released before the year 's end in the United States and Germany . " The Game " and " Lips Like Sugar " reached numbers 28 and 36 respectively on the UK Singles Chart .

 Zvi Hecker ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> ; born May 31 , 1931 ) is a Polish @-@ born Israeli architect . His work is known for its emphasis on geometry and asymmetry . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Zvi Hecker was born as Tadeusz Hecker in Kraków , Poland . He grew up in Poland and Samarkand . He began his education in architecture at the Cracow University of Technology . He immigrated to Israel in 1950 . There he studied architecture at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology , graduating in 1955 . At the Technion , Eldar Sharon was a classmate , and Alfred Neumann was their professor . Between 1955 and 1957 , he studied painting at the Avni Institute of Art and Design , before beginning his career as an architect . Between 1957 and 1959 , Hecker served in the Combat Engineering Corps of the Israel Defense Forces . 
 = = Architectural career = = 
 After his military service , he founded a firm with Eldar Sharon ( until 1964 ) and Alfred Neumann ( until 1966 ) . The physical and economic conditions in Israel at the time , allowed them to complete a fair number of works in a relatively brief period of time , which brought international attention . Their joint works include the Mediterranean Sea Club in <unk> ( 1960 – 1961 ) , Dubiner House ( 1963 ) , the Chaim Laskov Officer Training School ( 1963 – 1967 ) <unk> 1 , the main officer training school of the Israel Defense Forces , just later the synagogue ( 1969 – 1971 ) at the same academy , and the Bat Yam city hall ( 1963 – 1969 ) . Their designs shared aspects in common with the <unk> movement , borrowing metaphoric shapes from nature for use in planning morphological structures . The modularity of these works , such as the Dubiner House , provided an architectural precedent for the Habitat 67 project by Moshe Safdie . 
 Hecker resides in Berlin and Tel Aviv . He has been involved in planning projects for the German Jewish community as well as other international projects . 
 = = Academic career = = 
 Hecker taught in Canada , the United States , Israel , and Austria at the Université Laval , University of Texas at Arlington , Washington University in St. Louis , Iowa State University , Technion – Israel Institute of Technology , and the University of Applied Arts Vienna . Zvi Hecker writes about his work periodically , co @-@ authoring books with Sir Peter Cook , John Hejduk , and others . 
 = = Projects = = 
 The early projects of Zvi Hecker , designed in partnership with Sharon and Neumann , have architectural qualities that were developed later in his career . The officer school ( <unk> 1 ) was built to give a respectable living environment to soldiers in the Negev desert , and special emphasis was given to the large spaces between the structures , in order to form a micro @-@ environment there , separating the people inside from the harsh desert outskirts . Raw concrete was chosen because it did not require constant maintenance and renovation in light of the strong sandy winds . About the school , Hecker said : " The location of the base has a special relevance to the vision of David Ben @-@ Gurion . To build such an important school in a place which isn 't the center of the country – in my opinion , that 's the positive side of the State of Israel " . The academy was supplemented later with a synagogue , whose form was complementary and contrasting . The Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture says of the architect 's approach to its design , " Eschewing the right angles of international modernism , he turned to crystalline geometry found in nature [ ... ] " 
 Another of the Zvi Hecker 's projects in partnership , the Bat Yam City Hall shows the recurrence of geometrical invention that exists throughout his work . One architectural significance of the Bat Yam City <unk> its formal concept , is that it is an inverted pyramid . It is linked to other works of architecture such as Boston City Hall through this form , in addition to their program , similar materials , and time period . The building is patterned on a diagonal grid with concrete , which provides both its structure and aesthetics . The importance of this building was recognized in 1975 with perspective and section illustrations on a postage stamp in the Architecture in Israel series . As of 2003 , Bat Yam City Hall was removed of its signature light shafts , rather than having them renovated . This was because of a perceived structural instability due to weathering over time . Of this removal Dr. Ami Ran wrote , " From an architectural standpoint , removing them is equivalent to dousing the Statue of Liberty 's torch . " 
 Among several projects for memorials , Zvi Hecker designed the solemn Page Memorial ( 1996 ) with Micha Ullmann and Eyal Weizman . This site @-@ specific memorial commemorates the Jewish community of Kreuzberg , and their <unk> synagogue which was designed in 1891 by architects Cremer & <unk> . What was once one of the largest religious buildings in Berlin , with a capacity of 1800 ; was ruined by the Nazis in the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom . On the original floor plan , the benches of the synagogue were recreated in concrete , and where the bimah stood , trees are now planted . The designers conceived of the benches as sentences on the pages of the Talmud . 
 = = Architectural style = = 
 Zvi Hecker architecture has continued to emphasize geometry and modularity , but with increasing asymmetry . Ramot <unk> ( 1972 – 75 ) is a rare prefabricated apartment complex with 720 non @-@ rectangular components . The apartments were expanded later , incorporating more cubic rather than pentagonal components . The design idea of this neighborhood may seem to be the more purely geometrical , however it is likened to a chemical structure , and in plan view to an open hand , and a leaf- therefore imparting it with metaphorical qualities . More examples of advanced geometry in Hecker 's work are the Spiral Apartment House in Ramat Gan , ( 1981 – 1989 ) , and the Heinz @-@ <unk> @-@ Schule ( 1992 – 1995 ) in Berlin , noted for their high degree of complexity . The Heinz @-@ <unk> @-@ Schule won Zvi Hecker the Deutscher <unk> in <unk> it was stated that the decision of the jury was based on their appreciation of the " expressive geometry of his construction . " The Spiral Apartment House is located adjacent to his earlier Dubiner house , providing a juxtaposition of two important moments in his career . The work of Zvi Hecker has been compared to that of Antonio Gaudi , for expressiveness and expanding of architectural ideas . 
 More of his later works are the Jewish community center in Duisburg ( 1996 – 1999 ) , and with Rafi Segal , the Palmach Museum in Tel Aviv ( 1995 – 2000 ) . The Duisburg Jewish community center is located on a park , the Garten der Erinnerung designed by Dani Karavan . The community center shares a similar concept to the Page Memorial in its likening to the open pages of a book , and symbolically the Torah of Moses . The Palmach Museum has an angular zig @-@ zag plan positioned around the preservation of trees on the site . It is clad in a local sandstone that was found in excavations for the project . It was exhibited at the Venice Biennale .

 Hecker was the subject of a solo exhibition at the Israel Museum in 1976 . He had solo exhibitions at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in the 1980s and in 1996 . He also took part in the Jewish Identity in Contemporary Architecture at the Jewish Museum Berlin in 2005 , and has participated in the Venice Biennale on a number of occasions . 
 = Split Agreement = 
 The Split Agreement or Split Declaration ( Bosnian and Croatian : <unk> sporazum or <unk> deklaracija ) was a mutual defence agreement between Croatia , the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina , signed in Split , Croatia on 22 July 1995 . It called on the Croatian Army ( HV ) to intervene militarily in Bosnia and Herzegovina , primarily in relieving the siege of Bihać . 
 The Split Agreement was a turning point in the Bosnian War as well as an important factor in the Croatian War of Independence . It led to a large @-@ scale deployment of the HV in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the capture of strategic positions in Operation Summer ' 95 . This in turn allowed the quick capture of Knin , the capital of the Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) , and the lifting of the siege of Bihać soon thereafter , during Operation Storm . Subsequent HV offensives in Bosnia and Herzegovina , supported by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( ARBiH ) and the Croatian Defence Council ( HVO ) , as well as NATO air campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina , shifted the military balance in the Bosnian War , contributing to the start of peace talks , leading to the Dayton Agreement . 
 = = Background = = 
 In November 1994 , the Siege of Bihać entered a critical stage as the Army of the Republika Srpska ( VRS ) — the Bosnian Serb military — and forces of the Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) ( an unrecognized state established following the Serb insurrection in Croatia ) came close to capturing the Bosnian town . Bihać was a UN @-@ designated " safe area " , controlled by the 5th Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( ARBiH ) , supported by the Croatian Defence Council ( HVO ) — the main military force of the Bosnian Croats . It was thought that the capture of Bihać by Serb forces would escalate the war and worsen a growing rift between the United States , France and the United Kingdom , with the U.S. and European powers advocating different approaches to preservation of the area . In addition , it was feared that Bihać would turn into the worst humanitarian disaster of the war . Furthermore , denying Bihać to the RSK or Republika Srpska was strategically important to Croatia , which was fighting the Croatian War of Independence against the RSK . The Chief of the Croatian General Staff Janko Bobetko thought that the possible fall of Bihać would represent the end of Croatia 's war effort . It was considered that if the area were captured by Serb forces , it would allow for the consolidation of the territory held by Serb forces in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina , as well as redeployment of RSK and VRS troops to reinforce other areas . 
 In a meeting of the Croatian and US Governments and military officials held on 29 November 1994 , the Croatian representatives proposed an attack on Serb @-@ held territory from Livno in Bosnia and Herzegovina , in order to draw off part of the forces besieging Bihać and to prevent its capture by the Serbs . The U.S. officials gave no response to the proposal and Operation Winter ' 94 was ordered the same day . Besides contributing to the defence of Bihać , the attack advanced positions held by the HV and the HVO nearer to supply routes vital to the RSK . 
 The meeting was one in a series held in Zagreb and Washington , D.C. following the March 1994 Washington Agreement . The agreement ended the Croat – Bosniak War , re @-@ allied the ARBiH and the HVO against the VRS and provided Croatia with US military advisors from the Military Professional Resources Incorporated ( MPRI ) . MPRI was hired because a UN arms embargo was still in place , ostensibly to prepare the HV for NATO Partnership for Peace programme participation . The organization trained HV officers and personnel for 14 weeks from January to April 1995 . It was also speculated that the MPRI also provided doctrinal advice , scenario planning and US government satellite information to Croatia . MPRI and Croatian officials dismissed such speculation . In November 1994 , the US unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina , in effect allowing the HV to supply itself as arms shipments entered through Croatia . The US involvement reflected a new military strategy endorsed by President Bill Clinton since February 1993 . 
 = = Call for Croatian intervention = = 
 On 17 July , the militaries of the RSK and the VRS started a fresh effort to capture Bihać by expanding on gains made during Operation Spider . The offensive , codenamed Operation Sword ' 95 , aimed to capture Cazin — a transportation route hub , situated in the centre of the ARBiH / HVO @-@ controlled Bihać pocket . The attack was spearheaded by the RSK Special Units Corps and supported by the " <unk> " ( Spider ) operational group of the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia ( APWB ) forces — who had been RSK allies since 1993 — advancing from the northwest , with the RSK 39th Banija Corps from the northeast and the VRS 2nd Krajina Corps from the southeast . The effort was also supported by about 500 Yugoslav Army special forces and Željko Ražnatović Arkan 's Serb Volunteer Guard — for a total of about 19 @,@ 000 attacking or sector @-@ holding troops arrayed against the ARBiH 5th Corps . By 21 July , the RSK troops managed a 7 @-@ kilometre ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) breakthrough , but failed to sever the Bihać – Cazin road . A renewed push by the RSK and APWB troops four days later brought their forces within 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 miles ) of Cazin and put them in control or in favourable positions to strike several key passes and dominant points of the battlefield by 26 July . The ARBiH 5th Corps was left in a critical defensive situation , dependent on outside help . 
 As the situation around Bihać deteriorated for the ARBiH , the government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina realized that it could not hold the area on its own and asked Croatia for military intervention . ARBiH Chief of Staff <unk> Delić appealed to the HV and the HVO to assist the ARBiH 5th Corps on 20 July , proposing HV attacks towards Bosansko Grahovo , Knin and Vojnić . His plea was supported by President of Turkey Süleyman Demirel when he met Croatian President Franjo Tuđman in the Brijuni Islands the next day . 
 This led to signing of the Split Agreement — a mutual defence agreement — by Tuđman and the President of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , Alija Izetbegović in Split on 22 July , permitting large @-@ scale deployments of the HV in Bosnia and Herzegovina . Besides Tuđman and Izetbegović , the agreement was signed by President of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Krešimir <unk> , and the Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina Haris <unk> . It was mediated by Demirel . The agreement specifically stated that Croatia requested urgent military aid , especially for the Bihać area , and that the parties to the agreement intended to coordinate their military activities . The full title of the Split Agreement , or Split Declaration , is Declaration on implementation of the Washington Agreement , joint defence against Serb aggression and achievement of a political solution in accordance with the efforts of the international community ( <unk> o <unk> <unk> iz <unk> , <unk> <unk> od <unk> <unk> i <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . The US Ambassador to Croatia , Peter Galbraith , and a German ambassador , representing the European Union , were present at the signing ceremony . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The agreement provided the HV with the opportunity to extend its territorial gains from Operation Winter ' 94 by advancing from the Livanjsko field . The move was expected to relieve pressure on the ARBiH 5th Corps defending Bihać , while positioning the HV in a more favourable position to strike Knin , the RSK capital . The HV and HVO responded quickly through Operation Summer ' 95 ( Ljeto ' 95 ) . The offensive , commanded by HV Lieutenant General Ante Gotovina , succeeded in capturing Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč on 28 – 29 July . The attack drew off some RSK units away from Bihać , but not as many as expected at the outset of the operation . Nevertheless , the offensive put the HV in an excellent position , as it isolated Knin from Republika Srpska and FR Yugoslavia , and led to the capture of Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč , which sat astride the only direct route between the two . 
 Regardless of the limited scope of Operation Summer ' 95 , the Split Agreement became a fundamental instrument to change the overall strategic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina where Bosnian Serbs had had the upper hand since the beginning of the Bosnian war , as well as in Croatia , where the front lines had been largely static since the 1992 Sarajevo armistice . As Operation Summer ' 95 concluded , the RSK and Republika Srpska changed their priority from smashing the Bihać pocket to fending off a possible Croatian offensive to capture Knin ( advancing from the recently gained territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina ) . RSK leaders Milan Martić and Mile Mrkšić agreed with UN Special Representative Yasushi Akashi to withdraw from the Bihać area on 30 July , hoping the move would contribute to averting the Croatian attack . Albeit , the attack materialized days later as Operation Storm , a decisive victory to the HV in the Croatian War of Independence . 
 Success of Operation Storm also represented a strategic victory in the Bosnian War as it lifted the siege of Bihać , and allowed Croatian and Bosnian leaderships to plan a full @-@ scale military intervention in the VRS @-@ held Banja Luka area , based on the Split Agreement — aimed at creating a new balance of power in Bosnia and Herzegovina , a buffer zone along the Croatian border , and contributing to the resolution of the war . In September 1995 , the intervention came about as Operation Mistral 2 , supported by the ARBiH offensive Operation Sana , combined with a NATO air campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina . The offensives broke the VRS defences and captured large swathes of territory . The feat was repeated in Operation Southern Move ( Operacija <unk> <unk> ) carried out in October , advancing within 25 kilometres ( 16 miles ) of Banja Luka , and contributing to the start of peace talks that would result in the Dayton Agreement soon thereafter . Overall , deployment of the HV based on the Split Agreement , proved decisive in the defeat of the VRS in the Bosnian War . 
 = Benedict Arnold = 
 Benedict Arnold ( January 14 , 1741 [ O.S. January 3 , 1740 ] – June 14 , 1801 ) was a general during the American Revolutionary War who originally fought for the American Continental Army but defected to the British Army . While a general on the American side , he obtained command of the fortifications at West Point , New York ( future site of the U.S. Military Academy after 1802 ) , overlooking the cliffs at the Hudson River ( upriver from British @-@ occupied New York City ) , and planned to surrender it to the British forces . The plan was exposed in September 1780 , and he was commissioned into the British Army as a brigadier general . 
 Arnold was born in Connecticut and was a merchant operating ships on the Atlantic Ocean when the war broke out in 1775 . He joined the growing army outside Boston and distinguished himself through acts of intelligence and bravery . His actions included the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775 , defensive and delaying tactics at the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in 1776 ( allowing American forces time to prepare New York 's defenses ) , the Battle of Ridgefield , Connecticut ( after which he was promoted to major general ) , operations in relief of the Siege of Fort Stanwix , and key actions during the pivotal Battles of Saratoga in 1777 , in which he suffered leg injuries that ended his combat career for several years . 
 Despite Arnold 's successes , he was passed over for promotion by the Continental Congress , while other officers claimed credit for some of his accomplishments . Adversaries in military and political circles brought charges of corruption or other malfeasance , but most often he was acquitted in formal inquiries . Congress investigated his accounts and found that he was indebted to Congress after having spent much of his own money on the war effort . Arnold was frustrated and bitter at this , as well as with the alliance with France and the failure of Congress to accept Britain 's 1778 proposal to grant full self @-@ governance in the colonies . He decided to change sides and opened secret negotiations with the British . In July 1780 , he was awarded command of West Point . Arnold 's scheme was to surrender the fort to the British , but it was exposed when American forces captured British Major John André carrying papers which revealed the plot . Upon learning of André 's capture , Arnold fled down the Hudson River to the British sloop @-@ of @-@ war Vulture , narrowly avoiding capture by the forces of George Washington , who had been alerted to the plot . 
 Arnold received a commission as a brigadier general in the British Army , an annual pension of £ 360 , and a lump sum of over £ 6 @,@ 000 . He led British forces on raids in Virginia and against New London and Groton , Connecticut before the war effectively ended with the American victory at Yorktown . In the winter of 1782 , Arnold moved to London with his second wife Margaret " Peggy " Shippen Arnold . He was well received by King George III and the Tories , but frowned upon by the Whigs . In 1787 , he returned to the merchant business with his sons Richard and Henry in Saint John , New Brunswick . He returned to London to settle permanently in 1791 , where he died ten years later . 
 His name quickly became a byword in the United States for treason or betrayal because he betrayed his countrymen by leading the British army in battle against the men whom he once commanded . His earlier legacy is recalled in the ambiguous nature of some of the memorials that have been placed in his honor . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Benedict was born the second of six children to Benedict Arnold ( 1683 – 1761 ) and Hannah Waterman King in Norwich , Connecticut on January 14 , 1741 . He was named after his great @-@ grandfather Benedict Arnold , an early governor of the Colony of Rhode Island — as were his father and grandfather , as well as an older brother who died in infancy . Only Benedict and his sister Hannah survived to adulthood ; his other siblings succumbed to yellow fever in childhood . His siblings were , in order of birth : Benedict ( August 15 , 1738 – April 30 , 1739 ) , Hannah ( December 9 , 1742 – August 11 , 1803 ) , Mary ( June 4 , 1745 – September 10 , 1753 ) , Absolom ( April 4 , 1747 – July 22 , 1750 ) , and Elizabeth ( November 19 , 1749 – September 29 , 1755 ) . Arnold was a descendant of John <unk> through his maternal grandmother , an ancestor of at least six U.S. presidents . 
 Arnold 's father was a successful businessman , and the family moved in the upper levels of Norwich society . When he was ten , Arnold was enrolled in a private school in nearby Canterbury , with the expectation that he would eventually attend Yale . However , the deaths of his siblings two years later may have contributed to a decline in the family fortunes , since his father took up drinking . By the time that he was fourteen , there was no money for private education . His father 's alcoholism and ill health kept him from training Arnold in the family mercantile business , but his mother 's family connections secured an apprenticeship for him with two of her cousins , brothers Daniel and Joshua Lathrop , who operated a successful apothecary and general merchandise trade in Norwich . His apprenticeship with the Lathrops lasted seven years . 
 In 1755 , Arnold was attracted by the sound of a drummer and attempted to enlist in the provincial militia for service against the French , but his mother refused permission . In 1757 when he was sixteen , he did enlist in the Connecticut militia , which marched off toward Albany and Lake George . The French had besieged Fort William Henry in northeastern New York , and their Indian allies had committed atrocities after their victory . Word of the siege 's disastrous outcome led the company to turn around ; Arnold served for 13 days . A commonly accepted story that Arnold deserted from militia service in 1758 is based on uncertain documentary evidence . 
 Arnold was very close to his mother , who died in 1759 . His father 's alcoholism worsened after the death of his wife , and the youth took on the responsibility of supporting his father and younger sister . His father was arrested on several occasions for public drunkenness , was refused communion by his church , and eventually died in 1761 . 
 = = Businessman = = 
 Arnold established himself in business in 1762 as a pharmacist and bookseller in New Haven , Connecticut with the help of the Lathrops . He was hardworking and successful , and was able to rapidly expand his business . In 1763 , he repaid money borrowed from the Lathrops , repurchased the family homestead that his father had sold when deeply in debt , and re @-@ sold it a year later for a substantial profit . In 1764 , he formed a partnership with Adam Babcock , another young New Haven merchant . They bought three trading ships , using the profits from the sale of his homestead , and established a lucrative West Indies trade . 
 During this time , he brought his sister Hannah to New Haven and established her in his apothecary to manage the business in his absence . He traveled extensively in the course of his business throughout New England and from Quebec to the West Indies , often in command of one of his own ships . On one of his voyages , Arnold fought a duel in Honduras with a British sea captain who had called him a " damned Yankee , destitute of good manners or those of a gentleman " . The captain was wounded after the first exchange of gunfire , and apologized after Arnold threatened to aim to kill on the second . 
 The Sugar Act of 1764 and the Stamp Act of 1765 severely curtailed mercantile trade in the colonies . The latter act prompted Arnold to join the chorus of voices in opposition to those taxes , and also led to his entry into the Sons of Liberty , a secret organization that was not afraid to use violence to oppose implementation of those and other unpopular Parliamentary measures . Arnold initially took no part in any public demonstrations but , like many merchants , continued to trade as if the Stamp Act did not exist , in effect becoming a smuggler in defiance of the act . Arnold also faced financial ruin , falling £ 16 @,@ 000 in debt , with creditors spreading rumors of his insolvency to the point where he took legal action against them . On the night of January 28 , 1767 , Arnold and members of his crew , watched by a crowd of Sons of Liberty , roughed up a man suspected of attempting to inform authorities of Arnold 's smuggling . Arnold was convicted of a disorderly conduct charge and fined the relatively small amount of 50 shillings ; publicity of the case and widespread sympathy for his view probably contributed to the light sentence . 
 On February 22 , 1767 , Arnold married Margaret Mansfield , daughter of Samuel Mansfield , the sheriff of New Haven , an acquaintance that may have been made through the membership of both Mansfield and Arnold in the local Masonic Lodge . Their son Benedict was born the following year , and was followed by brothers Richard in 1769 and Henry in 1772 . Margaret died early in the revolution on June 19 , 1775 , while Arnold was at Fort Ticonderoga following its capture . The household , even while she lived , was dominated by Arnold 's sister Hannah . Arnold benefited from his relationship with Mansfield , who became a partner in his business and used his position as sheriff to shield Arnold from creditors . 
 Arnold was in the West Indies when the Boston Massacre took place on March 5 , 1770 . He wrote that he was " very much shocked " and wondered " good God , are the Americans all asleep and tamely giving up their liberties , or are they all turned philosophers , that they don 't take immediate vengeance on such miscreants ? " 
 = = Early Revolutionary War = = 
 Arnold began the war as a captain in Connecticut 's militia , a position to which he was elected in March 1775 . His company marched northeast the following month to assist in the siege of Boston that followed the outbreak of hostilities at Lexington and Concord . Arnold proposed to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety an action to seize Fort Ticonderoga in New York , which he knew was poorly defended . They issued him a colonel 's commission on May 3 , 1775 , and he immediately rode off to the west , arriving at Castleton in the disputed New Hampshire Grants ( present @-@ day Vermont ) in time to participate with Ethan Allen and his men in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga . He followed up that action with a bold raid on Fort Saint @-@ Jean on the Richelieu River north of Lake Champlain . A Connecticut militia force arrived at Ticonderoga in June ; Arnold had a dispute with its commander over control of the fort , and resigned his Massachusetts commission . He was on his way home from Ticonderoga when he learned that his wife had died earlier in June . 
 The Second Continental Congress authorized an invasion of Quebec , in part on the urging of Arnold — but he was passed over for command of the expedition . Arnold then went to Cambridge , Massachusetts and suggested to George Washington a second expedition to attack Quebec City via a wilderness route through present @-@ day Maine . Arnold received a colonel 's commission in the Continental Army for this expedition . He left Cambridge in September 1775 with 1 @,@ 100 men . Arnold arrived before Quebec City in November , after a difficult passage in which 300 men turned back and another 200 died en route . He and his men were joined by Richard Montgomery 's small army and participated in the December 31 assault on Quebec City in which Montgomery was killed and Arnold 's leg was shattered . His chaplain Rev. Samuel Spring carried him to the makeshift hospital at the Hôtel Dieu . Arnold was promoted to brigadier general for his role in reaching Quebec , and he maintained an ineffectual siege of the city until he was replaced by Major General David Wooster in April 1776 . 
 Arnold then traveled to Montreal where he served as military commander of the city until forced to retreat by an advancing British army that had arrived at Quebec in May . He presided over the rear of the Continental Army during its retreat from Saint @-@ Jean , where he was reported by James Wilkinson to be the last person to leave before the British arrived . He then directed the construction of a fleet to defend Lake Champlain , which was overmatched and defeated in the October 1776 Battle of Valcour Island . However , his actions at Saint @-@ Jean and Valcour Island played a notable role in delaying the British advance against Ticonderoga until 1777 . 
 During these actions , Arnold made a number of friends and a larger number of enemies within the army power structure and in Congress . He had established decent relationships with George Washington , commander of the army , as well as Philip Schuyler and Horatio Gates , both of whom had command of the army 's Northern Department during 1775 and 1776 . However , an acrimonious dispute with Moses Hazen , commander of the 2nd Canadian Regiment , boiled over into a court martial of Hazen at Ticonderoga during the summer of 1776 . Only action by Gates , then Arnold 's superior at Ticonderoga , prevented his own arrest on countercharges leveled by Hazen . He also had disagreements with John Brown and James Easton , two lower @-@ level officers with political connections that resulted in ongoing suggestions of improprieties on his part . Brown was particularly vicious , publishing a handbill which claimed of Arnold , " Money is this man 's God , and to get enough of it he would sacrifice his country " .

 General Washington assigned Arnold to the defense of Rhode Island following the British seizure of Newport in December 1776 , where the militia were too poorly equipped to even consider an attack on the British . Arnold took the opportunity to visit his children while near his home in New Haven , and he spent much of the winter socializing in Boston , where he unsuccessfully courted a young belle named Betsy <unk> . In February 1777 , he learned that he had been passed over by Congress for promotion to major general . Washington refused his offer to resign , and wrote to members of Congress in an attempt to correct this , noting that " two or three other very good officers " might be lost if they persisted in making politically motivated promotions . 
 Arnold was on his way to Philadelphia to discuss his future when he was alerted that a British force was marching toward a supply depot in Danbury , Connecticut . He organized the militia response , along with David Wooster and Connecticut militia General Gold S. Silliman . He led a small contingent of militia attempting to stop or slow the British return to the coast in the Battle of Ridgefield , and was again wounded in his left leg . 
 Arnold continued on to Philadelphia , where he met with members of Congress about his rank . His action at Ridgefield , coupled with the death of Wooster due to wounds sustained in the action , resulted in Arnold 's promotion to major general , although his seniority was not restored over those who had been promoted before him . Amid negotiations over that issue , Arnold wrote out a letter of resignation on July 11 , the same day that word arrived in Philadelphia that Fort Ticonderoga had fallen to the British . Washington refused his resignation and ordered him north to assist with the defense there . 
 Arnold arrived in Schuyler 's camp at Fort Edward , New York on July 24 . On August 13 , Schuyler dispatched him with a force of 900 to relieve the siege of Fort Stanwix , where he succeeded in the use of a ruse to lift the siege . Arnold had an Indian messenger sent into the camp of British Brigadier General Barry St. Leger with news that the approaching force was much larger and closer than it actually was ; this convinced St. Leger 's Indian support to abandon him , forcing him to give up the effort . 
 Arnold then returned to the Hudson , where General Gates had taken over command of the American army , which had by then retreated to a camp south of Stillwater . He then distinguished himself in both Battles of Saratoga , even though General Gates removed him from field command after the first battle , following a series of escalating disagreements and disputes that culminated in a shouting match . During the fighting in the second battle , Arnold operated against Gates ' orders and took to the battlefield to lead attacks on the British defenses . He was again severely wounded in the left leg late in the fighting . Arnold himself said that it would have been better had it been in the chest instead of the leg . Burgoyne surrendered ten days after the second battle , on October 17 , 1777 . In response to Arnold 's valor at Saratoga , Congress restored his command seniority . However , Arnold interpreted the manner in which they did so as an act of sympathy for his wounds , and not an apology or recognition that they were righting a wrong . 
 Arnold spent several months recovering from his injuries . Rather than allowing his shattered left leg to be amputated , he had it crudely set , leaving it 2 inches ( 5 cm ) shorter than the right . He returned to the army at Valley Forge in May 1778 to the applause of men who had served under him at Saratoga . There he participated in the first recorded Oath of Allegiance along with many other soldiers , as a sign of loyalty to the United States . 
 The British withdrew from Philadelphia in June 1778 , and Washington appointed Arnold military commander of the city . Even before the Americans reoccupied Philadelphia , Arnold began planning to capitalize financially on the change in power there , engaging in a variety of business deals designed to profit from war @-@ related supply movements and benefiting from the protection of his authority . Such schemes were not exactly uncommon among American officers , but Arnold 's schemes were sometimes frustrated by powerful local politicians who eventually amassed enough evidence to publicly air charges against him . Arnold demanded a court martial to clear the charges , writing to Washington in May 1779 , " Having become a cripple in the service of my country , I little expected to meet [ such ] ungrateful returns " . 
 Arnold lived extravagantly in Philadelphia , and was a prominent figure on the social scene . During the summer of 1778 , he met Peggy Shippen , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old daughter of Judge Edward Shippen , a Loyalist sympathizer who had done business with the British while they occupied the city . Peggy had been courted by British Major John André during the British occupation of Philadelphia . Peggy and Arnold married on April 8 , 1779 . Peggy and her circle of friends had found methods of staying in contact with paramours across the battle lines , despite military bans on communication with the enemy . Some of this communication was effected through the services of Joseph Stansbury , a Philadelphia merchant . 
 = = Plotting to change sides = = 
 As early as 1778 , there were signs that Arnold was unhappy with his situation and pessimistic about the country 's future . On November 10 , 1778 , General Nathanael Greene wrote to General John Cadwalader , " I am told General Arnold is become very unpopular among you <unk> to his <unk> too much with the Tories . " A few days later , Greene received a letter from Arnold , where Arnold lamented over the " deplorable " and " horrid " situation of the country at that particular moment , citing the depreciating currency , disaffection of the army , and internal fighting in Congress for the country 's problems , while predicting " impending ruin " if things would not soon change . 
 Some time early in May 1779 , Arnold met with Joseph Stansbury ( whose testimony before a British commission apparently erroneously placed his meeting with Arnold in June ) . Stansbury said that he then " went secretly to New York with a tender of [ Arnold 's ] services to Sir Henry Clinton . " Stansbury ignored instructions from Arnold to involve no one else in the plot , and crossed the British lines and went to see Jonathan Odell in New York . Odell was a Loyalist working with William Franklin , the last colonial governor of New Jersey and the son of Benjamin Franklin . On May 9 , Franklin introduced Stansbury to Major André , who had just been named the British spy chief . This was the beginning of a secret correspondence between Arnold and André , sometimes using his wife Peggy as a willing intermediary , that culminated over a year later with Arnold 's change of sides . 
 = = = Secret communications = = = 
 André conferred with General Clinton , who gave him broad authority to pursue Arnold 's offer . André then drafted instructions to Stansbury and Arnold . This initial letter opened a discussion on the types of assistance and intelligence that Arnold might provide , and included instructions for how to communicate in the future . Letters would be passed through the women 's circle that Peggy Arnold was a part of , but only Peggy would be aware that some letters contained instructions , written in both code and invisible ink , that were to be passed on to André , using Stansbury as the courier . 
 By July 1779 , Arnold was providing the British with troop locations and strengths , as well as the locations of supply depots , all the while negotiating over compensation . At first , he asked for indemnification of his losses and £ 10 @,@ 000 , an amount that the Continental Congress had given Charles Lee for his services in the Continental Army . General Clinton was pursuing a campaign to gain control of the Hudson River Valley , and was interested in plans and information on the defenses of West Point and other defenses on the Hudson River . He also began to insist on a face @-@ to @-@ face meeting , and suggested to Arnold that he pursue another high @-@ level command . By October 1779 , the negotiations had ground to a halt . Furthermore , Patriot mobs were scouring Philadelphia for Loyalists , and Arnold and the Shippen family were being threatened . Arnold was rebuffed by Congress and by local authorities in requests for security details for himself and his in @-@ laws . 
 = = = Court martial = = = 
 The court martial to consider the charges against Arnold began meeting on June 1 , 1779 , but was delayed until December 1779 by General Clinton 's capture of Stony Point , New York , throwing the army into a flurry of activity to react . A number of members of the panel of judges were ill @-@ disposed to Arnold over actions and disputes earlier in the war , yet Arnold was cleared of all but two minor charges on January 26 , 1780 . Arnold worked over the next few months to publicize this fact ; however , Washington published a formal rebuke of Arnold 's behavior in early April , just one week after he had congratulated Arnold on the March 19 birth of his son Edward Shippen Arnold . 
 The Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief would have been much happier in an occasion of bestowing commendations on an officer who had rendered such distinguished services to his country as Major General Arnold ; but in the present case , a sense of duty and a regard to candor oblige him to declare that he considers his conduct [ in the convicted actions ] as imprudent and improper . 
 Shortly after Washington 's rebuke , a Congressional inquiry into his expenditures concluded that Arnold had failed to fully account for his expenditures incurred during the Quebec invasion , and that he owed the Congress some £ 1 @,@ 000 , largely because he was unable to document them . A significant number of these documents had been lost during the retreat from Quebec . Angry and frustrated , Arnold resigned his military command of Philadelphia in late April . 
 = = = Offer to surrender West Point = = = 
 Early in April , Philip Schuyler had approached Arnold with the possibility of giving him the command at West Point . Discussions between Schuyler and Washington on the subject had not borne fruit by early June . Arnold reopened the secret channels with the British , informing them of Schuyler 's proposals and including Schuyler 's assessment of conditions at West Point . He also provided information on a proposed French @-@ American invasion of Quebec that was to go up the Connecticut River . ( Arnold did not know that this proposed invasion was a ruse intended to divert British resources . ) On June 16 , Arnold inspected West Point while on his way home to Connecticut to take care of personal business , and sent a highly detailed report through the secret channel . When he reached Connecticut , Arnold arranged to sell his home there , and began transferring assets to London through intermediaries in New York . By early July he was back in Philadelphia , where he wrote another secret message to Clinton on July 7 , which implied that his appointment to West Point was assured and that he might even provide a " drawing of the works ... by which you might take [ West Point ] without loss " . 
 Major André returned victorious from the Siege of Charleston on June 18 , and both he and General Clinton were immediately caught up in this news . Clinton was concerned that Washington 's army and the French fleet would join in Rhode Island , and he again fixed on West Point as a strategic point to capture . André had spies and informers keeping track of Arnold to verify his movements . Excited by the prospects , Clinton informed his superiors of his intelligence coup , but failed to respond to Arnold 's July 7 letter . 
 Arnold next wrote a series of letters to Clinton , even before he might have expected a response to the July 7 letter . In a July 11 letter , he complained that the British did not appear to trust him , and threatened to break off negotiations unless progress was made . On July 12 , he wrote again , making explicit the offer to surrender West Point , although his price rose to £ 20 @,@ 000 ( in addition to indemnification for his losses ) , with a £ 1 @,@ 000 down payment to be delivered with the response . These letters were delivered by Samuel Wallis , another Philadelphia businessman who spied for the British , rather than by Stansbury . 
 = = = Command at West Point = = = 
 On August 3 , 1780 , Arnold obtained command of West Point . On August 15 , he received a coded letter from André with Clinton 's final offer : £ 20 @,@ 000 , and no indemnification for his losses . Due to difficulties in getting the messages across the lines , neither side knew for some days that the other was in agreement to that offer . Arnold 's letters continued to detail Washington 's troop movements and provide information about French reinforcements that were being organized . On August 25 , Peggy finally delivered to him Clinton 's agreement to the terms . 
 Washington , in assigning Arnold to the command at West Point , also gave him authority over the entire American @-@ controlled Hudson River , from Albany down to the British lines outside New York City . While en route to West Point , Arnold renewed an acquaintance with Joshua Hett Smith , someone whom Arnold knew had spied for both sides and who owned a house near the western bank of the Hudson about 15 miles south of West Point . 
 Once he established himself at West Point , Arnold began systematically weakening its defenses and military strength . Needed repairs on the chain across the Hudson were never ordered . Troops were liberally distributed within Arnold 's command area ( but only minimally at West Point itself ) , or furnished to Washington on request . He also peppered Washington with complaints about the lack of supplies , writing , " Everything is wanting . " At the same time , he tried to drain West Point 's supplies , so that a siege would be more likely to succeed . His subordinates , some long @-@ time associates , grumbled about Arnold 's unnecessary distribution of supplies and eventually concluded that Arnold was selling supplies on the black market for personal gain . 
 On August 30 , Arnold sent a letter accepting Clinton 's terms and proposing a meeting to André through yet another intermediary : William Heron , a member of the Connecticut Assembly whom he thought he could trust . Heron , in a comic twist , went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter , and offered his own services to the British as a spy . He then took the letter back to Connecticut , suspicious of Arnold 's actions , where he delivered it to the head of the Connecticut militia . General Parsons laid it aside , seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion . Four days later , Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services of the wife of a prisoner @-@ of @-@ war . Eventually , a meeting was set for September 11 near Dobb 's Ferry . This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river fired on his boat , not having been informed of his impending arrival . 
 = = = Plot exposed = = = 
 Arnold and André finally met on September 21 at the Joshua Hett Smith House . On the morning of September 22 , James Livingston , the colonel in charge of the outpost at Verplanck 's Point , fired on HMS Vulture , the ship that was intended to carry André back to New York . This action did sufficient damage that she retreated downriver , forcing André to return to New York overland . Arnold wrote out passes for André so that he would be able to pass through the lines , and also gave him plans for West Point . 
 André was captured near Tarrytown on Saturday , September 23 by three Westchester militiamen named John Paulding , Isaac Van Wart , and David Williams . The papers exposing the plot to capture West Point were found and sent to Washington , where Arnold 's intentions came to light after Washington examined them . Meanwhile , André convinced the unsuspecting commanding officer to whom he was delivered , Colonel John Jameson , to send him back to Arnold at West Point . However , Major Benjamin Tallmadge , a member of Washington 's secret service , insisted that Jameson order the prisoner to be intercepted and brought back . Jameson reluctantly recalled the lieutenant who had been delivering André into Arnold 's custody , but then sent the same lieutenant as a messenger to notify Arnold of André 's arrest . 
 Arnold learned of André 's capture the following morning , September 24 , when he received Jameson 's message that André was in his custody and that the papers that André was carrying had been sent to General Washington . Arnold received Jameson 's letter while waiting for Washington , with whom he had planned to have breakfast . 
 He hastened to the shore and ordered <unk> to row him downriver to where HMS Vulture was anchored , which then took him to New York . From the ship , Arnold wrote a letter to Washington , requesting that Peggy be given safe passage to her family in Philadelphia , a request that Washington granted . 
 When presented with evidence of Arnold 's activities , it is reported that Washington remained calm . He did , however , investigate its extent , and suggested in negotiations with General Clinton over the fate of Major André that he was willing to exchange André for Arnold . This suggestion Clinton refused ; after a military tribunal , André was hanged at Tappan , New York on October 2 . Washington also infiltrated men into New York in an attempt to capture Arnold . This plan very nearly succeeded , but failed when Arnold changed living quarters prior to sailing for Virginia in December . 
 Arnold justified his actions in an open letter titled To the Inhabitants of America , published in newspapers in October 1780 . In the letter to Washington requesting safe passage for Peggy , he wrote , " Love to my country <unk> my present conduct , however it may appear inconsistent to the world , who very seldom judge right of any man 's actions . "

 = = = British Army service = = = 
 The British gave Arnold a brigadier general 's commission with an annual income of several hundred pounds , but paid him only £ 6 @,@ 315 plus an annual pension of £ 360 because his plot had failed . In December 1780 , Arnold led a force of 1 @,@ 600 troops into Virginia under orders from Clinton , where he captured Richmond by surprise and then went on a rampage through Virginia , destroying supply houses , foundries , and mills . This activity brought out Virginia 's militia , led by Colonel Sampson Mathews , and Arnold eventually retreated to Portsmouth to either be evacuated or reinforced . 
 The pursuing American army included the Marquis de Lafayette , who was under orders from Washington to hang Arnold summarily if he was captured . Reinforcements arrived in late March led by William Phillips ( who served under Burgoyne at Saratoga ) , and Phillips led further raids across Virginia , including a defeat of Baron von Steuben at Petersburg , until his death of fever on May 12 , 1781 . Arnold commanded the army only until May 20 , when Lord Cornwallis arrived with the southern army and took over . One colonel wrote to Clinton of Arnold , " there are many officers who must wish some other general in command . " Cornwallis ignored advice proffered by Arnold to locate a permanent base away from the coast , advice that might have averted Cornwallis 's later surrender at Yorktown . 
 On his return to New York in June , Arnold made a variety of proposals for attacks on economic targets to force the Americans to end the war . Clinton was uninterested in most of Arnold 's aggressive ideas , but finally authorized Arnold to raid the port of New London , Connecticut . On September 4 , not long after the birth of his and Peggy 's second son , Arnold 's force of over 1 @,@ 700 men raided and burned New London and captured Fort Griswold , causing damage estimated at $ 500 @,@ 000 . British casualties were high ; nearly one quarter of the force was killed or wounded . Clinton declared that he could ill afford any more such victories . 
 Even before Cornwallis ' surrender in October , Arnold had requested permission from Clinton to go to England to give Lord George Germain his thoughts on the war in person . When word of the surrender reached New York , Arnold renewed the request , which Clinton then granted . On December 8 , 1781 , Arnold and his family left New York for England . 
 In London , he aligned himself with the Tories , advising Germain and King George III to renew the fight against the Americans . In the House of Commons , Edmund Burke expressed the hope that the government would not put Arnold " at the head of a part of a British army " lest " the sentiments of true honor , which every British officer [ holds ] dearer than life , should be afflicted . " To Arnold 's detriment , the anti @-@ war Whigs had gotten the upper hand in Parliament , and Germain was forced to resign , with the government of Lord North falling not long after . 
 Arnold then applied to accompany General Carleton , who was going to New York to replace Clinton as commander @-@ in @-@ chief ; this request went nowhere . Other attempts all failed to gain positions within the government or the British East India Company over the next few years , and he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non @-@ wartime service . His reputation also came under criticism in the British press , especially when compared to that of Major André , who was celebrated for his patriotism . 
 One particularly harsh critic said that he was a " mean mercenary , who , having adopted a cause for the sake of plunder , quits it when convicted of that charge . " In turning him down for an East India Company posting , George Johnstone wrote , " Although I am satisfied with the purity of your conduct , the generality do not think so . While this is the case , no power in this country could suddenly place you in the situation you aim at under the East India Company . " 
 = = = New business opportunities = = = 
 In 1785 , Arnold and his son Richard moved to Saint John , New Brunswick , where they speculated in land and established a business doing trade with the West Indies . Arnold purchased large tracts of land in the Maugerville area , and acquired city lots in Saint John and Fredericton . Delivery of his first ship the Lord Sheffield was accompanied by accusations from the builder that Arnold had cheated him ; Arnold claimed that he had merely deducted the contractually agreed amount when the ship was delivered late . After her first voyage , Arnold returned to London in 1786 to bring his family to Saint John . While there , he disentangled himself from a lawsuit over an unpaid debt that Peggy had been fighting while he was away , paying £ 900 to settle a £ 12 @,@ 000 loan that he had taken while living in Philadelphia . The family moved to Saint John in 1787 , where Arnold created an uproar with a series of bad business deals and petty lawsuits . The most serious of these was a slander suit which he won against a former business partner ; and following this , townspeople burned him in effigy in front of his house , as Peggy and the children watched . The family left Saint John to return to London in December 1791 . 
 In July 1792 , Arnold fought a bloodless duel with the Earl of Lauderdale after the Earl impugned his honor in the House of Lords . With the outbreak of the French Revolution , Arnold outfitted a privateer , while continuing to do business in the West Indies , even though the hostilities increased the risk . He was imprisoned by French authorities on Guadeloupe amid accusations of spying for the British , and narrowly eluded hanging by escaping to the blockading British fleet after bribing his guards . He helped organize militia forces on British @-@ held islands , receiving praise from the landowners for his efforts on their behalf . He hoped that this work would earn him wider respect and a new command ; instead , it earned him and his sons a land @-@ grant of 15 @,@ 000 acres ( 6 @,@ 100 ha ) in Upper Canada , near present @-@ day Renfrew , Ontario . 
 = = Death = = 
 In January 1801 , Arnold 's health began to decline . He had suffered from gout since 1775 , and the condition attacked his unwounded leg to the point where he was unable to go to sea . The other leg ached constantly , and he walked only with a cane . His physicians diagnosed him as having dropsy , and a visit to the countryside only temporarily improved his condition . He died after four days of delirium on June 14 , 1801 , at the age of 60 . Legend has it that , when he was on his deathbed , he said , " Let me die in this old uniform in which I fought my battles . May God forgive me for ever having put on another , " but this story may be apocryphal . Arnold was buried at St. Mary 's Church , Battersea in London , England . As a result of a clerical error in the parish records , his remains were removed to an unmarked mass grave during church renovations a century later . His funeral procession boasted " seven mourning coaches and four state carriages " ; the funeral was without military honors . 
 He left a small estate , reduced in size by his debts , which Peggy undertook to clear . Among his bequests were considerable gifts to one John Sage , perhaps an illegitimate son or grandson .

 Arnold 's contributions to American independence are largely underrepresented in popular culture , while his name became synonymous with traitor in the 19th century . The demonization of Arnold began immediately after his betrayal became public . Biblical themes were often invoked ; Benjamin Franklin wrote that " Judas sold only one man , Arnold three millions " , and Alexander Scammell described Arnold 's actions as " black as hell " . 
 Early biographers attempted to describe Arnold 's entire life in terms of treacherous or morally questionable behavior . The first major biography of Arnold was The Life and Treason of Benedict Arnold , published in 1832 by historian Jared Sparks ; it was particularly harsh in showing how Arnold 's treacherous character was allegedly formed out of childhood experiences . George Canning Hill authored a series of moralistic biographies in the mid @-@ 19th century , and began his 1865 biography of Arnold : " Benedict , the Traitor , was born ... " . 
 Social historian Brian <unk> notes that , as the 19th century progressed , the story of Arnold 's betrayal was portrayed with near @-@ mythical proportions as a part of the national creation story . It was invoked again as sectional conflicts increased in the years before the American Civil War . Washington Irving used it as part of an argument against dismemberment of the union in his 1857 Life of George Washington , pointing out that the unity of New England and the southern states which led to independence was made possible in part by holding West Point . Jefferson Davis and other southern secessionist leaders were unfavorably compared to Arnold , implicitly and explicitly likening the idea of secession to treason . Harper 's Weekly published an article in 1861 describing Confederate leaders as " a few men directing this colossal treason , by whose side Benedict Arnold shines white as a saint . " 
 Fictional invocations of Arnold 's name also carried strongly negative overtones . A moralistic children 's tale entitled " The Cruel Boy " was widely circulated in the 19th century . It described a boy who stole eggs from birds ' nests , pulled wings off insects , and engaged in other sorts of wanton cruelty , who then grew up to become a traitor to his country . The boy is not identified until the end of the story , when his place of birth is given as Norwich , Connecticut , and his name is given as Benedict Arnold . However , not all depictions of Arnold were so negative . Some theatrical treatments of the 19th century explored his duplicity , seeking to understand rather than demonize it . 
 The connection between Arnold and treason continued into the 20th and 21st centuries . On an episode of The Brady Bunch , " Everyone Can 't Be George Washington " , Peter is assigned the role of Arnold in the school play , and is ostracized . On one of The Simpsons ' Halloween specials , Treehouse of Horror IV , Arnold is included in a " jury of the damned " – along with other figures like John Wilkes Booth and Richard Nixon – deliberating the ownership of Homer Simpson 's soul . 
 Dan Gilbert , owner of the National Basketball Association 's Cleveland Cavaliers , subtly invoked Arnold in 2010 , upset over LeBron James 's announcement of leaving the team . Gilbert 's company lowered the price of posters bearing James 's likeness to $ 17 @.@ 41 , referring to the year of Arnold 's birth . 
 Novels related to the American Revolutionary war sometimes feature Arnold as a character . Kenneth Roberts ' Arundel series treats him more positively , covering his military campaigns . 
 = = = Canada = = = 
 Canadian historians have treated Arnold as a relatively minor figure . His difficult time in New Brunswick led historians to summarize it as full of " controversy , resentment , and legal entanglements " and to conclude that he was disliked by both Americans and Loyalists . Historian Barry Wilson points out that Arnold 's descendants ended up establishing deep roots in the country , becoming leading settlers in Upper Canada and later in lands further west , where they established settlements in Saskatchewan . His descendants who adopted the Arnold surname are spread across Canada , most of all those of John Sage . His long woollen British scarlet military jacket with a buff lining continues to be owned by descendants ; as of 2001 , it was held in Saskatchewan . It has reportedly been passed in each generation to the eldest male of the family .

 During his marriage to Margaret Mansfield , Arnold had three sons , all of whom later served in the British Army : 
 Benedict Arnold ( 1768 – 1795 ) ( Captain ) 
 Richard Arnold ( 1769 – 1847 ) ( Lieutenant ) 
 Henry Arnold ( 1772 – 1826 ) 
 and with Peggy Shippen , he raised a family also active in the British Army :

 There is a memorial to Arnold on the Saratoga battlefield , now preserved within Saratoga National Historical Park , that does not mention his name . Donated by Civil War General John Watts DePeyster , the inscription on the Boot Monument reads : " In memory of the most brilliant soldier of the Continental army , who was desperately wounded on this spot , winning for his countrymen the decisive battle of the American Revolution , and for himself the rank of Major General . " The victory monument at Saratoga has four niches , three of which are occupied by statues of Generals Gates , Schuyler , and Morgan . The fourth niche is empty . 
 On the grounds of the United States Military Academy at West Point there are plaques commemorating all of the generals that served in the Revolution . One plaque bears only a rank and a date ( " major general ... born 1740 " ) but no name . 
 A historical marker in Danvers , Massachusetts commemorates Arnold 's 1775 expedition to Quebec . There are also historical markers bearing Arnold 's name in Moscow , Maine , on the western bank of Lake Champlain , New York , and two in Skowhegan , Maine . 
 The house where Arnold lived at 62 Gloucester Place in central London bears a plaque describing Arnold as an " American Patriot . " The church where Arnold was buried , St Mary 's Church , Battersea , England , has a commemorative stained @-@ glass window , added between 1976 and 1982 . The faculty club at the University of New Brunswick , Fredericton , has a Benedict Arnold Room , in which framed original letters written by Arnold hang on the walls .

 Firehawk may not have been the first Flying Dutchman model from Vekoma , a title that belongs to Nighthawk at Carowinds , but it was billed as the Midwest 's first and only flying roller coaster when it opened in 2001 . The notability was short @-@ lived , as the opening of Superman : Ultimate Flight at Six Flags Great America two years later meant it was no longer alone in the region . In addition , Firehawk 's layout is identical to Batwing , another Vekoma Flying Dutchman , located at Six Flags America in Upper Marlboro , Maryland .

 While the park was still named Six Flags Ohio , plans for a new roller coaster known as X @-@ Flight were revealed on January 4 , 2001 . Six days later , Six Flags purchased SeaWorld Ohio – next to Geauga Lake – with the intent of merging the two to create Six Flags Worlds of Adventure . The new venture advertised X @-@ Flight as the first Flying roller coaster in the Midwest , and it was the park 's tenth roller coaster overall – the fifth added since 2000 . The new coaster was built on a former bus parking lot , and Geauga Lake Road had to be rerouted around the ride . Regarding the design of the attraction , Jake Bateman , Vice President and General Manager of Six Flags Worlds of Adventure , said : 
 Land clearing began on December 1 , 2000 , and construction on the footers began February 9 , 2001 . X @-@ Flight was originally supposed to open in early May 2001 , but due to technical difficulties , its opening was delayed . During testing , problems were discovered with several devices including the reclining mechanism on the trains and their restraints . X @-@ Flight 's media day was eventually held on May 24 , 2001 , and the ride officially opened two days later on May 26 . 
 Cedar Fair purchased the park from Six Flags in 2004 for $ 145 million . They announced intentions of returning the park to its roots as a family @-@ oriented amusement park . The efforts to downsize the park eventually led to X @-@ Flight 's removal . On November 22 , 2006 , Geauga Lake park officials announced that X @-@ Flight was being dismantled to be sent to another unspecified Cedar Fair property . Moving the ride would take some time , as the final sections of track and supports wouldn 't be removed until March 2007 .

 On January 22 , 2007 , green Vekoma track resembling the track of X @-@ Flight was spotted at Kings Island , a Cedar Fair park in Mason , Ohio . On February 5 , 2007 , Kings Island officially announced Firehawk as the former X @-@ Flight roller coaster from Geauga Lake . Construction was scheduled to begin later that month , and the opening was set for Memorial Day weekend later that year . X @-@ Flight 's neon green track and dark blue supports were re @-@ painted red and steel gray , respectively . It was built in an area next to Flight of Fear , creating a new area named X @-@ Base which connects to nearby area Coney Mall . Firehawk officially opened as scheduled on May 26 , 2007 . It was the first roller coaster to be introduced at the park since Cedar Fair purchased it from Paramount Parks in 2006 . The first 2 @,@ 500 riders received commemorative Firehawk T @-@ shirts .

 The steel track is 3 @,@ 340 feet ( 1 @,@ 020 m ) in length , and the height of the lift is 115 feet ( 35 m ) . There are approximately 300 sections of track colored red with steel gray supports . When the ride operated at Geauga Lake , the track was neon green with dark blue supports . 
 Firehawk has a total of five inversions - one vertical loop , two inline twists , and four 180 @-@ degree inline twists that are each counted as a half inversion . These 180 @-@ degree inline twists are also known as " Lie to Fly " and " Fly to Lie " elements , in which riders on their backs are flipped to face the ground or vice versa . 
 = = = Layout = = = 
 Once riders are seated and restrained , the train is tilted backwards into a ' lay @-@ down ' position and dispatched . The train travels backwards out of the station , turns left and travels up the 115 @-@ foot ( 35 m ) lift hill at a 33 degree angle . Once the train reaches the top of the lift hill , it dips down into a twist ( called a " Lie @-@ to @-@ Fly " ) that turns the trains upside down into a flying position where riders face the ground . After the twist , the train travels down the first drop , reaching speeds of 51 mph ( 82 km / h ) . Riders then proceed through an over banked Horseshoe Curve element , passing the queue area . Following the Horseshoe , the train enters a " Fly @-@ to @-@ Lie " element that turns riders back to a lay @-@ down position . After the banked turn , the ride enters the 66 @-@ foot ( 20 m ) tall vertical loop , where riders experience 4 @.@ 3 G 's . The train then goes into another " Lie @-@ to @-@ Fly " element . Following the loop , riders enter another turn and hit two consecutive inline twists . Following the inline twists , the train enters the final helix followed by the final " Fly @-@ to @-@ Lie " element . Afterwards , the train is slowed to a stop on the brake run before returning to the station . 
 = = = Station = = = 
 The coaster features a dual station which is connected to the main track using a switch track segment ( similar to a railroad switch ) . Dual @-@ station operation allows for two trains to be loaded simultaneously for more efficient operation . This configuration existed since the ride debuted at Geauga Lake . 
 = = = Trains = = = 
 Firehawk currently operates with two trains . There are six cars with four seats in each row for a total of 24 riders per train . There were three trains during the ride 's first year at Geauga Lake , however only two have been used since . The third train became a parts donor for the first two . Originally , riders reclined on the lift hill – rather than in the station – and returned to an upright position prior to re @-@ entering the station . However , this was changed to occur in the station due to problems that arose during the ride 's first season . The trains feature the Firehawk logo on the front colored yellow and red . Previously at Geauga Lake , the X @-@ Flight logo was colored lime green and dark blue .

 On August 8 , 2009 , an adult male passenger was rushed to a hospital after he was found with breathing problems following the ride . He died the same evening . The Hamilton County Coroner 's Office reported that a heart condition was the likely cause of death and ruled it natural . The ride was re @-@ opened at 12 : 10 pm on August 9 , 2009 , after an inspection by the Ohio Department of Agriculture – a division of the state government responsible for amusement park ride safety in Ohio . They determined the ride was operating within the manufacturer 's specifications . 
 = Aliso Creek ( Orange County ) = 
 Aliso Creek ( Spanish for " Alder Creek " ; also called Alisos Creek ) is a 19 @-@ mile ( 31 km ) -long urban stream that runs through Orange County in the U.S. state of California from the Santa Ana Mountains to the Pacific Ocean , collecting seven main tributaries . The creek is mostly channelized , and as of 2004 , the 30 @.@ 4 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 78 @.@ 7 km2 ) watershed had a population of 149 @,@ 000 divided among seven incorporated cities . 
 The creek flows generally south @-@ southwest through a narrow coastal watershed at the southern extreme end of the arid Los Angeles Basin in a fairly straight course . Owing to the submersion of Southern California in the Pacific Ocean as recently as 10 million years ago , the creek flows over marine sedimentary rock that dates from the late Eocene to the Pliocene . The present @-@ day form of the watershed , with its broad sediment @-@ filled valleys and deeply eroded side canyons , was shaped by a climate change during the previous Ice Age that produced Aliso Canyon , the creek 's final gorge . 
 The name was given to the creek by Spanish explorers in the 18th century , although there are now many places in California that use the name . Historically , the creek served as the boundary between the Juaneño ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( Tongva ) Indians . The creek 's watershed then became a major portion of the 1842 Rancho Niguel Mexican Land Grant to Juan Avila , later purchased by two American ranchers . Although attempts to use the creek and its watershed as a municipal water source date to the early 20th century , the water it provided was of poor quality and erratic occurrence . As a result , the creek became neglected throughout the late part of the century , eventually becoming little more than an open wastewater drain . Despite this general decline , the Aliso Creek watershed still supports some biodiversity , and it remains a popular recreational area . 
 Pollution , floods and development of the watershed and the surrounding county have blighted the water quality and wildlife of the creek since the 1960s , when residential suburban development of the eight cities in the watershed began . Pollution continues to be a major problem for the creek — the subject of many water quality and feasibility studies — but , as with many other Orange County streams , little has been done to correct it . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The Native American name for Aliso Creek has almost certainly been lost . The current name of Aliso Creek was given by Spanish conquistadors sometime between the 1750s and the 1800s . The word <unk> means " alder tree " in Spanish , and likely refers to the riparian vegetation that lines the creek especially near its mouth . The California sycamore , Platanus racemosa , is also known as <unk> in Spanish , and is common in the area around the creek . According to the Geographic Names Information System of the United States Geological Survey , there are now 46 places in California that use the name , as well as five other streams in California that use the name , including as a variant name . 
 Other derivatives for Aliso Creek 's name have arisen since then — including " Los Alisos Creek " and " Alisos Creek " . Several nearby geographical features also are named for the creek , including Aliso Peak , a 683 @-@ foot ( 208 m ) headland . A middle school in the Saddleback Valley Unified School District , Los Alisos Intermediate School , borders the creek . The creek is also the namesake of Aliso Creek Road , which crosses the creek once and only parallels it for a short length . The city of Aliso Viejo and several other communities that lie near the stream also share their name with the creek . 
 = = Course = = 
 Aliso Creek rises in the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains , near the community of Portola Hills , part of Lake Forest , and at the boundary of the Cleveland National Forest . The Loma Ridge rises about 1 @,@ 500 feet ( 460 m ) above the creek 's headwaters , which are at an elevation of 2 @,@ 300 feet ( 700 m ) . There is no pond , lake or spring at the creek 's ultimate source ; it starts out as a small seasonal gully that courses southwards through a small valley with relatively little development . The creek then continues generally southwest for 19 miles ( 31 km ) to the Pacific Ocean at Laguna Beach , collecting water from seven major tributaries and over forty minor drains and streams . For much of its course , the creek is channelized and confined by urban development . It only flows freely in several stretches in its far upper and lower course . Passing south of several residential areas on the foothills to the north , Aliso Creek and El Toro Road run parallel for much of the creek 's length upstream from Interstate 5 . Flowing southwest in a small ravine along the right side of the road , the creek soon passes underneath the twin bridges of California State Route 241 , and receives from the right an unnamed northern fork . At this confluence , the creek turns more to the south , then crosses under El Toro Road and bisects another residential area . As it enters the city of Lake Forest , it receives from the right Munger Creek and from the left English Canyon Creek , a larger tributary which drains part of the city of Mission Viejo , 16 miles ( 26 km ) from the mouth . 
 The creek crosses under Trabuco Road and Jeronimo Road ; the latter was once the site of a stream gauge . It makes a bend to the southeast then veers back south , entering a large gulch and crossing beneath Interstate 5 . The creek then enters a culvert beneath Paseo de Valencia , then crosses under Laguna Hills Drive and cascades under Moulton Parkway , through the community of Laguna Hills . It then swings to the southeast and receives the Aliso Hills Channel , which enters from the left , 13 miles ( 21 km ) from the mouth . The Aliso Hills Channel drains much of eastern Laguna Hills , western Mission Viejo , and southeastern Lake Forest . From the confluence , the gradient of the creek flattens sharply and the stream enters a broad and shallow valley that runs between Aliso Creek Road on the west and Alicia Parkway on the east . It passes under California State Route 73 , which crosses the valley on an earthfill and a bridge segment . The creek receives from the right the Dairy Fork , 9 miles ( 14 km ) from the mouth , which drains parts of southern Laguna Hills and northeastern Aliso Viejo . The southwest @-@ flowing Dairy Fork once flowed in a prominent canyon that was filled in the 1960s and 1970s to build the city of Aliso Viejo ; State Route 73 now runs above the former canyon . 
 After receiving the fork , Aliso Creek passes into three massive culverts that cross under Pacific Park Drive , which crosses also on an earthfill . Flowing past several sports complexes , it begins to form the boundary of Aliso Viejo and Laguna Niguel , then crosses under Aliso Creek Road into Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park . Here , it receives from the left its largest tributary , Sulphur Creek . This creek is about 4 @.@ 5 miles ( 7 @.@ 2 km ) long and drains a fair portion of northern Laguna Niguel , 7 miles ( 11 km ) from the mouth . From there , Aliso Creek bends west and enters Aliso Canyon , which cuts through the San Joaquin Hills on the creek 's final run to the sea . About 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) downstream of the Sulphur Creek confluence , the creek is briefly impounded behind a small dam , and receives the south @-@ flowing Wood Canyon Creek , the second largest tributary , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) from the mouth . Wood Canyon Creek drains the largest arm of Aliso Canyon and most of eastern Aliso Viejo . Flowing almost due south through a valley with slopes dissected by many deep side canyons , Aliso Creek turns sharply west as it enters private property less than 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the mouth . This section of the canyon is known for flooding frequently . The creek then enters a reserved size lagoon , crosses under the Pacific Coast Highway and enters the Pacific Ocean . 
 = = = Tidal lagoon = = = 
 At Aliso Beach , the mouth of Aliso Creek , lies a freshwater pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent . Tidal activity at the creek 's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar , impounding it in a small lake about 0 @.@ 2 miles ( 0 @.@ 3 km ) long at its fullest extent . Afterwards , the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach : either waves at high tide wash away the top of the sandbar , or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself . Once the water level rises above the sandbar , rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3 – 5 @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 9 – 1 @.@ 5 m ) -deep lake in a matter of minutes . Peak flows through the sandbar can reach 500 cubic feet per second ( 14 m3 / s ) , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near that size . Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s , the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger , historic extent without breaching . Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way . 
 = = = Discharge = = = 
 Aliso Creek is known to have historically contained water for most of the year , averaging 6 @.@ 7 cubic feet per second ( 0 @.@ 19 m3 / s ) in the wet season ; urban runoff has raised the creek 's year @-@ round base flow to close to 9 @.@ 2 cubic feet per second ( 0 @.@ 26 m3 / s ) at the mouth , with routine surges of more than 700 cubic feet per second ( 20 m3 / s ) in the winter . The United States Geological Survey had two stream gauges on the creek — one at the mouth in Laguna Beach , and one at the El Toro Road bridge near Mission Viejo . The Laguna Beach gauge was in operation from 1983 to 1986 , and the El Toro gauge was operational from 1931 to 1980 . The former received runoff from about 95 percent of the watershed , while the latter received runoff from 7 @.@ 91 square miles ( 20 @.@ 49 km2 ) , or 26 percent of the watershed area . 
 The largest flow recorded at the Laguna Beach streamflow gauge was 5 @,@ 400 cubic feet per second ( 150 m3 / s ) with a water depth of 11 @.@ 3 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) on March 1 , 1983 . The 1983 flood was caused by an El Niño event causing heavy runoff from the overdeveloped watershed . Damage was worst at the mouth of Aliso Canyon , which contains the Aliso Creek Inn and several other structures . On February 16 , 1986 , 2 @,@ 880 cubic feet per second ( 82 m3 / s ) was recorded , and 2 @,@ 870 cubic feet per second ( 81 m3 / s ) was recorded on October 1 , 1983 . 
 The largest flow recorded at El Toro was 2 @,@ 500 cubic feet per second ( 71 m3 / s ) on February 24 , 1969 , with a water depth of 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) . On January 5 , 1979 , the second largest flow , 2 @,@ 450 cubic feet per second ( 69 m3 / s ) , was recorded , and 1 @,@ 950 cubic feet per second ( 55 m3 / s ) on February 6 , 1937 . There was another nearby gauge — now out of service — at the Jeronimo Road crossing just downstream of El Toro . Before it was taken out of service in the 1980s , it frequently recorded periods of extremely low or nonexistent flow for most of the year . 
 The dramatic change in Aliso Creek flows from the 1960s onwards can be seen in streamflow data from the El Toro gauge . From 1931 to 1960 , the average peak flow was 511 cubic feet per second ( 14 @.@ 5 m3 / s ) — though peaks recorded ranged from zero to 1 @,@ 950 cubic feet per second ( 55 m3 / s ) . Between 1960 and 1980 , the average peak flow was 1 @,@ 178 cubic feet per second ( 33 @.@ 4 m3 / s ) , nearly twice the average before 1960 . Urban runoff now constitutes nearly 80 percent of the creek 's dry season flow — 7 @.@ 2 cubic feet per second ( 0 @.@ 20 m3 / s ) — and natural runoff , including springs in the Santa Ana Mountains , now supply a negligible amount of the creek 's water . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Most of Southern California , including all of Orange County , was periodically part of the Pacific Ocean ; the most recent epoch was approximately 10 million years ago ( MYA ) . The Santa Ana Mountains , which now border the creek to the north and east , began their uplift about 5 @.@ 5 million years ago along the Elsinore Fault . Aliso Creek formed about this time , running from the mountains across the broad coastal plain to the Pacific . 
 About 1 @.@ 22 million years ago , the San Joaquin Hills along the Orange County coast began their uplift along a blind thrust fault ( the San Joaquin Hills blind thrust ) extending south from the Los Angeles Basin . As Aliso Creek was an antecedent stream , or one that had formed prior to the mountains ' uplift , it cut a water gap through the rising mountains that today is Aliso Canyon . The same phenomenon occurred to the north with Laguna Canyon and San Diego Creek , and to the south at San Juan Creek . The uplift also caused Aliso Creek 's largest tributary , Sulphur Creek , to turn north to join Aliso Creek instead of flowing south to Salt Creek . The Wisconsinian era was responsible for shaping the watershed to its present @-@ day form , with deep side canyons and broad alluvial valleys . 
 During the last glacial period ( 110 @,@ 000 to 10 @,@ 000 years ago ) , especially in the Wisconsinian glaciation ( 31 @,@ 000 to 10 @,@ 000 years ago ) , the climate of Southern California changed radically from arid to wet , to a climate likely similar to the present @-@ day Pacific Northwest . Prodigious rainfall gradually turned the small streams of the region into large and powerful rivers . It was this surge in volume that allowed Aliso Creek and other rivers to cut through the San Joaquin Hills . A 400 @-@ foot ( 120 m ) drop in sea level escalated the process , allowing the rivers to flow more rapidly and have more erosive power . As sea levels rose after the Wisconsinian glaciation , the water gaps the rivers had cut through the San Joaquin Hills , including Aliso Canyon , became fjord @-@ like inlets . Aliso Creek and these other streams deposited sediments into the inlets , turning them into flat @-@ floored alluvial valleys with an elevation very close to sea level . Eventually , the sediment deposited met the coastline . By then , the rivers and streams had diminished to their original flow before the glaciation . 
 In the wake of the periodic inundation of Southern California by the ocean , most of the Aliso Creek watershed is underlain by several layers of marine sedimentary strata , the oldest dating from the Eocene ( 55 @.@ 8 – 33 @.@ 9 MYA ) and the most recent , the Pliocene ( 5 @.@ 33 – 2 @.@ 59 MYA ) . These alluvial sediments range from 13 to 36 feet ( 4 @.@ 0 to 11 @.@ 0 m ) in depth . Generally throughout the watershed , there are five major soil and rock outcrop types — Capistrano sandy loam , Cieneba sandy loam , Marina loamy sand , <unk> sandy loam , and Cieneba @-@ rock outcrop . The water table ranges from 6 to 20 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 to 6 @.@ 1 m ) deep .

 The Aliso Creek drainage basin lies in the south central part of Orange County , roughly halfway between the Santa Ana River and the Orange – San Diego County boundary . It is a roughly spoon shaped area of 30 @.@ 4 square miles ( 79 km2 ) , comprising generally hilly and sometimes mountainous land . The watershed borders five major Orange County watersheds : Santiago Creek to the north , San Diego Creek to the west , Laguna Canyon to the southwest , Salt Creek to the southeast , and San Juan Creek to the east . To be more specific , the boundary with San Diego Creek is drained to the west by two tributaries of San Diego Creek — Serrano Creek and the La Cañada Wash . Two tributaries of San Juan Creek — Oso Creek and Trabuco Creek — border Aliso Creek to the northeast and southeast . 
 As of 2004 , the Aliso Creek watershed had a population of 149 @,@ 087 . Nine communities were established in the creek 's watershed as it was developed in the 20th century . By 2001 seven of them had become cities ( from mouth to source , Laguna Beach , Laguna Niguel , Aliso Viejo , Laguna Hills , Laguna Woods , Lake Forest , and Mission Viejo ) , and the last two , Foothill Ranch and Portola Hills , were incorporated into the city of Lake Forest in 2000 . The largest urban area in the basin is in the middle , where Interstate 5 bisects the watershed east to west . The northern boundary of this urban area stretches a little beyond California State Route 241 and the southern boundary is near California State Route 73 in the south . This area consists primarily of Lake Forest , Laguna Woods , and Laguna Hills . 
 The Loma Ridge of the Santa Ana Mountains runs east to west in the far northeastern corner of the watershed , forming the water divide with Santiago Creek . The San Joaquin Hills are at the southwestern portion of the watershed , following the coastline , and subranges within form the divides with Laguna Canyon and Salt Creeks . While the Santa Ana Mountains rise to 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) or more , the San Joaquin Hills top out at 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) at Temple Hill ( " Top of the World " ) , which lies to the north of Aliso Canyon — the water gap in the San Joaquin Hills through which Aliso Creek passes . Most of the hills rise to only 600 feet ( 180 m ) or 700 feet ( 210 m ) . The largest body of water in the watershed , Sulphur Creek Reservoir , is located to the northeast of Aliso Canyon . 
 = = = Bacterial pollution = = = 
 Aliso Creek 's watershed , as well as most of Orange County , saw a rapid jump in urban development from the 1960s onward , which introduced increased flow , non @-@ native vegetation , and high bacterial levels to the creek , severely hurting its ecology . The creek is part of the Clean Water Act list of impaired waters , which is defined as " impaired by one or more pollutants that do not meet one or more water quality standards " . It is said that Aliso Creek is one of the " most publicized " streams on the list . As of 2001 , the average annual precipitation in the San Juan Hydrological Unit , which Aliso Creek is part of , was 16 @.@ 42 inches ( 417 mm ) . 
 Bacteria affecting the water quality mainly consist of different types of fecal coliforms , with a high level of E. coli bacteria . This comes from pet waste , fertilizer , manure , and other organic pollutants that are washed into the creek , raising the average bacteria level 34 percent higher than levels declared safe under California law . This in turn affects recreation at popular Aliso Creek Beach at the creek 's mouth , violating state swimming standards 99 percent of the time , especially during storm events , as beachgoers are warned to avoid the creek for 72 hours ( 3 days ) after a major storm event . 
 According to the county health department , the number of bacteria in the creek , especially at the freshwater lagoon at its mouth , frequently exceeds limits set by California law . 
 According to the Los Angeles Times , " County health officials acknowledge that the bacterial count at the mouth of the creek — which curls into a warm @-@ water stagnant pond that flushes out onto the beach — is at times alarmingly high , often surpassing the legal limit for California . As a result , the area where the creek meets the sea , and the creek itself , are considered permanently off limits to swimmers and bear prominent signs that warn of the dangers of trespassing into such toxic waters . Nevertheless , people do , almost daily . Officials from the Orange County Environmental Health Department say that skin rashes , infections , " pink eye " and other assorted ailments are not uncommon to those who use Aliso Beach and , unwittingly , come in contact with the creek and its invisible bacteria ... " . The problems facing the creeks are blamed on urbanization , which has deprived the creeks of needed sediment while increasing pollution . 
 = = = Other pollutants = = = 
 Chlorine is responsible for the degradation of fish and shrimp in the creek . The sources for chlorine in urban runoff include irrigation and car washing . The only remaining fish species in the creek is carp , which can withstand high amounts of chlorine . Carp up to 18 inches ( 1 @.@ 5 feet / 45 cm ) long have been found in Aliso Creek near the mouth . Temperatures of the creek near the mouth have been known to exceed 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) , although the temperature at the outflow is often much colder because it has been mixed with seawater . 
 Changes of sediment patterns in the creek have also created another problem . Stemming from the construction of structures interfering with stream flow , and increased runoff from the urban areas adjoining the creek , excessive erosion has created problems not limited to just the creek . The creek is eroding material from its bed and transporting it to the ocean , but naturally , sediment from the whole watershed flowed towards the main stem via a complex network of tributaries . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warned in a 1997 study that up to $ 4 @.@ 2 million in damage occurs per year as a result of the pollution of Aliso Creek and its neighbor San Juan Creek . This includes physical damage to creek banks , bridges , pipes and other creekside structures . 
 In the upper portion of the watershed , spectacular erosion @-@ related events have occurred at English Canyon Creek , where water flowing at high velocity around a bend during a flood caused several landslides in the 1990s .

 The Aliso Creek watershed includes portions of the Cleveland National Forest in the upper watershed , and two major regional parks — the 3 @,@ 879 @-@ acre ( 1 @,@ 570 ha ) Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park and its adjoining Aliso Creek Beach , one of the county 's most popular beaches with over one million annual visitors ; and the 236 @-@ acre ( 96 ha ) Laguna Niguel Regional Park , which borders Sulphur Creek . Because of its shallowness and erratic flow , Aliso Creek is not navigable even in the winter and spring ( rainy season ) ; the only spot in the entire watershed where boating is possible is Sulphur Creek Reservoir . A mostly paved trail , the Aliso Creek Trail , follows the creek from Aliso Canyon to the Cleveland National Forest . 
 The only major fishing spot in the Aliso Creek 's watershed is the 44 @-@ acre ( 18 ha ) Sulphur Creek Reservoir , formed by a large earthfill dam across Sulphur Creek inside Laguna Niguel Regional Park . The lake is regularly stocked with catfish , bass , bluegill , and trout during the winter months . Any other location in the watershed will probably yield only the bottom @-@ dweller carp . 
 Most of the trails in the watershed are biking and equestrian trails located in the lower portion of the watershed , in the immensely popular Aliso Canyon and its tributary , Wood Canyon . Aside from the main Aliso Creek Trail , the Wood Canyon Trail parallels a tributary of Aliso Creek ( Wood Canyon Creek ) . There is also a bikeway along Sulphur Creek and along parts of English Canyon . 
 = = Wildlife = = 
 = = = Historic = = = 
 Before agricultural and later urban development of the watershed , live oak , sycamore , and alder trees lined the banks of Aliso Creek and its major tributaries , specifically Wood Canyon , Sulphur and English Canyon creeks , in a rich riparian zone . Coyotes , mountain lions , and other large mammals were found throughout the Aliso Creek watershed , especially in the mountainous areas in the San Joaquin Hills and Santa Ana Mountains . These animals can still be found in some number , but they are mostly confined to the wilderness areas that are surrounded by residential development . These " islands " of native vegetation and wildlife still support many native Southern California organisms . As the creek was perennial , the riparian zone surrounding the creek likely was similar to that of San Juan Creek to the south . 
 Researchers and long @-@ time residents of the lower Aliso Creek watershed have argued for many years over the presence of steelhead trout in Aliso Creek . Up until 2006 the National Marine Fisheries Service stated that Aliso Creek is a " [ coastal basin ] with no evidence of historical or extant of O. mykiss in anadromous waters . " Contrary to that , a 1998 major study co @-@ authored by the US Army Corps of Engineer and US Fish & Wildlife Service declared that steelhead had inhabited the creek until around 1972 when increased density ( urbanization ) resulted in poor water quality conditions ( pollutants and low oxygen levels ) that drove the migrational fish out . 
 On February 20 , 2009 , in a written rebuke , chastising an Aliso Creek water rights applicant ( South Coast Water District ) a formal letter sent by NOAA Regional Manager Rodney McGinnis to Antonio Barrales of the State Water Resources Control Board , Water Rights Division , revised that 2006 assessment . Carbon copied was California Fish & Game ( Mary Larson ) plus US Fish & Wildlife Service ( Christine Medak ) . This was due to 9 years of constant petitioning by the South Orange County environmental protectionist group Clean Water Now ( CWN ) led by Founder and Executive Director Roger E. Bütow , Board member Michael Hazzard , Joanne Sutch ( Laguna Beach Beautification Committee ) and <unk> Hertz ( Planet Laguna ) . Frank Selby , owner of His & Hers Fly Shop in Costa Mesa , was interviewed by Oc Register and <unk> Times reporters , he confirmed his own steelhead takings from the 1950s and 60s , last sighting in 1972 . Frank then sent a letter to <unk> ( June 2008 ) titled " Regarding Aliso Creek Steelhead . " He was also personally interviewed by the CWN Board to confirm actual sightings and taking . 
 NMFS then reversed itself and declared that there was sufficient , credible information to declare that Aliso Creek had been steelhead habitat and was added to the Distinct Population Segment List under the jurisdictional domain of NOAA . It is now considered a candidate for re @-@ colonization . 
 During the prolonged 9 @-@ year dispute that began in 2000 , Bütow and his working group " Friends of the Aliso Creek Steelhead " provided authentic Native American ( Juañeno ) anecdotes of takings , pictures by upstream fishermen with their catches and other personal accounts by longtime local residents that helped convince the State . It was a negotiated truce between Bütow and NOAA : Only the lower 7 miles of the creek was eventually listed because its conditions were amenable to historical populations . The habitat " termination line " was drawn at about Aliso Creek where it crosses an arterial road : Pacific Parkway in Aliso Viejo . In fact , Mary Larson ( steelhead restoration coordinator for CF & G ) , declared to reporters when the ruling was reversed that it was obviously true , its historical presence a " duh , no @-@ brainer moment . " Many anglers in the 1960s and 1970s reported taking tens or even hundreds of steelhead trout from Aliso Creek 's estuary and Aliso Creek Canyon ( approximately 4 miles ) before suburban development began . This indicates that there was a " possible run or population " of steelhead in Aliso Creek at some point . The creek is also inhabited by bottom @-@ dwellers such as carp , and historically shrimp and other benthic organisms were found throughout perennial pools in the Aliso Creek watershed . Historically , a large population of tidewater goby ( 10 @,@ 000 – 15 @,@ 000 ) was documented at the creek 's mouth by Swift et al .. ( 1989 ) , from a study period that ranged from March 1973 to January 1977 . The tidewater goby , which depended on the transient lagoon at the mouth for survival , has declined in number because of modifications to its habitat . 
 = = = Human impact = = = 
 Since urbanization began in the 1960s , sudden high and sediment @-@ lacking flows of polluted water began to destroy the native riparian vegetation once found along much of the creek . Exotic plants , including tobacco tree , castor bean , pampas grass , periwinkle , and Artichoke thistle , but most notably the giant reed , then replaced the historic live oaks , sycamores and alders as riparian vegetation . These plants have crowded out native vegetation , and in the case of giant reed , crowded out native animals — giant reed does not provide habitat for any native Southern California animals . These invasive species are most prevalent along upper Sulphur Creek ( Sulphur Creek Reservoir prevents these plants from spreading downstream ) , much of the Aliso Creek mainstem , and some parts of Wood Canyon Creek . 
 Many of the trees in Aliso Creek 's riparian zone were cut down in the Spanish Mission period to construct buildings , ships , and other projects . According to the Flood Protection Corridor Program of the Costa Machado Water Act of 2000 , " Aliso Creek was one of the few streams that contained water most of the year , even during the pre @-@ development period . There are documents describing explorers mooring their ships outside the mouth of the river and harvesting large timbers from the river area . Such large timbers could only be available from a relatively lush environment in which water was somewhat plentiful . " Some trees survived into the early 20th century , then a second decline of unknown cause began — either erosion or floods in the creek were responsible for their destruction , or the water table has lowered out of reach of the trees ' roots . The water table began a drastic decline in the 1960s , after the watershed began to become urbanized . 
 Although historically many fish species used Aliso Creek , the only remaining one is carp , which is known to survive in areas with high toxicity . Bird life was also abundant in the watershed — and 137 species remain in the less developed areas of the watershed . Some of these birds include California least tern , least Bell 's vireo , southwestern willow flycatcher , California <unk> , and western snowy plover . Remaining habitat for native wildlife is now primarily along Wood Canyon Creek , in the upper reaches of Aliso Creek , and along some parts of English Canyon . 
 Aside from carp , several species of fish and amphibians still inhabited the creek up to the 1980s , when floods destroyed much of the remaining riparian habitat . These included the mosquito fish , bluegill , bass , and channel catfish , as well as several species of native frogs . After the floods , most of these species were reported to have disappeared completely .

 It is believed that in Native American times , Aliso Creek served as part of an important tribal boundary — between the Tongva in the north and the Acjachemen ( or Juaneño ) tribe in the south . The Tongva 's territory extended north , past the Santa Ana River and San Gabriel River , into present @-@ day Los Angeles County , while the Acjachemen 's smaller territory extended from Aliso Creek south , past San Juan Creek , and to the vicinity of San Mateo Creek in present @-@ day San Diego County . The creek 's perennial flow made it a likely spot for Indian settlement , although the Tongva 's main settlements were near the San Gabriel River and the Acjachemen mostly lived at the confluence of San Juan Creek and Trabuco Creek . Even so , some 70 major archaeological sites have been discovered along the creek , and it is believed that there was once an Acjachemen Indian village near the confluence of Aliso Creek and Sulphur Creek , named Niguili , which means " a large spring " in the native <unk> dialect . The spring still exists near the intersection of Alicia Parkway and Highlands Road in present @-@ day Laguna Niguel , about a mile ( 1 @.@ 6 ) km east of Aliso Creek 's confluence with Sulphur Creek . 
 The creek 's use as a tribal boundary is disputed . As other southern California Native Americans have done , a tribe typically claimed both sides of a stream or river — and used drainage divides as boundaries instead . However , the presence of Aliso Canyon , a steep and difficult @-@ to @-@ traverse gorge , suggests the opposite . Kroeber ( 1907 ) was the first to support this theory , and many other archaeologists have followed as well . The Juaneño disagree , arguing that their boundary stretches north to the northern drainage divide of the Aliso Creek watershed , which supports the practice of claiming both sides of a stream . 
 = = = Spanish explorers and missionaries = = = 
 In 1769 , the Portola expedition camped near Aliso Creek on July 24 – 25 , having come north from the San Juan Capistrano area along the route of today 's Interstate 5 . These first Spanish explorers were accompanied by Franciscan missionaries who took control over nearly all of the coastal Native American groups . They later established Mission San Gabriel Arcángel and Mission San Juan Capistrano near the main native population centers , seeking to convert them to Christianity . Most of the native population was moved to these two missions — the Spanish called the Tongva <unk> and the Acjachemen , the Juaneño , after these two missions . The Spanish began farming and ranching practices on many of the fertile floodplains surrounding the only perennial streams in the area — San Juan and Trabuco Creek , Aliso Creek , and the Santa Ana , San Gabriel and Los Angeles rivers to the north . Many of the trees in the riparian zones surrounding these creeks — specifically Aliso Creek — were cut down , and it was said that the trees near the " river [ ' s ] " mouth were especially tall and there were written accounts of Spanish ships mooring in the large bay at the outlet of Aliso Canyon and men going ashore to chop down and take away these trees for constructing mission buildings , ships and other structures . 
 = = = The Mexican period = = = 
 Mexico won independence from Spain in 1822 , keeping the Alta California province , and secularized the missions in the 1830s . Former mission lands were divided into private land grants . In 1842 , Juan Avila received the 13 @,@ 316 @-@ acre ( 53 @.@ 89 km2 ) Rancho Niguel grant . The name of the rancho was partially derived from a corruption of the original name of the village , Niguili . ( The rancho name later became part of the name of the city of Laguna Niguel . )

 Following the Mexican – American War , California was annexed by the United States , becoming the 31st state in 1850 . In 1871 , the first white settler along Aliso Creek , Eugene Salter , claimed 152 acres ( 0 @.@ 62 km2 ) along the lower creek , inside Aliso Canyon . The following year the 152 acres ( 0 @.@ 62 km2 ) were acquired by George and Sarah Thurston , homesteaders who converted the mouth of the creek into an orchard irrigated by its waters for roughly the next half century . 
 = = = Urbanization and development = = = 
 In 1895 , Rancho Niguel was acquired by rancher Lewis Moulton ( 1854 – 1938 ) and his partner , Jean Pierre Daguerre ( 1856 – 1911 ) . The rancho remained under their ownership for approximately thirty @-@ eight years , and the rancho continued to be owned by the Moulton family until the 1960s . Rancho Niguel was eventually assimilated into Laguna Niguel , Aliso Viejo , Laguna Hills , and Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park . 
 By the 1920s , Aliso Creek was already being experimented with as a municipal water source . In 1924 , the City of Laguna Beach drilled wells into gravel deposits near the mouth of the creek , in order to provide drinking water . Just four years later , the unusually high and unexplained presence of chloride in the water prompted the city to abandon Aliso Creek as a water source . Taking advantage of the creek 's high winter surges , ranging from 0 to 404 acre feet ( 0 to 498 @,@ 327 m3 ) monthly , local resident A. J. Stead proposed in 1934 to build a dam very near the mouth of the creek , forming a reservoir with a capacity of 2 @,@ 650 acre feet ( 3 @,@ 270 @,@ 000 m3 ) and safe annual yield of 150 acre feet ( 190 @,@ 000 m3 ) . Although the proposal was accepted , the results are unknown — there is no remaining trace of these works today . 
 By the late 1960s , increasing runoff in the creek from the growing cities in the watershed begun to spell ecological problems and severe erosion for the creek . Although a series of flood control channels upstream of Aliso Creek Road ( near Aliso Canyon ) had already begun to prevent erosion in those heavily developed areas , the creek eroded to depths of 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) or more in any unlined areas . 
 In 1969 a flow control and erosion mitigation project for Aliso Creek was begun , requiring the construction of two concrete drop structures on the creek . These two vertical barriers , 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) high and 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) long , were built both upstream and downstream of Aliso Creek Road . Several grouted riprap structures were also constructed between and downstream of these drops . 
 A small dam was built about 1 @.@ 4 miles ( 2 @.@ 3 km ) downstream of Aliso Creek Road in the 1990s — inside Aliso Canyon — as part of a " mitigation bank project " . This project , known as <unk> ( Aliso Creek Wildlife Habitat Enhancement Project ) was intended to provide water to 70 acres ( 0 @.@ 28 km2 ) of former riparian areas now several feet higher than the eroded channel of the creek . It was conceived and jointly funded by the county and the Mission Viejo Company . The dam was also supposed to control further erosion downstream . Due to faulty design , however , the dam failed to prevent erosion , which has continued to undermine structures throughout the canyon . The grouted riprap structure is about 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) high and 100 feet ( 30 m ) long , and aside from impounding water , captures debris and temporarily controls wet season flows . The building of these modifications , as well as dry weather runoff from seven municipal storm sewer systems , began to contribute to the infamous pollution of Aliso Creek .

 In 1927 Laguna Beach became the first city to be incorporated in the Aliso Creek watershed and the second in Orange County . At this time , prior to the 1930s , aside from some farming and ranching practices , the watershed was largely unpopulated . At the end of that decade , the watershed still remained less than 1 percent developed . Up to the 1960s and 1970s , barely 15 percent of the watershed was developed , but by 1990 , after doubling its rate in the past two decades , the watershed was roughly 60 percent developed . The cities of Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel were incorporated in 1988 and 1989 , respectively . By the end of the 20th century , more than 70 percent of the watershed was developed . The newest city in the watershed , Aliso Viejo , was incorporated in 2001 . 
 The Cleveland National Forest , the oldest protected area in the Aliso Creek watershed , was created in 1908 , and the next major park to be created was Laguna Niguel Regional Park in 1973 . Land for Aliso and Wood Canyons Regional Park was first secured in April 1979 with 3 @,@ 400 acres ( 14 km2 ) , and small increments were added to the park until the early 1990s forming a total of 3 @,@ 879 acres ( 15 @.@ 70 km2 ) . Also in the 1990s , Aliso and Wood Canyons became part of the Laguna Coast Wilderness , which stretches north to Crystal Cove State Park . 
 = = = Flooding and mitigation = = = 
 Like most other coastal Orange County streams , the watershed of Aliso Creek is now heavily urbanized . With 70 percent of the original land surface now underneath impermeable surfaces such as pavement and buildings , far more runoff now enters the creek — not only inducing an increased year @-@ round flow , but much larger rainy season flows . In the 1920s and 1930s , devastating floods wreaked havoc on much of southern California ; the Los Angeles Flood of 1938 was the most famous flooding episode of this period . 
 The Orange County Flood Control Act of 1927 was created in the wake of some of the earlier flooding events of this era . Dams and reservoirs , some of the largest of which include Irvine Lake and the Sulphur Creek Reservoir , were the first features to be constructed following the passage of this act . Starting from the 1960s , most Orange County rivers , including Aliso Creek , were channelized . Some , like the Santa Ana River , were entirely lined with concrete , but Aliso Creek retains a natural riverbed in most parts despite being bound to a narrow channel . 
 Several tributaries of Aliso Creek — the Dairy Fork , Aliso Hills Channel , Munger Creek , and other smaller ones — have been replaced by storm drains . Wood Canyon Creek remains much like its original condition , despite degradation due to polluted water . Sulphur Creek has been channelized and diverted into culverts in several stretches , and English Canyon Creek has received some riprap stabilization and bank protection . 
 Although there are no major flood control dams on Aliso Creek itself , there are 19 drop structures , and while doing nothing to reduce the creek 's rainy season surges , the drop structures were constructed to mitigate the catastrophic erosion that came with the creek 's increased flow . Although the creek has a wide floodplain throughout most of Aliso Canyon , a major bottleneck lies at the south end of the canyon where a sharp bend in the creek is constricted between crowded development and steep cliffs . In flooding events , this area generally sustains heavy damage . 
 Another major era of floods lasted from the 1980s until the early 21st century . The 1983 El Niño season brought unprecedented rainfall that produced a flow of 5 @,@ 400 cubic feet per second ( 150 m3 / s ) from the creek , an all @-@ time high . The creek overflowed its banks and flooded up to 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) deep in places . There were five large floods throughout the 1990s , including one in 1998 that reputedly destroyed six footbridges . The years of 2004 and 2005 again saw heavy rainfall .

 Sutton Valence Castle is a ruined medieval fortification in the village of Sutton Valence in Kent , England . It was built in the second half of the 12th century , probably by Baldwin of Bethune , the Count of Aumale . Overlooking a strategic route to the coast , the original castle probably comprised an inner and an outer bailey and a protective barbican , with a three @-@ storey high keep on its southern side . It was passed into the Marshal and de Montfort families , before being given by King Henry III to his half @-@ brother William de Valence in 1265 , from whom the castle takes its current name . It was abandoned in the early 14th century and fell into ruin . In the 21st century the castle is managed by English Heritage , and the remains of the keep are open to the public .

 Sutton Valence Castle was probably built in the second half of the 12th century by the Counts of Aumale , most likely by Baldwin of Bethune , but perhaps alternatively by William le Gros , Baldwin 's father @-@ in @-@ law . The castle was built on a commanding position overlooking the strategic route between the towns of Maidstone , Rye and Old <unk> and the location was originally known as Town Sutton . The stone keep of the castle was constructed around 1200 . 
 In 1203 , Baldwin gave the castle to his daughter Alicia on her marriage to William Marshal , the Earl of Pembroke , who later remarried , passing the property to his second wife , Eleanor . After William 's death , Eleanor married Simon de Montfort , the Earl of Leicester . Simon led a rebellion against King Henry III during the Second Barons ' War , but was killed at the Battle of Evesham in 1265 , after which Eleanor was stripped of the castle . 
 The King gave Sutton Valence to William de Valence , his half @-@ brother , who had supported him during the conflict . Under William , the castle acquired its current name of Sutton Valence . Aymer de Valence , his son , inherited the castle in 1307 . The <unk> travelled around their estates , increasingly focusing their attention on a handful of their various great houses , and stayed at Sutton Valence on at least several occasions . 
 After Aymer 's death in 1324 , the castle passed by marriage to Lawrence , Lord Hastings , and was held in the Hastings family until 1390 , when Reginald Lord Grey de Ruthin acquired it . There are few historical records of the castle beyond this point , but it appears to have been abandoned in the early 14th century and by the 15th century had become ruined .

 By the end of the 18th century , the historian Edward Hasted described Sutton Valence Castle as being " now almost covered with ivy , and the branches of the trees which sprout out from the walls of it . " Archaeological excavations were carried out at the site during the mid @-@ 1950s with the assistance of Maidstone Museum and the local Sutton Valence School , focusing on the castle keep . The castle was placed into the guardianship of the state in 1976 ; it is now owned by English Heritage and conservation work was done on the ruins in the 1980s . It is protected under UK law as a Grade II listed building and as a Scheduled Monument .

 Sutton Valence Castle occupied a spur of the Chart Hills , adjacent to the village of Sutton Valence , and probably comprised an inner and an outer bailey and a protective barbican . Visitors would have entered through an eastern barbican , coming through to an outer bailey ; these features only survive as earthworks . A dry ditch protected the inner bailey , which was approximately 300 by 34 metres ( 984 by 112 ft ) across , positioned on the southern side of the site . It probably included a hall , chapel and kitchen , but only the castle keep now survives . The keep is 11 metres ( 36 ft ) square , with walls 2 @.@ 4 metres ( 7 ft 10 in ) thick , built from ragstone and flint rubble and surviving up to 7 metres ( 23 ft ) high . It was originally 20 metres ( 66 ft ) tall , with at least three storeys , and entered through an external staircase leading to a doorway in the first floor . The building had a corner tower , in which was a spiral staircase linking the floors , and had clasping buttresses at the corners .

 John Hummer ( born May 4 , 1948 ) is a venture capitalist and retired professional basketball player who was an original member of the Buffalo Braves after starring for the Princeton Tigers men 's basketball team . He also led his high school to the 1966 Virginia State 1A championship and helped Princeton earn a 1967 @-@ 68 co @-@ Ivy League Championship as well as a 1968 @-@ 69 outright Ivy League Championship . Over the course of his basketball career , he was coached by four National Basketball Hall of Fame members . 
 In college , Hummer was a three @-@ time All @-@ Ivy League selection ( first @-@ team : 1969 & 1970 , second team : 1968 ) .

Although Hummer set no statistical records , his name continues to be ranked high in the Princeton record book by many statistical measures . 
 He played six seasons in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) for the Braves , Chicago Bulls and Seattle SuperSonics . He was the 15th overall selection in the 1970 NBA Draft and the first draft choice in the history of the Braves franchise . As a Braves draft choice , he was a somewhat controversial pick in a draft year with two All @-@ American local products available . During his NBA career , he played for Hall of Famers Dolph Schayes , Bill Russell and Jack Ramsay . 
 After his professional basketball career ended , he went to Stanford University to get an MBA in 1980 . In 1989 , Ann Winblad and he founded Hummer Winblad Venture Partners , a venture capital firm focusing on software companies .

 Hummer attended Washington @-@ Lee High School in Arlington , Virginia . Following in the footsteps of his brother Ed Hummer , he led W @-@ L to the 1966 Virginia 1A state title as a high school senior . Ed had led the team to the 1962 and 1963 titles . His nephew ( Ed 's son Ian ) was a freshman on the 2009 – 10 Princeton team . 
 In Hummer 's sophomore season at Princeton , the team was co @-@ champion of the Ivy League with a 20 – 6 ( 12 – 3 Ivy ) record . Despite the fact that Princeton had three of the five first @-@ team All @-@ Ivy team members , plus second @-@ team member Hummer , they lost the one @-@ game league playoff to the Jim McMillian @-@ led 1968 Columbia Lions . That year the team rose to as high as 8th in the AP Poll . This was the first of thirteen Ivy League championships for head coach Pete Carril . 
 The following season , the team accumulated a 19 – 7 ( 14 – 0 ) record and participated in the 1969 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament . They lost to St. John 's in the tournament , but Hummer was joined by Geoff Petrie on the first @-@ team All @-@ Ivy squad . This was the first of eleven NCAA tournament appearance for Carril . It was also the first of three 14 – 0 conference champions for Carril . 
 As a senior , Hummer was first @-@ team All @-@ Ivy , but the Tigers placed third in the conference to the undefeated ( in Ivy League games ) Corky Calhoun @-@ led Penn Quakers and McMillian 's Lions . Although Princeton did not appear in the 1970 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament , they hosted Penn 's game . All three of his varsity years were spent under Carril . Again , following in the <unk> of his brother who had served as Princeton captain of the 1966 – 67 team , John was co @-@ captain for the 1969 – 70 team along with classmate Petrie . Hummer was honored with the team 's B. Franklin Bunn ’ 07 Award for play , sportsmanship and influence that contributed most to the sport . 
 During his career , he shared the spotlight with Petrie and did not set any statistical records at a school and conference where Bill Bradley continues to dominate the record books . Over the course of his career , Hummer was the 9th Tiger to accumulate 1000 career points ( 1031 in 67 games ) and he continued to rank seventh in school history with a 15 @.@ 4 points / game average through the 2009 – 10 season .

The 1970 draft included two promising All @-@ American local @-@ Buffalo area talents : St. Bonaventure University 's Buffalo @-@ born Bob Lanier and Niagara University 's Calvin Murphy . Murphy was a fan favorite that many local fans hoped the Braves would select . However , Braves General Manager Eddie Donovan doubted the 5 feet 9 inches ( 1 @.@ 75 m ) Murphy could make it in the NBA . The Baltimore Bullets traded to improve their draft position on the day of the March 23 , 1970 NBA draft . They traded their # 15 selection and Mike Davis to the expansion Buffalo Braves for the # 9 selection . That day , the Braves selected Hummer with the 15th pick . Hummer averaged 11 @.@ 3 points and 8 @.@ 9 rebounds for the 1970 – 71 Buffalo Braves during an average of 32 @.@ 6 minutes in 81 games played for coach Dolph Schayes . The 22 – 60 Braves finished fourth in the four @-@ team Atlantic Division . Hummer and the Braves struggled for two more seasons with 60 @-@ loss seasons .

 After the Braves selected Ernie DiGregorio in the 1973 NBA Draft to complement 1972 NBA Draft selection Bob McAdoo , it was clear the team was going to change to fast @-@ paced offense to leverage DiGregorio 's skills . Hummer was more of a defensive player . Prior to the 1973 – 74 NBA season , Hummer was packaged with a 1974 NBA Draft 2nd round pick and a 1975 NBA Draft 2nd round pick in a trade that sent him to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for Gar Heard and Kevin Kunnert . The deal was part of the resume that earned <unk> the NBA Executive of the Year Award .

 During the season ( on January 7 ) , he was traded by the Bulls to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for a 1975 NBA draft 2nd round selection . Russell 's SuperSonics ( 1974 – 75 and 1975 – 76 ) were the only playoff teams that he played in the postseason with . In the 1975 NBA Playoffs , the Sonics defeated the Detroit Pistons 2 – 1 in the first round before losing to the Golden State Warriors 4 – 2 . Hummer appeared in six of the nine playoff games that year , but accumulated no points . The following season the Sonics earned a bye in the first round of the 1976 NBA Playoffs where they lost to the Phoenix Suns . Hummer appeared in three of these games .

 New York State Route 293 ( NY 293 ) is a 6 @.@ 82 @-@ mile ( 10 @.@ 98 km ) state highway located entirely within eastern Orange County , New York , in the United States .

It does not pass through any notable populated areas as most of the land around it is protected either as state parkland or US military reservation . However , it receives much traffic as the major route between the United States Military Academy at West Point and the New York State Thruway ( Interstate 87 or I @-@ 87 ) .

The gap in the designation was eliminated in 1928 when US 6 was realigned east of Port Jervis to follow most of its modern alignment ; however , from Woodbury to the Bear Mountain Bridge , US 6 followed what had been NY 37 from Central Valley to Highlands and overlapped with US 9W south from Highlands to the bridge .

 PA 997 was designated in 1928 between Mont Alto and US 30 in Fayetteville along Mont Alto Road . The same year , the present route between the Maryland border and Waynesboro became part of PA 316 while the section between Lurgan and Roxbury became part of PA 433 . PA 333 was designated in 1928 to run from US 30 in Chambersburg northeast to US 11 in Shippensburg , heading north to Pleasant Hall , west to Upper Strasburg , northeast to Roxbury , east to Newburg , and south to Shippensburg . By 1930 , PA 997 was extended south from Mont Alto to PA 16 in Waynesboro , while PA 333 was moved to a more direct alignment between Pleasant Hall and Roxbury ( running concurrent with PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury ) and PA 996 was designated onto the road between Scotland and Green Village . In 1937 , PA 997 was extended south to MD 60 at the Maryland border south of Waynesboro and northwest to US 11 in Green Village , replacing PA 996 between Scotland and Green Village , while the north end of PA 333 was cut back to PA 433 in Lurgan and PA 944 was designated onto the road between Roxbury and McCrea . PA 997 swapped alignments with PA 316 south of Waynesboro in 1941 , being rerouted to end at MD 64 at the Maryland border . PA 333 was rerouted to head southeast from Pleasant Hall to PA 433 in Culbertson in the 1940s , with a section of the former alignment south of Pleasant Hall <unk> for the Letterkenny Army Depot . PA 997 was extended north from Green Village to PA 233 in McCrea , replacing the entire length of PA 333 , PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury , and PA 944 between Roxbury and McCrea . The route was shifted east to its current alignment between Mont Alto and north of Fayetteville in 1977 .

 When routes were legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911 , what is now PA 997 between the Maryland border and Waynesboro was designated as part of Legislative Route 44 while a section of the current route south of Roxbury became part of Legislative Route 264 . At this time , an unpaved road ran between Waynesboro , Mont Alto , and Fayetteville . PA 997 was signed in 1928 from Mont Alto , where an unnumbered paved road continued south to Waynesboro , north to US 30 in Fayetteville , following Mont Alto Road . Upon designation , the entire length of PA 997 was paved . The present route between the Maryland border and Waynesboro was designated as part of PA 316 , which was paved , while PA 433 was designated onto the unpaved road between Lurgan and Roxbury . PA 333 was designated in 1928 to run from US 30 in Chambersburg northeast to US 11 in Shippensburg , heading north on North Franklin Street and Letterkenny Road to Pleasant Hall before heading west to Upper Strasburg , northeast to Roxbury , east to Newburg , and south to Shippensburg . Upon designation , PA 333 was paved between Chambersburg and Pleasant Hall and Newburg and Shippensburg and was unpaved between Pleasant Hall and Newburg . On February 25 , 1929 , a bill passed that authorized the state to take over the road between Newburg and McCrea . By 1930 , PA 997 was extended south from Mont Alto to PA 16 in Waynesboro , following a paved road . The same year , PA 333 was shifted east to a more direct alignment between Pleasant Hall and Roxbury that was under construction , running concurrent with PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury , while PA 996 was designated onto the paved road between Scotland and US 11 in Green Village . The former alignment of PA 333 became PA 633 ( now PA 533 ) between Pleasant Hall and Upper Strasburg and an unnumbered road between Upper Strasburg and Roxbury . At this time , the road between Mont Alto and Scotland was an unnumbered , unpaved road , the road between Green Village and Culbertson was an unnumbered , paved road , and the road between Roxbury and McCrea was an unnumbered , unpaved road . 
 In 1937 , PA 997 was extended south from Waynesboro to MD 60 at the Maryland border , following Potomac Street and Wayne Highway , and was extended northwest from Fayetteville to US 11 in Green Village , following Mont Alto Road , Main Street and Mount Pleasant Road before picking up its current alignment . PA 997 replaced the PA 996 designation between Scotland and Green Village . In addition , the north end of PA 333 was cut back to PA 433 near Lurgan , with PA 641 replacing the route between Roxbury and Newburg and PA 696 replacing the route between Newburg and Shippensburg , and an extended PA 944 was designated onto the road between Roxbury and McCrea . In the 1930s , the entire length of both PA 333 and PA 997 were paved along with PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury , PA 944 between Roxbury and McCrea , and the unnumbered road between Mont Alto and north of Fayetteville via Black Gap . In 1941 , PA 997 switched alignments with PA 316 south of Waynesboro , with PA 997 rerouted to head south along Clayton Avenue , State Hill road , and Anthony Highway to MD 64 at the Maryland border . In the 1940s , PA 333 was rerouted to head southeast from Pleasant Hall to PA 433 in Culbertson along a new paved road , with a section of the former route between Beautiful and Pleasant Hall removed for the Letterkenny Army Depot . In 1964 , PA 997 was extended north from Green Village to PA 233 in McCrea , replacing the entire length of PA 333 between Culbertson and Lurgan , the section of PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury , and the section of PA 944 between Roxbury and McCrea . In the 1960s , PA 997 was rerouted to bypass Scotland to the northeast , with the former alignment now unnumbered Main Street . In 1977 , PA 997 was moved off its alignment on Mont Alto Road , Main Street and Mount Pleasant Road and shifted east onto its current route via Black Gap .

 " Reflection " is a song written and produced by Matthew Wilder and David Zippel for the soundtrack of Disney 's 1998 animated film Mulan . In the film , the song is performed by Filipina singer and actress Lea Salonga as Fa Mulan . An accompanying music video for " Reflection " was included as a bonus to the Disney Gold Classic Collection DVD release of the film in 1998 . 
 A single version of the song was recorded by American singer Christina Aguilera and became her debut single . She was 17 at the time it was released . The single 's commercial success funded Aguilera 's debut album from RCA , in addition to gaining her credibility amongst established writers and producers . Releases of the single were limited , which resulted in the track charting only on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart , at number nineteen . An accompanying music video for the song was included on the DVD release of Mulan . Aguilera has performed the track on four televised performances , including at the CBS This Morning show , which saw her gain the attention of songwriter Diane Warren .

 Aguilera approached record label RCA , then having financial difficulties , and was told to contact Disney . After being given the opportunity to record " Reflection " , it was reported she had gained a record deal with RCA Records . After she was asked to hit a musical note required for " Reflection " , she thought that the song could be the gateway into an album deal . Aguilera spent hours recording a cover of Whitney Houston 's " Run to You " , which included the note she was asked to hit . After successfully hitting the note , which she called " the note that changed my life " , she was given the opportunity to record the song . Due to the success around the recording of " Reflection " , RCA wished for Aguilera to record and release an album by September 1998 to maintain the " hype " surrounding her at that time . The label laid the foundation for the album immediately and started presenting Aguilera with tracks for her debut album , which they later decided would have a January 1999 release . 
 Aguilera 's version of " Reflection " was released to adult contemporary radio on June 15 , 1998 . The song was released as a CD single in Japan on September 18 , 1999 . In 2000 , Aguilera recorded the Spanish version of " Reflection " titled " Mi Reflejo " which was adapted by Rudy Pérez for the album of the same name .

 = Althorp = 
 Althorp ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ) is a Grade I listed stately home , estate and small civil parish in Daventry District , Northamptonshire , England of about 13 @,@ 000 acres ( 5 @,@ 300 ha ) . By road it is about 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) northwest of the county town of Northampton and about 75 miles ( 121 km ) northwest of central London . It has been held by the prominent aristocratic Spencer family for more than 500 years , and has been owned by Charles Spencer , 9th Earl Spencer since 1992 . It was also the home of his sister , Lady Diana Spencer later Princess of Wales , before her marriage to Charles , Prince of Wales . 
 Althorp is mentioned as a small hamlet in the Domesday Book as " <unk> " , and by 1377 it had become a village with a population of more than fifty people . By 1505 there were no longer any tenants living there , and in 1508 , John Spencer purchased Althorp estate with the funds generated from his family 's sheep @-@ rearing business . Althorp became one of the prominent stately homes in England . The mansion dates to 1688 , replacing an earlier house that was once visited by Charles I. The Spencer family amassed an extensive art collection and other valuable household items . During the 18th century , the house became a major cultural hub in England , and parties were regularly held , attracting many prominent members of Great Britain 's ruling class . George John , 2nd Earl Spencer , who owned Althorp between 1783 and his death in 1834 , developed one of the largest private libraries in Europe at the house , which grew to over 100 @,@ 000 books by the 1830s . After falling on hard times , John Spencer , 5th Earl Spencer , known as the Red Earl , in 1892 sold much of the collection to Enriqueta Rylands , who was building the University of Manchester Library . Many of Althorp 's furnishings were sold off during the twentieth century , and between 1975 and 1992 alone approximately 20 % of the contents were auctioned . 
 The house at Althorp was a " classically beautiful " red brick Tudor building , but its appearance was radically altered , starting in 1788 , when the architect Henry Holland was commissioned to make extensive changes . Mathematical tiles were added to the exterior , encasing the brick , and four Corinthian pilasters were added to the front . The grand hall entrance to the house , Wootton Hall , was cited by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as " the noblest Georgian room in the county " . The Great Dining Room in the east wing extension of the house was added in 1877 to designs by John <unk> Anderson , its walls hung with faded , red damask silk . Numerous fireplaces and furnishings were brought to Althorp from Spencer House in London during the Blitz for safekeeping and still remain . The Picture Gallery stretches for 115 feet ( 35 m ) on the first floor of the west wing , and is one of the best remaining examples of the original Tudor oak woodwork and ambiance in the mansion . It has an extensive collection of portraits , including Anthony van Dyck 's War and Peace , a John de Critz portrait of James I , a Mary Beale portrait of Charles II , and many others . Some £ 2 million was spent on redecorating the house in the 1980s , during which time most of the religious paintings of Althorp were sold off . 
 In total , the grounds of Althorp estate contain 28 listed buildings and structures , including nine planting stones . The former falconry , now a Grade I listed building , was built in 1613 . Gardener 's House is listed as a Grade II * listed building in its own right , as are the Grade II listed West and East Lodges . The mustard @-@ yellow Grade II listed Stable Block , designed by architect Roger Morris with a Palladian influence , was ordered by Charles , Fifth Earl of Sutherland in the early 1730s . The French landscape architect André Le Nôtre was commissioned to lay out the park and grounds in the 1660s , and further alterations were made during the late 18th century under Henry Holland . Following the death of Diana , Princess of Wales in 1997 , she was interred on a small island in the middle of the ornamental Round Oval lake . A Doric @-@ style temple with Diana 's name inscribed on top , situated across from the lake , is a tourist attraction during July and August when the house and estate are open to the public , although the exhibition centre , situated in the old stable block , closed permanently in 2013 . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 A manor existed at Althorp in medieval times . It was referred to in the Domesday Book as " <unk> " , meaning Olla 's Thorp , believed to refer to a medieval lord named Olla . Thorp is a word of Scandinavian origin , which would have been pronounced as " <unk> " or " <unk> " , and in Danish probably meant " daughter 's settlement " . In the 13th and 15th centuries it was recorded as " <unk> " and " <unk> " , although when the estate was bought by John Spencer in 1508 it began being referred to as " <unk> " . 
 The name today is properly pronounced as " <unk> " , which is not officially recognised on paper and by the media . The current owner , Charles Spencer , noted that none of his family refer to it as Althorp , and that his father insisted on pronouncing it " Awl @-@ <unk> " . When he assumed ownership in 1992 , the BBC Pronunciation Department contacted him and the current " Althorp " was agreed upon .

 A hamlet named Althorp existed here in medieval times , believed to have been situated on the southwest side of the park , east of West Lodge . It was first mentioned in the Domesday Book as having a population of ten at the time , and being part of the parish of Brington . It was officially designated as an " extra parochial district " for centuries under the New Bottle Grove Hundred of Brington , but by 1874 it was being cited as an independent civil parish . 21 residents were documented in 1327 , and in 1377 fifty people were reported to have paid Poll Tax over the age of 14 . During the 15th century the population of the village diminished , and in 1505 there were no longer any tenants living there . By 1577 most of the land was converted into four substantial sheep pastures . 
 In 1469 John Spencer 's uncle – also named John Spencer – had become feoffee ( feudal lord ) of Wormleighton in Warwickshire and a tenant at Althorp in Northamptonshire in 1486 . The family 's administration of their Northamptonshire and Warwickshire estates gained them admiration and a following throughout England , and their sheep @-@ rearing business earned large profits . After beginning construction of Wormleighton Manor the previous year with some 60 relatives , John Spencer bought Althorp in 1508 for £ 800 from the Catesby family . At the time Spencer was also lord of the manors of Fenny Compton , <unk> , <unk> , Great Brington , Little Brington , <unk> , <unk> , Flore , Wicken , Wyke Hamon , Upper Boddington , Lower Boddington and Hinton , and owned numerous other properties . The park took some four years to establish , with 300 acres of grassland , 100 acres of woodland and 40 acres of water . 
 When John Spencer died in 1522 , he passed the estate to his youngest son , Sir William Spencer , High Sheriff of Northamptonshire , who held it until his death in 1532 . Only a boy at the time of William 's death , his son John Spencer inherited Althorp and held it until his death in 1586 , when he passed it to his son , also John , who died in 1600 . John 's son , Robert , was created the 1st Baron Spencer of Wormleighton on 21 July 1603 . King Charles I is documented to have visited Althorp during his reign . The drawing room was built and the main hall enlarged for the occasion , with £ 1 @,@ 300 spent on the banquet , an exorbitant sum for the period . Upon Robert Spencer 's death in 1627 Althorp devolved to William Spencer , 2nd Baron Spencer of Wormleighton who held it until his death in 1636 . William 's eldest son , Henry Spencer , 1st Earl of Sunderland , known as The Lord Spencer between 1636 and June 1643 , fought in the Battle of Edgehill in 1642 and was rewarded for his services on 8 June 1643 when the title of Earl of Sunderland was bestowed upon him , although the title cost him £ 3 @,@ 000 . He then fought in the Siege of Gloucester in August 1643 and the First Battle of Newbury on 20 September 1643 , where he was killed , aged 23 , by a cannonball . 
 Following Henry 's death , the estate passed to his eldest son Robert Spencer , 2nd Earl of Sunderland , just two years of age at the time . Cosimo III visited Althorp in 1669 , documenting it in his Travels of Cosmo III . Grand Duke of Tuscany , through England , in 1669 . Robert built the current house in 1688 and made a series of changes to Althorp park . However , Robert 's bad temper and his reputation as a ruthless advocate of absolute monarchy made him numerous enemies , and he was forced to leave the country and flee to the Netherlands the same year . He later underwent a political rehabilitation , becoming Lord Chamberlain of the Household in April 1697 and Lord Justice for a short period before retiring from public life in December of that year , after which he lived a secluded life at Althorp until his death in 1702 . Robert passed Althorp to his son , Charles Spencer , 3rd Earl of Sunderland , who held it for twenty years . Described by John Evelyn as " a youth of extraordinary hopes , " Charles inherited his father 's passion for intrigue and repellent manners , and from his early years he had a great love of books , spending his leisure and his wealth in expanding the library at Althorp . Charles 's second marriage to Anne Churchill , daughter of John Churchill , 1st Duke of Marlborough and Sarah Churchill , Duchess of Marlborough in 1700 was an important alliance for the Spencers and for his descendants ; through it he was introduced to political life , and later the dukedom of Marlborough came to the Spencers . In 1722 he was implicated in what became known as the Atterbury Plot , to restore the House of Stuart , and his death was one of the factors which brought the Plot to light . Althorp was then occupied by his son Robert Spencer , 4th Earl of Sunderland , who died childless in 1729 . As a result , his brother , Charles , became 5th Earl of Sunderland , and subsequently 3rd Duke of Marlborough after the death of his aunt , Henrietta Godolphin ( née Churchill ) , 2nd Duchess of Marlborough . Charles later led the naval descent on the French coastal port of St Malo during the Seven Years ' War , after passing Althorp to the 3rd Earl 's son , John Spencer , in January 1733 . John Spencer , along with Charles and Thomas Coram , William Hogarth and others , was involved in the charter of the Foundling Hospital . Upon his death in 1746 , John passed his estates to his son John , only 12 years of age at the time , beneficiary to the greatest inheritance in the kingdom at the time with an income of almost £ 30 @,@ 000 a year .

 John served as Member of Parliament for Warwick from 1756 to 1761 . He was renowned for his heavy spending on his political pursuits and campaigns , " indulging in the fiercely competitive and <unk> expensive business of fighting elections to Parliament – which effectively meant bribing people to vote for his candidate rather than that of another magnate " . He spent £ 120 @,@ 000 in one campaign alone and spent heavily on his estates , building Spencer House in London . He also wore expensive fashionable attire such as " diamond @-@ buckled shoes " . Althorp frequently hosted parties attended by the political and cultural elite , and it became known as a place of indulgence and festivities . At dinners and picnics in the gardens , John hired musicians to play French horns and organised unusual spectacles to entertain guests , such as a " Hooray Henry Olympics " , as Charles Spencer calls it , with a donkey race for Lord <unk> , dance competitions offering a guinea as the first prize , and sack races with the first prize of 30 shillings . The Christmas of 1755 was a grand affair . John celebrated his 21st birthday with a ball at the house on 20 December during which he secretly married 18 @-@ year @-@ old Margaret Georgiana Poyntz ; the couple did not inform anyone for several days . Around 5 @,@ 000 guests were invited to a celebration party organised by the Spencers in a shed on the village green in the nearby village of Brington , consuming some 11 @,@ 000 pints of beer . Althorp was " buzzing with activity " , and France 's top chefs were brought to Althorp to cater for the family and their guests during the week . He was created Baron Spencer of Althorp and Viscount Spencer by George III on 3 April 1761 , and on 1 November 1765 , he was given the title Viscount Althorp and made the first Earl Spencer . He was also High Steward of St Albans in 1772 and Mayor of St Albans in 1779 . John 's daughter , Georgiana Cavendish , Duchess of Devonshire , was also known for her liberal spending , and although she became one of Britain 's most prominent socialites in the late 18th century , with many political and literary connections , she suffered from a gambling addiction and had an eating disorder . 
 John 's son George John , 2nd Earl Spencer inherited Althorp after his father 's death in 1783 . He served as Whig MP for Northampton from 1780 to 1782 and for Surrey from 1782 to 1783 before accepting the title of 2nd Earl Spencer . He was later Home Secretary from 1806 to 1807 under Lord Grenville in the Ministry of All the Talents . Extremely interested in literary pursuits , he developed one of the largest private libraries in Europe at Althorp . He was the instigator and first President of the Roxburghe Club ( an exclusive bibliophilic club ) , founded in 1812 , President of the Royal Institution from 1813 to 1827 , and Commissioner of the Public Records in 1831 , among other literary pursuits . In later life , his collecting habit had become an obsession , and he attempted to collect every volume ever published in Britain . Such was his desire to obtain as complete a collection as possible , that when Napoleon instigated the secularisation of religious houses in south Germany , Spencer used the local British agent and Benedictine monk , Alexander Horn to acquire many of their rare books and manuscripts . Althorp became a major cultural hub of England during his time ; at one Christmas , the actor David Garrick , the historian Edward Gibbon , the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan and the painter Joshua Reynolds , among other artistic <unk> attended a party there together . However , George John 's spending became problematic for the Spencers , especially as at the time they were feeling the impact of the agricultural depressions brought on by the Napoleonic Wars . By the time of his death in 1834 he had amassed a debt of £ 500 @,@ 000 , which he passed onto his son , John Spencer , 3rd Earl Spencer . 
 The 3rd Earl became an active statesman , serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne from 1830 to 1834 . Along with Lord John Russell , he led the fight to pass the Reform Bill of 1832 , making more than twenty speeches , and is generally considered the architect of its victory . Despite his debts , in respect for his father , John managed to retain the massive book collection , and also continue to run the other Spencer houses at Wimbledon and Spencer House in London , as well as his farm in <unk> and shooting retreat in Norfolk . He achieved this mainly by far less extravagant living , spending much of the year at <unk> where the running costs were £ 1 @,@ 200 compared with the £ 5 @,@ 000 needed to run Althorp and pay the staff of 40 in the house . As a result , Althorp was largely abandoned during the late 1830s and early 1840s . John also leased out his lands and gardens and sold land in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire , repaying all the debt by the time of his death in 1845 , and beginning to run his properties at a profit . His son Frederick Spencer , 4th Earl Spencer , who owned Althorp from 1845 until his death in 1857 , also retained the collection . 
 John Spencer , 5th Earl Spencer , known as the Red Earl , inherited Althorp in 1857 . He served as a Liberal Party politician and was a close friend of British prime minister William Gladstone , who he served under in all four of his cabinets . Although politically successful , John fell into hard times financially and was forced to eventually sell much of the enormous library collection in 1892 to Enriqueta Rylands , who was building the University of Manchester Library . After dying childless in 1910 , John passed Althorp to his half brother , Charles Spencer , 6th Earl Spencer , who served as Lord Chamberlain from 1905 to 1912 in the Liberal administrations headed by Sir Henry Campbell @-@ Bannerman and H. H. Asquith .

 Times became more difficult for the Spencers by the late 19th century , and many of their assets had to be sold off . Albert Spencer , 7th Earl Spencer inherited the estate after his father Charles ' death in 1922 . Albert became a well @-@ known art connoisseur and was a trustee of the Wallace Collection , chairman of the Royal School of Needlework , a Fellow of both the Society of Antiquaries of London and the Royal Society of Arts , and from 1961 until 1969 he was Chair of the Advisory Council of the Victoria and Albert Museum . Despite his keen interest in art , he began selling off paintings and other items to pay off debts . In the 1930s he was forced to sell off a small but immaculate Hans Holbein portrait of Henry VIII ( now at the Thyssen @-@ Bornemisza Museum , Madrid ) for £ 10 @,@ 000 to finance his son 's education . Although a large sum at the time , by 1998 it was reputed to be worth around £ 50 million . Unlike many country houses in Britain during the Second World War which were occupied by the military and converted into hospitals , training camps and barracks , Althorp house remained untouched , thanks to Albert who saw to it that they used the stables instead . A Wellington bomber crashed near the ice house during the war , killing all of its crew . Due to Spencer House being in a dangerous location in London during the Blitz , many of the pieces of furniture and items of the house were brought to Althorp for safekeeping , including numerous fireplaces and doors with curled " S " doorknobs , a signature of the Spencer family dating to the 18th century . 
 The estate was first opened to the public in 1953 by Albert , to mitigate against taxation , and Althorp had its own railway station called Althorp Park on the Northampton Loop Line until 1960 . After his death in 1975 , Albert passed Althorp to his son Edward John , 8th Earl Spencer , who had served as Equerry to King George VI ( 1950 – 52 ) and to Queen Elizabeth II ( 1952 – 54 ) . Edward was a wine connoisseur and had an extensive wine cellar at Althorp . He made his own wine and attracted fellow connoisseurs from around the world to Althorp , although he did not sell much of it . During Edward 's ownership of Althorp approximately 20 % of the furnishings of Althorp were sold off . The divestment included eleven Van Dykes and nearly every religious painting in the collection , as well as estate housing , and drew severe public criticism , including from the heir . 
 Edward left the estate to his son , the current owner Charles Spencer , 9th Earl Spencer , after his death in 1992 . As a teenager , Charles served as a tour guide at the house and acquired a deep knowledge of Althorp . At the time he inherited the estate it was losing some £ 400 @,@ 000 annually , and the staff of 14 had to be significantly reduced . Charles ' older sister was Diana , Princess of Wales , who grew up with him at Althorp . 
 Since the 1990s Charles Spencer has done much to increase the revenue earned by the estate to keep it running . The annual Althorp Literary Festival was founded in 2003 . The heir apparent is Charles ' son Louis Frederick John Spencer ( born 1994 ) . Charles has expressed concerns about the future of the estate and whether Louis might be forced to sell it . In 2005 Charles endorsed a furniture collection of replicas from the house , known as the Althorp Living History Collection . 
 In 2009 a major restoration of the roof , stonework and the mathematical tiles that clad the building was undertaken . Approximately £ 10 million was spent on repairing the roof alone . In 2010 an auction of over 700 items from Althorp 's attics and cellars , as well as a Rubens and other notable works , achieved £ 21 million . 
 = = Architecture and collections = = 
 Althorp house is described as standing in a low situation , " approached by a handsome avenue , beautifully shaded with trees " . The house was originally a " classically beautiful " red brick Tudor building , and a Johannes <unk> painting dated to 1677 shows a smaller red house at Althorp and Holdenby House in the distance to the far right . Cosmo III noted that the interior of Althorp house was strongly influenced by Italian architecture , and remarked that it " may be said to be the best planned , and best arranged country seat in the kingdom ; for though there may be many which surpass it in size , none are superior to it in symmetrical elegance " . The current building dates to 1688 . Diarist John Evelyn described it that year : " The house , or rather palace , at Althorpe is a noble uniform pile in form of a half H , built of brick and freestone ' a la moderne ' ; the hall is well , the staircase excellent ; the rooms of state , galleries , offices , and furniture , such as may become a great prince . It is situate in the midst of a garden , exquisitely planned and kept and all this in a park walled in with hewn stone , planted with rows and walks of trees , canals and fishponds and stored with game . " Its appearance was radically altered in the 18th century when the architect Henry Holland was commissioned to make extensive changes starting in 1788 . Mathematical tiles were added to the exterior , brought from Ipswich , encasing the old red brick , and four Corinthian pilasters , made from Roche Abbey stone in Yorkshire , were added to the front . The stone used to make the pilasters was reportedly intended by Christopher Wren to be used in the construction of St Paul 's Cathedral . Sash windows with glazing bars and " moulded stone heads and surrounds " were added .

 The interior of the house is generally considered its strongest asset as the Spencer family has assembled an impressive collection of portrait art , including several pieces painted by the Flemish master Anthony van Dyck , and countless valuable pieces of porcelain and furniture . One of the rooms in the estate is called the Queen Mary bedroom , which was used by Queen Mary and George V during their visit to the estate in 1913 . Some £ 2 million was spent on redecorating the house in the 1980s by Raine , Countess Spencer , in a style described by Charles Spencer as having ' the wedding cake vulgarity of a five @-@ star hotel in Monaco ' . This work has been reversed , and the interior returned to its original grand but understated appearance .

 = = = = = Wootton Hall and Saloon = = = = = 
 Wootton Hall is the grand hall entrance on the central south side of Althorp house . " Perfectly proportioned " with a two @-@ storey high ceiling , it was cited by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as " the noblest Georgian room in the county " . It takes its name from the painter John Wootton who was commissioned by the family in 1733 to paint a number of massive paintings in his Marylebone studio to reflect the family 's love of equestrian pursuits , particularly fox hunting . At the time , Wootton was considered to be the finest painter of horses in the country . The paintings still hang on the walls . The hall has a substantial collection of artefacts collected over the years . Aside from the hall porter 's chair , there is a dozen or so lavish @-@ looking hall chairs , one of which is a sedan chair , rediscovered in the Stable Block in 1911 , which had once been in Spencer House . 
 A prominent feature of the Wootton Hall is its pair of Italian black and <unk> marble <unk> <unk> , originally given to the First Duke of Marlborough as a present from General Charles Churchill . In exceptionally good condition , they stand either side of the door into the Saloon . These were discovered in the silt of the River Tiber and are depictions of slaves who once served in a Roman household . Several flags stand above them , including the White Ensign . The ceiling is intricately made , featuring flowers in the plaster , each one different , the work of Colen Campbell in the early 18th century . The black and white check marble floor is also a distinguishing feature of the room , but through most of its history this floor would have been left plain as horses and carriages would enter the hall inside . In the mid 19th century Frederick , the 4th Earl , had laid down brown and blue tiles , replaced by the marble floor which was added by his son Robert in around 1910 . The floor gives significant depth to the hall and provides fine acoustics , so much that Diana would once practice her tap dancing in the hall as a teenager . 
 Beyond the Wootton Hall is the Saloon , which was converted from an inner courtyard and roofed in 1650 by Dorothy Spencer , Countess of Sunderland . The Saloon was the first room at Althorp to have electricity installed , and it contains an imposing oak staircase , added in the 1660s . Cosmo III noted Althorp 's " spacious staircase of the wood of the walnut tree , stained , constructed with great magnificence ; this staircase , dividing itself into two equal branches , leads to the grand saloon , from which is the passage into the chambers , all of them regularly disposed after the Italian manner , to which country the Earl was indented for a model of the design . " Historically , the staircase was painted white . It is described as being " surprisingly shallow and delightfully uneven – a physical manifestation of the long history of the house " .

 The South Drawing Room is at the front of the house on the West Wing . In earlier times the room had served as a dining room , despite it being about as far from the kitchen as possible . This section of the house was largely remodelled under Henry Holland , but it retains its Georgian elegance today , " gilded to within an inch of its life " , with walls painted in a duck egg blue colour with forest green drapery and peach @-@ patterned sofas . A large mirror with an exquisite gold frame stands between the two windows . The fireplace was added by the Chelsea stonemason Lancelot Edward Wood in 1802 , and the ceiling by master builder Benjamin Broadbent of Leicester in 1865 . The ceiling in the Yellow Drawing Room , also known as the Rubens Room because of its four Rubens paintings , is also attributed to Broadbent . There are numerous paintings on the walls , including fifteen Joshua Reynolds portraits and a miniature portrait in one of the alcoves of Admiral Lord Nelson , an associate of George John , Second Earl Spencer . Although <unk> , the night watchman , guarded the place from 8 pm to 8 am , in 1954 one of the lesser valuable paintings in the South Drawing Room was stolen in the night . 
 The Grandmother 's Sitting Room is situated at the front of the eastern wing . It is noted for its deep blue hand @-@ painted frescoes and formal furniture , and was the favourite room of Charles and Diana 's grandmother , Cynthia Spencer , Countess Spencer . Nearby was the Muniment Room in which the Spencer family records were kept , described as a " musty apartment " which contained over 500 years of history , from medieval household accounts to letters from <unk> and accounts of Victorian house parties . The room was a favourite haunt of Spencer 's grandfather , Albert Spencer , who would spend thousands of hours in it perusing over the family history . So guarded was he of the collection that when Winston Churchill once spent time in the room looking for information on his ancestor , John Churchill , 1st Duke of Marlborough ( 1650 – 1722 ) , Albert immediately doused out his cigar in fear of creating a fire . The records were sold to the British Library in the 1980s , leaving the room empty , before it was converted to what is known as the " Steward 's Room Flat " . This part of the house once had an extensive collection of 1830s bull paintings by Richard <unk> . 
 The Sutherland Room lies at the rear east wing of the house and was once the bedroom of the Earl of Althorp in the first few centuries of the house when it was fashionable for the occupants to sleep on the ground floor and guests to sleep on the first floor . This was still the case during the Holland restoration , and as a result the room was ignored , so it retains many of the earlier mouldings not seen in many other parts of the house . It contains two fireplaces made by John Vardy and James Stuart which were originally situated in Spencer House , and the room has the original 17th @-@ century cornice . The paintings in the room were selected by the current owner Charles Spencer to honour John , Third Earl Spencer and his passion for foxhunting . After it ceased usage as a bedroom , on special occasions the room would be full of life ; on Christmas Day the room would be " transformed into a Christmas fairyland , with clockwork Santas , snowmen and angels all spinning and chiming in the candlelight " . The children would have their places marked by a small cake with their names written on it in icing . 
 The Marlborough Room , which contains the Great Parlour , is named after Sarah Churchill , Duchess of Marlborough , and is situated next to the Sunderland Room and at left angles to the Library . The Marlborough Room served as an " uncomfortable " drawing room until the 1990s when a Victorian rosewood dining table accommodating for up to 42 people was added , with ' squiggle @-@ back ' chairs attributed to George Seddon in 1800 . The new room was created after alterations were made to the large drawing room by the 6th Earl Spencer in 1911 , including the removal of a dividing partition from the old billiard room . Part of the restoration work attributed to the 7th Earl Spencer after 1957 includes a replacement of two Victorian chimney pieces in the Marlborough Room with those from Spencer House , one which was crafted by Peter Scheemakers . Portraits by Thomas Gainsborough , Joshua Reynolds , and George Romney , mostly of family members , adorn the walls , and accessions from the Spencer House are placed throughout . 
 = = = = = Dining rooms = = = = = 
 The Great Dining Room is situated in the east wing extension of the house and was added in 1877 under J. MacVicar Anderson during the time of the Red Earl . The room was inspired by the ballroom of Buckingham Palace , with walls hung with faded , red damask silk . The Spencers ate their regular meals in the Tapestry Dining Room , an inner room of the east side to the east of the Wooton Hall . Aside from the two fine vividly constructed tapestries , one of gypsies and one of farming , the room is fairly bleak in design compared to other rooms in the house ; the dining table is relatively small , with a drab grey floor and open brick fireplace dated in large letters to 1683 . The " sombre " oak panelling originally came from the family 's other property of Wormleighton Manor in Warwickshire . Charles Spencer recalled that three generations of Spencers would eat their lunch together and that dining conditions were " silent , apart from the noises of my grandfather eating with great gusto , a napkin tucked in around his neck , hanging down over his popping @-@ out tummy , and it was all very sad and tense " .
