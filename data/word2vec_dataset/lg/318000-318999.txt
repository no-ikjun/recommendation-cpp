 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa near Dakar on August 31 . It moved westward into the Intertropical Convergence Zone , and organized into a tropical disturbance on September 2 with a small , circular area of convection . The system moved to the west , and on September 3 , the convection diminished after moving west of 40 ° W. By the next day , the tropical disturbance was barely discernible from the clouds of the Intertropical Convergence Zone . The wave gradually became detached from the ITCZ , and based on a reconnaissance flight that confirmed the existence of a low @-@ level circulation , it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on September 5 while located 255 miles ( 415 km ) east of Grenada . 
 The depression moved westward quickly , and moved through the southern Lesser Antilles early on September 6 . The southern portion of the circulation passed over northeastern Venezuela , though after entering the Caribbean Sea , another reconnaissance flight was unable to confirm the existence of a low @-@ level circulation . Shortly thereafter , while moving into an area of light wind shear , it was able to organize and strengthen further , and on September 7 the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Edith near the island of Curaçao . While initially , a cold @-@ core upper @-@ level low persisted about 750 miles ( 1200 km ) northwest of the storm , Edith moved west @-@ northwestward due to the influence of a narrow and persistent ridge of high pressure , which extended from the southwestern Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico . As the storm continued into open waters of the Caribbean , the upper @-@ level low gradually weakened and was replaced with an anticyclone . This allowed the storm to strengthen further , and on September 8 , Edith became a hurricane in the south @-@ central Caribbean Sea . 
 On September 9 , the storm rapidly intensified , and within 24 hours , Edith strengthened from a minimal hurricane to a powerful 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) Category 5 hurricane just off the coast of Nicaragua . The cause for the explosive deepening is unknown , though it is speculated that the transformation in the upper troposphere from an upper @-@ level low to an anticyclone led to a release of baroclinic energy . Reconnaissance aircraft crews in the peak of the storm reported extreme turbulence , causing concern for the safety of the crews . At its peak intensity , the very well @-@ defined " pinhole " eye was only 5 miles ( 8 km ) in diameter . Late on September 9 , Hurricane Edith made landfall on northeastern Nicaragua at Cabo Gracias a Dios . 
 Hurricane Edith rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of northeastern Central America , and 18 hours after it made landfall , it emerged into the Gulf of Honduras as an 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) Category 1 hurricane . It continued to weaken as it moved northwestward , and made landfall near Belize City with tropical storm winds of 70 mph ( 115 km / h ) . Edith weakened further while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula , and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico near Campeche , Mexico late on September 11 as a minimal tropical storm . Edith initially failed to re @-@ intensify as it moved northwestward , despite low amounts of wind shear and warm waters . This was because an anticyclone over the Gulf was closely connected with Hurricane Fern , which developed and moved over the northwestern portion of the Gulf of Mexico . The anticyclone resulted in an easterly upper @-@ level flow across Edith , creating conditions not conducive for intensification . As Fern moved inland over Texas , the flow became more favorable around Edith , and 36 hours after entering the Gulf of Mexico , the storm began to reintensify slightly . 
 Edith continued moving to the west @-@ northwest , heading towards the coast of Mexico , but early on September 14 , the storm stalled while located just off the coast of Tamaulipas . A mid @-@ latitude trough of low pressure approached the storm , and caused Edith to turn to slowly drift towards the northeast . Located only miles from the Mexican coast , Edith again failed to strengthen until September 15 , when it accelerated northeastward and regained hurricane status . The hurricane turned to the east @-@ northeast as it approached the coast of Louisiana , and made landfall on September 16 in a sparsely populated area 30 miles ( 48 km ) east of Cameron with winds of 105 mph ( 170 km / h ) , equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane in the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . Edith rapidly weakened over land , degenerating into a tropical storm over Louisiana , and into a tropical depression over Mississippi . It continued to the east @-@ northeast , and dissipated over northwestern Georgia on September 18 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Fourteen hours prior to Edith making landfall in Central America , the National Hurricane Center warned citizens about the extreme danger of the approaching hurricane , and asked them to prepare for hurricane conditions . While the storm was located in the Gulf of Mexico , the National Hurricane Center issued a Hurricane Warning from Cameron to Morgan City , Louisiana eighteen hours before the hurricane made landfall . Edith later struck land in the middle portion of the warning area . 
 In Belize , officials ordered the mandatory evacuation of low @-@ lying areas , resulting in hundreds of residents leaving to the United States through the international airport . Officials sent police troops to maintain order and prevent looting . 
 In the Gulf of Mexico , several oil facilities were closed or placed on automatic controls . Drilling rigs as far east as the coastal waters off of Mississippi were prepared to evacuate in the event Edith moved further east than anticipated . Additionally , thousands evacuated coastal areas of Louisiana prior to the arrival of the hurricane . Several shelters opened in coastal cities , and many people prepared for the hurricane by purchasing emergency supplies . Officials closed schools throughout much of southern Louisiana .

 While passing through the southern Lesser Antilles , the tropical depression produced heavy rainfall and winds of around 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . Edith produced tropical storm force winds in Aruba , and gusts reached 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . Two fishermen were reported lost at sea and presumed dead as a result of Edith . 
 Edith produced strong winds across northeastern Nicaragua and eastern Honduras , with Puerto Lempira reporting an unofficial sustained wind of 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) . Press reports indicated every house in the Cape Gracias area was destroyed or heavily damaged , leaving 7 @,@ 000 homeless . The meteorological service in British Honduras stated there were 100 fatalities near Cape Gracias , though a later report indicated 35 people died in Nicaragua . There , damage was estimated at over US $ 380 @,@ 000 ( 1971 dollars , $ 2 @.@ 22 million in 2016 dollars ) . Three United States Air Force aircraft delivered food , medical supplies , and fuel to the hurricane victims of Nicaragua . In Honduras , the hurricane produced 15 foot ( 4 @.@ 5 m ) tides and strong winds , while strong waves destroyed 40 fishing boats as well . While the hurricane reportedly destroyed entire villages , no deaths occurred in Honduras . 
 Offshore islands in Belize reported winds of up to 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . Edith produced flooding in a few towns in the southern portion of the country , with some buildings damaged . Heavy damage was reported near Monkey River Town . Impact in Mexico , if any , is unknown . 
 = = = United States = = = 
 Two stations in Texas recorded sustained tropical force winds , and Galveston reported a peak wind gust of 53 mph ( 85 km / h ) . While moving past the state , Edith produced above normal tides of over 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) in locations , which flooded a portion of Highway 87 . The storm dropped light to moderate amounts of rainfall peaking at 3 @.@ 5 inches ( 89 mm ) in Sabine Pass . The passage of Hurricane Edith resulted in downed trees and power lines , and damage totaling US $ 180 @,@ 000 ( 1971 dollars , $ 900 @,@ 000 in 2006 dollars ) . 
 Off the coast of Louisiana , the hurricane wrecked three boats , but all the occupants were safely rescued . While making landfall in Louisiana , Edith resulted in above normal tides of up to 9 @.@ 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 9 m ) above normal at <unk> Point near Morgan City . The highest winds reported by a land station were 69 mph ( 111 km / h ) at Cameron , where a wind gust of 96 mph ( 155 km / h ) was also reported . However , due to the lack of recording instruments near the hurricane 's landing point , whether higher winds occurred there is not known , although likely . Rainfall was moderate across Louisiana , including amounts of over 8 inches ( 200 mm ) in the southwestern portion of the state . A strong rainband well ahead of the hurricane , combined with the intrusion of dry air into the hurricane 's circulation , produced 16 tornadoes from Louisiana to Alabama . An F3 tornado touched down in the eastern residential suburbs of Baton Rouge , causing heavy property damage totaling $ 2 @.@ 5 million ( 1971 dollars , $ 14 @.@ 6 million in 2016 dollars ) along its intermittent 7 mile ( 11 km ) path . The tornado also injured three people . An F2 tornado in Tangipahoa Parish caused $ 250 @,@ 000 in damage ( 1971 dollars , $ 1 @.@ 46 million in 2016 dollars ) along its 4 mile ( 6 km ) path , while an F1 tornado in St. Martin Parish injured 6 people on its 3 mile ( 5 km ) path . The hurricane caused extensive damage to the sugar cane crop in southwestern Louisiana . About a month after Edith struck the United States , President Richard Nixon declared portions of Louisiana as a disaster area , which allocated relief funds to aid the affected citizens . 
 In Mississippi , wind gusts peaked at 70 mph ( 112 km / h ) in Hattiesburg , with multiple locations reporting tropical @-@ storm @-@ force winds . Additionally , Edith produced moderate rainfall peaking at 6 @.@ 15 inches ( 156 mm ) in Liberty . In Alabama , the storm caused light rains , moderate wind gusts , and a storm tide of 2 @.@ 7 feet ( 0 @.@ 8 m ) in Mobile . Edith spawned four tornadoes in Alabama , three of which were F2 tornadoes . Two touched down in Baldwin County ; one destroyed two homes and damaged several others , and the other destroyed two mobile homes , a few barns , and damaged ten houses . Two tornadoes also touched down in Washington County , one of which destroyed several small buildings and downed a few trees . In Florida , Edith produced slightly above @-@ normal tides and light rain . It spawned a tornado in Pensacola , Florida , injuring one person and inflicting $ 25 @,@ 000 in damage ( 1971 dollars , $ 125 @,@ 000 in 2006 dollars ) . Damage throughout the United States totaled $ 25 million ( 1971 dollars , $ 146 million in 2016 dollars ) , primarily from crop damage in southwest Louisiana . No deaths were reported in the United States . 
 = 1998 – 99 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season = 
 The 1998 – 99 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season was a quiet season that had the fourth @-@ lowest number of days with tropical storm or tropical cyclone activity . Most of the storms formed either in the Mozambique Channel or in the far eastern portion of the basin , with five storms crossing from the adjacent Australian basin east of 90 ° E. As a result , few storms impacted Madagascar , and none made landfall on the African continent . Throughout most of the season , there was below @-@ normal sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar . In February , typically the peak in activity , Réunion island recorded its highest average monthly pressure since 1953 . Due to generally unfavorable conditions , there were only six tropical storms tracked by the Météo @-@ France office ( MFR ) on Réunion . There were only two tropical cyclones – a storm with winds of at least 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . 
 Activity began late , with the first tropical storm – Alda – forming on January 16 , the third latest ever recorded at the time . Alda formed in the Mozambique Channel , which was one of few favorable areas for tropical cyclogenesis in the season . It brought rainfall to southwestern Madagascar that alleviated previously dry conditions . The next five tropical storms either originated or crossed into the adjacent Australian basin , where storms were monitored by the Bureau of Meteorology ( BoM ) . Both Tropical Storm Chikita and Tropical Cyclone Davina brought beneficial rainfall to the Mascarene Islands . The latter storm caused two drowning deaths on Réunion and caused some crop damage . The strongest storm – Evrina – peaked as a strong cyclone in the Australian but weakened upon crossing 90 ° E , with 10 @-@ minute maximum sustained winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) in the basin . The final storm was unnamed , crossing from the Australian basin on April 21 as a minimal tropical storm before quickly dissipating . There were also several tropical disturbances or depressions , many short @-@ lived . The first of these formed on September 3 in the northeastern portion of the basin , and there was a tropical depression in February in the Mozambique Channel that approached tropical storm status . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 The Météo @-@ France office ( MFR ) on Réunion island issued warnings in tropical cyclones within the basin during the season . The agency estimated intensity through the Dvorak technique , and warned on tropical cyclones in the region from the coast of Africa to 90 ° E , south of the equator . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center – a joint United States Navy – United States Air Force task force – also issued tropical cyclone warnings for the region . Wind estimates from Météo @-@ France and most other basins throughout the world are sustained over 10 minutes , while estimates from the United States @-@ based Joint Typhoon Warning Center are sustained over 1 minute . 10 minute winds are about 1 @.@ 14 times the amount of 1 minute winds . Most storms formed and dissipated within the tropics , with the exception of Severe Tropical Storm Alda . 
 During the season , atmospheric conditions shifted from El Niño to La Niña , but despite the shift , the season was similarly inactive as its predecessor . In general , sea surface temperatures were below normal , and atmospheric pressures were above normal , both unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis . In the month of February , on average the peak time for activity , there was a general lack of convection , or thunderstorms , east of Madagascar . The average monthly pressure on Réunion was the highest since reliable records began in 1953 . The low number of storms occurred despite an otherwise active cyclone year in the southern hemisphere . In its summary of the season , the MFR described the lack of activity as " rare and remarkable " , possibly related to a Walker circulation . The agency monitored 14 tropical disturbances , of which only eight were tropical depressions for at least 24 hours . Six of these intensified into tropical storms , three less than the average of nine , of which only two attained tropical cyclone status , or half the average . There were 28 days in which there was storm or tropical cyclone activity , less than the average of 42 and at the time the fourth lowest since reliable record @-@ keeping began in 1967 with the advent of satellite imagery . The only seasons with a lower number of storm days were 1982 – 83 , 1986 – 87 , and 1997 – 98 .

 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Alda = = = 
 After a subtropical depression exited the Mozambique Channel , another area of convection formed in the region on January 8 , which fluctuated in intensity for several days . A passing cold front increased convection further on January 12 , which split off a cutoff low @-@ pressure area . Two days later , a subtropical disturbance formed offshore Beira , Mozambique , classified due to the extratropical origins and lack of centralized convection . The system remained nearly stationary , with the convection extending well to the east . On January 16 , the MFR reclassified the system as a tropical depression after the thunderstorms increased near the center , the increasing organization due to moderate but decreasing wind shear . By that time , the depression had begun an eastward movement , but soon turned to the south in the weakness between two high @-@ pressure areas . Late on January 16 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alda after the convection organized into a central dense overcast . Also that day , the JTWC began tracking the system as Tropical Cyclone 12S . This marked an unusually late start for the first named storm , at the time the third @-@ latest on record . 
 Neither the MFR nor the JTWC anticipated much strengthening after Alda attained tropical storm status . Around the time of its upgrade , Alda passed about 20 km ( 12 mi ) west of Europa Island in the Mozambique Channel , where sustained winds reached 72 km / h ( 45 mph ) and gusts were as strong as 90 km / h ( 56 mph ) . A building ridge southeast of Madagascar turned the storm to the southwest . After an increase in wind shear diminished the convection , the JTWC discontinued advisories on January 17 , although the thunderstorms redeveloped following an unexpected decrease in wind shear . Alda turned to the southeast ahead of an approaching trough , and developed a ragged eye feature on January 18 . That day , the MFR estimated peak 10 @-@ minute winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) , and the JTWC estimated one @-@ minute winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) , equivalent to a minimal hurricane . The latter agency also reissued one advisory when the storm was at its peak . Alda accelerated to the southeast and gradually lost tropical characteristics , becoming extratropical on January 19 before being absorbed by the approaching cold front . 
 Following rainfall from an earlier subtropical depression , Alda dropped 198 mm ( 7 @.@ 8 in ) of rainfall in Morombe in southwestern Madagascar . The rainfall caused flooding that affected thousands of people . The rainfall was beneficial in alleviating previously dry conditions that had prevented crops to be planted . The passage of the storm also caused temperatures to decrease in Mozambique and Madagascar . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Damien @-@ Birenda = = = 
 On January 21 , a tropical disturbance formed in the Australian region about 500 kilometres ( 310 mi ) south of the Indonesian island of Java . Moving west @-@ southwestward , the system intensified into Tropical Storm Damien on January 23 , and attained tropical cyclone status two days later while passing 400 km ( 250 mi ) south of the Cocos Islands . Subsequently , an increase in wind shear induced steady weakening , causing the circulation to be briefly exposed from the convection on January 26 . Damien maintained an area of convection nearby the circulation , and exited into the south @-@ west Indian Ocean on January 28 as a minimal tropical storm ; at that time , the Mauritius Meteorological Services renamed the storm as Birenda . The storm turned more to the west and west @-@ northwest due to a building ridge to the south . Increasing wind shear weakened Birenda to tropical depression status on January 29 and into a tropical disturbance the next day . Although convection was intermittent , the circulation dissipated on February 3 . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm Chikita = = = 
 Soon after Damien @-@ Birenda exited the Australian region , another tropical disturbance formed north of the Cocos on January 29 , which was initially weak but gradually organized . The disturbance tracked quickly west @-@ westward due to a powerful ridge to the south , remaining in tandem with Tropical Storm Birenda about 1 @,@ 300 km ( 810 mi ) to the east . On January 31 , the system crossed into the south @-@ west Indian Ocean . The fast forward motion caused the effects of wind shear to diminish as well as increase the circulation 's strength , and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chikita on January 31 . At that time , the storm attained its peak intensity of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . Almost immediately thereafter , the convection began weakening due to lukewarm water temperatures , and Chikita weakened to tropical depression status on February 1 . Continuing rapidly to the west , the circulation became exposed from the convection on February 3 due to increased wind shear . Around that time , Chikita passed about 75 km ( 47 mi ) north of Rodrigues island , and shortly thereafter weakened into a tropical disturbance . On the next day , the circulation passed north of both Mauritius and Réunion , presenting an asymmetric structure with the strongest winds to the south . Chikita dissipated on February 5 off the southeast coast of Madagascar . 
 On Rodrigues , Chikita produced wind gusts of 92 km / h ( 57 mph ) and a rainfall total of 113 mm ( 4 @.@ 4 in ) , the rainfall proving beneficial due to previously dry conditions . Despite only being a tropical disturbance , Chikita produced wind gusts of 89 kilometres per hour ( 55 mph ) on Mauritius and 104 km / h ( 65 mph ) in the mountainous peaks of Réunion . The rainfall rates in both islands varied greatly ; the peak total on Mauritius was 160 mm ( 6 @.@ 3 in ) compared to the peak of 560 mm ( 22 in ) in Bébourg in the heights of Réunion . Also on the latter island , there was a six @-@ hour rainfall total of 132 mm ( 5 @.@ 2 in ) at Piton de la Fournaise . Wet weather persisted after Chikita dissipated , resulting in four @-@ day totals of 953 mm ( 37 @.@ 5 in ) in Bébourg on Réunion , and easing drought conditions on Mauritius . 
 = = = Intense Tropical Cyclone Davina = = = 
 After an extended period with no activity across much of the Indian Ocean , the intertropical convergence zone ( ITCZ ) rebuilt toward the end of February , and spawned an area of convection on March 1 in the extreme eastern portion of the basin . The next day , a circulation was noted on satellite imagery to the northeast of the convection , which indicated that a tropical disturbance had developed . The influence of the monsoon trough steered the disturbance to the southeast into the Australian basin , where moderate wind shear prevented quick development . A building ridge to the south turned the system to the southwest , bringing it back into the south @-@ west Indian on March 3 as a tropical depression . With decreasing wind shear , the depression slowly intensified as convection increased , becoming Tropical Storm Davina on March 4 . An eye developed the next day , signaling Davina had intensified into a tropical cyclone , or reaching 10 @-@ minute winds of at least 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . On March 7 , Davina became an intense tropical cyclone , with sustained 10 @-@ minute winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . At around the same time , the JTWC estimated peak 1 @-@ minute winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) . 
 Continuing quickly to the west @-@ southwest , Davina moved over an area of cooler waters and began weakening . On March 8 , the system passed about 140 km ( 87 mi ) northwest of Rodrigues as a minimal tropical cyclone . The next day , Davina re @-@ intensified slightly to winds of 130 km / h ( 85 mph ) , and while near that intensity its eyewall crossed over Mauritius . After passing the island , the eye increased to a diameter of 50 km ( 31 mi ) before deteriorating . On March 10 , Davina passed about 35 km ( 22 mi ) southeast of Réunion as a severe tropical storm . The next day , the storm slowed its forward motion and rapidly weakened due to increasing wind shear , becoming a tropical depression on March 12 . The circulation turned to the northeast and later to the west in the trade winds . Davina looped off the east coast of Madagascar , eventually dissipating on March 19 . 
 Cyclone Davina affected Rodrigues as a weakening storm , which limited wind gusts to 137 km / h ( 85 mph ) and rainfall to only 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) . After moving toward Mauritius for several days , the cyclone produced a peak wave height of 7 @.@ 73 m ( 25 @.@ 4 ft ) . On the island , the airport at Plaisance recorded a peak gust of 169 km / h ( 105 mph ) , strong enough to cause crop damage and injure 60 people . Rainfall peaked at 227 mm ( 8 @.@ 9 in ) , which failed to break the island 's worst drought since 1904 . On Réunion , wind gusts also peaked at 169 km / h ( 105 mph ) at Piton Sainte @-@ Rose . Davina produced wave heights of 8 @.@ 84 m ( 29 @.@ 0 ft ) at Saint @-@ Pierre . Rainfall on Réunion was highest in the southern portion of the island , mainly through the process of orographic lift ; over a three @-@ hour period , 180 mm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) of precipitation was recorded at Piton de la Fournaise , and the highest total was 1 @,@ 200 mm ( 47 in ) in the island 's center . Due to the storm 's slow movement , Davina produced scattered rainfall over Réunion for several days . Two people drowned in the Rivière des Galets , but otherwise the rainfall proved beneficial in alleviating dry conditions . The gusty winds damaged the sugar cane and banana crops , but overall damage was minor . 
 = = = Intense Tropical Cyclone Frederic – Evrina = = = 
 On March 25 , an area of convection formed along the monsoon trough in the Australian basin , gradually organizing into a tropical storm while moving west @-@ southwestward and given the name Frederic . On March 29 , the storm attained tropical cyclone status , and continued to strengthen due to warm waters . At its peak on March 31 , Frederic developed a well @-@ defined 40 km ( 25 mi ) eye within a circular central dense overcast . The MFR estimated peak 10 @-@ minute winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) , and the JTWC estimated maximum 1 @-@ minute winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) , equivalent to a Category 5 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane wind scale . Subsequently , Frederic encountered the combination of wind shear and cooler , dry air , which caused weakening . On April 1 , the cyclone crossed into the south @-@ west Indian Ocean with 10 @-@ minute winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) , at which time it was renamed Evrina . 
 Continuing to the west @-@ southwest upon entering the basin , Evrina gradually weakened as the eye gradually dissipated . It soon encountered the same cooler waters of the southern Indian that affected previous storms Chikita and Davina . By April 2 , Evrina had weakened below tropical cyclone status , just 30 hours after it was at peak intensity . Around that time , the circulation became exposed from the deepest convection , and the track shifted more to the west . On April 5 , Evrina weakened to tropical depression status . Two days later , the system turned toward the south , moving in a circular track around the island of Rodrigues while remaining far enough away not to cause any effects . On April 8 , the circulation turned to the east , dissipating two days later to the south of Rodrigues . 
 = = = Moderate Tropical Storm F1 ( Hamish ) = = = 
 On April 17 , an area of convection persisted near the border of the south @-@ west Indian and the Australian regions . The system moved eastward into the Australian basin , becoming a tropical disturbance on April 19 . Turning to the southeast , the system gradually organized as the convection persisted . On April 20 , the disturbance intensified into a tropical storm and was named Hamish . Shortly thereafter , the ridge to the south turned the storm to the southwest . After the BoM estimated peak winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) , Hamish began quickly weakening due to increasing wind shear . On April 21 , the storm crossed into the south @-@ west Indian basin , still maintaining 10 @-@ minute winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . Although the Mauritius Meteorological Services should have classified the system as Tropical Storm Francine , the storm remained unnamed , referred as Tropical Storm F1 . However , the system weakened to tropical depression status within six hours of entering the basin , and dissipating on April 24 .

 At the time , the MFR 's cyclone season began on August 1 , although the JTWC 's cyclone season for the southern hemisphere began on July 1 . The latter agency tracked a short @-@ lived tropical storm toward the end of July , classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 01S . The MFR named it Tropical Depression H4 , estimating peak 10 @-@ minute winds of 55 km / h ( 35 km / h ) . 
 The first system of the season proper originated out of an area of convection in early September in the northeast portion of the basin . On September 3 , the MFR initiated advisories on Tropical Disturbance A1 about 1435 km ( 890 mi ) east of Diego Garcia . The system tracked westward , and the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) on September 4 . Failing to intensify beyond winds of 45 km / h ( 30 mph ) , the disturbance dissipated on September 6 . Later in the month , Tropical Disturbance A2 formed in a similar region within the monsoon trough , with the MFR initiating advisories on September 29 . Also on that day , the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 02S . That day , the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm status , although strong wind shear prevented intensification . The MFR quickly discontinued advisories , but the JTWC continued tracking it , again upgrading the system to tropical storm status on October 1 . After the shear again increased , the storm weakened , dissipating on October 2 . 
 In November , rapidly weakening Tropical Cyclone Alison moved from the Australian basin and dissipated immediately upon entering the south @-@ west Indian Ocean on November 13 . On December 4 , short @-@ lived Tropical Disturbance A3 was classified by MFR , subsequently drifting into the Australian region . Possibly related to the previous system , Tropical Cyclone Cathy moved from the Australian basin into the basin on December 28 , quickly dissipating .

 On January 1 , an area of convection persisted in the Mozambique Channel , with an associated circulation located on land in Mozambique . The system drifted to the east and southeast over warmer waters , gradually organizing . On January 3 , the MFR classified the system as Tropical Disturbance A4 near the Mozambique coastline . The disturbance accelerated to the southeast , passing southwest of Madagascar with an asymmetric structure ; most of the convection was on the eastern periphery due to strong wind shear . Heavy rainfall occurred along the southwest Madagascar coast , peaking at 322 mm ( 12 @.@ 7 in ) over a 48 ‑ hour period in Morombe . Wind gusts there reached 180 km / h ( 110 mph ) , although the disturbance 's maximum sustained 10 @-@ minute winds were 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) . The disturbance transitioned into a subtropical depression on January 5 , but soon after became extratropical while accelerating southeastward . 
 During an extended period of quiet conditions across much of the basin , an area of low pressure persisted along the eastern coast of Mozambique . Convection fluctuated daily but became more persistent on February 11 . That day , the thunderstorms organized into a circulation that had formed less than 200 km ( 120 mi ) southeast of Beira , Mozambique , becoming Tropical Disturbance D1 . After forming , the system moved southward , developing a central dense overcast with northeasterly outflow . Based on the organization , the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression on February 13 . Although there were gale force winds in the southwest periphery , the circulation was located on the northern edge of the convection . The depression neared tropical storm intensity , but an increase in wind shear from a nearby trough prevented further intensification . The JTWC estimated peak 1 @-@ minute winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) , making the system a tropical storm by their assessment . A building ridge to the south turned the depression to the northeast , bringing the system near Europa Island . A station on the island recorded sustained winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) with gusts to 104 km / h ( 65 mph ) about three hours before and after the closest approach ; the observations suggested that the depression could have become a tropical storm . Soon thereafter , the associated convection dissipated and the circulation turned westward . After crossing over its former path , the depression dissipated on February 17 very close to where it developed . 
 Similar to the previous depression and Tropical Storm Alda , Tropical Disturbance D2 developed in the Mozambique Channel , initially subtropical in nature . On February 20 , a cold front exited the African coast off Mozambique , spawning an area of convection . A weak low pressure area developed on February 23 , which proceeded to move southeastward . Due to unfavorable wind shear , the system failed to organize much , although initially it produced strong wind gusts . On February 28 , much of the convection was removed from the circulation , which looped over southwestern Madagascar to turn back to the west . On March 4 , when Tropical Storm Davina was named , the disturbance was renamed E1 . The next day , the circulation executed a small loop , dissipating on March 6 over eastern Mozambique . 
 A long @-@ lived system developed on February 28 in the Australian region south of February 28 , and moved westward . On March 7 , the JTWC initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 26S , briefly estimating peak 1 @-@ minute winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) the next day . Soon after , the system weakened into a tropical depression , crossing into the south @-@ west Indian Ocean late on March 8 . At that time , it was designated Tropical Disturbance E2 . Continuing westward along the northern edge of a strong ridge , the disturbance failed to intensify due to easterly wind shear . Although the MFR ceased issuing advisories , they noted that a distinct circulation persisted , reaching a location to the north of Mauritius by March 16 . That day , it turned back to the east with a sporadic area of convection , influenced by the larger Tropical Depression E3 . Two days later , the system organized enough for the MFR to reclassify it as a tropical disturbance . The system failed to reorganize much , and dissipated on March 20 . Another tropical disturbance , named E3 , formed on March 11 in the eastern portion of the basin . It initially failed to develop more , but after an increase in convection , the system intensified into a tropical depression on March 14 while moving generally west @-@ northwestward . On the next day , the system began drifting to the southwest due to weak steering currents . On March 16 , the JTWC initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 28S , briefly upgrading it to tropical storm status on the next day . On March 18 , the depression began weakening , dissipating three days later .

 = Japanese ironclad Fusō = 
 Fusō ( <unk> ) was a central @-@ battery ironclad built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) in the 1870s . She was built in the United Kingdom because such ships could not yet be constructed in Japan . The ship participated in the First Sino @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 where she was damaged during the Battle of the Yalu River in 1894 and participated in the Battle of Weihaiwei in early 1895 . She collided with two Japanese ships during a storm and sank in 1897 . She was refloated the following year and repaired . Fusō played a minor role in the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 and was reclassified as a coast defense ship after the war . She was struck from the Navy List in 1908 and sold for scrap the following year .

 Tensions between Japan and China heightened after the former launched its punitive expedition against Taiwan in May 1874 in retaliation of the murder of a number of shipwrecked sailors by the Paiwan aborigines . China inquired into the possibility of buying ironclad warships from Great Britain and Japan was already negotiating with the Brazilian government about the purchase of the ironclad Independencia then under construction in Britain . The Japanese terminated the negotiations with the Brazilians in October after the ship was badly damaged upon launching and the expeditionary force was about to withdraw from Taiwan . The crisis illustrated the need to reinforce the IJN and a budget request was submitted that same month by Acting Navy Minister Kawamura Sumiyoshi for ¥ 3 @.@ 9 – 4 @.@ 2 million to purchase three warships from abroad . No Japanese shipyard was able to build ships of this size so they were ordered from Great Britain . This was rejected as too expensive and a revised request of ¥ 2 @.@ 3 million was approved later that month . Nothing was done until March 1875 when Kawamura proposed to buy one ironclad for half of the money authorized and use the rest for shipbuilding and gun production at the Yokosuka Shipyard . No response was made by the Prime Minister 's office before the proposal was revised to use all of the allocated money to buy three ships , one iron @-@ hulled armored warship and two armored corvettes of composite construction to be designed by the prominent British naval architect Sir Edward Reed , formerly the Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy . Reed would also supervise the construction of the ships for an honorarium of five percent of the construction cost . The Prime Minister 's office approved the revised proposal on 2 May and notified the Japanese consul , Ueno <unk> , that navy officers would be visiting to negotiate the contract with Reed . 
 Commander Matsumura Junzō arrived in London on 21 July and gave Reed the specifications for the ships . Reed responded on 3 September with an offer , excluding armament , that exceeded the amount allocated in the budget . Ueno signed the contracts for all three ships on 24 September despite this problem because Reed was scheduled to depart for a trip to Russia and the matter had to be concluded before his departure . Ueno had informed the Navy Ministry about the costs before signing , but Kawamura 's response to postpone the order for the armored frigate did not arrive until 8 October . The totals for all three contracts came to £ 433 @,@ 850 or ¥ 2 @,@ 231 @,@ 563 and did not include the armament . These were ordered from Krupp with a 50 percent down payment of £ 24 @,@ 978 . The government struggled to provide the necessary money even though the additional expenses had been approved by the Prime Minister 's office on 5 June 1876 , especially as more money was necessary to fully equip the ships for sea and to provision them for the delivery voyage to Japan . 
 = = Description = = 
 The design of Fusō was based on a scaled @-@ down version of HMS Iron Duke , an Audacious @-@ class central @-@ battery ironclad , familiar to the Japanese as the flagship of the Royal Navy China Station from 1871 – 75 . The ship was 220 feet ( 67 @.@ 1 m ) long between perpendiculars and had a beam of 48 feet ( 14 @.@ 6 m ) . She had a forward draft of 17 feet 9 inches ( 5 @.@ 4 m ) and drew 18 feet 5 inches ( 5 @.@ 6 m ) aft . She displaced 2 @,@ 248 long tons ( 2 @,@ 284 t ) and had a crew of 26 officers and 269 enlisted men . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Fusō had a pair of two @-@ cylinder , double @-@ expansion trunk steam engines made by John Penn and Sons , each driving a two @-@ bladed 15 @-@ foot @-@ 6 @-@ inch ( 4 @.@ 7 m ) propeller . Eight cylindrical boilers provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of 4 @.@ 09 bar ( 409 kPa ; 59 psi ) . The engines were designed to produce 3 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 600 kW ) to give the ships a speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) . During her sea trials on 3 January 1878 , she reached a maximum speed of 13 @.@ 16 knots ( 24 @.@ 37 km / h ; 15 @.@ 14 mph ) from 3 @,@ 824 ihp ( 2 @,@ 852 kW ) . The ship carried a maximum of 350 long tons ( 360 t ) of coal , enough to steam 4 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 300 km ; 5 @,@ 200 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The three @-@ masted ironclad was barque @-@ rigged and had a sail area of 17 @,@ 000 square feet ( 1 @,@ 579 m2 ) . To reduce wind resistance while under sail alone , the funnel was semi @-@ retractable . 
 The ship was modernized at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal beginning in 1891 . Her masts were removed and the fore- and mizzenmasts were replaced by two military masts also fitted with fighting tops . Her funnel was fixed in height and she received four new cylindrical boilers . To offset the reduced number of boilers , the new ones were fitted with forced draught which increased their working pressure to 6 @.@ 13 bar ( 613 kPa ; 89 psi ) . The space made available by removal of the boilers was used to increase her coal storage by 36 long tons ( 37 t ) . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 Fusō was fitted with four 20 @-@ caliber 24 @-@ centimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) Krupp rifled breech @-@ loading ( RBL ) guns and two 22 @-@ caliber RBL 17 @-@ centimeter ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) Krupp guns . The 24 cm guns were mounted at the corners of the armored citadel on the main deck at an angle of 65 degrees to the centerline of the ship . Each gun could traverse 35 degrees to the left and right . Only the 60 @-@ degree arc at the bow and stern could not be fired upon . The two pivot @-@ mounted 17 @-@ centimeter guns were positioned on the sides of the upper deck , each with three gun ports that allowed them to act as chase guns , firing fore and aft , as well as on the broadside . The ship also carried four long and two short 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns , the latter intended for use ashore or mounted on the ship 's boats . 
 The armor @-@ piercing shell of the 24 @-@ centimeter gun weighed 352 @.@ 7 pounds ( 160 kg ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 560 ft / s ( 475 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate 15 @.@ 5 inches ( 393 mm ) of wrought iron armor at the muzzle . The 132 @.@ 3 @-@ pound ( 60 kg ) 17 @-@ centimeter shell had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 510 – 1 @,@ 600 ft / s ( 460 – 487 m / s ) and could penetrate 10 @.@ 3 – 11 @.@ 4 inches ( 262 – 290 mm ) of armor . The only data available for the 75 @-@ millimeter guns is their muzzle velocities of 1 @,@ 550 ft / s ( 473 m / s ) and 960 ft / s ( 292 m / s ) for the long and short @-@ barreled guns respectively . 
 During the 1880s the armament of Fusō was augmented several times . In June 1883 seven quadruple @-@ barreled 25 @.@ 4 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 0 in ) Nordenfelt machine guns were added for defense against torpedo boats . Five were positioned on the upper deck and one each in the fighting tops . Three years later two quintuple @-@ barreled 11 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) Nordenfeldt machine guns were mounted in the fighting tops . Slightly earlier , Fusō became the first ship in the IJN to mount 356 @-@ millimeter ( 14 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes for Schwartzkopff torpedoes when two above @-@ water , <unk> tubes , one on each broadside , were added in late 1885 . She first fired these weapons on 14 January 1886 although further testing revealed that the torpedoes were often damaged by the impact with the water . Upon the recommendation of the prominent French naval architect Louis @-@ Émile Bertin , a " spoon " was added to the ends of the tubes to make the torpedoes strike the water horizontally which better distributed the shock of impact . The modifications were made and successful tests were conducted before the end of the year . 
 When the ship was being refitted from 1891 – 94 , her anti @-@ torpedo boat armament was reinforced by the replacement of three 25 @.@ 4 @-@ millimeter Nordenfelt guns by a pair of 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns and a single 3 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss gun . Two additional 11 @-@ millimeter Nordenfelt guns in the fighting tops were also added at that time . After the Sino @-@ Japanese War , a small poop deck was added in 1896 and a quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 12 @-@ centimetre ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) gun was mounted there as the stern chase gun . Another such gun was mounted on the forecastle as the forward chase gun and the two 17 @-@ centimeter guns were replaced by another pair of 12 @-@ centimeter quick @-@ firers . In addition twelve 3 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns were added and the 11 @-@ millimeter guns were replaced by 25 @.@ 4 @-@ millimeter <unk> . In March 1900 the 12 @-@ centimeter chase guns were superseded by two QF 15 @-@ centimetre ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) guns and the former chase guns were shifted to make room for them . The final change to Fusō 's armament was made in July 1906 when her obsolete 24 @-@ centimeter guns were replaced by two QF 15 @-@ centimeter guns and two more 3 @-@ pounders were added . 
 Fusō had a wrought @-@ iron waterline armor belt 9 inches ( 229 mm ) thick amidships that tapered to 6 @.@ 4 inches ( 162 mm ) at the ends of the ship . The sides of the central battery were 9 inches thick and the transverse bulkheads were 8 inches ( 203 mm ) thick . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Given a classical name for Japan , Fusō was built at the Samuda Brothers shipyard in Cubitt Town , London . Japanese sources universally give the date for Kongō 's keel @-@ laying as 24 September 1875 — the same as that for the awarding of the contract — but historian Hans Langerer describes this as improbable , arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand . Fusō was launched on 14 April 1877 when Ueno Ikuko , wife of the Japanese consul , cut the retaining rope with a hammer and chisel . Completed in January 1878 , the ship sailed for Japan before 22 March under the command of a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage . While transiting the Suez Canal , she was lightly damaged when she ran aground on 27 April . She received temporary repairs at a local dockyard and arrived in Yokohama on 11 June . She was classified as a second @-@ class warship while still in transit . She was transferred to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 17 June for permanent repairs . On 10 July a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama for the receipt of the ship that was attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials . The ship was then opened for tours by the nobility , their families and invited guests for three days after the ceremony . Beginning on 14 July , the general public was allowed to tour the ship for a week . 
 Fusō was assigned to the Tokai Naval District and the Standing Fleet in 1880 . That same year she transported the Naval Lord , Enomoto Takeaki , on a tour of Hokkaido . On 10 August 1881 she departed with Emperor Meiji on a tour of Aomori Prefecture and Otaru , Hokkaido that lasted until 30 September . The ship was transferred to the Medium Fleet in 1882 and made port visits in Kyushu and Pusan , Korea the following year . Fusō visited Hong Kong and Shanghai , China in 1884 . She hosted Empress <unk> for the launching ceremony of the corvette Musashi on 30 March 1886 and was transferred to the Small Standing Fleet in 1887 . The ship made a lengthy cruise in the Western Pacific in 1888 and visited ports in Korea , Russia and China the following year . Fusō participated in the fleet maneuvers on 25 March 1880 and then hosted Emperor Meiji for his visits to Kure , Sasebo , and Etajima . From November 1891 to July 1894 , Fusō was extensively refitted and partially modernized at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal . 
 During the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894 , Fusō was assigned to the rear of the Japanese main body and was heavily engaged by the Chinese ships . Although hit many times by 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) shells , not one penetrated her armor ; of her crew only five were killed and nine wounded . During the battle her crew fired twenty @-@ nine 24 cm , thirty @-@ two 17 cm , one hundred thirty @-@ six 75 mm , one hundred sixty @-@ four <unk> and 3 @-@ pounder shells and over fifteen hundred shells from her machine guns . The ship was present during the Battle of Weihaiwei in January – February 1895 , although she did not see any significant combat . On 29 October 1897 , Fusō 's anchor chain broke during a strong gale off <unk> , Ehime and she collided with the ram of the protected cruiser Matsushima at 16 : 30 . She then struck Matsushima 's sister ship , Itsukushima , and sank at 16 : 57 . Re @-@ classed as a second @-@ class battleship on 21 March 1898 and refloated on 7 July , Fusō was repaired at Kure Naval Arsenal and ran her trials on 8 April 1900 . 
 Fusō served as the flagship of Rear Admiral <unk> Hosoya , Seventh Division , Third Squadron , during the Russo @-@ Japanese War and was held in reserve south of Tsushima Island during the Battle of Tsushima in case the battle drifted her way . On 7 September 1904 , her 15 @-@ centimeter guns were dismounted for use in the Siege of Port Arthur . They were replaced by guns transferred from the damaged Akashi at Maizuru Naval Arsenal on 28 December . She was reclassified as a coast defense ship in December 1905 , and stricken on 1 April 1908 . Relegated to the status of a " miscellaneous service craft " , she was assigned to the Yokosuka Harbor Master until she was ordered to be sold on 15 February 1909 . Yokosuka reported her sale on 30 November , but provided no information on the date of sale or the name of the winning bidder . 
 = SMS München = 
 SMS München ( " His Majesty 's Ship München " ) was the fifth of seven Bremen @-@ class cruisers of the Imperial German Navy , named after the city of Munich . She was built by AG Weser in Bremen , starting in 1903 , launched in April 1904 , and commissioned in January 1905 . Armed with a main battery of ten 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns and two 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , München was capable of a top speed of 22 @.@ 5 knots ( 41 @.@ 7 km / h ; 25 @.@ 9 mph ) . 
 München served with the fleet for the majority of her career , and saw extensive service during World War I , including at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 . There , she engaged British light cruisers on two instances , and was damaged in both ; she contributed to the damaging of the cruiser HMS Southampton during the latter engagement . München was torpedoed by the British submarine HMS E38 on 19 October 1916 , and was subsequently withdrawn from service . She spent the final year of the war as a barracks ship , and was surrendered as a war prize to the British in 1920 . München was later broken up for scrap . 
 = = Construction = = 
 München was ordered under the contract name " M " and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in 1903 and launched on 30 April 1904 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 10 January 1905 . The ship was 111 @.@ 1 meters ( 365 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 13 @.@ 3 m ( 44 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 47 m ( 17 @.@ 9 ft ) forward . She displaced 3 @,@ 780 t ( 3 @,@ 720 long tons ; 4 @,@ 170 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two triple @-@ expansion engines , designed to give 10 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 7 @,@ 500 kW ) for a top speed of 22 knots ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) . The engines were powered by ten coal @-@ fired Marine @-@ type water @-@ tube boilers . München carried up to 860 tonnes ( 850 long tons ) of coal , which gave her a range of 4 @,@ 690 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 690 km ; 5 @,@ 400 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . She had a crew of 14 officers and 274 – 287 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with ten 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 40 guns in single mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , six were located amidships , three on either side , and two were placed side by side aft . The guns could engage targets out to 12 @,@ 200 m ( 40 @,@ 000 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 500 rounds of ammunition , for 150 shells per gun . She was also equipped with two 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes . They were submerged in the hull on the broadside . München was also fitted to carry fifty naval mines . The ship was protected by an armored deck that was up to 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides , and the guns were protected by 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick shields . 
 = = Service history = = 
 After her commissioning , München was employed as a torpedo test ship and to conduct experiments with wireless telegraphy . After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , the ship was assigned to the High Seas Fleet . She was moored in Brunsbüttel with her sister @-@ ship Danzig , en route to Kiel via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal on the morning of 28 August 1914 . That morning , the British attacked the German patrol line in the Heligoland Bight . During the ensuing Battle of Heligoland Bight , München and Danzig were recalled and ordered to steam to the mouth of the Elbe and wait for further orders . At 12 : 25 , the two cruisers were ordered to move into the Bight and support the cruiser Strassburg , but at 14 : 06 , München was instead ordered to conduct reconnaissance out to the north @-@ east of Heligoland . 
 = = = Battle of Jutland = = = 
 München was assigned to the IV Scouting Group during the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 . The IV Scouting Group , under the command of Commodore Ludwig von Reuter , departed Wilhelmshaven at 03 : 30 on 31 May , along with the rest of the fleet . Tasked with screening for the fleet , München and the torpedo boat S54 were positioned on the starboard side of the fleet , abreast of the III Battle Squadron . 
 Later in the battle , shortly after 21 : 00 , München and the rest of the IV Scouting Group encountered the British 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron ( 3rd LCS ) . Reuter 's ships were leading the High Seas Fleet south , away from the deployed Grand Fleet . Due to the long range and poor visibility , only München and SMS Stettin were able to engage the British cruisers ; München fired 63 shells before she had to cease fire , without scoring any hits . She was hit twice in return , however ; the first hit caused minimal damage , but the second struck her third funnel . The resulting explosion damaged four of her boilers , making it difficult for her to keep steam up in all of her boilers . Reuter turned his ships hard to starboard , in order to draw the British closer to the capital ships of the German fleet , but the 3rd LCS refused to take the bait and disengaged . 
 During the ferocious night fighting that occurred as the High Seas Fleet forced its way through the British rear , the IV Scouting Group encountered the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron at close range in the darkness . As the two squadrons closed on each other , the Germans illuminated HMS Southampton and HMS Dublin and concentrated their fire on the two ships . The two ships were badly damaged and set on fire and forced to retreat , while the Germans also fell back in an attempt to bring the British closer to the battlecruisers Moltke and Seydlitz . In the melee , the cruiser Frauenlob was hit and sunk by a torpedo launched by Southampton , and München nearly collided with the sinking Frauenlob . She managed to evade the wreck , and she then fired a torpedo at Southampton , but it missed . München was hit another three times during this engagement ; two of the hits exploded in the water , causing minor splinter damage . The third shell went through the second funnel and exploded on a funnel support on the other side ; one of the shell splinters knocked out the starboard rangefinder . The erratic maneuvering bent a wheel shaft in the helm , forcing her crew to steer the ship from the steering gear compartment for about two and a half hours . 
 At 01 : 20 , München and Stettin briefly fired on the German torpedo boats G11 , V1 , and V3 before they discovered their identity . Early on the morning of 1 June , around 05 : 06 , the pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron opened fire on what they thought were British submarines ; the firing was so hysterical that it threatened to damage München and Stettin , as they were steaming up the side of the German line . The fleet commander , Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer , was forced to give a general " cease @-@ fire " order . München in turn spotted an imaginary submarine off Heligoland at 11 : 40 and opened fire on the empty <unk> the course of the battle , München was hit by a total of five medium @-@ caliber shells , which killed eight men and wounded another twenty . She had fired 161 rounds from her guns . 
 = = = Later operations = = = 
 On 18 – 19 October , Scheer attempted a repeat of the original Jutland plan , which had called for a bombardment of Sunderland . While en route , München was hit by a torpedo launched by the submarine HMS E38 off the Dogger Bank . Scheer became convinced the British knew his location , and so he cancelled the operation and returned to port . München took on some 500 metric tons ( 490 long tons ; 550 short tons ) of water , and saltwater got into her boilers , contaminating the freshwater used to produce steam . She had to be taken under tow , first by the torpedo boat V73 , and then by her sister Berlin . By the following day , her engines were back in operation , and she steamed into the <unk> under her own power , where she entered the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven . After returning to port , München was decommissioned in November due to the battle damage incurred the previous month . She was later employed as a barracks ship for patrol ships in 1918 . She was stricken from the naval register on 5 November 1919 and ceded to the British as the war prize Q on 6 July 1920 under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles . They subsequently broke her up for scrap .

 The 1903 – 04 season was the first season in Bradford City A.F.C. ' s history , having been founded on 29 May 1903 and then elected into the Football League to replace Doncaster Rovers in the Second Division . They finished in 10th position in the league and reached the fourth qualifying round of the FA Cup . 
 Bradford City were formed following a series of meetings during the first half of 1903 and replaced the former rugby league club of Manningham , whose Valley Parade ground they used . The club had already signed six players before they were accepted into the league before the rest of the side were later signed by a five @-@ man committee . The board directors appointed Robert Campbell as the club 's first manager . Bradford City 's first game ended in a 2 – 0 defeat at Grimsby Town and the first home game resulted in another loss to Gainsborough Trinity . Club captain Johnny McMillan finished the top goalscorer with 14 league and two FA Cup goals .

 Organised league football had been played in the West Riding of Yorkshire since 1894 in the West Yorkshire League , but no side from the county had played in the Football League . So on 30 January 1903 , Scotsman James Whyte , a sub @-@ editor of the Bradford Observer , met with Football Association representative John Brunt at Valley Parade , the home of the city 's rugby league side Manningham Football Club , to discuss establishing a Football League club within Bradford . In May , Manningham 's committee decided to swap codes from rugby to association football and so the Football League decided to invite Bradford City to join their league in a bid to introduce association football to the West Riding , the main sport in which was rugby league . The League voted in favour of replacing Doncaster Rovers , who had finished the 1902 – 03 season in 16th position in the Second Division , with Bradford City even though Bradford had yet to play a single game .

 Even before Bradford City were guaranteed a place in the Football League , the club made its first acquisitions by signing Jack Forrest and Ben Prosser from Stoke on 1 May . These were followed by four more players joining the club ; Sam Bright , George Robinson , Peter O 'Rourke and Jimmy Millar . Despite not having enough players to field a full side , four club representatives travelled to London by the end of May for a league management committee meeting , when the club was elected into the Second Division . Money was raised to fund the club , including at least £ 2 @,@ 000 from sponsors , a balance of £ 500 from Manningham FC and proceeds from a summer archery tournament . Bradford City also took over Manningham 's Valley Parade ground for their home fixtures . 
 The four @-@ strong party which visited London , as well as newly elected Alfred Ayrton made up five members of a 13 @-@ man sub @-@ committee which controlled club affairs . The first five , who also included J. Brunt , J.E. <unk> , A.J. Foxcroft and J.T. Whyte , were responsible for first team matters . On 20 June , the club directors appointed former Sunderland secretary @-@ manager Robert Campbell as Bradford City 's first manager from a shortlist of 30 applicants . Campbell 's role was to coach the players , helped by trainer George Cutts . Ayrton , who had been president of Manningham FC , became the club 's first chairman . 
 Bradford played no recorded pre @-@ season friendlies . Instead , Campbell and Cutts , decided on the first selection for the opening game of the season with Grimsby Town by playing a series of Whites v Stripes games between professionals already signed by the club and amateur players . The first squad was signed at a cost of £ 917 10s 0d , with the players choosing Johnny McMillan as their own captain .

Graham , Beckram and Guy all came close to giving City an opening day lead , but Grimsby scored through Archie Dunn . After City were reduced to ten men because of an injury to Guy , Fred Rouse doubled Grimsby 's lead in the second half ; Grimsby finished the victors 2 – 0 . Four days later , City hosted their first home at Valley Parade against Gainsborough Trinity . The game attracted 11 @,@ 000 spectators even though there was no covered accommodation for fans . Among the spectators was Bradford 's Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress . City lost 3 – 1 with Guy scoring the club 's first ever league goal , but they also had a goal disallowed and missed a penalty . The Bradford Daily Argus reported that the goal was " greeted with a shout which awoke babies on the distant hillsides of Bolton and <unk> . The match highlights were shown in Bradford 's St George 's Hall later in the same evening . 
 Bradford won their first game in the league in their third game of the season , with a 2 – 0 victory against Burton United at Peel Croft . A week later , they won their first game at their Valley Parade home by defeating Bristol City 1 – 0 . McMillan scored in each game , with Forrest also scoring against Burton .

The first qualifying round match and the club 's debut in the competition was a 6 – 1 victory against Rockingham Colliery with six different City players on the scoresheet . City progressed through the following two qualifying rounds against Mirfield United and Worksop Town , with all three games being held at Valley Parade . 
 During October , City also hosted an inter @-@ league game between the English and Irish Leagues at Valley Parade .

 City went another two weeks before playing again when their FA Cup run came to an end with a 2 – 1 defeat at their fellow Second Division side Chesterfield in the fourth qualifying round . They returned to league action on 21 November against Bolton Wanderers , nearly a month since their win against Barnsley . Drain , who had scored on his debut against Barnsley , scored Bradford 's first ever hat @-@ trick , but the game finished in a 3 – 3 draw . A week later , Drain scored for the third successive league match but City lost 3 – 2 to Burnley . 
 Bradford played six games during December , with the first two ending in draws against Preston North End and Stockport County . On 19 December , City defeated Leicester Fosse 4 – 0 at Valley Parade . It was City 's highest league victory of the season with McMillan scoring his side 's second hat @-@ trick of the campaign . City finished the month with three games in the space of four days . They first lost 4 – 1 to Woolwich Arsenal on Christmas Day , before a 1 – 0 victory at Blackpool . The year finished with a draw against Port Vale .

 At the turn of the new year , City were defeated by Gainsborough Trinity , before they completed their first double by defeating Burton United 3 – 0 . Two draws followed – against Bristol City and Manchester United . City extended their unbeaten run by winning all three matches during February , with victories against Glossop , Barnsley and Lincoln City . Each victory finished 2 – 1 with Beckram , Drain and Robinson all scoring twice during the month . The club 's six @-@ game unbeaten run came to an end in the return fixture at Glossop , with further defeats following against Stockport County and Chesterfield .

City lost 1 – 0 to Bolton Wanderers before a 2 – 1 victory followed against Leicester Fosse , with McMillan scoring one of the goals . The final two matches both ended in defeats without City scoring ; first to Arsenal , then to Blackpool . City finished 10th at the end of the first season recording 31 points from 34 games . 
 Team captain McMillan finished as the club 's top scorer with 14 goals . He played 32 games , with goalkeeper Seymour , half @-@ back Robinson and forward Graham all being ever @-@ presents . With the advent of league football in Bradford , thousands of people came to home games , resulting in the club 's end @-@ of @-@ season receipts totalling £ 3 @,@ 896 . It resulted in a small operating loss from the first season , but donations helped the club record a profit of £ 39 in their first season in the Football League . Following the end of the season , the club released six players and also sold Guy to Leeds City .

 = The Boat Race 1966 = 
 The 112th Boat Race took place on 26 March 1966 . Held annually , the event is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . The race was won by Oxford by three @-@ and @-@ three @-@ quarter @-@ lengths . Isis won the reserve race while Cambridge won the Women 's Boat Race . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities , followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the previous year 's race by three @-@ and @-@ three @-@ quarter lengths . Cambridge , however , held the overall lead with 61 victories to Oxford 's 49 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Up until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race . 
 Two days before the main race and in inclement weather , the Cambridge boat began to sink and was pushed into barges and tugs moored below Beverley Brook . The crew were rescued and according to their boat club president Mike Sweeney , the incident would have no impact on the Light Blues : " we shall just get into our other boat and race in that " . It was the first Boat Race vessel to sink since the 1951 race . The Light Blues would row in the same boat in which they won the 1962 and 1964 races , while Oxford 's craft was manufactured by Swiss firm <unk> Racing Boats . Both boats were German @-@ rigged , where the number four and five row on the bow side . The inclement weather continued until the day of the race , with further disruption predicted and the threat of postponement a real one . The race was umpired by the former Cambridge University Boat Club president and rower Alan Burrough who took part in Cambridge 's victory in the 1939 race . 
 The Cambridge crew were coached by D. C. Christie ( who rowed for Cambridge in the 1958 and 1959 races ) , J. G. P. Crowden ( who won Blues in the 1951 and the 1952 races ) , D. M. Jennens ( who rowed three times between 1949 and 1951 ) and I. W. Welsh ( who participated in the 1956 race ) . Oxford 's coach was Ronnie Howard who had rowed for the Dark Blues in the 1957 and 1959 races . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 13 st 7 lb ( 85 @.@ 5 kg ) , 1 @.@ 6 pounds ( 0 @.@ 7 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . Oxonians Chris and Richard Freeman became the first brothers to row in the Boat Race since 1935 race . The Oxford crew contained a single former Blue , the boat club president and number two Duncan Clegg , while Cambridge saw Rodney Ward and stroke Mike <unk> return . Oxford 's P. G. Tuke was following in the footsteps of his great grandfather F. E. Tuke who had rowed in the 1845 race . There were three non @-@ British participants in the race , the Oxford cox Jim Rogers , and Cambridge rowers J. H. Ashby and P. H. Conze were all American .

 Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station . Despite the prediction of poor weather and the threat of postponement , the race commenced at the planned time of <unk> Oxford made the better start and were half @-@ a @-@ length up on Cambridge , but with the advantage of the Middlesex bend , the Light Blues were one second behind at the Mile Post . Oxford reacted to a Cambridge push at Harrods Furniture Depository to maintain the lead which they extended to two seconds by Hammersmith Bridge . The Dark Blues continued to contain Cambridge 's attempts to reduce the deficit and by Chiswick Steps had clear water with a three @-@ second advantage . Pushing away once again , and with a two @-@ length lead , Oxford 's cox Jim Rogers steered them across the Cambridge boat to the Middlesex side , and were ten seconds ahead at Barnes Bridge . Oxford won by three @-@ and @-@ three @-@ quarter lengths in a time of 19 minutes 12 seconds . 
 In the reserve race , and after a false start , Oxford 's Isis beat Cambridge 's Goldie by seventh lengths , their second consecutive victory , in a time of 19 minutes 22 seconds . In the 21st running of the Women 's Boat Race , Cambridge triumphed , their fourth consecutive victory .

 SM U @-@ 12 or U @-@ XII was a U @-@ 5 @-@ class submarine or U @-@ boat built for and operated by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ( German : Kaiserliche und Königliche Kriegsmarine or K.u.K. Kriegsmarine ) before and during the First World War . 
 = = Introduction = = 
 Built on speculation by Whitehead & Co. of Fiume , the submarine was launched as SS @-@ 3 and featured improvements in the electrical and mechanical systems from the design by the American John Philip Holland , to which her older sister boats , SM U @-@ 5 and U @-@ 6 , had been built . 
 SS @-@ 3 was laid down in 1909 and launched in March 1911 . The double @-@ hulled submarine was just over 105 feet ( 32 m ) long and displaced between 240 and 273 tonnes ( 265 and 301 short tons ) , depending on whether surfaced or submerged . Whitehead 's tried selling SS @-@ 3 to several different navies , but she was finally bought by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy after the outbreak of World War I , despite having been rejected by them twice before . She was commissioned as U @-@ 12 in August 1914 . 
 The submarine sank only one ship , a Greek cargo ship in May 1915 , but she had earlier captured six Montenegrin sailing vessels as prizes in March . U @-@ 12 also damaged , but did not sink , the French battleship Jean Bart in December 1914 . While searching for targets in the vicinity of Venice in August 1915 , U @-@ 12 struck a mine that blew her stern off , and sank with all hands , becoming the first Austro @-@ Hungarian submarine sunk in the war . Her wreck was salvaged the next year by the Italians , who interred U @-@ 12 's crewmen in a Venetian cemetery . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 SS @-@ 3 was built on speculation by Whitehead & Co. of Fiume . Her design was based on the John Philip Holland design licensed by Whitehead for U @-@ 5 and U @-@ 6 , two submarines ordered by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy and built 1907 – 1910 , and featured improvements in the mechanical and electrical systems . SS @-@ 3 was laid down in 1909 and launched at Fiume on 14 March 1911 . 
 SS @-@ 3 's featured a single @-@ hull with a tear @-@ drop shaped body that bore a strong resemblance to modern nuclear submarines . She was 105 feet 4 inches ( 32 @.@ 11 m ) long by 13 feet 9 inches ( 4 @.@ 19 m ) abeam and had a draft of 12 feet 10 inches ( 3 @.@ 91 m ) . She displaced 240 tonnes ( 260 short tons ) surfaced , and 273 tonnes ( 301 short tons ) submerged . Her two 45 @-@ centimeter ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes featured unique , cloverleaf @-@ shaped design hatches that rotated on a central axis , and the boat was designed to carry up to four torpedoes . 
 According to one source , SS @-@ 3 was initially propelled by a pair of electric motors for surface running , but had them replaced with twin 6 @-@ cylinder gasoline engines of 300 brake horsepower ( 220 kW ) each when they proved disappointing during trials . It is not specifically reported for U @-@ 12 , but the other U @-@ 5 @-@ class boats both suffered from inadequate ventilation , which resulted in frequent intoxication of the crew from the engine exhaust . SS @-@ 3 's underwater propulsion was by two electric motors that totaled 230 shaft horsepower ( 170 kW ) . 
 = = Career = = 
 After SS @-@ 3 's March 1911 launch , Whitehead 's tried to sell SS @-@ 3 to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , but because the evaluation of the first two U @-@ 5 @-@ class boats was still underway , they declined to purchase . Over the next three years Whitehead 's attempted to sell the boat to the navies of Peru , Portugal , the Netherlands , Brazil , and Bulgaria , before the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy rejected an offer for the second time . With the outbreak of war , however , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy purchased the unsold submarine to quickly bolster its fleet . Although provisionally assigned the designation U @-@ 7 , the submarine was commissioned as SM U @-@ 12 on 21 August 1914 , with Linienschiffsleutnant Egon Lerch in command . U @-@ 12 's activities over the early part of the war are not reported , but the boat 's armament was augmented by a 3 @.@ 7 cm / 23 ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) deck gun in November 1914 . Sister boat U @-@ 5 had her first radio receiver installed at the same time her deck gun was added , but it is not reported whether U @-@ 12 did as well . 
 On 21 December 1914 , Lerch and U @-@ 12 chanced upon the French dreadnought Jean Bart in the Straits of Otranto steaming at a leisurely 9 knots ( 17 km / h ) and unprotected by escort ships . U @-@ 12 hit French Admiral Lapeyrère 's flagship with a single torpedo in the bow , destroying the battleship 's wine storeroom but sparing her forward magazine . Jean Bart 's watertight compartments saved the ship , which made her way to Malta to undergo repairs at the British dockyards there . 
 U @-@ 12 survived an attack from an unknown French Brumaire @-@ class submarine on 27 February 1915 . U @-@ 12 's next success was the capture of two Montenegrin schooners on 22 March 1916 , Fiore Di <unk> and <unk> . Nine days later the U @-@ boat captured another four Montenegrin boats , Buona Forte , Fiore I , Hailie , and <unk> . On 29 May , she sank the Greek steamer Virginia , which was the only ship reported sunk by U @-@ 12 . In June , U @-@ 12 underwent a refit that added an additional two torpedo tubes on her forward casing . 
 In early August , Lerch and U @-@ 12 set out from Pola for Venice to look for enemy ships to sink . On 6 August , the Italian destroyer Rosolino Pilo rammed U @-@ 12 , probably by chance , at about 05 : 00 in the Lido inlet of the Venetian Lagoon . Two days later , when Italian workers were dredging to try to determine the object Rosolino Pilo had hit , they heard a heavy explosion . When divers went down in the area , they discovered the wreck of U @-@ 12 with her stern blown off . U @-@ 12 's entire complement of 17 men was lost when she went down . U @-@ 12 was the first Austro @-@ Hungarian submarine sunk during the war . 
 In late 1916 , the Italians salvaged the hulk of U @-@ 12 and transported it to Venice . The bodies of U @-@ 12 's crew were interred at the San Michele cemetery in Venice , and U @-@ 12 's hulk , of no salvage value , was scrapped at the Venice naval arsenal . In her military service , U @-@ 12 sank one ship of 1 @,@ 065 GRT , damaged one warship ( 22 @,@ 189 GRT ) , and captured six ships as prizes .

 = Hudson Valley Rail Trail = 
 The Hudson Valley Rail Trail is a paved 4 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) east – west rail trail in the town of Lloyd in Ulster County , New York , stretching from the Hudson River through the hamlet of Highland . The trail was originally part of the Poughkeepsie Bridge Route , a rail corridor that crossed the Hudson via the Poughkeepsie Bridge . Controlled by a variety of railroads throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , the bridge was damaged and became unusable after a 1974 fire . By the 1980s the corridor 's then @-@ owner , Conrail , had routed all rail traffic in the region north through Selkirk , and was eager to relieve itself of the bridge and adjoining rights @-@ of @-@ way . In 1984 , it sold the entire property for one dollar to a felon who did not maintain it or pay taxes on it . The section of the corridor west of the Hudson was seized by Ulster County in 1991 and transferred to the town of Lloyd . 
 During the 1990s , a broadband utility seeking to lay fiber optic cable paid the town to pass through the former corridor . The town used part of its payment to pave the route and open it as a public rail trail in 1997 . The creation of the trail was supported by a local Rotary club , which built a pavilion along the trail . The pavilion includes a donated antique caboose . While the trail originally ended at Route 44 – 55 , it was extended eastward between 2009 and 2010 , intersecting Route 9W and continuing to the Poughkeepsie Bridge . The extension was paid for by stimulus funding . 
 The bridge , now a pedestrian walkway called Walkway Over the Hudson , connects the trail with the Dutchess Rail Trail to the east , creating a 30 @-@ mile ( 48 km ) rail trail system that spans the Hudson . The trail is expected to be extended west , where it will border Route 299 . As it passes through Highland , the trail is carried by several bridges , connects to four parking areas , and traverses a wetlands complex .

 The Hudson Valley Rail Trail is part of the former rail corridor that comprised the Poughkeepsie Bridge Route . It ran east through the hamlet of Highland in the town of Lloyd over the Hudson River via the Poughkeepsie Bridge . Highland has historically been Lloyd 's largest population center . The corridor was , throughout its history , operated by the Central New England , Philadelphia and Reading , New Haven , Erie , Ontario and Western , Lehigh and New England and Penn Central railroads . Under the ownership of Penn Central , traffic along the bridge route was discouraged in favor of a northern route through Selkirk ; the use of newer technology at Selkirk Yard to improve efficiency was cited as the primary reason . At one point the Poughkeepsie corridor had been the primary thoroughfare for freight being shipped to New England , and the New Haven yard at nearby <unk> was once " the largest railroad yard east of the Mississippi River " . Rail traffic over the Poughkeepsie Bridge stopped entirely after the bridge was damaged in a 1974 fire . 
 After Penn Central went bankrupt , Conrail assumed control of the corridor , but opposed renovating it due to budgetary concerns . Rail traffic up to the bridge continued until March 1982 , when Conrail received permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to completely cease using the corridor ; the tracks were removed the following year . Donald L. Pevsner , a transportation lawyer from Florida , secured a first @-@ refusal option for purchasing the corridor to create restaurants and tourist attractions , but allowed it to expire on November 1 , 1984 , because he could not secure financial backing ; he claims that Conrail expressed a desire to sell the corridor , at that point a potential liability , to the " first warm body " that would buy it . Conrail immediately sold the Poughkeepsie Bridge and adjoining rights @-@ of @-@ way on November 2 , 1984 , for one dollar to Gordon Schreiber Miller , a convicted bank fraudster who " seemed uncertain what he wished to do " with the corridor . Miller did not pay taxes , fines or insurance on the corridor , or maintain it . He went bankrupt in 1990 and sold the corridor for one dollar to his friend Vito Moreno , who also did not pay taxes on it . In 1991 , Ulster County seized the right @-@ of @-@ way west of the Poughkeepsie Bridge and gave over 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) of the abandoned corridor to the town of Lloyd . 
 = = = Conversion to trail = = = 
 Parcels of the right @-@ of @-@ way between Lloyd and the neighboring town of New Paltz were sold off by the county shortly before ownership of the remaining corridor was transferred to Lloyd and converted to a rail trail . Roughly $ 400 @,@ 000 in funding to convert the corridor to a trail was acquired through an easement from the town of Lloyd to a broadband utility for the laying of fiber optic cable , though only $ 70 @,@ 000 was needed to pave the trail . The trail remains a right @-@ of @-@ way for the fiber optic line . The development of the trail was supported by Highland 's Rotary club , which has since built several utilities for trail users , including a pavilion , garden and parking lot . The corridor was officially opened as a trail in 1997 . Initially 2 @.@ 5 to 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 to 4 @.@ 8 km ) long , it stretched from Riverside Road in the west to Vineyard Avenue in the east ; the removal of an overpass on Vineyard Avenue , as well as a blockage under a bridge on U.S. Route 9W , prevented the trail from continuing east to the Poughkeepsie Bridge . 
 Lloyd received a $ 224 @,@ 000 state and federal grant in the summer of 2000 to create such a connection . Additional funding for the eastern extension was provided in November 2006 , when the state granted $ 1 @.@ 5 million to construct a bridge and a tunnel , and to complete the path . Lloyd received a $ 7 @,@ 500 grant in 2002 to extend the trail west to the Black Creek Wetlands Complex ; the town received an additional grant for $ 20 @,@ 000 in May 2005 to complete the Black Creek extension . 
 In 2006 , a local businessman donated an antique caboose to the trail Association ; this was placed beside the pavilion . Built in 1915 , it was " one of ... the first <unk> made of steel instead of wood " . An October 2007 study of paint chips from the caboose found the paint contained lead . The study was released less than a week before a town supervisor election in Lloyd ; one of the candidates , Ray Costantino , was president of the Hudson Valley Rail Trail Association , and one of the early proponents of the trail . He claimed the timing of the study was politically motivated . Costantino subsequently became town supervisor , and the caboose had its paint replaced and was repaired at a total cost of $ 4 @,@ 500 . A second caboose , dating from 1926 , is located at the trail 's parking lot on Haviland Road . 
 Lloyd 's police department became the first in the county to purchase a Segway , in 2007 , for the express purpose of patrolling the rail trail . The trail has been occasionally vandalized . Lloyd 's Police Chief felt that use of such a vehicle would enable officers to patrol the trail for longer periods of time , and that it could also be used to patrol other areas of the town . Seven officers were expected to use the Segway , which contains an automated external defibrillator , and can go as fast as 12 1 ⁄ 2 miles per hour ( 20 @.@ 1 km / h ) . 
 In March 2009 , Ulster County received almost $ 21 million in stimulus funds . The funding included a $ 3 @.@ 16 million project to complete the trail between Lloyd and the Poughkeepsie Bridge . Some funding for the architectural and engineering aspects of the project came from the reserve fund created after the town 's fiber optic deal . The Rail Trail Association also received a $ 1 @,@ 500 grant from a public @-@ benefit corporation , the Hudson River Valley Greenway , to print brochures . Construction for the 1 @.@ 28 @-@ mile ( 2 @.@ 06 km ) section was underway by that September . In March 2010 , a portion of New Paltz Road was closed pending the replacement of a bridge over the trail . 
 The official groundbreaking ceremony took place on May 4 , 2010 , and the trail was expected to be completed by October . The bridge over Vineyard Avenue was opened to pedestrian traffic on July 16 , 2010 . The only remaining obstruction was the placement of a bridge carrying Mile Hill Road over the trail , which was expected to be completed in August . The crossing at US 9W had been remedied ; the new section let " users to cross either over or under " the highway . To celebrate the opening of the Vineyard Avenue bridge , Route 44 – 55 throughout Highland ( which includes Vineyard Avenue ) was shut down for the day . The eastern expansion does not deviate from the original route of the corridor , and officially opened on October 2 , 2010 . 
 Between June 23 and 24 , 2011 , parts of the trail were spray @-@ painted with " dozens of [ ... ] words and images " . Volunteers who removed some of the graffiti believed that different types of paint were used . Lloyd 's highway superintendent noted similar vandalism elsewhere in the town , and Town Supervisor Ray Costantino stated that the incident would cause Lloyd residents to feel a personal connection to the trail and become outraged . 
 Future expansion to the trail includes a 1 @-@ mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) extension to the west , to State Route 299 . Lloyd has received a $ 1 @.@ 93 million state grant to complete the western expansion , which will reach New Paltz by 2012 . Both Lloyd and New Paltz have received grants to establish a connection between the Hudson Valley Rail Trail and the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail . There has never been a direct link between the Poughkeepsie Bridge and the Wallkill Valley corridor . Other plans include the development of commercial zones along the trail , and a project to connect the trail to Illinois Mountain .

 The east – west trail begins at the Poughkeepsie Bridge , by Haviland Road . The 1 @.@ 28 @-@ mile ( 2 @.@ 06 km ) Poughkeepsie Bridge was opened as a pedestrian walkway in 2009 . The bridge is a National Recreation Trail , and connects to the Dutchess Rail Trail to the east , creating a contiguous 18 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 29 @.@ 3 km ) rail trail system that spans both Ulster and Dutchess counties . 
 The Hudson Valley trail continues 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) west from the Poughkeepsie Bridge to a bridge over Mile Hill Road , then another 0 @.@ 1 miles ( 0 @.@ 16 km ) to a crossing at US 9W .

Almost 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) from this road , the trail reaches the Black Creek Wetlands Complex . Black Creek is one of the two " principal streams " to run through Lloyd ; it bisects the town as it flows north and pools in a pond . The wetlands complex itself is important for water drainage . Part of New York State Department of Environmental Conservation region 3 , the complex contains Plutarch Swamp and one of the region 's largest dwarf shrub bogs , hosting a variety of rare species . The complex also includes the Swarte Kill , Lloyd 's second major waterway . The trail continues an additional 0 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) past the beginning of the complex to Tony Williams Park . 
 There are four parking areas along the trail , by Haviland Road , Commercial Avenue , the Rotary pavilion , and at Tony Williams Park . The trail is 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) wide and 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) long ; it is paved with asphalt and suitable for hiking , bicycling , horseback riding , roller blading , and cross country skiing . 
 = Modesta Avila = 
 Modesta Ávila ( 1867 or 1869 – September 1891 ) was a protestor in Orange County , California who became the county 's first convicted felon and first state prisoner . Avila had only received a minor warning in 1889 for placing an obstruction on the tracks to protest against the Santa Fe Railroad being built through her property without adequate compensation , but she continued to taunt the authorities , and was eventually arrested four months later . 
 Although the jury in her first trial was unable to reach agreement , Avila was convicted after a second trial at Orange County Supreme Court and was sentenced to three years in San Quentin State Prison . She died there of pneumonia in September 1891 after serving two years and seven months of her sentence . Today Avila is considered to be a folk heroine of Latino people of the county , and is suggested as the " White Lady " , a ghost said to haunt the area , reported to have been seen walking along the railroad tracks since the 1930s . 
 = = Background = = 
 Avila was born in 1867 , or 1869 according to some sources , in San Juan Capistrano , in Orange County , California , located approximately 23 miles ( 37 km ) southeast of Downtown Santa Ana . Little is known about her childhood and earlier life , but by the age of 20 she had inherited land from her mother just to the north of the Capistrano train station and was occupied in chicken rearing . Physically Avila was described as a " dark @-@ eyed beauty " in appearance and an " extremely proud woman " . The authorities would have considered her a Mexican even though she had been born in San Juan Capistrano and was technically a Mexican @-@ American or Chicana ; Mexicans were unpopular in the county at the time and subject to racism . She had spent 30 days in Los Angeles County Jail in 1888 for " vagrancy " ( often a euphemism for prostitution ) and this , coupled with the fact that she was reportedly unmarried and pregnant at the time of her second trial , led to a belief that she supplemented her income by working as a prostitute . The obituary in the Santa Ana Standard following her death in September 1891 seemed to add weight to this by referring to her as " a well @-@ known favorite of the Santa Ana boys " . 
 = = Protest = = 
 Avila was upset by the construction of the Santa Fe Railroad through her family 's land and only 15 feet away from her home , believing that she had not been properly compensated for the railway which was having a negative impact on her chicken rearing and her quality of life because of the noise . In 1889 , she decided to protest against the railroad 's incursion into her life and property . Local sources say she tied a clothesline hung with her laundry across the track , but other reports say she placed a railroad tie across the tracks and erected a fence post between the rails to which she attached a note of protest that read : " This land belongs to me . And if the railroad wants to run here , they will have to pay me ten thousand dollars " . Max Mendelson , the Southern Pacific 's agent in San Juan Capistrano , reported that he had removed the post , informed Avila that the Southern Pacific were perfectly within their rights in the building of the railroad , and ordered her not to interfere again . 
 There is some doubt over what occurred between Avila and Mendelson . Avila seemed to believe that she would be compensated , and is even documented to have traveled to a bank in Santa Ana to ask how she might receive a $ 10 @,@ 000 payment and organized a party in celebration of her expected payment . She was arrested at the party for disturbing the peace , and annoyed the authorities by boasting at her trial of her victory over the railroad company and government . According to historian Lisbeth Haas in the book Conquests and Historical Identities in California , 1769 – 1936 , it was her actions after her initial protest rather than the act itself which led to her arrest four months later for " attempted obstruction of a train " , and that she was made an example of to demonstrate that protests would be punished under the new state legal system . 
 = = Prosecution and imprisonment = = 
 The first trial of Avila for interfering with the tracks was held at the then newly opened Orange County Superior Court under Edward <unk> , a " hot shot " legal figure who was also in the state assembly . The first trial ended with a 6 @-@ 6 hung jury . In the week leading up to the retrial , rumors spread that Avila was pregnant out of wedlock , an act considered to be gravely sinful at the time . Her lawyer , George <unk> , " inexperienced and probably crooked " , was forced to confirm that she was pregnant and believed that the real decision to incarcerate her for three years in San Quentin State Prison was largely due to this , writing that " her real crime is that she is a poor girl not having sense enough to have been married " . <unk> appealed to the court on grounds that she had been " convicted on her reputation , not her deed " . He received a hearing at the Supreme Court , but lost the case on a technicality . Avila 's case was perhaps also used as the " vehicle for polishing Orange County ’ s law @-@ and @-@ order image " , as she was the first person to be convicted of a felony in the county . Avila 's boyfriend at the time was fired from his job for refusing to distance himself from her . 
 If she was pregnant , what became of her baby is unknown : no mention of it appears in the penitentiary 's records . Avila died there of pneumonia in September 1891 at the age of 22 or 24 after serving two years and five months of her sentence . Her obituary in the Santa Ana Standard concluded : " Let those who are without sin throw the first stone " .

 Today , Avila is considered to be an important figure in local legend and has been cited as a " folklore heroine " for Latinos in the county . The San Juan Capistrano Historical Society unveiled a plaque in the town commemorating her and her place in history . Mary P. Nolan , executive director of the Central Orange County YWCA , included Avila among 30 prominent " women of courage " in Orange County 's history . 
 As part of the celebrations for the centenary of the building of the Santa Fe railroad in August 1988 , a re @-@ enactment of her protest was performed near the railway station by a local woman , Irma Camarena , and actors playing Mendelson and a sheriff . City manager Steve Julian narrated : " Modesta hated the train . It was noisy , dirty and a bit frightening . It kept her chickens from laying eggs , and its whistle kept her awake at night . Plus , the powerful California Central , parent company to the Santa Fe , had paid a pittance to people for right of way through their property . Something had to be done . In an act of pure frustration , Modesta chose a symbolic act to voice her displeasure . " 
 Numerous writers on Latino oppression and history in the United States cite Avila as one of many Mexican @-@ Americans victimized during this period . Suzanne Oboler , Professor of Latin American Studies at the City University of New York , for instance , considers the imprisonment of Avila and others such as Jimmy Santiago Baca , Ricardo Sánchez , Raúl Salinas , Fred Gómez Carrasco , Judy Lucero and Alvaro Luna Hernandez to be " inextricably linked to colonial domination and the subsequent struggle for material resources in the southwestern United States " . An opera entitled Modesta Avila : An American Folk Opera written by an Orange County biomedical engineer was performed in Westminster in 1986 but was dismissed as " neo @-@ imperialist nostalgia " by B. V. <unk> in La Pinta : Chicana / o Prisoner Literature , Culture , and Politics . The Modesta Avila Coalition , an activist group in the Los Angeles area involved with fighting against firms who transport goods to and from rail yards , named themselves after her in 2005 . 
 Avila is suggested as a possible identity for the ghost , known as the " White Lady " , which has reputedly been seen in San Juan Capistrano 's Los Rios Street Historic District . The ghost was first reported walking on the railway tracks in the 1930s , along the stretch that Avila had walked . 
 = Interstate 235 ( Iowa ) = 
 Interstate 235 ( I @-@ 235 ) in Iowa is an auxiliary Interstate Highway that runs just north of downtown Des Moines through the heart of the Des Moines metropolitan area . I @-@ 235 runs from the junction of Interstate 35 and Interstate 80 in West Des Moines to the separation of the same two interstates in Ankeny . The highway is approximately 14 miles ( 23 km ) long . 
 I @-@ 235 , which had seen little improvement since its construction in the 1960s , was completely rebuilt and widened in a project that spanned most of the 2000s . Prior to the reconstruction , I @-@ 235 had two lanes in each direction with a third lane near downtown ; the entire route now has at least three lanes of traffic in each direction , with an additional one or two lanes closer to the heart of the city . The modernized freeway now handles on average between 75 @,@ 000 – 125 @,@ 000 vehicles per day , making it the busiest highway in the state of Iowa . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Interstate 235 begins at the western intersection of Interstate 35 and Interstate 80 , known locally as the West Mixmaster . Here , eastbound I @-@ 80 exits the highway , which becomes I @-@ 235 and joins northbound I @-@ 35 . From the West Mixmaster , I @-@ 235 heads east . Almost immediately is a half @-@ diamond interchange with 50th Street in West Des Moines . One mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) later is a partial @-@ cloverleaf interchange with Valley West Drive , which was renamed from 35th Street in 1988 due to its proximity to Valley West Mall and Valley High School . 
 At Windsor Heights at a tight partial @-@ cloverleaf interchange I @-@ 235 meets 73rd Street / 8th Street . The interchange is particularly tight because of an Iowa Interstate Railroad line just to the east . 73rd Street / 8th Street is actually a single road : north of I @-@ 235 , 73rd Street follows the Des Moines street numbering plan , while south of I @-@ 235 , 8th Street follows the older street numbering plan of West Des Moines . 
 At the 63rd Street interchange , I @-@ 235 picks up a fourth lane of eastbound travel and drops a lane westbound . Now within the city limits of Des Moines , it passes the through the heavily wooded Waterbury neighborhood . Near the 42nd Street interchange , I @-@ 235 curves to the south around Theodore Roosevelt High School . One half @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) later is an interchange with 31st Street , which provides access to Drake University to the north , and to Terrace Hill , the governor 's mansion , to the south . 
 East of 31st Street , I @-@ 235 briefly picks up a fifth lane and drops a lane westbound , creating a 10 @-@ lane freeway just west of downtown . This stretch of freeway receives , on average , over 125 @,@ 000 vehicles per day , making it the busiest stretch of road in the state . 
 There are three eastbound interchanges connecting I @-@ 235 to downtown Des Moines . Martin Luther King Jr . Parkway and 19th Street , a pair of one @-@ way streets , lead traffic to the west of downtown . Keosauqua Way , known locally as Keo Way , enters downtown from the northwest . These interchanges are combined westbound . Closer to the Des Moines River , a combined interchange in each direction filters off the rest of downtown traffic to two destinations : Seventh Street and Sixth Avenue , and Third Street and Second Avenue , each of which are pairs of one @-@ way streets . The fourth lane of traffic drops off at this combined interchange . 
 At the Des Moines River , I @-@ 235 passes Wells Fargo Arena , the main Iowa Events Center destination , on the western shore and the Des Moines Botanical Center on the eastern shore . On the eastern side of Des Moines , it passes the East Village , the Iowa State Capitol , and East High School before the interchange with U.S. Route 69 . One mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) east is an interchange with East University Avenue , which , up to now had been relatively parallel to I @-@ 235 . East University provides access to the Iowa State Fairgrounds for northbound I @-@ 35 and eastbound I @-@ 80 traffic . 
 At University Avenue , I @-@ 235 begins curving to the north , dividing an industrial district to the west and residential areas to the east . 1 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) to the north , it intersects East Euclid Avenue at a partial @-@ cloverleaf interchange . It continues north for another 1 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) until it meets Interstate 35 and Interstate 80 again at the East Mixmaster . 
 = = History = = 
 The first section of Interstate 235 to open , from Cottage Grove Avenue to Keo Way , opened on December 14 , 1961 . Over the next seven years , sections of I @-@ 235 opened , spreading east and west toward the <unk> until it was completed on October 30 , 1968 . 
 In October 1963 , the Des Moines city council designated I @-@ 235 the John MacVicar Freeway in honor of two former mayors of Des Moines : John MacVicar , Sr. , ( 1896 – 1900 , 1916 – 1918 , 1928 ) and John MacVicar , Jr . , ( 1942 – 1948 ) . However , this name is seldom used ; most people simply refer to it as I @-@ 235 . 
 In March 2002 , a six @-@ year @-@ long project to completely rebuild I @-@ 235 and the bridges which cross it began . The first two years consisted of rebuilding most of the bridges which cross it , starting with 42nd Street in West Des Moines . The final four years of the project entailed finishing the remaining bridges , widening , regrading , and repaving the entire length of the highway . 
 = = = Pedestrian bridges = = = 
 An additional part of the highway improvement plan were three pedestrian bridges , located at 6th , 40th and 44th Streets . The three bridges were replacements for bridges which were too narrow to accommodate the newly widened highway . These highly visible bridges act as icons , locating the neighborhoods for travelers along the freeway . The design of the I @-@ 235 pedestrian bridges was completed by Boston @-@ based bridge designer Miguel Rosales in collaboration with HNTB Engineering . The three bridges , the Edna M. Griffin Memorial Bridge ( 6th Street ) , the 40th Street Pedestrian Bridge , and the Rider Way Pedestrian Bridge ( 44th Street ) were each completed by 2005 . 
 The new design utilizes basket @-@ handle steel arches with clear spans of approximately 230 feet ( 70 m ) . Inclined cables connect the steel blue arches to the pre @-@ stressed concrete deck . By selecting a tied arch form , the Iowa Department of Transportation was able to keep disruption of traffic to a minimum during construction . An innovative curved screen system is used to enhance security and the appearance of the structure creating a visually appealing experience for pedestrians and bicyclists using the bridge . The resulting series of bridges has created a distinctive form that is unique to the city and the state . The city of Des Moines recently relit the bridges with LED lighting .

 = Church of St Nicholas , Sapareva Banya = 
 The Church of St Nicholas ( Bulgarian : църква „ Свети Никола “ , tsarkva „ Sveti Nikola “ ) is a small medieval Eastern Orthodox church in the southwestern Bulgarian town of Sapareva Banya , which is part of Kyustendil Province . Originally either the property of a local notable or attached to a larger church , it was constructed anytime from the 11th to the 14th century . 
 The church was built using red bricks and white mortar . Architecturally , it is of a simple Byzantine cross @-@ in @-@ square design , with a single nave and apse . The frescoes in the interior are only scarcely preserved . It was reconstructed in 1937 after falling into ruin , and it was listed as a monument of culture of national importance in 1968 . 
 = = History = = 
 Scholars disagree on the possible period of the church 's construction ; assessments range from the 11th – 12th , through the 12th – 13th , to the 13th – 14th century . In an article in the Bulgarian Church Review magazine from 1898 , the local priest <unk> Popov was cited as saying that a stone from the church altar was unearthed during excavations . The priest believed that the stone , which reportedly had the date 1160 inscribed on it , was sent to the National Archaeological Museum in the capital Sofia . 
 Due to its diminutive size , the Church of St Nicholas was probably not constructed as an independent church . A legend links the church to the name of an unidentified local feudal lord named Nikola ( Nicholas ) as his final resting place , though archaeologist Nikola Mavrodinov considers it more likely that it was possibly a chapel or a cemetery church attached to a larger place of worship . The larger church was perhaps pulled down during the early Ottoman rule of Bulgaria ( post @-@ 14th century ) . While the Church of St Nicholas was not destroyed , its renovation was prohibited by the Ottomans , thus it gradually fell into ruin . 
 In his 1931 study , Mavrodinov also writes that at the time , the church lacked a roof . He references a story about a group of Circassians that were settled in Sapareva Banya on the order of the Ottoman authorities after the Crimean War ( 1853 – 1856 ) . According to that story , the Circassians sought to pull down the church 's roof . However , one of them fell to his death inside the church , so they fled in horror . The church was thoroughly reconstructed in 1937 by a team under architect <unk> . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The Church of St Nicholas lies in the centre of Sapareva Banya . Its architecture is rather simple , with a single nave , a single apse and no narthex present . The church follows the Byzantine cross @-@ in @-@ square design , with unusually short arms of equal size . The dome has twelve sides and is of no particular height , though it is rather large for the church 's size . The apse is situated on the church 's eastern side ; its shape is semicircular and it features a window . The entrance is located on the west wall . 
 The church was constructed out of rows of red bricks stuck together with white mortar . According to scholar Bistra Nikolova , its size is 7 @.@ 20 by 5 @.@ 50 metres ( 23 @.@ 6 ft × 18 @.@ 0 ft ) , while another source measures it as 6 @.@ 60 m × 5 @.@ 40 m ( 21 @.@ 7 ft × 17 @.@ 7 ft ) . Either way , it is square in appearance . In height , it probably reached 6 @.@ 60 m ( 21 @.@ 7 ft ) at the dome and 4 @.@ 20 m ( 13 @.@ 8 ft ) at the cornice . 
 In terms of design and decoration , Mavrodinov likens the church to the Church of St Pantaleon in Gorno Nerezi near Skopje , today in the Republic of Macedonia . It is also compared to the Church of St Theodore in nearby <unk> . The Church of St Nicholas features a multitude of two @-@ stepped vaults on its outside walls . The interior was originally entirely covered with frescoes , though only fragments survive . It was enlisted as a monument of culture of national importance in 1968 , with a publication in Bulgaria 's newspaper of record , the State Gazette , issue 77 . 
 = SMS Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm = 
 SMS Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm ( " His Majesty 's Ship Elector Friedrich Wilhelm " ) was one of the first ocean @-@ going battleships of the Imperial German Navy . The ship was named for Prince @-@ elector ( Kurfürst ) Friedrich Wilhelm , 17th @-@ century Duke of Prussia and Margrave of Brandenburg . She was the fourth pre @-@ dreadnought of the Brandenburg class , along with her sister ships Brandenburg , Weissenburg , and Wörth . She was laid down in 1890 in the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven , launched in 1891 , and completed in 1893 at a cost of 11 @.@ 23 million marks . The Brandenburg @-@ class battleships carried six large @-@ caliber guns in three twin turrets , as opposed to four guns in two turrets , as was the standard in other navies . 
 Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm served as the flagship of the Imperial fleet from her commissioning in 1894 until 1900 . She saw limited active duty during her service career with the German fleet due to the relatively peaceful nature of the late 19th and early 20th centuries . As a result , her career focused on training exercises and goodwill visits to foreign ports . These training maneuvers were nevertheless very important to developing German naval tactical doctrine in the two decades before World War I , especially under the direction of Alfred von Tirpitz . She , along with her three sisters , saw only one major overseas deployment , to China in 1900 – 01 , during the Boxer Rebellion . The ship underwent a major modernization in 1904 – 05 . 
 In 1910 , Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm was sold to the Ottoman Empire and renamed Barbaros Hayreddin . She saw heavy service during the Balkan Wars , primarily providing artillery support to Ottoman ground forces in Thrace . She also took part in two naval engagements with the Greek Navy — the Battle of Elli in December 1912 , and the Battle of Lemnos the following month . Both battles were defeats for the Ottoman Navy . In a state of severe disrepair , the old battleship was partially disarmed after the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers early in World War I. On 8 August 1915 the ship was torpedoed and sunk off the Dardanelles by the British submarine HMS E11 with heavy loss of life . 
 = = Description = = 
 Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm was 115 @.@ 7 meters ( 379 ft 7 in ) long overall , had a beam of 19 @.@ 5 m ( 64 ft 0 in ) which was increased to 19 @.@ 74 m ( 64 ft 9 in ) with the addition of torpedo nets , and had a draft of 7 @.@ 6 m ( 24 ft 11 in ) forward and 7 @.@ 9 m ( 25 ft 11 in ) aft . The ship displaced 10 @,@ 013 metric tons ( 9 @,@ 855 long tons ) at its designed weight , and up to 10 @,@ 670 t ( 10 @,@ 500 long tons ) at full combat load . She was equipped with two sets of 3 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion engines that provided 9 @,@ 553 ihp ( 7 @,@ 124 kW ) and had a top speed of 16 @.@ 9 knots ( 31 @.@ 3 km / h ; 19 @.@ 4 mph ) . Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm had a cruising range of 4 @,@ 300 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 000 km ; 4 @,@ 900 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Her crew numbered 38 officers and 530 enlisted men . 
 The ship was unusual for her time in that she possessed a broadside of six heavy guns in three twin gun turrets , rather than the four guns typical of contemporary battleships . The forward and aft turrets carried 28 @-@ centimeter ( 11 in ) K L / 40 guns , and the center turret was armed with shorter L / 35 guns . Her secondary armament consisted of eight 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) SK L / 35 and eight 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) SK L / 30 quick @-@ firing guns mounted in casemates . Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm 's armament suite was rounded out with six 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , all in above @-@ water swivel mounts . Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm was protected with nickel @-@ steel Krupp armor , a new type of stronger steel . Her main belt armor was 400 millimeters ( 15 @.@ 7 in ) thick in the central section that protected the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces . The deck was 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick . The main battery barbettes were protected with 300 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) thick armor .

 Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm was the fourth and final ship of her class . She was ordered as battleship D , and was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft ( Imperial Shipyard ) in Wilhelmshaven in 1890 . She was the first ship of the class to be launched , on 30 June 1891 . The ceremony was attended by Kaiser Wilhelm II and his wife , Augusta Victoria . She was commissioned into the German fleet on 29 April 1894 , the same day as her sister Brandenburg . While on sea trials , the ship suffered from several problems with her propulsion system . She was therefore decommissioned for repairs to the machinery , before being re @-@ commissioned on 1 November 1894 . Construction of Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm cost the German navy 11 @.@ 23 million marks . Upon her commissioning , Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm was assigned to the I Division of the I Battle Squadron alongside her three sisters . She replaced the ironclad Bayern as the Squadron flagship on 16 November , under the command of Vizeadmiral ( Vice Admiral ) Hans von Koester . Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm would remain the flagship for the next six years . The I Division was accompanied by the four older Sachsen @-@ class ironclads in the II Division , though by 1901 – 2 , the Sachsens were replaced by the new Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class battleships . The ship was a training ground for later commanders in chief of the High Seas Fleet , including Admirals Reinhard Scheer and Franz von Hipper , who both served aboard the ship as navigation officers during 1897 and October 1898 to September 1899 , respectively . 
 After entering active service , Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and the rest of the squadron attended ceremonies for the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal at Kiel on 3 December 1894 . The squadron thereafter began a winter training cruise in the Baltic Sea ; this was the first such cruise by the German fleet . In previous years , the bulk of the fleet was deactivated for the winter months . During this voyage , the I Division anchored in Stockholm from 7 to 11 December , during the 300th anniversary of the birth of Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus . King Oscar II held a reception for the visiting German delegation , which included Prince Heinrich , the younger brother of Wilhelm II and the commander of the battleship Wörth . Thereafter , further exercises were conducted in the Baltic before the ships had to put into their home ports for repairs . During this dockyard period , Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm had her funnels extended in height . 
 1895 began with what became the normal trips to Heligoland and then to Bremerhaven , with Wilhelm II on board . This was followed by individual ship and divisional training , which was interrupted by a voyage to the northern North Sea . On this trip , Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm was accompanied by her sister ship Brandenburg ; the two battleships stopped in Lerwick in Shetland from 16 to 23 March . This was the first time units of the main German fleet had left home waters . The purpose of the exercise was to test the ships in heavy weather ; both vessels performed admirably . In May , more fleet maneuvers were carried out in the western Baltic , and they were concluded by a visit of the fleet to Kirkwall in Orkney . The squadron returned to Kiel in early June , where preparations were under way for the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal . Tactical exercises were carried out in Kiel Bay in the presence of foreign delegations to the opening ceremony . 
 On 28 June , an explosion occurred on one of the ship 's pinnaces killing seven crewmen and badly injuring the future Vizeadmiral Wilhelm Starke . Further training exercises lasted until 1 July , when the I Division began a voyage into the Atlantic Ocean . This operation had political motives ; Germany had only been able to send a small contingent of vessels — the protected cruiser Kaiserin Augusta , the coastal defense ship Hagen , and the sailing frigate Stosch — to an international naval demonstration off the Moroccan coast at the same time . The main fleet could therefore provide moral support to the demonstration by steaming to Spanish waters . Rough weather again allowed Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and her sister ships to demonstrate their excellent seakeeping . The fleet departed Vigo and stopped in Queenstown , Ireland . Wilhelm II , aboard his yacht Hohenzollern , attended the Cowes Regatta while the rest of the fleet stayed off the Isle of Wight . 
 On 10 August , the fleet returned to Wilhelmshaven and began preparations for the autumn maneuvers later that month . The first exercises began in the Heligoland Bight on 25 August . The fleet then steamed through the Skagerrak to the Baltic ; heavy storms caused significant damage to many of the ships and the torpedo boat S 41 capsized and sank in the storms — only three men were saved . The fleet stayed briefly in Kiel before resuming exercises , including live @-@ fire exercises , in the Kattegat and the Great Belt . The main maneuvers began on 7 September with a mock attack from Kiel toward the eastern Baltic . Subsequent maneuvers took place off the coast of Pomerania and in Danzig Bay . A fleet review for Wilhelm II off <unk> concluded the maneuvers on 14 September . Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm went into drydock for periodic maintenance on 1 October . The ironclad Baden temporarily replaced her as flagship until the work was completed on 20 October . The rest of the year was spent on individual ship training , with the exception of a short trip to Gothenburg from 5 to 9 November . Only three other ships accompanied Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm on this visit : the ironclads Sachsen and Württemberg and the aviso Pfeil . On 9 December , the squadron commander shifted his flag to Württemberg while Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm went into drydock for an overhaul . 
 = = = = 1896 – 1900 = = = = 
 The year 1896 followed much the same pattern as the previous year . On 10 March 1896 , Koester once again raised his flag aboard Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm . Individual ship training was conducted though April , followed by squadron training in the North Sea in late April and early May . This included a visit to the Dutch ports of Vlissingen and <unk> . Further maneuvers , which lasted from the end of May to the end of July , took the squadron further north in the North Sea , frequently into Norwegian waters . The ships visited Bergen from 11 to 18 May . During the maneuvers , Wilhelm II and the Chinese viceroy Li Hongzhang observed a fleet review off Kiel . On 9 August , the training fleet assembled in Wilhelmshaven for the annual autumn fleet training . Following the conclusion of the maneuvers , Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm again went into dock for maintenance , and while she was out of service , Koester transferred his flag to Sachsen from 16 September to 3 October . Koester again flew his flag aboard Sachsen from 15 December to 1 March 1897 . 
 Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and the rest of the fleet operated under the normal routine of individual and unit training in the first half of 1897 . Early in the year , the naval command considered deploying the I Division , including Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm , to another naval demonstration off Morocco to protest the murder of two German nationals there , but a smaller squadron of sailing frigates was sent instead . The typical routine was interrupted in early August when Wilhelm II and Augusta went to visit the Russian imperial court at Kronstadt ; both divisions of the I Squadron were sent to accompany the Kaiser . They had returned to Neufahrwasser in Danzig on 15 August , where the rest of the fleet joined them for the annual autumn maneuvers . These exercises reflected the tactical thinking of the new State Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt ( RMA — Imperial Navy Office ) , Konteradmiral Alfred von Tirpitz , and the new commander of the I Squadron , Vizeadmiral August von Thomsen . These new tactics stressed accurate gunnery , especially at longer ranges , though the necessities of the line @-@ ahead formation led to a great deal of rigidity in the tactics . Thomsen 's emphasis on shooting created the basis for the excellent German gunnery during World War I. The maneuvers were completed by 22 September in Wilhelmshaven . 
 In early December , the I Division conducted maneuvers in the Kattegat and the Skagerrak , though they were cut short due to shortages in officers and men . The fleet followed the typical routine of individual and fleet training in 1898 without incident , though a voyage to the British Isles was also included . The fleet stopped in Queenstown , Greenock , and Kirkwall . The fleet assembled in Kiel on 14 August for the annual autumn exercises . The maneuvers included a mock blockade of the coast of Mecklenburg and a pitched battle with an " Eastern Fleet " in the Danzig Bay . While steaming back to Kiel , a severe storm hit the fleet , causing significant damage to many ships and sinking the torpedo boat S 58 . The fleet then transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and continued the maneuvers in the North Sea . Training finished on 17 September in Wilhelmshaven . In December , the I Division conducted artillery and torpedo training in Eckernförde Bay , followed by divisional training in the Kattegat and Skagerrak . During these maneuvers , the division visited <unk> , Sweden , from 9 to 13 December . After returning to Kiel , the ships of the I Division went into dock for their winter repairs . 
 On 5 April 1899 , the ship participated in the celebrations commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Eckernförde during the First Schleswig War . In May , the I and II Divisions , along with the Reserve Division from the Baltic , went on a major cruise into the Atlantic . On the voyage out , the I Division stopped in Dover and the II Division went into Falmouth to restock their coal supplies . The I Division then joined the II Division at Falmouth on 8 May , and the two units then departed for the Bay of Biscay , arriving at Lisbon on 12 May . There , they met the British Channel Fleet of eight battleships and four armored cruisers . The Portuguese king , Carlos I came aboard Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm to inspect the German flagship . The German fleet then departed for Germany , stopping again in Dover on 24 May . There , they participated in the naval review celebrating Queen Victoria 's 80th birthday . The fleet returned to Kiel on 31 May . 
 In July , the fleet conducted squadron maneuvers in the North Sea , which included coast defense exercises with soldiers from the X Corps . On 16 August , the fleet assembled in Danzig once again for the annual autumn maneuvers . The exercises started in the Baltic and on 30 August the fleet passed through the Kattegat and Skagerrak and steamed into the North Sea for further maneuvers in the German Bight , which lasted until 7 September . The third phase of the maneuvers took place in the Kattegat and the Great Belt from 8 to 26 September , when the maneuvers concluded and the fleet went into port for annual maintenance . The year 1900 began with the usual routine of individual and divisional exercises . In the second half of March , the squadrons met in Kiel , followed by torpedo and gunnery practice in April and a voyage to the eastern Baltic . From 7 to 26 May , the fleet went on a major training cruise to the northern North Sea , which included stops in the Shetlands from 12 to 15 May and in Bergen from 18 to 22 May . On 8 July , the ships of the I Division were reassigned to the II Division , and the role of fleet flagship was transferred to the recently commissioned battleship Kaiser Wilhelm II . 
 = = = = Boxer Rebellion = = = = 
 Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm saw her first major operation in 1900 , when the I Division was deployed to China during the Boxer Rebellion . Chinese nationalists laid siege to the foreign embassies in Peking and murdered the German minister . At the time , the German East Asia Squadron consisted of the protected cruisers Kaiserin Augusta , Hansa , Hertha , the small cruisers Irene , Gefion , and the gunboats Jaguar and Iltis , but the Kaiser decided that an expeditionary force was necessary to reinforce the Eight Nation Alliance that had formed to defeat the Boxers . The expeditionary force consisted of Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and her three sisters , six cruisers , 10 freighters , three torpedo boats , and six regiments of marines , under the command of Marshal Alfred von Waldersee . Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm served as the flagship of Konteradmiral Richard von Geißler , who took command on 6 July . 
 On 7 July , Geißler reported that his ships were ready for the operation , and they left two days later . The four battleships and the aviso Hela transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and stopped in Wilhelmshaven to rendezvous with the rest of the expeditionary force . On 11 July , the force steamed out of the Jade Bight , bound for China . They stopped to coal at Gibraltar on 17 – 18 July and they passed through the Suez Canal on 26 – 27 July . More coal was taken on at Perim in the Red Sea , and on 2 August , the fleet entered the Indian Ocean . On 10 August , the ships reached Colombo , Ceylon , and on 14 August they passed through the Strait of Malacca . They arrived in Singapore on 18 August and departed five days later , reaching Hong Kong on 28 August . Two days later , the expeditionary force stopped in the outer roadstead at Wusong , downriver from Shanghai . From there , Wörth was detached to cover the disembarkation of the German expeditionary corps outside the Taku Forts , while Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and her other two sister ships joined the blockade of the Yangtze River , which also included a British contingent of two battleships , three cruisers , four gunboats , and one destroyer . A small Chinese fleet stationed upriver did not even clear their ships for action , owing to the strength of the Anglo @-@ German fleet . 
 By the time the German fleet had arrived , the siege of Peking had already been lifted by forces from other members of the Eight @-@ Nation Alliance that had formed to deal with the Boxers . In early September , Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and the rest of the German fleet was moved to the Yellow Sea , where Waldersee , who had been given command of all ground forces of the Eight @-@ Nation Alliance , planned stronger actions against the harbors of northern China . On 3 – 4 September , the flagship of the East Asia Squadron , Fürst Bismarck reconnoitered the harbors of Shanhaiguan and <unk> . Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm then went to Shanhaiguan and sent a landing party of 100 men ashore while her torpedo crew cleared the Chinese minefields . She then returned to the Wusong roads while the ships of the East Asia Squadron remained off both ports . Since the situation had calmed , Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and her sisters were sent to Hong Kong or Nagasaki , Japan in early 1901 for overhauls ; Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm went to Nagasaki from 4 to 23 January . In March , the expeditionary fleet reassembled in Tsingtau for gunnery and tactical exercises . 
 On 26 May , the German high command recalled the expeditionary force to Germany . The fleet took on supplies in Shanghai and departed Chinese waters on 1 June . The fleet stopped in Singapore from 10 to 15 June and took on coal before proceeding to Colombo , where they stayed from 22 to 26 June . Steaming against the monsoons forced the fleet to stop in Mahé , Seychelles to take on more coal . The fleet then stopped for a day each to take on coal in Aden and Port Said . On 1 August they reached Cádiz , and then met with the I Division and steamed back to Germany together . They separated after reaching Heligoland , and on 11 August after reaching the Jade roadstead , the ships of the expeditionary force were visited by Admiral von Koester , who was now the Inspector General of the Navy . The following day , Geißler lowered his flag aboard Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and the expeditionary fleet was dissolved . In the end , the operation cost the German government more than 100 million marks .

 Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm went to Kiel after returning from the expedition to China , where on 14 August Konteradmiral Fischel raised his flag aboard the ship . She was assigned to the I Squadron as the second command flagship for the annual autumn maneuvers . These exercises were interrupted by the visit from Nicholas II of Russia , who came aboard Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm . After the maneuvers , Fischel was replaced by Konteradmiral Curt von <unk> und Gaffron on 24 October . In late 1901 , the fleet went on a cruise to Norway , during which Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm stopped in Oslo . During the months of December , January , and February , the ship was in drydock for major repair work . 
 The pattern of training for 1902 remained unchanged from previous years ; I Squadron went on a major training cruise that started on 25 April . The squadron initially steamed to Norwegian waters , then rounded the northern tip of Scotland , and stopped in Irish waters . The ships returned to Kiel on 28 May . Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm then participated in the annual autumn maneuvers , after which she was decommissioned , with the new battleship Wittelsbach taking her place as second command flagship . The four Brandenburg class battleships were taken out of service for a major reconstruction . The work to Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm was done at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Wilhelmshaven . The work included increasing the ship 's coal storage capacity and adding a pair of 10 @.@ 5 cm guns . The plans had initially called for the center 28 cm turret to be replaced with an armored battery of medium @-@ caliber guns , but this proved to be prohibitively expensive . Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm was the last ship of her class to complete her reconstruction , which was finished on 14 December 1905 . 
 On 1 January 1906 she was assigned to the II Squadron and served as the flagship of first Konteradmiral Henning von Holtzendorff , and then during the autumn maneuvers of Konteradmiral Adolf <unk> . The fleet conducted its normal routine of individual and unit training , interrupted only by a cruise to Norway from mid @-@ July to early August . The annual autumn maneuvers occurred as usual . Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm served as the second command flagship in the I Squadron of the newly created High Seas Fleet , but at the end of the 1906 training year , she was removed from active duty and her place was taken by the new battleship Pommern . 
 Beginning on 1 October 1907 , Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm was assigned to the Reserve Squadron in the North Sea , which had been created in early 1907 to train new crews . Her three sister ships joined her in this unit ; their duties typically consisted of training cruises in the North Sea . From 5 to 25 April , she operated with the Training Squadron with its flagship Vineta . In September , the Reserve Squadron contributed vessels to the autumn maneuvers ; Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm served as the Reserve Squadron flagship , with the coastal defense ships Ägir and Frithjof , the minelaying cruisers Nautilus and Albatross , and the old avisos Blitz , Pfeil , and Zieten . The Squadron was organized in Cuxhaven and joined the High Seas Fleet in the German Bight on 8 September . They participated in the main series of exercises off Heligoland , and the squadron was dissolved when the maneuvers ended on 12 September . 
 After completing her annual winter overhaul , Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm returned to the Reserve Squadron in January 1909 . Starting on 27 March , she operated with the Training Squadron again , the flagship of which was now the armored cruiser Friedrich Carl . Between 30 March and 24 April , she cruised in the central Baltic and in the waters around Rügen . She and the rest of the Reserve Squadron joined the autumn maneuvers in August and the battleship Schwaben replaced Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm as the flagship of the Reserve Squadron . Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm was then transferred to the VII Division in the Reserve Squadron . She continued in this routine in early 1910 ; she operated with the Training Squadron from 4 to 29 April and cruised in the Skagerrak and the western Baltic . The battleship was scheduled to take part in the autumn maneuvers , but shortly before the fleet assembled for the exercises , both she and Weissenburg were sold to the Ottoman Empire . 
 = = = In Ottoman service = = = 
 In late 1909 , the German military attache to the Ottoman Empire began a conversation with the Ottoman Navy about the possibility of selling German warships to the Ottomans to counter Greek naval expansion . After lengthy negotiations , including Ottoman attempts to buy one or more of the new battlecruisers Von der Tann , Moltke , and Goeben , the Germans offered to sell the four ships of the Brandenburg class at a cost of 10 million marks . The Ottomans chose to buy Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and Weissenburg , since they were the more advanced ships of the class . The two battleships were renamed after the famous 16th @-@ century Ottoman admirals , Hayreddin Barbarossa and Turgut Reis . They were transferred on 1 September 1910 , and German crews took the ships to Constantinople , along with four new destroyers also purchased from Germany . The Ottoman navy , however , had great difficulty equipping the Barbaros Hayreddin and Turgut Reis ; the navy had to pull trained enlisted men from the rest of the fleet just to put together crews for them . Both vessels suffered from condenser troubles after they entered Ottoman service , which reduced their speed to 8 to 10 knots ( 15 to 19 km / h ; 9 to 12 mph ) . 
 A year later , in September 1911 , Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire . The two battleships and the ancient central battery ironclad Mesûdiye — which had been built in the mid @-@ 1870s — had been on a summer training cruise since July , and so were prepared for the conflict . On 1 October , shortly after the outbreak of war , Barbaros Hayreddin and the rest of the Ottoman fleet was moored at Beirut . The following day , the fleet departed for Constantinople for repairs in preparation to engage the Italian fleet . Nevertheless , the bulk of the Ottoman fleet , including Barbaros Hayreddin , remained in port for the duration of the war . By the end of the war , Barbaros Hayreddin and her sister were in very poor condition . Their rangefinders and the ammunition hoists for their main battery guns had been removed , their telephones did not work , and the pipes for their pumps were badly rusted . Most of the watertight doors could not close , and the condensers remained problematic . 
 = = = = Balkan Wars = = = = 
 The First Balkan War broke out in October 1912 , when the Balkan League attacked the Ottoman Empire . The condition of Barbaros Hayreddin , as with most ships of the Ottoman fleet , had deteriorated significantly . During the war , Barbaros Hayreddin conducted gunnery training along with the other capital ships of the Ottoman navy , escorted troop convoys , and bombarded coastal installations . On 17 October , Barbaros Hayreddin and Turgut Reis steamed to <unk> . Two days later , the two battleships bombarded Bulgarian artillery positions near Varna . On 30 October , Barbaros Hayreddin was back outside Varna to blockade the port along with the destroyer <unk> @-@ i Hamiyet . On 17 November , Barbaros Hayreddin and Mesûdiye bombarded Bulgarian positions in support of the I Corps , with the aid of artillery observers ashore . The battleships ' gunnery was poor , though it provided a morale boost for the defending Ottoman army dug in at Çatalca . From 15 to 20 November , the ship was stationed at Büyükçekmece along with her sister ship and several other warships , but they saw no action against the small Bulgarian navy . 
 In December 1912 , the Ottoman fleet was reorganized into an armored division , which included Barbaros Hayreddin as flagship , two destroyer divisions , and a fourth division composed of warships intended for independent operations . Over the next two months , the armored division attempted to break the Greek naval blockade of the Dardanelles , which resulted in two major naval engagements . 
 = = = = = Battle of Elli = = = = = 
 At the Battle of Elli on 16 December 1912 , the Ottomans attempted to launch an attack on Imbros . The Ottoman fleet sortied from the Dardanelles at 9 : 30 ; the smaller craft remained at the mouth of the straits while the battleships sailed north , hugging the coast . The Greek flotilla , which included the armored cruiser Georgios Averof and three Hydra @-@ class ironclads , sailing from the island of Lemnos , altered course to the northeast to block the advance of the Ottoman battleships . The Ottoman ships opened fire on the Greeks at 9 : 40 , from a range of about 15 @,@ 000 yd ( 14 @,@ 000 m ) . Five minutes later , Georgios Averof crossed over to the other side of the Ottoman fleet , placing the Ottomans in the unfavorable position of being under fire from both sides . At 9 : 50 and under heavy pressure from the Greek fleet , the Ottoman ships completed a 16 @-@ point turn , which reversed their course , and headed for the safety of the straits . The turn was poorly conducted , and the ships fell out of formation , blocking each other 's fields of fire . 
 By 10 : 17 , both sides had ceased firing and the Ottoman fleet withdrew into the Dardanelles . The ships reached port by 13 : 00 and transferred their casualties to the hospital ship Resit Paşa . The battle was considered a Greek victory , because the Ottoman fleet remained blockaded . During the battle , Barbaros Hayreddin was hit twice . The first shell struck the <unk> and killed five men assigned to a damage control party . The second shell jammed the rear turret , placing it out of action . Shell fragments from this hit damaged several boilers and caused a fire in one of the coal bunkers . 
 On 4 January 1913 , the Ottoman Navy and Army attempted a landing at <unk> Ada ( Tenedos ) to retake the island from the Greeks . Barbaros Hayreddin and the rest of the fleet supported the operation , but the appearance of the Greek fleet forced the Ottomans to break off the operation . The Greeks also withdrew , and several Ottoman cruisers opened fire as both sides departed , but no damage was done . By 15 : 30 , Barbaros Hayreddin was back at Çanakkale inside the safety of the Dardanelles . On 10 January , the fleet conducted a patrol outside the Dardanelles . They encountered several Greek destroyers and forced them to withdraw , but inflicted no damage on the Greek ships . 
 = = = = = Battle of Lemnos = = = = = 
 The Battle of Lemnos resulted from an Ottoman plan to lure the faster Georgios Averof away from the Dardanelles . The protected cruiser Hamidiye evaded the Greek blockade and broke out into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to draw the Greek cruiser into pursuit . Despite the threat posed by the cruiser , the Greek commander refused to detach Georgios Averof . By mid @-@ January , however , the Ottomans had learned that Georgios Averof remained with the Greek fleet , and so <unk> <unk> ( Captain ) Ramiz Numan Bey , the Ottoman fleet commander , decided to attack the Greeks regardless . 
 Barbaros Hayreddin , Turgut Reis , and other units of the Ottoman fleet departed the Dardanelles at 8 : 20 on the morning of 18 January , and sailed toward the island of Lemnos at a speed of 11 knots ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) . Barbaros Hayreddin led the line of battleships , with a flotilla of torpedo boats on either side of the formation . Georgios Averof , with the three Hydra @-@ class ironclads and five destroyers trailing behind , intercepted the Ottoman fleet approximately 12 nautical miles ( 22 km ; 14 mi ) from Lemnos . At 10 : 55 , the Ottoman cruiser Mecidiye spotted the Greeks , and the fleet turned south to engage them . 
 A long range artillery duel that lasted for two hours began at around 11 : 55 , when the Ottoman fleet opened fire at a range of 8 @,@ 000 m ( 26 @,@ 000 ft ) . They concentrated their fire on the Greek Georgios Averof , which returned fire at 12 : 00 . At 12 : 50 , the Greeks attempted to cross the T of the Ottoman fleet , but Barbaros Hayreddin turned north to block the Greek maneuver . The Ottoman commander detached the old battleship Mesudiye after a serious hit at 12 : 55 . At around the same time , a shell hit Barbaros Hayreddin on her amidships turret , killing the entire gun crew . She was thereafter hit several times in the superstructure ; these hits did relatively little damage , but they created significant smoke that was sucked into the boiler rooms and caused the ship 's speed to fall to 5 knots ( 9 @.@ 3 km / h ; 5 @.@ 8 mph ) . As a result , Turgut Reis took the lead of the formation and Bey decided to break off the engagement . 
 Toward the end of the engagement , Georgios Averof closed to within 5 @,@ 000 yd ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) and scored several hits on the fleeing Ottoman ships . At 14 : 00 , the Ottoman warships had come close enough to the shore to be protected by coastal batteries , forcing the Greeks to withdraw and ending the battle . During the battle , both Barbaros Hayreddin and her sister had a barbette disabled by gunfire , and both caught fire as a result . Between Barbaros Hayreddin and Turgut Reis , the ships fired some 800 rounds , mostly of their main battery 28 cm ( 11 in ) ammunition but without success . 
 = = = = = Subsequent operations = = = = = 
 On 8 February 1913 , the Ottoman navy supported an amphibious assault at Şarköy . Barbaros Hayreddin and Turgut Reis , along with several cruisers weighed anchor at 5 : 50 and arrived off the island at around 9 : 00 . The Ottoman fleet provided artillery support , from about a kilometer off shore . The ships supported the left flank of the Ottoman army once it was ashore . The Bulgarian army provided stiff resistance that ultimately forced the Ottoman army to withdraw , though the withdrawal was successful in large part due to the gunfire support from Barbaros Hayreddin and the rest of the fleet . During the battle , Barbaros Hayreddin fired 250 rounds from her 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns and 180 shells from her 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) guns . 
 In March 1913 , the ship returned to the Black Sea to resume support of the Çatalca garrison , which was under renewed attacks by the Bulgarian army . On 26 March , the 28 cm ( 11 in ) and 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) shells fired by Barbaros Hayreddin and Turgut Reis helped to turn back the advance of the 2nd Brigade of the Bulgarian 1st Infantry Division . On 30 March , the left wing of the Ottoman line turned to pursue the retreating Bulgarians . Their advance was supported by both field artillery and the heavy guns of Barbaros Hayreddin ; the assault gained the Ottomans about 1 @,@ 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 yd ) by nightfall . In response , the Bulgarians brought the 1st Brigade to the front , which beat the Ottoman advance back to its starting position . 
 = = = = World War I = = = = 
 In the summer of 1914 , World War I broke out in Europe , though the Ottomans initially remained neutral . On 3 August 1914 , Barbaros Hayreddin began a refit at Constantinople — German engineers inspected her and other Ottoman warships in the dockyard and found them to be in a state of severe disrepair . Owing to the state of tension , repairs could not be effected , and only ammunition , coal , and other supplies were loaded . By early November , the actions of the German battlecruiser Goeben , which had been transferred to the Ottoman Navy , resulted in declarations of war by Russia , France , and Great Britain . Between 1914 – 15 , some of the ship 's guns were removed and employed as coastal guns to shore up the defenses protecting the Dardanelles . In the meantime , she was used as a floating artillery battery at the Nara naval base , along with her sister Turgut Reis . Early during this stint , the ships were immobilized , but as the threat from British submarines grew , steam was kept up in their boilers to allow them to move quickly . 
 Barbaros Hayreddin returned to Constantinople on 11 March 1915 ; the Ottoman high command had decided that both ships were not needed at all times . Over the next several months , the two ships alternated trips to Constantinople . On 25 April , the two battleships bombarded the British landings on the first day of the Gallipoli Campaign . After firing fourteen shells , the fifteenth detonated in the right gun barrel in the center turret , destroying the gun . After a shell exploded inside one of Turgut Reis 's guns in early June , both battleships were withdrawn . On 7 August , the British landed more troops at Suvla Bay , prompting the high command to send Barbaros Hayreddin to support the Ottoman defenses there . In addition , she was loaded with a large quantity of ammunition to resupply the Fifth Army fighting in the Gallipoli Campaign . The next day , while she was en route to the area with only a single torpedo boat as escort , she was intercepted by the British submarine HMS E11 off <unk> in the Sea of Marmara . The submarine hit Barbaros Hayreddin with a single torpedo ; she capsized seven minutes later , but remained afloat for a few minutes before she slipped below the waves . The ship sank with the loss of 21 officers and 237 men . The rest of the crew were picked up by her escort and a second torpedo boat patrolling the area .

 In August 2011 , it first was revealed that Lady Gaga would make a guest appearance on the show as herself . Producer James L. Brooks viewed Gaga 's interview with Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes , which prompted Al Jean to write a script and send her a letter of approval to appear on the show . " She was really excited about the whole thing , " Jean recalled . " After she signed on to do it , she came in to record dialogue twice , and we showed her a rough cut the second time . " Recording sessions for the episode took place in Los Angeles during a period of four days from August 22 – 26 . Gaga was initially apprehensive while recording on set , which led her to review the satirical nature of the show to get a better understanding on how to perform . " Their characters are so awesomely convincing and sincere and wild and funny , I had to remind myself constantly of the sincerity of the humor , " she explained . " That 's what I was trying to focus on — not putting on a character too much , and really being as sincere as I could with the lines . " Despite such emotions , Gaga professed that working with the staff of the show was " one of the coolest things that [ she ] has ever done " . 
 Several employees of The Simpsons were impressed with Gaga 's performance , who cited that her vocal range and ad @-@ libbing skills were exceptional . Series creator Matt Groening stated : " Since the very beginning , I ’ ve always wanted to have on the most iconic personalities of our time , and she 's it . " In an interview with E ! Online , Groening further commented on Gaga 's appearance ; " The great thing about having Lady Gaga is that she came in a number of times and always with a different getup . Like she 'd leave the room and come back in after a break in a completely new getup . It was unbelievable . The only time that she ever took off her hat was when it was banging into the microphone . " Cast member Yeardley Smith said that she was shocked that Gaga had the time to make an appearance on the series . 
 The design team for the series conceived eighteen outfits to compliment Gaga 's outré and eccentric reputation , although they did not collaborate with any of Gaga 's stylists or creative director Nicola Formichetti . Due to the outfits ' unconventional appearances , Jean was given more freedom to animate the large array of costumes , as these rapid changes " wouldn 't be possible in real life " . " There 's a moment in the episode , " Jean resumed , " when she starts out with her hair down . Then , there 's a curtain pulled in front of her , and in seconds , she has a completely different outfit on with a cone bra and her hair is all <unk> up and big and frizzy . In real life , that would probably take 8 hours . " Many of the costumes were inspired from previous outfits Gaga had worn , including her meat dress and her Kermit the Frog dress . " We did a lot of research , looking back at her old outfits , and she 's really been in a million different things , had a million different looks . " 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Many aspects of Gaga 's career are referenced in the episode . " You 're All My Little Monsters " , a musical number specifically created for the episode , is a parody of Gaga 's relationship with her devout " Little Monsters " — a phrase Gaga uses to refer to her fans . To Spin columnist Devon Maloney , the song was ultimately an overtly <unk> version of her single " Born This Way " ( 2011 ) that embraces the " freakiness " of Springfield . Several of Gaga 's outfits and looks emulate several iconic costumes the singer had previously worn , such as the " Living Dress " and pyrotechnic leotard she wore during her endeavors on The Monster Ball Tour , as well as her wardrobe at the 53rd Grammy Awards . One in particular , a dress consisting of pork chops , is a parody of the singer 's meat dress , which she wore at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards . During the credits of " Lisa Goes Gaga " , main character Homer Simpson performs a rendition of " Poker Face " ( 2009 ) . At the end of the episode , a title card promotes the Maggie @-@ starring short film The Longest Daycare , which showed before the animated film Ice Age : Continental Drift ( 2012 ) .

 = SMS Brandenburg = 
 SMS Brandenburg was the lead ship of the Brandenburg @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships , which included Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm , Weissenburg , and Wörth built for the German Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) in the early 1890s . She was the first pre @-@ dreadnought built for the German Navy ; earlier , the Navy had only built coastal defense ships and armored frigates . The ship was laid down at the AG Vulcan dockyard in 1890 , launched on 21 September 1891 , and commissioned into the German Navy on 19 November 1893 . Brandenburg and her three sisters were unique for their time in that they carried six heavy guns instead of the four that were standard in other navies . She was named after the Province of Brandenburg . 
 Brandenburg saw her first major deployment in 1900 , when she and her three sister ships were deployed to China to suppress the Boxer Rebellion . Upon returning to Germany , Brandenburg and her sisters , with the exception of Wörth , took part in extensive fleet maneuvers in 1902 . In the early 1900s , all four ships were heavily rebuilt . However , she was obsolete by the start of World War I , and only served in a limited capacity , initially as a coastal defense ship , but primarily as a barracks ship . Following the end of the war , Brandenburg was scrapped in Danzig in 1920 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Brandenburg was 115 @.@ 7 m ( 379 ft 7 in ) long , with a beam of 19 @.@ 5 m ( 64 ft 0 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 6 m ( 24 ft 11 in ) . Brandenburg displaced 10 @,@ 013 t ( 9 @,@ 855 long tons ) as designed , and up to 10 @,@ 670 t ( 10 @,@ 501 long tons ) at full combat load . She was equipped with two sets of 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines that produced 10 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 7 @,@ 457 kW ) and a top speed of 16 @.@ 9 knots ( 31 @.@ 3 km / h ; 19 @.@ 4 mph ) on trials . Steam was provided by twelve transverse cylindrical water @-@ tube boilers . She had a maximum range of 4 @,@ 300 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 000 km ; 4 @,@ 900 mi ) at a cruising speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Her crew numbered 38 officers and 530 enlisted men . 
 Brandenburg was armed with a main battery of six 28 cm ( 11 in ) guns of two types . The forward and rear turret guns were 40 calibers long , while the amidships guns were only 35 calibers ; this was necessary to allow them to train to either side of the ship . Her secondary armament initially consisted of seven 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns , though an additional gun was added during the modernization in 1901 . She also carried eight 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 45 in ) guns and six 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . The ship was protected with compound armor . Her main belt armor was 400 millimeters ( 15 @.@ 7 in ) thick in the central section that protected the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces . The deck was 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick . The main battery barbettes were protected with 300 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) thick armor .

 Brandenburg was ordered as battleship A , the first ship of her class . She was laid down at Germaniawerft in Kiel in 1890 . Her hull was completed by September 1891 and launched on 21 September . Fitting out work followed and was finished by later 1893 ; the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 19 November 1893 , less than four weeks after her sister Wörth , the first vessel in the class to join the fleet . 
 On 16 February 1894 , several steam pipes exploded in the ship . The door between the two engine rooms was open , which allowed the steam to enter both of them . Thirty @-@ nine men were killed in the blast and nine were severely injured . Of these , six later died from their injuries . In June 1895 , the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal was completed ; to celebrate , dozens of warships from 14 different countries gathered in Kiel for a celebration hosted by Kaiser Wilhelm II , including Brandenburg and her three sisters . 
 = = = Boxer Rebellion = = = 
 During the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 , Chinese nationalists laid siege to the foreign embassies in Peking and murdered Baron Clemens von Ketteler , the German minister . The widespread violence against Westerners in China led to a creation of an alliance between Germany and seven other Great Powers : the United Kingdom , Italy , Russia , Austria @-@ Hungary , the United States , France , and Japan . Those soldiers who were in China at the time were too few in number to defeat the Boxers ; in Peking there was a force of slightly more than 400 officers and infantry from the armies of the eight European powers . At the time , the primary German military force in China was the East Asia Squadron , which consisted of the protected cruisers Kaiserin Augusta , Hansa , and Hertha , the small cruisers Irene and Gefion , and the gunboats Jaguar and Iltis . Like many other foreign ships , the German squadron was anchored off the Chinese Taku Forts , which guarded access to Peking . 
 To relieve the foreign legations , British Admiral Edward Seymour mounted a multinational force of 2 @,@ 100 men that disembarked and marched toward the Chinese capital . That force included a German 500 @-@ man detachment dispatched from the fleet anchored off the Taku Forts . Due to heavy resistance , however , the Seymour Expedition could not reach Peking and was forced to retreat toward Tientsin . As a result , the Kaiser determined an expeditionary force would be sent to China to reinforce the East Asia Squadron . Hela was part of the naval expedition , which included the four Brandenburg @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships , sent to China to reinforce the German flotilla there . Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz opposed the plan , which he saw as unnecessary and costly . The force was sent in spite of von Tirpitz 's objections ; it arrived in China in September 1900 . By that time , the siege of Peking had already been lifted . As a result , the task force suppressed local uprisings around the German concession of Kiaochow . In the end , the operation cost the German government more than 100 million marks . The force returned to Germany the following year , in 1901 . 
 = = = Fleet training , 1902 = = = 
 On 31 August 1902 , the annual fleet maneuvers began . The first portion of the exercise positioned Germany in a naval war against a powerful enemy that had superior forces in the North and Baltic Seas . A German squadron , consisting of the coastal defense ships Hagen , Heimdall , and Hildebrand and a division of torpedo boats were trapped in the Kattegat by a superior enemy unit in the North Sea . The " German " squadron was tasked with returning to Kiel in the Baltic , where it would return to Wilhelmshaven via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to rejoin the rest of the fleet . Brandenburg , along with Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and Weissenburg and the cruisers Nymphe , Amazone , and Hela , was positioned in one of the three main channels from the Kattegat to Kiel to act as an opposing force . Two other battle squadrons were positioned to block the advance of the isolated " German " squadron . 
 On the morning of 2 September , the operation commenced . At 06 : 00 that morning , the commander of the " German " squadron decided to take his ships through the channel to which Brandenburg was assigned . The " hostile " torpedo @-@ boat screen sighted the German flotilla , but a dense fog precluded effective pursuit by the battleships . The fog was so thick that Brandenburg and her two sisters had to drop anchor to avoid any unnecessary risks . Later that evening , the three " opponent " forces rendezvoused to pursue the " German " ships . However , the cruiser and the torpedo boat screen was detached to engage the " German " torpedo @-@ boat screen . The lighter ships quickly " destroyed " several of the " German " torpedo boats . This prompted the " German " squadron to retreat northward with the cruisers in pursuit . The German squadron was chased back through the Kattegat before the exercise was called off . On the night of 3 September , the entire fleet anchored off Læsø island to give the crews a rest . 
 The following day , 4 September , the exercise resumed . The German squadron was reinforced by several battleships and the armored cruiser Prinz Heinrich . The German flotilla was ordered to sail into the North Sea and attempt to reach the safety of the island fortress of Helgoland . A short engagement between the hostile screen and Prinz Heinrich ensued , during which Prinz Heinrich damaged the protected cruisers Freya and Victoria Louise . A torpedo boat attack on the German squadron followed in the early hours of 5 September . The hostile force was unable to prevent the escape of the German squadron , however , which reached Helgoland by 12 : 00 . 
 The fleet anchored off Helgoland on 8 – 11 September . During the day the ships conducted training with steam tactics . On 11 September the ships returned to Wilhelmshaven where on the following two days the ships replenished their coal supplies . On 14 September the final operation of the annual maneuvers began . The situation specified that the naval war had gone badly for Germany ; only four battleships , including Brandenburg , Baden , Beowulf , and Württemberg , were still in service . This motley force was augmented by a pair of cruisers and a division of torpedo boats . The ships were to be stationed in the mouth of the Elbe river to protect the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and access to Hamburg . On 15 September , the " hostile " force blockaded the Elbe , along with other rivers and harbors on the North Sea . The hostile battleship squadron steamed to the mouth of the Elbe , where Hela , Freya , and the remaining torpedo boats were stationed as lookouts . Nothing happened during the day of 16 September , but that night several German torpedo boats managed to destroy one of the blockading cruisers and badly damage another . The weather began to storm so the operation was postponed until the following day . That morning , the hostile fleet forced its way into the Elbe , past the fortifications at the mouth of the river . The German flotilla made a desperate attack which resulted in the sinking of two of the hostile battleships . The hostile force , however , ultimately overwhelmed the outnumbered German ships and the exercise ended with their victory . 
 = = = Reconstruction and later service = = = 
 In the early 1900s , the four Brandenburgs were taken into the drydocks at the Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven for major reconstruction . Wörth was the first vessel of the class to enter drydock in 1901 ; Brandenburg didn 't follow until 1903 . During the modernization , a second conning tower was added in the aft superstructure , along with a gangway . Brandenburg and the other ships had their boilers replaced with newer models , and also had the hamper amidships reduced . 
 After emerging from the dry dock after modernization , Brandenburg and the other battleships of her class were assigned to the II Battle Squadron of the fleet and replaced the old Siegfried @-@ class coastal defense ships and the armored frigates Baden and Württemberg . The Deutschland @-@ class battleships , which began to enter service in 1906 , replaced Brandenburg and her three sister @-@ ships in the battle fleet . Brandenburg and Wörth were put into reserve , joining the Siegfried @-@ class ships . Brandenburg 's other sisters , Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and Weissenburg , were sold to the Ottoman Empire in 1910 . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 At the outbreak of World War I , Brandenburg was brought out from the " moth ball cemetery " and recommissioned into the fleet . She served with her sister Wörth , but due to the age of the ships , this lasted only until 1915 . They were then withdrawn from active service . That year , both ships were put into service as barracks ships ; Wörth was stationed in Danzig while Brandenburg was placed in Libau . Both Wörth and Brandenburg were struck from the naval register on 13 May 1919 and sold for scrapping . The two ships were purchased by Norddeutsche Tiefbauges , a shipbreaking firm headquartered in Berlin . Wörth was then broken up for scrap in Danzig . 
 = Prionomyrmex = 
 Prionomyrmex is an extinct genus of bulldog ants in the subfamily Myrmeciinae of the family Formicidae . It was first described by Gustav Mayr in 1868 , after he collected a holotype worker of P. longiceps in Baltic amber . Three species are currently described , characterised by their long mandibles , slender bodies and large size . These ants are known from the Eocene and Late Oligocene , with fossil specimens only found around Europe . It is suggested that these ants preferred to live in jungles , with one species assumed to be an arboreal nesting species . These ants had a powerful stinger that was used to subdue prey . In 2000 , it was suggested by Cesare Baroni Urbani that the living species Nothomyrmecia macrops and a species he described both belonged to Prionomyrmex , but this proposal has not been widely accepted by the entomological community . Instead , scientists still classify the two genera distinctive from each other , making Nothomyrmecia a valid genus . 
 = = Discovery and classification = = 
 The holotype worker for P. longiceps was collected by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1868 . The fossil , which was preserved in Baltic amber from the Eocene , was formally described in Mayr 's journal article Die <unk> des <unk> <unk> , designating it as the type species by <unk> ( the condition of a taxonomic group having only a single taxon described ) for the newly established genus Prionomyrmex . Originally , the genus was placed in the subfamily Ponerinae by Mayr , but in 1877 , Italian entomologist Carlo Emery classified the genus into the subfamily <unk> ( now known as Myrmeciinae ) , the same year Emery established the subfamily . In 1915 , the tribe Prionomyrmecini was erected by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler , who had placed Prionomyrmex in it . In that year , Wheeler placed the genus back into Ponerinae without any means of justifying his decision . British myrmecologist Horace Donisthorpe would also retain the genus in Ponerinae without explanation , but William Brown Jr. would return it to Myrmeciinae in 1954 . 
 In 2000 , Baroni Urbani described a new Baltic fossil species , of which he named it Prionomyrmex janzeni . After examining specimens of the new species and Nothomyrmecia macrops , Baroni Urbani stated that the newly described species and Nothomyrmecia macrops belong to the same genus ( Prionomyrmex ) , in which he synonymised Nothomyrmecia as a genus and treated the tribe Prionomyrmecini as a subfamily , known as <unk> . Prior to this , John S. Clark , the original author who described Nothomyrmecia , noted that the genus was similar in appearance to Prionomyrmex ; both the heads and mandibles were identical , but the nodes were different . As the mandibles of Prionomyrmex are similar to that of Nothomyrmecia , this suggests that they are intermediate to each other . This classification was short @-@ lived , as Nothomyrmecia was separated and treated as a valid genus from Prionomyrmex by Dlussky & Perfilieva in 2003 , on the base of the fusion of an abdominal segment . Other studies published in the same year came to the same conclusions of Dlussky & Perfilieva , and the subfamily <unk> would later be treated as a tribe in Myrmeciinae . However , Baroni Urbani would treat the tribe as a subfamily again in both his 2005 and 2008 publications , suggesting additional evidence in favor of his former interpretation as opposed to that of Ward and Brady 's arguments . In 2012 , P. wappleri was described by Gennady M. Dlussky , based on a fossilised worker from the Late Oligocene , Aquitanian stage . This subsequent report that described new fossil myrmecines accepted the classification of Archibald et al. and Ward & Brady without comment on the views of Baroni Urbani . 
 The generic name is a combination of two words ; <unk> derives from Greek word <unk> , meaning " a saw " , and myrmex , another Greek word , means " ant " . 
 The following cladogram generated by Archibald and colleagues shows the possible phylogenetic position of Prionomyrmex among some ants of the subfamily Myrmeciinae ; note that P. wappleri is absent , as the generated cladogram below was created in 2006 while the species itself was described in 2012 . 
 = = Description = = 
 The genus is characterised by large , slender workers with elongated mandibles , which are narrow and triangular in shape . The mesosoma and appendages are also long . These ants are similar in appearance to Nothomyrmecia , but can be distinguished from the shape of their node . They also had a powerful sting located in the abdomen . Two of the three species are from the Eocene while the third species is from the Late Oligocene . 
 = = = P. janzeni = = = 
 P. janzeni was described by Cesare Baroni Urbani of the University of Basel , Switzerland in 2000 , based on two specimens preserved in Baltic amber from Kaliningrad , Russia . The species is from the Eocene , Lutetian to <unk> stage . Both specimens are preserved very well , with specimen number two being larger and more visible . Specimen number one is presumed to be a worker ; type material includes a holotype worker and a paratype <unk> , donated to the Geological @-@ <unk> Institute and Museum , the University of Hamburg by palaeoentomologist Jens @-@ Wilhelm Janzen . The ant was named after Janzen by Baroni Urbani . The estimated body length is 13 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 51 in ) long with an elongated head , and large oval @-@ shaped eyes are present . The antennae are long and consist of 12 segments with a bent scape . The mandibles are very long and curved , being three @-@ quarters the length of the total size of the head . Both the legs and mesosoma are long and slender ; unlike modern ants , P. janzeni has two spurs on the <unk> instead of one . The petiole is high and domed shape while postpetiole is bell @-@ shaped . The gaster is long with round sides , divided into five segments . The whole body and some portions of the legs were covered by weakly curved hairs , erect and suberect . The holotype specimen is brown in colour while the paratype is black . While P. janzeni looks similar to P. longiceps , the <unk> on the scapes of P. janzeni is absent . 
 = = = P. longiceps = = = 
 P. longiceps was described by Gustav Mayr in 1868 , based on a holotype worker collected in Baltic amber from the Eocene . The original specimen collected by Mayr , however , has been lost . The estimated body length of P. longiceps is 12 to 14 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 47 to 0 @.@ 55 in ) long , with a thick petiole and large propodeal teeth . Unlike P. janzeni , P. longiceps has erect and suberect hairs on the scape . These hairs are also longer and thicker on the legs and on other body parts . The mandibles are very long and curved , and the head is longer than its total width ( 2 @.@ 2 to 2 @.@ 64 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 087 to 0 @.@ 104 in ) long and 1 @.@ 68 to 2 @.@ 08 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 066 to 0 @.@ 082 in ) wide ) . The legs are very long with strong claws , and a stinger is present in the abdomen . Wheeler ( 1915 ) described a male P. longiceps , commenting that the head is short but broad with very large eyes while the mandibles are small and far apart . The body is dark brown or blackish in colour , and the wings are somewhat yellowish . 
 = = = P. wappleri = = = 
 P. wappleri was described in 2012 by Russian palaeoentomologist Gennady M. Dlussky of the Moscow State University , from a fossilised holotype worker found in Germany from the Aquitanian stage 29 to 30 million years ago . The specimen is currently housed in the Institut für Paläontologie at the University of Bonn , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia . Dlussky coined the specific epithet wappleri from the surname " Wappler " , as he named the ant after German palaeoentomologist Torsten Wappler . The estimated body length of P. wappleri is 14 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 55 in ) long , and the head is 1 @.@ 35 times longer than the total width of it . The eyes are small and oval shaped , located in the upper part of the head , which is four times as long as the eyes . The mandibles are nearly three @-@ quarters the length of the head ; P. wappleri differs from P. longiceps and P. janzeni due to the apex of the clypeal lobe being pointed instead of round , and the first segment of the flagellum is only half the length of the second segment . Before the discovery of P. wappleri , extinct Myrmeciinae ants were only found from Eocene deposits . This suggests that the subfamily was still present in Europe during the Late Oligocene . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Archibald and colleagues suggested the life habits of extinct Myrmeciinae ants including Prionomyrmex may have been similar to extant ants within the subfamily . These ants foraged on the ground and possibly onto trees and low vegetation while preying on arthropods . These ants may have collected plant nectar , as Myrmecia species use this as a food source . Workers may have not recruited nest mates to food sources or lay down pheromone trails , as these ants were solitary hunters . Workers would have relied on their vision to hunt for prey and help themselves navigate . 
 William Morton Wheeler comments that P. longiceps were possibly an arboreal nesting species . This means the ant did not live in the soil and nested in trees instead . He assumed this due to its long legs , strong claws and long mandibles ; Prionomyrmex was also assumed to be predacious , equipped with a well developed and powerful sting that was most likely used to kill prey . Prionomyrmex may have preferred a jungle habitat at low elevations , and is even more primitive in its body structure than Myrmecia . Female <unk> were known to parasite Prionomyrmex ants . 
 = Sexuality after spinal cord injury = 
 Although spinal cord injury ( SCI ) often causes sexual dysfunction , many people with SCI are able to have satisfying sex lives . Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas , which in turn has important effects on quality of life . Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion . This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion , and affects orgasm , erection , ejaculation , and vaginal lubrication . More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain , weakness , and side effects of medications . Psycho @-@ social causes include depression and altered self @-@ image . However , many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives , and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm . People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily , by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts . Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation , so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation . 
 Drugs , devices , surgery , and other interventions exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation . Although male fertility is reduced , many men with SCI can still father children , particularly with medical interventions . Women 's fertility is not usually affected , although precautions must be taken for safe pregnancy and delivery . People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations , and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation . Education and counseling about sexuality is an important part of SCI rehabilitation but is often missing or insufficient . Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development of sexuality and includes education for them and their families . Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI , particularly when held by professional caregivers . Body image and other insecurities affect sexual function , and have profound repercussions on self @-@ esteem and self @-@ concept . SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships , due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability , but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages . Relationships , self @-@ esteem , and reproductive ability are all aspects of sexuality , which encompasses not just sexual practices but a complex array of factors : cultural , social , psychological , and emotional influences . 
 = = Sexuality and identity = = 
 Sexuality is an important part of each person 's identity , and has not just biological but psychological , emotional , spiritual , social , and cultural aspects . It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships , self @-@ image , sex drive , reproduction , sexual orientation , and gender expression . Each person 's sexuality is influenced by lifelong socialization , in which factors such as religious and cultural background play a part , and is expressed in self @-@ esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself ( identifying as a woman , or an attractive person ) . 
 SCI is extremely disruptive to sexuality , and it most frequently happens to young people , who are at a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives . Yet the importance of sexuality as a part of life is not diminished by a disabling injury . Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual , research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life . In fact , of all abilities they would like to have return , most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority , and most <unk> rated it second , after hand and arm function . Sexual function has a profound impact on self @-@ esteem and adjustment to life post @-@ injury . People who are able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life . 
 = = Sexual function = = 
 SCI usually causes sexual dysfunction , due to problems with sensation and the body 's arousal responses . The ability to experience sexual pleasure and orgasm are among the top priorities for sexual rehabilitation among injured people . 
 Much research has been done into erection . By two years post @-@ injury , 80 % of men recover at least partial erectile function , though many experience problems with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them . Studies have found that half or up to 65 % of men with SCI have orgasms , although the experience may feel different than it did before the injury . Most men say it feels weaker , and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve . 
 Common problems women experience post @-@ SCI are pain with intercourse and difficulty achieving orgasm . Around half of women with SCI are able to reach orgasm , usually when their genitals are stimulated . Some women report the sensation of orgasm to be the same as before the injury , and others say the sensation is reduced . 
 = = = Complete and incomplete injury = = = 
 The severity of the injury is an important aspect in determining how much sexual function returns as a person recovers . According to the American Spinal Injury Association grading scale , an incomplete SCI is one in which some amount of sensation or motor function is preserved in the rectum . This indicates that the brain can still send and receive some messages to the lowest parts of the spinal cord , beyond the damaged area . In people with incomplete injury , some or all of the spinal tracts involved in sexual responses remain intact , allowing , for example , orgasms like those of uninjured people . In men , having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries . 
 Even people with complete SCI , in whom the spinal cord cannot transmit any messages past the level of the lesion , can achieve orgasm . In 1960 , in one of the earliest studies to look at orgasm and SCI , the term phantom orgasm was coined to describe women 's perception of orgasmic sensations despite SCI — but subsequent studies have suggested the experience is not merely psychological . Men with complete SCI report sexual sensations at the time of ejaculation , accompanied by physical signs normally found at orgasm , such as increased blood pressure . Women can experience orgasm with vibration to the cervix regardless of level or completeness of injury ; the sensation is the same as uninjured women experience . The peripheral nerves of the parasympathetic nervous system that carry messages to the brain ( afferent nerve fibers ) may explain why people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations . One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the vagus nerve bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain . Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual arousal and orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris , cervix , or vagina , which are each innervated by different nerve pathways , which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area , function might be preserved in others . In both injured and uninjured people , the brain is responsible for the way sensations of climax are perceived : the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain , rather than a specific area of the body . 
 = = = Level of injury = = = 
 In addition to completeness of injury , the location of damage on the spinal cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury . Injuries can occur in the cervical ( neck ) , thoracic ( back ) , lumbar ( lower back ) , or sacral ( pelvic ) levels . Between each pair of vertebrae , spinal nerves branch off of the spinal cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body . The location of injury to the spinal cord maps to the body , and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve is called a dermatome . All dermatomes below the level of injury to the spinal cord may lose sensation . 
 An injury at a lower point on the spine does not necessarily mean better sexual function ; for example , people with injuries in the sacral region are less likely to be able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on the spine . Women with injuries above the sacral level have a greater likelihood of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries ( 59 % vs 17 % ) . In men , injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation , and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction . This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain , which sacral injuries might interrupt . 
 = = = <unk> and reflexogenic responses = = = 
 The body 's physical arousal response ( vaginal lubrication and engorgement of the clitoris in women and erection in men ) occurs due to two separate pathways which normally work together : psychogenic and reflex . Arousal due to fantasies , visual input , or other mental stimulation is a psychogenic sexual experience , and that resulting from physical contact to the genital area is reflexogenic . In psychogenic arousal , messages travel from the brain via the spinal cord to the nerves in the genital area . The psychogenic pathway is served by the spinal cord at levels T11 – L2 . Thus people injured above the level of the T11 vertebra do not usually experience psychogenic erection or vaginal lubrication , but those with an injury below T12 can . Even without these physical responses , people with SCI often feel aroused , just as uninjured people do . The ability to feel the sensation of a pinprick and light touch in the dermatomes for T11 – L2 predicts how well the ability to have psychogenic arousal is preserved in both sexes . Input from the psychogenic pathway is sympathetic , and most of the time it sends inhibitory signals that prevent the physical arousal response ; however , in response to sexual stimulation , excitatory signals are increased while the inhibition is reduced . Removing the inhibition that is normally present allows the spinal reflexes that trigger the arousal response to take effect . 
 The reflexogenic pathway activates the parasympathetic nervous system in response to the sensation of touch . It is mediated by a reflex arc that goes to the spinal cord ( not to the brain ) and is served by the sacral segments of the spinal cord at S2 – S4 . A woman with a spinal cord lesion above T11 may not be able to experience psychogenic vaginal lubrication , but may still have reflex lubrication if her sacral segments are uninjured . Likewise , although a man 's ability to get a psychogenic erection when mentally aroused may be impaired after a higher @-@ level SCI , he may still be able to get a reflex or " spontaneous " erection . These erections may result in the absence of psychological arousal when the penis is touched or brushed , e.g. by clothing , but they do not last long and are generally lost when the stimulus is removed . Reflex erections may increase in frequency after SCI , due to the loss of inhibitory input from the brain that would suppress the response in an uninjured man . Conversely , an injury below the S1 level impairs reflex erections but not psychogenic erections . People who have some preservation of sensation in the dermatomes at the S4 and S5 levels and display a <unk> reflex ( contraction of the pelvic floor in response to pressure on the clitoris or glans penis ) are usually able to experience reflex erections or lubrication . Like other reflexes , reflexive sexual responses may be lost immediately after injury but return over time as the individual recovers from spinal shock . 
 = = = Factors in reduced function = = = 
 Most people with SCI have problems with the body 's physical sexual arousal response . Problems that result directly from impaired neural transmission are called primary sexual dysfunction . The function of the genitals is almost always affected by SCI , by alteration , reduction , or complete loss of sensation . <unk> pain , in which damaged nerve pathways signal pain in the absence of any noxious stimulus , is common after SCI and interferes with sex . 
 Secondary dysfunction results from factors that follow from the injury , such as loss of bladder and bowel control or impaired movement . The main barrier to sexual activity that people with SCI cite is physical limitation ; e.g. balance problems and muscle weakness cause difficulty with positioning . Spasticity , tightening of muscles due to increased muscle tone , is another complication that interferes with sex . Some medications have side effects that impede sexual pleasure or interfere with sexual function : antidepressants , muscle relaxants , sleeping pills and drugs that treat spasticity . Hormonal changes that alter sexual function may take place after SCI ; levels of prolactin heighten , women temporarily stop menstruating ( amenorrhea ) , and men experience reduced levels of testosterone . Testosterone deficiency causes reduced libido , increased weakness , fatigue , and failure to respond to erection @-@ enhancing drugs . 
 Tertiary sexual dysfunction results from psychological and social factors . Reduced libido , desire , or experience of arousal could be due to psychological or situational factors such as depression , anxiety , and changes in relationships . Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI , and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused . Depression is the most common cause of problems with arousal in people with SCI . People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury . Anxiety and drug and alcohol abuse may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur , which can exacerbate sexual difficulties . Drug and alcohol abuse increase unhealthy behaviors , straining relationships and social functioning . SCI can lead to significant insecurities , which have repercussions for sexuality and self @-@ image . SCI often affects body image , either due to the host of changes in the body that affect appearance ( e.g. unused muscles in the legs become atrophied ) , or due to changes in self @-@ perception not directly from physical changes . People frequently find themselves less attractive and expect others not to be attracted to them after SCI . These insecurities cause fear of rejection and deter people from initiating contact or sexual activity or engaging in sex . Feelings of undesirability or worthlessness even lead some to suggest to their partners that they find someone able bodied . 
 = = Fertility = = 
 = = = Male = = = 
 Men with SCI rank the ability to father children among their highest concerns relating to sexuality . Male fertility is reduced after SCI , due to a combination of problems with erections , ejaculation , and quality of the semen . As with other types of sexual response , ejaculation can be psychogenic or reflexogenic , and the level of injury affects a man 's ability to experience each type . As many as 95 % of men with SCI have problems with ejaculation ( <unk> ) , possibly due to impaired coordination of input from different parts of the nervous system . Erection , orgasm , and ejaculation can each occur independently , although the ability to ejaculate seems linked to the quality of the erection , and the ability to orgasm is linked to the ejaculation facility . Even men with complete injuries may be able to ejaculate , because other nerves involved in ejaculation can effect the response without input from the spinal cord . In general , the higher the level of injury , the more physical stimulation the man needs to ejaculate . Conversely , premature or spontaneous ejaculation can be a problem for men with injuries at levels T12 – L1 . It can be severe enough that ejaculation is provoked by thinking a sexual thought , or for no reason at all , and is not accompanied by orgasm . 
 Most men have a normal sperm count , but a high proportion of sperm are abnormal ; they are less motile and do not survive as well . The reason for these abnormalities is not known , but research points to dysfunction of the seminal vesicles and prostate , which concentrate substances that are toxic to sperm . <unk> , immune proteins which promote an inflammatory response , are present at higher concentrations in semen of men with SCI , as is platelet @-@ activating factor <unk> ; both are harmful to sperm . Another immune @-@ related response to SCI is the presence of a higher number of white blood cells in the semen . 
 = = = Female = = = 
 The numbers of women with SCI giving birth and having healthy babies are increasing . Around a half to two @-@ thirds of women with SCI report they might want to have children , and 14 – 20 % do get pregnant at least once . Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI , there is a stress response that can happen immediately post @-@ injury that alters levels of fertility @-@ related hormones in the body . In about half of women , menstruation stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months — it returns within a year for a large majority . After menstruation returns , women with SCI become pregnant at a rate close to that of the rest of the population . 
 Pregnancy is associated with greater @-@ than @-@ normal risks in women with SCI , among them increased risk of deep vein thrombosis , respiratory infection , and urinary tract infection . Considerations exist such as maintaining proper positioning in a wheelchair , prevention of pressure sores , and increased difficulty moving due to weight gain and changes in center of balance . Assistive devices may need to be altered and medications changed . For women with injuries above T6 , a risk during labor and delivery that threatens both mother and fetus is autonomic dysreflexia , in which the blood pressure increases to dangerous levels high enough to cause potentially deadly stroke . Drugs such as <unk> and captopril can be used to manage an episode if it occurs , and epidural anesthesia helps although it is not very reliable in women with SCI . Anesthesia is used for labor and delivery even for women without sensation , who may only experience contractions as abdominal discomfort , increased spasticity , and episodes of autonomic dysreflexia . Reduced sensation in the pelvic area means women with SCI usually have less painful delivery ; in fact , they may fail to realize when they go into labor . If there are deformities in the pelvis or spine caesarian section may be necessary . Babies of women with SCI are more likely to be born prematurely , and , premature or not , they are more likely to be small for their gestational time .

 = = = <unk> problems = = = 
 Although erections are not necessary for satisfying sexual encounters , many men see them as important , and treating erectile dysfunction improves their relationships and quality of life . Whatever treatment is used , it works best in combination with talk @-@ oriented therapy to help integrate it into the sex life . Oral medications and mechanical devices are the first choice in treatment because they are less invasive , are often effective , and are well tolerated . Oral medications include sildenafil ( Viagra ) , tadalafil ( Cialis ) , and vardenafil ( Levitra ) . Penis pumps induce erections without the need for drugs or invasive treatments . To use a pump , the man inserts his penis into a cylinder then pumps it to create a vacuum , which draws blood into the penis making it erect . He then slides a ring from the outside of the cylinder onto the base of the penis to hold the blood in and maintain the erection . A man who is able to get an erection but has trouble maintaining it for long enough can use a ring by itself . The ring cannot be left on for more than 30 minutes and cannot be used at the same time as anticoagulant medications . 
 If oral and mechanical treatments fail , the second choice is local injections : medications such as <unk> and prostaglandin that alter the blood flow and trigger erection are injected into the penis . This method is preferred for its effectiveness , but can cause pain and scarring . Another option is to insert a small pellet of medication into the urethra , but this requires higher doses than injections and may not be as effective . Topical medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used , but are not very effective or well tolerated . Electrical stimulation of efferent nerves at the S2 level can be used to trigger an erection that lasts as long as the stimulation does . Surgical implants , either of flexible rods or inflatable tubes , are reserved for when other methods fail because of the potential for serious complications , which occur in as many as 10 % of cases . They carry the risk of eroding penile tissue ( breaking through the skin ) . Although satisfaction among men who use them is high , if they do need to be removed implants make other methods such as injections and vacuum devices unusable due to tissue damage . It is also possible for erectile dysfunction to exist not as a direct result of SCI but due to factors such as major depression , diabetes , or drugs such as those taken for spasticity . Finding and treating the root cause may alleviate the problem . For example , men who experience erectile problems as the result of a testosterone deficiency can receive androgen replacement therapy . 
 = = = <unk> and male fertility = = = 
 Without medical intervention , the male fertility rate after SCI is 5 – 14 % , but the rate increases with treatments . However , even with all available medical interventions , fewer than half of men with SCI can father children . Assisted insemination is usually required . As with erection , therapies used to treat infertility in uninjured men are used for those with SCI . For <unk> in SCI , the first @-@ line method for sperm retrieval is penile <unk> stimulation ( PVS ) . A high @-@ speed vibrator is applied to the glans penis to trigger a reflex that causes ejaculation , usually within a few minutes . Reports of efficacy with PVS range from 15 – 88 % , possibly due to differences in vibrator settings and experience of clinicians , as well as level and completeness of injury . Complete lesions strictly above <unk> 's nucleus ( S2 – S4 ) are responsive to PVS in 98 % , but complete lesions of the S2 – S4 segments are not . In case of failure with PVS , spermatozoa are sometimes collected by <unk> : an electrical probe is inserted into the rectum , where it triggers ejaculation . The success rate is 80 – 100 % , but the technique requires anaesthesia and does not have the potential to be done at home that PVS has . Both PVS and <unk> carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia , so drugs to prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible . Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm . If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm , sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous <unk> sperm aspiration . These procedures yield sperm in 86 – 100 % of cases , but nonsurgical treatments are preferred . Premature or spontaneous ejaculation is treated with antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , which are known to delay ejaculation as a side effect . 
 = = = Women = = = 
 Compared with the options available for treating sexual dysfunction in men ( for whom results are concretely observable ) , those available for women are limited . For example , PDE5 inhibitors , oral medications for treating erectile dysfunction in men , have been tested for their ability to increase sexual responses such as arousal and orgasm in women — but no controlled trials have been done in women with SCI , and trials in other women yielded only inconclusive results . In theory , women 's sexual response could be improved using a vacuum device made to draw blood into the clitoris , but few studies on treatments for sexual function in women with SCI have been carried out . There is a particular paucity of information outside the area of reproduction . 
 = = = Education and counseling = = = 
 Counseling about sex and sexuality by medical professionals , psychologists , social workers , and nurses is a part of most SCI rehabilitation programs . Education is part of the followup treatment for people with SCI , as are psychotherapy , peer mentorship , and social activities ; these are helpful for improving skills needed for socializing and relationships . Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem , appropriate sexual rehabilitation care takes into account the individual as a whole , for example addressing issues with relationships and self @-@ esteem . Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression and stress , and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity . Education includes information about birth control or assistive devices such as those for positioning in sex , or advice and ideas for addressing problems such as incontinence and autonomic dysreflexia . 
 Many SCI patients have received misinformation about the effects of their injury on their sexual function and benefit from education about it . Although sexual education shortly after injury is known to be helpful and desired , it is frequently missing in rehabilitation settings ; a common complaint from those who go through rehabilitation programs is that they offer insufficient information about sexuality . Longer @-@ term education and counseling on sex after discharge from a hospital setting are especially important , yet sexuality is one of the most often neglected areas in long @-@ term SCI rehabilitation , particularly for women . Care providers may refrain from addressing the topic because they feel intimidated or unequipped to handle it . Clinicians must be circumspect in bringing up sexual matters since people may be uncomfortable with or unready for the subject . Many patients wait for providers to broach the topic even if they do want the information . 
 A person 's experience in managing sexuality after the injury relies not only on physical factors like severity and level of the injury , but on aspects of life circumstances and personality such as sexual experience and attitudes about sex . As well as evaluating physical concerns , clinicians must take into account factors that affect each patient 's situation : gender , age , cultural , and social factors . Aspects of patients ' cultural and religious backgrounds , even if unnoticed before the injury caused sexual dysfunction , affect care and treatments — particularly when cultural attitudes and assumptions of patients and care providers conflict . Health professionals must be sensitive to issues of sexual orientation and gender identity , showing respect and acceptance while communicating , listening , and emotionally supporting . Providers who treat SCI have been found to assume their patients are heterosexual or to exclude LGBTQ patients from their awareness , potentially resulting in substandard care . Academic research on sexuality and disability under @-@ represents LGBTQ perspectives as well . 
 As well as the patient , the partner of an injured person frequently needs support and counseling . It can help with adjustment to a new relationship dynamic and self @-@ image ( such as being placed in the role of caretaker ) or with stresses that arise in the sexual relationship . Frequently , partners of injured people must contend with feelings like guilt , anger , anxiety , and exhaustion while dealing with the added financial burden of lost wages and medical expenses . Counseling aims to strengthen the relationship by improving communication and trust . 
 = = = = Children and adolescents = = = = 
 Not only does SCI present children and adolescents with many of the same difficulties adults face , it impacts the development of their sexuality . Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults , very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people . Injured children and adolescents need ongoing , age @-@ appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function . Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality , but as they age they become curious just as able @-@ bodied children do , and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information . Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood , including in sexuality and social interaction , beginning early and intensifying during adolescence . Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children 's questions . Once patients reach their teens , they need more specific information about pregnancy , birth control , self @-@ esteem , and dating . Teenagers with lost or reduced genital sensation benefit from education about alternative ways to experience pleasure and satisfaction from sexual acts . The teen years are often particularly difficult for those with SCI , in terms of body image and relationships . Given the importance they place on sexuality and privacy , adolescents may experience humiliation when parents or caregivers bathe them or take care of bowel and bladder needs . They can benefit from sexuality counseling , support groups , and mentoring by adults with SCI who can share experiences and lead discussions with peers . With the right care and education from family and professionals , injured children and adolescents can develop into sexually healthy adults . 
 = = = Changes in sexual practices = = = 
 People make a variety of sexual adaptations to help adjust to SCI . They often change their sexual practices , moving away from genital stimulation and intercourse and toward greater emphasis on touching above the level of injury and other aspects of intimacy such as kissing and caressing . It is necessary to discover new sexual positions if ones used previously have become too difficult . Other factors that enhance sexual pleasure are positive memories , fantasies , relaxation , meditation , breathing techniques , and most importantly , trust with a partner . People with SCI can make use of visual , auditory , olfactory , and tactile stimuli . It is possible to train oneself to be more mindful of the cerebral aspects of sex and of feeling in areas of the body that have sensation ; this increases chances of orgasm . The importance of desire and comfort is the reasoning behind the quip " the most important sexual organ is the brain . " 
 Adjusting to post @-@ injury changes in the body 's sensation is difficult enough to cause some to give up on the idea of satisfying sex at first . But changes in sensitivity above and at the level of injury occur over time ; people may find erogenous zones like the nipples or ears have become more sensitive , enough to be sexually satisfying . They may discover new erogenous zones that were not erotic before the injury ; care providers can help direct this discovery . These erogenous areas can even lead to orgasm when stimulated . Such changes may result from " remapping " of sensory areas in the brain due to neuroplasticity , particularly when sensation in the genitals is completely lost . Commonly there is an area on the body between the areas where sensation is lost and those where is preserved called a " transition zone " that has increased sensitivity and is often sexually pleasurable when stimulated . Also known as a " border zone " , this area may feel the way the penis or clitoris did before injury , and can even give orgasmic sensation . Due to such changes in sensation , people are encouraged to explore their bodies to discover what areas are pleasurable . Masturbation is a useful way to learn about the body 's new responses . 
 Tests exist to measure how much sensation a person has retained in the genitals after an injury , which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation . Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm . Injured people who are able to achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity . Sex toys such as vibrators are available , e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity , and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities . For example , a hand strap can be added to a vibrator or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function . 
 = = = Considerations for sexual activity = = = 
 SCI presents extra needs to consider for sexual activity ; for example muscle weakness and movement limitations restrict options for positioning . Pillows or devices such as wedges can be placed to help achieve and maintain a desired position for people affected by weakness or movement limitations . Assistive devices exist to aid in motion , such as sliding chairs to provide pelvic thrust . Spasticity and pain also create barriers to sexual activity ; these changes may require couples to use new positions , such as seated in a wheelchair . A warm bath can be taken prior to sex , and massage and stretching can be incorporated into foreplay to ease spasticity . 
 Another consideration is loss of sensation , which puts people at risk for wounds such as pressure sores and injuries that could become worse before being noticed . Friction from sexual activity may damage the skin , so it is necessary after sex to inspect areas that could have been hurt , particularly the buttocks and genital area . People who already have pressure sores must take care not to make the wounds worse . Irritation to the genitals increases risk for vaginal infections , which get worse if they go unnoticed . Women who do not get sufficient vaginal lubrication on their own can use a commercially available personal lubricant to decrease friction . 
 Another risk is autonomic dysreflexia ( AD ) , a medical emergency involving dangerously high blood pressure . People at risk for AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex , but if it does occur they must stop and seek treatment . However mild signs of AD such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm . In fact , some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing , or even climactic . 
 A concern for sexual activity that is not dangerous but that can be upsetting for both partners is bladder or bowel leakage due to urinary or fecal incontinence . Couples can prepare for sex by draining the bladder using intermittent catheterization or placing towels down in advance . People with indwelling urinary catheters must take special care with them , removing them or taping them out of the way . 
 Birth control is another consideration : women with SCI are usually not prescribed oral contraceptives since the hormones in them increase the risk of blood clots , for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk . Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced . <unk> that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function . An option of choice for women is for partners to use condoms . 
 = = Long @-@ term adjustment = = 
 In the first months after an injury , people commonly prioritize other aspects of rehabilitation over sexual matters , but in the long term , adjustment to life with SCI necessitates addressing sexuality . Although physical , psychological and emotional factors militate to reduce the frequency of sex after injury , it increases after time . As years go by , the odds that a person will become involved in a sexual relationship increase . Difficulties adjusting to a changed appearance and physical limitations contribute to reduced frequency of sexual acts , and improved body image is associated with an increase . Like frequency , sexual desire and sexual satisfaction often decrease after SCI . The reduction in women 's sexual desire and frequency may be in part because they believe they can no longer enjoy sex , or because their independence or social opportunities are reduced . As time goes by people usually adjust sexually , adapting to their changed bodies . Some 80 % of women return to being sexually active , and the numbers who report being sexually satisfied range from 40 – 88 % . Although women 's satisfaction is usually lower than before the injury , it improves as time passes . Women report higher rates of sexual satisfaction than men post @-@ SCI for as many as 10 – 45 years . More than a quarter of men have substantial problems with adjustment to their post @-@ injury sexual functioning . Sexual satisfaction depends on a host of factors , some more important than the physical function of the genitals : intimacy , quality of relationships , satisfaction of partners , willingness to be sexually experimental , and good communication . Genital function is not as important to men 's sexual satisfaction as are their partners ' satisfaction and intimacy in their relationships . For women , quality of relationships , closeness with partners , sexual desire , and positive body image , as well as the physical function of the genitals , contribute sexual satisfaction . For both sexes , long @-@ term relationships are associated with higher sexual satisfaction . 
 = = Relationships = = 
 A catastrophic injury such as SCI puts strain on marriages and other romantic relationships , which in turn has important implications for quality of life . Partners of injured people often feel out of control , overwhelmed , angry , and guilty while having added work related to the injury , less help with responsibilities like parenting , and loss of wages . Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression for the person with SCI , while supportive relationships are protective . Relationships change as partners take on new roles , such as that of caregiver , which may conflict with the role of partner and require substantial sacrifice of time and self @-@ care . These changes in responsibilities may mean a reverse in societally determined gender roles within relationships ; inability to fulfil these roles impacts sexuality in general . Sexual dysfunction is a stressor in relationships . People are often as concerned about failing to keep a partner satisfied as they are about meeting their own sexual needs . In fact , two of the top reasons people with SCI cite for wanting to have sex are for intimacy and to keep a partner . The frequency of sex correlates with the desire of the uninjured partner . 
 Although problems with sexual function that result from SCI play a part in some divorces , they are not as important as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage . People with SCI get divorced more often than the rest of the population , and marriages that took place before the injury fail more often than those that took place after ( 33 % vs. 21 % ) . People married before the injury report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after , possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty adjusting to the new circumstances . For those who chose to become involved with someone after an injury , the disability was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset . Understanding and acceptance of the limitations that result from the injury on the part of the uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage . Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner , sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the injury . Thus counseling is important , not just for managing changes in self @-@ perception but in perceptions about relationships . 
 Despite the stresses that SCI places on people and relationships , studies have shown that people with SCI are able to have happy and fulfilling romantic relationships and marriages , and to raise well @-@ adjusted children . People with SCI who wish to be parents may question their ability to raise children and opt not to have them , but studies have shown no difference in parenting outcomes between injured and uninjured groups . Children of women with SCI do not have worse self @-@ esteem , adjustment , or attitudes toward their parents . Women who have children post @-@ SCI have a higher quality of life , even though parenting adds demands and challenges to their lives . 
 For those who are single when injured or who become single , SCI causes difficulties and insecurities with respect to one 's ability to meet new partners and start relationships . In some settings , beauty standards cause people to view disabled bodies as less attractive , limiting the options for sexual and romantic partners of people with disabilities like SCI . Furthermore , physical disabilities are stigmatized , causing people to avoid contact with disabled people , particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI . The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self @-@ consciousness and embarrassment in public . However , they can increase their social success by using impression management techniques to change how they are perceived and create a more positive image of themselves in others ' eyes . Physical limitations create difficulties ; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners . Difficulties with mobility and the lack of disabled accessibility of social spaces ( e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps ) create a further barrier to social activity and limit the ability to meet partners . Isolation and its associated risk of depression can be limited by participating in physical activities , social gatherings , clubs , and online chat and dating . 
 = = Society and culture = = 
 Negative societal attitudes and stereotypes about people with disabilities like SCI affect interpersonal interactions and self @-@ image , with important implications for quality of life . In fact , for women , psychological factors have a more important impact on sexual adjustment and activity than physical ones . Negative attitudes about disability ( along with relationships and social support ) are more predictive of outcome than even the level or completeness of injury . Stereotypes exist that people with SCI ( particularly women ) are uninterested in , unsuitable for , or incapable of sexual relationships or encounters . “ People think we can only date people in wheelchairs , that we ’ re lucky to get any guy , that we can ’ t be picky , ” remarked Mia <unk> , who is profiled in Push Girls , a 2012 reality series about four spinal cord injured women . Not only do they affect injured people 's self @-@ image , these stereotypes are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation . Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual , particularly if the injury occurred at a young age and the patient never had sexual experiences . Failure to recognize injured people 's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control , information about sexuality , and sexual health @-@ related medical care such as annual gynecological exams . Another common belief that impacts sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function ; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance of the rest of the body and of the individual . 
 Cultural attitudes toward gender roles have profound effects on people with SCI . The injury can cause insecurities surrounding sexual identity , particularly if the disability precludes fulfilment of societally taught gender norms . Female beauty standards propagated by mass media and culture portray the ideal woman as able bodied : as one fashion model with a SCI commented , " when you have a devastating injury or disability , you ’ re not often thought of as sensual or pretty because you don 't look like the women in the magazines . " Inability to meet these standards can lower self @-@ esteem , even if these ideals are also unattainable for most able @-@ bodied women . Poorer self @-@ esteem is associated with worse sexual adjustment and quality of life , and higher rates of loneliness , stress , and depression . Males are also affected by societal expectations , such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess . Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure that emphasizes the ability to have erections and sexual intercourse . Men who have strong sexual desire but who are not able to perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression , particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity . Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate , unmanly , insecure , and less satisfied with life . Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self @-@ esteem , treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation . SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability : those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation . Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process . 
 = Architecture of Denmark = 
 The architecture of Denmark has its origins in the Viking period , richly revealed by archaeological finds . It became firmly established in the Middle Ages when first Romanesque , then Gothic churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country . It was during this period that , in a country with little access to stone , brick became the construction material of choice , not just for churches but also for fortifications and castles . 
 Under the influence of Frederick II and Christian IV , both of whom had been inspired by the castles of France , Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark , initially to improve the country 's fortifications , but increasingly to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the Renaissance style . In parallel , the half @-@ timbered style became popular for ordinary dwellings in towns and villages across the country . 
 Late in his reign , Christian IV also became an early proponent of Baroque which was to continue for a considerable time with many impressive buildings both in the capital and the provinces . Neoclassicism came initially from France but was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style . A productive period of Historicism ultimately merged into the 19th century National Romantic style . 
 It was not , however , until the 1960s that Danish architects entered the world scene with their highly successful Functionalism . This , in turn , has evolved into more recent world @-@ class masterpieces such as the Sydney Opera House and the Great Belt Bridge paving the way for a number of Danish designers to be rewarded for excellence both at home and abroad . 
 = = Middle Ages = = 
 = = = The Vikings = = = 
 Archaeological excavations in various parts of Denmark have revealed much about the way the Vikings lived . One of the most notable sites is Hedeby . Located some 45 km ( 28 mi ) south of the Danish border near the German town of Schleswig , it probably dates back to the end of the 8th century . The houses are deemed to be among the most sophisticated dwellings of their time . Oak frames were used for the walls , and the roofs were probably thatched . 
 Viking ring houses , such as those at Trelleborg , near Slagelse on the Danish island of Zealand , have a rather different , ship @-@ like shape , the long walls bulging outwards . Each house consisted of a large central hall , 18 m × 8 m ( 59 ft × 26 ft ) and two smaller rooms , one at each end . Those at <unk> ( c . 980 ) in the north of Jutland were 28 @.@ 5 metres long , 5 metres wide ( 93 @.@ 5 ft × 16 @.@ 4 ft wide ) at the ends and 7 @.@ 5 m in the middle , the long walls curving slightly outwards . The walls consisted of double rows of posts with planks wedged horizontally between them . A series of outer posts slanted towards the wall were possibly used to support the building like buttresses . 
 = = = Romanesque style = = = 
 Denmark 's first churches from the 9th century were built of timber and have not survived . Hundreds of stone churches in the Romanesque style were built in the 12th and 13th centuries . They had a flat @-@ ceilinged nave and chancel with small rounded windows and round arches . Granite boulders and limestone were initially the preferred building materials , but after brick production reached Denmark in the middle of the 12th century , brick quickly became the material of choice . Among the finest examples of brick Romanesque buildings are St. <unk> 's Church in <unk> ( c . 1170 ) and the unique Church of Our Lady in <unk> ( c . 1200 ) with its five tall towers . 
 The church at <unk> on the island of Bornholm was built around 1150 . Like three other churches on the island , it is a round church . The three @-@ storeyed building is supported by a circular outer wall and an exceptionally wide , hollow central column . 
 Construction of Lund Cathedral in Scania started in about 1103 when the region was part of the Kingdom of Denmark . It was the first of great Danish Romanesque cathedrals in the shape of a three @-@ aisled basilica with transepts . It seems to have been related to earlier German buildings , though there are also traces of Anglo @-@ Norman and Lombard influences . Ribe , which followed with its great cathedral ( 1150 – 1250 ) , had close trade contacts with the Rhine region of Germany . Both the materials , sandstone and tufa , and the models were taken from there . 
 = = = Gothic style = = = 
 Towards the end of the 13th century and until about 1500 , the Gothic style became the norm with the result that most of the older Romanesque churches were rebuilt or adapted to the Gothic style . The flat ceilings were replaced by high cross vaults , windows were enlarged with pointed arches , chapels and towers were added and the interiors were decorated with murals . Red brick was the material of choice as can be seen in St. Canute 's Cathedral , Odense ( 1300 – 1499 ) , and St. Peter 's Church , <unk> . St. Canute 's presents all the features of Gothic architecture : pointed arch , buttresses , ribbed vaulting , increased light and the spatial combination of nave and chancel . 
 Although most Gothic architecture in Denmark is to be found in churches and monasteries , there are examples in the secular field too . <unk> ( 1499 – 1506 ) , a rectangular castle in Scania , clearly presents Gothic features . It was commissioned by the Danish nobleman Jens <unk> <unk> who called on the services of Adam van Düren , a North German master who also worked on Lund Cathedral . The building contains many defensive features of the times , including parapets , false doors , dead @-@ end corridors , murder @-@ holes for pouring boiling pitch over the attackers , moats , drawbridges and various other death traps to protect the nobles against peasant uprisings . 
 = = = Half @-@ timbered buildings = = = 
 During the late Middle Ages , a slow transition began from the traditional wooden houses in towns and villages towards half @-@ timbered properties . One of the oldest in Denmark is Anne <unk> <unk> , a two @-@ storeyed townhouse in Svendborg on the island of Funen , which was constructed in 1560 . The building now forms part of the Svendborg Museum . 
 <unk> in the southern Swedish region of Scania which was formerly part of Denmark still has some 300 half @-@ timbered houses , several of them of historic importance . The oldest surviving half @-@ timbered house in Denmark , built in 1527 , is located in Køge on the east coast of Sealand . 
 The Old Town in Aarhus , Jutland , is an open @-@ air village museum consisting of 75 historical buildings collected from all parts of the country . They include a variety of half @-@ timbered houses , some dating back to the middle of the 16th century . 
 = = Renaissance = = 
 Renaissance architecture thrived during the reigns of Frederick II and especially Christian IV . Inspired by the French castles of the times , Flemish architects designed masterpieces such as Kronborg Castle in Helsingør and Frederiksborg Palace in Hillerød . In Copenhagen , Rosenborg Castle ( 1606 – 24 ) and <unk> or the former stock exchange ( 1640 ) are perhaps the city 's most remarkable Renaissance buildings . 
 During the reign of Frederick II , Kronborg Castle was designed by two Flemish architects , Hans Hendrik van <unk> who started the work in 1574 and <unk> van <unk> who finished it in 1585 . Modelled on a three @-@ winged French castle , it was finally completed as a full four @-@ winged building . The castle burnt down in 1629 but , under orders from Christian IV , was quickly rebuilt under the leadership of Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger , son of the famous Flemish artist . It is widely recognized as one of Europe 's most outstanding Renaissance castles and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . 
 Frederiksborg Palace ( 1602 – 20 ) in Hillerød is the largest Renaissance palace in Scandinavia . Christian IV had most of Frederick II 's original building pulled down in order to have van Steenwinckel complete a three @-@ winged French @-@ styled castle with a low terrace wing around a courtyard . The architectural expression and the decorative finish clearly reflect Dutch Renaissance preferences as evidenced by the ornamental portals and windows and especially in sweeping Italianate gables . 
 Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen , also built by Christian IV , is another example of the Dutch Renaissance style . In 1606 , the king first had a two @-@ storey summerhouse built on a site he used as a park for relaxation . He then decided to start work on a much more ambitious building , the castle , which developed in stages until a Dutch Renaissance masterpiece was completed in 1624 . Predating the castle , the Renaissance @-@ style park , is Denmark 's oldest royal garden . 
 Sponsored by Christian IV , <unk> , one of the first commodity exchanges in Europe , was built from 1618 to 1624 . It was designed to emphasize Copenhagen 's position as a commercial metropolis . Although inspired by the Dutch Renaissance style , the distinctive towers and <unk> on the roof reflect the taste of Christian IV . The characteristic spire of the building with four <unk> dragon tails topped by three crowns , symbolises the then Kingdom of Denmark , which included Norway and Sweden . 
 In 1614 , Christian IV began work on the construction of the then Danish <unk> in Scania , now in the south of Sweden , completing many of its buildings in the Renaissance style . Particularly impressive is the Church of the Trinity ( 1618 – 28 ) designed by Flemish @-@ Danish architect Lorenz van Steenwinckel . It is said to be Scandinavia 's finest example of a Renaissance church . 
 Christian IV also initiated a number of projects in Norway that were largely based on Renaissance architecture He established mining operations in Kongsberg and Røros , now a World Heritage Site . After a devastating fire in 1624 , the town of Oslo was moved to a new location and rebuilt as a fortified city with an orthogonal layout surrounded by ramparts , and renamed Christiania . King Christian also founded the trading city of Kristiansand , once again naming it after himself . 
 While stone buildings became more and more common as town houses , farms continued to be half @-@ timbered , sometimes in conjunction with a single stone house . Ordinary people continued to live in half @-@ timbered houses . 
 <unk> in northwestern Sealand began to develop towards the end of the Middle Ages . Prosperity peaked in the 17th century as corn grown locally was traded with Germany and the Netherlands . The half @-@ timbered houses which now form the museum date back to that period , providing an insight into how the town functioned at the time . 
 Danish country vicarages from this period tended to be built in the same style as farmhouses , though usually rather larger . A fine example is <unk> Vicarage near Kerteminde in north @-@ eastern Funen . The house itself is a thatched half @-@ timbered building with a large rectangular courtyard flanked by outhouses .

 As during the Renaissance period , it was again principally Dutch influence which predominated in Baroque architecture , although many of the features originated in Italy and France . Symmetry and regularity were primary concerns , often enhanced by a projecting central section on the main façade . 
 Copenhagen 's Round Tower was also one of Christian IV 's projects after he provided funding for an observatory as proposed by the astronomer Tycho Brahe . Under the initial leadership of Hans van Steenwinckel who surprisingly adapted the design to Dutch Baroque , the Tower was completed in 1642 with a height of almost 40 m . The bricks , specially ordered from the Netherlands , were of a hard @-@ burned , slender type , known as <unk> or <unk> . A 210 @-@ meter @-@ long spiral ramp leads to the top , providing panoramic views over Copenhagen . The Round Tower is the oldest functioning observatory in Europe . Until 1861 it was used by the University of Copenhagen , but today , anyone can observe the night sky through the tower 's astronomical telescope during the winter . 
 <unk> Manor ( 1673 ) near <unk> , Sealand , was built for the local functionary Jens Lauridsen . It was the first Baroque country house in Denmark , replacing the earlier Renaissance style . The inspiration came from Holland and the architect was probably Ewert Janssen . 
 One of the foremost designers of the times was the Danish architect Lambert van Haven whose masterpiece was the Church of Our Saviour , Copenhagen ( 1682 – 96 ) which relies on the Greek cross for its basic layout . The façade is segmented by Tuscan pilasters extending up to the full height of the building . Other features such as the distinctive corkscrew spire were however not undertaken until the reign of Frederick V. It was Lauritz de Thurah who finally completed the building in 1752 . 
 Charlottenborg ( 1672 – 83 ) , on Kongens Nytorv in the centre of Copenhagen , is said to be the most important pure Baroque building remaining in Denmark . Van Haven may have been involved in its design although Ewert Janssen is usually credited with the work . Several other mansion houses in Denmark have been based on its design . 
 It was Henrik Ruse , a Dutch building engineer , who was charged by Frederick III to develop the area around Kongens Nytorv , especially in connection with the <unk> Canal which was designed to become Copenhagen 's new harbour . It was not , however , until Christian V became king in 1670 that Niels Rosenkrantz completed the work . Over the next few years , numerous town houses were built along the northern or sunny side of the canal . The oldest , Number 9 , was completed in 1681 , probably by Christen Christensen , the harbour master . 
 <unk> Castle ( 1693 – 94 ) near Randers was designed by the Danish architect Ernst Brandenburger with assistance of the Swede Nicodemus Tessin who was invited to decorate the facade . The more sophisticated first @-@ floor apartments with their higher ceilings were designed for use by royalty . 
 The first Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen , designed by Elias David <unk> and completed in the 1740s , was certainly one of the most impressive Baroque buildings of its day . Although the palace itself was destroyed by fire in 1794 , the extensive showgrounds and riding arena completed by Niels Eigtved have survived undamaged and can be visited today . Fredensborg Palace ( 1731 ) , the royal residence on the shore of Sealand 's Lake <unk> , with its exquisite Chancellery House , is the work of Johan Cornelius Krieger who was the court gardener at Rosenborg Castle . The park at Fredensborg is one of Denmark 's largest and best preserved Baroque gardens . 
 After the turn of the 19th century , architecture developed into the late Baroque style . Among the major proponents were Johan Conrad Ernst who built the Chancery Building or <unk> ( 1721 ) on <unk> and Lauritz de Thurah who designed the <unk> Palace ( 1734 ) in <unk> , just north of Copenhagen . Even more ambitious was de Thurah 's work at <unk> near Roskilde , where he succeeded in working the components into a well @-@ balanced and cohesive Baroque palace . 
 = = = Rococo = = = 
 Following on closely from the Baroque period , Rococo came into fashion in the 1740s under the leadership of Nicolai Eigtved . Originally a gardener , Eigtved spent many years abroad where he became increasingly interested in architecture , especially the French Rococo style . On his return to Denmark , he built <unk> Palæ ( 1743 – 44 ) in Copenhagen as a residence for Crown Prince Frederick ( later Frederick V ) . It is now the National Museum . 
 Soon afterwards , he was given prestige assignments including the overall architectural design for the <unk> district of Copenhagen 1749 , planned around the strictly octagonal square containing the four Amalienborg Palaces and considered to be one of Europe 's most important Rococo complexes . Adam Gottlob Moltke who , as Frederick V 's <unk> or lord chamberlain , was in charge of the project gave Eigtved a free hand , not only to design the principal buildings but also to provide the area with straight broad streets and the mansions which lined them . Frederick V had wanted to emulate the grand building achievements of the French monarchs . Not surprisingly , therefore , the palace square is inspired by the Place de la Concorde in Paris from the same period . Although Eigtved died before the work was completed , other architects including Lauritz de Thurah faithfully continued to execute his plans . Perhaps the finest outcomes are the Amalienborg Palace complex , Frederik 's Church in its immediate vicinity and Frederiks Hospital . 
 Philip de Lange , although influenced by Eigtved , developed his own rather strict style during this period . His ornamental facade can be seen on the <unk> building ( 1750 ) on Gammel Strand in Copenhagen . The top storey with a gable was added later . De Lange also designed the small but well proportioned <unk> Church on Møn , the only Rococo village church in Denmark . 
 = = Neoclassical = = 
 Neoclassicism which relied on inspiration from ancient Greece and Rome , was brought to Denmark by the French architect Nicolas @-@ Henri Jardin . His countryman , the sculptor Jacques Saly , who was already well established in Denmark , persuaded Frederick V that Jardin could complete Frederik 's Church after Eigtved 's death . Although Jardin did not succeed in this , he was successful in designing several prestige Neoclassical buildings such as Bernstorff Palace ( 1759 – 65 ) in <unk> and Marienlyst Palace near Helsingør . 
 One of Jardin 's pupils , Caspar Frederik <unk> , turned out to be Denmark 's most prominent 18th @-@ century architect and is known as the Father of Danish Classicism . He undertook a considerable amount of redesign work , both for interiors and exteriors , including work on the Royal Theatre ( 1774 ) where he introduced a classical temple style with a wide entrance and large hall . He also carried out work on the Amalienborg complex including the colonnade , with its eight Ionic wooden columns , linking the crown prince 's residence ( <unk> Palæ ) with the king 's ( Moltkes Palæ ) . 
 Another remarkable example of neoclassicism is <unk> on the island of Møn in south @-@ eastern Denmark . This rather small country home built in the French Neoclassical style in the 1790s is exceptional in that it has a thatched roof . Like the surrounding Romantic park , the house was the work of Andreas <unk> , one of the foremost landscape architects of the times . It was designed as a summer retreat for Antoine de la Calmette , the island 's governor , and his wife , Lise . The building is T @-@ shaped with the main rooms on the ground floor , the first floor consisting of nine bedrooms . The interior was probably decorated by the leading decorator of the day , Joseph Christian Lillie . 
 = = 19th century = = 
 = = = Classicism = = = 
 After Hardorff 's death , the main proponent of Classicism was Christian Frederik Hansen who developed a more severe style with clean , simple forms and large , unbroken surfaces . From 1800 , he was in charge of all major building projects in Copenhagen where he designed the Copenhagen City Hall & Courthouse ( 1805 – 15 ) on Nytorv . He was also responsible for rebuilding Church of Our Lady ( Vor Frue Kirke ) and designing the surrounding square ( 1811 – 29 ) . 
 In 1800 , Hansen was also charged with rebuilding Christiansborg Palace which had burnt down in 1794 . Unfortunately , it burnt down once again in 1884 . All that remains is the magnificent chapel which , with its Ionic columns , conveys a sense of antiquity . 
 Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll is remembered above all for designing <unk> Museum . In 1822 , as a young man , he had experienced Karl Friedrich Schinkel 's classicism in Germany and France and had met the German @-@ born architect and archaeologist Franz Gau who introduced him to the colourful architecture of antiquity . His uncle , Jonas Collin , who was an active art and culture official under Frederick VI , awakened the King 's interest in a museum for Bertel Thorvaldsen , the Danish @-@ Icelandic sculptor , and asked Bindesbøll to make some sketches for the building . As <unk> 's designs stood out from those of other architects , he was given a commission to transform the Royal Carriage Depot and Theatre Scenery Painting Building into a museum . Emulating the construction of the <unk> and the Parthenon as freestanding buildings released from the traditional urban plan of closed streets , he completed the work in 1848 . He also incorporated aspects of ancient Egyptian architecture into his design , though " the plan as a whole ... is neither Egyptian nor Greek , but Bindesbøll 's own . " 
 = = = Historicism = = = 
 With the arrival of Historicism in the second half of the century , special importance was attached to high standards of craftsmanship and proper use of materials . This can be seen in Copenhagen 's University Library ( 1861 ) designed by Johan Daniel <unk> and inspired by St Fermo 's Church in Verona . 
 Vilhelm <unk> was one of the most productive 19th @-@ century architects . Perhaps more than anyone else , he contributed to the way Copenhagen appears today . His most important buildings include Copenhagen 's Hotel D ’ Angleterre ( 1875 ) and the Danish National Gallery ( 1891 ) . With the support of the Carlsberg company , he designed the Ny Carlsberg <unk> ( 1897 ) and a number of lavishly decorated buildings at the Carlsberg Brewery site , now under redevelopment as a new district in Copenhagen . 
 Ferdinand <unk> , also a proponent of Historicism , completed the reconstruction of Frederiksborg Palace after the fire in 1859 and designed the Parliament Building in Reykjavík , Iceland , at that time a Danish colony . His greatest achievement was , however , the completion of Frederik 's Church in Copenhagen . The site had become a ruin after work was stopped on Jardin 's original design in 1770 . <unk> 's plans differed significantly from Jardin 's in that the lateral towers were eliminated , the dome was lower and the columns were reduced from six to four before the main entrance . Nevertheless , the overall height almost matched Jardin 's , thanks to the lantern and the taller spire . The building , commonly known as the Marble Church , was completed in 1894 , more than 150 years after Eigtved had drawn up his original plans . 
 = = = National Romanticism = = = 
 Martin <unk> was one of the main proponents of the National Romantic style . The main aim was to use distinctive Nordic motifs from the distant past , as is clearly demonstrated in Copenhagen City Hall which was completed in 1905 . The City Hall is certainly Copenhagen 's most monumental and most original building from the last quarter of the 19th century with its impressive facade , the golden statue of <unk> just above the balcony and its tall , slim clock tower . It was inspired by the Siena City Hall . 
 Another participant in the National Romanticism movement was Hack Kampmann who designed the Aarhus Theatre in the Art Nouveau style at the very end of the century . 
 = = = Urban development = = = 
 The harbour town of Svendborg in the south east of Funen dates back to the 13th century . Real prosperity emerged in the 19th century when shipbuilding and trade became important drivers . The town subsequently underwent a period of renovation with new brick and stone buildings lining its narrow streets . The old town has now become an important tourist attraction . 
 The fine architectural style of Skagen on the northern tip of Jutland is quite distinctive . From the 19th century on , the houses were whitewashed and had red @-@ tiled roofs . Yellow and red tones dominated , backed by white chimneys and roof decorations . These traditions are not only to be found in the town 's old districts but are maintained in the newer residential areas . Several of the town 's more imposing buildings from the beginning of the 20th century were designed by the Ulrik Plesner , others were designed by well @-@ known architects such as Thorvald Bindesbøll . 
 = = 20th century = = 
 = = = Nordic Classicism = = = 
 Neoclassicism or increasingly Nordic Classicism continued to thrive at the beginning of the century until about 1930 as can be seen in Kay Fisker 's <unk> apartment buildings ( 1923 ) and Hack Kampmann 's police headquarters ( 1924 ) . Its development was no isolated phenomenon , drawing on existing classical traditions in the Nordic countries , and from new ideas being pursued in German @-@ speaking cultures . It can thus be characterised as a combination of direct and indirect influences from vernacular architecture ( Nordic , Italian and German ) and Neoclassicism . 
 While the movement had its greatest level of success in Sweden , there were a number of other important Danish proponents including Ivar Bentsen , Kaare Klint , Arne Jacobsen , Carl Petersen and Steen Eiler Rasmussen . Bentsen , with the assistance of Thorkild <unk> , designed Denmark 's first terraced houses in the <unk> district of Copenhagen . Very appropriately Klint , working with Bentsen , adapted the design of Frederiks Hospital to serve as the Danish Museum of Art & Design . Carl Petersen 's main achievement was the <unk> Museum built for collections of art from Funen . Steen Rasmussen is remembered above all for his town planning activities and for his contributions to the Dansk <unk> ( Danish town planning laboratory ) . 
 = = = Expressionism = = = 
 Grundtvig 's Church in <unk> , Copenhagen , is named after the Danish philosopher and pastor Nikolai Grundtvig , remembered by most Danes for his resounding hymns , now an integral part of the national culture . As a result of its unusual appearance , it is Denmark 's most famous expressionist church . Designed by Peder Vilhelm Jensen @-@ Klint , it relied heavily on Scandinavian brick gothic traditions , especially Danish village churches with stepped gables . Jensen @-@ Klint combined the modern geometric forms of Brick Expressionism with the classical vertical of Gothic architecture . Construction began in 1921 but was only completed by his son Kaare Klint in 1940 after Jensen @-@ Klint 's death . The most striking feature of the building is its west facade , reminiscent of a <unk> or of the exterior of a church organ . 
 = = = Functionalism = = = 
 Functionalism , which began in the 1930s , relied on rational architecture making use of concrete , iron and glass , preferably to meet social needs . Its main proponents in Denmark were Frits Schlegel , Mogens Lassen , Vilhelm <unk> and , especially Arne Jacobsen with his <unk> developments north of Copenhagen . Another of Jacobsen 's masterpieces was the Aarhus City Hall which he designed together with Erik Møller in 1937 and completed in 1948 . The tower is 60 meters tall and the tower clock face has a diameter of 7 meters . The building is made of concrete plated with marble from Porsgrunn in Norway . 
 A more traditional approach was taken by Kay Fisker who , together with C. F. Møller , designed buildings for Aarhus University in 1931 . 
 = = = Modernism = = = 
 After World War II , Functionalism drew on trends in American Modernism with its irregular ground plans , flat roofs , open plan interiors and glass facades . Good examples are Jørn Utzon 's own family house ( 1952 ) on the outskirts of <unk> near Helsingør where good use is made of reasonably cheap materials for post @-@ war housing ; and the Kingo Houses ( 1956 – 58 ) in Helsingør which consist of 63 L @-@ shaped houses based upon the design of traditional Danish farmhouses . Another project , noted for the synthesis it creates between architecture and landscape , was the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art ( 1958 ) in Humlebæk , designed by Jørgen Bo and Vilhelm <unk> . 
 During this period , Arne Jacobsen became the country ’ s leading Modernist with the design of the SAS Hotel in Copenhagen ( 1960 ) . Rødovre Town Hall , completed in 1956 , shows how well Jacobsen combined the use of different materials : sandstone , two types of glass , painted metalwork and stainless steel . 
 Following in Jacobsen 's footsteps , Denmark had some outstanding successes in 20th @-@ century architecture . Most notably , Jørn Utzon 's iconic Sydney Opera House earned him the distinction of becoming only the second person to have his work recognized as a World Heritage Site while still alive . His <unk> Church ( 1968 – 76 ) in Copenhagen has been considered an outstanding example of critical regionalism , for the synthesis created between universal civilisation and regional culture . 
 Winning the international competition for the Grande Arche at La Défense in Paris with a design based on simple geometrical forms brought Johann Otto von <unk> international fame . Prolific Henning Larsen designed the Foreign Ministry building in Riyadh , as well as a variety of prestige buildings throughout Scandinavia , including the Copenhagen Opera House . 
 From the success of the Strøget 's transformation into a pedestrian zone in Copenhagen in the 1960s and his influential book Life Between Buildings , Jan <unk> earned an international reputation in urban design . He has advised on numerous city planning developments including those for Melbourne , London and New York . His work has often drawn on Copenhagen and its bicycle culture , to improve the quality of public space in city centres . 
 = = Contemporary period = = 
 Since the turn of the millennium , Danish architecture has flourished both at home and abroad . Two important areas of Greater Copenhagen have provided substantial opportunities for architectural developments on the domestic front while a number of firms have gained international recognition , winning important commissions abroad . For some , overseas assignments have become as important as those in Denmark itself . 
 Recent years have also seen the emergence of several new architectural firms operating both in Denmark and internationally . 
 = = = Recent urban developments = = = 
 Ørestad is a contemporary urban development to the south @-@ east of the Copenhagen 's city centre . Its origin is connected with the building of the Øresund Bridge linking Copenhagen to Malmö in Sweden , completed in 2000 . After initial planning stages in the 1990s , the first office building was realised in 2001 . Today the constantly expanding area has more than 3 @,@ 000 apartments and 192 @,@ 100 m ² of office space . 
 Copenhagen itself has also been undergoing significant transformations in recent years with the encouragement of various projects along the waterfront . Based on initial planning work in the 1980s , the area has already seen the appearance of several prestige buildings including the Black Diamond national library extension ( 1999 ) , the Opera House ( 2000 ) and the Royal Danish Playhouse ( 2004 ) . 
 = = = International presence = = = 
 Henning Larsen Architects , well established in the Nordic countries , are now active outside Denmark , particularly in the Middle East . They have a number of projects in Saudi Arabia and Syria , including the Massar Discovery Centre in Damascus . Another interesting project is a new building for Der Spiegel on the waterfront in Hamburg . 
 <unk> have designed the award @-@ winning <unk> Concert Hall in Amsterdam and the new Museum of Liverpool . In 2007 , they won a competition for the design of a new headquarters for Deutsche Bahn in Berlin ahead of firms such as Foster + Partners of the UK and Dominique Perrault of France . 
 Schmidt Hammer Lassen have opened offices in London and Oslo . In addition to numerous projects in the Nordic countries , their international work includes Westminster College in London and a new library for the University of Aberdeen . 
 Among the most notable international projects of C. F. Møller Architects are extensions to the Natural History and the National Maritime museums in London ( 2009 – 11 ) . They were also successful in being commissioned to build the Akershus University Hospital in Oslo . 
 Dissing + Weitling are widely recognized as bridge architects after completing some 220 such projects worldwide . These include the Great Belt Bridge between Sealand and Funen , the Queensferry Crossing in Scotland , the Nelson Mandela Bridge in South Africa and the Stonecutters Bridge in Hong Kong . The Great Belt suspension bridge , completed in 1998 , is the world 's third largest . With a length of 6 @,@ 790 metres ( 22 @,@ 277 ft ) and a free span of 1 @,@ 624 metres ( 5 @,@ 328 ft ) , the vertical clearance for ships is 65 metres ( 213 ft ) . 
 <unk> & <unk> are the designers of the Royal Danish Playhouse and the <unk> student housing complex , both considered to be among Copenhagen 's most successful new buildings in recent years . 
 = = = Emerging practices = = = 
 Another trend in contemporary Danish architecture is the emergence of a new generation of successful young practices , inspired more by international trends than by the modernist tradition in Scandinavia . The generation is spearheaded by Bjarke Ingels whose firm BIG ( Bjarke Ingels Group ) founded in 2006 has made an unusually rapid transition into a well @-@ established firm . 
 From the beginning , BIG received international recognition for a number of projects , including Mountain Dwellings in Ørestad . Ideologically and conceptually , the practice is more closely related to Dutch firms such as OMA – where Ingels worked from 1998 to 2001 – and <unk> than to the work of Danish architects . BIG 's major international breakthrough came in 2009 when the firm won six international competitions and gained several large commissions . These include an art museum on a cliffside overlooking Mexico City , a canalside neighbourhood in Hamburg , a new city hall for Tallinn , Estonia , a new national library for Kazakhstan , a low @-@ energy highrise project in Shenzhen , China , and a World Village for Women 's Sports in Malmö . 
 Four young practices , <unk> , COBE , Transform and <unk> , contributed to the project CO @-@ <unk> : Danish / Chinese Collaboration on Sustainable Urban Development in China , which was awarded the Golden Lion at the 2006 Venice Biennale of Architecture . The project was commissioned by the Danish Architecture Centre and curated by the Danish architect @-@ urbanist Henrik <unk> and <unk> . All four practices later went on to win high @-@ profile competitions in Denmark and abroad . <unk> has won the competition for a new building for the Estonian Art Academy in Tallinn , Transform has a project on the City Hall Square in Copenhagen and COBE has won first prize in a competition for Scandinavia 's largest sustainable district in <unk> , Copenhagen . 
 Other notable emerging Danish architectural practices include <unk> , Dorthe <unk> Architects and NORD Architects . 
 = Southern Rhodesian military involvement in the Malayan Emergency = 
 Southern Rhodesia , then a self @-@ governing colony of the United Kingdom , sent two military units to fight with the Commonwealth armed forces in the Malayan Emergency of 1948 – 60 , which pitted the Commonwealth against the Malayan National Liberation Army ( MNLA ) , the military arm of the Malayan Communist Party . For two years , starting in March 1951 , white Southern Rhodesian volunteers made up " C " Squadron of the Special Air Service ( SAS ) . The Rhodesian African Rifles , in which black rank @-@ and @-@ filers and warrant officers were led by white officers , then served in Malaya from 1956 to 1958 . 
 Of the hundreds of Southern Rhodesians who served in Malaya , eight were killed . " C " Squadron , which was formed especially to serve in Malaya , was the first SAS unit from a British colony or dominion . Several veterans of the conflict , Peter Walls and Ron Reid @-@ Daly among them , subsequently held key positions in the Rhodesian Security Forces during the Bush War of the 1970s . 
 = = Background and outbreak of war = = 
 The Malayan Emergency was a guerrilla war between the Federation of Malaya — a protectorate of Britain until August 1957 , and part of the Commonwealth of Nations thereafter — and the Malayan National Liberation Army ( MNLA ) , the armed wing of the Malayan Communist Party ( MCP ) . The MNLA sought to topple the Malayan government and force the British out , while the Commonwealth worked to prevent this . The conflict had its roots in the Second World War , in which groups of local ethnic Chinese fought alongside Britain 's limited forces in the country against the occupying Imperial Japanese ; these Malayan Chinese subscribed to communist political thinking , and called themselves the Malayan Peoples ' Anti @-@ Japanese Army . 
 Soon after Japan was defeated , the communist fighters renamed themselves the Malayan National Liberation Army , and began to agitate against British rule . Using the arms that Britain had given them — which they had cached , and then subsequently retrieved — they formed themselves into eight regiments , and began a campaign of Maoist @-@ style rural subversion , their intent being to politicise the villagers and gain popular support , which they could then use to take control of Malayan cities . In March 1948 , the MCP called on the Malayan people to rise up against the British . Three months later , on 16 June , MNLA guerrillas killed three British rubber plantation managers in Perak province . The British High Commissioner in Malaya , Sir Edward Gent , declared a state of emergency two days afterwards , marking the beginning of the Malayan Emergency . 
 In addition to British and Malayan units and personnel , the Commonwealth forces in Malaya included Australians , New Zealanders , Gurkhas , Fijians , <unk> , and Northern and Southern Rhodesians . Southern Rhodesia had been self @-@ governing since 1923 . It ran its own affairs in most matters , including defence , but it was still constitutionally bound to Whitehall insofar as foreign affairs were concerned . The Southern Rhodesian government was therefore able to exercise a large degree of independence militarily , though diplomatically it came under the British flag . 
 = = " C " Squadron , Special Air Service ( 1951 – 53 ) = = 
 The Special Air Service ( SAS ) commando unit was formed by the British Army in 1941 , during the North African Campaign of the Second World War . Including some Southern Rhodesians in its ranks , it served for the rest of the conflict , also operating in Italy and on the European Western Front . It was disbanded by the British government in October 1945 , and reinstituted in 1950 to serve in the Korean War . The situation in Korea had changed by the end of its three @-@ month training period , however , and it was sent to Malaya instead . There it was placed under the command of a British officer , Major Mike Calvert . 
 Early the following year , Calvert travelled to Southern Rhodesia on a recruitment visit . Roughly 1 @,@ 000 white Southern Rhodesians , SAS veterans among them , volunteered to go to Malaya ; from these , about 100 were chosen to form an all @-@ Southern Rhodesian unit . This was the first SAS squadron from a British colony or dominion . Led by the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Temporary Captain Peter Walls , the volunteers arrived in Malaya in March 1951 . Walls was promoted to major soon after he and his men disembarked at Singapore . The SAS already had two Squadrons , " A " and " B " , so the Southern Rhodesians became " C " Squadron , known more informally as the Rhodesian SAS . 
 Engaged largely in counter @-@ insurgency warfare , the Southern Rhodesians became well @-@ drilled in the relevant principles and doctrines . They noticeably bolstered the hitherto thinly spread ranks of the SAS in Malaya , and performed strongly in the eyes of their superiors , though British Major C L " Dare " Newell believed that their attitude towards " the aborigines " was colder than that of the British soldiers . Barbara Cole , who wrote a history of the Rhodesian SAS , says by contrast that the Rhodesians became close friends with the Fijians they served alongside , and spent far more time socialising with black and mixed @-@ race soldiers off @-@ duty than their British counterparts did . 
 In March 1953 , after serving their required two years in Malaya , the men of " C " Squadron returned home . They were replaced in 1955 by a squadron from New Zealand . Three members of " C " Squadron — Sergeant O H Ernst , and Corporals J B Davies and V E <unk> — were killed while in Malaya . For his services during the emergency , Walls was awarded an MBE . 
 = = Rhodesian African Rifles ( 1956 – 58 ) = = 
 = = = Arrival in Malaya = = = 
 Following the departure of " C " Squadron , Southern Rhodesia was uninvolved in Malaya until early 1956 , when the 1st Battalion , the Rhodesian African Rifles ( RAR ) were tasked to relieve the Northern Rhodesia Regiment ( NRR ) in Johore province . Originally formed in 1916 as the Rhodesian Native Regiment , the RAR were , by Southern Rhodesian standards , an old and well @-@ tried unit ; they fought for Britain in East Africa during the First World War , and contributed to the Burma Campaign during the Second . The regiment 's black soldiers and warrant officers , led by white officers , came from both Mashonaland and Matabeleland , with Mashonas in the majority . 
 The Royal Australian Regiment was also present in Malaya , so to prevent confusion the Rhodesian African Rifles ' acronym was temporarily changed to " RhAR " . The regiment 's advance party , made up of officers , non @-@ commissioned officers ( NCOs ) and warrant officers , left the Southern Rhodesian capital Salisbury by air on 13 February 1956 . Their tortuous route took them through Nairobi , Aden , Karachi , and RAF Negombo ( in Ceylon ) . After touching down in Singapore , the RhAR 's advance party travelled to Kluang in Johore , where they spent three weeks in jungle training with the NRR . They then redeployed to Batu Pahat , where they camped with the Fiji Infantry Regiment . A spirit of camaraderie quickly developed between the Fijian and Southern Rhodesian soldiers . The RhAR officers and NCOs continued their acclimatisation with the local environment over the following weeks , assisted by the Fijians . The rest of the battalion travelled by sea aboard SS Empire Clyde , and reached Singapore on 26 April 1956 . Soon after , the RhAR set up headquarters at <unk> , about 130 kilometres ( 81 mi ) north @-@ west of the port city . 
 = = = MNLA and RhAR tactics = = = 
 By this stage of the insurgency , the MNLA had largely split into small groups of guerrillas , which existed by basing themselves in a chosen rural area , subverting local villagers and accumulating from them manpower and supplies . The lot of any security forces posted nearby was to play a constant game of hide @-@ and @-@ seek with the communists , whereby the army would indefinitely search for and destroy any base camps and food caches the MNLA set up . The Commonwealth leaders surmised that the MNLA could not possibly resist such a campaign forever , and would , in time , simply give up attempting to regroup . 
 In Malaya , the RhAR comprised A , B , C and D Companies , each of which was split into three 32 @-@ man platoons . The white lieutenant commanding each platoon carried the weapon of his choice , usually a shotgun or an FN FAL battle rifle , and acted with the assistance of a black platoon sergeant and a black warrant officer . Under the lieutenant , three black corporals led a rifle section each . These consisted of the section leader ( generally armed with a shotgun ) , a scout , a Bren gunner , a <unk> @-@ Sterling machine @-@ gunner , and up to seven FN FAL riflemen . When marching through thick jungle , an RhAR patrol moved in single file , with each trooper 5 metres ( 16 ft ) behind the man in front . The warrant officer followed close behind the lieutenant , ready to take over command if necessary , with the radio operator and medic with him . The platoon sergeant made up the rear . According to Second Lieutenant John Essex @-@ Clark , an Australian @-@ born officer who led an RhAR platoon in Malaya , these Southern Rhodesian units moved much faster in jungle conditions than those made up of British men . The black Southern Rhodesian soldiers were reportedly naturals when it came to tracking ; many of them came from rural backgrounds , and had acquired relevant instincts and skills while growing up . 
 = = = RhAR operations in Malaya = = = 
 The RhAR patrolled around Johore from May to September 1956 without major incident . The rain of the Malayan monsoon season seemed endless to many of the battalion 's men , and actual sightings of the communists were rare in the extreme . Even when the guerrillas were spotted , they almost invariably fled after a few shots . " We can but hope that the chaps will get a chance of seeing a CT [ communist terrorist ] for a change , " reported an RhAR officer in August ; " they are all as keen as mustard to come to blows with them . " So determined were the RhAR 's officers and men to come face to face with the enemy that they ambushed around the railway line at Bekok for seven nights in a row , starting on 30 October 1956 . Patrols were led by a different officer each night , but there were no contacts . 
 Around this time the British Royal Lincolnshire Regiment , operating in the <unk> area , about 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) north @-@ west of Bekok , reported to the RhAR that they had encountered the communist 32 Independent Platoon , led by Hor Lung , which was then heading south @-@ east towards the <unk> River . The RhAR therefore redeployed to intercept Hor Lung 's men . On 9 November , a half @-@ section of Southern Rhodesians led by Corporal <unk> sighted 16 pack @-@ laden guerrillas , marching east . On his own initiative , <unk> attacked , catching the communists by surprise ; the insurgents split up and fled , running in all directions . One fighter attempted to hide behind a tree , but was killed by RhAR rifle fire . 
 On 17 November , the RhAR was withdrawn for a period of rest and recuperation ( R & R ) . The battalion 's Transport Platoon was ambushed by communist guerrillas as it was returning to base : a shot through the windscreen of one of the two trucks nearly hit its driver , but the convoy was able to escape the ambush without anybody being injured . On 26 November , the RhAR and the King 's Own Scottish Borderers assisted the local police at <unk> <unk> in an action called Tartan Rock : the security forces moved into the village and arrested 34 communist sympathisers , most of whom were ethnic Chinese students from the University of Malaya in Singapore . Two days later , the RhAR were back on regular duty . 
 Starting in February 1957 , the RhAR took part in Operations Cobble and Shoe . These were " food denial " operations , whereby efforts to deny supplies to the communists were to be redoubled . Patrols around the rubber plantations and the edges of the jungle were intensified . To prevent guerrilla supplies from north of the <unk> River from reaching the food denial areas to the south , covered by Operation Cobble , an RhAR platoon under Lieutenant David Heppenstall was posted to the area directly south of the river midway through the month . This action lasted from 21 February to 4 April 1957 . There were few contacts , and only one communist was killed by Heppenstall 's men , but a great deal of intelligence was secured regarding guerrilla organisation and supply routes . 
 Over the next few months , RhAR patrols in the <unk> , Labis , Bekok and Sungai Karas areas were stepped up to last between 10 and 18 days each , but contacts with the communist forces remained rare . The constant patrols gradually began to take their toll on the insurgents , and guerrillas began to give themselves up increasingly frequently . A contributing factor here was Britain 's granting of independence to Malaya within the Commonwealth on 31 August 1957 , which dented the motivation of many fighters . Starting in October 1957 , the RhAR were tasked to work alongside former MNLA personnel to wipe out any remaining communist forces in the region . The ex @-@ insurgents were supposed to lead the security forces to MNLA camps and resting places , but this strategy was not successful . The RhAR soon developed a low opinion of these ex @-@ MNLA men . 
 As it approached the end of its two @-@ year commitment in Malaya , the RhAR continued its patrolling in Johore province without major incident until February 1958 , when it returned to Rhodesia . Five of the regiment 's number had been killed over the previous two years : Corporal <unk> , and Privates Joseph , <unk> , Manuel and <unk> . 
 = = Influence on the Rhodesian Bush War = = 
 Several veterans of Malaya proceeded to hold key positions in the Rhodesian Security Forces during the Rhodesian Bush War of the 1970s , most prominently Walls and another member of " C " Squadron , Ron Reid @-@ Daly . Walls reformed the all @-@ white Rhodesian Light Infantry ( RLI ) into a commando battalion similar to the SAS during the mid @-@ 1960s , with Reid @-@ Daly serving under him as regimental sergeant major . After leaving the RLI in 1967 , Walls became head of the Rhodesian Army in 1972 , and retained this role for the rest of the Bush War . Reid @-@ Daly , meanwhile , formed and commanded the Selous Scouts pseudo @-@ guerrilla regiment from 1973 . The Selous Scouts concept was influenced by similar operations conducted by Special Branch in Malaya . Both the Rhodesian African Rifles and the Rhodesian SAS endured following Malaya , and served in the Bush War . 
 The South African historian <unk> Cilliers , writing about the Rhodesian Bush War , comments on the gulf between what he calls the " Malaya clique " and those lower @-@ ranking Rhodesian soldiers in the field , the latter of whom underestimated the threat posed by the nationalist campaigns , having not previously encountered an insurgency situation . From the mid @-@ 1970s , officers such as Walls attempted to impress upon their contemporaries the similarity between the Rhodesian situation and the one they had experienced in Malaya . Operations in Malaya had been coordinated nationally , while in Rhodesia the Army , Air Force and Police were sometimes at odds with each other . To resolve this the Rhodesians created a supreme body called Combined Operations in 1977 , influenced by similar posts in Malaya , with Walls at its head .

 " Beat It " is a song written and performed by American singer Michael Jackson and produced by Quincy Jones ( with co @-@ production by Jackson ) . It is the third single from the singer 's sixth solo album , Thriller ( 1982 ) . Eddie Van Halen played the song 's distinctive overdriven guitar solo . While Van Halen was prevented by his record label from appearing in the music video , he did appear on stage with Jackson in Dallas during the Jackson brothers Victory Tour . Following the successful chart performances of the Thriller singles " The Girl Is Mine " and " Billie Jean " , " Beat It " was released on February 3 , 1983 as the album 's third single . The song was promoted with a short film that featured Jackson bringing two gangs together through the power of music and dance . 
 " Beat It " received the Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Best Male Rock Vocal Performance , as well as two American Music Awards . It was inducted into the Music Video Producers Hall of Fame . The single , along with its music video , propelled Thriller into becoming the best @-@ selling album of all time . The single was certified platinum in the United States in 1989 . Rolling Stone placed " Beat It " on the 344th spot of its list of " The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time " . The song was also ranked number 81 on Rolling Stone 's " 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time " . 
 In the decades since its release , " Beat It " has been covered , parodied , and sampled by numerous artists including Pierce the Veil , Fall Out Boy , <unk> , Justin Bieber , Alvin and the Chipmunks , Fergie , John 5 , " Weird Al " Yankovic and Eminem . The song was also featured in the National Highway Safety Commission 's anti @-@ drunk driving campaign . 
 = = Production and composition = = 
 " Beat It " was composed by Michael Jackson for his Thriller album . Producer Quincy Jones had wanted to include a rock and roll song in the vein of the Knack 's " My Sharona " , though Jackson reportedly had never previously shown an interest in the genre . Jackson later said of " Beat It " , " I wanted to write a song , the type of song that I would buy if I were to buy a rock song ... That is how I approached it and I wanted the children to really enjoy it — the school children as well as the college students . " Jermaine Jackson has suggested the inspiration of " Beat It " and its video came from the Jackson family experiencing gang activity in Gary , Indiana . " From our front window , we witnessed , about three bad rumbles between rival gangs . " 
 Upon hearing the first recorded vocals , Jones stated that it was exactly what he was looking for . The song begins with seven distinct synthesizer notes played on the Synclavier digital synthesizer , while Tom Bahler is credited with Synclavier performance on the song . The intro is taken note for note from a demo LP released the year before , called " The Incredible Sounds of Synclavier II " first published in 1981 by Denny Jaeger Creative Services , Inc and sold by New England Digital , makers of the Synclavier . 
 Eddie Van Halen , lead guitarist of hard rock band Van Halen , was asked to add a guitar solo . When initially contacted by Jones , Van Halen thought he was receiving a prank call . Having established that the call was genuine , Van Halen recorded his guitar solo free of any charge . " I did it as a favor " , the musician later said . " I was a complete fool , according to the rest of the band , our manager and everyone else . I was not used . I knew what I was doing – I don 't do something unless I want to do it . " Van Halen recorded his contribution following Jones and Jackson arriving at the guitarist 's house with a " skeleton version " of the song . Fellow guitarist Steve Lukather recalled , " Initially , we rocked it out as Eddie had played a good solo — but Quincy thought it was too tough . So I had to reduce the distorted guitar sound and that is what was released . " The song was among the last four completed for Thriller ; the others were " Human Nature " , " P.Y.T. ( Pretty Young Thing ) " and " The Lady in My Life " . 
 On the record , right before Van Halen 's guitar solo begins , a noise is heard that sounds like somebody knocking at a door . It is reported that the knock was a person walking into Eddie 's recording studio . Another story has claimed that the sound was simply the musician knocking on his own guitar . The sound , however , is that of Jackson knocking on a drum case , as he is credited in the album 's liner notes . 
 The engineers were shocked during the recording of Van Halen 's solo to discover that the sound of his guitar had caused the monitor speaker in the control room to catch fire , causing one to exclaim , " This must be REALLY good ! " 
 The lyrics of " Beat It " are about defeat and courage , and have been described as a " sad commentary on human nature " . The line " don 't be a macho man " is said to express Jackson 's dislike of violence , whilst also referring to the childhood abuse he faced at the hands of his father Joseph . The song is played in the key of D ♯ minor at a moderately fast tempo of 132 beats per minute . In the song , Jackson 's vocal range is B3 to D5 . 
 Drums on the song were played by Toto co @-@ founder Jeff Porcaro . 
 A remix of " 2 Bad " , is featured on Blood on the Dance Floor : HIStory in the Mix containing a sample of " Beat It " as well as a rap by John Forté and guitar solo by Wyclef Jean .

 " Beat It " was released on February 14 , 1983 , following the successful chart performances of " The Girl Is Mine " and " Billie Jean " . Frank DiLeo , the vice president of Epic Records , convinced Jackson to release " Beat It " whilst " Billie Jean " was heading towards No. 1 . Dileo , who would later become the singer 's manager , predicted that both singles would remain in the Top 10 at the same time . " Billie Jean " remained atop the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks , before being toppled by " Come On Eileen " . The Dexys Midnight Runners ' song stayed at No. 1 for a single week , before Jackson reclaimed the position with " Beat It " . 
 " Billie Jean " and " Beat It " occupied Top 5 positions at the same time , a feat matched by very few artists . The single remained at the top of the Hot 100 for a total of three weeks . The song also charted at No. 1 on the US R & B singles chart and No. 14 on the Billboard Top Tracks chart in the US . Billboard ranked it at the No. 5 song for 1983 . " Beat It " also claimed the top spot in Spain and The Netherlands , reached No. 3 in the UK and the Top 20 in Austria , Norway , Italy , Sweden and Switzerland . 
 In a Rolling Stone review , Christopher Connelly describes " Beat It " as the best song on Thriller , adding that it " ain 't no disco AOR track " . He notes of the " nifty dance song " , " Jackson 's voice soars all over the melody , Eddie Van Halen checks in with a blistering guitar solo , you could build a convention center on the backbeat " . AllMusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine states that the song is both " tough " and " scared " . Robert Christgau claimed that the song has Eddie Van Halen " wielding his might in the service of <unk> " . Slant Magazine observed that the song was an " uncharacteristic dalliance with the rock idiom " . The track also won praise from Jackson biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli , who stated that the song was " rambunctious " . 
 " Beat It " has been recognized with several awards . At the 1984 Grammy Awards , the song earned Jackson two of a record @-@ eight awards : Record of the Year and Best Male Rock Vocal Performance . The track won the Billboard Music Award for favorite dance / disco 12 " LP in 1983 . The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , a few months after its release , for shipments of at least one million units . In 1989 , the standard format single was re @-@ certified platinum by the RIAA , based on the revised sales level of one million units for platinum singles . The total number of digital sales in the US , as of September 2010 , stands at 1 @,@ 649 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Music video = = 
 The music video for " Beat It " helped establish Jackson as an international pop icon . The video was Jackson 's first treatment of black youth and the streets . Both " Beat It " and " Thriller " are notable for their " mass choreography " of synchronized dancers , a Jackson trademark . 
 The video , which cost Jackson $ 150 @,@ 000 to create after CBS refused to finance it , was filmed on Los Angeles ' Skid Row — mainly on locations on East 5th Street — around March 9 , 1983 . To add authenticity to the production but also to foster peace between them , Jackson had the idea to cast members of rival Los Angeles street gangs Crips and Bloods . In addition to around 80 genuine gang members , the video , which is noted for opening up many job opportunities for dancers in the US , also featured 18 professional dancers and four breakdancers . Besides Jackson , Peters and Vincent Paterson , the cast included Michael <unk> , Stoney Jackson , Tracii Guns , Tony Fields , Peter <unk> , Rick Stone and Cheryl Song . 
 The video was written and directed by Bob Giraldi , produced by Antony Payne and Mary M. Ensign through production company <unk> . The second video released for the Thriller album , it was choreographed by Michael Peters who also performed , alongside Vincent Paterson , as one of the two lead dancers . Despite some sources claiming otherwise , Jackson was involved in creating some parts of the choreography . Jackson asked Giraldi , at the time already an established commercial director but who had never directed a music video , to come up with a concept for the " Beat It " video because he really liked a commercial Giraldi had directed for WLS @-@ TV in Chicago about a married couple of two elderly blind people who instead of running from a run @-@ down neighborhood all the other white people had fled from , chose to stay and throw a block party for all the young children in the area . Contrary to popular belief , the concept of the video was not based on the Broadway musical West Side Story ; in reality Giraldi drew inspiration from his growing up in Paterson , New Jersey . 
 The video had its world premiere on MTV during prime time on March 31 , 1983 though it should be noted that neither Beat It nor Billie Jean was , as is often claimed , the first music video by an African @-@ American artist to be played on MTV . Soon after its premiere the video was also running on other video programs including BET 's Video Soul , <unk> WTBS 's Night Tracks , and NBC 's Friday Night Videos . In fact , Beat It was the first video shown on the latter 's first ever telecast on July 29 , 1983 . 
 The video opens with the news of a fight circulating at a diner . This scene repeats itself at a pool hall , where gang members arrive via foot , forklift , and out of sewers , while the video 's titular song begins to play . The camera cuts to a scene of Jackson lying on a bed , revealing he 's the one singing contemplating the senseless violence . The singer notices rival gangs and leaves . Michael Jackson dons a red leather J. Parks brand jacket , and dances his way towards the fight through the diner and pool hall . A knife fight is taking place between the two gang leaders in a warehouse . They dance battle for an interlude of music until MJ arrives ; the singer breaks up the fight and launches into a dance routine . The video ends with the gang members joining him in the dance , agreeing that violence is not the solution to their problems . 
 The video received recognition through numerous awards . The American Music Awards named the short film their Favorite Pop / Rock Video and their Favorite Soul Video . The Black Gold Awards honored Jackson with the Best Video Performance award . The Billboard Video Awards recognised the video with 7 awards ; Best Overall Video Clip , Best Performance by a Male Artist , Best Use of Video to Enhance a Song , Best Use of Video to Enhance an Artist 's Image , Best Choreography , Best Overall Video and Best Dance / Disco 12 " . The short film was ranked by Rolling Stone as the No. 1 video , in both their critic 's and reader 's poll . The video was later inducted into the Music Video Producer 's Hall of Fame . 
 The music video of the song appears on the video albums : Video Greatest Hits – HIStory , HIStory on Film , Volume II , Number Ones , on the bonus DVD of Thriller 25 and Michael Jackson 's Vision .

" Why ? " , she queried .

 In early 2008 it was announced that Fall Out Boy were to cover " Beat It " for their Live in Phoenix album . The band had previously performed the song at venues such as Coors Amphitheatre and festivals such as the Carling Weekend in Leeds . Bassist Pete Wentz , who has claimed to have an obsession with Jackson , stated that prior to recording the song , he would only watch Moonwalker . It was also announced that John Mayer was to add the guitar solo previously played by Eddie Van Halen . 
 The band 's lead singer / guitarist Patrick Stump stated that the band had not planned to cover the song . " Basically , I just started playing the riff in sound @-@ check one day , and then we all started playing it , and then we started playing it live , and then we figured we 'd record it and put it out with our live DVD . " Bassist Pete Wentz added that the band had not originally intended for the song to be released as a single either . " ' Beat It ' seemed like a song that would be cool and that we could do our own take on " , he said . Having spent time deciding on a guitarist for the song , Wentz eventually called John Mayer to add the guitar solo . " We were trying to think about who is a contemporary guitar guy who 's going to go down as a legend " , Wentz later noted . 
 Upon its digital release as a single in April 2008 , Fall Out Boy 's cover of " Beat It " became a mainstay on iTunes ' Top 10 chart . The song peaked at No. 8 in Canada , becoming another top 10 hit in the region . It also charted at No. 13 in Australia , No. 14 in New Zealand , No. 75 in Austria and No. 98 in the Netherlands .

 The music video for Fall Out Boy 's " Beat It " was directed by Shane Drake and was made in homage to Jackson . " I think when you 're doing a Michael Jackson cover , there 's this expectation that you 're going to do one of his videos verbatim , " Stump said . " What we decided to do was kind of inspired by Michael Jackson and the mythology of him . There are specific images that are reference points for us , but at any given point , it 's not any of his videos . It 's kind of all of his videos , all at once , but on a Fall Out Boy budget , so it 's not quite as fancy . " The costumes for the video were similar to the originals . " My costume is this take on one of the guys from Michael Jackson 's original ' Beat It ' video , like , the guy who plays the rival dancer , " Wentz said during the filming of the video . The music video featured numerous cameos , including a karate class / dance session being taught by Tony Hale , Donald Faison and Joel David Moore dressed up like Michael Jackson . The short film later received a MTV Video Music Award nomination for Best Rock Video .
