 No. 5 Elementary Flying Training School ( No. 5 EFTS ) was a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) pilot training unit that operated during World War II . It was one of twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia 's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme . No. 5 EFTS was established in June 1940 at Narromine , New South Wales , and primarily operated Tiger Moths . It ceased training in June 1944 , after more than 3 @,@ 700 students had passed through . 
 = = History = = 
 Flying instruction in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World War II , in response to a vast increase in the number of aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia 's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme ( EATS ) . The Air Force 's pre @-@ war pilot training facility , No. 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook , Victoria , was supplanted in 1940 – 41 by twelve elementary flying training schools ( EFTS ) and eight service flying training schools ( SFTS ) . The EFTS provided a twelve @-@ week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF 's initial training schools . Flying training was undertaken in two stages : the first involved four weeks of instruction ( including ten hours of flying ) to determine trainees ' suitability to become pilots . Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training ( including sixty @-@ five hours of flying ) at the EFTS . Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators . 
 No. 5 Elementary Flying Training School ( No. 5 EFTS ) was formed at Narromine , New South Wales , on 24 May 1940 , and came under the control of Central Area Command , headquartered in Sydney . Its inaugural commanding officer was Squadron Leader T.C. Curnow , who was previously in charge of No. 2 Elementary Flying Training School at Archerfield , Queensland . No. 5 EFTS 's airfield had been home to the Narromine Aero Club before being taken over by the RAAF . Twenty de Havilland Tiger Moth training aircraft were flown in from Laverton , Victoria , on 24 June , and flying training commenced three days later when the first forty @-@ six students arrived from No. 1 Initial Training School . Within a month , student numbers had grown to ninety @-@ four , and the school 's total strength was 346 . 
 As of 30 June 1940 , only one of the No. 5 EFTS 's four required hangars had been completed . Accommodation facilities were , according to the unit operations book , " bleak and depressing " and deficiencies in equipment were " too numerous for <unk> " . The primitive conditions meant that personnel suffered adverse health effects from the cold in winter and hot , dusty conditions in the summer . Flying at Narromine was also hampered by bad weather , particularly heavy rain and wind . Accidents were frequent at all EFTSs , though fatalities were rare . An instructor and his passenger from No. 5 EFTS were killed when a Tiger Moth crashed on 3 August 1940 , possibly caused by a stall while practising forced landings . By the end of August , the school was operating one of its two required Link Trainer simulators . 
 As of 30 September 1940 , total strength was 467 , including 114 trainees . One student died and five others were injured off duty when the balcony of the Federal Hotel in Narromine collapsed on 11 November . An instructor was killed and his pupil injured when their Tiger Moth stalled while attempting to avoid collision with another aircraft on 3 December . Later that month , Squadron Leader Roy King , a fighter ace in the Australian Flying Corps during World War I , took over command of the school , serving until June 1941 . By that time , some 500 pupils had graduated from No. 5 EFTS ; the wastage rate was just under twenty per cent . Among the graduates was R.H. ( Ron ) Middleton , who subsequently flew with the Royal Air Force in Europe and was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his actions piloting a Short Stirling bomber in November 1942 . 
 Night @-@ flying training commenced at No. 5 EFTS in July 1941 . As of 30 April 1942 , the school 's strength was 845 personnel , including 319 students , the increase owing to an influx of staff and students from No. 2 EFTS and No. 6 Elementary Flying Training School in Tamworth , New South Wales , both of which had been disbanded in March . By July 1943 , total strength stood at 748 , including thirty @-@ three members of the Women 's Auxiliary Australian Air Force ( WAAAF ) ; the unit was operating eighty @-@ seven Tiger Moths and one Ryan . In April 1944 , WAAAF numbers reached eighty @-@ four out of a total strength of 703 ; the aircraft complement was eighty @-@ six Tiger Moths , seventy @-@ one of which were serviceable , and two CAC Wacketts , neither serviceable . No. 48 Course passed out on 15 June 1944 , after which training at the school ceased . Three other courses then under way were completed at other EFTSs . By 25 June , all of the school 's Tiger Moths had been transferred to other locations . A total of 3 @,@ 734 students had passed through No. 5 EFTS , 2 @,@ 850 of whom graduated as pilots .

 = French ironclad Trident = 
 The French ironclad Trident was the second and last ship of the Colbert @-@ class ironclads that were built for the French Navy in the 1870s . The ship was the flagship of the deputy commander of the Mediterranean Squadron for most of her career . She took part in the French occupation of Tunisia , notably shelling and landing troops in Sfax in 1881 . Trident was reclassified as a training ship in 1894 and condemned in 1900 , before she was finally sold for scrap in 1909 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Colbert @-@ class ships were designed by Constructor Sabattier as improved versions of the ironclad Richelieu . As a central battery ironclad , Trident had her armament concentrated amidships . Like most ironclads of her era she was equipped with a plough @-@ shaped ram . Her crew numbered 774 officers and men . The metacentric height of the ship was low , a little above 0 @.@ 6 meters ( 2 ft ) . 
 The ship measured 102 @.@ 1 meters ( 335 ft 0 in ) overall , with a beam of 17 @.@ 7 meters ( 58 ft 1 in ) . Trident had a maximum draft of 8 @.@ 58 meters ( 28 ft 2 in ) and displaced 8 @,@ 814 metric tons ( 8 @,@ 675 long tons ) . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Trident had a single Wolf three @-@ cylinder horizontal return connecting @-@ rod compound steam engine that drove one propeller . The engine was powered by eight oval boilers and was designed for a capacity of 4 @,@ 600 indicated horsepower ( 3 @,@ 400 kW ) . On sea trials , the engine produced 4 @,@ 882 metric horsepower ( 3 @,@ 591 kW ) and Trident reached 14 @.@ 18 knots ( 26 @.@ 26 km / h ; 16 @.@ 32 mph ) . She carried a maximum of 620 metric tons ( 610 long tons ) of coal which allowed her to steam for approximately 3 @,@ 300 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 100 km ; 3 @,@ 800 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Trident was ship rigged with three masts and had a sail area around 2 @,@ 100 square meters ( 23 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Trident had two 274 @-@ millimeter ( 10 @.@ 8 in ) guns mounted in barbettes on the upper deck , one gun at the forward corners of the battery , with six additional guns on the battery deck below the barbettes . The side of the upper deck were cut away to improve the ability of the barbette guns to bear fore and aft . One 240 @-@ millimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) was mounted in the forecastle as a chase gun . The ship 's secondary armament consisted of six 138 @-@ millimeter ( 5 @.@ 4 in ) guns , four forward of the battery and two aft . These latter two guns were replaced in 1878 by another 240 @-@ millimeter gun as a stern chaser . The ship also mounted four above @-@ water 356 @-@ millimeter ( 14 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes . 
 All of the ship 's guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells . The 274 @-@ millimeter Modèle 1870 gun was credited with the ability to penetrate a maximum 14 @.@ 3 inches ( 360 mm ) of wrought iron armor while the 240 @-@ millmeter Modèle 1870 gun could penetrate 14 @.@ 4 inches ( 366 mm ) of wrought iron armor . 
 At some point the ship received fourteen to eighteen 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss 5 @-@ barrel revolving guns . They fired a shell weighing about 500 g ( 1 @.@ 1 lb ) to a range of about 3 @,@ 200 meters ( 3 @,@ 500 yd ) . They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute .

 Trident , named after the weapon that symbolized mastery of the seas , was laid down in April 1870 in Toulon and launched on 9 November 1876 . While the exact reason for such prolonged construction time is not known , it is believed that reduction of the French Navy 's budget after the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1870 – 71 and out @-@ of @-@ date work practices in French dockyards were likely causes . The ship was completed on 1 November 1878 and became the flagship of the second @-@ in @-@ command of the Mediterranean Squadron the following month . Trident , together with her sister ship Colbert , bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax on 15 – 16 July 1881 as the French occupied Tunisia . She was disarmed and placed in reserve in 1886 – 89 , but was recommissioned on 17 February 1889 and resumed her role as flagship until she was again placed in reserve in 1894 . The ship served as a gunnery training ship until she was condemned on 5 March 1900 . Trident was renamed Var in 1904 and was sold for scrap five years later . 
 = 1994 Pacific typhoon season = 
 The 1994 Pacific typhoon season was an extremely active season in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation in the Western North Pacific , with a total of 41 tropical cyclones during the course of the season . The season had no official bounds and it ran year @-@ round in 1994 , but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November . Tropical storms that formed west of the date line were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center . The World Meteorological Organization @-@ designated Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre for tropical cyclones for the region is the Japan Meteorological Agency . Tropical depressions that entered or formed in the Philippine area of responsibility were assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA . This resulted in some storms having two names . 
 The season started on January 4 with the formation of Tropical Depression 01W to the west of Yap , with the first tropical storm developing a few months later on April 1 , and ended near the end of the year when Tropical Storm Bobbie dissipated in the open Pacific on December 25 . During the season , 25 systems either threatened land or made landfall , killing over 2 @,@ 400 people . The strongest storm of the season was Super Typhoon Doug , which affected Taiwan , South Korea and mainland China , while the deadliest storm was Super Typhoon Fred , which killed over 1 @,@ 000 people in China . Earlier in the season , the combined effects of two tropical storms — Russ and Sharon — caused flooding in China that killed over 1 @,@ 400 . The season also saw two storms , Li and John , cross into the Western North Pacific from the east , while one storm , Tropical Storm Yuri , formed from a precursor low that had similarly crossed the International Date Line . This season , PAGASA named 25 systems and had to use an auxiliary list to name some of them after running out of names from their standard list . Of the 25 , three systems were not tracked by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 There were 41 tropical cyclones during 1994 in the Western North Pacific ; 39 formed within the area while two , Tropical Storm Li and Typhoon John , formed in the Eastern North Pacific ( east of longitude 140 ° W ) and crossed the date line to enter this basin . Of the 39 , 34 became tropical storms and were named , of which 17 became typhoons . The season started on January 4 with the formation of Tropical Depression One @-@ W to the west of Yap , with the first tropical storm developing a few months later on April 1 . The season ended late in the year after Tropical Storm Bobbie dissipated in the open Pacific on December 25 . 
 During the season , 25 systems either threatened land or made landfall , with eight striking the Philippines , eight moving into China , six moving into Vietnam , and three striking Taiwan and China . A total of over 2 @,@ 400 people perished during the season . The strongest storm of the season was Super Typhoon Doug , which affected Taiwan , South Korea and mainland China , while the deadliest storm was Super Typhoon Fred , which killed over 1 @,@ 000 people in China . Earlier in the season , the combined effects of two tropical storms — Russ and Sharon — caused flooding in China that killed over 1 @,@ 400 . The season also saw two storms , Li and John , cross into the Western North Pacific from the east , while one storm , Tropical Storm Yuri , formed from a precursor low that had similarly crossed the International Date Line . Hong Kong received 28 percent of its annual rainfall from tropical cyclones this season , which was slightly above normal . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Tropical Depression 01W ( Akang ) = = = 
 The first tropical depression of the year was first observed as a poorly organised area of clouds , within a trough of low pressure near the Caroline Islands during January 1 . The system subsequently moved towards the north @-@ northwest , while atmospheric convection surrounding the system organized further . As a result of this organization and a weather station on Chuuk island reporting wind speeds of 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) , the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system during January 2 . However the system did not become a significant tropical cyclone during January 3 , as it was not able to sustain its convective organization . The system was subsequently classified as a tropical depression on January 4 while the system was about 600 km , ( 370 mi ) , west of Yap . 
 Tropical Depression 01W made landfall on Samar Island in the Philippines on the evening of January 5 , following which the depression started to weaken . The final warning was issued early on January 6 after the system lost all its deep convection . A total of 35 to 45 deaths were reported , with over 69 million Philippine pesos ( 1994 pesos ) or $ 2 @.@ 4 million ( 1994 USD ) in damage reported . It caused a major flood event in the Philippines . A total of at least 16 @,@ 000 people had to take refuge in government @-@ run shelters during and after the storm . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Owen ( Bising ) = = = 
 Typhoon Owen formed from a tropical disturbance which was originally identified within a near @-@ equatorial trough over Micronesia . The disturbance was first mentioned by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center on March 29 . By March 31 , a distinct area within the trough showing signs of cyclonic spin appeared , and the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 02W soon afterwards . Meanwhile , the Japan Meteorological Agency classified the system as a tropical storm , Tropical Storm <unk> . It was located about 420 kilometres ( 260 mi ) west @-@ northwest of Yap . 
 Owen continued to strengthen , with the JMA classifying it a severe tropical storm on April 3 . According to the JTWC , Owen reached typhoon intensity at the same time the JMA classified it a severe tropical storm . The storm tracked southwest to west @-@ southwestward , and reached its peak intensity of 75 knots ( 139 km / h ) from the JTWC ( 60 knots ( 110 km / h ) from the JMA ) on April 4 , shortly before landfall between Leyte and Mindanao . A reading taken late on April 3 at Guiuan on Samar reported sustained winds of 45 knots ( 83 km / h ) . It weakened to a tropical storm overland , before it restrengthened slightly after emerging into the South China Sea . A drilling rig reported 50 knots ( 93 km / h ) sustained winds . Soon afterwards , the cyclone dissipated over water northwest of Luzon on April 9 . 
 Owen 's west @-@ southwestward track shortly before landfall was rare . Owen was one of just two April typhoons in the previous 36 years — the other being Typhoon Wanda of the 1971 season - to make landfall while moving west @-@ southwestward . Owen 's later recurvature in the South China Sea was also unusual ; it recurved at a latitude of only about 13 ° N , about 3 ° south of the average latitude for recurvature in the South China Sea in April . 
 Owen 's impact on the Philippines was widespread , with nine provinces being declared under a " state of calamity " by President of the Philippines Fidel Ramos . At least 10 people were killed with 5 others missing , and a further 14 fishermen feared drowned . A total of 33 were reported wounded . Over 9000 families were affected by Owen . No damage was reported to the drilling rig in the South China Sea . 
 In Okinawa , heavy rains were reported on Yonaguni , with a total reported precipitation amount of 313 millimetres ( 12 @.@ 3 in ) . The peak winds measured at Yonaguni in association with Typhoon Owen were 32 @.@ 4 kilometres per hour ( 17 @.@ 5 kn ) .

 On May 8 , a large increase in deep convection associated with near @-@ equatorial troughs was noted in the eastern Caroline Islands . By the next morning , visible satellite imagery showed an increase in organization of the deep convection associated with the system , and synoptic reports from buoys confirmed that a low @-@ level circulation centre was present near 5 ° N 153 ° E. Slow development ensued , and the system was upgraded to a tropical depression on May 12 . At the same time , the Japan Meteorological Agency began tracking the system , about 510 kilometres ( 320 mi ) west @-@ southwest of Guam . 
 Page moved on a northwestward track for the next couple days while slowly strengthening . Page was upgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC late on May 12 , when it was located 500 kilometres ( 310 mi ) north of Yap , while the JMA first considered the system a tropical storm on May 13 . Late on May 13 , Page suddenly slowed in forward speed and began turning to the northeast . On May 14 , Page became a typhoon . However , the JMA did not follow suit until 30 hours later . Page reached its maximum intensity of 90 knots ( 170 km / h ) and minimum pressure of 965 hectopascals ( 28 @.@ 5 inHg ) thirty hours after passing the point of recurvature . Final warnings were issued by both the JTWC and the JMA early on May 18 , as it began extratropical transition around 960 kilometres ( 600 mi ) east @-@ southeast of Tokyo . 
 Page had the largest average track forecast errors of all the typhoons in 1994 , mainly due to failures in expecting its recurvature . Furthermore , Page 's late attainment of maximum intensity , at 30 hours after point of recurvature , is not common . Between 1978 and 1993 , only seven of 77 typhoons attained peak intensity more than 24 hours after recurving . 
 Large waves and high tides generated by Page affected the western Mariana Islands . A few tourists had to be rescued from high surf and strong currents on Guam . Minimal rainfall was recorded in Japan , the highest recorded total was 29 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 1 in ) in Kumagaya , Saitama . At Mount Tsukuba , a maximum sustained wind speed of 58 kilometres per hour ( 31 kn ) was recorded . 
 = = = Tropical Depression 04W ( Deling ) = = = 
 On May 14 , an area of deep convection associated with a weak cyclonic circulation near Kosrae was mentioned in the JTWC 's 0600 UTC Significant Tropical Weather Advisory . For the next five days , this weak circulation tracked west @-@ northwestward in the direction of Guam , before turning to the west @-@ southwest , but convection failed to consolidate near the centre during this time . After passing close to Palau on May 21 , it turned northwest and entered the Philippine Sea , and was named Deling by PAGASA early on May 23 local time . Shortly after , SSM / I imagery indicated the presence of a well @-@ defined low @-@ level circulation centre , and visible and infrared satellite images indicated an increase in organisation of the system and a consolidation of deep convection near the centre . Based on this , a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued by the JTWC at 0600 UTC . 
 The first warning was issued a day later when the amount of deep convection near the centre increased as the depression neared the Philippines . While over the Philippine islands , a large Mesoscale Convective System ( MCS ) developed near the centre of the tropical depression , something that would occur again later while the system was west of Luzon . Soon after the second MCS weakened , the system made landfall in central Vietnam on May 26 , and quickly dissipated when inland . The Hong Kong Observatory tracked this system as a weak tropical depression from May 25 UTC when it was about 520 km ( 320 mi ) southeast of <unk> for about 24 hours before it dissipated . 
 According to press reports , over 2 @,@ 000 people were forced to evacuate from Davao City , despite no reports of significantly high winds or low pressures , as the system caused heavy rainfall that produced heavy flooding that killed five people and left at least one person missing . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Storm Russ ( Emang ) = = = 
 Tropical Storm Russ was one of just three storms to cause the Hong Kong Observatory to raise Tropical Cyclone Signal # 3 in the 1994 season . Russ was first spotted on June 2 , about 140 kilometres ( 87 mi ) east of Hainan Island as a tropical disturbance . Deep convection over the circulation center soon improved , and the Hong Kong Observatory had declared it a tropical depression on June 3 when it was located about 290 kilometres ( 180 mi ) south of Hong Kong . 
 The system initially moved east to northeast while slowly strengthening . Russ became a tropical storm on the evening of June 4 , passing just south of Dongsha that night . PAGASA then named the system Emang , shortly before it made a clockwise loop and started to move back towards the west @-@ southwest , intensifying . Russ made landfall on June 8 on the northeastern Luichow Peninsula , and dissipated inland . 
 The maximum wind gust in Hong Kong was reported at Tai Mo Shan , where a gust to 56 knots ( 104 km / h ) was recorded on June 7 . Maximum daily rainfall in the territory was recorded at Yuen Long on June 8 , when 41 @.@ 0 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 61 in ) was reported .

 = = = Tropical Storm Sharon ( Gading ) = = = 
 In mid @-@ June , not long after Tropical Storm Russ had made landfall , an area of convection south of Chuuk within the near @-@ equatorial trough began to consolidate . The system moved west @-@ northwest as it began to organize on June 20 . Acquiring tropical depression strength on June 21 , intensification halted due to vertical wind shear . Subsequent weakened led to its dissipation as a tropical depression by June 22 . 
 PAGASA named the system Gading as it neared the Philippines , and twelve hours after the final warning was issued , convection once again built up , and a new warning was issued . The Japan Meteorological Agency issued their first warning on Tropical Storm <unk> a day later . As it crossed Luzon , Sharon caused flooding and released mudflows from Mount Pinatubo , killing two people . Traffic on two main highways near Manila was disrupted by the mud . 
 After crossing Luzon , Sharon reached its peak , with vertical shear inhibiting further intensification . It made landfall on June 25 around 140 metres ( 0 @.@ 087 mi ) east @-@ northeast of Zhanjiang , or 110 kilometres ( 68 mi ) east of where Tropical Storm Russ had made landfall just weeks before . Winds gusted to 52 knots ( 96 km / h ) at Tai Mo Shan in Hong Kong . Sharon claimed 11 lives in the seas off Hong Kong , and the combined flooding effects of Russ and Sharon reportedly left more than 1 @,@ 400 people dead , and caused over $ 6 billion ( 1994 USD ) in damage .

 = = = Typhoon Tim ( Iliang ) = = = 
 A tropical disturbance formed in the Caroline Islands on July 5 south of a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough . The system organized into a tropical depression on the morning on July 6 . Moving northwest , the depression strengthened into a tropical storm as it approached 130 ° E on the morning of July 8 . Rapid intensification ensued , with Tim reaching typhoon intensity late on July 8 , peaking at 125 knots ( 232 km / h ) on July 10 . 
 From July 9 to July 11 , Tim and Tropical Storm Vanessa engaged in a Fujiwara interaction , and Tim absorbed the smaller Vanessa into its southeastern quadrant . Late on July 10 , Tim struck Taiwan , bringing gusts of 98 knots ( 181 km / h ) to <unk> as it made landfall about 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) south of Taipei . Continuing northwest , Tim moved into mainland China as a weaker typhoon , crossing the coast about 150 kilometres ( 93 mi ) south @-@ southwest of Fuzhou . It dissipated well inland on July 11 . 
 Damage was widespread in Taiwan , where Tim killed at least 19 people and left another 11 missing , and where 67 people reported injuries . A freighter with 97 mainland Chinese on board ran aground near <unk> . About 50 @,@ 000 hectares ( 500 square kilometres , 195 square miles ) of farmland was flooded , and more than 300 buildings collapsed during the storm . The bad weather also disrupted international flights , and knocked out electricity to over 2 million households . NT $ 2 billion ( 1994 TWD ) , or US $ 75 million ( 1994 dollars ) , was the reported cost of damage . 
 In Fujian Province , Typhoon Tim killed three people and flooded 140 @,@ 000 hectares ( 1 @,@ 400 km ² . , 540 sq. mi . ) of farmland , with damages estimated at 1 @.@ 5 billion renminbi ( 1994 RMB ) , or $ 173 @.@ 5 million ( 1994 USD ) . Tim was also blamed for 14 deaths and 6 injuries in the Philippines ( Pangasinan , Ilocos Sur and Ilocos Norte provinces ) as it passed near the area . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Vanessa ( Loleng ) = = = 
 As Tim developed in the Philippine Sea , a tropical disturbance in the South China Sea began to show development . Becoming a tropical depression late on July 8 , it strengthened into a tropical storm early on July 9 , with both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency classifying it a tropical storm . 
 Vanessa made an anti @-@ clockwise loop and then started to move northeastward under the steering influence of a monsoon flow and Typhoon Tim 's circulation , reaching a peak intensity of 45 knots ( 83 km / h ) west of Luzon before it was absorbed by the larger typhoon . The final warning was issued on July 11 after it was determined that Vanessa 's circulation had been absorbed . Vanessa was blamed for three deaths in the Philippines , where it was known as Loleng . 
 = = = Super Typhoon Walt ( Miding ) = = = 
 Walt was part of a three tropical cyclone outbreak along a reverse @-@ oriented monsoon trough ( aligned northeast @-@ southwest rather than the usual northwest @-@ southeast orientation . ) By July 11 , a thunderstorm cluster developed near Palau . The disturbance moved slowly northwest , becoming a tropical depression late on July 14 . As it neared the 15th parallel , Walt turned to the northeast and intensified . By the afternoon of July 19 the cyclone had become a super typhoon , the first of the season , an intensity it maintained for a day . While slowly weakening , Walt turned to the west . By the morning of July 23 the cyclone had dropped down to tropical storm strength as it turned to the north for a couple days . The storm turned back to the west , making landfall on the southwest end of Shikoku as a moderate tropical storm , bringing wind gusts to tropical storm force . The cyclone dissipated south of Korea by early on July 27 . Rainfall across South Korea helped improve severe drought conditions . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Yunya ( Norming ) = = = 
 The disturbance that was to become Tropical Storm Yunya was first mentioned on July 16 by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center when it was located in the South China Sea as cloudiness in a reverse @-@ oriented monsoon trough . A weak low @-@ level circulation was identified through animated satellite imagery and synoptic data early that morning . Moving east @-@ northeast , the system strengthened into Tropical Depression 11W by July 18 . At 0600 UTC that day , the Japan Meteorological Agency declared the formation of Tropical Storm <unk> . Yunya continued to undergo gradual strengthening , reaching its peak strength near landfall in northwest Luzon on the morning of July 19 . 
 As it tracked over land , it became disorganized and weakened to a minimal tropical storm . In the Philippine Sea , Yunya briefly restrengthened and reached a secondary peak of 40 knots ( 74 km / h ) . The JMA discontinued warnings after it deemed Yunya to have dropped below tropical storm intensity at 1800 UTC that day , while the JTWC continued monitoring the tropical depression until convection decreased and the storm dissipated on July 21 . During its life , Yunya had an unusual eastward motion , which was due to the reverse @-@ oriented monsoon trough . Yunya was also a small system , and appeared to have been undergoing a period of rapid organisation of convection shortly before it made landfall . 
 Heavy rain from Yunya caused landslides of volcanic debris from Mount Pinatubo . Coincidentally , a previous Typhoon Yunya in 1991 hit the Philippines the day of Mount Pinatubo 's major eruption . Gusts were in excess of 60 knots ( 110 km / h ) across Luzon . Yunya killed at least 11 people and injured at least 7 others , and affected over 420 @,@ 000 people . A total of $ 37 @.@ 6 million ( 1994 USD ) in damage was reported in the Philippines from Yunya .

 An area of persistent convection associated with a low @-@ level circulation centre moved off Hainan Island into water on July 29 . The Japan Meteorological Agency then reported that Tropical Storm <unk> had formed early that day , in the Gulf of Tonkin west of Hainan . This was later designated by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center as Tropical Depression 15W , and it was quickly upgraded to a tropical storm . It moved westward and started to weaken over water , making landfall south of Hanoi before dissipating inland . 
 Tropical Storm Amy killed 15 and left over 32 @,@ 000 people displaced in Thailand and Cambodia , and caused damage worth $ 8 million ( 1994 USD ) . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Brendan ( Oyang ) = = = 
 On July 26 a tropical disturbance developed in the Philippine Sea . The system moved northwest at a slow pace for a couple days . A southwest surge in the monsoon turned the disturbance northward , and the system became a tropical depression on the morning of July 29 . Accelerating to the north , Brendan became a tropical storm just before reaching Okinawa . The cyclone reached peak intensity to the south of Cheju Island , Korea as a moderate tropical storm . After recurving in the Yellow Sea , the storm recurved across Korea during extratropical transition with subtropical cyclone characteristics . The cyclone evolved into an extratropical cyclone while crossing the Sea of Japan , and reintensified . Up to 200 millimetres ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) of rain in the Korean peninsula helped relieve drought conditions . Two died in Korea during the passage of Brendan . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Caitlin ( Pasing ) = = = 
 A tropical disturbance formed within the monsoon trough northwest of Guam on July 29 . Slow development ensued , and four days later , it had become a tropical depression . By late on August 2 the cyclone had achieved tropical storm status . The system turned northwest and accelerated towards Taiwan / Taipei . During the morning of August 3 , Caitlin became a storm tropical storm as it made landfall in Hualien county . Green Island experienced gusts of typhoon force for 21 hours as the cyclone 's center moved to its north . Taking six hours to cross the mountainous island , Caitlin entered the Taiwan Straits on August 4 . Ten perished across Taiwan and damage there totaled NT $ 620 million ( 1994 dollars ) , or $ 23 @.@ 4 million ( 1994 USD ) . By late morning , its center passed inland into mainland China .

 On October 22 , an area of convection formed northwest of Hawaii in association with a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough . Moving rapidly westward , the low @-@ level circulation center associated with the convective clouds crossed the International Date Line later that day . The first mention of this system by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center in their Significant Tropical Weather Advisory six hours later noted that the low @-@ level circulation had been developing under the TUTT cell . Slowly developing , on October 23 , the system organized into Tropical Depression <unk> . The Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the system to Tropical Storm <unk> at 1200 UTC that day , shortly before the JTWC decided to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Yuri . The JTWC upgrade was based on a small area of deep convection which had formed to the southeast of the low @-@ level centre , as well as a rapid low @-@ level cloud motion of 40 knots ( 74 km / h ) that was observed to the north of the circulation . 
 Yuri remained a minimal tropical storm for the next two days or so before it was downgraded to a tropical depression because of a lack of deep convection and a weakening in its appearance on satellite imagery . The final warning was issued a few hours later on October 25 . There were no reports of damage or injuries . A weak wind of 11 knots ( 20 km / h ) associated with the dissipating system was recorded at Chichi @-@ jima on October 25 .

Continuing its clockwise movement , Zelda turned to the northwest , where it passed over the Northern Mariana Islands . On the 3rd the storm rapidly intensified to a 135 kn ( 250 km / h ) super typhoon , and as it turned to the northeast it slowly weakened to a tropical storm on the 8th .

 Forming along a near @-@ equatorial trough , a surface circulation formed on December 13 and began to move west @-@ northwestward . The system organized into a tropical depression on December 14 , but only for 12 hours as the system became much less organized and had more than one circulation center . On December 15 , the system began to regenerate due to increasing thunderstorm activity near its main circulation center , and by late in the day , was once again considered a tropical depression . Modestly developing thereafter , the tropical cyclone intensified into a typhoon on December 19 as it turned due west . 
 Axel moved south of Samar in the Philippines , weakening as it moved through the archipelago . Sixteen perished as the typhoon moved through the country , with five deaths occurring in Bacolod City as heavy rains caused a dam break . High waves destroyed 163 homes on <unk> . Entering the South China Sea as a tropical storm , the system briefly reintensified into a typhoon before vertical wind shear substantially increased , which led to significant weakening of Axel . The tropical cyclone dissipated 370 kilometres ( 230 mi ) southeast of Hong Kong on December 26 . 
 The remnants of Axel interacted with a low @-@ pressure area which is also the remnants of Bobbie as it created a large extratropical system , affecting Canada and finally dissipating on January 2 , 1995 .

 = Hebron Church ( Intermont , West Virginia ) = 
 Hebron Church ( also historically known as Great Capon Church , Hebron Lutheran Church , and Hebron Evangelical Lutheran Church ) is a mid @-@ 19th century Lutheran church in Intermont , Hampshire County , in the U.S. state of West Virginia . Hebron Church was founded in 1786 as Great Capon Church by German settlers in the Cacapon River Valley , making it the first Lutheran church west of the Shenandoah Valley . The congregation worshiped in a log church , which initially served both Lutheran and Reformed denominations . Its congregation was originally German @-@ speaking ; the church 's documents and religious services were in German until 1821 , when records and sermons transitioned to English . 
 The church 's congregation built the present Greek Revival @-@ style 1 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ story church building in 1849 , when it was renamed Hebron on the Cacapon . The original log church was moved across the road and subsequently used as a sexton 's house , Sunday school classroom , and public schoolhouse ( attended by future West Virginia governor Herman G. Kump ) . 
 To celebrate the congregation 's 175th anniversary in 1961 , Hebron Church constructed a brick community and religious education building designed to be architecturally compatible with the 1849 brick church . As of October 2015 , the church continues to be used by the West Virginia @-@ Western Maryland Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America . Hebron Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 16 , 2014 for its architectural distinction as a local example of vernacular Greek Revival church architecture in the Potomac Highlands .

 Hebron Church is on the plain of a predominantly rural agricultural and forested area of southeastern Hampshire County , in the Cacapon River Valley . Baker Mountain , a forested , narrow anticlinal mountain ridge , rises west of the church , and the western rolling foothills of the anticlinal Great North Mountain rise east of the valley . The Cacapon River , just southeast of the church , is hidden from the church and cemetery by mature foliage . George Washington National Forest , encompassing the forested area east of the Cacapon River , is east of the church . 
 The National Register of Historic Places listing for Hebron Church includes the brick church and cemetery . They are accessible from WV 259 by a semicircular asphalt driveway , separated from the church and cemetery by a wrought iron fence and lined with large , old @-@ growth maple trees along the property 's northwestern perimeter . A paved brick walkway leads from the gate to the northwestern façade and two main entrances of the church . The church is surrounded on its northeastern , southeastern , and southwestern sides by a cemetery which is still in use . The cemetery contains over 600 gravestones , several yuccas , a hemlock tree , and a boxwood . A modern brick community building , within the historic boundary south of the church and cemetery , is used for church activities .

 The land on which Hebron Church and its cemetery are located was originally part of the Northern Neck Proprietary , a land grant from Charles II of England to seven of his supporters in 1649 which was renewed by an official patent in 1688 . One of these seven supporters , Thomas Colepeper , 2nd Baron Colepeper , acquired the entire area in 1681 ; his grandson , Thomas Fairfax , 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron , inherited it in 1719 . Under Fairfax 's ownership , the Cacapon River Valley was predominantly inhabited by English @-@ speaking settlers as early as the late 1730s ; most came from Pennsylvania and New Jersey . As settlement progressed during the second half of the 18th century , the fertile land of Hampshire County ( including the Cacapon River Valley ) also attracted German settlers from Pennsylvania and elsewhere in Virginia before and after the American Revolutionary War ( 1775 – 1783 ) . 
 = = = Establishment = = = 
 As the population of German settlers in the region began to increase , the desire for Lutheran religious services and education also grew . Ministers , including Henry Muhlenberg disciple Christian Streit , began to establish congregations in the largest communities of western Virginia . Muhlenberg was a German pastor , requested by colonists in Pennsylvania , who served as a missionary there from 1742 until his death in 1787 ; he is considered the patriarch of the Lutheran Church in the United States . Johannes <unk> and Muhlenberg 's son , Peter , reportedly visited the Cacapon River Valley between 1763 and 1776 ( before Hebron Church 's founding ) . Streit , charged with ministering to a Lutheran congregation in Winchester , settled there on July 19 , 1785 . 
 Hebron Church , originally known as the Great Capon Church , was established by early German settlers in 1786 as a united German congregation of the Reformed and Lutheran denominations . The congregation was also known as the German Churches , since it served both denominations . In its earliest days , the church was served by pastors connected with congregations in the Shenandoah Valley . Streit incorporated the church into his circuit shortly after its founding , regularly traveling to the Cacapon River Valley for baptisms and weddings , but his ministry did not extend west of Cooper Mountain . According to the oldest extant church record , six people were confirmed in the Lutheran Synod and nine confirmed in the German Reformed Church in November 1786 . On September 23 , 1787 , seven more people were confirmed in the Lutheran Synod ; the church 's enrollment then began to increase . 
 Early religious services were held in the log church on land deeded to Reformed trustee Jacob Huber and Lutheran trustee John Nicholas Schweitzer , both of whom were church elders in 1786 . The deed conveying the land to the trustees specified that it was to be used for a German church and burial yard . The united congregation became Hebron Church , the first Lutheran church west of the Shenandoah Valley . 
 While the Reformed and Lutheran congregations used the log church , they were ministered by two pastors . Abraham Gottlieb Deschler ministered to the Lutherans and Jacob <unk> ( or <unk> ) ministered to the Reformed congregation until the latter dissolved around 1813 . Although the church served both denominations , it was later served by one minister ( Reformed or Lutheran ) . Originally a German @-@ speaking congregation , its documents and religious services were in German until 1821 ( an early transition to English for a German denomination in the United States ) . By that time , under the pastorship of Abraham Reck ( 1812 – 21 ) , the congregation was known as Capon Church . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 The congregation of Great Capon Church built the present one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ story Lutheran church building in 1849 , when it was briefly renamed Hebron on the Cacapon after Hebron ( the city associated with Judah , Abraham , and Isaac ) . The church was later known simply as Hebron Church . 
 The brick church was constructed east of the original log structure , which was west of the present community building . The 1849 church was originally topped by a wooden shake roof , and its windows had double @-@ hung wooden sashes . Its pews were built by Alfred Brill , Jacob <unk> and Frederick Secrist with lumber milled by Brill . The church was constructed under the ministry of H. J. Richardson ( 1848 – 53 ) . 
 The log church was moved from its original location in the south corner of the cemetery to a hill across the road from the brick church . It was used as a sexton 's house for the church , and was a Sunday school classroom for about 30 years . In addition to religious instruction , the log building was a public schoolhouse . Future West Virginia governor Herman G. Kump and his brother , judge Garnett Kerr Kump , received part of their primary education in the schoolhouse . By 1885 , a Mr. Miller was teaching business principles at the school . The log building succumbed to the elements , and no longer exists .

 Peter Miller ministered to the congregation at Hebron Church four times , for a total of 25 years , between 1858 and 1918 . Licensed in 1858 and ordained in 1860 , Miller engaged in missionary work for rural congregants in the Capon and North River Parish of Hampshire and Hardy counties for 60 years . He established many of the area 's Lutheran churches and , according to the North Carolina Synod of the Lutheran Church in America , was " an outstanding figure in this large , mountainous , thinly populated territory , who for sixty years almost continuously was recognized as everybody 's pastor . " By 1867 , the church membership was 106 , its largest congregation to date . 
 On October 13 , 1879 , a post office was established near Hebron Church to serve the adjacent community ( then known as Mutton Run ) . In December 1884 , the church roof caught fire from an adjacent flue , burning a hole through the sanctuary 's ceiling which was soon repaired . On August 11 – 15 , 1886 , Hebron Church celebrated its centennial . During the celebration , Miller read a complete history of the German churches in the region . The centennial was reportedly the first of any Lutheran congregation in the southern United States . 
 The wrought @-@ iron fence along the church driveway was installed in April 1895 , replacing a picket fence . In 1905 , the church 's wood roof was replaced with a metal one , the present stained @-@ glass windows were installed , its interior and woodwork were painted and new lamps were installed for better illumination . The stained @-@ glass windows were supplied by Madison Alling of Newark , New Jersey in memory of his father , who summered at nearby Capon Springs Resort . Alling also provided four hanging lamps and <unk> for the interior walls and paint for the interior woodwork . Anton <unk> of Wheeling , West Virginia funded the metal roof and the sanctuary 's painting and decoration . 
 On June 11 , 1915 , the post office changed its name to Intermont ( after the Intermountain Construction Company ) , operating until its closure on January 29 , 1972 . The unincorporated community around Hebron Church continues to be known as Intermont , after the former post office . By 1921 , the Winchester and Western Railroad had been constructed to the east of Hebron Church by the Intermountain Construction Company to connect Wardensville with Winchester and develop the area 's timber , mining , and fruit industries . 
 In 1932 , the church 's piano was donated by George E. Brill of Baltimore . Hebron Church celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1936 , during the pastorate of Lawrence P. Williamson ( 1930 – 37 ) . On October 29 , 1961 , in celebration of the church 's 175th anniversary , the congregation dedicated a new brick community and religious @-@ education building designed to be architecturally compatible with the 1849 brick church . The new building , which hosted community gatherings , events and Sunday school , was built just south of the brick church at the edge of the cemetery ( where the old log church was originally located ) . Walter A. Sigman ( 1960 – 65 ) was pastor when the community building was dedicated .

 In 2008 , a survey of historic properties in the county was undertaken by the State Historic Preservation Office of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History . Following this survey , he Hampshire County Historic Landmarks Commission and the Hampshire County Commission began an initiative to place these identified structures and districts on the National Register of Historic Places . Preparation of the necessary documentation for Hebron Church , French 's Mill , Yellow Spring Mill , and the Nathaniel and Isaac Kuykendall House began in April 2013 , when Governor Earl Ray Tomblin awarded $ 10 @,@ 500 to the Hampshire County Commission . The cost of the commission 's documentation of the history and significance of the four properties was $ 15 @,@ 000 , of which the county paid $ 4 @,@ 500 . 
 All four properties were accepted for the NRHP on December 16 , 2014 , with Hebron Church a unique local example of Greek Revival church architecture in the Potomac Highlands . Because the church 's original architectural design , workmanship , and building materials are extant , architectural historian Sandra Scaffidi assessed the church as providing " insight into the construction techniques of a mid @-@ 19th @-@ century ecclesiastical building . " Hebron Church is one of six extant , rural pre @-@ Civil War church buildings in Hampshire County ; the other five are <unk> Presbyterian Church ( 1825 ) , Mount Bethel Church ( 1837 ) , Old Pine Church ( 1838 ) , Capon Chapel ( c . 1852 ) , and North River Mills United Methodist Church ( 1860 ) . 
 As of October 2015 , the church 's congregation is part of the Potomac Conference in the West Virginia @-@ Western Maryland Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America . <unk> by David A. <unk> , Hebron Church has 22 baptized members , 19 confirmed members and an average attendance of six .

 = = Architecture = = 
 According to Sandra Scaffidi , Hebron Church 's architecture exemplifies a " local interpretation " of the Greek Revival architectural style , which was popular at the time of its construction . With its simple wooden doors , returning eaves and symmetrical front gable design , Hebron Church is representative of a vernacular interpretation of Greek Revival architecture . Only one other church building in eastern Hampshire County , Timber Ridge Christian Church in High View , was built of brick . The overall plan of Hebron Church exemplifies traditional Lutheranism , with the sanctuary 's one @-@ room floor plan enabling the congregation to be near its minister and easily participate in worship . Scaffidi wrote , " The Greek Revival front @-@ gable form of the Hebron Church reflects the early settlers ' desire to worship in a modest , uncluttered fashion . " 
 = = = Exterior = = = 
 The 1849 church is a small , one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ story , front @-@ gable building . The main façade ( northwestern elevation ) has two main entrances , enclosed by white @-@ painted wood , recessed panel doors , and capped by white @-@ painted stone lintels with two stone corner blocks . The church 's exterior is brickwork , laid in Flemish bond on the main façade and a five @-@ course American bond on the northeastern , southeastern and southwestern elevations . Two blue @-@ gray stained glass windows ( installed in 1905 ) are symmetrically placed above the main entrances , each capped by stone lintels with two stone corner blocks . The main façade is crowned by a white painted entablature molding with two cornice returns , exemplifying Greek Revival architectural design . In the top of the gable , a square date stone engraved " 1849 " is embedded in the brickwork above a gooseneck light fixture . Although the church is now topped by a metal standing @-@ seam roof , it was originally sheathed by wooden shakes . 
 On the church 's northeastern elevation there are three large , symmetrical stained @-@ glass windows , each with a fixed upper sash and a lower hopper sash . Like the main façade 's doorways and windows , the sills , lintels and lintel corner blocks of the stained @-@ glass windows are white @-@ painted stone . Below the windows is an exposed coursed @-@ stone foundation with five tie @-@ rod masonry anchor plates . A small brick chimney is present on this elevation . The church 's southwestern elevation also has a coursed @-@ stone foundation , with five tie @-@ rod anchor plates , banked into the ground below three symmetrical stained @-@ glass windows with fixed upper sashes and lower hopper sashes and encased with white @-@ painted stone sills , lintels and lintel corner blocks . On this elevation are a small brick chimney in the roof slope and metal snowbirds along the roof line . <unk> are located at the southern corners of the northeastern and southwestern elevations . The church 's southeastern ( rear ) elevation has an exposed coursed @-@ stone foundation 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) high , due to its location on sloping ground . At the center of this elevation is a protruding , gabled brick extension for the interior altar , with symmetrical stained @-@ glass windows on both sides . The gabled protrusion is capped by aluminum flashing . An 1895 wrought @-@ iron fence encloses the property 's northwestern perimeter , and a paved brick walkway provides pedestrian access from the driveway to the two main entrances .

 The church interior has an open floor plan , with a sanctuary measuring 28 feet ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) wide and 43 feet ( 13 m ) long . The floor plan is an open nave , with two aisles partitioning three sections of rectangular wooden pews . Although the pews had been painted white , they have been restored to their original wood finish . The sanctuary 's interior walls are plaster , and the floors are sheathed in wide wooden planks . The nave is topped by a ceiling fabricated on tongue and groove wooden planks painted white . Three large stained @-@ glass windows , framed by wooden molding and recessed approximately 6 inches ( 15 cm ) , are symmetrically located on the northeastern and southwestern walls . The lower portion of each window contains a memorial dedication , which opens into its lower hopper sash . On the northwestern side of the interior are the two main entry doors , which access an unadorned narthex . Two tapered @-@ square pilasters support an upper gallery loft , possibly used by slaves during religious services . The gallery is fronted by a solid balustrade , accented with dentil molding and recessed wooden panels . 
 At the southeastern end of the sanctuary , the altar is atop a decagonal platform about 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) above the floor and accessible by a pair of four @-@ step staircases . On the elevated platform is also a table holding a Bible . A recessed rectangular apse , flanked by a pair of fluted , engaged columns , is behind the altar . A painting of Jesus hangs in the center of the apse , with an American flag to its immediate north . An organ and a piano are north of the altar , with a baptismal font south of it . The altar platform and aisles are carpeted red . The sanctuary 's northern and southern elevations exposed brick chimneys connected to gas heating units , which were installed around 1970 . A brass chandelier with clear glass hurricane globes is suspended in the center of the sanctuary ; on the northern and southern elevations , two brass electric lanterns are adjacent to the stained @-@ glass windows . 
 The upper gallery on the northwestern side of the church is accessed by a twelve @-@ step wooden spiral staircase , and has an unfinished wooden floor . Four wooden pews have white @-@ painted sides and unfinished seats and rails . The gallery 's ceiling height is about 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) at its tallest and about 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) at its shortest , due to the sloping wooden floor . Two stained @-@ glass windows , which cannot be opened , are along the northwest wall . A small closet , accessible through a wooden door with two parallel vertical panels and original latch hardware , is at the base of the staircase . The church 's original plasterwork and a 10 @-@ inch ( 25 cm ) vertically @-@ cut wooden board , suggesting half @-@ timbering , are visible in the closet .

Similar to the church , the building is built into a gently @-@ sloping bank with its one @-@ story elevation at grade facing west toward WV 259 . Its two @-@ story eastern elevation is at the foot of the hillside . 
 The building 's western façade has a central entryway with double doors , topped by a six @-@ light transom and flanked by engaged pilasters . Its gable , sheathed in aluminum siding , incorporates a gabled pediment and the building 's perimeter is surrounded by a wide , flat frieze . The building 's southern elevation has wooden windows with 12 @-@ over @-@ 12 double @-@ hung sashes on brick window sills . Its basement level has one entrance , flanked by wooden double @-@ hung sash windows and four casement windows . The northeastern elevation has three stained @-@ glass windows on the main level , with three wooden eight @-@ over @-@ eight double @-@ hung sash windows ; a single wooden six @-@ over @-@ six double @-@ hung sash window is in the gable . The building is roofed with asphalt shingles , and a brick chimney is along the slope of the northern elevation 's roof line .

 = = = Cemetery = = = 
 Hebron Church is surrounded on three sides by a cemetery , consisting of about 700 granite , marble , slate and wooden gravestones laid in semi @-@ regular rows running northeast to southeast . The cemetery also abuts the northeastern elevation of the community building . Its interments date from about 1806 to the present ; early gravestones have deteriorated beyond recognition , and may be older than 1806 . Slaves and other people of color are interred in a small area of the cemetery 's southeastern section , with simpler markers than the cemetery 's other gravestones . Although its gravestones are generally rectangular granite stones and large obelisks , the cemetery 's earliest gravestones were simple wooden boards . Several gravestones are ornately carved , including one modeled on a tree stump . The cemetery is active , with the most recent burials at the property 's northern end . Dr. William Blum , Sr. , an <unk> at the National Bureau of Standards who invented a chrome plating technique used in banknote printing , is interred at the cemetery . 
 = Russo @-@ Georgian War = 
 The Russo @-@ Georgian War was a war between Georgia , Russia and the Russian @-@ backed self @-@ proclaimed republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia . The war took place in August 2008 following a period of worsening relations between Russia and Georgia , both formerly constituent republics of the Soviet Union . The fighting took place in the strategically important Transcaucasia region , which borders the Middle East . It was regarded as the first European war of the 21st century . 
 The Republic of Georgia declared its independence in early 1991 as the Soviet Union began to fall apart . Amidst this backdrop , a war between Georgia and separatists left parts of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast under the de facto control of Russian @-@ backed but internationally unrecognised separatists . Following the war , a joint peacekeeping force of Georgian , Russian and Ossetian troops was stationed in the territory . Meanwhile , a similar stalemate developed in the second rebel region of Abkhazia , which had waged its own separatist war in 1992 – 1993 . Following Vladimir Putin 's rise to power in Russia in 2000 and a pro @-@ Western change of power in Georgia in 2003 , relations between Russia and Georgia began to deteriorate , reaching a full diplomatic crisis by April 2008 . By August 1 , 2008 , Ossetian separatists began shelling Georgian villages , with a sporadic response from Georgian peacekeepers in the region . To put an end to these deadly attacks and restore order , the Georgian Army was sent to the South Ossetian conflict zone on 7 August . Georgians took control of most of Tskhinvali , a separatist stronghold , in hours . Georgia later stated it was also responding to Russia moving non @-@ peacekeeping units into the country . 
 Russia accused Georgia of " aggression against South Ossetia " , and launched a large @-@ scale land , air and sea invasion of Georgia on 8 August with the stated aim of " peace enforcement " operation . Russian and Ossetian forces battled Georgian forces in and around South Ossetia for several days , until Georgian forces retreated . Russian and Abkhaz forces opened a second front by attacking the Kodori Gorge held by Georgia . Russian naval forces blockaded part of the Georgian coast . This was the first war in history in which cyber warfare coincided with military action . An active information war was also waged during and after the conflict . President of France Nicolas Sarkozy negotiated a ceasefire agreement on 12 August . 
 Russian forces temporarily occupied the Georgian cities of Zugdidi , Senaki , Poti , and Gori , holding on to these areas beyond the ceasefire . The South Ossetians destroyed most ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia and were responsible for an ethnic cleansing of Georgians . Russia recognised Abkhazia and South Ossetia as separate republics on 26 August ; in response , the Georgian government severed diplomatic relations with Russia . Russia mostly completed its withdrawal of troops from Georgia proper on 8 October . In the aftermath , Russia 's international relations were largely unharmed . The war displaced 192 @,@ 000 people and while many returned to their homes after the war , 20 @,@ 272 people remained displaced as of 2014 . The Russian military has , since the war , increased its presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia in violation of the ceasefire agreement of August 2008 .

 = = = History = = = 
 In the tenth century AD , Georgia for the first time emerged as an ethnic concept in the territories where the Georgian language was used to perform Christian rituals . After the Mongol invasions of the region , the Kingdom of Georgia eventually was broken up into several kingdoms and principalities . In the nineteenth century , the Russian Empire gradually annexed the Georgian lands . In the aftermath of the Russian revolution , Georgia declared its independence on 26 May 1918 . 
 The Ossetian people are indigenous to North Ossetia , located in the North Caucasus . Controversy surrounds the date of Ossetian arrival in Transcaucasia . According to one theory , they first migrated there during the 13th and 14th centuries AD , and lived alongside the Georgians peacefully for centuries . In 1918 , conflict began between the landless Ossetian peasants living in <unk> Kartli , who were influenced by Bolshevism and demanded ownership of the lands they worked and the Menshevik government backed ethnic Georgian aristocrats , who were legal owners . Although the Ossetians were initially discontented with the economic policies of the central government , the tension soon transformed into ethnic conflict . During uprisings in 1919 and 1920 , the Ossetians were covertly supported by Soviet Russia , but even so , were defeated . 
 The independent Democratic Republic of Georgia was invaded by the Red Army in 1921 and a Soviet government was installed . The government of Soviet Georgia created an autonomous administrative unit for Transcaucasian Ossetians in April 1922 , called the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast . Historians such as Stephen F. Jones , Emil <unk> and Arsène <unk> believe that the Bolsheviks granted this autonomy to the Ossetians in exchange for their help in fighting the Democratic Republic of Georgia , since this area had never been a separate entity prior to the Russian invasion . 
 Nationalism in Soviet Georgia emerged in 1989 when the weakening of the Soviet Union began . The Kremlin endorsed South Ossetian nationalism as a counter against the Georgian independence movement . On 11 December 1990 , the Supreme Soviet of Georgia abolished the South Ossetian autonomous region . Georgia declared its restoration of independence on 9 April 1991 , thus becoming the first non @-@ Baltic state of the Soviet Union to do so . A military conflict broke out between Georgia and South Ossetia in January 1991 , which lasted until June 1992 . The separatists were aided by former Soviet military units now under Russian command . The war resulted in South Ossetian separatists achieving de facto independence from Georgia . After the Sochi agreement in 1992 , Georgian , South Ossetian , Russian and North Ossetian peacekeepers were stationed in South Ossetian conflict zone under the Joint Control Commission 's ( <unk> ) mandate . Some parts of the former South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast remained under the Georgian control . 
 This situation was mirrored in Abkhazia , an autonomous republic in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic , where the Abkhaz minority seceded from Georgia during the early 1990s . The population of Abkhazia was reduced to 216 @,@ 000 after an ethnic cleansing of Georgians , a decrease from 525 @,@ 000 before the war . An unrecognised government did not control the entire territory of Abkhazia .

 Transcaucasia lies between the Russian region of the North Caucasus and the Middle East , forming a " buffer zone " between Russia and the Middle East . It borders Turkey and Iran . The strategic importance of the region has made it a security concern for Russia . Significant economic reasons , such as presence or transportation of oil , also affect interest in Transcaucasia . Control of Transcaucasia , according to Swedish academic Svante Cornell , would enable Russia to control Western influence in the geopolitically important region of Central Asia . 
 Russia saw the Black Sea coast and the border with Turkey as invaluable strategic attributes of Georgia . Russia had more vested interests in Abkhazia than in South Ossetia , since the Russian military presence on the Black Sea coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in the Black Sea . Before the early 2000s , South Ossetia was originally intended as a tool to retain a grip on Georgia . 
 Vladimir Putin became president of the Russian Federation in 2000 , which had a profound impact on Russo @-@ Georgian relations . The conflict between Russia and Georgia began to escalate in December 2000 , when Georgia became the first and only member of the Commonwealth of Independent States ( CIS ) on which the Russian visa regime was imposed . In December 2001 , Eduard Kokoity , an alleged member of organised crime , became de facto president of South Ossetia ; he was endorsed by Russia since he would subvert the peaceful reintegration of South Ossetia into Georgia . The Russian government began massive distribution of Russian passports to the residents of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 2002 without Georgia 's permission ; this " <unk> " policy laid the foundation for Russia 's future claim to these territories . In 2003 , President Putin began to consider the possibility of a military solution to the conflict with Georgia . 
 After Georgia deported four suspected Russian spies in 2006 , Russia began a full @-@ scale diplomatic and economic war against Georgia , accompanied by the persecution of ethnic Georgians living in Russia . 
 By 2008 , most residents of South Ossetia had obtained Russian passports . According to Reuters , Russia supplied two @-@ thirds of South Ossetia 's annual budget before the war . Russian officials had de facto control of South Ossetia 's security institutions , including the armed forces ; South Ossetia 's de facto government was largely staffed with Russians and South Ossetians with Russian passports , who had occupied equivalent government positions in Russia .

 The conflicts in Georgia remained at a stalemate until 2004 , when Mikheil Saakashvili came to power after Georgia 's Rose Revolution , which ousted president Eduard Shevardnadze . Restoring South Ossetia and Abkhazia to Georgian control was a top @-@ priority of Saakashvili 's . 
 The Georgian government launched an initiative to curb smuggling from South Ossetia in 2004 after its success in restoring control in <unk> . Tensions were further escalated by South Ossetian authorities . Intense fighting took place between Georgian forces and South Ossetian militia between 8 and 19 August . 
 At the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in January 2005 , Georgian president Saakashvili proposed a peace settlement for South Ossetia within a unified Georgian state . The proposal was rejected by South Ossetian president Eduard Kokoity . In 2006 , Georgia sent security forces to the Kodori Valley region of Abkhazia , when a local militia leader rebelled against Georgian authorities . In 2007 , Georgia established what Russia called a " puppet government " in South Ossetia , led by Dmitry <unk> ( former South Ossetian prime minister ) , calling it a provisional administration . 
 Georgia began proposing the placement of international peacekeeping forces in the separatist regions when Russia began to apply more pressure on Georgia after April 2008 . The West launched new initiatives for peace settlement , with peace plans being offered and conferences being organised by the European Union , the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) and Germany . Georgia accepted the German project for Abkhazia , but the separatists dismissed it . Russia and the separatists did not attend an EU @-@ funded peace conference on Abkhazia . They also dismissed an OSCE offer to renew talks regarding South Ossetia . 
 = = = Relations between Georgia and the West = = = 
 One of President Saakashvili 's primary goals for Georgia was NATO membership , which has been one of the major stumbling blocks in Georgia @-@ Russia relations . 
 Although Georgia has no significant oil or gas reserves , its territory hosts part of the Baku – Tbilisi – Ceyhan pipeline supplying Europe . The pipeline circumvents both Russia and Iran . Because it has decreased Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil , the pipeline has been a major factor in the United States ' support for Georgia . 
 During the NATO summit in Bucharest in April 2008 , American president George W. Bush lobbied for offering a Membership Action Plan ( MAP ) to Georgia and Ukraine . However , Germany and France said that offering MAP to Ukraine and Georgia would be " an unnecessary offence " to Russia . NATO stated that Ukraine and Georgia would become members of the alliance and pledged to review the applications for MAP in December 2008 . Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Bucharest during the summit . At the end of the summit on 4 April , Putin said that expansion of NATO to Russia 's borders " would be taken in Russia as a direct threat to the security of our country " . After the Bucharest summit , Russia became more aggressive and began to actively prepare for the invasion of Georgia . Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Yuri <unk> said on 11 April that Russia would take " steps of a different nature " in addition to military action to prevent NATO membership of former Soviet republics . General <unk> admitted in 2012 that when the decision to attack Georgia was taken by President Putin before Dmitry Medvedev assumed the office of president in May 2008 , a military action was planned and explicit orders were issued in advance before August 2008 . Russia aimed to stop Georgia 's accession to NATO and also to bring about a " regime change " .

 On 16 April 2008 Russian president Vladimir Putin authorised official ties between the Russian government and the separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia by signing a decree . The legal acts issued by the separatists and the entities registered under them were also recognised . After a United Nations Security Council meeting on 23 April convened at Georgia 's request , the United States , the United Kingdom , France and Germany issued a statement saying : " We call on the Russian Federation to revoke or not to implement its decision . " However , this was labelled a " tall order " by Vitaly Churkin , Russia 's Ambassador to the UN . 
 A Russian jet shot down a Georgian reconnaissance drone flying over Abkhazia on 20 April . However , Russia denied responsibility for the incident and Abkhazia claimed that the drone was shot down by an " L @-@ 39 aircraft of the Abkhaz Air Force " . An allegation of an attack by a NATO MiG @-@ 29 was made by the Russia ' Ambassador to NATO , Dmitry Rogozin . NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer commented that " he 'd eat his tie if it turned out that a NATO MiG @-@ 29 had magically appeared in Abkhazia and shot down a Georgian drone . " On 26 May , a United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia ( UNOMIG ) investigation concluded that the jet belonged to the Russian Air Force ; it was either a MiG @-@ 29 " Fulcrum " or a Su @-@ 27 " Flanker " . 
 In late April , the Russian government said that Georgia was amassing 1 @,@ 500 soldiers and police in the upper Kodori Gorge area and was planning to " invade " Abkhazia , and that Russia would retaliate against Georgian attack and had boosted its forces in the separatist regions . Any buildup in the Kodori Gorge or near the Abkhaz border by either party was not confirmed by the UNOMIG . 
 Russia increased the number of its peacekeepers in Abkhazia to 2 @,@ 542 in early May , but its troop levels remained under the limit of 3 @,@ 000 imposed by a 1994 decision of CIS heads of state . Georgia showed video footage captured by a drone to the BBC allegedly proving that Russian troops used heavy hardware in Abkhazia and were a fighting force , rather than peacekeepers ; Russia denied the accusations . On 15 May , the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for the return of all refugees and internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) to Abkhazia . Russia voted against the Georgian @-@ sponsored resolution . The Russian Foreign Ministry said that the resolution was " a counterproductive move " . 
 Russia sent railway troops ( unarmed , according to the Russian defence ministry ) on 31 May to repair a rail line in Abkhazia . Georgia stated that the move was an " aggressive " act . The European Parliament adopted a resolution on 5 June which condemned the deployment of Russian forces to Abkhazia . The resolution stated that the peacekeeping structure must be changed because Russia was no longer an unbiased player . Russian railway troops began withdrawal from Abkhazia on 30 July after attending the opening ceremony of the railway line . The repaired railway was used to transport military equipment by at least a part of the 9 @,@ 000 Russian soldiers who entered Georgia from Abkhazia during the war . 
 In late June , Russian military expert Pavel <unk> predicted that Vladimir Putin would start a war against Georgia in Abkhazia and South Ossetia supposedly in August . The Kavkaz Center reported in early July that Chechen separatists had intelligence data that Russia was preparing a military operation against Georgia in August – September 2008 which mainly aimed to expel Georgian forces from the Kodori Gorge ; this would be followed by the expulsion of Georgian military and population from South Ossetia . 
 In early July , the security situation in South Ossetia aggravated , when a South Ossetian separatist militia official was killed by explosions on 3 July and several hours later an unsuccessful assassination attempt on Dmitry <unk> , the leader of the Georgian @-@ backed Ossetian government , injured three policemen . On 7 July , four Georgian soldiers were captured by South Ossetian separatists . The next day , the Georgian president ordered police to get ready to liberate the soldiers . Four Russian Air Force jets flew over South Ossetia on 8 July . A scheduled visit of Condoleezza Rice , the US Secretary of State , to Georgia on the next day nearly coincided with the timing of the flight . Georgia recalled its ambassador to Russia after Russia admitted its planes had flown in Georgia 's airspace to " let hot heads in Tbilisi cool down " . This was the first time in a decade that Russia had admitted to an overflight of Georgian territory . 
 On 15 July , the United States and Russia began two parallel military exercises in the Caucasus , though Russia denied that the identical timing was intentional . The joint US @-@ Georgian exercise was called Immediate Response 2008 and also included servicemen from Ukraine , Azerbaijan and Armenia . A total of 1 @,@ 630 servicemen , including 1 @,@ 000 American troops , took part in the exercise , which concluded on 31 July . Counter @-@ insurgency action was the focal point of the joint exercise . The Georgian brigade was trained to serve in Iraq . The Russian exercise was named Caucasus 2008 and units of the North Caucasus Military District , including the 58th Army , participated . The exercise included training to aid peacekeepers stationed in Abkhazia and South Ossetia . During exercises , a leaflet named " Soldier ! Know your probable enemy ! " was circulated among the Russian participants . The leaflet described the Georgian Armed Forces . Russian troops remained near the Georgian border after the end of their exercise on 2 August , instead of returning to their bases . 
 = = = Early August = = = 
 At 8 : 00 am on 1 August , a Georgian police lorry was blown up by an improvised explosive device on the road near Tskhinvali , injuring five Georgian policemen . In response , South Ossetian border checkpoints were assaulted by Georgian snipers during the evening , killing four Ossetians and injuring seven . 
 Ossetian separatists began intensively shelling Georgian villages on 1 August , with a sporadic response from Georgian peacekeepers and other troops in the region . During the night of 1 / 2 August , grenades and mortar fire were exchanged . The number of Ossetian casualties rose to six and the number of injured to fifteen , including several civilians ; the Georgian casualties were six injured civilians and one injured policeman . According to the OSCE mission , the incident was the worst outbreak of violence since 2004 . On 2 – 3 and again on 3 – 4 August , firing recommenced during the night . A 1992 ceasefire agreement was breached by Ossetian artillery attacks . 
 The Russian deputy defence minister , Nikolay Pankov , had a secret meeting with the separatist authorities in Tskhinvali on 3 August . An evacuation of Ossetian women and children to Russia began on the same day . According to researcher Andrey <unk> , the South Ossetian separatists evacuated more than 20 @,@ 000 civilians , which represented more than 90 percent of the civilian population of the future combat zone . 
 On 4 August , South Ossetian president Eduard Kokoity said that about 300 volunteers had arrived from North Ossetia to help fight the Georgians and thousands more were expected from the North Caucasus . On 5 August , Georgian authorities organised a tour for journalists and diplomats to demonstrate the damage supposedly caused by separatists . That day , Russian Ambassador @-@ at @-@ Large Yuri Popov declared that his country would intervene on the side of South Ossetia . The destruction of the village of <unk> was ordered by South Ossetian interior minister <unk> . About 50 Russian journalists had arrived in <unk> . They were waiting for " something to happen " . A pro @-@ government Russian newspaper reported on 6 August : " Don Cossacks prepare to fight in South Ossetia " . 
 Mortar and artillery exchange between the South Ossetian and Georgian forces erupted in the afternoon of 6 August along almost the entire line of contact , which lasted until the dawn of 7 August . Exchanges resumed following a brief gap in the morning . At 14 : 00 on 7 August , two Georgian peacekeepers were killed in Avnevi as a result of Ossetian shelling . At about 14 : 30 , Georgian tanks , 122 mm howitzers and 203 mm self @-@ propelled artillery began heading towards South Ossetia to dissuade separatists from additional attacks . During the afternoon , OSCE monitors recorded Georgian military traffic , including artillery , on roads near Gori . In the afternoon , Georgian personnel left the Joint Peacekeeping Force headquarters in Tskhinvali . 
 At 16 : 00 , <unk> Iakobashvili ( the Georgian Minister for Reintegration ) arrived in Tskhinvali for a previously @-@ arranged meeting with South Ossetians and Russian diplomat Yuri Popov ; however , Russia 's special envoy , who blamed a flat tire , did not appear ; and neither did the Ossetians . One day earlier the South Ossetians refused to participate in bilateral talks , demanding a session of the Joint Control Commission for Georgian – Ossetian Conflict Resolution . Tbilisi had withdrawn from the Commission in March , demanding that body include the European Union , the OSCE and the Provisional Administrative Entity of South Ossetia . Iakobashvili met with General Marat <unk> ( the Russian commander of the Joint Peacekeeping Force ) who said that Russian peacekeepers could not stop Ossetians and Georgia should implement a ceasefire . " Nobody was in the streets – no cars , no people , " Iakobashvili later told journalists . 
 At around 19 : 00 , Georgian President Saakashvili announced a unilateral ceasefire and no @-@ response order . The ceasefire reportedly held for about three hours . Russia regarded the ceasefire as an attempt to buy time to deploy Georgian forces for an offensive . The separatists shelled <unk> and <unk> after Saakashvili 's ceasefire . They destroyed Avnevi and a police station in Kurta , the seat of the Provisional Administrative Entity of South Ossetia . The escalated attacks forced civilians to flee the Georgian villages . A senior official from the Georgian Ministry of Defence said late on August 7 that his country was going to " restore constitutional order " in response to the shelling . Georgian Interior Ministry official later told Russian newspaper Kommersant ( on 8 August ) that after Ossetians had responded to the ceasefire by shelling , " it became clear " that South Ossetians wouldn 't stop firing and the Georgian casualties were 10 killed and 50 wounded . According to Pavel <unk> , the Ossetians intentionally provoked the Georgians , so Russia would use the Georgian response as a pretext for premeditated military invasion . 
 According to Georgian intelligence , and several Russian media reports , parts of the regular ( non @-@ peacekeeping ) Russian Army had already moved to South Ossetian territory through the Roki Tunnel before the Georgian military operation . Even the state @-@ controlled Russian TV showed Abkhazia 's de facto president Sergei <unk> on 7 August as saying : " I have spoken to the president of South Ossetia . It has more or less stabilized now . A battalion from the North Caucasus District has entered the area . " Georgian president Saakashvili later told journalists that around 23 : 00 on 7 August , Russian tanks had begun moving into Georgia , causing the Georgians to open fire with artillery weapons .

 Georgian artillery units launched smoke bombs into South Ossetia at 23 : 35 on 7 August . This was followed by a 15 @-@ minute intermission ( which purportedly enabled the civilians to escape ) before the Georgian forces began bombarding enemy targets . 
 Early in the morning on 8 August the Georgian 4th Brigade from <unk> Military Base advanced on the left flank of Tskhinvali ; the 3rd Brigade advanced on the right flank . The aim of the flank operations was to advance northward after capturing key positions . The Georgian troops would take the Gupta bridge and the road to the Roki Tunnel , barring the Russian troops from moving southward . 
 Georgian forces started moving towards Tskhinvali following several hours of bombardment and engaged South Ossetian forces and militia near the town at 04 : 00 on 8 August , with Georgian tanks remotely shelling South Ossetian positions . An attempt to take the village of <unk> from the west of South Ossetia by the Georgian special forces was thwarted by a platoon of South Ossetian troops occupying fortified positions ; several Georgian soldiers were wounded . The Georgian 3rd Brigade entered the <unk> region ( east of Tskhinvali ) at 06 : 00 and captured strategic positions . They faced resistance from a company @-@ sized South Ossetian unit positioned in the <unk> Heights . By the morning , the South Ossetian authorities had reported that the Georgian shelling had killed at least 15 civilians . 
 Georgian forces ( among them special forces of the Ministry of Internal Affairs ) entered Tskhinvali after taking the heights near the town . The centre of the town was reached by 1 @,@ 500 men of the Georgian ground forces by 10 : 00 . The Russian air force began bombing targets inside South Ossetia and Georgia proper after 10 : 00 on 8 August . According to Russia , it suffered its first casualties at around 12 : 00 when two servicemen were killed and five wounded following an attempt by the Georgian troops to storm the northern peacekeeping base in Tskhinvali . Georgia has stated that it only targeted Russian peacekeepers in self @-@ defence , after coming under fire from them . Most of Tskhinvali and several villages had been secured by Georgian forces by the afternoon ; however , they failed to achieve their objective of blocking the Gupta bridge and the main roads ( linking <unk> with the Roki Tunnel and the Russian military base in Java ) . One Georgian diplomat told Kommersant on the same day that by taking control of Tskhinvali , Tbilisi wanted to demonstrate that Georgia wouldn 't tolerate killing of Georgian citizens . 
 By 15 : 00 MSK , an emergency meeting of Security Council of Russia had been convened by Russian president Dmitry Medvedev and Russia 's options regarding the conflict in South Ossetia had been discussed . Russia accused Georgia of " aggression against South Ossetia " . Russia stated it was defending both peacekeepers and South Ossetian civilians ( who were Russian citizens ) . While Russia claimed that it had to conduct peacekeeping operations according to the international mandates , in reality such agreements had only arranged the ceasefire observer status ; according to political scientist Roy Allison , Russia could evacuate its peacekeepers if attacked . At around 16 : 00 MSK , it became known that two tank columns of the 58th Army passed the Roki Tunnel and Java and were on the road to Tskhinvali . The column had begun moving towards South Ossetia at the same time as President Medvedev was giving a televised speech . According to Kommersant , at around 17 : 00 MSK , Russian tank columns surrounded Tskhinvali and began bombing the Georgian positions . The Russian Air Force mounted attacks on Georgian infantry and artillery on 8 August , but suspended sorties for two days after taking early losses from anti @-@ aircraft fire . Georgian troops left the centre of the town in the evening . 
 In the afternoon of 9 August , Georgian attempt to push into Tskhinvali was repulsed with Georgian losses and they withdrew . According to the Georgian Defence Minister , the Georgian military had tried to push into Tskhinvali three times by 9 August . During the last attempt they were met with a heavy counterattack , which Georgian officers described as " something like hell . " On the same day a Russian advance column , led by Lieutenant @-@ General Anatoly <unk> , was ambushed by Georgian special forces near Tskhinvali ; <unk> was wounded in the leg . The number of Russian forces deployed in South Ossetia exceeded the number of Georgians by 9 August . 
 A unilateral ceasefire was announced on 10 August by the Georgian government . An intention to pull out Georgian troops from South Ossetia was stated by the Georgian government . However , Russia did not embrace this ceasefire offer . The duration of the military engagement was three days and nights in the Tskhinvali region . After the ceasefire agreement was negotiated by French president Nicolas Sarkozy on 12 August , military action was to cease at 15 : 00 on 12 August , however Russian forces didn 't stop to advance . 
 = = = Bombing and occupation of Gori = = = 
 Gori is an important city in central Georgia , located about 25 km ( 16 mi ) from Tskhinvali . On 9 August , a Russian air attack targeted military garrisons in Gori , damaging the base , several apartment buildings and a school . Russia denied intentionally attacking civilians . The Georgian government reported that the air raid had killed 60 civilians . At least five Georgian cities had been bombed by 9 August . 
 After Georgian troops had left Tskhinvali on 10 August , the Russians indiscriminately bombed the civilian areas in Gori on 11 August . The Georgian forces withdrew from Gori on 11 August . A Georgian official said that the troops were ordered to secure Tbilisi . By late 11 August , most remaining inhabitants and Georgian troops had abandoned Gori . Georgian president Saakashvili stated that Russians had split Georgia into two by occupying an important crossroad near Gori . 
 Russian planes bombed Gori on 12 August , killing a seven people and wounding over thirty . Dutch television journalist Stan <unk> was among those killed and another foreign correspondent was injured . Georgian officials said that the Russians targeted the city 's administrative buildings . The air raids set the post office and the Gori University on fire . The Gori Military Hospital was struck by a missile , in spite of the fact that it was flying a Red Cross flag , killing one doctor . 
 Russian forces occupied Gori on 13 August . A Russian military spokesman said that military hardware and ammunition was being confiscated from an abandoned arms depot near the city . On 14 August , Major General Vyacheslav Borisov ( the commander of the Russian occupying troops ) told <unk> <unk> , secretary of Georgia 's National Security Council , that the Russian presence did not upset the locals of Gori . That day , Borisov stated that the Georgian police and Russian troops were jointly in charge of Gori . He also said that Russian troops would begin leaving Gori in two days . Joint patrol efforts by the Russian Army and Georgian police in Gori soon broke down . The next day , Russian forces pushed to about 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) from Tbilisi and stopped in <unk> at the same time as Condoleezza Rice was received by Georgian president Saakashvili . 
 Russian forces turned back some humanitarian aid missions trying to help civilians , with only the United Nations ( UN ) managing to bring limited food provisions to the city . The situation in Gori was assessed as " desperate " by the UN . Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) reported that its researchers interviewed Georgians from Gori and the surrounding villages ; those Georgians reported South Ossetian militias assaulting their automobiles and kidnapping civilians trying to escape attacks on their homes after the Russian advance . HRW was told by villagers in the region by telephone that they observed looting and arson by South Ossetian militias ; however , after finding out about assaults on those who did escape , the Georgians did not dare to leave . 
 The occupation lasted until 22 August , when Russian troops left and Georgian police re @-@ entered the city . Georgia 's main east @-@ west highway was effectively reopened . 
 = = = Abkhaz front = = = 
 A naval confrontation took place between Russian and Georgian ships on 10 August . According to the Russian Ministry of Defence , the Russian navy sank one Georgian vessel after four Georgian missile boats had attacked the Russian Navy ships off the coast of Abkhazia . The Russian patrol ship <unk> was probably responsible for the sinking . The Georgian coast was blockaded by vessels of the Russian Black Sea Fleet on 10 August . The Black Sea Fleet , which participated in the military conflict for the first time since 1945 , had probably departed from Sevastopol before full @-@ scale hostilities between Russia and Georgia began . 
 Abkhaz forces opened a second front by attacking the Kodori Gorge , held by Georgia . Abkhaz artillery and aircraft began a bombardment against Georgian forces in the upper Kodori Gorge on 9 August . Three days later , a military offensive against the Kodori Gorge was officially initiated by Abkhaz separatists . Russian paratroopers supported the Abkhaz troops . Abkhaz foreign minister Sergei <unk> said that " Russian troops were not involved " in the operation . Abkhaz defence official said that Georgian forces were pushed out of the Kodori Gorge by the operation . Casualties were light on both sides ; Abkhaz fighters accidentally killed one of their comrades , and two Georgian soldiers were also killed . About 2 @,@ 000 people living in the Kodori Gorge fled . 
 Russian forces advanced into western Georgia from Abkhazia on 11 August . This marked the opening of a new front . Russian troops captured the police stations in Zugdidi despite earlier Russian official claims of not intending to expand assault to Georgia proper . Russian forces reached the town of Senaki that day and captured a military base there . 
 = = = Occupation of Poti = = = 
 Poti is the crucial port of Georgia on the Black Sea and serves as an essential entry point for Transcaucasia and the landlocked nations of Central Asia . Russian aircraft bombed the town of Poti on 8 August , causing the port to be closed for two days . Russia positioned ships in the vicinity of Poti and other Georgian ports on 10 August 2008 . The next day , Georgian and Russian representatives said that Russian troops had entered Poti ( although Russia claimed it had only sent a task force for surveying the area ) . On 13 August , six Georgian naval vessels were sunk by Russian troops in Poti . Russian deputy chief of the General staff , Anatoliy Nogovitsyn , denied the Russian presence in the port the following day . On 19 August , Russian forces took twenty @-@ one Georgian soldiers prisoner and grabbed five US Humvees in Poti , taking them to a military base occupied by Russian troops in Senaki . The Wall Street Journal said that Russian actions in Poti constituted an additional attack on Georgian economy . 
 = = = Bombing of Tbilisi = = = 
 During the fighting in South Ossetia , the Russian Air Force repeatedly attacked Tbilisi and its surrounding areas . On 8 August , the Georgian Interior Ministry reported that two bombs were dropped on <unk> Military Base near the city . A Georgian military airstrip in <unk> was bombed , killing three people . Georgian officials said on 9 August that Russian air attacks had targeted the Baku – Tbilisi – Ceyhan pipeline , but missed . Correspondents for Reuters in Tbilisi reported hearing three loud bangs in the early @-@ morning hours of 10 August and a Georgian Interior Ministry senior representative said that three bombs were dropped on Tbilisi International Airport by Russian jets . Construction plant near the airport was also bombed by Russia that day . A civilian radar station in Tbilisi was bombed the following day . Although an end to hostilities was announced on 12 August , Russian air attacks in Georgia continued through the day . The Wall Street Journal reported on 14 August that reporter had witnessed 45 craters near " oil and gas pipelines bringing fuel to the West " ( intersection of Baku – Tbilisi – Ceyhan pipeline and Baku – <unk> Pipeline south of Tbilisi ) . 
 = = = Media and cyber war = = = 
 The war was accompanied by a media battle between Russia and Georgia . The Russian military brought Russian journalists to the combat zone to report news discrediting Georgia and portraying Russia as the saviour of Russian citizens in the conflict zone . Russia also aired television footage supporting its actions which had a strong effect on the local populations of South Ossetia and Abkhazia . In a first for Russia , a Russian Armed Forces spokesman was provided by the Russian authorities to give television interviews about the war . Despite these tactics and domestic success , the Russian information campaign against Georgia was not successful internationally . In response to the information war , the Georgian government halted the broadcasting of Russian television channels in Georgia and blocked access to Russian websites . The information skirmishes between Georgia and Russia continued after armed hostilities had ended . According to political scientist Svante Cornell , the Kremlin spent millions in an international information campaign to blame Georgia for the war ; however there is abundant evidence , including some in Russian media , that Russia actually started the war . 
 During the war , hackers attacked Georgian government and news websites and disabled host servers . Some Russian news websites were also attacked . Some experts noted this as the first time in history that a notable cyberattack and an actual military engagement happened at the same time . 
 = = Ceasefire agreement = = 
 On 12 August , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev announced that he had ordered the cessation of the " peace enforcement " operation in Georgia . " The operation has achieved its goal , security for peacekeepers and civilians has been restored . The aggressor was punished , suffering huge losses . " Later that day he met French President Nicolas Sarkozy ( the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the European Union ) and approved a six @-@ point peace plan . The plan originally had four points , but Russia insisted on an additional two . Georgia requested that the additions be <unk> ; Russia objected and Sarkozy prevailed upon Saakashvili to sign the agreement . According to Sarkozy and Saakashvili , a sixth point in the Sarkozy plan was removed with Medvedev 's consent . On 14 August , South Ossetian President Eduard Kokoity and Abkhaz President Sergei <unk> also signed the peace plan . The following day Condoleezza Rice travelled to Tbilisi , where Saakashvili signed the plan in her presence . On 16 August , Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed the peace plan . 
 The peace plan embodied the following principles ( rejected additions are <unk> ) : 
 No recourse to the use of force 
 Definitive cessation of hostilities 
 Free access to humanitarian aid ( and to allow the return of refugees ) 
 Georgian military forces must withdraw to their normal bases of encampment 
 Russian military forces must withdraw to the lines prior to the start of hostilities . While awaiting an international mechanism , Russian peacekeeping forces will implement additional security measures ( six months ) 
 Opening of international discussions on the modalities of lasting security in Abkhazia and South Ossetia ( based on the decisions of the U.N. and the <unk> ) 
 After the ceasefire was signed , hostilities did not immediately end . Noting that civilians were fleeing before advancing Russian tanks , soldiers and irregulars , a reporter for The Guardian wrote on 13 August that " the idea there is a ceasefire is ridiculous " . 
 On 8 September , Sarkozy and Medvedev signed a new agreement on a Russian withdrawal from Georgia . After meeting with the French president , Medvedev said the withdrawal depended on guarantees that Georgia would not use force ; his troops would pull out " from the zones adjacent to South Ossetia and Abkhazia to the line preceding the start of hostilities " . However , a withdrawal of troops from South Ossetia or Abkhazia was not announced .

 = = = Russian withdrawal = = = 
 On 17 August , Medvedev announced that Russian forces would begin to pull out of Georgia the following day . The two countries exchanged Prisoners of War on 19 August . A Georgian official said that although his country exchanged five Russian servicemen for fifteen Georgians ( including two civilians ) , Georgia suspected that Russia still held two more Georgians . On 22 August , Russian forces withdrew from <unk> and the Georgian police proceeded towards Gori . Russia claimed that its military withdrawal was completed ; however , Russian checkpoints remained near Gori and two Russian lookout stations remained near Poti . On 13 September , Russian troops began withdrawing from western Georgia and by 11 : 00 Moscow Time , the posts near Poti were abandoned . Withdrawals from Senaki and Khobi also took place . Russian forces withdrew from the buffer zones adjacent to Abkhazia and South Ossetia on 8 October and authority over them was transferred to the European Union monitoring mission in Georgia . 
 Russia continued to maintain a single checkpoint in the border village of <unk> . On 12 December , Russian forces withdrew ; eight hours later they re @-@ entered the village and Georgian police withdrew after the Russians threatened to fire . Russian forces then setup three checkpoints in the village . On 18 October 2010 all Russian troops in <unk> withdrew to South Ossetia and a Georgian Army unit moved in . 
 On 9 September 2008 , Russia announced that its troops in South Ossetia and Abkhazia would remain under bilateral agreements with their respective de facto governments . Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that a military presence in Abkhazia and South Ossetia was essential to prevent Georgia from regaining control . Georgia considers Abkhazia and South Ossetia Russian @-@ occupied territories . In November 2011 , the European Parliament passed a resolution recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia as occupied Georgian territories . 
 = = = Recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia by Russia = = = 
 On 25 August 2008 , the Russian parliament unanimously voted in favour of a motion urging President Medvedev to recognise Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states . On 26 August , Medvedev signed decrees recognising the two states , saying that recognising the independence of the two entities " represents the only possibility to save human lives . " 
 The recognition by Russia was condemned by the United States , France , the secretary @-@ general of the Council of Europe , the president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe , the OSCE chairman , NATO and the G7 on the grounds that it violated Georgia 's territorial integrity , United Nations Security Council resolutions and the ceasefire agreement . In response to Russia 's action , the Georgian government severed diplomatic relations with Russia . 
 Russia sought support for its recognition from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation . However , because of concerns about separatist regions in SCO states ( especially China ) , the organisation did not support recognition . 
 = = = International monitors = = = 
 The mandate of the OSCE mission in Georgia expired on 1 January 2009 , after Russia vetoed its extension . OSCE monitors had been denied access to South Ossetia since the war . The mandate of the UNOMIG expired on 16 June 2009 ; its extension was also vetoed by Russia , which argued that the mandate did not properly reflect Russia 's position of recognising Abkhazia as an independent state . According to UN mission head Johan Verbeke , about 60 @,@ 000 ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia became vulnerable after the mission 's end . 
 As of 5 January 2015 , 259 European Union Monitoring Mission ( <unk> ) monitors operate in Georgia and 2 in Brussels . Russia does not allow <unk> monitors into Abkhazia and South Ossetia . 
 = = = Geopolitical impact = = = 
 The 2008 war was the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union that the Russian military had been used against an independent state , demonstrating Russia 's willingness to wage a full @-@ scale military campaign to attain its political objectives . The failure of the Western security system to respond swiftly to Russia 's attempt to forcibly revise the borders of an OSCE member country revealed its weaknesses . The division between Western European and Eastern European nations also became apparent over the relations with Russia . Ukraine and other post @-@ Soviet states received a clear message from the Russian leadership that the possible accession to NATO would cause a foreign invasion and the break @-@ up of the country . Effective annexation of Abkhazia was also one of Russia 's geopolitical goals . The construction of the EU @-@ sponsored Nabucco pipeline ( connecting Central Asian reserves to Europe ) in Transcaucasia was averted . 
 The war in Georgia showed Russia 's assertiveness in revising international relations and undermining the hegemony of the United States . Shortly after the war , Russian president Medvedev unveiled a five @-@ point Russian foreign policy . The Medvedev Doctrine stated that " protecting the lives and dignity of our citizens , wherever they may be , is an unquestionable priority for our country " . The presence of Russian citizens in foreign countries would form a doctrinal foundation for invasion if needed . Medvedev 's statement that there were areas in which Russia had " privileged interests " , underlined Russia 's particular interest in the former Soviet Union and the fact that Russia would feel endangered by subversion of local pro @-@ Russian regimes . 
 The war eliminated Georgia 's prospects for joining NATO . Russian President Dmitry Medvedev stated in November 2011 that NATO would have admitted former Soviet republics if Russia had not invaded Georgia . " If you ... had faltered back in 2008 , the geopolitical situation would be different now , " Medvedev declared at a <unk> military base . 
 = = Humanitarian impact and war crimes = = 
 Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) states that all parties to the war seriously violated international laws governing war , causing many civilian casualties . The South Ossetian parliament and several schools and nurseries were used as military positions or posts by South Ossetian troops and volunteer militias and targeted by Georgian artillery fire . Georgia stated that its attacks only intended to " neutralize firing positions from where Georgian positions were being targeted " . HRW documented witness accounts that civilian objects were used by South Ossetian fighters ( making them permissible military aims ) , concluding that South Ossetian fighters put civilians at risk by setting up military positions near or in civilian structures . Georgia was responsible for indiscriminate attacks , with little concern for minimising civilian risk . 
 Russia deliberately attacked fleeing civilians in South Ossetia and the Gori district of Georgia . Russian warplanes bombed civilian population centres in Georgia proper and villages of ethnic Georgians in South Ossetia . Armed militias engaged in looting , arson attacks and abductions , forcing Georgian civilians to flee . HRW said the conflict was a civilian disaster and called for international organisations to send fact @-@ finding missions to the area of conflict . It also asked for the authorities to hold people responsible for any crimes accountable . 
 The use of <unk> cluster bombs by the Georgians and <unk> 250 cluster bombs by the Russians resulted in civilian casualties . Georgia was reported to have used cluster munitions twice to hit civilians fleeing via the main escape road and admitted using cluster bombs against Russian troops and near the Roki Tunnel . Russia denied using cluster bombs . 
 HRW reported that during the war , ethnic @-@ Georgian villages in South Ossetia were burned and looted by South Ossetian militias , preventing 20 @,@ 000 displaced people from returning after the conflict . According to the Memorial society , the villages of <unk> , Kurta , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Avnevi were " virtually fully burnt down " . South Ossetian president Eduard Kokoity said in an interview that Georgian villages had been demolished and no Georgian refugees would be allowed to return . Georgian civilians willing to live in South Ossetia were coerced into obtaining a Russian passport . The EU commission said it was likely that during and after the war , an ethnic cleansing of Georgians was committed in South Ossetia . 
 Russian officials initially claimed that up to 2 @,@ 000 ethnic Ossetian civilians of Tskhinvali were killed by Georgian forces ; according to Russia , the reason for the military intervention in Georgia was this large number of casualties . Public opinion among Ossetians was impacted by claims of high casualties ; according to HRW , some Ossetian civilians said in interviews that they approved of burning and looting of Georgian villages because of the " thousands of civilian casualties in South Ossetia " reported by Russian television . In December 2008 , the figures were revised down to a total of 162 civilian casualties in South Ossetia by the Investigative Committee of the Prosecutor 's Office of the Russian Federation . 
 Georgia and South Ossetia have filed complaints about alleged war crimes committed by the other side with international courts , including the International Criminal Court , the International Court of Justice , and the European Court of Human Rights . 
 The war displaced a 192 @,@ 000 people including both Ossetians and Georgians . Many were able to return to their homes after the war , but a year later around 30 @,@ 000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced . As of May 2014 , 20 @,@ 272 persons remained displaced , with their return being blocked by de facto authorities .

 Russian actions during the war were heavily criticised by some western countries . 
 United Kingdom – British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said on 9 August , " Russia has extended the fighting today well beyond South Ossetia , attacking the Georgian port of Poti , and the town of Gori , while Abkhaz forces have been shelling Georgian positions in the Upper Kodori valley . I deplore this . " 
 United States – US president George W. Bush said , " Russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people . Such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century . " Bush later again criticised Russia , saying " Bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century . " Although the Bush administration considered a military response to defend Georgia , it decided against it so as to not provoke a conflict with Russia . Instead , the US sent humanitarian aid to Georgia on military aircraft . The Bush administration also imposed sanctions on Russia , which were revoked by the Obama administration in May 2010 . 
 Poland – The presidents of Poland , Lithuania , Estonia , Ukraine and the prime minister of Latvia ( Lech Kaczyński , Valdas Adamkus , Toomas Hendrik Ilves , Viktor Yushchenko and Ivars <unk> ) , who met with Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili at Kaczyński 's initiative , appeared at a 12 August 2008 Tbilisi rally held in front of the parliament which was attended by nearly 150 @,@ 000 people . The crowd responded enthusiastically to the Polish president 's speech , chanting " Poland , Poland " , " Friendship , Friendship " and " Georgia , Georgia " . 
 Hungary – Hungarian opposition leader Viktor <unk> drew parallels between the Russian intervention and the crushing of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 . 
 Ukraine – Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko said that he intended to increase the rent for the Russian naval base at Sevastopol in the Crimean Peninsula . 
 France and Germany took an intermediate position , abstaining from naming a guilty party : 
 European Union – On 8 August , France ( who held the rotating presidency of the European Union ) announced that the EU and the US would send a joint delegation to negotiate a ceasefire . 
 Germany – German chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her concern about the humanitarian situation in Georgia and called for an immediate ceasefire . 
 A few leaders supported Russia 's position : 
 Italy – Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini said , " We cannot create an anti @-@ Russia coalition in Europe , and on this point we are close to Putin 's position . " He emphasised that Vladimir Putin was a near partner of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi . 
 Belarus – President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko said , " Russia acted calmly , wisely and beautifully . " 
 Georgia announced on 12 August 2008 that it would leave the Commonwealth of Independent States , which it blamed for failing to avert the conflict . Its departure became effective in August 2009 . 
 According to academic Martin Malek , western countries did not feel it was necessary to aggravate relations with Russia over " tiny and insignificant " Georgia . He wrote in the Caucasian Review of International Affairs that western policy makers did not want to isolate Russia because its support was necessary to solve " international problems " . 
 = = = NATO reaction in the Black Sea = = = 
 NATO increased its naval presence in the Black Sea significantly following the Russian invasion , with ships docking in Georgian ports , and ( according to the US Navy ) delivering humanitarian aid . NATO said that its presence in the Black Sea was not related to the Georgian crisis ; its vessels were conducting typical visits and preplanned naval exercises with Romania and Bulgaria . Russian General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn reminded NATO of the limit on the number of vessels allowed in the Black Sea under the 1936 Montreux convention . Russian President Dmitry Medvedev questioned the claim that ships going to Georgia were bringing only humanitarian assistance , alleging the delivery of military material . According to political analyst Vladimir <unk> , the US maintained a continual presence in the Black Sea . The ships were rotated from time to time in the Black Sea because of the constraints on ship 's weight and length of visits set by the Montreux Convention .

 According to the Moscow Defence Brief , an English @-@ language magazine published by the Russian non @-@ governmental organisation the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies , the Georgian troops included the 2nd , 3rd and 4th Infantry Brigades , the Artillery Brigade , part of the 1st Infantry Brigade and the separate Gori Tank Battalion . Additionally , special forces and Ministry of Internal Affairs troops were deployed . The total number of troops was 16 @,@ 000 according to the magazine . According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies , ten light infantry battalions of the 2nd , 3rd and 4th infantry brigades , special forces and an artillery brigade , totalling approximately 12 @,@ 000 troops , had been concentrated by the start of the conflict . The primary task of capturing Tskhinvali was accomplished by the 4th Brigade with support from the 2nd and 3rd Brigades . According to the EU fact @-@ finding mission , 10 @,@ 000 – 11 @,@ 000 soldiers took part in the war . 
 The 1st Infantry Brigade , the only one trained to NATO standards , was serving in Iraq at the beginning of the war ; on 11 August , the United States Air Force airlifted it to Georgia .

 United States officials said that " one of the few effective elements of the [ Georgia ] ' s military " was air defence , with the analysts crediting the SA @-@ 11 Buk @-@ 1M with shooting down a Tupolev @-@ 22M bomber and contributing to the loss of some Su @-@ 25s . This view was supported by independent Russian analysis . Colonel @-@ General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn , Russian deputy chief of general staff , said the Soviet @-@ made Tor and Buk anti @-@ aircraft missile systems , bought by Georgia from Ukraine , were responsible for downing Russian aircraft during the war . A Russian assessment , reported by Roger McDermott , said that Russian losses would have been significantly higher if the Georgians had not left behind a portion of their Buk @-@ M1 systems near Senaki ( in western Georgia ) and several Osa missile launchers in South Ossetia . According to some reports , Georgia also possessed a battery of the Israeli @-@ made <unk> @-@ SR short @-@ range self @-@ propelled anti @-@ aircraft system . The Georgian air @-@ defence early @-@ warning and command @-@ control tactical system was connected via Turkey to a NATO Air Situation Data Exchange ( <unk> ) , which provided Georgia with intelligence during the conflict . 
 Georgia has said that its key vulnerabilities were ineffective communication during action and its weaker air strength . Konstantin <unk> of CAST saw substandard training of pilots as the primary reason for the poor performance of Georgian air sorties . According to Georgian first deputy defence minister Batu <unk> , Georgia needed a complex , multi @-@ layered air @-@ defence system to protect its airspace . However , Western military officers experienced with Georgian military forces suggested that Georgia 's military shortcomings were too great to be eliminated by new equipment acquisitions . According to a 2 September 2008 New York Times article , " Georgia 's Army fled ahead of the Russian Army 's advance , turning its back and leaving Georgian civilians in an enemy 's path . Its planes did not fly after the first few hours of contact . Its navy was sunk in the harbor , and its patrol boats were hauled away by Russian trucks on trailers . " 
 According to a Western military officer , Georgian logistical preparations were mediocre and there was interference between units during the action . Exercises simulating combat against a probable enemy ( the 58th Army ) had never been organised by the Georgian Army . During the war , communications broke down in the mountains and troops had to resort to mobile phones . There was insufficient planning ; according to Giorgi <unk> , nobody thought of how to seal the Roki Tunnel . There was a dismal organisation of the delivery of 10 @,@ 000 Georgian reservists in Gori on 9 August ; they had no specific targets and went back to Tbilisi the following day . The conflict was called by journalists as the war " that was hidden from history " because there was very little video recording of military action . According to their American trainers , Georgian soldiers were unprepared for combat despite having " warrior spirit " . There were few well @-@ trained , educated officers in high ranking positions , and Saakashvili 's government had no military experience . 
 = = = = Russia = = = = 
 The Russian Command , Control , Communications and Intelligence ( C ³ I ) performed poorly during the conflict . The Russian communication systems were outdated , with a 58th Army commander allegedly making contact with his combat troops via a journalist @-@ owned satellite phone . Without the modern <unk> , precision @-@ guided munitions could not be used ; the US @-@ controlled GPS was unavailable , since the war zone was blacked out . Due to the negligence of Russian defence minister , the use of unmanned aerial vehicles was not authorised ; an RIA Novosti editorial said that Russian forces lacked reliable aerial @-@ reconnaissance systems , once using a Tupolev Tu @-@ 22M3 bomber instead . However , Russian reconnaissance battalions and regiments were also deployed during the war . General Anatoly Nogovitsyn , deputy chief of the General staff , said that during the war , new weapons were not tried out . 
 The RIA Novosti editorial also said that Russian Su @-@ 25 ground @-@ attack jets did not have radar sights and ground @-@ target coordinate computing . They also did not have long @-@ range surface @-@ to @-@ air missiles that could be launched beyond the air @-@ defence zones of an adversary . Opposition @-@ affiliated Russian analyst Konstantin <unk> observed the poor performance of the Russian Air Force : " It is totally unbelievable that the Russian Air Force was unable to establish air superiority almost to the end of the five @-@ day war , despite the fact that the enemy had no fighter aviation . " 
 According to Russian expert Anton Lavrov , on 8 August , Russian and South Ossetian troops deployed in South Ossetia were unaware that Russian aviation was involved in the war . Russian troops and South Ossetians often assessed Russian aircraft as hostile and fired at them before precise identification took place . On 8 August , the air force performed 63 flights in support of Russian ground troops . A total of six Russian aircraft were lost during the war : one Su @-@ <unk> , two Su @-@ <unk> , two Su @-@ <unk> and one Tu @-@ 22M3 ; friendly fire was the cause of the downing of three planes . Lavrov denied that the Tu @-@ 22M was used for reconnaissance . 
 The relationship between the North Caucasus Military District commander and the air force and their roles in commanding were unclear . Colonel @-@ General Aleksandr Zelin , commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Air Force did not set foot in the command post , instead running Air @-@ force operations on a mobile phone from his office without any help from his air @-@ defence assistants . The air force was accused of rendering no assistance to land campaign . 
 Swedish analysts Carolina <unk> <unk> and Fredrik Westerlund said that although the Russian Black Sea Fleet did not meet significant resistance , it proved effective at implementing elaborate manoeuvres . Mechanised infantry opened a second front in Abkhazia , which contributed to the rapidity of the Russian military victory . 
 Heritage Foundation researchers said in their assessment of the preparation of Russian general @-@ staff that the operations were planned and implemented effectively , with a strategic surprise being engineered by the Russians . A Reuters analyst described Russia 's army as " strong but flawed " ; the war demonstrated that Russia 's " armed forces have emerged from years of neglect as a formidable fighting force , but revealed important deficiencies . " He stated that due to these weaknesses , Russia fell short of its image of a world @-@ class military power . Unlike the Second Chechen War , Russia 's force in Georgia was composed primarily of professional soldiers instead of conscripts . Reuters journalists in Georgia stated that they saw the Russian forces to be well @-@ equipped and disciplined forces . CAST director Ruslan <unk> said that " the victory over the Georgian army ... should become for Russia not a cause for euphoria and excessive joy , but serve to speed up military transformations . " Roger McDermott wrote that slight differences in criticism by civilian media or official sources after the conflict was " an orchestrated effort by the government to ' sell ' reform to the military and garner support among the populace . " 
 However , the Russian Army 's transformation into a professional army was not deemed as successful . In September 2008 , General Vladimir <unk> acknowledged that many of the professional soldiers did not have better training than the conscripts . Russian Airborne Troops and special forces conducted most of the land fighting . Due to the Russian Air Force 's inability to penetrate Georgian air defence , airborne troops could not be airlifted behind Georgian lines . An ambush of a ground @-@ troop commander , in which only five of thirty vehicles in his convoy survived , indicated intelligence and surveillance negligence . Many Russian land units reportedly had an insufficient ammunition supply .

 After the ceasefire was signed on 12 August , in Georgia proper , Russian troops attempted to seize and destroy Georgian armament , a process termed by the Moscow Defence Brief as the " demilitarization of the Georgian Armed Forces " . After the war Stratfor states that Russia " has largely destroyed Georgia 's war @-@ fighting capability " . According to Moscow Defence Brief , Georgia lost its air and naval forces and its air @-@ defence systems . The Georgian army lost large quantities of equipment to the Russians during the conflict . Russian Ground Forces official Igor <unk> said that the Russians captured 65 Georgian tanks , over 20 of which were destroyed because they were beyond repair or too old . Russia estimated that the Georgian Air Force lost three Su @-@ 25 attack aircraft and two L @-@ 29 jets . A Russian air attack on <unk> Air Force Base destroyed three AN @-@ 2 aircraft . Russian airborne forces set fire to two Mi @-@ 24 helicopters and one Mi @-@ 14 on 11 August . Georgian Defence Minister Davit <unk> said that Georgia lost materiel worth $ 250 million . According to Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili , his country saved 95 percent of its armed forces . The 4th Brigade had more casualties than any other Georgian military unit . 
 In 2009 , Russian Army Chief of General Staff Nikolai Makarov stated that Georgia was rearming , although the armament was not directly provided by the United States . According to Makarov , the Georgian Armed Forces had exceeded their pre @-@ war strength by 2009 . 
 Russia admitted that three of its Su @-@ 25 strike aircraft and one Tu @-@ 22M3 long @-@ range bomber were lost , in addition to at least three tanks , 20 armoured and 20 non @-@ armoured vehicles . Moscow Defence Brief provided a higher estimate , saying that Russian Air Force total losses during the war were one Tu @-@ 22M3 long @-@ range bomber , one Su @-@ 24M Fencer fighter @-@ bomber , one Su @-@ <unk> Fencer E reconnaissance plane and four Su @-@ 25 attack planes . Anton Lavrov listed one Su @-@ <unk> , two Su @-@ <unk> , two Su @-@ 24M and one Tu @-@ 22M3 lost . According to <unk> Gazeta , the five @-@ day war cost Russia an estimated 12 @.@ 5 billion rubles , a daily cost of 2 @.@ 5 billion rubles .

 In the opening scene , Carter reveals that he has never had a bachelor party , leading Peter to profess that he will help solve Carter 's dilemma , just as Hamburger Helper helped him . Peter is then introduced to the Hamburger Helper mascot Helping Hand , as well as his mentally challenged brother — Cheeseburger Helper — who insists on adding cheese to the meal . After taking Carter to the Quahog strip club , Peter decides to pay a mistress to give him a lapdance , causing Carter to suffer a heart attack from sexual arousal . This then prompts Quagmire to ask what is wrong with him , to which Carter replies that he is having " a heart attack @-@ ack @-@ ack @-@ ack @-@ ack @-@ ack ! You oughta know by now ! , " which is taken from a line in the Billy Joel song " Movin ' Out ( Anthony 's Song ) " . The bedtime story that Peter refers to when talking to Lois about how she makes him sad is the " Story of Little Suck @-@ a @-@ Thumb " from the German children 's book Struwwelpeter . 
 Returning home from firing the board of directors , Peter calls attention to Lacey Chabert , formerly the voice of Meg Griffin before being replaced by Mila Kunis , when he notes that he can also fire Lois for " misbehaving . " In introducing new products for Pewterschmidt Industries , Peter decides to create several unorthodox items , which include a cereal line for Jeremy Irons entitled " Jeremy Irons Cereal , " a " Scream in a Box , " as well as an African American heart rate monitor , which Carter later uses at the hospital , with the system 's two settings , Barry White , and Bill Cosby 's impersonated voices .

 = Leschi ( fireboat ) = 
 Leschi , named for the native American leader Chief Leschi , is a fireboat operated by the Seattle Fire Department . The ship was laid down in 2006 and commissioned in 2007 ; its sponsor was Sharon Nickels , wife of the then @-@ mayor Greg Nickels . 
 The 108 @-@ foot ( 33 m ) Leschi has been described as the " dreadnought of Seattle 's fireboat fleet " . Carrying a normal complement of four , its mission includes firefighting , search and rescue , and response to chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear , and explosive ( <unk> ) emergencies . It can also be used as a mobile pump and fuel station and as emergency medical treatment and command center . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Seattle is one of the largest ports on the United States west coast and waterfront fires have been a continual concern for the city . Since 1891 the Seattle Fire Department has regularly operated at least two fireboats , which can be augmented by ships and small craft with fire suppression capabilities from the U.S. Coast Guard , Seattle Police , and neighboring municipalities . One of the worst maritime fires in the city 's history occurred in 1968 when an electrical malfunction at Todd Shipyards sparked a fire that took 14 engine companies , two fireboats , two U.S. Coast Guard cutters , and several conscripted Foss Maritime tugboats more than half @-@ a @-@ day to extinguish . 
 In the 1970s the United States Maritime Administration funded a special program to train a contingent of 50 Seattle firefighters to provide land @-@ based support in the control and extinguishing of dockside and shipboard <unk> . The effort , which was studied by the Stanford Research Institute , later became a model for other waterfront cities . 
 = = = Procurement = = = 
 Prior to Leschi 's construction , Seattle 's flagship firefighting vessel was the aging Alki , which was built in 1927 and operated alongside a newer vessel , Chief Seattle . Once known as the world 's third " most powerful fireboat , " by the early 2000s the antique Alki had become increasingly difficult to operate . On one occasion , in 2003 , an engine problem left the vessel dead in the water and the ship was only able to move by firing its legendarily powerful water cannons . 
 Procurement of a modern fireboat to replace Alki was part of a successful public safety levy enacted by Seattle voters in 2003 approving its construction . Leschi was built at a cost of $ 12 million by Dakota Creek Industries of Anacortes , Washington , from a design by Jensen Marine Consultants . The Seattle Fire Department took delivery of the vessel in 2007 during a commissioning ceremony attended by mayor Greg Nickels . The ship sponsor was Nickels ' wife , Sharon . The name , Leschi , had been suggested by Kadi Camara , a Seattle elementary school student , as part of a naming competition held by the city . It was meant to honor a former Nisqually chief . Camara got to ride on the ship as a prize . Following the commissioning of Leschi , Alki was retired . Leschi is berthed on Elliott Bay where it is the primary response vehicle for maritime fires on the city 's outer shoreline . 
 = = Design and specifications = = 
 Described as the " dreadnought of Seattle 's fireboat fleet , " Leschi is one of three such vessels currently operated by the Seattle Fire Department ( <unk> ) , the others being Chief Seattle and Marine One . The 108 @-@ foot ( 33 m ) Leschi is powered by twin diesel engines rated at 1 @,@ 550 @-@ horsepower ( 1 @,@ 160 kW ) turning 72 @-@ inch ( 1 @,@ 800 mm ) four @-@ blade propellers , which give the ship a flank speed of 14 knots . Two additional engines , rated at 1 @,@ 440 @-@ horsepower ( 1 @,@ 070 kW ) , power the ship 's four water pumps . Unlike its predecessor , Alki , Leschi has touchscreen consoles for bridge command controls instead of manual " knobs and levers " . By displacement and pump capacity , it is the largest of ten municipal @-@ owned fireboats that support the U.S. Coast Guard 's regional marine firefighting plan for Puget Sound . 
 = = Mission and capabilities = = 
 According to Professional Mariner , Leschi 's mission is " firefighting , mobile platform for emergency medical treatment and command center , mobile pump and fuel station , and response to chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear , and explosive ( <unk> ) emergencies " 
 The ship 's principal fire suppression equipment comes in the form of four 5 @,@ 000 @-@ US @-@ gallon ( 19 @,@ 000 l ; 4 @,@ 200 imp gal ) per @-@ minute water pumps . In addition to pumping water , the ship 's firefighting apparatus can tap an integrated 6 @,@ 000 @-@ US @-@ gallon ( 23 @,@ 000 l ; 5 @,@ 000 imp gal ) foam tank for use against chemical @-@ fueled fires . Leschi also has a 55 @-@ foot ( 17 m ) telescoping crane with ladder and fire line for use against container ship fires and the ship is able to douse itself with a cooling fog to allow for operation directly adjacent to a major fire . 
 In addition to marine firefighting , Leschi can support land @-@ based firefighters in the event of a disaster that destroys Seattle 's water mains . Manifolds on Leschi 's deck provide ports through which hose lines can be run to provide fire engines with direct access to seawater . 
 Leschi is designed to operate with a complement of four personnel , but has a command and communications room for use by senior <unk> officers in the event of a catastrophe that renders land facilities unusable . The ship is outfitted with a CBRN defense system for crew protection in the event of a nuclear or chemical weapons attack against Seattle , or similar disaster . When activated , the system automatically seals pressurized hatches to the bridge and command center ; uncontaminated air is provided by a fan and filter system . 
 The ship is regularly equipped with a rigid @-@ hulled inflatable boat that can be launched from the ship 's stern . A thermal imaging camera system allows the ship 's crew to locate distressed persons in the water ( such as in a man overboard emergency ) at night or during other low @-@ visibility conditions . 
 = 2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championship = 
 The 2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championship was the final race of the 2011 IZOD IndyCar series schedule . The event took place at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in Clark County , Nevada on October 16 , 2011 . The race was stopped following a major accident triggered by drivers trying to avoid light contact between Wade Cunningham and James Hinchcliffe . 15 cars were involved in the wreck , which resulted in the death of two @-@ time Indianapolis 500 winner and 2005 series champion Dan Wheldon . After a several hour delay , IndyCar decided to abandon the remaining 188 laps after word of Wheldon 's death was relayed to the drivers .

 The Las Vegas race was added to the schedule for the 2011 season and replaced the event at Homestead @-@ Miami Speedway as the final race of the IndyCar season . The races at Homestead and the International Speedway Corporation tracks were removed from the schedule following the previous year 's season . Las Vegas Motor Speedway was returning to the IndyCar schedule for the first time since 2000 – and the first open @-@ wheel race at the circuit since the Hurricane Relief 400 Champ Car event in 2005 – and none of the drivers in the race had raced at the circuit since it was reconfigured in 2006 , which saw a greater degree of banking added to the circuit to encourage side @-@ by @-@ side racing . The race was scheduled for 200 laps around the 1 @.@ 544 mi ( 2 @.@ 485 km ) oval , totaling 308 @.@ 800 mi ( 496 @.@ 965 km ) . 
 = = = The $ 5 Million Challenge = = = 
 On May 3 , 2011 , IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard announced that a $ 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( USD ) purse would be awarded to any driver who was not a regular on the IndyCar circuit to enter the race at Las Vegas and win while starting from the tail end of the field , hoping to attract interest from Formula 1 or NASCAR . The challenge was accepted by 2011 Indianapolis 500 winner Dan Wheldon , who had run only one additional race that season ; he agreed to split the purse with a fan if he went on to win . 
 = = = Championship battle = = = 
 Entering the race there was a two @-@ way battle for the IndyCar Championship between Chip Ganassi Racing 's Dario Franchitti and Team Penske 's Will Power . Franchitti was 18 points ahead of Power , retaking the championship points lead from him with a second @-@ place finish at the 2011 Kentucky Indy 300 two weeks prior . Power was still mathematically in the points race despite an awful finish at Kentucky , but needed to finish far ahead of Franchitti in order to win the championship title . 
 The race 's honorary grand marshal was skateboarder Tony Hawk , who gave the command to start the engines . 
 = = = Qualifying = = = 
 A total of thirty @-@ four cars qualified for the race . Tony Kanaan , driving the No. 82 Dallara for KV Racing Technology , qualified on the pole for the race and shared the front row with Oriol <unk> , driving the No. 2 Dallara for Newman / Haas Racing . Danica Patrick , driving the No. 7 Dallara for Andretti Autosport , started 9th in what was her final IndyCar start before joining NASCAR . The two remaining championship contenders qualified on row 9 , with Power 17th in the No. 12 Dallara and Franchitti 18th in the No. 10 Dallara . In addition to Wheldon 's No. 77 Dallara , which he piloted for Sam Schmidt Motorsports , Buddy Rice was forced to start from the rear of the field when he received a penalty in qualifying for driving the No. 44 Dallara below the track 's white line . 
 = = = Lap 11 crash = = = 
 The accident began on the front straightaway as the field headed into turn one . Wade Cunningham , Wheldon 's teammate in the No. 17 Dallara , clipped James Hinchcliffe , driving the No. 06 Dallara , and then made contact with J. R. Hildebrand in the No. 4 Dallara . Then Cunningham swerved and Hildebrand drove over the rear of his car , causing his to go airborne . Cunningham collected Jay Howard in the No. 15 Service Central Dallara on the inside and then Townsend Bell in the No. 22 Dallara on the outside before colliding with the retaining wall . Attempting to avoid the crash ahead , Vitor Meira lost control of his No. 14 Dallara and spun inward , collecting both Charlie Kimball 's No. 83 Dallara and E. J. Viso 's No. 59 Dallara . Tomas Scheckter , in the No. 57 Dallara , was also attempting to avoid the crash by rapidly slowing down on the outside . Following that , Paul Tracy ran into the back of his car with his No. 9 Motegi Wheels Dallara and Pippa Mann , rapidly approaching in the No. 30 Dallara , went over the top of him after jerking to the outside to avoid crashing into Alex Lloyd in the No. 19 Dallara . 
 As cars continued to drive through the accident scene , the No. 77 car driven by Wheldon and the No. 12 driven by Power left the racing surface . Wheldon was racing at 220 miles per hour ( 350 km / h ) when he came upon the scene , frantically trying to avoid the collision . Although he was able to considerably slow it down , Wheldon 's car went airborne about 325 feet ( 99 m ) after running into the back of Kimball 's and went barrel @-@ rolling into the catch fence cockpit @-@ first , causing his head to hit one of the poles . The No. 77 landed back on the racing surface having been sliced apart by the fence and slid to a stop next to the <unk> barrier . Power , meanwhile , went airborne when he ran over the back of Lloyd 's car and struck the <unk> barrier . The car landed sideways on the track and rolled over , which caused the front wheel assembly to break ; one of the front tires flew over Power 's head and barely missed hitting him . 
 A total of 15 cars were involved , with the most severe injuries suffered by Wheldon , Power , Hildebrand , and Mann . Wheldon was extricated from his car and was airlifted to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada . He was officially pronounced dead on arrival two hours later at 1 : 54 PM Pacific Daylight Time . The official cause of Wheldon 's death was given by the Clark County Coroner as blunt force trauma to his head due to the incident . Mann and Hildebrand were later taken to the hospital for overnight observation , while Power was evaluated and released that day . 
 After one additional lap had been run , IndyCar officials red @-@ flagged the race as the track was not suitable for racing . In addition to the debris left by the fifteen cars involved in the wreck , the asphalt surface was damaged and the catch fencing needed repair . As the teams waited to see if they would resume racing , they also were waiting for word on Wheldon 's condition as word had not been relayed to the track . 
 Sometime around 3 : 00 PM local time , an emergency drivers ' meeting was called by series director Brian Barnhart . After the meeting ended , Randy Bernard met with the media . In his brief statement , Bernard told reporters about Wheldon 's death and that , out of respect , the drivers and teams agreed not to continue the race and instead decided to pay tribute to their fallen colleague with a five @-@ lap salute . 
 The 19 drivers who survived the crash scene returned to their cars , and every crew member stood silently in their pit boxes . The scoring pylon was blanked except for the top position , where the No. 77 was displayed . The remaining cars lined up three abreast on pit road , as in the Indy 500 starting formation , with Kanaan , Ed Carpenter in the No. 67 Dallara , and Ryan Briscoe in the Dallara leading . Only eighteen of the drivers participated . Out of respect for Wheldon 's death , the No. 98 Dallara fielded by Bryan Herta Autosport was parked . The car was driven to victory in Indianapolis by Wheldon and its driver on this day , Alex Tagliani , normally drove the No. 77 car that Wheldon had taken over 
 The pace car then led the cars back onto the track while every crew member and person behind the wall moved to the grass separating pit road from the track to watch . The track loudspeakers <unk> renditions of " Danny Boy " and " Amazing Grace " played on bagpipes while the cars went around the track at pace lap speed , and each time the cars passed the start / finish line the fans remaining in the front @-@ stretch grandstand offered applause . At the end of the five tribute laps , the starter waved two checkered flags to signify the end while the cars proceeded around the track one more time before exiting for the pits in turn four . 
 Wheldon 's death was the first suffered by an IndyCar driver since Paul Dana was killed in a race @-@ morning practice crash at Homestead @-@ Miami in 2006 . 
 = = Championship resolution = = 
 Since the race was abandoned after twelve total laps , it did not reach official status ; IndyCar does not consider a race official unless it reaches the halfway mark . As such , no points were awarded and the series championship went to Dario Franchitti by default . If the race had continued and reached official status , Franchitti would have been the series champion anyway ; due to his involvement in the crash that resulted in the race being stopped , Will Power 's car was destroyed and he would not have been able to continue racing . 
 This was Franchitti 's third consecutive and fourth overall championship . Indy Racing League , LLC delayed all official <unk> , choosing instead to conduct it during the annual State of <unk> speech in February 2012 ; Franchitti also delayed his own celebration of his championship victory . 
 = = Reactions = = 
 At the time of his death , Wheldon had been working with IndyCar officials to develop the <unk> chassis with the intention of improving safety in the sport . Planned changes to the chassis include larger cockpits for driver protection and bodywork over the rear wheels to prevent cars from launching off one another in the event of a collision , long a problem in open @-@ wheel racing , regardless of oval or road course , but troublesome on high @-@ speed ovals and tight street circuits with a long straight and a tight turn , similar to the style of many modern road courses . 
 Prominent figures within the IndyCar fraternity and the wider international motorsport community expressed their condolences to Wheldon and his family . Wheldon had been scheduled to take part in the Gold Coast 600 , a round of the V8 Supercars championship , on October 22 , racing alongside his friend James Courtney . Upon hearing of Wheldon 's death , Courtney described the accident as a sobering reminder of the dangers faced by racing drivers . As the first major international motorsport event after Wheldon 's death , organizers of the V8 Supercars series planned a series of tributes to him at the Gold Coast 600 . Wheldon 's place was taken by another British driver , Darren Turner , an FIA GT1 World Championship competitor . Wheldon 's name was left on the car as a mark of respect , while British drivers at the event paid tribute to him with helmet decals , and several other drivers planned individual tributes to Wheldon . Kanaan , who had also been scheduled to race in Australia , announced his withdrawal from the event out of respect for Wheldon . However , Briscoe , Tagliani , and Hélio Castroneves , all of whom raced at Las Vegas , along with other part @-@ time IndyCar drivers Sébastien Bourdais and Simon Pagenaud , who were not at Las Vegas , did race . Bourdais , the best performing " International " driver , received the Dan Wheldon Memorial Trophy . Sam Schmidt , for whom Wheldon had been racing at the time of his accident , admitted that the events at Las Vegas Motor Speedway had prompted him to re @-@ evaluate his involvement in motorsports . Similarly , veteran drivers Davey Hamilton and Paul Tracy said they were considering retiring from racing on the back of the accident . 
 In the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series , several drivers at the 2011 Good Sam Club 500 at Talladega on the weekend after Wheldon 's death put special tributes on their cars , like NASCAR issuing the " Lionheart Knight " decal Wheldon wore on his helmet , which were placed on the cars ' b @-@ pillars , along with T. J. Bell putting Wheldon 's name on the <unk> . 
 Driver Marco Andretti withdrew from The Celebrity Apprentice , which started taping days after the incident , and was replaced by his father Michael , team principal of Andretti Autosport . 
 On December 9 , 2011 , IndyCar decided that they were not going to return to Las Vegas for the 2012 season . Randy Bernard expressed reluctance to return to the speedway following Wheldon 's death , despite the insistence of Speedway Motorsports , Inc. president Bruton Smith ( who owns the track in Las Vegas as well as three other tracks used by the IndyCar series ) for the series to honor its three @-@ year contract with the track . As of that date , the investigation into the accident was still ongoing . IndyCar was holding back on the release of its 2012 schedule until the investigation concluded . The IndyCar series also conducted an investigation into whether or not the series should continue racing on high @-@ banked ovals such as Las Vegas and Texas Motor Speedway in Denton , Texas . Texas had been one of the staples of the IndyCar series since 1997 and had yet to be confirmed for 2012 prior to the Las Vegas race in 2011 . Indycar 's future at high @-@ banked ovals was in jeopardy pending the results of the investigation . Texas was eventually placed on the 2012 schedule . 
 The series went to new restrictions on restarts . IndyCar announced that restarts would only be single @-@ file in 2012 , rather than double @-@ file as they had been the previous season . 
 = = = Criticism = = = 
 In the build @-@ up to the race , several drivers expressed unease at the race – with Franchitti , Oriol <unk> and Alex Lloyd the most vocal opponents – particularly given the high degree of banking around the circuit , with between 18 and 20 degrees of banking in the corners . Franchitti was quoted as saying that the track was " not suitable " for IndyCar racing , while championship rival Will Power – himself a staunch critic of short @-@ track oval racing – described the race as " an accident waiting to happen " . 
 The field of 34 drivers was the biggest in an IndyCar series race in 14 years . A typical oval track race has six to eight fewer drivers , except for the Indianapolis 500 , which normally has a 33 @-@ car field . ESPN.com senior motorsports writer Terry Blount wrote : " Obviously more cars presents more danger . They wanted a whole lot of cars cause obviously this is their season finale and they wanted it to be a big deal . Some of the people that were driving in this event yesterday had no business being in it . Some of them had never driven on a track like this . That was a mistake " . Chris Powell , president of Las Vegas Motor Speedway , defended the race , saying that the circuit had passed all of the IndyCar Series ' accreditation procedures and was deemed suitable for racing . He also went on the record to say that despite the media reporting the concerns of several drivers over the safety of the event , none of those concerns had been raised with him . 
 1979 Formula One World Champion Jody Scheckter , whose son Tomas was involved in the accident , was highly critical of the series organizers , stating that a serious accident was " inevitable " as " they were basically touching wheels at 220 mph ( 350 km / h ) . They all bunch up together so there are thirty @-@ four cars in a small space of track . One person makes a mistake and this happens . You [ shouldn 't ] have to get killed if you make a mistake . It was madness . " Former Formula One and IndyCar driver Mark Blundell agreed , claiming that the Las Vegas circuit was unsuitable for IndyCar racing – this was the last race for the Dallara <unk> – while NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson called for the series to leave oval racing altogether , though he clarified his statement by saying that the open @-@ wheel type cars on a resurfaced 1 @.@ 5 mi ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) track built for the heavier Sprint Cup and Nationwide Series cars was a bad idea . However , former champion Mario Andretti said that the accident was a " freakish " one @-@ off incident and that facilities at the circuit were adequate for racing . While he admitted surprise that more drivers were not seriously injured , he also cautioned against what he called " knee @-@ jerk reactions " to the accident , calling for any changes to the sport to be carefully considered before being introduced , rather than being rushed into action . Former FIA President Max Mosley , a long @-@ time advocate of increased safety in motorsport , agreed with Andretti , urging a " calm and scientific " approach to any proposed changes , particularly when asked about the proposed introduction of closed canopies for open @-@ wheel racing cars . 
 The five million dollar prize was also the subject of criticism in that a driver inexperienced in driving IndyCars would have a higher risk of causing a crash , though Formula One driver Anthony Davidson downplayed the influence of the prize in causing the accident , stating that racing drivers by their nature try to win every race , whether they start from first or last . Many short track races in the United States offer a cash or points bonus where a driver who wins the pole and starts last can collect a cash bonus for winning ; this was used at Lucas Oil Raceway at Indianapolis in the " Night Before F1 " midget car race where the winner of the first feature race started last for the second in a reverse @-@ grid race , and a driver who starts last by winning the first feature , starting last , and winning the second feature wins a cash bonus . Some series offer a point bonus for the driver who makes up the most positions in a race . 
 In the days following the incident , it was learned that two additional drivers had been approached to try for the $ 5 million challenge prize . One was Scott Speed , who previously ran open @-@ wheel Formula One cars for Scuderia Toro Rosso and who had raced on the reconfigured <unk> track in the Craftsman Truck Series for Morgan @-@ Dollar Motorsports in 2008 and for Team Red Bull in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series in 2009 and 2010 . Speed , in an interview he gave to Inside Edition on October 18 , 2011 , said that he declined to take the offer saying that the track conditions were too dangerous for Indy @-@ type cars . Finnish media reported that 2007 Formula One World Champion Kimi Räikkönen , who was splitting time between the World Rally Championship and NASCAR in 2011 , had also been approached to take part in the race , but Räikkönen rejected the offer as he was not confident of having a competitive car , rather than having concerns over safety .

 Three days after the accident , series organizers announced that the race would be the subject of a full investigation . The other members of the Automobile Competition Committee for the United States ( <unk> ) , the national governing body of automobile racing in the United States , and a member of the Fédération Internationale de l 'Automobile ( FIA ) made their resources available for the investigation , which IndyCar officials expected to take several weeks . As all <unk> / FIA members participated in the investigation , IndyCar would have full use of the NASCAR R & D Center in Concord , North Carolina . In the meantime , all testing at Las Vegas Motor Speedway was cancelled indefinitely ; Franchitti and Chip Ganassi Racing had been planning to test the 2012 @-@ spec Dallara chassis at the circuit in the week following the race .

 The results of the investigation into Wheldon 's death were released on December 15 , 2011 . In a report prepared by crash investigators , it was found that Wheldon 's death was caused by an impact with the catch fencing around the circuit . Brian Barnhart further rejected claims that the banking had also contributed to the accident , stating that it created two ideal racing lines , and that these lines made the location of cars more predictable for other drivers ; at the time of the accident , all 34 cars had been behaving as expected . The report also revealed that the right front pull rod of the suspension assembly penetrated Wheldon 's survival cell , though it did not cause him any injury . The report recommended further investigation of this phenomenon , as it was the first recorded incident of its kind in nine years of the use of the <unk> and later <unk> model chassis , which was being retired at the end of the race . The pull @-@ rod suspension chassis is not being utilised in the DW12 .

 = Charles Wilson Cross = 
 Charles Wilson Cross ( November 30 , 1872 – June 2 , 1928 ) was a Canadian politician who served in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta and the Canadian House of Commons . He was also the first Attorney @-@ General of Alberta . Born in Ontario , he studied law at Osgoode Hall Law School before coming west to practice in Edmonton . He became active with the Liberal Party of Canada , and when Alberta was created in 1905 he was chosen by Premier Alexander Cameron Rutherford to be its first Attorney @-@ General . <unk> in the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal , he resigned in 1910 along with the rest of Rutherford 's government . 
 As a backbencher , he became the leader of Liberals opposed to the government of Rutherford 's successor , Arthur Sifton , until Sifton re @-@ appointed him Attorney @-@ General in 1912 . Cross served in this capacity under Sifton and his successor Charles Stewart until 1918 , when Stewart fired him after receiving no response to his request for Cross 's resignation . Cross remained in provincial politics until 1925 , but in a radically diminished role . After leaving provincial politics , he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons , only to be defeated in his 1926 re @-@ election bid . He died in 1928 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Cross was born in Madoc , Ontario to merchant Thomas Cross and his wife , Marie <unk> . He studied at Upper Canada College , the University of Toronto , and Osgoode Hall Law School . He moved west to Edmonton in 1897 , where he opened a law practice with William Short ; it exists today as Duncan Craig LLP . When the idea of creating one or more new provinces out of the Northwest Territories gained currency , Cross was one of three people selected by Edmonton City Council to travel to Ottawa and ensure that Edmonton 's interests were respected . 
 = = Provincial politics = = 
 = = = Early provincial career = = = 
 Cross was a Liberal , and fast established himself was one of the party 's leading Edmonton lights . By some assessments , he was the second most influential Liberal in the city after Frank Oliver , the owner of the Edmonton Bulletin and local Member of Parliament . Once the decision was made to create the province of Alberta , the question emerged of who would govern it : the Northwest Territories were governed on a non @-@ partisan basis by Premier Frederick W. A. G. Haultain , who was a Conservative in federal politics . Some Liberals , such as Peter Talbot , were amenable to Haultain 's becoming the first Premier of Alberta , either as the head of a non @-@ partisan government or one formed by a coalition of Liberals and Conservatives . Cross was not among them . 
 Cross 's view prevailed , and Alberta 's first Lieutenant @-@ Governor , Liberal George Bulyea , invited Alexander Cameron Rutherford to form a government . Haultain went to Saskatchewan , created from a portion of the Northwest Territories at the same time as Alberta was , to lead the Provincial Rights Party . Though Cross was only 32 , Rutherford named him Alberta 's first Attorney @-@ General . In consequence , he was required to contest the 1905 election . He did so in the district of Edmonton , against Conservative William Antrobus Griesbach . Griesbach fought his campaign on the Liberal federal government 's imposition on Alberta of a requirement to fund separate schools , an imposition to which older provinces were not subject . Cross won the election with such a margin that Griesbach lost his deposit . 
 One of the first questions considered by the new Legislative Assembly of Alberta was the choice of provincial capital . The terms of autonomy had made Edmonton the provisional capital , but there was a movement to make Calgary the permanent choice . This movement was led in the legislature by Minister of Public Works William Henry Cushing , Cross 's cabinet colleague , who argued that it would be cheaper to build a legislature building in Calgary than in Edmonton and that Calgary was the economic centre of the province and therefore ought to be capital . Cross countered that Edmonton 's history as capital of the Canadian fur trade and its geographic location close to the centre of the province gave it the stronger claim . Edmonton was eventually selected by a vote of 16 to 8 . It would not be the last issue on which Cross and Cushing disagreed . 
 As Attorney @-@ General , Cross was responsible for overseeing prosecutions . He was especially aggressive in his enforcement of the Sabbath Observance Act , which prohibited most business activities on Sundays . He also introduced new workers ' compensation legislation , the highlight of which was making compensation automatic , rather than the result of a lawsuit by the injured worker . Though the bill addressed some of the labour movement 's concerns , there remained many criticisms : it failed to fine employers responsible for workplace hazards , did not apply to injuries sustained while building or repairing buildings of less than 40 feet ( 12 m ) in height , did not protect casual labourers , and limited compensation to a maximum of C $ 1 @,@ 500 . In response to these concerns , Cross lowered the minimum building height to 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) and raised the maximum compensation to $ 1 @,@ 800 . To assuage farm leaders , he also included an exemption for farm labour . 
 = = = Railway scandal = = = 
 Cross was re @-@ elected in the 1909 election as one of two members elected in the newly expanded Edmonton district . Soon after , in February 1910 , Cushing resigned from cabinet , stating that he disagreed with Rutherford 's approach to railway policy and specifically with his actions regarding the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway ( A & GW ) . The A & GW was one of several new railways to take advantage of the government 's offer , made under considerable public pressure , of loan guarantees . Cushing and John R. Boyle attacked Rutherford 's government , with the latter charging that the Deputy Attorney @-@ General , S. B. Woods , had removed papers from the government 's files on the A & GW . Cross denied these charges on his deputy 's behalf . Boyle followed with a motion that the assets of the A & GW , which he believed was taking advantage of the government 's guarantees to build a sub @-@ standard railway at government expense , be expropriated . Cross led the government 's opposition to the motion . 
 On March 9 , Cross abruptly resigned as Attorney @-@ General ; Woods resigned the next day . Cross gave as his reason that Rutherford had told him that Cushing was re @-@ entering cabinet , and Cross felt that that made his position untenable . Cushing gave a different account : he said that he had been asked by Rutherford to re @-@ enter cabinet , and that the Premier had told him that if he did , Cross would resign . However , he denied ever having agreed to do so , and accused Cross of fabricating his story completely . Rutherford stayed silent until March 11 , when he announced that he had refused Cross 's resignation , and that he was still Attorney @-@ General . Soon after , Boyle made his own set of accusations , saying that agents of the liquor license department , which was under Cross , had been demanding bribes from hoteliers in exchange for licenses and that Cross was aware of this . Cross denied the charge . 
 The crisis divided the Liberal Party into two camps : the pro @-@ government Liberals , led by Cross and Rutherford , and the insurgent Liberals , led by Cushing and Boyle . The insurgents ' objective was to replace Rutherford with Cushing . Though most important Liberals outside the legislature , including Bulyea and Oliver , lacked confidence in Rutherford , they had little more in Cushing . Some newspapers characterized the struggle as the visible element of a battle for influence between Oliver , long Alberta 's most prominent Liberal , and Cross , seen as its rising star . Though Rutherford never actually lost a confidence motion , Bulyea pressured him to resign in favour of Arthur Sifton , the province 's chief justice . Several of Cross 's supporters attempted to extract a promise to keep Cross as Attorney @-@ General in exchange for their support of Sifton 's government , but Sifton was unwilling to agree . Rutherford eventually and reluctantly complied with Bulyea 's wishes , and the rest of his government , including Cross , followed suit . Subsequent rumours suggested that Cross and his followers had agreed to resign only because of a belief that Sifton would be appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada after approximately a year as Premier , with Cross then being asked to form a government . A subsequent commission declined to find Cross guilty of wrongdoing in relation to the A & GW incident , but criticized him and Rutherford for granting over @-@ generous terms to the railway . 
 = = = <unk> and return to cabinet = = = 
 In keeping with Sifton 's policy of excluding all prominent players in the A & GW affair from cabinet , Cross was not re @-@ appointed ( Cushing , Rutherford , and Boyle were also left out ) . Despite this , Cross declared his support for Sifton 's government while restating his admiration for Rutherford 's . In response to the A & GW 's default of its obligations to the government , Sifton introduced a bill confiscating the money the A & GW had raised through the sale of government @-@ guaranteed bonds . Cross , still a supporter of building the A & GW and concerned that the bill did not include a commitment to use the money to do so , opposed it . The bill passed , but was disallowed by the courts . Sifton , left with little choice but to use the money for the purpose for which it had been raised , announced a new policy of railway construction . At the same time , he invited Cross to resume his post as Attorney @-@ General . Boyle was also admitted to cabinet , as Minister of Education ; Cushing and Rutherford , the other major players in the A & GW affair , had withdrawn from the limelight , and neither would return to the legislature after the 1913 election . Cross accepted Sifton 's offer , telling the public that Sifton 's new railway policy " made it proper for me to support and join his government " . 
 In keeping with custom at the time , once appointed to cabinet Cross resigned his seat in the legislature and contested it in a by @-@ election . His by @-@ election was held at the same time as four others , and while Liberal papers were unhesitant about endorsing the Liberal candidates in those , in Edmonton they gave Cross a somewhat <unk> ride . The Calgary Albertan , in an editorial advocating the return of Liberal candidates in all five by @-@ elections , criticized Cross as " disloyal to [ Sifton ] in the beginning , and doubtless will be to the end . " The Edmonton Bulletin , still owned by Oliver , complained that while in the other four by @-@ elections voters were being asked to judge Sifton 's government , in Edmonton it appeared that they were being asked to judge Rutherford 's . Cross defeated his main opponent , Conservative Albert Ewing , but by a much smaller margin than he had managed in 1905 and 1909 . Ewing claimed electoral fraud and appealed the outcome to the courts , but the 1913 election pre @-@ empted his appeal . In that election , perhaps recalling the narrowness of his by @-@ election win , Cross ran in two ridings , Edmonton and Edson . He won both ( Ewing was the second victor from the two @-@ member Edmonton district ) , making him the only person in Alberta history to represent two constituencies at the same time ( though not the only one to try : Sifton also did so in 1913 , and Boyle would in 1921 ) . 
 Prohibition was gaining currency in Alberta : the Conservatives had included it in their 1913 platform , and it was supported by the increasingly powerful United Farmers of Alberta ( UFA ) . The government generally opposed the idea , and Cross held up Manitoba as example of its failures . But the government had also ( at the UFA 's behest ) introduced direct democracy measures , one of which allowed citizens to initiate plebiscites . The well @-@ organized temperance movement did so on prohibition , which was endorsed in the ensuing plebiscite ; the legislature passed the Prohibition Act in the spring of 1916 . As Attorney @-@ General , Cross was responsible for enforcing it . 
 = = = Conscription and the Stewart cabinet = = = 
 In 1917 , the Alberta Liberal Party , held delicately together since 1910 , burst once again into conflict with the conscription crisis . The Conservative federal government of Robert Borden supported imposing conscription to help win World War I , and most of English Canada supported him . The Liberal leader , Wilfrid Laurier , opposed conscription , but many of the party 's English @-@ speaking members supported it and defected to a Borden @-@ led Union government . This dispute had repercussions in the Alberta party : Sifton supported conscription , and shortly after winning the 1917 election ( in which Cross was re @-@ elected in Edson but did not run in Edmonton ) resigned as Premier to move to federal politics and a ministry in Borden 's government . Cross opposed conscription . In this he was joined by Oliver , and the two put aside years of animosity to campaign together for Laurier in the 1917 federal election . Cross regarded Laurier as something of a hero , and proclaimed that he was " fairly convinced that the first duty of Canadians to their country is to get rid of the crowd of profiteers at Ottawa who have brought the country to its present condition . " 
 Sifton 's successor as Premier was Charles Stewart , the Minister of Public Works in his cabinet . Stewart , who supported conscription but did not actively campaign for it or the Unionists , kept Cross as Attorney @-@ General , despite rumours that he would not . Cross 's major challenge was enforcing prohibition , which was proving challenging . The Conservatives , and in particular George Douglas Stanley , were <unk> to accuse Cross of mismanagement . In the meantime , a rift was opening between Cross and Stewart ( whom the Conservatives accused , somewhat ironically , of being unduly influenced by his Attorney @-@ General ) . Stewart found Cross neglectful of his duties , and after Cross refused to dismiss two detectives from his department whose work Stewart felt could be better done by the Alberta Provincial Police , Stewart requested his resignation . When twelve days passed without a reply from Cross , Stewart fired him August 26 , 1918 . His replacement as Attorney @-@ General was Boyle , his nemesis of the Alberta and Great Waterways era . 
 Cross remained in the legislature for several more years , but took no active role in its proceedings , and soon ceased to be regarded as a major force . He was re @-@ elected in the 1921 election , making him and Boyle the only veterans of the first legislature still in office . The UFA , fielding candidates for the first time , won a majority of seats in the election , and Stewart resigned as Premier . Cross continued his indifferent performance as MLA until May 1925 , when he resigned to enter federal politics . 
 = = Federal career and later life = = 
 Cross ran as a Liberal in the 1925 federal election in the riding of Athabaska , and defeated Donald Ferdinand Kellner , the Progressive incumbent from Edmonton East . Stewart , who had also left provincial politics , was elected in the adjacent Edmonton West . The Liberals , under incumbent Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King , won fewer seats than the Conservatives , but King decided to remain as Prime Minister anyway . As a result , Cross sat in the Canadian House of Commons throughout the King @-@ Byng Affair . In the ensuing 1926 election , Cross was soundly defeated in a rematch with Kellner . Charles Wilson Cross died of a heart attack June 2 , 1928 , in Calgary .

 = Mets – Phillies rivalry = 
 The Mets – Phillies rivalry or Battle of the Broads is a Major League Baseball ( MLB ) rivalry between the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies . Both clubs are members of MLB 's National League ( NL ) East division . The rivalry between the two clubs is said to be among the most fiercely contested in the NL . The two NL East divisional rivals have met each other recently in playoff , division , and Wild Card races . 
 Aside from several brawls in the 1980s , the rivalry remained relatively low @-@ key before the 2006 season , as the teams had seldom been equally good at the same time . A notable moment in their early meetings was Jim Bunning 's perfect game on Father 's Day of 1964 , the first perfect game in Phillies history , which happened when the Mets were on a losing streak . The Phillies were near the bottom of the NL East when the Mets won the 1969 World Series and the National League pennant in 1973 , while the Mets did not enjoy success in the late 1970s when the Phillies won three straight division championships . Although both teams each won a World Series in the 1980s , the Mets were not serious contenders in the Phillies ' playoff years ( 1980 , 1981 , and 1983 ) , nor did the Phillies seriously contend in the Mets ' playoff years ( 1986 and 1988 ) . The Mets were the Majors ' worst team when the Phillies won the NL pennant in 1993 , and the Phillies could not post a winning record in either of the Mets ' wild @-@ card @-@ winning seasons of 1999 or 2000 , when the Mets faced the New York Yankees in the 2000 World Series . 
 As the rivalry has intensified in recent years , the teams have battled more often for playoff position . The Mets won the division in 2006 , while the Phillies won five consecutive division titles from 2007 to 2011 . The Phillies ' 2007 championship was won on the last day of the season as the Mets lost a seven @-@ game lead with 17 games remaining . The Phillies broke the Curse of Billy Penn to win the 2008 World Series , while the Mets ' last title came in the 1986 World Series . 
 In 2015 , the Mets won the National League Championship Series for their fifth pennant while the Phillies entered a rebuild phase . The Mets beat the Phillies 14 times and lost 5 for a lopsided season series . The season still provided contentious moments such as , Mets pitcher Matt Harvey drilling Phillies 2nd baseman Chase Utley in retaliation for mets players getting hit by Phillies pitchers , a benches clearing argument between Phillies coach Larry Bowa in regards to a quick pitch by Hansel Robles and a bat flip by Daniel Murphy . Phillies star Chase Utley while , traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers mid @-@ season , injured Mets shortstop Rubén Tejada on a questionable late slide during Game 2 of the National League Division Series . The Mets would go on to win the series and eliminate the Dodgers en @-@ route to the pennant .

 = = = Bunning 's perfect game = = = 
 Bunning 's perfect game occurred in the 1964 season , during which the Phillies finished at the top and the Mets finished bottom . Pitcher Jim Bunning , in his first season with the Phillies , entered play on June 21 with a 6 – 2 record on the season . He was opposed on the mound by Tracy Stallard for the Mets in the first game of a doubleheader . Through the first four innings , Bunning totaled four strikeouts through twelve batters . In the fifth inning , Phillies second baseman Tony Taylor preserved the perfect game with his strong defensive play . A diving catch and a throw from the knees kept Mets catcher Jesse <unk> off of the bases . Bunning also made plays at the plate , hitting a double and driving in two runs in the sixth inning . By the end of the game , even the Mets fans were cheering Bunning 's effort ; he had only reached a three @-@ ball count on two batters , and retired shortstop Charley Smith on a pop @-@ out , and pinch @-@ hitters George Altman and John Stephenson on strikeouts , to complete the perfect game . Bunning , who at the time had seven children , said that his game , pitched on Father 's Day , could not have come at a more appropriate time . He remarked that his slider was his best pitch , " ' just like the no @-@ hitter I pitched for Detroit six years ago ' " . Bunning became the first pitcher to throw a winning no @-@ hitter in both leagues , and posted the first regular @-@ season perfect game since Charlie Robertson in 1922 ( Don Larsen 's prior perfect game was in the 1956 World Series ) . The Phillies also won the second game of the doubleheader , 8 – 2 , behind Rick Wise . 
 The Phillies performed strongly for most of the season , but surrendered a 6 1 ⁄ 2 game lead during the last weeks of the season that year , losing 10 games in a row with 12 games remaining and losing the pennant by one game to the St. Louis Cardinals . " The <unk> " of 1964 is among the most notable collapses in sports history . The Mets , meanwhile , finished the year in last place , with a 53 – 109 record — the worst in Major League Baseball . 
 = = = Tug McGraw = = = 
 Tug McGraw pitched for the Mets from 1965 to 1967 , and again from 1969 to 1974 after spending all of the 1968 season in the minor leagues . In those nine seasons , he amassed 86 saves and appeared in 361 games . He appeared in the postseason for the 1969 Miracle Mets , pitching three innings against the Atlanta Braves . He was selected to the 1972 All @-@ Star team , and appeared in the Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) award voting in 1972 and 1973 . During the 1973 pennant @-@ winning season , he coined the Mets ' rally cry , " Ya gotta believe ! " In the 1974 season , McGraw experienced issues with his arm and shoulder . Thus , the Mets traded McGraw , along with outfielders Don Hahn and Dave Schneck , to the Phillies in December 1974 for pitcher Mac Scarce , catcher John Stearns , and outfielder Del Unser . 
 McGraw became a staple of the back end of the Phillies ' bullpen , saving 94 games between 1975 and 1982 , and earning a place on the 1975 All @-@ Star team . Under manager Danny Ozark , the Phillies won three consecutive division championships from 1976 to 1978 with McGraw as the closer , while the Mets finished third in 1976 and last in 1977 and 1978 . In 1980 , McGraw was on the mound against the Kansas City Royals when the Phillies won their first World Series championship , earning his fourth save of that postseason . He struck out Willie Wilson with the bases loaded to preserve the win for Steve Carlton and the Phillies , leaping from the mound to embrace catcher Bob Boone on the field at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia . Sportswriter Allen Barra recounted that McGraw , in the victory parade after the World Series , told New York fans they could " take this championship and shove it . "

 The Mets won the National League East by 21 1 ⁄ 2 games in 1986 , but the Phillies were the only team to post a winning record against them , including winning 7 of 9 at Veterans Stadium . On September 12 , up by 22 games , the Mets came to Philadelphia for a three game weekend series needing one win to clinch the division . The Mets brought champagne to Philadelphia . Before the series , Mets manager Davey Johnson told the Associated Press , " It will be nice to clinch in Philadelphia . It gives us a chance to beat the only team in our way ... I have a nice warm feeling about this . " He told The Philadelphia Inquirer : " For the fans ... it would be nicer to clinch at home . But for the safety ... and the livelihood of the players ... it 's better to do it on the road . " In the series opener , Mike Schmidt hit a three @-@ run homer , Phillies rookie Bruce Ruffin out pitched the Mets ' Dwight Gooden , and the Phillies won , 6 – 3 . The Phillies won the second game of the series , 6 – 5 ; visiting Mets fans became unruly and damaged seats in the upper deck . One Mets fan was arrested after hitting two Philadelphia police officers . The Phillies completed the sweep by beating the Mets , 6 – 0 , behind a shutout from Kevin Gross , drove in two runs with a fourth @-@ inning triple . The Mets would clinch the division at Shea Stadium on September 17 . After the season , the Phils ' Schmidt won the National League MVP Award , ahead of the Mets ' Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez who finished third and fourth . 
 = = = 1987 – 1988 = = = 
 The Phillies played spoiler in 1987 . The Mets went 13 – 5 against the Phillies in 1987 and outscored Philadelphia 94 – 56 . However , the Phillies won two of three in September to hurt the Mets ' chances of winning the division significantly . 
 The Mets ' Ron Darling took a no @-@ hitter and 4 – 0 lead into the eighth inning against the Phillies on June 28 at the Vet before 52 @,@ 206 fans . Philadelphia 's Greg Gross pinch @-@ hit and tripled to lead off the eighth inning , breaking up the no @-@ hitter . Juan Samuel then singled to break up the shutout , and the Phillies came back with nine hits against Jesse Orosco and Roger McDowell , scoring five runs to win 5 – 4 . It would have been the first no @-@ hitter in Mets history . Compounding the loss for the Mets , the Phillies were in last place at the time , and the loss dropped the Mets 6 1 ⁄ 2 games behind the first @-@ place Cardinals who they would play the next day . Of the win and the Mets , Mike Schmidt said , " The Mets don 't like to give credit when they lose , but they have to do it today . " 
 On September 28 , the Mets came into Philadelphia for a three @-@ game series against the Phillies . The Mets were 2 1 ⁄ 2 games out of first with six games left : three against the Phillies and the last three against the first @-@ place Cardinals . They had an opportunity to win the division and were playing the Phillies , against whom they had a season record of 12 – 3 . The Mets won the opener , 1 – 0 , to move within two games back with five remaining to play . However , the Phillies effectively ended their season on September 29 . As the Cardinals swept a doubleheader from the Montréal Expos , the Phillies ' Don Carman pitched a complete @-@ game one @-@ hitter , facing only 28 batters to shut out the Mets . After the game , Mets manager Davey Johnson said , " How does it feel now ? Empty ? Not yet . But we need to get help . When you play 162 games and you 're eliminated , then you feel empty . And sick . " He promised reporters , " We 're going to win tomorrow night . " . The following night , Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden struck out 10 , and left after pitching nine innings with the score tied at three runs each , but the Phillies ' Luis Aguayo won the game with a 10th @-@ inning pinch @-@ hit home run off of Orosco , clinching at least a tie for first place in the division for the Cardinals . 
 The 1988 Mets returned to the playoffs , but the Phillies , who finished in sixth place in the division with a 65 – 96 record , beat the Mets 8 times in 18 games , the third @-@ best record against them of any team in the league . The Mets won their second division title in three years in a game against the Phillies , and like two years before , did it at home . In the postseason , the Mets lost to the eventual champion Dodgers in the 1988 National League Championship Series . 
 = = = 1989 – 1990 = = = 
 On June 18 , 1989 , after a Mets – Phillies game , the Phillies traded Samuel to the Mets for McDowell and Lenny Dykstra . Dykstra was a career .278 hitter with the Mets and had not equaled his 1986 season when he hit .295 . Dykstra flourished in Philadelphia and went on to be named to three All @-@ Star teams in six full seasons with the Phillies , finish in the top ten in National League Most Valuable Player voting twice , and help lead the Phillies to the 1993 National League pennant . McDowell saved 45 games for the Phillies in parts of three seasons and became a fan favorite . The trade was a bust for the Mets as Samuel hit only .228 for the Mets in 1989 and was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers after the 1989 season . It signaled an ascent of the Phillies which culminated in their 1993 National League pennant and the demise of the Mets in the early 1990s . Sports Illustrated writer and Mets fan David Vecsey counts the Dykstra trade as one of the five worst in Mets history , writing , " Never mind that Dykstra was better than Samuel , this trade was devastating to Mets fans on a purely personal level . With one phone call , GM Joe McIlvaine gutted the team of its heart . " The trade also ushered in a period of bad blood between the two teams . 
 On September 27 , 1989 , the Phillies faced the Mets in their home finale at Shea Stadium in New York after a disappointing Mets season . The Mets had won the East in 1988 but were in third place on September 26 behind the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals . McDowell was closing out a 5 – 3 win for the Phillies when , with two outs in the ninth , he induced former teammate Gregg Jeffries to ground out to second to end the game . As Jeffries was running out the play , McDowell said something to him prompting Jeffries to charge the mound and wrestle McDowell to the ground . The benches cleared and punches were exchanged before the umpires could separate the teams . Jeffries later claimed that McDowell had thrown at him during a 2 – 1 Phillies victory on September 25 . 
 The brawling continued in 1990 . During an August 9 game at Shea , Gooden hit Phillies hitters Dickie Thon and Tommy Herr . When Gooden came to bat in the fifth inning , Phillies pitcher Pat Combs hit Gooden in the knee with a fastball . Phillies outfielder Von Hayes defended Combs after the game , " Gooden better expect retaliation if he keeps hitting guys with 95 mph ( 153 km / h ) fastballs . We 've got to protect our players . " Gooden charged the mound and tackled Combs . Phillies catcher Darren Daulton followed Gooden and landed a series of punches on the back of Gooden 's head . Darryl Strawberry had been in the Mets clubhouse and rushed the field after Daulton but was himself blindsided by Hayes . Of Daulton , Gooden later said , " Daulton was the guy we wanted most . He 's a cheap @-@ shot artist . We learned that about him last year " , referring to the September 1989 fight . Six players and Phillies coach Mike Ryan were ejected from the game . Eight players were later fined , including the Mets ' Tim Teufel , who said , " It was money well spent . Sometimes you just have to defend yourself and your teammates . " 
 = = = 1991 – 1994 = = = 
 The tone of baseball rivalries changed in the early 1990s ; fraternization between players who had moved to different teams or knew each other from various ventures kept baseball rivalries to a " friendly " level . However , Major League Baseball 's 1994 divisional re @-@ alignment solidified the rivalry between the Phillies and Mets . The Pittsburgh Pirates , former members of the National League East and in @-@ state rivals of the Phillies , moved into the newly created National League Central Division , and the Atlanta Braves , former members of the National League West , entered the division . Prior to the switch , the East Division contained seven teams , spread out over a wider geographical area , including the St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs , as well as the expansion Florida Marlins . Members of all 28 teams , including the Phillies and Mets , drew together during the 1994 labor stoppage , but players from both teams were on opposite sides of the argument even then . Dykstra claimed that he was losing $ 30 @,@ 000 ( $ 46 @,@ 589 in current dollars ) per day for every day he did not work during the strike . While other players chastised Dykstra for his comments , Mets pitcher and player representative John Franco intimated that if someone crossed the picket line , as Dykstra suggested , " ' once we get back in I 'll be the first to kick his [ butt ] [ sic ] ' " .

 The division @-@ rival Braves defeated the Cleveland Indians in the 1995 World Series ; on the way to doing so , they left the rest of the division behind them . The Mets and Phillies finished in second and third places in the division , respectively , with identical 69 – 75 records ; the Braves were the only National League East team to finish above .500 . The Mets and Phillies staged a close battle for second place , with New York coming out ahead , taking 7 victories from the 13 @-@ game season series . Both the Mets and Phillies finished near the bottom of the division in 1996 : the Mets ended the season in fourth place , with a 71 – 91 record , while the Phillies finished last ( 67 – 95 ) . The Mets took a second consecutive close season series from the Phillies , with an identical 7 – 6 record to the prior year . The 1997 Mets improved to 88 – 74 , but that record was only good for third place in the division , as the Braves finished with 101 wins and the Marlins , with a record of 92 – 70 , took the National League wild card and won the 1997 World Series . The Phillies , meanwhile , languished in last place behind the Expos , with a 68 – 94 record , and only managed to take 5 of 12 games from the Mets that season , including a September 9 game at Shea Stadium that was a moment of peace in the rivalry to remember former Phillies player and broadcaster and original Met Richie Ashburn , who died that morning . 
 The 1998 Mets finished in second place , with the Phillies right behind them in third . The Braves finished with the best record in the National League ( 106 wins ) , but were unable to make it to the World Series . The Mets finished over .500 for the second straight year , aided by their 8 – 4 record against the Phillies . The standings were identical the next season , as the Mets faced the Braves in the 1999 National League Championship Series ; they were defeated , and the Braves lost to the New York Yankees in the ensuing World Series . The Phillies and Mets split the season series , six games each ; the Phillies finished under .500 for the sixth consecutive season with a 77 – 85 record . The Mets won the wild card again in 2000 , finishing one game behind the Braves in the division and defeating the Cardinals in the League Championship Series to face the Yankees in the 2000 World Series . Though the Phillies finished in last place in the division with a 65 – 97 record , they defeated the Mets in the season series , 7 – 6 .

 Major League Baseball changed its scheduling format in 2001 , further intensifying division matchups throughout the league . The new " unbalanced schedule " allowed for additional games each season between divisional rivals , replacing additional series with teams outside the division . Due to the change , the Phillies and Mets now played each other 17 or more times each season ( 19 times in 2001 ) . Early on , the unbalanced schedule favored the Mets , who had a winning percentage of <unk> ( 27 – 23 ) against the division in the 2000 season , while the Phillies managed a <unk> mark ( 23 – 28 ) ; the trend held true in 2001 , when the Mets won the season series over the Phillies , 11 – 8 . The scheduling drew criticism both when it was enacted and after the fact , with some analysts even positing that the unbalanced schedule hurt intra @-@ divisional play . This , however , did not affect the Phillies and Mets , as they drew an average of 27 @,@ 926 fans to their games in 2001 . Attendance for the rivalry games increased in 2002 , to 29 @,@ 403 fans per game , as the Phillies bested the Mets in the season series , 10 – 9 , and was strong in 2003 , when they drew nearly 28 @,@ 000 fans per game and the Phillies took their second consecutive season series , 12 – 7 .

 The signing of former Phillies closer Billy Wagner by the Mets between the 2005 and 2006 seasons was a factor in the intensification of the rivalry . Pat Burrell and Wagner became embroiled in heated media discussions after Wagner departed the Phillies . For the first time in 2006 , both franchises fielded contenders until deep into the season . The Mets steadily led the NL East ( finally supplanting the decade @-@ long division champions , the Atlanta Braves ) , while the Phillies maintained pace as a wild card contender until the very end of the season . The Mets won the head @-@ to @-@ head season matchup , beating the Phillies 11 out of 18 times . The Mets won the division , but lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2006 National League Championship Series .

 On January 23 , 2007 , Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins made a statement that may have set the rivalry in a dead heat : " I think we are the team to beat in the NL East … but that 's only on paper . " Many Mets fans and players laughed at the prediction , especially once the Phillies stumbled out of the gate in April , starting the season at 1 – 6 and posting an 11 – 14 record for the month . The Mets , meanwhile , sat firmly in the NL East lead for almost all of the season . 
 As the season wore on , Philadelphia developed momentum as a wild @-@ card contender . The Phillies dominated the Mets in head @-@ to @-@ head play , posting three separate series sweeps , including a pivotal sweep of a four @-@ game series at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia during late August which included two walk @-@ off hits by Chase Utley and Ryan Howard and comeback victories for the Phillies in three of the four games . During the season , Burrell also hit two home runs off Wagner , resulting in two blown saves . By the time Philadelphia swept the Mets at Shea Stadium in mid @-@ September , the Phillies were threatening to move from wild @-@ card contender to division leader . With 17 games left to play , the Mets led the Phillies by seven games ; during that final stretch , the Mets won only five games and lost twelve , while the Phillies went 13 – 4 . On the final day of the season , the Phillies won the division , backing up Rollins ' quote . Mets starter Tom Glavine gave up seven runs in the first inning to the Florida Marlins , while the Phillies beat the Washington Nationals behind Philadelphian Jamie Moyer to win the division . Rollins capped his prediction by adding his first career Most Valuable Player award . According to Baseball Prospectus , the Mets ' collapse over the end of the season ranked statistically as the second @-@ worst in baseball history . After the 2007 season , Wagner also said that " [ the ] collapse didn 't come because the Phillies beat us , the collapse came because we played bad " .

 On February 16 , 2008 , Mets center fielder Carlos Beltrán made a statement regarding the upcoming season . He stated that " [ without ] Santana , we felt , as a team , that we had a chance to win in our division . With him now , I have no doubt that we 're going to win in our division . I have no doubt in that . We 've got what it takes . To Jimmy Rollins : We are the team to beat . " Inasmuch as Beltran had imitated Rollins ' 2007 preseason prediction , Rollins arrived in camp for Spring training and responded : 
 " There isn 't a team in the National League that 's better than us . The pressure 's back on them if you ask me . They were on paper the best team in the division last year and they were supposed to win , and they didn ’ t . One , there are four other teams in our division who are going to make sure that doesn 't happen , and two , has anyone ever heard of plagiarism ? That was pretty good , especially coming from him . He 's a quiet guy , so it was probably shocking when he said it . Not shocking in a bad way , like ' Wow , I can 't believe he said that . ' More like , ' Wow , he finally said something because he 's a leader on that team and you definitely need to be a vocal leader . " 
 Throughout most of the season , the Phillies and Mets battled each other for the NL East lead , along with the Florida Marlins . Going into the final season series between the two teams , former Phillie and special hitting instructor Mike Schmidt fanned the flames of the rivalry with an e @-@ mail to manager Charlie Manuel , later posted for the entire team in the clubhouse . 
 " One pitch , one at bat , one play , one situation , think ‘ small ’ and ‘ big ’ things result , tough at @-@ bats , lots of walks , stay up the middle with men on base , whatever it takes to ‘ keep the line moving ’ on offense , 27 outs on defense , the Mets know you ’ re better than they are … They remember last year . You guys are never out of a game . Welcome the challenge that confronts you this weekend . You are the stars . Good luck . # 20 . " 
 Mets players reacted quickly ; David Wright replied , " To each his own . He 's obviously biased in his e @-@ mails or letters . I see a starting pitcher that goes out there and throws like Brett Myers – that works much better than a rally cry from a former player . " This response came a day after Myers defeated the Mets 3 – 0 , throwing eight shutout innings and striking out ten . The Mets won the season series 11 – 7 . 
 After the final season series , the Mets held onto first place until September 16 , when a September surge moved the Phillies into first place . On September 19 , however , the Phillies lost to the Florida Marlins while the Mets beat the Atlanta Braves to put New York back into the division lead . The results were reversed the following night , and the Phillies regained the top spot , where they would ultimately finish . The Phillies won the National League East on September 27 , while the Mets were eliminated from postseason contention the next day with a 4 – 2 loss to the Florida Marlins in the final game at Shea Stadium . The Milwaukee Brewers defeated the Chicago Cubs that day to clinch the National League wild card . This marked the second year in a row the Mets were eliminated from the playoffs on the last regular @-@ season game . It also marked the first time in baseball history that a team had lost the last game of the season to miss the playoffs after holding a three @-@ game lead in two consecutive seasons . After victories over the Brewers and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the postseason , the Phillies went on to win the World Series over the Tampa Bay Rays .

 During the team 's post @-@ parade celebration on October 31 at Citizens Bank Park , Jimmy Rollins took verbal shots at the Mets organization . " A lot of things were made in the offseason " , Rollins said . " We can talk about the New York Mets . They brought in that great pitcher , Johan Santana , but they forgot that it takes more than one player to bring home a championship . " 
 Nearing the end of 2008 and the thick of the offseason , World Series MVP Cole Hamels was asked by WFAN radio hosts whether he considered the Mets " choke artists " . Hamels replied , " For the past two years they 've been choke artists . " He explained that he considered Mets shortstop José Reyes a <unk> for his post @-@ home run displays and that the Phillies had mocked their center fielder Shane Victorino for similar antics during the National League Division Series . 
 On December 13 , newly signed Mets closer Francisco Rodríguez added his sentiments to the fray . " Of course we 're going to be the frontrunner . Of course we 're going to be the team to beat " , Rodriguez told reporters . " I don 't want there to be a controversy . I don 't want the other team to take it personally , or take it in a bad way . But I 'm a really competitive guy . I like to win . If they ask me , ' Oh , which ballclub is going to win the National League East ? ' It 's going to be the Mets . Easy question . " 
 = = = 2009 – 2010 = = = 
 Throughout the first few months of the 2009 season the Mets and Phillies looked as though they would make this year into another close playoff race . By the end of May the Mets had won three out of the four games they played against each other ; however , the Phillies retained a half game lead . Both clubs struggled in June as the Phillies slumped and the New York became plagued with injuries . By the end of June the Phillies had increased their division lead , but only to two and a half games . 
 This closeness would not continue , however , as the Phillies went on to finish with a 93 – 69 record , winning the division and securing the second seed in the playoffs . The Mets , on the other hand , went 33 – 53 from July through September and finished fourth in the NL East , 23 games behind . The Phillies would go on to win the National League Pennant for the second year in a row , but would lose the World Series in six @-@ games to the Mets ' cross @-@ town rivals , the New York Yankees . 
 One notable occurrence during the 2009 season was the Phillies adding former Mets pitcher Pedro Martínez . Martinez posted a 3 @.@ 63 ERA with a 5 – 1 record . In his one start against the Mets , he threw six innings and gave up four earned runs . 
 In 2010 , after leading the division standing by the end of April , the Mets again began to struggle . The Mets would not hold first place at any point after May 1 , although they came close in mid @-@ June . By the end of the season the Mets had finished 18 games behind the first place Phillies . For its part , Philadelphia was mainly engaged in a fierce division race with the Atlanta Braves , trailing them as late in the season as September 6 . However , Philadelphia would surge at the end of the month and once again be crowned division champs . 2010 ultimately served as a disappointment for the Mets – Phillies rivalry . 
 = = = 2011 – 2014 = = = 
 In 2011 , the Phillies won the season series against the Mets , winning 11 of 18 games . The Phillies set a record for wins in a season with 102 , surpassing the previous record of 101 , set back @-@ to @-@ back in 1976 and 1977 , while the Mets finished 25 games out of first place at 77 – 85 , in fourth place and missed the playoffs for the fifth straight year . 
 The game on May 1 in Philadelphia became a moment of peace in the rivalry during the top of the ninth inning . Mets ' Daniel Murphy was batting as a pinch @-@ hitter against Phillies ' reliever Ryan Madson when the fans started chanting " U @-@ S @-@ A ! " The Phillies didn 't know the reason for the chants , but in the Mets ' dugout , bench coach Ken <unk> told Manager Terry Collins that al @-@ Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden , the mastermind of the September 11 attacks , had been killed by United States special operations forces in Abbottabad , Pakistan . Shane Victorino later told the Phillies the news . However , when asked how they learned about it during an on @-@ air telephone call with Mike and Mike in the Morning on ESPN Radio the next day , he said that a trainer in the dugout broke the news . Ryan Howard called the news " an uplifting moment , " while Victorino said it was " a special moment ... for families ... who ... lost their loved ones ... ( on ) 9 / 11 " and " a big day in American history . " On the Mets ' side , David Wright called it " just an incredible moment and ... you kind of come together ... for a common cause " , while Collins said that the Mets 2 – 1 , 14 @-@ inning win behind Ronny Paulino 's game @-@ winning RBI double in his Mets debut was " a good win for us , and obviously a huge win for America tonight " , but felt they " could have finished the game two hours ago and celebrated a little bit of it . " Mike <unk> of USA Today called the game between the rivals " a perfect fit " when the news broke , while Adam Rubin of <unk> called the peace in the rivalry " fitting " for a Mets fan , and said that it drew parallels to their 3 – 2 win over rival Atlanta Braves on September 21 , 2001 in the first major sporting event in New York City since the attacks . 
 On September 26 , 2011 , the day after the teams ' final meeting of the season , the National Hockey League formally announced that the rivalry would be played out at Citizens Bank Park during the offseason at the 2012 NHL Winter Classic on January 2 , saying it would be a showdown between the teams ' hockey counterparts , the New York Rangers and the Philadelphia Flyers . Shane Victorino attended the game , which the Rangers came from behind to win , 3 – 2 , which MLB.com said that " just like the Mets – Phillies rivalry , being able to come back and steal a game on the road was quite sweet , " and said of the rivalry being played out : " What better rivalry than this ? Both these teams , they 're in first place ( in the Atlantic Division ) . I 'm excited to see it . " 
 During the 2012 season , the Mets beat the Phillies ten times , including a sweep of a three @-@ game series at Citizens Bank Park in early May in which they came from behind to win each game in the late innings . In 2013 , the Mets clubhouse store in New York City started selling shirts saying , " My Ex @-@ Wife is a Philles fan " , while MLB Network aired a MasterCard / <unk> commercial featuring <unk> <unk> and Mr. Met . 
 In 2014 , the Mets and the Phillies met in a rare 5 game regular season series at Citizens Bank Park . The Mets took 4 out of 5 games . Three straight games were decided in extras , with the Phillies walking off 6 @-@ 5 in 14 in Game 2 and the Mets winning 5 @-@ 4 in 14 and 4 @-@ 3 in 11 in Games 3 and 4 respectively . 
 = = = 2015 : Phillies rebuild , Mets win Pennant = = = 
 In 2015 , the Phillies entered a rebuilding phase , trading away former stars Cole Hamels and Chase Utley mid @-@ season . The Phillies would go on to a last place finish in the National League East , losing 99 games on the season , while the Mets would go on and win the National League East title . 
 While the rivalry was somewhat subdued by the <unk> of the two teams records , the rivalry did provide some moments . On April 15 , Mets pitcher Matt Harvey drilled Chase Utley in the back , after a few Mets pitchers had been hit by the Phillies . On August 25 , during a game at Citizens Bank Park Phillies coach Larry Bowa started yelling out of the dugout after a quick pitch by Mets reliever Hansel Robles while Darin Ruf was in the box not looking up and not ready for the pitch . Bowa also yelled at Mets 1st baseman Daniel Murphy over a perceived slight by Murphy 's bat flip earlier in the game during a home run . Benches cleared as Bowa threatened Murphy with retaliation and was ultimately ejected from the game . 
 The Mets played in the 2015 National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers whose roster featured former Phillies players Jimmy Rollins and Chase Utley . The series featured a contentious slide in Game 2 by Utley at 2nd base , injuring Mets shortstop Rubén Tejada . The fallout created controversy on take out slides at 2nd and Utley was suspended for two games . Mets fans booed Utley loudly during the pregame for Game 3 at Citi Field , and chanted " We want Utley " after the mets took a 10 @-@ 3 lead during the game . However Utley did not appear again in the series until late in Game 5 and the Mets won the series , and eventually won the 2015 National League Championship Series for the pennant .

 = = = Kansas Jayhawks = = = 
 Dick Harp was in the midst of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game . Kansas came into the season favored to win the national title . This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per NCAA rules . At the beginning of the season , the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun , Maurice King , John Parker , Lew Johnson , and Sophomore Chamberlain . Ron Loneski replaced Johnson 's spot in the starting line up during the season . Harp began the season with a man to man defense , but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball . 
 The Kansas Jayhawks began the regular season with twelve consecutive victories before losing to Iowa State by two points after losing the lead in the closing seconds of the game . Kansas ' following game was against Iowa State ; this time , the Jayhawks won the game by a margin of nine points .

Due to the lack of a shot @-@ clock in 1957 , the Cowboys held the ball for the final three and a half minutes in order to win the game 56 – 54 . Both of the Jayhawks regular season losses were in part due to poor ball control by the Jayhawks . The Jayhawks squad closed out the regular season with four more victories .

 The national semifinal between Kansas and San Francisco was not televised , while the North Carolina – Michigan State match – up was televised in some areas .

By the time that the match – up was set between the two teams , an eleven station network had been arranged . Castleman D. Chesley , a local television producer , broadcast the game in North Carolina on five stations . After the Tar Heels won the Eastern Regional , Chesley managed to get announcers , sponsors , and five stations to set up a network to broadcast North Carolina 's Final Four games from Kansas City .

 = = = First half = = = 
 The game began with a tip – off between Kansas ' seven foot tall Wilt Chamberlain and North Carolina 's Tommy Kearns , who was not even six feet tall . Coach Frank McGuire sent out Kearns after he had been talking down Chamberlain the night before . The rest of the North Carolina squad set up in their zone defense rather than around the center circle per McGuire 's request to " show them the zone we were going to use . " The Jayhawks were unable to score on their opening possession and set up in their defense as the Tar Heels came down the court with the ball . Kansas ' initial defense was a box – and – one , which consisted of four players in a box around a basket while one player , Maurice King , played defense on North Carolina 's Lennie Rosenbluth . Kearns received a pass along the baseline and was fouled in the act of shooting . Kearns missed the shot , but made both free throws to give Carolina the early 2 – 0 lead . Kansas missed a jump shot , and North Carolina 's Joe Quigg converted a 12 @-@ foot baseline shot . Kansas scored their first points off of two free throws . 
 The Tar Heels ' began to strain Kansas ' defense with several players making perimeter shots , and when combined with Kansas ' inability to convert from the field , this allowed the Tar Heels to jump out to a 11 – 4 lead . This led to Harp changing Kansas ' defensive formation to a 2 – 3 zone , with Chamberlain under the basket . Rosenbluth — who was now relatively unguarded when compared to Kansas ' previous formation — made a contested seventeen foot jumper . Kansas retaliated by giving the ball to Chamberlain who was subsequently fouled as he went up for a shot . He went to the free throw line and made one of two . As Kansas went up the floor coach Harp ordered his squad to revert to their original box – and – one . Carolina 's Kearns made a jumper from the floor after pump faking to lose a defender , which brought the score to 15 – 7 in favor of Carolina . Kansas came up the floor and missed their shot , but Chamberlain grabbed the rebound and was then fouled in air . He went to the line for a one – and – one and missed the first shot , while Rosenbluth caught the rebound . 
 During the following possession , Harp changed Jayhawks ' defense to a man – to – man . The change in defense caused the Tar Heels to become more active on offense with several screens and movement on offense . The possession resulted in an off the ball foul that sent Rosenbluth to the free throw line where he made both shots . Kansas pushed the ball up the court quickly with King , who took an eight @-@ foot shot and Carolina collected the rebound and continued to slow the tempo in the half court as Kansas shifted back into a 2 – 3 zone . The Tar Heels passed the ball back and forth until the Jayhawks broke from their zone and went into a man – to – man again . Kearns made a close quarters shot in the paint . Kansas stepped up their defense at the behest of coach Harp and held Carolina scoreless for two minutes . During the period , Kansas made four free throws to cut their deficit to two points , with the score being 19 – 17 . The Tar Heels continued to slow the pace and work the ball around to get the open shot , while the Jayhawks would rush up the court and attempt to give the ball to Chamberlain before taking a poor shot . This resulted in moderate success for both teams as North Carolina scored eight points to Kansas ' three before the final two minutes began . In the closing two minutes , the two teams would both score two free throws to bring the score to 29 – 22 in favor of North Carolina . 
 = = = Second half = = = 
 The second half began with another jump ball between the two competing teams . Chamberlain won the tip as Carolina sent out Quigg to contest the jump rather than Kearns like in the first tip – off . Both teams failed to score on their first possession , but after Carolina missed their opening shot , Kansas scored on a fast @-@ break pull @-@ up shot . Kansas scored once more – from a lob to Chamberlain – before the Tar Heels were able to score with a baseline jump shot from Quigg to bring the score 31 – 26 . Kansas closed the lead to 31 @-@ 30 with a basket and a pair of free throws from Chamberlain . Carolina 's Kearns returned with an acrobatic layup to extend the lead to three points . 
 After Kansas failed to convert a shot on their next possession , North Carolina proceeded to pass the ball around the perimeter of the court for close to two minutes . After finding the right setup , Lennie Rosenbluth drove to the basket and scored . Following that possession , Kansas began to make outside jump shots . When combined with Carolina 's inability to score , Kansas ' improved jump shots led to a 10 – 2 Kansas run , with Kansas taking the lead nine minutes into the second half . In addition , as North Carolina players continued to foul Chamberlain in order to make him score from the free throw line , they began to get into foul trouble . Kansas ' coach Dick Harp then began to hold the ball beginning with their next possession . Harp 's plan worked for a while as Carolina was not able to overcome Kansas ' three point lead ; Kansas did not attempt a shot for over five minutes . 
 With 1 : 45 remaining in the game , Kansas ' Gene Elstun was fouled by Lennie Rosenbluth on a lay – up attempt . This was Rosenbluth 's fifth foul , which disqualified him for the rest of the game . Elstun missed the two free throws from the foul and Carolina got the rebound . The Jayhawks were only able to score two points after Rosenbluth 's disqualification . North Carolina then began to rally after scoring a basket and then an accompanying free throw . Bob Young — who had replaced Rosenbluth after his fifth foul – scored a lay – up to bring Carolina within two points . Carolina tied the game at 46 – 46 after Tommy Kearns made a free throw in the closing seconds . The Tar Heels got the ball back and held it for one final possession . The ball was passed to Bob Cunningham who missed his initial shot , but was able to get the rebound . Cunningham went up for another shot , but received heavy contact from Chamberlain . No foul was called and the time ran out , sending the game to overtime .

The Tar Heels traversed the court and Bob Young managed to score a basket to give Carolina the edge . However , North Carolina was unable to stop Kansas during the ensuing drive as Chamberlain scored a basket to bring the score to 48 – 48 . After Kansas score the tying basket , North Carolina proceeded to hold the ball for one final shot before time ran out . Carolina 's Kearns drove and put up a shot that was blocked by Chamberlain as time ran out .

North Carolina 's Brennan boxed out Chamberlain who went over Brennan to collect the rebound and was called for over the back . Joe Quigg turned the ball over after traveling , while Chamberlain threw the ball out of bounds on the subsequent possession . Carolina failed to capitalize on Chamberlain 's error when Kearns missed the front end of a one – and – one . Kansas came down the court and passed the ball to Chamberlain who was then fouled hard by Cunningham . This sparked an altercation between the two teams , which resulted in Chamberlain being hit in the stomach with a megaphone and his knee being scarred by a Carolina cheerleader . The referees stopped the commotion and Chamberlain was sent to the line , where he missed his shots , and Carolina got the rebound . The Tar Heels aimed to hold the ball for a final shot but they turned the ball over to Kansas with ten seconds to go and the Jayhawks called a timeout with six seconds left .

 The next possession , Kansas ' John Parker stole the ball and crossed half court when coach Harp called a timeout . Chamberlain received the ball in the post , went up for a shot and received some contact ; however , no referee called a foul and the ball rolled out of bounds off Carolina . The next play , Elstun was run into by a Tar Heel and went to the line for two shots with 31 seconds remaining , where he missed the first and made the second shot . Out of timeouts , Kearns drove into the lane and put up a shot that was blocked out of bounds by Chamberlain .

Kansas called a timeout and in @-@ bounded to Loneski who then passed the ball towards Chamberlain who was under the basket .

 Despite losing in the championship game , Kansas ' Wilt Chamberlain was named the NCAA Tournament 's Most Outstanding Player . Chamberlain was also named to the Consensus All @-@ Americans squad for the 1956 – 57 season . North Carolina 's Lennie Rosenbluth was named the Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year for his performance throughout the basketball season , as well as a Consensus All – American . The Tar Heels ' coach Frank McGuire was named UPI College Basketball Coach of the Year for leading North Carolina to a win in the National Championship game and a perfect record of 32 – 0 . 
 While coach McGuire and Rosenbluth boarded a plane to New York to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show , the rest of the Tar Heels returned to North Carolina two days later when they landed at Raleigh – Durham International Airport ( <unk> ) . The North Carolina squad was greeted by over 10 @,@ 000 fans . Some players were carried by members of the crowd from the airport ramp to the terminal . The airport manager believed the crowd gathered to meet the Tar Heels was the biggest in <unk> 's history . The crowd was so big that it prevented Chancellor Robert House from giving a planned speech for the team . The large crowd at the airport was credited to the airing of both the national semifinal and National Championship game on television around North Carolina . The 1957 North Carolina team were awarded watches for their victory in the national championship . In the 1990s , the team was given rings to commemorate their win in the national championship game after then North Carolina coach Dean Smith insisted upon giving the team rings . Coach McGuire was given a brand new Carolina blue and white Cadillac by the university , as well as being signed to a new five – year contract that gave him $ 11 @,@ 500 per year . 
 After seeing the success from televising the final games of the tournament , Castleman Chesley believed that " ACC basketball could be as popular as any TV show in North Carolina . " Chesley 's success in airing North Carolina 's national semifinal and National Championship games in North Carolina led to the increase in attention towards basketball around the state . In addition , it led to Chesley and the Atlantic Coast Conference agreeing to a television contract that would air twelve ACC games league – wide during the 1957 – 58 season . The games aired the following season were called the ACC Game of the Week which aired on Saturdays . The television contract allowed the league to expand and increase the conference 's visibility . It also led to an increase in ticket sales for the members of the ACC . Due to the increase in televising of ACC games , more children began to pick up the sport of basketball . 
 In Chapel Hill , North Carolina , the Tar Heel fans that watched the game on the television flooded Franklin Street after the victory over the Jayhawks . Over two thousand people rushed the street , which prevented cars from passing for over an hour . Police were required to help maintain the crowds . This has since turned into a tradition where people overrun Franklin Street following a win over the Duke Blue Devils or whenever the Tar Heels have won a National Championship . 
 Wilt Chamberlain received criticism for his inability to win lead Kansas to a win in the National Championship game ; Chamberlain later admitted that this loss was the most painful in his life . He returned to Kansas for his junior year and to play another season under coach Dick Harp . Chamberlain quickly became frustrated with the opposing teams ' way of playing him , which primarily consisted of double or triple teaming Chamberlain in order to limit his offensive production and effectiveness . In addition , many teams resorted to running out the time on the clock when in the lead against the Jayhawks to increase their odds of winning the game . After the Jayhawks failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament that year , Chamberlain decided to forgo his senior season to play with the Harlem Globetrotters . He did not return to Kansas ' campus for over 40 years after leaving for the Globetrotters ; he finally returned in 1998 when his jersey was retired . 
 = Accounting research = 
 Accounting research is research on the effects of economic events on the process of accounting , and the effects of reported information on economic events . It encompasses a broad range of research areas including financial accounting , management accounting , auditing and taxation . 
 Academic accounting research " addresses all aspects of the accounting profession " using the scientific method , while research by practicing accountants focuses on solving problems for a client or group of clients . Academic accounting research can make significant contribution to accounting practice , although changes in accounting education and the accounting academia in recent decades has led to a divide between academia and practice in accounting . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Accounting research is carried out both by academic researchers and by practicing accountants . Academic accounting research addresses all areas of the accounting profession , and examines issues using the scientific method ; it uses evidence from a variety of sources including financial information , experiments , and computer simulations . 
 Research by practicing accountants " focuses on solving immediate problems for a single client or small group of clients " and involve , for example , decision @-@ making on the implementation of new accounting or auditing standards , the presentation of unusual transactions in the financial statements , and the impact of new tax laws on clients . 
 Accounting research is also carried out by accounting organizations such as standard @-@ setting bodies . For example , the International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB ) may initiate research projects for certain issues , the results of these may inform its decision whether to move the issues to its active agenda . 
 = = = History of accounting research = = = 
 Accounting research has undergone significant changes in the past decades . In the 1950s , an accounting academia was established that adopted the requirements of social science academia , such as PhD qualifications and research papers , and the mid @-@ 1970s saw a shift from the dominance of normative research to positive research " that uses methods from finance , economics , and other established academic disciplines " . 
 = = Academic research and accounting practice = = 
 = = = Contribution of academic research to practice = = = 
 The contribution of academic accounting research to accounting practice includes the assessment of current accounting practices , the development of new practices , and the development of university curricula : 
 " Academic research has an important role to play , both in assessing the extent to which existing practices are ‘ fit for purpose ’ and in developing new practices to address changing business , economic and societal needs . Research also informs the teaching curricula in universities , thus affecting the range of issues of which future generations will become aware and consider important . " 
 For example , academic accounting research " can improve the understanding of how stakeholders actually use the information accountants provide " , and prior academic studies have contributed to fraud risk assessment , the future direction of the profession , and the impact of changing accounting standards . 
 = = = Gap between academia and practice = = = 
 Several publications , including the recent accounting literature , have suggested a divide or gap between the academic and professional communities in accounting . Aspects of the divide have been suggested to include criticisms of academics for speaking with their own jargon and aiming to publish research rather than improve practice , and criticisms of practicing accountants for being resistant to changes to the status quo and reluctant to disclose data . 
 The divide between accounting academia and practice was originally centered on whether a broader education or just technical training was the best way to educate accountants . From the 1950s , accounting academia and practice grew further divided due to the accounting academic community adopting requirements from social science academia , while practicing accountants " maintained an emphasis on professional qualifications and technical skills " . 
 Aside from accounting academia and practice valuing different skills and requirements , a variety of factors have been proposed for the divide . One view is that a lack of training in reading academic research may lead practicing accountants " to dismiss what could be very helpful information as either too complicated or too disconnected to be useful " ; while another view points to fundamental failures in academic research in business and economics in general — for example that researchers have failed to effectively question prevailing economic and business models .
