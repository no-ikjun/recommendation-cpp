 = Proteasome = 
 <unk> are protein complexes inside all eukaryotes and archaea , and in some bacteria . The main function of the proteasome is to degrade unneeded or damaged proteins by proteolysis , a chemical reaction that breaks peptide bonds . 
 In eukaryotes , proteasomes are located in the nucleus and the cytoplasm . The main function of the proteasome is to degrade unneeded or damaged proteins by proteolysis , a chemical reaction that breaks peptide bonds . Enzymes that help such reactions are called proteases . <unk> are part of a major mechanism by which cells regulate the concentration of particular proteins and degrade misfolded proteins . The degradation process yields peptides of about seven to eight amino acids long , which can then be further degraded into shorter amino acid sequences and used in synthesizing new proteins . Proteins are tagged for degradation with a small protein called ubiquitin . The tagging reaction is catalyzed by enzymes called ubiquitin ligases . Once a protein is tagged with a single ubiquitin molecule , this is a signal to other ligases to attach additional ubiquitin molecules . The result is a polyubiquitin chain that is bound by the proteasome , allowing it to degrade the tagged protein . 
 In structure , the proteasome is a cylindrical complex containing a " core " of four stacked rings forming a central pore . Each ring is composed of seven individual proteins . The inner two rings are made of seven β subunits that contain three to seven protease active sites . These sites are located on the interior surface of the rings , so that the target protein must enter the central pore before it is degraded . The outer two rings each contain seven α subunits whose function is to maintain a " gate " through which proteins enter the barrel . These α subunits are controlled by binding to " cap " structures or regulatory particles that recognize polyubiquitin tags attached to protein substrates and initiate the degradation process . The overall system of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation is known as the ubiquitin @-@ proteasome system . 
 The proteasomal degradation pathway is essential for many cellular processes , including the cell cycle , the regulation of gene expression , and responses to oxidative stress . The importance of proteolytic degradation inside cells and the role of ubiquitin in proteolytic pathways was acknowledged in the award of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Aaron <unk> , Avram Hershko and Irwin Rose . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 Before the discovery of the ubiquitin proteasome system , protein degradation in cells was thought to rely mainly on lysosomes , membrane @-@ bound organelles with acidic and protease @-@ filled interiors that can degrade and then recycle exogenous proteins and aged or damaged organelles . However , work by Alfred Goldberg in 1977 on ATP @-@ dependent protein degradation in <unk> , which lack lysosomes , suggested the presence of a second intracellular degradation mechanism . This was shown in 1978 to be composed of several distinct protein chains , a novelty among proteases at the time . Later work on modification of histones led to the identification of an unexpected covalent modification of the histone protein by a bond between a lysine side chain of the histone and the C @-@ terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin , a protein that had no known function . It was then discovered that a previously identified protein associated with proteolytic degradation , known as ATP @-@ dependent proteolysis factor 1 ( APF @-@ 1 ) , was the same protein as ubiquitin . The proteolytic activities of this system was isolated as a multi @-@ protein complex originally called the multi @-@ catalytic proteinase complex by Sherwin Wilk and Marion Orlowski . Later , the ATP @-@ dependent proteolytic complex that was responsible for ubiquitin @-@ dependent protein degradation was discovered and was called the 26S proteasome . 
 Much of the early work leading up to the discovery of the ubiquitin proteasome system occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the Technion in the laboratory of Avram Hershko , where Aaron <unk> worked as a graduate student . Hershko 's year @-@ long sabbatical in the laboratory of Irwin Rose at the Fox Chase Cancer Center provided key conceptual insights , though Rose later downplayed his role in the discovery . The three shared the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work in discovering this system . 
 Although electron microscopy data revealing the stacked @-@ ring structure of the proteasome became available in the mid @-@ 1980s , the first structure of the proteasome core particle was not solved by X @-@ ray crystallography until 1994 . 
 = = Structure and organization = = 
 The proteasome subcomponents are often referred to by their Svedberg sedimentation coefficient ( denoted S ) . The proteasome most exclusively used in mammals is the cytosolic 26S proteasome , which is about 2000 kilodaltons ( kDa ) in molecular mass containing one 20S protein subunit and two 19S regulatory cap subunits . The core is hollow and provides an enclosed cavity in which proteins are degraded ; openings at the two ends of the core allow the target protein to enter . Each end of the core particle associates with a 19S regulatory subunit that contains multiple ATPase active sites and ubiquitin binding sites ; it is this structure that recognizes polyubiquitinated proteins and transfers them to the catalytic core . An alternative form of regulatory subunit called the 11S particle can associate with the core in essentially the same manner as the 19S particle ; the 11S may play a role in degradation of foreign peptides such as those produced after infection by a virus . 
 = = = 20S core particle = = = 
 The number and diversity of subunits contained in the 20S core particle depends on the organism ; the number of distinct and specialized subunits is larger in multicellular than unicellular organisms and larger in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes . All 20S particles consist of four stacked heptameric ring structures that are themselves composed of two different types of subunits ; α subunits are structural in nature , whereas β subunits are predominantly catalytic . The outer two rings in the stack consist of seven α subunits each , which serve as docking domains for the regulatory particles and the alpha subunits N @-@ termini form a gate that blocks unregulated access of substrates to the interior cavity . The inner two rings each consist of seven β subunits and contain the protease active sites that perform the proteolysis reactions . Three distinct catalytic activities were identified in the purified complex : chymotrypsin @-@ like , trypsin @-@ like and <unk> @-@ peptide hydrolyzing . The size of the proteasome is relatively conserved and is about 150 angstroms ( Å ) by 115 Å . The interior chamber is at most 53 Å wide , though the entrance can be as narrow as 13 Å , suggesting that substrate proteins must be at least partially unfolded to enter . 
 In archaea such as Thermoplasma <unk> , all the α and all the β subunits are identical , whereas eukaryotic proteasomes such as those in yeast contain seven distinct types of each subunit . In mammals , the β1 , β2 , and <unk> subunits are catalytic ; although they share a common mechanism , they have three distinct substrate specificities considered chymotrypsin @-@ like , trypsin @-@ like , and peptidyl @-@ glutamyl peptide @-@ hydrolyzing ( <unk> ) . Alternative β forms denoted <unk> , <unk> , and β5i can be expressed in hematopoietic cells in response to exposure to pro @-@ inflammatory signals such as cytokines , in particular , interferon gamma . The proteasome assembled with these alternative subunits is known as the immunoproteasome , whose substrate specificity is altered relative to the normal proteasome . 
 = = = 19S regulatory particle = = = 
 The 19S particle in eukaryotes consists of 19 individual proteins and is divisible into two subassemblies , a 9 @-@ subunit base that binds directly to the α ring of the 20S core particle , and a 10 @-@ subunit lid . Six of the nine base proteins are ATPase subunits from the AAA Family , and an evolutionary homolog of these ATPases exists in archaea , called PAN ( Proteasome @-@ Activating <unk> ) . The association of the 19S and 20S particles requires the binding of ATP to the 19S ATPase subunits , and ATP hydrolysis is required for the assembled complex to degrade folded and ubiquitinated proteins . Note that only the step of substrate unfolding requires energy from ATP hydrolysis , while ATP @-@ binding alone can support all the other steps required for protein degradation ( e.g. , complex assembly , gate opening , translocation , and proteolysis ) . In fact , ATP binding to the ATPases by itself supports the rapid degradation of unfolded proteins . However , while ATP hydrolysis is required for unfolding only , it is not yet clear whether this energy may be used in the coupling of some of these steps . 
 In 2012 , two independent efforts have elucidated the molecular architecture of the 26S proteasome by single particle electron microscopy . More recently , a pseudo @-@ atomic atomic model has been built , again using cryo @-@ EM . In the heart of the 19S , directly adjacent to the 20S , are the AAA @-@ ATPases ( AAA proteins ) that assemble to a <unk> ring of the order Rpt1 / <unk> / Rpt6 / Rpt3 / Rpt4 / <unk> . This ring is a trimer of dimers : Rpt1 / <unk> , Rpt6 / Rpt3 , and Rpt4 / <unk> <unk> via their N @-@ terminal coiled @-@ coils . These coiled @-@ coils protrude from the hexameric ring . The largest regulatory particle non @-@ ATPases <unk> and <unk> bind to the tips of Rpt1 / 2 and Rpt6 / 3 , respectively . The ubiquitin receptor <unk> binds to <unk> and completes the base cub @-@ complex . The lid covers one half of the AAA @-@ ATPase <unk> ( Rpt6 / Rpt3 / Rpt4 ) and , unexpectedly , directly contacts the 20S via <unk> and to lesser extent <unk> . The subunits <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , which are structurally related among themselves and to subunits of the <unk> complex and the Eukaryotic initiation factor 3 ( hence called PCI subunits ) assemble to a horseshoe @-@ like structure enclosing the <unk> / Rpn11 heterodimer . Rpn11 , the <unk> enzyme , is placed at the mouth of the AAA @-@ ATPase <unk> , ideally positioned to remove ubiquitin moieties immediately before translocation of substrates into the 20S . The second ubiquitin receptor identified to date , <unk> , is positioned at the periphery of the lid , near subunits <unk> and <unk> . 
 = = = Conformational changes of 19S = = = 
 The 19S regulatory particle has been observed in three strongly differing conformational states to date . Realization of all these three conformational states is likely necessary for accomplishing substrate recognition and degradation ( see below ) . A hallmark of the AAA @-@ ATPase configuration in this predominant low @-@ energy state is a <unk> or <unk> @-@ like arrangement of the AAA @-@ domains . Also in the presence of ATP but absence of substrate an alternative , less abundant conformation of the 19S is adopted primarily differing in the positioning of the lid with respect to the AAA @-@ ATPase module . In the presence of ATP @-@ <unk> or a substrate ( stabilized in a 26S mutant with defective Rpn11 ) a third conformation has been observed displaying a dramatic structural change of the AAA @-@ ATPase module . 
 = = = Regulation of the 20S by the 19S = = = 
 The 19S regulatory particle is responsible for stimulating the 20S to degrade proteins . A primary function of the 19S regulatory ATPases is to open the gate in the 20S that blocks the entry of substrates into the degradation chamber . The mechanism by which the proteasomal ATPase open this gate has been recently elucidated . 20S gate opening , and thus substrate degradation , requires the C @-@ termini of the proteasomal ATPases , which contains a specific motif ( i.e. , <unk> motif ) . The ATPases C @-@ termini bind into pockets in the top of the 20S , and tether the ATPase complex to the 20S proteolytic complex , thus joining the substrate unfolding equipment with the 20S degradation machinery . Binding of these C @-@ termini into these 20S pockets by themselves stimulates opening of the gate in the 20S in much the same way that a " key @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lock " opens a door . The precise mechanism by which this " key @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lock " mechanism functions has been structurally elucidated . 
 = = = 11S regulatory particle = = = 
 20S proteasomes can also associate with a second type of regulatory particle , the 11S regulatory particle , a heptameric structure that does not contain any ATPases and can promote the degradation of short peptides but not of complete proteins . It is presumed that this is because the complex cannot unfold larger substrates . This structure is also known as <unk> or REG . The mechanisms by which it binds to the core particle through the C @-@ terminal tails of its subunits and induces α @-@ ring conformational changes to open the 20S gate suggest a similar mechanism for the 19S particle . The expression of the 11S particle is induced by interferon gamma and is responsible , in conjunction with the immunoproteasome β subunits , for the generation of peptides that bind to the major histocompatibility complex . 
 = = Assembly = = 
 The assembly of the proteasome is a complex process due to the number of subunits that must associate to form an active complex . The β subunits are synthesized with N @-@ terminal " <unk> " that are post @-@ translationally modified during the assembly of the 20S particle to expose the proteolytic active site . The 20S particle is assembled from two half @-@ proteasomes , each of which consists of a seven @-@ membered pro @-@ β ring attached to a seven @-@ membered α ring . The association of the β rings of the two half @-@ proteasomes triggers threonine @-@ dependent <unk> of the <unk> to expose the active site . These β interactions are mediated mainly by salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions between conserved alpha helices whose disruption by mutation damages the proteasome 's ability to assemble . The assembly of the half @-@ proteasomes , in turn , is initiated by the assembly of the α subunits into their heptameric ring , forming a template for the association of the corresponding pro @-@ β ring . The assembly of α subunits has not been characterized . 
 Only recently , the assembly process of the 19S regulatory particle has been elucidated to considerable extent . The 19S regulatory particle assembles as two distinct subcomponents , the base and the lid . Assembly of the base complex is facilitated by four assembly chaperones , <unk> / <unk> , <unk> / p27 , <unk> / <unk> , and <unk> / <unk> ( names for yeast / mammals ) . These assembly chaperones bind to the AAA @-@ ATPase subunits and their main function seems to be to ensure proper assembly of the <unk> AAA @-@ ATPase ring . To date it is still under debate whether the base complex assembles separately , whether the assembly is templated by the 20S core particle , or whether alternative assembly pathways exist . In addition to the four assembly chaperones , the <unk> enzyme <unk> / <unk> also promotes base assembly , but it is not essential . The lid assembles separately in a specific order and does not require assembly chaperones . 
 = = The protein degradation process = = 
 = = = <unk> and targeting = = = 
 Proteins are targeted for degradation by the proteasome with covalent modification of a lysine residue that requires the coordinated reactions of three enzymes . In the first step , a ubiquitin @-@ activating enzyme ( known as E1 ) hydrolyzes ATP and <unk> a ubiquitin molecule . This is then transferred to E1 's active @-@ site cysteine residue in concert with the <unk> of a second ubiquitin . This <unk> ubiquitin is then transferred to a cysteine of a second enzyme , ubiquitin @-@ conjugating enzyme ( E2 ) . In the last step , a member of a highly diverse class of enzymes known as ubiquitin ligases ( E3 ) recognizes the specific protein to be ubiquitinated and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to this target protein . A target protein must be labeled with at least four ubiquitin monomers ( in the form of a polyubiquitin chain ) before it is recognized by the proteasome lid . It is therefore the E3 that confers substrate specificity to this system . The number of E1 , E2 , and E3 proteins expressed depends on the organism and cell type , but there are many different E3 enzymes present in humans , indicating that there is a huge number of targets for the ubiquitin proteasome system . 
 The mechanism by which a polyubiquitinated protein is targeted to the proteasome is not fully understood . Ubiquitin @-@ receptor proteins have an N @-@ terminal ubiquitin @-@ like ( UBL ) domain and one or more ubiquitin @-@ associated ( <unk> ) domains . The UBL domains are recognized by the 19S proteasome caps and the <unk> domains bind ubiquitin via three @-@ helix bundles . These receptor proteins may escort polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome , though the specifics of this interaction and its regulation are unclear . 
 The ubiquitin protein itself is 76 amino acids long and was named due to its ubiquitous nature , as it has a highly conserved sequence and is found in all known eukaryotic organisms . The genes encoding ubiquitin in eukaryotes are arranged in tandem repeats , possibly due to the heavy transcription demands on these genes to produce enough ubiquitin for the cell . It has been proposed that ubiquitin is the slowest @-@ evolving protein identified to date . Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues to which another ubiquitin can be <unk> , resulting in different types of polyubiquitin chains . Chains in which each additional ubiquitin is linked to lysine 48 of the previous ubiquitin have a role in proteasome targeting , while other types of chains may be involved in other processes . 
 = = = Unfolding and translocation = = = 
 After a protein has been ubiquitinated , it is recognized by the 19S regulatory particle in an ATP @-@ dependent binding step . The substrate protein must then enter the interior of the 20S particle to come in contact with the proteolytic active sites . Because the 20S particle 's central channel is narrow and gated by the N @-@ terminal tails of the α ring subunits , the substrates must be at least partially unfolded before they enter the core . The passage of the unfolded substrate into the core is called translocation and necessarily occurs after <unk> . However , the order in which substrates are <unk> and unfolded is not yet clear . Which of these processes is the rate @-@ limiting step in the overall proteolysis reaction depends on the specific substrate ; for some proteins , the unfolding process is rate @-@ limiting , while <unk> is the slowest step for other proteins . The extent to which substrates must be unfolded before translocation is not known , but substantial tertiary structure , and in particular nonlocal interactions such as disulfide bonds , are sufficient to inhibit degradation . The presence of intrinsically disordered protein segments of sufficient size , either at the protein terminus or internally , has also been proposed to facilitate efficient initiation of degradation . 
 The gate formed by the α subunits prevents peptides longer than about four residues from entering the interior of the 20S particle . The ATP molecules bound before the initial recognition step are hydrolyzed before translocation . While energy is needed for substrate unfolding , it is not required for translocation . The assembled 26S proteasome can degrade unfolded proteins in the presence of a non @-@ <unk> ATP analog , but cannot degrade folded proteins , indicating that energy from ATP hydrolysis is used for substrate unfolding . Passage of the unfolded substrate through the opened gate occurs via facilitated diffusion if the 19S cap is in the ATP @-@ bound state . 
 The mechanism for unfolding of globular proteins is necessarily general , but somewhat dependent on the amino acid sequence . Long sequences of alternating glycine and alanine have been shown to inhibit substrate unfolding , decreasing the efficiency of proteasomal degradation ; this results in the release of partially degraded byproducts , possibly due to the decoupling of the ATP hydrolysis and unfolding steps . Such glycine @-@ alanine repeats are also found in nature , for example in silk <unk> ; in particular , certain Epstein @-@ Barr virus gene products bearing this sequence can stall the proteasome , helping the virus propagate by preventing antigen presentation on the major histocompatibility complex . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The mechanism of proteolysis by the β subunits of the 20S core particle is through a threonine @-@ dependent nucleophilic attack . This mechanism may depend on an associated water molecule for deprotonation of the reactive threonine hydroxyl . Degradation occurs within the central chamber formed by the association of the two β rings and normally does not release partially degraded products , instead reducing the substrate to short polypeptides typically 7 – 9 residues long , though they can range from 4 to 25 residues , depending on the organism and substrate . The biochemical mechanism that determines product length is not fully characterized . Although the three catalytic β subunits have a common mechanism , they have slightly different substrate specificities , which are considered chymotrypsin @-@ like , trypsin @-@ like , and peptidyl @-@ glutamyl peptide @-@ hydrolyzing ( <unk> ) -like . These variations in specificity are the result of interatomic contacts with local residues near the active sites of each subunit . Each catalytic β subunit also possesses a conserved lysine residue required for proteolysis . 
 Although the proteasome normally produces very short peptide fragments , in some cases these products are themselves biologically active and functional molecules . Certain transcription factors regulating the expression of specific genes , including one component of the mammalian complex NF @-@ κB , are synthesized as inactive precursors whose ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation converts them to an active form . Such activity requires the proteasome to cleave the substrate protein internally , rather than <unk> degrading it from one terminus . It has been suggested that long loops on these proteins ' surfaces serve as the proteasomal substrates and enter the central cavity , while the majority of the protein remains outside . Similar effects have been observed in yeast proteins ; this mechanism of selective degradation is known as regulated ubiquitin / proteasome dependent processing ( <unk> ) . 
 = = = Ubiquitin @-@ independent degradation = = = 
 Although most proteasomal substrates must be ubiquitinated before being degraded , there are some exceptions to this general rule , especially when the proteasome plays a normal role in the post @-@ translational processing of the protein . The proteasomal activation of NF @-@ κB by processing <unk> into <unk> via internal proteolysis is one major example . Some proteins that are hypothesized to be unstable due to intrinsically unstructured regions , are degraded in a ubiquitin @-@ independent manner . The most well @-@ known example of a ubiquitin @-@ independent proteasome substrate is the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase . Ubiquitin @-@ independent mechanisms targeting key cell cycle regulators such as p53 have also been reported , although p53 is also subject to ubiquitin @-@ dependent degradation . Finally , structurally abnormal , misfolded , or highly oxidized proteins are also subject to ubiquitin @-@ independent and 19S @-@ independent degradation under conditions of cellular stress . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 The 20S proteasome is both ubiquitous and essential in eukaryotes . Some prokaryotes , including many archaea and the bacterial order <unk> also share homologs of the 20S proteasome , whereas most bacteria possess heat shock genes hslV and <unk> , whose gene products are a multimeric protease arranged in a two @-@ layered ring and an ATPase . The hslV protein has been hypothesized to resemble the likely ancestor of the 20S proteasome . In general , <unk> is not essential in bacteria , and not all bacteria possess it , whereas some protists possess both the 20S and the hslV systems . Many bacteria also possess other homologs of the proteasome and an associated ATPase , most notably <unk> and <unk> . This redundancy explains why the <unk> system is not essential . 
 Sequence analysis suggests that the catalytic β subunits diverged earlier in evolution than the predominantly structural α subunits . In bacteria that express a 20S proteasome , the β subunits have high sequence identity to archaeal and eukaryotic β subunits , whereas the α sequence identity is much lower . The presence of 20S proteasomes in bacteria may result from lateral gene transfer , while the diversification of subunits among eukaryotes is ascribed to multiple gene duplication events . 
 = = Cell cycle control = = 
 Cell cycle progression is controlled by ordered action of cyclin @-@ dependent kinases ( <unk> ) , activated by specific <unk> that demarcate phases of the cell cycle . Mitotic <unk> , which persist in the cell for only a few minutes , have one of the shortest life spans of all intracellular proteins . After a CDK @-@ cyclin complex has performed its function , the associated cyclin is polyubiquitinated and destroyed by the proteasome , which provides directionality for the cell cycle . In particular , exit from mitosis requires the proteasome @-@ dependent dissociation of the regulatory component cyclin B from the mitosis promoting factor complex . In vertebrate cells , " slippage " through the mitotic checkpoint leading to premature M phase exit can occur despite the delay of this exit by the spindle checkpoint . 
 Earlier cell cycle checkpoints such as post @-@ restriction point check between G1 phase and S phase similarly involve proteasomal degradation of cyclin A , whose ubiquitination is promoted by the anaphase promoting complex ( APC ) , an E3 ubiquitin ligase . The APC and the <unk> / <unk> / F @-@ box protein complex ( SCF complex ) are the two key regulators of cyclin degradation and checkpoint control ; the SCF itself is regulated by the APC via ubiquitination of the adaptor protein , <unk> , which prevents SCF activity before the G1 @-@ S transition . 
 Individual components of the 19S particle have their own regulatory roles . <unk> , a recently identified <unk> , is one of the 19S subcomponents that also tightly binds the cyclin @-@ dependent kinase <unk> and plays a key role in recognizing ubiquitinated p53 , via its affinity for the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 . <unk> is anti @-@ apoptotic and has been shown to be overexpressed in some tumor cell types such as hepatocellular carcinoma . 
 = = = Regulation of plant growth = = = 
 In plants , signaling by auxins , or phytohormones that order the direction and tropism of plant growth , induces the targeting of a class of transcription factor <unk> known as Aux / IAA proteins for proteasomal degradation . These proteins are ubiquitinated by <unk> , or SCF in complex with the auxin receptor <unk> . Degradation of Aux / IAA proteins <unk> transcription factors in the auxin @-@ response factor ( ARF ) family and induces ARF @-@ directed gene expression . The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend on the plant type and developmental stage , but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins . The specific response to ARF <unk> is thought to be mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux / IAA proteins . 
 = = = Apoptosis = = = 
 Both internal and external signals can lead to the induction of apoptosis , or programmed cell death . The resulting deconstruction of cellular components is primarily carried out by specialized proteases known as caspases , but the proteasome also plays important and diverse roles in the apoptotic process . The involvement of the proteasome in this process is indicated by both the increase in protein ubiquitination , and of E1 , E2 , and E3 enzymes that is observed well in advance of apoptosis . During apoptosis , proteasomes localized to the nucleus have also been observed to translocate to outer membrane blebs characteristic of apoptosis . 
 Proteasome inhibition has different effects on apoptosis induction in different cell types . In general , the proteasome is not required for apoptosis , although inhibiting it is pro @-@ apoptotic in most cell types that have been studied . Apoptosis is mediated through disrupting the regulated degradation of pro @-@ growth cell cycle proteins . However , some cell lines — in particular , primary cultures of quiescent and differentiated cells such as <unk> and neurons — are prevented from undergoing apoptosis on exposure to proteasome inhibitors . The mechanism for this effect is not clear , but is hypothesized to be specific to cells in quiescent states , or to result from the differential activity of the pro @-@ apoptotic kinase <unk> . The ability of proteasome inhibitors to induce apoptosis in rapidly dividing cells has been exploited in several recently developed chemotherapy agents such as bortezomib and <unk> A. 
 = = Response to cellular stress = = 
 In response to cellular stresses – such as infection , heat shock , or oxidative damage – heat shock proteins that identify misfolded or unfolded proteins and target them for proteasomal degradation are expressed . Both <unk> and Hsp90 — chaperone proteins have been implicated in increasing the activity of the ubiquitin @-@ proteasome system , though they are not direct participants in the process . Hsp70 , on the other hand , binds exposed hydrophobic patches on the surface of misfolded proteins and recruits E3 ubiquitin ligases such as CHIP to tag the proteins for proteasomal degradation . The CHIP protein ( carboxyl terminus of Hsp70 @-@ interacting protein ) is itself regulated via inhibition of interactions between the E3 enzyme CHIP and its E2 binding partner . 
 Similar mechanisms exist to promote the degradation of <unk> damaged proteins via the proteasome system . In particular , proteasomes localized to the nucleus are regulated by PARP and actively degrade inappropriately oxidized histones . <unk> proteins , which often form large amorphous aggregates in the cell , can be degraded directly by the 20S core particle without the 19S regulatory cap and do not require ATP hydrolysis or tagging with ubiquitin . However , high levels of oxidative damage increases the degree of cross @-@ linking between protein fragments , rendering the aggregates resistant to proteolysis . Larger numbers and sizes of such highly oxidized aggregates are associated with aging . 
 <unk> of the ubiquitin proteasome system may contribute to several neural diseases . It may lead to brain tumors such as <unk> . In some of the late @-@ onset neurodegenerative diseases that share aggregation of misfolded proteins as a common feature , such as Parkinson 's disease and Alzheimer 's disease , large insoluble aggregates of misfolded proteins can form and then result in neurotoxicity , through mechanisms that are not yet well understood . Decreased proteasome activity has been suggested as a cause of aggregation and Lewy body formation in Parkinson 's . This hypothesis is supported by the observation that yeast models of Parkinson 's are more susceptible to toxicity from α @-@ synuclein , the major protein component of Lewy bodies , under conditions of low proteasome activity . Impaired proteasomal activity may underlie cognitive disorders such as the autism spectrum disorders , and muscle and nerve diseases such as inclusion body myopathy . 
 = = Role in the immune system = = 
 The proteasome plays a straightforward but critical role in the function of the adaptive immune system . Peptide antigens are displayed by the major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC ) proteins on the surface of antigen @-@ presenting cells . These peptides are products of proteasomal degradation of proteins originated by the invading pathogen . Although constitutively expressed proteasomes can participate in this process , a specialized complex composed of proteins , whose expression is induced by interferon gamma , are the primary producers of peptides which are optimal in size and composition for MHC binding . These proteins whose expression increases during the immune response include the 11S regulatory particle , whose main known biological role is regulating the production of MHC ligands , and specialized β subunits called <unk> , <unk> , and β5i with altered substrate specificity . The complex formed with the specialized β subunits is known as the immunoproteasome . Another β5i variant subunit , <unk> , is expressed in the thymus , leading to a thymus @-@ specific " <unk> " whose function is as yet unclear . 
 The strength of MHC class I ligand binding is dependent on the composition of the ligand C @-@ terminus , as peptides bind by hydrogen bonding and by close contacts with a region called the " B pocket " on the MHC surface . Many MHC class I alleles prefer hydrophobic C @-@ terminal residues , and the immunoproteasome complex is more likely to generate hydrophobic C @-@ termini . 
 Due to its role in generating the activated form of NF @-@ κB , an anti @-@ apoptotic and pro @-@ inflammatory regulator of cytokine expression , proteasomal activity has been linked to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases . Increased levels of proteasome activity correlate with disease activity and have been implicated in autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis . 
 The proteasome is also involved in Intracellular antibody @-@ mediated proteolysis of antibody @-@ bound virions . In this neutralisation pathway , <unk> ( a protein of the tripartite motif family ) binds with immunoglobulin G to direct the virion to the proteasome where it is degraded . 
 = = Proteasome inhibitors = = 
 Proteasome inhibitors have effective anti @-@ tumor activity in cell culture , inducing apoptosis by disrupting the regulated degradation of pro @-@ growth cell cycle proteins . This approach of selectively inducing apoptosis in tumor cells has proven effective in animal models and human trials . 
 Lactacystin , a natural product synthesized by Streptomyces bacteria , was the first non @-@ peptidic proteasome inhibitor discovered and is widely used as a research tool in biochemistry and cell biology . Lactacystin was licensed to <unk> / <unk> , which was acquired by Millennium Pharmaceuticals , now part of Takeda Pharmaceuticals . Lactacystin covalently modifies the amino @-@ terminal threonine of catalytic β subunits of the proteasome , particularly the <unk> subunit responsible for the proteasome 's chymotrypsin @-@ like activity . This discovery helped to establish the proteasome as a mechanistically novel class of protease : an amino @-@ terminal threonine protease . 
 Bortezomib ( <unk> MG132 ) , a molecule developed by Millennium Pharmaceuticals and marketed as <unk> , is the first proteasome inhibitor to reach clinical use as a chemotherapy agent . Bortezomib is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma . Notably , multiple myeloma has been observed to result in increased proteasome @-@ derived peptide levels in blood serum that decrease to normal levels in response to successful chemotherapy . Studies in animals have indicated that bortezomib may also have clinically significant effects in pancreatic cancer . Preclinical and early clinical studies have been started to examine bortezomib 's effectiveness in treating other B @-@ cell @-@ related cancers , particularly some types of non @-@ Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Clinical results also seem to justify use of proteasome inhibitor combined with chemotherapy , for B @-@ cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia Proteasome inhibitor can kill some types of cultured leukemia cells that are resistant to glucocorticoid . 
 The molecule ritonavir , marketed as <unk> , was developed as a protease inhibitor and used to target HIV infection . However , it has been shown to inhibit proteasomes as well as free proteases ; to be specific , the chymotrypsin @-@ like activity of the proteasome is inhibited by ritonavir , while the trypsin @-@ like activity is somewhat enhanced . Studies in animal models suggest that ritonavir may have inhibitory effects on the growth of glioma cells . 
 Proteasome inhibitors have also shown promise in treating autoimmune diseases in animal models . For example , studies in mice bearing human skin grafts found a reduction in the size of lesions from psoriasis after treatment with a proteasome inhibitor . Inhibitors also show positive effects in rodent models of asthma . 
 Labeling and inhibition of the proteasome is also of interest in laboratory settings for both in vitro and in vivo study of proteasomal activity in cells . The most commonly used laboratory inhibitors are <unk> and the peptide aldehyde MG132 initially developed by Goldberg lab . Fluorescent inhibitors have also been developed to specifically label the active sites of the assembled proteasome . 
 = = Clinical significance = = 
 The Proteasome and its subunits are of clinical significance for at least two reasons : ( 1 ) a compromised complex assembly or a dysfunctional proteasome can be associated with the underlying pathophysiology of specific diseases , and ( 2 ) they can be exploited as drug targets for therapeutic interventions . More recently , more effort has been made to consider the proteasome for the development of novel diagnostic markers and strategies . An improved and comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of the proteasome should lead to clinical applications in the future . 
 The proteasomes form a pivotal component for the Ubiquitin @-@ Proteasome System ( UPS ) and corresponding cellular Protein Quality Control ( <unk> ) . Protein ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis and degradation by the proteasome are important mechanisms in the regulation of the cell cycle , cell growth and differentiation , gene transcription , signal transduction and apoptosis . Subsequently , a compromised proteasome complex assembly and function lead to reduced proteolytic activities and the accumulation of damaged or misfolded protein species . Such protein accumulation may contribute to the pathogenesis and phenotypic characteristics in neurodegenerative diseases , cardiovascular diseases , inflammatory responses and autoimmune diseases , and systemic DNA damage responses leading to malignancies . 
 Several experimental and clinical studies have indicated that aberrations and <unk> of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and <unk> disorders , including Alzheimer 's disease , Parkinson 's disease and Pick 's disease , Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , Huntington 's disease , Creutzfeldt @-@ Jacob disease , and motor neuron diseases , polyglutamine ( <unk> ) diseases , Muscular <unk> and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia . As part of the Ubiquitin @-@ Proteasome System ( UPS ) , the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac <unk> injury , ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure . Additionally , evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation . UPS proteolysis plays a major role in responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer . Accordingly , gene expression by degradation of transcription factors , such as p53 , c @-@ Jun , c @-@ Fos , NF @-@ κB , c @-@ Myc , HIF @-@ 1α , <unk> , <unk> , sterol @-@ regulated element @-@ binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies . Moreover , the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as <unk> polyposis coli ( APC ) in colorectal cancer , <unk> ( Rb ) . and von Hippel @-@ Lindau tumor suppressor ( <unk> ) , as well as a number of proto @-@ oncogenes ( Raf , Myc , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Mos , <unk> ) .The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses . This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF @-@ κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF @-@ α , IL @-@ β , IL @-@ 8 , adhesion molecules ( ICAM @-@ 1 , <unk> @-@ 1 , P <unk> ) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide ( NO ) . Additionally , the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation , mainly through proteolysis of <unk> and the degradation of CDK inhibitors . Lastly , autoimmune disease patients with SLE , Sjogren 's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers . 
 = Mary Celeste = 
 Mary Celeste ( often misreported as Marie Celeste ) was an American merchant vessel brigantine that was found adrift and deserted in the Atlantic Ocean , off the Azores Islands , Portugal , on December 5 , 1872 , by the Canadian brigantine Dei Gratia . She was in a dishevelled but seaworthy condition , under partial sail , with nobody on board , and her lifeboat missing . The last log entry was dated ten days earlier . She had left New York City for Genoa on November 7 , and on discovery was still amply provisioned . Her cargo of denatured alcohol was intact , and the captain 's and crew 's personal belongings were undisturbed . None of those who had been on board , the captain and his wife , their two @-@ year @-@ old daughter , and the crew of seven , were ever seen or heard from again . 
 Mary Celeste was built in Spencer 's Island , Nova Scotia and launched under British registration as Amazon , in 1861 . She transferred to American ownership and registration in 1868 , when she acquired her new name , and thereafter sailed uneventfully until her 1872 voyage . At the salvage hearings in Gibraltar , following her recovery , the court 's officers considered various possibilities of foul play , including mutiny by Mary Celeste 's crew , piracy by the Dei Gratia crew or others , and conspiracy to carry out insurance or salvage fraud . No convincing evidence was found to support these theories , but unresolved suspicions led to a relatively low salvage award . 
 The inconclusive nature of the hearings helped to foster continued speculation as to the nature of the mystery , and the story has repeatedly been complicated by false detail and fantasy . Hypotheses that have been advanced include the effects on the crew of alcohol fumes rising from the cargo , submarine earthquakes ( <unk> ) , waterspouts , attacks by giant squid , and paranormal intervention . 
 After the Gibraltar hearings , Mary Celeste continued in service under new owners . In 1885 , her captain deliberately wrecked her off the coast of Haiti , as part of an attempted insurance fraud . The story of her 1872 abandonment has been recounted and dramatized many times , in documentaries , novels , plays and films , and the name of the ship has become synonymous with unexplained desertion . 
 In 1884 , Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a short story based on the mystery , but spelled the vessel 's name as Marie Celeste . This spelling has now become more common than the original in everyday use .

 = = = Amazon = = = 
 The keel of the future Mary Celeste was laid in late 1860 at the shipyard of Joshua <unk> in the village of Spencer 's Island , on the shores of the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia . The ship was constructed of locally felled timber , with two masts , and was rigged as a brigantine ; she was carvel @-@ built , with the hull planking flush rather than overlapping . She was launched on May 18 , 1861 , given the name Amazon , and registered at nearby <unk> on June 10 , 1861 . Her registration documents described her as 99 @.@ 3 feet ( 30 @.@ 3 m ) in length , 25 @.@ 5 feet ( 7 @.@ 8 m ) broad , with a depth of 11 @.@ 7 feet ( 3 @.@ 6 m ) , and of 198 @.@ 42 gross tonnage . She was owned by a local consortium of nine people , headed by <unk> ; among the co @-@ owners was Robert McLellan , the ship 's first captain . 
 For her maiden voyage in June 1861 , Amazon sailed to Five Islands to take on a cargo of timber for passage across the Atlantic to London . After supervising the ship 's loading , Captain McLellan fell ill ; his condition worsened , and Amazon returned to Spencer 's Island where McLellan died on June 19 . John Nutting Parker took over as captain , and resumed the voyage to London , in the course of which Amazon encountered further misadventures . She collided with fishing equipment in the narrows off Eastport , Maine , and after leaving London ran into and sank a brig in the English Channel . 
 Parker remained in command for two years , during which Amazon worked mainly in the West Indies trade . She crossed the Atlantic to France in November 1861 , and in Marseille was the subject of a painting , possibly by Honoré de <unk> , a well @-@ known maritime artist of the Marseilles School . In 1863 Parker was succeeded by William Thompson , who remained in command until 1867 . These were quiet years ; Amazon 's mate later recalled that " we went to the West Indies , England and the Mediterranean — what we call the foreign trade . Not a thing unusual happened " . In October 1867 , at Cape Breton Island , Amazon was driven ashore in a storm , and was so badly damaged that her owners abandoned her as a wreck . On October 15 , she was acquired as a derelict by Alexander McBean , of Glace Bay , Nova Scotia . 
 = = = New owners , new name = = = 
 Within a month , McBean sold the wreck to a local businessman , who in November 1868 , sold it to Richard W. Haines , an American mariner from New York . Haines paid US $ 1 @,@ 750 for the wreck , and then spent $ 8 @,@ 825 restoring it . He made himself her captain , and in December 1868 registered her with the Collector of Customs in New York as an American vessel , under a new name , Mary Celeste . 
 In October 1869 , the ship was seized by Haines 's creditors , and sold to a New York consortium headed by James H. Winchester . During the next three years , the composition of this consortium changed several times , although Winchester retained at least a half @-@ share throughout . There is no record of Mary Celeste 's trading activities during this period . Early in 1872 , the ship underwent a major refit , costing $ 10 @,@ 000 , which enlarged her considerably . Her length was increased to 103 feet ( 31 m ) , her breadth to 25 @.@ 7 feet ( 7 @.@ 8 m ) and her depth to 16 @.@ 2 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) . Among the structural changes , a second deck was added ; an inspector 's report refers to extensions to the poop , new transoms and the replacement of many timbers . The work increased the ship 's tonnage to 282 @.@ 28 . On October 29 , 1872 , the consortium was made up of Winchester , with six @-@ <unk> ; two minor investors with one @-@ twelfth apiece , and the remaining four @-@ <unk> held by the ship 's new captain , Benjamin Spooner Briggs . 
 = = = Captain Briggs and crew = = = 
 Benjamin Briggs was born in Wareham , Massachusetts on April 24 , 1835 , one of five sons of sea captain Nathan Briggs . All but one of the sons went to sea , two becoming captains . Benjamin was an observant Christian who read the Bible regularly and often bore witness to his faith at prayer meetings . In 1862 , he married his cousin Sarah Elizabeth Cobb , and enjoyed a Mediterranean honeymoon on board his schooner Forest King . Two children were born : son Arthur in September 1865 , and daughter Sophia Matilda in October 1870 . 
 By the time of Sophia 's birth , Briggs had achieved a high standing within his profession . Nevertheless , he considered retiring from the sea to go into business with his seafaring brother Oliver , who had also grown tired of the wandering life . They did not proceed with this project , but instead each invested his savings in a share of a ship : Oliver in Julia A. Hallock , and Benjamin in Mary Celeste . In October 1872 , Benjamin took command of Mary Celeste for her first voyage following her extensive New York refit , which took her to Genoa in Italy . He arranged for his wife and infant daughter to accompany him , while his school @-@ aged son was left at home with his grandmother . 
 Briggs chose the crew for this voyage with care . First mate Albert G. Richardson was married to a niece of Winchester and had sailed under Briggs before . Second mate Andrew Gilling , aged about 25 , was Danish in origin although born in New York . The steward , newly married Edward William Head , was signed on with a personal recommendation from Winchester . The four general seaman were all Germans from the Frisian Islands : the brothers Volkert and Boz Lorenzen , Arian Martens , and Gottlieb <unk> . A later testimonial described them as " peaceable and first @-@ class sailors " . In a letter to his mother shortly before the voyage , Briggs declared himself eminently satisfied with ship and crew . Sarah Briggs informed her mother that the crew appeared to be quietly capable , " if they continue as they have begun " . 
 = = Abandonment = = 
 = = = New York = = = 
 On October 20 , 1872 , Briggs arrived at Pier 50 on the East River , New York City , to supervise the loading of the ship 's cargo for Genoa : 1 @,@ 701 barrels of poisonous denatured alcohol . A week later , Briggs was joined by his wife and baby daughter . On Sunday , November 3 , Briggs wrote to his mother , telling her that he intended to leave on Tuesday , adding that " Our vessel is in beautiful trim and I hope we shall have a fine passage " . 
 On Tuesday morning , November 5 , Mary Celeste left Pier 50 and moved into New York Harbor . The weather was uncertain , and Briggs decided to wait for better conditions . He anchored the ship just off Staten Island , where Sarah used the delay to send a final letter to her mother @-@ in @-@ law , in which she wrote : " Tell Arthur I make great dependence on the letters I shall get from him , and will try to remember anything that happens on the voyage which he would be pleased to hear " . On November 7 , when the weather eased , Mary Celeste left the harbor and went out into the Atlantic . 
 While Mary Celeste prepared to sail , another brigantine , the Canadian Dei Gratia , lay in nearby Hoboken , New Jersey , awaiting a cargo of petroleum destined for Genoa via Gibraltar . Her captain , David Morehouse , and his first mate Oliver Deveau , were Nova Scotians , both highly experienced and respected seamen . As captains with common interests , it is likely that Morehouse and Briggs knew each other , if only casually . Some accounts assert that they were close friends who , on the evening before Mary Celeste 's departure , dined together , but the evidence for this is limited to a recollection by Morehouse 's widow , 50 years after the event . Dei Gratia departed for Gibraltar on November 15 , eight days after Mary Celeste , following the same general route . 
 = = = Derelict = = = 
 Dei Gratia had reached a position of 38 ° <unk> , 17 ° <unk> , midway between the Azores and the coast of Portugal at about 1 pm on Wednesday , December 4 , 1872 , land time ( Thursday , December 5 , sea time ) , . As Captain Morehouse came on deck , the helmsman reported a vessel about 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) distant , heading unsteadily towards Dei Gratia . The ship 's erratic movements and the odd set of her sails led Morehouse to suspect that something was wrong . As the vessels drew close , he could see nobody on deck , and he received no reply to his signals , so he sent Deveau and second mate John Wright to investigate . The pair established that she was the Mary Celeste from the name on her stern , then climbed aboard where they found the ship deserted . The sails , partly set , were in a poor condition , some missing altogether , and much of the rigging was damaged , with ropes hanging loosely over the sides . The main hatch cover was secure , but the fore and <unk> hatches were open , their covers beside them on the deck . The ship 's single lifeboat was missing , a small yawl that had apparently been stowed across the main hatch , while the binnacle housing the ship 's compass had shifted from its place , its glass cover broken . There was about 3 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) of water in the hold , a significant but not alarming amount for a ship this size . A makeshift sounding rod ( a device for measuring the amount of water in the hold ) was found abandoned on the deck . 
 The last entry on the ship 's daily log , found in the mate 's cabin , was dated at 8 : 00 am on November 25 , nine days earlier . It recorded Mary Celeste 's position then as 37 ° <unk> , 25 ° <unk> , off Santa Maria Island in the Azores — nearly 400 nautical miles ( 740 km ) from the point where Dei Gratia encountered her . Deveau saw that the cabin interiors were wet and untidy from water which had entered through doorways and skylights , but were otherwise in reasonable order . In Briggs 's cabin , Deveau found personal items scattered about , including a sheathed sword under the bed , but most of the ship 's papers were missing , together with the captain 's navigational instruments . Galley equipment was neatly stowed away ; there was no food prepared or under preparation , but there were ample provisions in the stores . There were no obvious signs of fire or violence ; the evidence indicated an orderly departure from the ship , by means of the missing lifeboat . 
 Deveau reported these findings to Morehouse , who agreed to bring the derelict into Gibraltar , 600 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 100 km ) away . Under maritime law , a salvor could expect a substantial share of the combined value of rescued vessel and cargo , the exact award depending on the degree of danger inherent in the salvaging . Morehouse divided Dei Gratia 's crew of eight between the two vessels , sending Deveau and two experienced seamen to Mary Celeste , while he and four others remained on Dei Gratia . The weather was relatively calm for most of the way to Gibraltar , but with each ship seriously undermanned , progress was slow . Dei Gratia reached Gibraltar on December 12 , 1872 , and Mary Celeste , which had encountered fog , arrived on the following morning . She was immediately impounded by the vice admiralty court , preparatory to salvage hearings . Deveau wrote to his wife that the ordeal of bringing the ship in was such that " I can hardly tell what I am made of , but I do not care so long as I got in safe . I shall be well paid for the Mary Celeste " . 
 = = Gibraltar salvage hearings = = 
 The salvage court hearings began in Gibraltar on December 17 , 1872 , under Sir James Cochrane , the chief justice of Gibraltar . The hearing was conducted by Frederick Solly Flood , Attorney General of Gibraltar who was also Advocate @-@ General and Proctor for the Queen in Her Office of Admiralty . Flood was described by one historian of the Mary Celeste affair as a man " whose arrogance and pomposity were inversely proportional to his IQ " , and as " the sort of man who , once he had made up his mind about something , couldn 't be shifted " . The testimonies of Deveau and Wright convinced Flood unalterably that a crime had been committed , a belief picked up by the New York Shipping and Commercial List on December 21 : " The inference is that there has been foul play somewhere , and that alcohol is at the bottom of it " . 
 On December 23 , Flood ordered an examination of Mary Celeste , which was carried out by John Austin , Surveyor of Shipping , with the assistance of a diver , Ricardo <unk> . Austin noted cuts on each side of the bow , caused , he thought , by a sharp instrument , and found possible traces of blood on the captain 's sword . His report emphasized that the ship did not appear to have been struck by heavy weather , citing a phial of sewing machine oil found upright in its place ; Austin did not acknowledge that the phial might have been replaced since the abandonment , nor did the court raise this point . <unk> 's report on the hull concluded that the ship had not been involved in a collision or run aground . A further inspection by a group of Royal Naval captains endorsed Austin 's opinion that the cuts on the bow had been caused deliberately . They also discovered stains on one of the ship 's rails that might have been blood , together with a deep mark possibly caused by an axe . These findings strengthened Flood 's suspicions that human wrongdoing rather than natural disaster lay behind the mystery . On January 22 , 1873 , he sent the reports to the Board of Trade in London , adding his own conclusion that the crew had got at the alcohol ( he ignored its non @-@ <unk> ) and murdered the Briggs family and the ship 's officers in a drunken frenzy . They had cut the bows to simulate a collision , then fled in the yawl to suffer an unknown fate . Flood thought that Morehouse and his men were hiding something , specifically that Mary Celeste had been abandoned in a more easterly location , and that the log had been doctored . He could not accept that Mary Celeste could have traveled so far while unmanned . 
 James Winchester arrived in Gibraltar on January 15 , to inquire when Mary Celeste might be released to deliver its cargo . Flood demanded a surety of $ 15 @,@ 000 , money which Winchester did not have . He became aware that Flood thought he might have deliberately engaged a crew that would kill Briggs and his officers , as part of some conspiracy . On January 29 , during a series of sharp exchanges with Flood , Winchester testified to Briggs 's high character , and insisted that he would not have abandoned the ship except in extremity . Flood 's theories of mutiny and murder received significant setbacks when scientific analysis of the stains found on the sword and elsewhere on the ship showed that they were not blood . A second blow to Flood followed in a report commissioned by Horatio Sprague , the American consul in Gibraltar , from Captain Shufeldt of the US Navy . In Shufeldt 's view the marks on the bow were not man @-@ made , but came from the natural actions of the sea on the ship 's timbers . 
 With nothing concrete to support his suspicions , Flood reluctantly released Mary Celeste from the court 's jurisdiction on February 25 . Two weeks later , with a locally raised crew headed by Captain George Blatchford from Massachusetts , she left Gibraltar for Genoa . The question of the salvage payment was decided on April 8 , when Cochrane announced the award : £ 1 @,@ 700 , or about one @-@ fifth of the total value of ship and cargo . This was far lower than the general expectation — one authority thought that the award should have been twice or even three times that amount , given the level of hazard in bringing the derelict into port . Cochrane 's final words were harshly critical of Morehouse for his decision , earlier in the hearing , to send Dei Gratia under Deveau to deliver its cargo of petroleum — although Morehouse had remained in Gibraltar at the disposal of the court . Cochrane 's tone carried an implication of wrongdoing which , says Hicks , ensured that Morehouse and his crew " would be under suspicion in the court of public opinion forever " . 
 = = Proposed solutions = = 
 = = = Foul play = = = 
 Although the evidence in Gibraltar failed to support Flood 's theories of murder and conspiracy , the suspicion of foul play lingered . Insurance fraud on the part of Winchester was briefly suspected , on the grounds of newspaper reports that Mary Celeste had been heavily over @-@ insured . Winchester was able to refute these allegations , and no inquiry was instituted by the insurance companies which had issued the policies . In 1931 an article in the Quarterly Review suggested that Morehouse could have lain in wait for Mary Celeste , then lured Briggs and his crew aboard Dei Gratia and killed them there . Paul Begg , in his account of the mystery , comments that this theory ignores undisputed facts : Dei Gratia left New York eight days after Mary Celeste , was a slower ship , and would not have caught Mary Celeste before the latter reached Gibraltar . Another theory posits that Briggs and Morehouse were partners in a conspiracy to share the salvage proceedings . The unsubstantiated friendship between the two captains has been cited by commentators as making such a plan a plausible explanation . Hicks comments that " if Morehouse and Briggs had been planning such a scam , they would not have devised such an attention @-@ drawing mystery " , and also asks why , if Briggs was intending to disappear permanently , he left his son Arthur behind . 
 Other theories of foul play have suggested an attack by <unk> pirates , who were active off the coast of Morocco in the 1870s . Charles <unk> Fay , in his 1942 account , observes that pirates would have looted the ship , yet the personal possessions of captain and crew , some of significant value , were left undisturbed . In 1925 , the historian John Gilbert Lockhart surmised that Briggs , in a fit of a religious mania , had slaughtered all on board and then killed himself . In a later edition of his book Lockhart , who had by then spoken to Briggs 's descendants , apologized and withdrew this theory . 
 = = = Natural phenomena = = = 
 Commentators generally agree that , to precipitate such a course of action as abandonment of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship , with ample provisions , some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen . In his evidence to the enquiry , Deveau ventured an explanation based on the sounding rod found on the derelict 's deck . He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding which , because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap , had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly . A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship , and the ragged state of her rigging and sails . The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps , leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had , and was in danger of sinking . 
 Other proffered explanations are the appearance of a displaced iceberg ; the fear of running aground while becalmed , and a sudden " seaquake " . <unk> evidence suggests the improbability of an iceberg drifting so far south , and had it done so it would have been spotted by other ships . Begg gives more consideration to the theory that Mary Celeste , while becalmed , began drifting towards the <unk> reef off Santa Maria Island . Fearing she would run aground , Briggs launched the yawl in the hope of reaching land . The wind then picked up and blew Mary Celeste away from the reef , but in the rising seas the yawl was swamped , and sank . The weakness of this theory is that if the ship had been becalmed , all sails would have been set to catch any available breeze , yet the ship was found with many of its sails furled . 
 As to the seaquake theory , this disturbance – an earthquake on the sea bed – could , it is surmised , have caused sufficient turbulence on the surface to damage parts of the cargo , thus releasing noxious fumes . The displaced hatches might indicate that an inspection , or an attempted airing , took place . Rising fears of an imminent explosion could plausibly have led Briggs to order the abandonment . The New York World of January 24 , 1886 , drew attention to a case where a vessel carrying alcohol had exploded . The same journal 's issue of February 9 , 1913 , cited a seepage of alcohol through a few porous barrels as the source of gases that may have caused or threatened an explosion in the hold . Briggs 's cousin Oliver Cobb was a strong proponent of this theory as providing a sufficiently alarming scenario — rumblings from the hold , the smell of escaping fumes and possibly an explosion — for Briggs to have ordered the evacuation of the ship . The lack of damage from an explosion and the generally sound state of the cargo upon discovery tend to weaken this case . In 2006 an experiment was carried out for Channel Five television by Andrea Sella of University College , London , the results of which helped to revive the " explosion " theory . Sella built a model of the hold , with paper cartons representing the barrels . Using butane gas , he created an explosion , which caused a considerable blast and ball of flame , but contrary to expectation , no fire damage within the replica hold . " What we created was a pressure @-@ wave type of explosion . There was a spectacular wave of flame but , behind it , was relatively cool air . No soot was left behind and there was no burning or scorching " . 
 Cobb believed that the transfer of personnel to the yawl may have been intended as a temporary safety measure . He speculated from Deveau 's report on the state of the rigging and ropes that the ship 's main <unk> may have been used to attach the yawl to the ship . Thus , when the danger had passed , the company could return on board . The line could subsequently have parted , whereupon Mary Celeste sailed away empty while the yawl foundered with its occupants . Begg notes the illogicality of attaching the yawl to a vessel that the crew thought was about to explode or sink , while the modern writer Macdonald Hastings asks whether Briggs , an experienced captain , would have effected a panicky abandonment of the ship when , " if the Mary Celeste had blown her timbers , she would still have been a better bet for survival than the ship 's boat " . If this is what happened , Briggs " behaved like a fool ; worse , a frightened one " . 
 = = Myths and false histories = = 
 In the decades that followed , fact and fiction became intertwined . As early as June 1883 , the Los Angeles Times retold the Mary Celeste story with invented detail : " Every sail was set , the tiller was lashed fast , not a rope was out of place ... The fire was burning in the galley . The dinner was standing <unk> and scarcely cold ... the log [ was ] written up to the hour of her discovery " . Twenty years later , in the November 1906 Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine , Mary Celeste was recorded as drifting off the Cape Verde Islands , some 1 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 600 km ) south of the actual location . Among many inaccuracies , the first mate was " a man named Briggs " , and there were live chickens on board . 
 The most influential retelling , which according to many commentators ensured that the Mary Celeste affair would never be forgotten , was a story in the January 1884 issue of the Cornhill Magazine . This was an early work of Arthur Conan Doyle , then a 25 @-@ year @-@ old ship 's surgeon . Doyle 's story , entitled " J. <unk> Jephson 's Statement " , did not adhere to the facts ; he renamed the ship " Marie Celeste " , the captain 's name was " J. W. Tibbs " , the fatal voyage took place in 1873 and was from Boston to Lisbon . The vessel carried passengers , among them the eponymous Jephson . In the story , another passenger , a fanatic named Septimus Goring with a hatred of the white race , has <unk> members of the crew to murder Tibbs and take the vessel to the shores of Western Africa . Here , the rest of the ship 's company is killed , save for Jephson who is spared because he possesses a magical charm that is venerated by Goring and his accomplices . Doyle had not expected his story to be taken seriously , but Sprague , still serving as the US consul in Gibraltar , was sufficiently intrigued to inquire if any part of the story might be true . 
 In 1913 , The Strand Magazine provided another alleged survivor 's account , from one " Abel <unk> " , supposedly Mary Celeste 's steward . In this version all on board ( except <unk> ) were drowned or eaten by sharks , when a temporary platform , on which they had crowded to watch a swimming contest , collapsed into the sea . Unlike Doyle 's story , this was proposed by the magazine as a serious solution to the enigma , but it contained many simple errors : " Griggs " for Briggs , " Boyce " for Morehouse , Briggs 's daughter as a seven @-@ year @-@ old child rather than a two @-@ year @-@ old , a crew of 13 and an ignorance of nautical language . Many more people were convinced by a plausible literary hoax of the 1920s , perpetrated by an Irish writer , Laurence J. Keating . Again presented as a survivor 's story — one " John Pemberton " — this told a complex tale of murder , madness and collusion with the Dei Gratia . It included basic errors such as using Doyle 's name " Marie Celeste " , and <unk> key personnel . Nevertheless , the story was so convincingly told that the New York Herald Tribune of July 26 , 1926 , thought its truth beyond dispute . Hastings describes Keating 's hoax as " an impudent trick , by a man not without imaginative ability " . 
 In 1924 , the Daily Express published a story from a retired naval war hero , Captain R. Lucy , whose informant , allegedly , was Mary Celeste 's former bosun — no such person is recorded in the registered crew list . In this tale , Briggs and his crew are cast in the role of predators ; they sight a derelict steamer , which they board and find deserted , with £ 3 @,@ 500 @-@ worth of gold and silver in its safe . They decide to split the money , abandon Mary Celeste , and seek new lives in Spain , which they reach by using the steamer 's lifeboats . Hastings finds it astonishing that such an unlikely story was , for a time , widely believed ; readers , he says " were fooled by the magic of print " . 
 Chambers 's Journal of September 17 , 1904 , suggests that the entire complement of Mary Celeste was plucked off one by one by a giant octopus or squid . According to the Natural History Museum , giant squid , or <unk> dux , can reach 49 feet ( 15 m ) in length ; they have been known to attack ships . Begg remarks that while such a creature could conceivably have picked off a crew member , it could hardly have taken the yawl and the captain 's navigation instruments . Other explanations have suggested paranormal intervention ; an undated edition of the British Journal of Astrology describes the Mary Celeste story as " a mystical experience , connecting it by processes of reasoning beyond the power of ordinary human understanding , with the Great Pyramid of <unk> , the lost continent of Atlantis , and the British Israel Movement " . The Bermuda Triangle has been invoked , even though Mary Celeste was abandoned in a completely different part of the Atlantic . Similar fantasies have considered theories of abduction by aliens in flying saucers . 
 = = Later career and final voyage = = 
 Mary Celeste left Genoa on June 26 , 1873 , and arrived in New York on September 19 . The Gibraltar hearings , with newspaper stories of bloodshed and murder , had made her an unpopular ship ; Hastings records that she " rotted on wharves where nobody wanted her " . In February 1874 , the consortium sold the ship , at a considerable loss , to a partnership of New York businessmen . 
 Under this new ownership , Mary Celeste sailed mainly in the West Indian and Indian Ocean routes , regularly losing money . Details of her movements occasionally appeared in the shipping news ; in February 1879 , she was reported at the island of St. Helena , where she had called to seek medical assistance for her captain , Edgar Tuthill , who had fallen ill . Tuthill died on the island , encouraging the idea that the ship was cursed — he was her third captain to die prematurely . In February 1880 , the owners sold the Mary Celeste to a partnership of Bostonians headed by Wesley Gove . A new captain , Thomas L. Fleming , remained in the post until August 1884 , when he was replaced by Gilman C. Parker . During these years , the ship 's port of registration changed several times , before reverting to Boston . There are no records of her voyages during this time , although Brian Hicks , in his study of the affair , asserts that Gove tried hard to make a success of her . 
 In November 1884 , Parker conspired with a group of Boston shippers , who filled Mary Celeste with a largely worthless cargo , misrepresented on the ship 's manifest as valuable goods and insured for US $ 30 @,@ 000 ( $ 790 @,@ 100 today ) . On December 16 , Parker set out for Port @-@ au @-@ Prince , the capital and chief port of Haiti . On January 3 , 1885 , Mary Celeste approached the port via the channel between Gonâve Island and the mainland , in which lay a large and well @-@ charted coral reef , the <unk> Bank . Parker deliberately ran the ship on to this reef , ripping out her bottom and wrecking her beyond repair . He and the crew then rowed themselves ashore , where Parker sold the salvageable cargo for $ 500 to the American consul , and instituted insurance claims for the alleged value . 
 When the consul discovered what he had bought was almost worthless , the insurance company began a thorough investigation , which soon revealed the truth of the over @-@ insured cargo . In July 1885 , Parker and the shippers were tried in Boston for conspiracy to commit insurance fraud . Parker was additionally charged with " wilfully cast [ ing ] away the ship " , a crime known as barratry and at the time carrying the death penalty . The conspiracy case was heard first , but on August 15 , the jury announced that they could not agree on a verdict . Some jurors were unwilling to risk prejudicing Parker 's forthcoming capital trial by finding him guilty on the conspiracy charge . Rather than ordering an expensive retrial , the judge negotiated an arrangement whereby the defendants withdrew their insurance claims and repaid all they had received . The barratry charge against Parker was deferred , and he was allowed to go free . Nevertheless , his professional reputation was ruined , and he died in poverty three months later . One of his co @-@ defendants went mad , and another committed suicide . Begg observes that " if the court of man could not punish these men ... the curse that had <unk> the ship since her first skipper Robert McLellan had died on her maiden voyage could reach beyond the vessel 's watery grave and exact its own terrible retribution . " 
 In August 2001 , an expedition headed by the marine archaeologist and author Clive Cussler announced that they had found the remains of a ship embedded in the <unk> reef . Only a few pieces of timber and some metal artifacts could be salvaged , the remainder of the wreckage being lost within the coral . Initial tests on the wood indicated that it was the type extensively used in New York shipyards at the time of Mary Celeste 's 1872 refit , and it seemed the remains of the Mary Celeste had been found . However , dendrochronological tests carried out by Scott St George of the Geological Survey of Canada showed that the wood came from trees , most probably from the US state of Georgia , that would still have been growing in 1894 , about ten years after the ship 's demise .

 Mary Celeste was not the first reported case of a ship being found strangely deserted on the high seas . Rupert Gould , a naval officer and investigator of maritime mysteries , lists several such occurrences between 1840 and 1855 . Whatever the truth of these stories , it is the Mary Celeste that is remembered ; the ship 's name , or Doyle 's version of it , has become fixed in people 's minds as synonymous with inexplicable desertion . The Oxford English Dictionary includes an entry for the term Marie Celeste , defining it as " <unk> : a place suddenly and inexplicably deserted " , with citations from 1966 onwards using this spelling ; Mary Celeste is shown as an alternative spelling . 
 In October 1955 , the MV <unk> , a 70 @-@ ton motor vessel , disappeared in the South Pacific while traveling between Samoa and Tokelau , with 25 people on board . The vessel was found a month later , deserted and drifting north of Vanua Levu , 600 miles ( 970 km ) from its route . None of those aboard was seen again , and a commission of inquiry failed to establish an explanation . David Wright , the affair 's principal historian , has described the case as " a classic marine mystery of Mary Celeste proportions " . 
 The Mary Celeste story inspired two well @-@ received radio plays in the 1930s , by L. Du Garde Peach and Tim Healey respectively , and a stage version of Peach 's play in 1949 . Several novels have been published , generally offering natural rather than fantastic explanations . In 1935 , the British film company Hammer Film Productions issued The Mystery of the Mary Celeste ( retitled Phantom Ship for American audiences ) , starring Bela Lugosi as a deranged sailor . It was not a commercial success , although Begg considers it " a period piece well worth watching " . A 1938 short film titled The Ship That Died presents dramatizations of a range of theories to explain the abandonment : mutiny , fear of explosion due to alcohol fumes , and the supernatural . A 1965 episode of Doctor Who , entitled “ Flight Through Eternity ” , takes place on the Mary Celeste — in the episode the crew are scared into abandoning ship by the arrival of the <unk> , who were chasing the Doctor and his companions . The January 24 , 1980 episode of the paranormal investigation television series In Search of ... focused on the mystery . In November 2007 , the Smithsonian Channel screened a documentary , The True Story of the Mary Celeste , which investigated many aspects of the case without offering any definite solution . 
 At Spencer 's Island , Mary Celeste and her lost crew are commemorated by a monument at the site of the brigantine 's construction and by a memorial outdoor cinema built in the shape of the vessel 's hull . The ship has featured on postage stamps issued by the Maldive Islands , and by Gibraltar . 
 = Coast Guard Squadron One = 
 Coast Guard Squadron One , also known in official message traffic as <unk> ONE or <unk> , was a combat unit formed by the United States Coast Guard in 1965 for service during the Vietnam War . Placed under the operational control of the United States Navy , it was assigned duties in Operation Market Time . Its formation marked the first time since World War II that Coast Guard personnel were used extensively in a combat environment . 
 The squadron operated divisions in three separate areas during the period of 1965 to 1970 . Twenty @-@ six Point @-@ class cutters with their crews and a squadron support staff were assigned to the U.S. Navy with the mission of interdicting the movement of arms and supplies from the South China Sea into South Vietnam by Viet Cong and North Vietnam junk and trawler operators . The squadron also provided naval gunfire support to nearby friendly units operating along the South Vietnamese coastline and assisted the U.S. Navy during Operation Sealords . As the United States ' direct involvement in combat operations wound down during 1969 , squadron crews began training Republic of Vietnam Navy ( RVN ) sailors in the operation and deployment of the cutters . The cutters were later turned over to the RVN as part of the Vietnamization of the war effort . Turnover of the cutters to South Vietnamese Navy crews began in May 1969 and was completed by August 1970 . Squadron One was disestablished with the decommissioning of the last cutter . 
 The squadron was awarded several unit citations for its service to the U.S. Navy and the South Vietnamese government during the six years the unit was active with over 3 @,@ 000 Coast Guardsmen serving aboard cutters and on the squadron support staff . Six squadron members were killed in action during the time the unit was commissioned . 
 Squadron One , along with American and South Vietnamese naval units assigned to the task force that assumed the Market Time mission , were successful interdicting seaborne North Vietnamese personnel and equipment from entering South Vietnamese waters . The success of the blockade served to change the dynamics of the Vietnam War , forcing the North Vietnamese to use a more costly and time @-@ consuming route down the Ho Chi Minh trail to supply their forces in the south . 
 = = Background = = 
 As the United States military involvement in South Vietnam shifted from an advisory role to combat operations , advisors from Military Assistance Command , Vietnam ( MACV ) to the South Vietnamese military noticed an increase in the amount of military supplies and weapons being smuggled into the country by way of North Vietnamese junks and other small craft . The extent of infiltration was underscored in February 1965 when a U.S. Army helicopter crew spotted a North Vietnamese trawler camouflaged to look like an island . The event would later be known as the Vung Ro Bay Incident , named for the small bay that was the trawler 's destination . After the U.S. Army helicopter crew called in air strikes on the trawler , it was sunk and captured after a five @-@ day action conducted by elements of the Republic of Vietnam Navy ( RVN ) . Investigators found one million rounds of small arms ammunition , more than 1 @,@ 000 stick grenades , 500 pounds of prepared TNT charges , 2 @,@ 000 rounds of 82 mm mortar ammunition , 500 anti @-@ tank grenades , 1 @,@ 500 rounds of recoilless rifle ammunition , 3 @,@ 600 rifles and sub @-@ machine guns , and 500 pounds of medical supplies . Labels on captured equipment and supplies and other papers found in the wreckage indicated that the shipment was from North Vietnam . Concern by top MACV advisors as to whether the RVN was up to the task of interdicting shipments originating in North Vietnam led to a request by General William C. Westmoreland , commanding general of MACV , for U.S. Navy assistance . 
 The request was initially filled by U.S. Navy radar picket destroyer escorts ( DER ) and minesweepers ( <unk> ) in March when Operation Market Time was started , but these vessels had too great a draft to operate effectively in shallow coastal waters . In April the U.S. Navy ordered 54 Swift boats ( PCF ) , 50 @-@ foot ( 15 m ) aluminum @-@ hulled boats with a draft of only 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) and capable of 25 knots ( 29 mph ; 46 km / h ) . At the same time , the U.S. Navy queried the Treasury Department , the lead agency for the U.S. Coast Guard at the time , about the availability of suitable vessels . The Coast Guard had only a very minor role in combat operations during the Korean War and the Commandant of the Coast Guard , Admiral Edwin J. Roland , responded to the request by offering the use of 82 @-@ foot ( 25 m ) Point @-@ class cutters ( WPB ) and 40 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) utility boats , fearing that , if the Coast Guard were left out of a role in Vietnam , its status as one of the nation 's armed services might be jeopardized . 
 The decision to use the Point @-@ class cutter was one of logistics . The 95 @-@ foot ( 29 m ) Cape @-@ class cutter was initially considered an option by Roland since it had a greater speed because of its four main drive engines . The Point @-@ class cutter had only two main drive engines but they were more consistent throughout the class than the Cape @-@ class cutters , so it was easier to supply spare parts and maintain the engines . Additional factors favoring the Point @-@ class cutter were an unmanned engine room with all controls and alarms on the bridge , and air @-@ conditioned living spaces , a big factor in a tropical climate where crews were expected to live on the boat whether on or off duty . The 40 @-@ foot utility boats were rejected because they lacked radar , berthing , and mess facilities for extended patrols offshore . 
 On 22 April representatives of the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Navy signed a memorandum of understanding stating that the Coast Guard would supply 17 Point @-@ class cutters and their crews and the Navy would provide transport to South Vietnam and logistical support with two tank landing ships ( LST ) that had been converted to repair ships . Ten of the cutters were sourced from stations on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and seven were sourced from Pacific coast stations . After removal of the Oerlikon 20 – mm cannon on the bow , in place of which each cutter was fitted with a combination mount consisting of a 81 mm mortar which could be either drop @-@ fired or trigger @-@ fired , above which was mounted a .50 caliber M2 Browning machine gun . The mortar could be fired in both indirect and direct modes , and was equipped with a recoil cylinder . The cutters were loaded on merchant ships for shipment to U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay in the Philippines . On 29 April President Lyndon B. Johnson authorized Coast Guard units to operate under Navy command in Vietnam and to provide surveillance and interdiction assistance to U.S. Navy vessels and aircraft in an effort to stop the infiltration of troops , weapons and ammunition into South Vietnam by North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ) and Viet Cong ( VC ) forces . 
 = = Crew training and unit commissioning = = 
 While the cutters were being shipped to Subic Bay , crew members started reporting to Coast Guard Training Center Alameda , California on 17 May 1965 for overseas processing and training . The cutter crews received one week of small arms training at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado and Camp Pendleton while Survival , Evasion , Resistance and Escape ( <unk> ) training was received at Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center , near Coleville , California , in the Sierra Nevada Mountains and at Whidbey Island Naval Air Station , Washington . Returning to Alameda , they underwent refresher firefighting and damage control training from the Navy at Treasure Island Naval Base . Additional weapons qualifications and live fire exercises were held at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks , California , along with refresher training in radar navigation , radio procedures and visual signaling . Gun crews received mortar and machine gun training at Camp Pendleton . Of the 245 personnel assigned to the unit only 131 were present at the squadron commissioning ceremony held at Alameda on 27 May with the remainder of the crews in the process of completing training elsewhere . For service in Vietnam , two officers were added to the normal crew complement of eight to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea . All officers assigned to command cutters were required to be lieutenants and to have previously commanded a Cape @-@ class cutter and had to volunteer for the assignment . The executive officer was either a lieutenant junior grade or ensign . 
 = = Naval Base Subic Bay = = 
 = = = Divisions 11 and 12 = = = 
 The first crews arrived at Subic Bay on 11 June and a squadron office was established . On 12 June 1965 , the squadron came under the operational control of the commander , Vietnam Patrol Force ( CTF 71 ) . Administrative control for personnel actions such as pay and personnel records was retained by the Coast Guard . The first cutters arrived at Subic Bay on 17 June and before they were put in the water each hull bottom was inspected , repaired if necessary and painted from the waterline down . Mechanical , ordnance , electrical and electronic maintenance checks were completed before any modifications for duty in Vietnam were attempted . Modifications completed at Subic Bay included new radio transceivers , fabrication of gunner 's platforms and ammunition ready boxes for the mortar , the addition of floodlights for night boardings , installation of small arms lockers on the mess deck and addition of sound @-@ powered telephone circuits . Additional bunks and refrigerators were added to increase patrol on @-@ station time . Modifications were made to the bow @-@ mounted over @-@ under machine gun mortar combination allowing it to be depressed below the horizon for close @-@ range firing . Four additional M @-@ 2 machine guns with ready boxes were added to the gunwales of each cutter . 
 As the crews arrived from the United States , they began doing required modification work in the shipyard and shakedown sorties in an effort to get all systems working . Night training exercises and gunnery drills were held each day and underway drills and training had been completed and commissary stores loaded by 9 July . A one @-@ day survival training course was conducted by Negrito natives and completion was compulsory for all squadron personnel . When it became known that the cutters would be operating in two widely separated locations , Squadron One was divided into two divisions with Division 11 operating in the Gulf of Thailand at An Thoi , Phu Quoc Island and Division 12 operating near the port of Da Nang close to the Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) . Division 11 consisted of nine cutters and Division 12 consisted of eight cutters . At 16 : 00 on 16 July , Division 12 got underway and once out of the harbor they formed up on USS Snohomish County , the LST permanently assigned to support the division at Da Nang . Division 11 and USS Floyd County , the division 's LST support ship , left Subic Bay bound for Phu Quoc Island at 08 : 00 on 24 July 
 = = = Division 13 = = = 
 After reviewing a study of the overall infiltration threat , MACV requested additional aircraft and patrol vessels for Operation Market Time . A request for an additional division of Point @-@ class cutters to be added to Squadron One was made on 5 August 1965 and preparations for deploying the additional cutters started in late October with the new division of nine patrol boats to be named Division 13 . The staff and repair personnel arrived at Subic Bay 14 December 1965 while the division 's boat crews received weapons and undertook survival training in California . The crews started arriving at Subic Bay on 28 December where additional survival and weapons training was given . Twenty @-@ one of the division 's personnel were sent to Divisions 11 and 12 to be exchanged for crewmen who had Market Time experience . Division 13 cutters began arriving as deck cargo on transport ships at Subic Bay on 24 January 1966 and crews commenced outfitting and painting them deck gray . Some of the outfitting had been accomplished before shipment so that more time could be devoted to training crews in gunnery and procedure before the division 's scheduled departure for Vietnam on 18 February . During a training exercise on 13 February , the main engine alarm sounded on the bridge of Point League . After checking the cause of the alarm , it was determined that a complete overhaul of one of the engines would be required . Division 12 shipped a complete kit of repair parts from Da Nang overnight by way of a U.S. Marine Corps C @-@ 130 flight to <unk> Point Naval Air Station . The flight was met by division personnel and repairs commenced . Divided into three shifts , the crews worked around @-@ the @-@ clock and the repairs were completed in 72 hours . A partial load break @-@ in was made the morning of departure and the rest of the procedure was completed while the division was en route to Vietnam . At 16 : 00 on 18 February , Division 13 left Subic Bay in the company of USS Forster , arriving at the RVN Base at Cat Lo on 22 February . Patrol work for six of the division 's cutters began at 08 : 00 the following morning , covering the area from 60 miles ( 97 km ) north of Vung Tau to 120 miles ( 193 km ) south .

 = = = Arrival in South Vietnam = = = 
 Division 12 arrived at the port city of Da Nang at 07 : 00 on 20 July 1965 and was the first U.S. Coast Guard unit to be stationed in South Vietnam . The morning after their arrival five of the division 's eight cutters prepared to get underway for their first patrol accompanied by the Navy destroyer USS Savage , which coordinated the Market Time assets in the Da Nang area . 
 Division 11 arrived at Con Son Island on 29 July taking shelter from heavy seas and monsoon rains that had developed during the transit . Point Banks was the only cutter to have engine problems during the transit and repairs were made in the cramped engine room while underway so that no time was lost by the division during transit . During the lay over at Con Son minor repairs were made and repainting was completed on some of the cutters ' hulls which had been partially stripped of paint by the storm . Three RVN liaison officers reported aboard the cutters just before the division departed for Phu Quoc Island and the same three cutters started patrol work as the rest of the division put into Phu Quoc harbor on 31 July . On 30 July operational control of all Market Time elements , whether U.S. Navy , U.S. Coast Guard or RVN , was transferred to the Commander , Task Force 115 ( TF115 ) . 
 = = = Market Time operational theory = = = 
 Market Time planners sectioned off nine patrol areas numbered in order from the DMZ in the north to the Cambodian border in the south . The areas varied in size , measuring 80 by 120 miles ( 130 km × 190 km ) wide and running 30 to 40 miles ( 48 to 64 km ) out to sea . The outer two @-@ thirds of each area was covered by the U.S. Navy DER and <unk> fleet and was identified by the area number with the suffix " B " . After May 1967 high endurance cutters ( <unk> ) from Coast Guard Squadron Three also assisted in the outer patrol areas . Because the inner third of each patrol area was usually shallow water it was covered by Navy PCFs and Coast Guard WPBs which had shallow drafts . These smaller patrol areas were identified by a letter " C " or higher . Thus , the patrol area covering the waters near Cam Ranh Bay would have the outer two @-@ thirds designated " 4B " and the waters nearer shore designated " 4C " through " 4H " . <unk> the whole area were Navy patrol aircraft that flew various assigned tracks , reporting any traffic to <unk> stationed at five Coastal Surveillance Centers ( CSC ) operated jointly by the U.S. Navy and RVN . Reports of movements by suspicious vessels were relayed to the nearest Market Time patrol craft whose duty it was to board and search for contraband material and persons on board without proper identification . The rules of engagement that Market Time forces operated under allowed any vessel except warships to be stopped , boarded and searched within three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) of the coastline and from the area three miles to twelve miles ( 19 @.@ 4 km ) from shore , identification and a declaration of intent could be demanded of any vessel except a warship . Outside the twelve @-@ mile limit only vessels of South Vietnamese origin could be stopped , boarded and searched . 
 While on patrol the cutters operated under orders from an operational commander at the CSC and not the division commander to which they were assigned . The division was responsible for seeing that each cutter was ready to perform her assignments and properly supplied with trained personnel , supplies and equipment . Each division 's staff performed regular readiness reviews on each assigned cutter ; riding with the crews to judge their effectiveness . 
 On 30 September 1968 , Vice Admiral Elmo Zumwalt assumed command of Naval Forces Vietnam and he redirected the focus of interdiction operations conducted by TF115 to areas nearer the DMZ as a part of Operation Sealords ( Southeast Asia Lake , Ocean , River , and Delta Strategy ) . The result was that all but four Division 11 WPBs were transferred to Divisions 12 and 13 and the shallower draft U.S. Navy PCFs that had been used for patrol duties at the DMZ were used to patrol the canals and rivers .

 Soon after patrol operations started in Division 12 's area of responsibility ( AOR ) , Point Orient encountered machine gun and mortar fire from the shore south of the Cua Viet River while attempting to board a junk in the early morning hours of 24 July 1965 . The Point Orient returned fire , and in doing so it became the first Coast Guard unit in Vietnam to engage the enemy . As a result of the incident , it became obvious to the skipper of the Point Orient that the paint scheme used by the Coast Guard in the U.S. was too visible at night and shortly thereafter the white paint was replaced by deck gray on all WPBs in Squadron One . On assuming control , the TF115 commander changed the way patrols were conducted in the DMZ . Future patrols were concentrated along the DMZ for most of the WPBs and PCFs with only a few assets placed in the Da Nang area . Assets were concentrated where vessel traffic was encountered ; most traffic near the Da Nang area was interdicted further out to sea by the <unk> and <unk> and fewer shallow draft assets were needed there . 
 19 September was a busy day for Division 11 in the Gulf of Thailand with Point Glover encountering a junk that fired on her and when unable to escape tried to ram the cutter . The Viet Cong crew jumped overboard and Point Glover disabled the junk 's engine with machine gun fire . A boarding party from Point Glover boarded the sinking junk and did a quick search of the vessel , finding arms and ammunition . Unable to stop the junk from sinking , she was beached in shallow water while Point Garnet , Point Clear and Point Marone went searching for the missing junk crew ; however , only one crew member was captured . Later that night Point Marone attempted to stop an unlit junk near the coastal town of Ha Tien but the junk ignored a warning shot across her bow and attempted to evade boarding while firing at the cutter and throwing hand grenades . Point Glover was nearby and assisted Point Marone in engaging the junk with machine gun fire . The junk caught fire and started sinking . Unable to keep the junk afloat the cutter crews marked it with a buoy and let it sink in shallow water . Salvage operations conducted later found rifles , ammunition , hand grenades , documents and money . Eleven Viet Cong were killed in the action and one badly wounded crewman was captured ashore .

 After Division 13 's arrival at Cat Lo on 22 February 1966 , operations started at nearby Rung Sat Special Zone ; an area of tidal mangrove swamp southeast of Saigon that straddled the Long Tau River , the main shipping channel to the Port of Saigon . Point White was patrolling on the night of 9 March and intercepted a small junk attempting to smuggle supplies across the <unk> <unk> River . After hailing the junk and receiving automatic weapons fire in reply , the cutter returned fire and killed several Viet Cong . They continued to fire on Point White so the skipper ordered the helmsman to ram the junk amidships at full speed . All but four of the crew of the junk were killed . One of the survivors turned out to be a key leader in the Viet Cong Rung Sat infrastructure . On 15 March Point Partridge engaged and damaged another junk , but shallow water allowed the junk to escape . On 22 March Point Hudson drew fire from another junk on the river . In the battle that followed , an estimated ten Viet Cong were killed . In conjunction with a joint U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps operation designated Operation <unk> , several Division 13 cutters were ordered to patrol the lower portion of the Soi Rap River in an effort to deny food , water , and ammunition to the Viet Cong operating in the Rung Sat Special Zone . From the start of patrols on 10 March until the ships of the amphibious ready group put the Marines ashore on the Long Thành peninsula on 26 March , Division 13 cutters had taken fire from the shore almost every night during patrol operations . Some of the most intense combat operations that Squadron One encountered occurred during the month of March 1966 in support of Operation <unk> . The joint operation ended 6 April with the withdrawal of the Marine Amphibious Force but the skipper of Point Partridge decided to continue the patrols after the operation ended . On the night patrols from 1 to 6 May Point Partridge engaged Viet Cong junks or received fire from the shore every night . 
 While patrolling off the coast of the Ca Mau Peninsula in the late evening hours of 9 May 1966 Point Grey reported sighting two large bonfires on the shore near the mouth of the <unk> Gia River . Since this was an unusual activity the skipper decided to monitor the area for the remainder of the night . Shortly after midnight , a steel @-@ hulled trawler was spotted and challenged but Point Grey received no answer . The trawler continued on a course headed for the beach area near the bonfires and ran aground 400 yards ( 370 m ) from the shore . After daybreak Point Grey attempted to board the trawler but encountered heavy fire from the shore . After requesting assistance from the CSC , Point Grey stood off from the trawler until destroyer escort USS Brister arrived on scene . With Brister standing in deeper water and South Vietnamese Air Force A @-@ 1E Skyraider aircraft bombing the beach nearby , Point Grey attempted a boarding but she received very heavy small arms fire from Viet Cong positions beyond the beach which heavily damaged the bridge and wounded three of her crew manning the mortar on the bow . With evening approaching it was decided by CSC to destroy the trawler and Point Grey assisted by Point Cypress began mortaring the trawler . During the shelling an explosion on board the trawler broke it in two pieces and caused it to sink in the shallow waters . Salvage operations began the next morning and included the recovery of six crew served weapons and 15 short tons ( 14 @,@ 000 kg ) of ammunition of Chinese manufacture . The destruction of the trawler marked the first instance of the capture of a trawler by Market Time assets . 
 While on patrol near the mouth of the Co Chien River in the early hours of 20 June , the skipper of Point League noted a large radar contact which , upon further investigation , was found to be running without navigation lights . After informing the CSC of the situation the cutter went to general quarters and spotlighted the incoming trawler . The trawler ignored a hail from Point League and two bursts of machine gun fire across its bow . The trawler returned with heavy machine gun fire hitting the cutter 's bridge and wounding the executive officer and a crewman manning the mortar on the forecastle . The trawler dropped the line on a towed junk and picked up speed in an effort to beach along the shore . When the commanding officer of Point League noticed that the trawler was headed for shoal water near the mouth of the river , he let the trawler run aground 75 yards ( 69 m ) from shore and moved to a position 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) away while keeping the target illuminated with mortar rounds . Point League then came under fire from Viet Cong elements operating from just behind the shoreline . With assistance from Point Slocum the two cutters poured machine gun fire into the grounded trawler . Just after dawn the trawler was sunk by what was probably a scuttling charge resulting in a large fire . At 07 : 15 destroyer escort USS Haverfield arrived on scene and assumed control of the operation . With the assistance of two U.S. Air Force F @-@ 100 Super Sabre aircraft providing close air support , resistance from the shoreline was finally controlled . It was decided by the commanding officer of the Haverfield that salvage of the trawler would be attempted in order to learn more about the trawler , its origins and the cargo on board . The crews of the two cutters were joined by Point Hudson and dock landing ship USS Tortuga and several RVN junks in fighting the fire and beginning salvage operations . After patching the hull and dewatering ; the trawler was eventually towed to the RVN shipyard at Vung Tau . The 99 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) trawler yielded valuable information about the capabilities of that particular class of trawler . It was carrying about 100 short tons ( 91 @,@ 000 kg ) of small arms and ammunition of recent manufacture in China and North Korea . The surviving log and navigation charts helped determine the trawler 's origin and two possible destinations . 
 = = = = = Point Welcome incident = = = = = 
 Point Welcome was patrolling Area 1A1 immediately south of the DMZ in the early morning hours of 11 August 1966 . At 03 : 40 the cutter was illuminated by an U.S. Air Force forward air controller ( FAC ) who mistook her for an enemy vessel . The FAC called in one B @-@ 57 Canberra tactical bomber and two F @-@ 4 Phantom fighter @-@ bomber aircraft which proceeded to strafe the cutter for about one hour , each making from seven to nine passes . Point Welcome turned on all of her running and docking lights when first illuminated by the FAC aircraft and contacted the CSC by radio telling them that they were being illuminated by aircraft . During the first pass all of the crew on the bridge were wounded and the commanding officer , Lieutenant Junior Grade David Brostrom , was killed along with the helmsman , Engineman Second Class Jerry Phillips . All signaling equipment , electronics and radios were knocked out on the first pass . Point Welcome began evasive maneuvers at the direction of Chief Boatswains Mate Richard Patterson , who had assumed command after the executive officer was seriously injured . Patterson attempted to avoid the illumination lights of the attacking aircraft and move out of the way of the strafing aircraft . At 04 : 15 Patterson decided that the best course of action was to beach the cutter and move the wounded ashore , however when this was attempted , the crew came under fire from unknown sources from the shoreline . At 04 : 25 Point Orient and Point Caution arrived on the scene and started rescue proceedings . In addition to the commanding officer , one other crewman was killed , nine other crewmen were injured along with a RVN liaison officer and civilian freelance journalist Tim Page . The bridge of the cutter was severely damaged and despite nine 5 to 9 inch ( 13 to 23 cm ) wide holes in the main deck , the hull was undamaged . Point Welcome was escorted back to Da Nang under her own power and required three months to repair the damage . Patterson saved the cutter and the surviving crew at great risk to himself . He was awarded a Bronze Star with the combat " V " device for his actions . 
 After eight days of testimony the findings of a board of investigation conducted by MACV were forwarded to the Commandant of the Coast Guard : 
 As a result of the investigation , lines of communication were set up between the Navy and the Air Force . The Air Force knew nothing of Operation Market Time and did not routinely communicate with Naval Forces , Vietnam . To avoid a repetition of the incident , aircraft patrolling near the DMZ were instructed not to attack vessels without first contacting CSC Da Nang for clearance .

 In the late evening hours of 1 January 1967 Point Gammon along with two U.S. Navy vessels , PCF @-@ 68 and PCF @-@ 71 , intercepted a trawler attempting to land supplies on the Cau Mau Peninsula . After running the trawler aground the PCFs managed to hit it with several mortar rounds while Point Gammon kept the trawler illuminated . Several secondary explosions occurred and the trawler disappeared . Investigations later concluded that the trawler could have successfully escaped to a nearby river although heavily damaged . 
 A more successful action was fought in the early morning hours of 14 March 1967 when a U.S. Navy patrol aircraft spotted a trawler near Cu @-@ Lao Re , an island 65 miles ( 105 km ) southeast of Da Nang . USS Brister and two PCFs along with Point Ellis closed on the trawler and forced it aground near the village of Phouc Thien on Cape Batangan . The patrol elements continued to exchange heavy gunfire with the trawler and land @-@ based Viet Cong units until dawn when the trawler was scuttled with a massive explosion . Investigators later discovered a heavy machine gun , a recoilless rifle , sub @-@ machine guns , rifles and carbines along with thousands of rounds of ammunition . Also in the wreckage was a complete surgical kit for a field hospital and medical supplies . 
 A similar conclusion was the result of the capture of a steel hull trawler 15 July 1967 after three days of tracking by patrol aircraft and the radar picket , USS <unk> . After playing a cat @-@ and @-@ mouse game for three days with TF115 units the trawler headed for the mouth of the Sa Ky River on the Batangan Peninsula late on 14 July . The trawler was directed by Point Orient to heave to , but the hail was answered with gunfire . The cutter returned fire along with <unk> and gunboat USS Gallup , destroyer USS Walker , and PCF @-@ 79 . At 02 : 00 on 15 July , the trawler was boxed in and ablaze , and ran aground 200 yards ( 180 m ) from shore . South Korean marines directed artillery fire from the shore and at 06 : 00 with the trawler apparently abandoned , a U.S. Navy demolitions expert from Walker boarded the trawler and defused 2 @,@ 000 pounds of TNT charges that were designed to scuttle the craft . Found on board were several thousand rounds of rifle and machine gun ammunition , mortar and rocket rounds , anti @-@ personnel mines , grenades , and several thousand pounds of C @-@ 4 plastic explosive and TNT . Weapons found included several hundred machine guns , AK @-@ 47 rifles , AK @-@ 56 rifles , and B @-@ 40 rocket launchers . 
 On many occasions during the months of October , November and December 1967 , the cutters Point Hudson , Point Jefferson , Point Grace and Point Gammon were called on to assist in naval gunfire support missions in the Long Toan and Thanh Phu Secret Zones near Soc Trang . These missions resulted in the destruction of several sampans and structures as well as bunkers used by the Viet Cong .

 During the morning hours of 31 January 1968 , combined forces of North Vietnamese Army / Viet Cong personnel initiated coordinated attacks on military installations throughout South Vietnam in what would be later be referred to as the Tet Offensive . Because of monsoon weather in the northern provinces of South Vietnam and a general curfew imposed by South Vietnam on most sampan traffic , routine boardings by Squadron One vessels during February were far below normal . However , requests for naval gunfire support by land @-@ based U.S. Army and U.S. Marine units increased significantly after Tet . The cutters Point Gammon , Point Arden , Point Grey , Point Cypress , Point League , and Point Slocum were involved in multiple naval gunfire support missions throughout the month of February . The use of Squadron One cutters as a blocking force against exfiltration by NVA / VC forces operating along the coastline also increased at this time . 
 During an action on 1 March 1968 , in the early morning several Squadron One cutters were involved in the interdiction and destruction of four North Vietnamese trawlers attempting to smuggle arms and ammunition into South Vietnam at different locations . This co @-@ ordinated attempt by the North Vietnamese was met by various elements of TF115 ; including U.S. Navy aircraft and vessels , RVN junks , U.S. Air Force aircraft , and U.S. Army helicopters . In addition , there were several Owasco @-@ class cutter cutters from Coast Guard Squadron Three – Androscoggin , Winona , and Minnetonka – as well as Point Grey , Point Hudson , and Point Welcome from Squadron One . As a result of this action , three North Vietnamese trawlers were destroyed and a fourth was turned back before it could reach the coast . After this action the incidence of smuggling by trawler was decreased and Communist forces had to resort to shipments along the Ho Chi Minh trail or through the port of Sihanoukville in Cambodia . 
 While on patrol just south of the DMZ in the early morning hours of 16 June 1968 Point Dume reported seeing two rockets fired from an unidentified source hit U.S. Navy PCF @-@ 19 , which sank very quickly with the loss of five crew . Shortly thereafter , Point Dume came under fire from an unidentified aircraft along with the heavy cruiser USS Boston and the Royal Australian Navy destroyer HMAS Hobart . The duration of the attack was about one hour with little damage to the cutter and Boston but considerable damage to Hobart with two sailors killed and eight wounded . Evidence during a board of inquiry later showed that it was a friendly fire incident involving U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy aircraft mistaking the ships for enemy targets . This incident and the 11 August 1966 friendly fire incident involving Point Welcome caused several procedures for the identification of naval vessels by U.S. Navy , U.S. Marine and U.S. Air Force aircrews to change . 
 Operations conducted by South Vietnamese Regional Force troops on Phu Quoc Island in September were assisted by Market Time assets . Point Partridge and Point Banks assisted with naval gunfire support on 9 September which destroyed three bunkers , killing four and wounding several others . Ten Viet Cong were captured . On 20 September , Point Cypress and RVN MSC @-@ 116 assisted Regional Forces troops that had been ambushed by Viet Cong forces by lending naval gunfire support . Point Hudson , Point Kennedy , and U.S. Navy PCF @-@ 50 and PCF @-@ 3 arrived shortly after the action started and joined in the gunfire support . Small boats from the cutters helped evacuate wounded Regional Force troops . 
 Heavy weather in the form of monsoons in the northern half of South Vietnam reduced indigenous coastal traffic during October 1968 and the U.S. Navy 's PCF support of Market Time was limited by heavy seas ; however , Market Time units including Squadron One cutters fired a record number of naval gunfire missions for the sixth month in a row . The 1 @,@ 027 missions conducted during October was 19 percent higher than the previous record . 
 On 5 December 1968 , three crewmen operating the small boat from Point Cypress in a small stream on the Ca Mau Peninsula were ambushed , severely wounding two and killing the third , Fireman Heriberto S. Hernandez . Zumwalt awarded a Bronze Star Medal with " V " Device posthumously to Hernandez for his heroic actions in saving his fellow crewmen 's lives .

 In February 1969 , Squadron One personnel began training RVN engineers in the maintenance and repair of the Point class cutters that would eventually be turned over to the South Vietnamese government under the " Vietnamization " program . 
 On 22 March during routine operations involving the inspection of fishing craft for contraband arms and supplies , the chief engineer , Chief Engineman Morris S. Beeson of the Point Orient was killed by ambush fire from three shore positions while attempting to board a sampan near Qui Nhon . 
 On 27 March , Point Dume was notified by a unit of the U.S. Army 's 173rd Airborne Brigade that a Viet Cong unit was located at a village 40 miles ( 64 km ) north of Qui Nhon and Point Dume was requested to perform a blocking patrol while the brigade 's troops conducted a sweep . Point Dume assisted with naval gunfire support . Additionally , in the aftermath , a landing party helped to destroy 41 sampans that had been used to transport Viet Cong supplies . 
 The first turnover of Squadron One cutters occurred on 16 May with the transfer of Point League and Point Garnet to the South Vietnamese Navy under the Vietnamization plan . An elaborate ceremony was held at the RVN Base in Saigon with dignitaries from many area naval activities witnessing the turnover of the two cutters . On 5 June , Division 11 was disestablished and its cutters were transferred to Division 13 . The need for Squadron One cutters had been supplanted by the shallower draft PCFs and <unk> that were being concentrated in the Delta region for use in Operation Sealords . With better foul weather <unk> abilities than the U.S. Navy craft , the Point @-@ class cutters of the Squadron were shifted for use during the northeast monsoon season in the northern half of the country . 
 On 9 August while conducting a harassment and interdiction mission aboard Point Arden , a misfire occurred with the mortar killing Lieutenant Junior Grade Michael W. Kirkpatrick , the cutter 's executive officer , and Engineman First Class Michael H. Painter . 
 = = 1970 – Vietnamization and disestablishment = = 
 With the growing dissatisfaction of the American electorate about Vietnam in 1969 , high officials in the Nixon Administration sought a way to disengage the United States from the war . Part of the strategy to placate public opinion was termed " Vietnamization " and it included plans to remove most U.S. combat troops from Vietnam and the turnover of supplies and equipment to the South Vietnamese military . Other parts of the plan , referred to as Accelerated Turnover to Vietnamese ( ACTOV ) , included the training of Vietnamese in the use of equipment that was to be turned over to them and a gradual phase @-@ in of responsibilities for the conduct of the war by the South Vietnamese government . The first assets turned over to the Vietnamese under ACTOV occurred on 1 February 1969 when 25 mostly smaller U.S. Navy vessels were transferred to the RVN to be used in supporting Operation Sealords in the Mekong Delta .

 The naval assets portion of the ACTOV plan consisted of two parts : SCATTOR ( Small Craft Assets , Training , and Turnover of Resources ) and VECTOR ( Vietnamese Engineering Capability , Training of Ratings ) . While SCATTOR trained Vietnamese replacement crews for the patrol boats of Squadron One , VECTOR trained and prepared Vietnamese repair personnel to maintain them . 
 = = = = Background = = = = 
 Since the patrol boats of Squadron One were an essential part of the blockade of war supplies entering South Vietnam from North Vietnam , it was decided that they would be transferred to the South Vietnamese navy after crews had been trained to operate them effectively . On 2 November 1968 , Zumwalt , Commander , Naval Forces Vietnam , presented a plan to General Creighton W. Abrams , Commander , MACV to turn over all U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard resources to the RVN by 30 June 1970 . Abrams approved the Navy 's plan with the caveat that any equipment turned over to the Vietnamese would have to be in first @-@ class condition and that they would have to be properly trained in its use . The Navy plan called for the enlisted Vietnamese personnel to report aboard vessels for training first with the officers finally reporting aboard after the crews were trained . In a recommendation made 14 January 1969 , the Commander , Coast Guard Activities Vietnam , Captain Ralph W. <unk> , suggested that English speaking Vietnamese officers report aboard first and be given the chance to receive extensive procedural training with Coast Guard crews before any junior personnel report aboard . <unk> cited cultural imperatives that required seniors to be more knowledgeable than subordinates and that it would be very difficult for officers to accept instruction from junior personnel without losing face . Zumwalt agreed with the Coast Guard plan enthusiastically and ordered it implemented immediately . 
 On 3 February 1969 the first RVN officers reported aboard Point Garnet and Point League for an 18 @-@ week pilot training program . Each cutter 's executive officer was relieved and assigned staff duties ashore with the commanding officer assuming his duties . The two spare bunks on each cutter were utilized by the new Vietnamese personnel reporting on board . As experience was gained by the Vietnamese crew members , new junior personnel reported in pairs replacing Coast Guardsmen that were then assigned ashore to assist with the VECTOR phase of training . The first transfer of Squadron One cutters occurred at the RVN Base in Saigon during joint decommissioning and commissioning ceremonies held 16 May 1969 by the Coast Guard and the RVN . Point Garnet and Point League were the first cutters transferred under the ACTOV plan . 
 = = = = Problems = = = = 
 SCATTOR training was not easy for either the trainers or the trainees . Cultural differences and language barriers had to be breached by both . English – Vietnamese dictionaries were used extensively and Vietnamese sailors who spoke even broken English were often pressed into service to help translate the training syllabus for each job on the cutter . Coast Guardsmen that had maintained their cutters with pride could not understand the Vietnamese sailors seeming lack of care about housekeeping chores . Orders dictated that any cutter entering the ACTOV Program had to be ready for turnover within four months . Often after a return from patrol duties the Vietnamese sailors would just leave the cutter as soon as it reached homeport , leaving maintenance , cleanup , and re @-@ provisioning to the Coast Guardsmen . AWOL rates for Vietnamese sailors often interfered with training schedules as well as patrol operations . Morale of the Coast Guardsmen charged with the training of the replacement Vietnamese crew was often very low and this caused friction between the two parts of the crew . Because of political pressures in the United States to end involvement in the war as soon as possible , the SCATTOR program of training was accelerated to a 15 @-@ week program and eventually an 11 @-@ week program . This caused overcrowding on the cutters and further problems with the mixed crews . 
 All of the Squadron One cutters eventually completed training of the Vietnamese crews and as cutters were transferred to the RVN each division shrunk in size until they were consolidated with other divisions . Division 11 was disestablished on 5 June 1969 with the remaining cutters in the division moving to Cat Lo . Division 12 was consolidated with Division 13 at Cat Lo 16 March 1970 .

 After Point Grey and Point Orient were turned over to the RVN on 14 July only Point Cypress and Point Marone were left in Division 13 . On that day the remaining two cutters were given orders to report to the lower Mekong Delta and provide support for operations in the Than Phu Secret Zone . On 19 and 20 July the crews of both cutters consisted of a full complement of 13 RVN sailors and 5 Coast Guardsmen including the commanding officers . Kit Carson Scouts were also embarked , making the decks very crowded . The Scouts were put ashore on a search and destroy mission and the cutters backed them up with gunfire from their decks and the cutter small boats . The raid was successful , netting several captured Viet Cong troops and boxes of documents . A week later both cutters with Australian Army explosive ordnance disposal soldiers aboard cruised the My Thanh River and destroyed fortifications . 
 On 4 August 1970 , coincidentally Coast Guard Day , the pair of cutters set out on what would prove to be their last combat patrol . Each cutter had 25 Kit Carson Scouts embarked for a patrol of the Co Chien River . While following a narrow canal leading off the main channel , Point Marone was the target of a command detonated mine . The blast killed two of the RVN sailors instantly ; all five Coast Guardsmen were injured along with 10 Kit Carson Scouts . After the mine explosion , Point Marone listed to starboard but managed to get underway while Point Cypress laid down suppressing fire and escorted the damaged cutter back to base at Cat Lo . Point Marone suffered three shrapnel holes at the starboard waterline as well as extensive damage to the bridge windows and damage to the watertight door between the mess deck and the forward berthing space . The deck aft of the bridge was covered with three inches of mud . After patching and painting , Point Marone was prepared for a final Operational Readiness Inspection to check the RVN crew readiness for the pending turnover of both Point Marone and Point Cypress . 
 = = = = Last turnover = = = = 
 With the turnover of Point Cypress and Point Marone to South Vietnamese navy on 15 August 1970 , Squadron One and its remaining division , Division 13 , were decommissioned . Over 3 @,@ 000 Coast Guardsmen had served with Squadron One in Vietnam since May 1965 . Administrative and liaison functions that had been carried out by the Squadron One staff were turned over to the Office of the Senior Coast Guard Officer , Vietnam ( <unk> ) . Several officers of Squadron One were assigned temporary duties as advisors to former Squadron One cutters to further assist the new RVN commanding officers in their new duties . The Coast Guard continued to provide technical assistance and training under the SCATTOR / VECTOR programs for the <unk> after Squadron One was disestablished through the formation of four Technical Assistance Groups . Each group was composed of an officer and eight to eleven engineers reporting to <unk> . The groups were located at Da Nang where there were six cutters assigned ; Cam Ranh Bay , six cutters ; Vung Tau , eight cutters ; and An Thoi , six cutters . As tours of duty for each Coast Guardsman ended , U.S. Navy personnel gradually took over the training duties . 
 = = Civic action = = 
 U.S. Coast Guard personnel stationed in Vietnam were encouraged by their commands to donate off duty time to assist in various civic action programs supporting the Vietnamese people . Squadron One personnel participated as time permitted in an island adoption program that was designed to provide educational materials and medical treatment to inhabitants of the many coastal islands in their area of operation . This program was offered to counter Viet Cong propaganda and promote a better understanding of the South Vietnamese government and USAID rural development programs . Since medical personnel were normally not a part of the make @-@ up of the Squadron One patrol boat crews , medical corpsmen were borrowed from Squadron Three cutters or nearby U.S. Navy units . Division 11 crews constructed a fresh water well and distribution system in addition to constructing voting booths on Hon Thom Island . Division 12 cutters helped evacuate refugees from the vicinity of Cape Batangan when military operations intensified during 1967 . Division 13 personnel spent many hours of off duty time at the children 's ward of the U.S. Army 36th <unk> Hospital and gave games , toys , clothing and candy to injured Vietnamese children . During the Christmas holidays , at local orphanages all squadron personnel distributed gifts of candy and toys as well as clothing , soap and toothpaste that had been donated by Coast Guard families in the United States and brought to Vietnam on the Commandant 's airplane . Squadron One crews arranged for transportation of a small girl by an U.S. Air Force helicopter to USS Sanctuary for eye surgery while the squadron commander personally delivered a cornea for transplant .

 The cutters of Squadron One made a significant contribution to the success of Operation Market Time by forcing the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces to rely on the difficult Ho Chi Minh trail for most of their supplies and reinforcements . During the period between 27 May 1965 and 15 August 1970 the squadron cruised 4 @,@ 215 @,@ 116 miles ( 6 @,@ 783 @,@ 572 km ) and boarded 236 @,@ 396 vessels while detaining 10 @,@ 286 persons .

 Presidential Unit Citation 
 The Presidential Unit Citation ( Navy ) was awarded for extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance to units participating in Operation Sealords for the period 18 October to 5 December 1968 and included the Squadron One cutters Point Cypress , Point White , Point Grace , Point Young , Point Comfort , Point Mast , Point Marone , Point Caution , and Point Partridge . 
 Navy Unit Commendation 
 The Navy Unit Commendation was awarded for exceptionally meritorious service to the United States Navy Coastal Surveillance Force ( Task Force 115 ) which included the administrative staff of Squadron One and Division 11 for service during period 1 January 1967 to 31 March 1968 ; Division 12 , 1 January to 28 February 1967 ; and Division 13 , 1 January to 10 May 1967 . 
 Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation 
 The Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation was awarded for meritorious service to units of the United States Navy Coastal Surveillance Force ( Task Force 115 ) which included the following Squadron One cutters : Point White , Point Arden , Point Dume , Point Glover , Point Jefferson , Point Kennedy , Point Young , Point Partridge , Point Caution , Point Welcome , Point Banks , Point Lomas , Point Grace , Point Mast , Point Grey , Point Orient , Point Cypress , and Point Marone . 
 Vietnam Service Medal 
 Although the Vietnam Service Medal is a personal service award , it is permissible and customary under Coast Guard regulations for cutters to display service awards on the port and starboard bridge wings . Squadron One cutters were entitled to display the VSM by virtue of having served in Vietnam for more than thirty days during the eligibility period of 15 November 1961 to 30 April 1975 . 
 Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation with Palm 
 All units serving under MACV were awarded the Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation with Palm by South Vietnam . Because U.S. Navy units serving in Vietnam were subordinate to MACV this included all Coast Guard Squadron One cutters . 
 Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal 
 The Vietnam Campaign Medal was an award of South Vietnam for those individuals who served in Vietnam for a period of at least six months . Although it was a personal award , Coast Guard regulations permitted its display on a cutter 's port and starboard bridge wings since Squadron One 's cutters served during the eligibility period of 1 March 1961 to 28 March 1973 .

 Tiktaalik / <unk> / is a monospecific genus of extinct sarcopterygian ( lobe @-@ finned fish ) from the late Devonian period , about 375 Ma ( million years ) ago , having many features akin to those of tetrapods ( four @-@ legged animals ) . 
 Tiktaalik has a possibility of being a representative of the evolutionary transition from fish to amphibians . It is an example from several lines of ancient sarcopterygian fish developing adaptations to the oxygen @-@ poor shallow @-@ water habitats of its time , environmental conditions which are thought to have led to the evolution of tetrapods . 
 It and similar animals may possibly be the common ancestors of the broad swath of all terrestrial fauna : amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals . The first well @-@ preserved Tiktaalik fossils were found in 2004 on Ellesmere Island in Nunavut , Canada . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name Tiktaalik is an Inuktitut word meaning " burbot " , a freshwater fish related to true cod . The " fishapod " genus received this name after a suggestion by Inuit elders of Canada 's Nunavut Territory , where the fossil was discovered . The specific name roseae cryptically honours an anonymous donor . Taking a detailed look at the internal head skeleton of Tiktaalik roseae , in the October 16 , 2008 , issue of Nature , researchers show how Tiktaalik was gaining structures that could allow it to support itself on solid ground and breathe air , a key intermediate step in the transformation of the skull that accompanied the shift to life on land by our distant ancestors . 
 = = Description = = 
 Tiktaalik provides insights on the features of the extinct closest relatives of the tetrapods . Unlike many previous , more fishlike transitional fossils , the " fins " of Tiktaalik have basic wrist bones and simple rays reminiscent of fingers . The homology of distal elements is uncertain ; there have been suggestions that they are homologous to digits , although this is incompatible with the digital arch developmental model because digits are supposed to be <unk> structures , and only three of the ( reconstructed ) eight rays of Tiktaalik are <unk> . 
 However , the proximal series can be directly compared to the ulnare and intermedium of tetrapods . The fin was clearly weight bearing , being attached to a massive shoulder with expanded scapular and coracoid elements and attached to the body armor , large muscular scars on the ventral surface of the humerus , and highly mobile distal joints . The bones of the <unk> show large muscle facets , suggesting that the fin was both muscular and had the ability to flex like a wrist joint . These wrist @-@ like features would have helped anchor the creature to the bottom in fast moving current . 
 Also notable are the spiracles on the top of the head , which suggest the creature had primitive lungs as well as gills . This attribute would have been useful in shallow water , where higher water temperature would lower oxygen content . This development may have led to the evolution of a more robust ribcage , a key evolutionary trait of land @-@ living creatures . The more robust ribcage of Tiktaalik would have helped support the animal ’ s body any time it ventured outside a fully aquatic habitat . Tiktaalik also lacked a characteristic that most fishes have — bony plates in the gill area that restrict lateral head movement . This makes Tiktaalik the earliest known fish to have a neck , with the pectoral girdle separate from the skull . This would give the creature more freedom in hunting prey either on land or in the shallows . 
 Tiktaalik is sometimes compared to gars ( esp . Atractosteus spatula , the alligator gar ) of the Lepisosteidae family , with whom it shares a number of characteristics : 
 diamond @-@ shaped scale patterns common to the <unk> class ( in both species scales are rhombic , overlapping and <unk> ) ; 
 teeth structured in two rows ; 
 both internal and external nostrils ; 
 tubular and streamlined body ; 
 absence of anterior dorsal fin ; 
 broad , dorsoventrally compressed skull ; 
 paired frontal bones ; 
 marginal nares ; 
 <unk> mouth ; 
 lung @-@ like organ . 
 = = Paleobiology = = 
 Tiktaalik generally had the characteristics of a lobe @-@ finned fish , but with front fins featuring arm @-@ like skeletal structures more akin to those of a crocodile , including a shoulder , elbow , and wrist . The fossil discovered in 2004 did not include the rear fins and tail . It had rows of sharp teeth of a predator fish , and its neck could move independently of its body , which is not common in other fish ( <unk> , <unk> , placoderms , and extant seahorses being some exceptions ; see also <unk> and <unk> <unk> ) . The animal had a flat skull resembling a crocodile 's ; eyes on top of its head , suggesting that it spent a lot of time looking up ; a neck and ribs similar to those of tetrapods , with the ribs being used to support its body and aid in breathing via lungs ; well developed jaws suitable for catching prey ; and a small gill slit called a spiracle that , in more derived animals , became an ear . 
 The fossils were found in the " Fram Formation " , deposits of meandering stream systems near the Devonian equator , suggesting a benthic animal that lived on the bottom of shallow waters and perhaps even out of the water for short periods , with a skeleton indicating that it could support its body under the force of gravity whether in very shallow water or on land . At that period , for the first time , deciduous plants were flourishing and annually shedding leaves into the water , attracting small prey into warm oxygen @-@ poor shallows that were difficult for larger fish to swim in . The discoverers said that in all likelihood , Tiktaalik flexed its proto @-@ limbs primarily on the floor of streams and may have pulled itself onto the shore for brief periods . In 2014 , the discovery of the animal 's pelvic girdle was announced ; it was strongly built , indicating the animal could have used them for moving in shallow water and across mudflats . Neil Shubin and Ted Daeschler , the leaders of the team , have been searching Ellesmere Island for fossils since 2000 
 We 're making the hypothesis that this animal was specialized for living in shallow stream systems , perhaps swampy habitats , perhaps even to some of the ponds . And maybe occasionally , using its very specialized fins , for moving up overland . And that 's what is particularly important here . The animal is developing features which will eventually allow animals to exploit land . 
 = = Classification and evolution = = 
 Tiktaalik roseae is the only species classified under the genus . Tiktaalik lived approximately 375 million years ago . Paleontologists suggest that it is representative of the transition between non @-@ tetrapod vertebrates ( fish ) such as Panderichthys , known from fossils 380 million years old , and early tetrapods such as Acanthostega and Ichthyostega , known from fossils about 365 million years old . Its mixture of primitive fish and derived tetrapod characteristics led one of its discoverers , Neil Shubin , to characterize Tiktaalik as a " fishapod " . 
 Tiktaalik is a transitional fossil ; it is to tetrapods what Aurornis is to birds , troodonts and dromaeosaurids . While it may be that neither is ancestor to any living animal , they serve as evidence that intermediates between very different types of vertebrates did once exist . The mixture of both fish and tetrapod characteristics found in Tiktaalik include these traits : 
 Fish 
 fish gills 
 fish scales 
 fish fins 
 " <unk> " 
 half @-@ fish , half @-@ tetrapod limb bones and joints , including a functional wrist joint and radiating , fish @-@ like fins instead of toes 
 half @-@ fish , half @-@ tetrapod ear region

 = = Phylogenetic position = = 
 = = = 2006 - 2010 = = = 
 The phylogenetic analysis by Daeschler et al. placed Tiktaalik as a sister taxon to <unk> and directly below Panderichthys preceded by <unk> . Tiktaalik was thus inserted above Acanthostega and Ichthyostega as a transitional form and a true " missing link " . 
 Such order of the phylogenetic tree was initially adopted by other experts , most notably by Per Ahlberg and Jennifer Clack . However , it was questioned in a 2008 paper by <unk> at al. who noted that Panderichthys , due to its more derived distal portion , might be closer to tetrapods than Tiktaalik or even that it was convergent with tetrapods . Ahlberg , co @-@ author of the study , considered the possibility of Tiktaalik 's fin having been " an evolutionary return to a more primitive form . " 
 = = = 2010 - now = = = 
 In January 2010 , a group of paleontologists ( including Ahlberg ) published a paper accompanied by extensive supplementary material ( discussed also in a Nature documentary ) which showed that first tetrapods appeared long before Tiktaalik and other elpistostegids . Their conclusions were based on numerous trackways ( esp . Muz . PGI <unk> ) and individual footprints ( esp . Muz . PGI <unk> ) discovered at the <unk> quarry in the Holy Cross Mountains ( Poland ) . A tetrapod origin of those tracks was established based on : 
 distinct digits and limb morphology ; 
 trackways reflecting quadrupedal gait and diagonal walk ; 
 no body or tail drag marks ; 
 very wide stride in relation to body length ( much beyond that of Tiktaalik or any other fish ) ; 
 various size footprints with some unusually big ( up to 26 cm wide ) indicating body lengths of over 2 @.@ 5 m . 
 Track @-@ bearing layers were assigned to the lower @-@ middle Eifelian based on conodont index fossil samples ( costatus Zone ) and " previous <unk> data obtained from the underlying and overlying strata " with subsequent studies confirming this dating . 
 Both <unk> 's discoverers were skeptical about the Zachelmie trackways . Edward Daeschler said that trace evidence was not enough for him to modify the theory of tetrapod evolution , while Neil Shubin argued that Tiktaalik could have produced very similar footprints ( in a later study Shubin expressed a significantly modified opinion that some of the Zachelmie footprints , those which lacked digits , may have been made by walking fish ) . However , Ahlberg insisted that those tracks could not have possibly been formed either by natural processes or by transitional species such as Tiktaalik or Panderichthys . Instead , the authors of the publication suggested <unk> as trackmakers , based on available pes morphology of those animals . However , a 2012 study indicated that Zachelmie trackmakers were even more advanced than Ichthyostega in terms of quadrupedalism . Grzegorz <unk> 's reconstruction of one of the trackmakers was identical to that of <unk> . 
 Prof. <unk> , co @-@ author of the article on the Zachelmie trackways , claimed that the Polish " discovery has disproved the theory that elpistostegids were the ancestors of tetrapods " , a notion partially shared by Philippe Janvier . There have been a number of new hypotheses suggested as to a possible origin and phylogenetic position of the elpistostegids ( including Tiktaalik ) : 
 their phylogenetic position remains unchanged and the footprints found in the Holy Cross Mountains are attributed to tetrapods but as a result there are at least six long ghost lineages separating Zachelmie trackmakers from various <unk> and <unk> species ; 
 they were " late @-@ surviving relics rather than direct transitional forms " ; 
 they were " an evolutionary dead @-@ end " ; 
 they were a result of convergent or parallel evolution so that apomorphies and striking anatomical similarities found in both <unk> tetrapods and <unk> evolved at least twice . 
 It should be noted that <unk> is considered responsible for uniquely tetrapod features found also in other non @-@ <unk> fish from the period like <unk> ( finger @-@ like jointed distal radial bones ) or <unk> ( tetrapod @-@ like spine with 5 axial regions ) . 
 Estimates published after the discovery of Zachelmie tracks suggested that <unk> tetrapods may have appeared as early as 427 @.@ 4 Ma ago and questioned attempts to read absolute timing of evolutionary events in early tetrapod evolution from stratigraphy . 
 Until more data becomes available , the phylogenetic position of Tiktaalik and other elpistostegids remains uncertain .

 In 2004 , three fossilized Tiktaalik skeletons were discovered in rock formed from late Devonian river sediments on Ellesmere Island , Nunavut , in northern Canada . Estimated ages reported at 375 Ma ago , 379 Ma ago , and 383 Ma ago . At the time of the species ' existence , Ellesmere Island was part of the continent Laurentia ( modern eastern North America and Greenland ) , which was centered on the equator and had a warm climate . When discovered , one of the skulls was found sticking out of a cliff . Upon further inspection , the fossil was found to be in excellent condition for a 375 @-@ million @-@ year @-@ old specimen . 
 The discovery , made by Edward B. Daeschler of the Academy of Natural Sciences , Neil H. Shubin from the University of Chicago , and Harvard University Professor Farish A. Jenkins , Jr , was published in the April 6 , 2006 , issue of Nature and quickly recognized as a transitional form . Jennifer A. Clack , a Cambridge University expert on tetrapod evolution , said of Tiktaalik , " It 's one of those things you can point to and say , ' I told you this would exist , ' and there it is . " 
 After five years of digging on Ellesmere Island , in the far north of Nunavut , they hit pay dirt : a collection of several fish so beautifully preserved that their skeletons were still intact . As Shubin 's team studied the species they saw to their excitement that it was exactly the missing intermediate they were looking for . ' We found something that really split the difference right down the middle , ' says Daeschler . 
 = Battle of Tassafaronga = 
 The Battle of Tassafaronga , sometimes referred to as the Fourth Battle of Savo Island or , in Japanese sources , as the Battle of Lunga Point ( <unk> ) , was a nighttime naval battle that took place on November 30 , 1942 between United States ( US ) Navy and Imperial Japanese Navy warships during the Guadalcanal campaign . The battle took place in Ironbottom Sound near the Tassafaronga area on Guadalcanal . 
 In the battle , a US warship force of five cruisers and four destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Carleton H. Wright attempted to surprise and destroy a Japanese warship force of eight destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Raizo Tanaka . Tanaka 's warships were attempting to deliver food supplies to Japanese forces on Guadalcanal . 
 Using radar , the US warships gained surprise , opened fire , and sank one of the Japanese destroyers . Tanaka and the rest of his ships , however , reacted quickly and launched numerous Type 93 " Long Lance " torpedoes at the US warships . The Japanese torpedoes hit and sank one US cruiser and heavily damaged three others , enabling the rest of Tanaka 's force to escape without significant additional damage but also without completing the intended supply delivery mission . Although a severe tactical defeat for the US , the battle had little strategic impact as the Japanese were unable to take advantage of the victory to further resupply or otherwise assist in their ultimately unsuccessful efforts to recapture Guadalcanal from Allied forces . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Guadalcanal Campaign = = = 
 On August 7 , 1942 , Allied forces ( primarily US ) landed on Guadalcanal , Tulagi , and the Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands . The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the US and Australia , and to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign with the eventual goal of neutralising the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign . The landings initiated the six @-@ month @-@ long Guadalcanal campaign . 
 The 2 @,@ 000 – 3 @,@ 000 Japanese personnel present on the islands were taken by surprise , and by nightfall on August 8 the 11 @,@ 000 Allied troops , under the command of Lieutenant General Alexander Vandegrift , secured Tulagi and nearby small islands as well as the Japanese airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal . The Allies later renamed the airfield Henderson Field . Allied aircraft operating out of Henderson were called the " Cactus Air Force " ( CAF ) after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal . To protect the airfield , the US Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point . Additional reinforcements over the next two months increased the number of US troops at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal to more than 20 @,@ 000 . 
 In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal , the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army 's 17th Army , a corps @-@ sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake , the task of retaking Guadalcanal . Units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal on August 19 to drive Allied forces from the island . 
 Because of the threat by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field , the Japanese were rarely able to use large , slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island . Instead , the Japanese used warships based at Rabaul and the Shortland Islands to carry their forces to Guadalcanal . The Japanese warships , mainly light cruisers and destroyers from the Eighth Fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa , were usually able to make the round trip down " The Slot " to Guadalcanal and back in a single night , thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack . Delivering the troops in this manner , however , prevented most of the soldiers ' heavy equipment and supplies , such as heavy artillery , vehicles , and much food and ammunition , from being carried to Guadalcanal with them . These high speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the " Tokyo Express " by Allied forces and " Rat Transportation " by the Japanese . 
 The Japanese attempted several times between August and November 1942 to recapture Henderson Field and drive Allied forces from Guadalcanal , to no avail . The last attempt by the Japanese to deliver significant additional forces to the island failed during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal of November 12 – 15 . 
 On November 26 , Japanese Lieutenant General Hitoshi Imamura took command of the newly formed Eighth Area Army at Rabaul . The new command encompassed both Hyakutake 's 17th Army in the Solomons and the 18th Army in New Guinea . One of Imamura 's first priorities upon assuming command was the continuation of the attempts to retake Henderson Field and Guadalcanal . The Allied offensive at Buna in New Guinea , however , changed Imamura 's priorities . Because the Allied attempt to take Buna was considered a more severe threat to Rabaul , Imamura postponed further major reinforcement efforts to Guadalcanal to concentrate on the situation in New Guinea . 
 = = = Supply crisis = = = 
 Due to a combination of the threat from CAF aircraft , US Navy PT boats stationed at Tulagi , and a cycle of bright moonlight , the Japanese had switched to using submarines to deliver provisions to their forces on Guadalcanal . Beginning on November 16 , 1942 , and continuing for the next three weeks , 16 submarines made nocturnal deliveries of foodstuffs to the island , with one submarine making the trip each night . Each submarine could deliver 20 to 30 tons of supplies , about one day 's worth of food , for the 17th Army , but the difficult task of transporting the supplies by hand through the jungle to the frontline units limited their value to sustain the Japanese troops on Guadalcanal . At the same time , the Japanese tried to establish a chain of three bases in the central Solomons to allow small boats to use them as staging sites for making supply deliveries to Guadalcanal , but damaging Allied airstrikes on the bases forced the abandonment of this plan . 
 On November 26 , the 17th Army notified Imamura that it faced a critical food crisis . Some front @-@ line units had not been resupplied for six days and even the rear @-@ area troops were on one @-@ third rations . The situation forced the Japanese to return to using destroyers to deliver the necessary supplies . 
 Eighth Fleet personnel devised a plan to help reduce the exposure of destroyers delivering supplies to Guadalcanal . Large oil or gas drums were cleaned and filled with medical supplies and food , with enough air space to provide buoyancy , and strung together with rope . When the destroyers arrived at Guadalcanal they would make a sharp turn , the drums would be cut loose , and a swimmer or boat from shore could pick up the buoyed end of a rope and return it to the beach , where the soldiers could haul in the supplies . 
 The Eighth Fleet 's Guadalcanal Reinforcement Unit , based in the Shortland Islands and under the command of Rear Admiral Raizo Tanaka , was tasked by Mikawa with making the first of five scheduled runs using the drum method on the night of November 30 . Tanaka 's unit was centered on the eight ships of Destroyer Squadron ( <unk> ) 2 , with six destroyers assigned to carry from 200 to 240 drums of supplies apiece , to Tassafaronga at Guadalcanal . Tanaka 's flagship Naganami along with Takanami acted as escorts . The six drum @-@ carrying destroyers were Kuroshio , Oyashio , <unk> , Suzukaze , Kawakaze , and Makinami . To save weight , the drum @-@ carrying destroyers left their reloads of Type 93 torpedoes ( Long Lances ) at the Shortlands , leaving each ship with eight torpedoes , one for each tube . 
 After the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal , US Vice Admiral William Halsey , commander of Allied forces in the South Pacific , had reorganized US naval forces under his command , including , on November 24 , the formation of Task Force 67 ( TF67 ) at Espiritu Santo , comprising the heavy cruisers USS Minneapolis , New Orleans , Pensacola , and Northampton , the light cruiser Honolulu , and four destroyers ( Fletcher , Drayton , Maury , and Perkins ) . US Rear Admiral Carleton H. Wright replaced Thomas Kinkaid as commander of TF67 on November 28 . 
 Upon taking command , Wright briefed his ship commanders on his plan for engaging the Japanese in future , expected night battles around Guadalcanal . The plan , which he had drafted with Kinkaid , stated that radar @-@ equipped destroyers were to scout in front of the cruisers and deliver a surprise torpedo attack upon sighting Japanese warships , then vacate the area to give the cruisers a clear field of fire . The cruisers were then to engage with gunfire from 10 @,@ 000 yards ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) to 12 @,@ 000 yards ( 11 @,@ 000 m ) . The cruisers ' floatplanes would scout and drop flares during the battle . 
 On November 29 , Allied intelligence personnel intercepted and decoded a Japanese message transmitted to the 17th Army on Guadalcanal alerting them to Tanaka 's supply run . Informed of the message , Halsey ordered Wright to take TF67 to intercept Tanaka off Guadalcanal . TF67 , with Wright flying his flag on Minneapolis , departed Espiritu Santo at 27 knots ( 31 mph ; 50 km / h ) just before midnight on November 29 for the 580 miles ( 930 km ) run to Guadalcanal . En route , destroyers Lamson and Lardner , returning from a convoy escort assignment to Guadalcanal , were ordered to join up with TF67 . Lacking the time to brief the commanding officers of the joining destroyers of his battle plan , Wright assigned them a position behind the cruisers . At 17 : 00 on November 30 , Wright 's cruisers launched one floatplane each for Tulagi to drop flares during the expected battle that night . At 20 : 00 , Wright sent his crews to battle stations . 
 Tanaka 's force departed the Shortlands just after midnight on November 30 for the run to Guadalcanal . Tanaka attempted to evade Allied aerial reconnaissance aircraft by first heading northeast through Bougainville Strait before turning southeast and then south to pass through Indispensable Strait . Paul Mason , an Australian coastwatcher stationed in southern Bougainville , reported by radio the departure of Tanaka 's ships from Shortland and this message was passed to Wright . At the same time , a Japanese search aircraft spotted an Allied convoy near Guadalcanal and communicated the sighting to Tanaka who told his destroyer commanders to expect action that night and that , " In such an event , utmost efforts will be made to destroy the enemy without regard for the unloading of supplies . "

 = = = Prelude = = = 
 At 21 : 40 on November 30 , Tanaka 's ships sighted Savo Island from Indispensable Strait . The Japanese ships were in line ahead formation , interval 600 metres ( 660 yd ) , in the order of Takanami , Oyashio , Kuroshio , Kagero , Makinami , Naganami , Kawakaze , and Suzukaze . At this same time , TF67 entered <unk> Channel en route to Ironbottom Sound . Wright 's ships were in column in the order Fletcher , Perkins , Maury , Drayton , Minneapolis , New Orleans , Pensacola , Honolulu , Northampton , Lamson , and Lardner . The four van destroyers led the cruisers by 4 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) and the cruisers steamed 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) apart . 
 At 22 : 40 , Tanaka 's ships passed south of Savo about 3 miles ( 5 km ) offshore from Guadalcanal and slowed to 12 knots ( 14 mph ; 22 km / h ) as they approached the unloading area . Takanami took station about 1 mile ( 2 km ) seaward to screen the column . At the same time , TF67 exited <unk> Channel into the sound and headed at 20 knots ( 23 mph ; 37 km / h ) towards Savo Island . Wright 's van destroyers moved to a position slightly inshore of the cruisers . The night sky was moonless with between 2 miles ( 3 km ) and 7 miles ( 11 km ) of visibility . Because of extremely calm seas which created a suction effect on their pontoons , Wright 's cruiser floatplanes were delayed in lifting off from Tulagi harbor , and would not be a factor in the battle . 
 At 23 : 06 , Wright 's force began to detect Tanaka 's ships on radar near Cape Esperance on Guadalcanal about 23 @,@ 000 yards ( 21 @,@ 000 m ) away . Wright 's destroyers rejoined the column as it continued to head towards Savo . At the same time , Tanaka 's ships , which were not equipped with radar , split into two groups and prepared to shove the drums overboard . Naganami , Kawakaze , and Suzukaze headed for their drop @-@ off point near Doma Reef while Makinami , Kagero , Oyashio , and <unk> aimed for nearby Tassafaronga . At 23 : 12 , Takanami 's crew visually sighted Wright 's column , quickly confirmed by lookouts on Tanaka 's other ships . At 23 : 16 , Tanaka ordered unloading preparations halted and " All ships attack . " 
 = = = Action = = = 
 At 23 : 14 , operators on Fletcher established firm radar contact with Takanami and the lead group of four drum @-@ carrying destroyers . At 23 : 15 , with the range 7 @,@ 000 yards ( 6 @,@ 400 m ) , Commander William M. Cole , commander of Wright 's destroyer group and captain of Fletcher , radioed Wright for permission to fire torpedoes . Wright waited two minutes and then responded with , " Range on bogies [ Tanaka 's ships on radar ] excessive at present . " Cole responded that the range was fine . Another two minutes passed before Wright responded with permission to fire . In the meantime , the US destroyer 's targets escaped from an optimum firing setup ahead to a marginal position passing abeam , giving the American torpedoes a long overtaking run near the limit of their range . At 23 : 20 , Fletcher , Perkins , and Drayton fired a total of 20 Mark 15 torpedoes towards Tanaka 's ships . Maury , lacking SG radar and thus having no contacts , withheld fire . 
 At the same time , Wright ordered his force to open fire . At 23 : 21 , Minneapolis complied with her first salvo , quickly followed by the other American cruisers . Cole 's four destroyers fired star shells to illuminate the targets as previously directed then increased speed to clear the area for the cruisers to operate . 
 Because of her closer proximity to Wright 's column , Takanami was the target of most of the American 's initial gunfire . Takanami returned fire and launched her full load of eight torpedoes , but was quickly hit by American gunfire and , within four minutes , was set afire and incapacitated . As Takanami was destroyed , the rest of Tanaka 's ships , almost unnoticed by the Americans , were increasing speed , maneuvering , and preparing to respond to the American attack . All of the American torpedoes missed . Historian Russell S. Crenshaw , Jr. postulates that had the twenty @-@ four Mark 15 torpedoes fired by U.S. Navy destroyers during the battle not been fatally flawed , the outcome of the battle might have been different . 
 Tanaka 's flagship , Naganami , reversed course to starboard , opened fire and began laying a smoke screen . The next two ships astern , Kawakaze and Suzukaze , reversed course to port . At 23 : 23 , Suzukaze fired eight torpedoes in the direction of the <unk> from Wright 's cruisers , followed by Naganami and Kawakaze which fired their full loads of eight torpedoes at 23 : 32 and 23 : 33 respectively . 
 Meanwhile , the four destroyers at the head of the Japanese column maintained their heading down the Guadalcanal coast , allowing Wright 's cruisers to pass on the opposite course . Once clear of Takanami at 23 : 28 , Kuroshio fired four and Oyashio fired eight torpedoes in the direction of Wright 's column and then reversed course and increased speed . Wright 's cruisers maintained the same course and speed as the 44 Japanese torpedoes headed in their direction . 
 At 23 : 27 , as Minneapolis fired her ninth salvo and Wright prepared to order a course change for his column , two torpedoes , from either Suzukaze or Takanami , slammed into her forward half . One warhead exploded the aviation fuel storage tanks forward of turret one and the other knocked out three of the ship 's four <unk> . The bow forward of turret one folded down at a 70 @-@ degree angle and the ship lost power and steering control . Thirty @-@ seven men were killed . 
 Less than a minute later a torpedo hit New Orleans abreast of turret one and exploded the ship 's forward ammunition magazines and aviation gasoline storage . The blast severed the ship 's entire bow forward of turret two . The bow twisted to port , damaging the ship 's hull as it was wrenched free by the ship 's momentum , and sank immediately off the aft port quarter . Everyone in turrets one and two perished . New Orleans was forced into a reverse course to starboard and lost steering and communications . A total of 183 men were killed . Herbert Brown , a seaman in the ship 's plotting room , described the scene after the torpedo hit , 
 I had to see . I walked alongside the silent turret two and was stopped by a lifeline stretched from the outboard port lifeline to the side of the turret . Thank God it was there , for one more step and I would have pitched head first into the dark water thirty feet below . The bow was gone . One hundred and twenty five feet of ship and number one main battery turret with three 8 inch guns were gone . Eighteen hundred tons of ship were gone . Oh my God , all those guys I went through boot camp with - all gone . 
 Pensacola followed next astern in the cruiser column . Observing Minneapolis and New Orleans taking hits and slowing , Pensacola steered to pass them on the port side and then , once past , returned to the same base course . At 23 : 39 , Pensacola took a torpedo abreast the mainmast . The explosion spread flaming oil throughout the interior and across the main deck of the ship , killing 125 of the ship 's crew . The hit ripped away the port outer driveshaft and the ship took a 13 @-@ degree list and lost power , communications , and steering . 
 Astern of Pensacola , Honolulu 's captain chose to pass Minneapolis and New Orleans on the starboard side . At the same time , the ship increased speed to 30 knots ( 35 mph ; 56 km / h ) , maneuvered radically , and successfully transited the battle area without taking any damage while maintaining main battery fire at the rapidly disappearing Japanese destroyers . 
 The last cruiser in the American column , Northampton , followed Honolulu to pass the damaged cruisers ahead to starboard . Unlike Honolulu , Northampton did not increase speed or attempt any radical maneuvers . At 23 : 48 , after returning to the base course , Northampton was hit by two of Kawakaze 's torpedoes . One hit 10 feet ( 3 m ) below the waterline abreast the after engine room , and four seconds later , the second hit 40 feet ( 12 m ) further aft . The after engine room flooded , three of four shafts ceased turning , and the ship listed 10 degrees to port and caught fire . Fifty men were killed . 
 The last ships in Wright 's column , Lamson and Lardner , failed to locate any targets and exited the battle area to the east after being mistakenly fired on by machine guns from New Orleans . Cole 's four destroyers circled completely around Savo Island at maximum speed and reentered the battle area , but the engagement had already ended . 
 Meanwhile , at 23 : 44 Tanaka ordered his ships to break contact and retire from the battle area . As they proceeded up Guadalcanal 's coast , Kuroshio and Kagero fired eight more torpedoes towards the American ships , which all missed . When Takanami failed to respond to radio calls , Tanaka directed Oyashio and Kuroshio to go to her assistance . The two destroyers located the burning ship at 01 : 00 on December 1 but abandoned rescue efforts after detecting American warships in the area . Oyashio and Kuroshio quickly departed the sound to rejoin the rest of Tanaka 's ships for the return journey to the Shortlands , which they reached 10 hours later . Takanami was the only Japanese warship hit by American gunfire and seriously damaged during the battle . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Takanami 's surviving crew abandoned ship at 01 : 30 , but a large explosion killed many more of them in the water , including the destroyer division commander , Toshio Shimizu , and the ship 's captain , Masami Ogura . Of her crew of 244 , 48 survived to reach shore on Guadalcanal and 19 of them were captured by the Americans . 
 Northampton 's crew was unable to contain the ship 's fires and list and began to abandon ship at 01 : 30 . The ship sank at 03 : 04 about 4 miles ( 6 km ) from Doma Cove on Guadalcanal ( 09 ° 12 ′ S 159 ° 50 ′ E ) . Fletcher and Drayton rescued the ship 's 773 survivors . 
 Minneapolis , New Orleans , and Pensacola were able to make it the 19 miles ( 31 km ) to Tulagi on the morning of December 1 where they were berthed for emergency repairs . The fires on Pensacola burned for 12 hours before being extinguished . Pensacola departed Tulagi for rear area ports and further repair on December 6 . After construction of temporary bows from coconut logs , Minneapolis and New Orleans departed Tulagi for Espiritu Santo or Sydney , Australia on December 12 . All three cruisers required lengthy and extensive repairs . New Orleans returned to action in August , Minneapolis in September , and Pensacola in October 1943 . 
 The battle was one of the worst defeats suffered by the US Navy in World War II , third only to the Attack on Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Savo Island . The battle , along with the losses suffered during the Battle of Savo Island , Cape Esperance and the Naval Battles of Guadalcanal temporarily left the US Navy with only 4 operational heavy cruisers and 9 light cruisers in the entire Pacific Ocean . In spite of his defeat in the battle , Wright was awarded the Navy Cross , one of the highest American military decorations for bravery , for his actions during the engagement . Mitigating to some degree the destruction of his task force , Wright , in his after @-@ action report , claimed that his force sank four Japanese destroyers and damaged two others . Halsey , in his comments on Wright 's report , placed much of the blame for the defeat on Cole , saying that the destroyer squadron commander fired his torpedoes from too great a distance to be effective and should have " helped " the cruisers instead of circling around Savo Island . Tanaka claimed to have sunk a battleship and two cruisers in the battle . 
 The results of the battle led to further discussion in the US Pacific Fleet about changes in tactical doctrine and the need for technical improvements , such as flashless powder . It was not until eight months later that the naval high command recognized there were serious problems with the functioning of the torpedoes . The Americans were still unaware of the range and power of Japanese torpedoes and the effectiveness of Japanese night battle tactics . In fact , Wright claimed that his ships must have been fired on by submarines since the observed position of Tanaka 's ships " make it improbable that torpedoes with speed @-@ distance characteristics similar to our own " could have caused such damage , though Tanaka states that his torpedoes were fired at a range as short as three miles . The Americans would not recognize the true capabilities of their Pacific adversary 's torpedoes ( particularly the surface @-@ ship @-@ fired Type 93 " Long Lance " ) and night tactics until well into 1943 . After the war , Tanaka said of his victory at Tassafaronga , " I have heard that US naval experts praised my command in that action . I am not deserving of such honors . It was the superb proficiency and devotion of the men who served me that produced the tactical victory for us . " 
 In spite of their defeat in the battle , the Americans had prevented Tanaka from landing the desperately needed food supplies on Guadalcanal , albeit at high cost . A second Japanese supply delivery attempt by 10 destroyers led by Tanaka on December 3 successfully dumped 1 @,@ 500 drums of provisions off Tassafaronga , but strafing American aircraft sank all but 310 of them the next day before they could be pulled ashore . On December 7 , a third attempt by 12 destroyers was turned back by US PT boats off Cape Esperance . The next night , two US PT boats torpedoed and sank the Japanese submarine I @-@ 3 as it attempted to deliver supplies to Guadalcanal . Based on the difficulties experienced trying to deliver food to the island , the Japanese Navy informed Imamura on December 8 that they intended to stop all destroyer transportation runs to Guadalcanal immediately . After Imamura protested , the navy agreed to one more run to the island . 
 The last attempt to deliver food to Guadalcanal by destroyers in 1942 was led by Tanaka on the night of December 11 and consisted of 11 destroyers . Five US PT boats met Tanaka off Guadalcanal and torpedoed his flagship Teruzuki , severely damaging the destroyer and injuring Tanaka . After Tanaka transferred to Naganami , Teruzuki was scuttled . Only 220 of the 1 @,@ 200 drums released that night were recovered by Japanese army personnel on shore . Tanaka was subsequently relieved of command and transferred to Japan on December 29 , 1942 . 
 On December 12 , the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned . Despite opposition from Japanese Army leaders , who still hoped that Guadalcanal could eventually be retaken from the Allies , on December 31 , 1942 Japan 's Imperial General Headquarters , with approval from the Emperor , agreed to the evacuation of all Japanese forces from the island and the establishment of a new line of defense for the Solomons on New Georgia . The Japanese evacuated their remaining forces from Guadalcanal over three nights between February 2 and February 7 , 1943 , conceding the hard fought campaign to the Allies . Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere , the Allies continued their campaign against Japan , ultimately culminating in Japan 's defeat and the end of World War II .

 Nights into Dreams ... ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : Naitsu , stylised as NiGHTS into Dreams ... ) is an action video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Saturn in 1996 . The story follows two teenagers , Claris and Elliot , who enter a dream world called Nightopia where all dreams take place . With the help of Nights , an exiled " Nightmaren " , they begin a journey to stop the evil ruler Wizeman from destroying Nightopia and consequently the real world . Gameplay is centred around Nights flying through Claris and Elliot 's dreams to gather enough energy to defeat Wizeman and save Nightopia . The game is presented in 3D and imposes time limits on every level , in which the player must accumulate enough points to proceed . 
 Development began soon after the release of Sonic & Knuckles in 1994 , although the concept originated during the development of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 ( 1992 ) . Development was led by Sonic Team veterans Yuji Naka , Naoto Ohshima , and Takashi Iizuka . Naka began the project with the main idea revolving around flight , and Ohshima designed the character Nights to resemble an angel that could fly like a bird . Ohshima designed Nights specifically as an androgynous character . The team conducted research on dreaming and REM sleep , and was influenced by the works and theories of psychoanalysts Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud . An analogue controller , known as the Saturn 3D controller , was designed alongside the game and was included with some retail copies sold . 
 Nights into Dreams ... received positive reviews upon release ; critics praised the graphics , gameplay , soundtrack , and atmosphere . It has been included on multiple lists as being the best Sega Saturn game of all time , as well as among the best games ever made . An abbreviated version of the game with a Christmas theme , titled Christmas Nights , was released in December 1996 . The game was ported to the PlayStation 2 in 2008 exclusively in Japan and a high @-@ definition version was released worldwide for PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , and Microsoft Windows in 2012 . A direct sequel , Nights : Journey of Dreams , was released for the Wii in 2007 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Nights into Dreams ... is split into seven levels , referred to as " Dreams " . The levels are distributed equally between the two teenage characters : three are unique to Claris , three to Elliot , and each play through an identical final seventh level , " Twin Seeds " . Initially , only Claris ' Spring Valley and Elliot 's Splash Garden levels are available , and successful completion of one of these unlocks the next level in that character 's path . Previously completed stages may be revisited to improve the player 's high scores ; a grade between A and F will be given to the player upon completion , but a " C " grade in all the selected character 's levels must be achieved to unlock the relevant Twin Seeds stage for that character . Points are accumulated depending on how fast the player completes a level , and extra points are awarded when the player flies through rings . 
 Each level is split up into four " Mares " set in Nightopia and a boss fight which takes place in Nightmare . In each level , players initially control Claris or Elliot , who immediately have their <unk> ( spherical objects that contain emotions ) of hope , growth , intelligence and purity stolen from them by Wizeman 's minions , leaving behind only their Ideya of courage . The goal of each Mare is to recover one of the stolen Ideya by collecting 20 blue chips and delivering them to the cage holding the <unk> , which will overload and release the orb it holds . If the player walks around the landscape for too long , they will be pursued by a sentient alarm clock which will awaken the character and end the level if it comes into contact with the player . The majority of the gameplay centres on flying sequences , which are triggered by walking into the Ideya Palace near the start of each level so that the character merges with the imprisoned Nights . Once the flying sequence is initiated , the time limit will begin . 
 In the flying sections , the player controls Nights ' flight along a predetermined route through each Mare , resembling that of a 2D platformer . The player has only a limited period of time available before Nights falls to the ground and transforms back into Claris or Elliot , and each collision with an enemy subtracts five seconds from the time remaining . While flying , Nights can use a boost to travel faster , as well as defeat certain reverie enemies scattered throughout the level . Grabbing onto certain enemies causes Nights to spin around , which will launch both Nights and the enemy in the direction the boost was initiated . Various acrobatic manoeuvres can be performed , including the " <unk> " , whereby flying around in a complete circle and connecting the trail of stars left in Nights ' wake will cause any items within the loop to be attracted towards Nights . The game features a combo system known as " Linking " , whereby actions such as collecting items and flying through rings are worth more points when performed in quick succession . Power @-@ ups may be gained by flying through several predetermined rings , which will be indicated by a bonus barrel . The power @-@ ups include a speed boost , point multiplier and an air pocket . 
 The player receives a grade based on their score at the end of each Mare , and an overall grade for the level after clearing all four Mares . Nights is then transported to Nightmare for a boss fight against one of Wizeman 's " Level Two " <unk> . Each boss fight has a time limit , and the game will end if the player runs out of time during the battle . Upon winning the boss fight , the player is awarded a score multiplier based on how quickly the boss was defeated , which is then applied to the score earned in the Nightopia section to produce the player 's final score for that Dream . The game also features a multiplayer mode , which allows two players to battle each other by using a splitscreen . One player controls Nights , whereas the other controls the secondary antagonist , Reala . The winner is determined by the first player to defeat the other , which is accomplished by hitting the other player three times . 
 The game features an artificial life system known as " A @-@ Life " , which involves entities called Nightopians and keeps track of their moods . It is possible to have them mate with other Nightopians , which will result in creating hybrids known as " <unk> " . The more the game is played , the more inhabitants appear , and environmental features and aesthetics will consequently change . The A @-@ Life system features an evolving music engine , allowing tempo , pitch , and melody to alter depending on the state of Nightopians within the level . The feature runs from the Sega Saturn 's internal clock , which will also alter features in the A @-@ Life system depending on the time .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Every night , all human dreams are played out in Nightopia and Nightmare , the two parts of the dream world . In Nightopia , distinct aspects of dreamers ' personalities are represented by luminous coloured spheres known as " Ideya " . The evil ruler of Nightmare , Wizeman the Wicked , is stealing this dream energy from sleeping visitors in order to gather power and take control of Nightopia and eventually the real world . To achieve this , he creates five beings called " Nightmaren " : jester @-@ like , flight @-@ capable beings , which include <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Puffy as well as many minor <unk> .

 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 One day , Elliot Edwards and Claris Sinclair , two teenagers from the city of Twin Seeds , go through failures . Elliot is a basketball player who enjoys a game with his friends . He is challenged by a group of older school students and suffers a humiliating defeat on the court . Claris is a talented singer and her ambition is to perform on stage . She auditions for a part in the events commemorating the centenary of the city of Twin Seeds . Standing in front of the judges , she is overcome by stage fright and does not perform well , which causes her to lose all hopes of getting the role . When they go to sleep that night , both Elliot and Claris suffer nightmares that replay the events . They escape into Nightopia and find that they both possess the rare Red Ideya of Courage , the only type that Wizeman cannot steal . 
 Once in Nightopia , they discover and release Nights , who tells them about dreams and Wizeman and his plans ; the three begin a journey to stop Wizeman and restore peace to Nightopia . When they defeat Wizeman and Reala , peace is returned to Nightopia and the world of Nightmare is suppressed . The next day , back in Twin Seeds , a centenary ceremony begins . Elliot is seen walking through the parade until he has a vision of Nights looking at him through a hoarding . Realising that Claris is performing in a hall , Elliot runs through the crowd and sees Claris on stage in front of a large audience , singing well . The two look at each other , and are transitioned to a spring valley in Nightopia , which leaves ambiguity as to whether what they achieved was real or just a dream . 
 = = Development = = 
 Sonic Team developed the game in the United States , unlike their previous titles which had been developed in Japan . The concept for the game originated during the development of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in 1992 , but actual development did not begin until after the release of Sonic & Knuckles in late 1994 . The programming of the game began in April 1995 and total development spanned a period of six months . The development team consisted of staff who worked on previous Sonic the Hedgehog titles : Yuji Naka ( the former head of <unk> ) was selected to act as lead programmer and producer , while Naoto Ohshima and Takashi Iizuka undertook the roles of director and lead designer , respectively . According to Naka , the initial development team consisted of seven people at the start of production , and gradually grew to 20 people once more programmers started to arrive . 
 Sonic the Hedgehog creator and project director Ohshima created the character of Nights based on his inspirations from travelling around Europe and western Asia . He eventually came to the conclusion that the main character of the game should resemble an angel and fly like a bird . Naka originally intended to make Nights into Dreams ... a slow @-@ paced game , but as development progressed the gameplay pace gradually increased , in similar vein to Sonic the Hedgehog titles . The initial concept of the game featured the flying character in a rendered 2D sprite art , with side @-@ scrolling features similar to Sonic the Hedgehog . The team were at first hesitant to switch the game from 2D to 3D , as Naka was sceptical that appealing characters could be created with polygons , in contrast to traditional pixel art sprites , which Sonic Team 's designers found " more expressive " . According to Izuka , the game design and story took two years to finalise . 
 The game was developed using Silicon Graphics workstations for graphical designs and Sega Saturn emulators running on Hewlett @-@ Packard machines for programming . Izuka said that there were problems during early stages of development because of a lack of games to use as reference ; the team consequently had to redesign the Spring Valley level numerous times and build " everything from scratch " . Because the Sonic Team offices did not include any sound @-@ proof studios , team members were forced to record vocal sound effects for the game at night . Naka revealed that every phrase in the game has a meaning ; for example " <unk> " is Japanese slang for " goodbye " . Regarding the design of the 3D cutscenes , the team felt that the global market would be less resistant to a game featuring full 3D CGI in comparison to 2D anime . Norihiro Nishiyama , the designer of the in @-@ game movies , stated that the use of 3D cutscenes in the game was necessary as he felt the movies were a good method to show the different concepts of dreaming and waking up into reality . Naka said that the in @-@ game movies incorporate realism in order to make it more difficult for the player to disambiguate the boundary between dreams and reality . 
 At the end of development , Naka admitted that the cycle took longer than expected because of the team 's inexperience with Saturn hardware and uncertainty about utilising the full 560 megabyte space on the CD @-@ ROM . The team initially thought that the game would consume around 100 megabytes of data , and at one point considered releasing it on two separate discs . In a retrospective interview , Iizuka said that the most difficult part of development was finding a way of handling the " contradiction " of using 2D sidescroller controls in a fully 3D game . Naka also purposely limited the game 's flying mechanic to " invisible 2D tracks " because early beta testing revealed that the game was too difficult to play in full 3D . 
 Iizuka said that the game was inspired by various titles and characters from Japanese anime and Cirque du Soleil 's Mystère theatrical performance . The development team researched dream sequences and REM sleep , including the works of the psychoanalysts Carl Jung , Sigmund Freud and Friedrich Holtz . Iizuka analysed Jung 's theories of dream archetypes and spent a considerable amount of time studying dreams and theories associated with them . Naka said that the main protagonist , Nights , is reflective of Jung 's analytical " shadow " theory , whereas the two central characters , Claris and Elliot , were inspired by Jung 's animus and anima .

 Nights into Dreams ... was introduced alongside an optional game controller , the Saturn 3D controller , which was included with some copies of the game . The gamepad features an analogue stick and analogue triggers which was designed specifically for the game , in order to make movement easier . During development , director Steven Spielberg visited the Sonic Team studio and became the first person outside the development team to play the game . Naka asked him to play with an experimental version of the Saturn 3D controller , and was jokingly referred to as the " Spielberg controller " throughout development . The controller was designed with the game specifically in mind ; the development team compared the success of the Nintendo 64 controller with Super Mario 64 ( 1996 ) , and realised that the default Saturn controller was more suited for arcade games in contrast to the gameplay of Nights into Dreams .... The game was marketed with an advertising budget of $ 10 million , which included the use of television and print advertisements in the United States .

 Christmas Nights ( <unk> , Kurisumasu Naitsu ) , or Christmas NiGHTS into Dreams ... , is a Christmas @-@ themed two @-@ level game of Nights into Dreams ... that was released in December 1996 . It was introduced in Japan as part of a Christmas Sega Saturn bundle , whereas elsewhere it was given away with the purchase of certain Saturn games such as Daytona USA Championship Circuit Edition ( 1996 ) , and was also bundled in with issues of Sega Saturn Magazine and Next Generation Magazine . In the United Kingdom , Christmas Nights was not included with the Sega Saturn Magazine until December 1997 . 
 The story of Christmas Nights follows Elliot and Claris during the holiday season following their adventures with Nights . Though they both enjoy the Christmas season , they feel as if something is missing . Realising that the Christmas Star that usually sits at the top of the Twin Seeds Christmas tree is absent , the pair travel to Nightopia to find it . There , they reunite with Nights and re @-@ explore Spring Valley , which has now been decorated due to their dreams of the holiday season . The remainder of the story revolves around their attempts of defeating a revived <unk> and retrieving the Christmas Star from his lair . 
 The Christmas Nights disc contains the full version of Claris ' Spring Valley dream level from Nights into Dreams ... , which allows both Claris and Elliot to play through the area . The game uses the Saturn 's internal clock to change elements of the game according to the date and time . During December , " Christmas Nights " mode is activated , resulting in further Christmas @-@ themed alterations , such as item boxes becoming Christmas presents , greenery becoming snow , Nightopians dressing in elf costumes , and Christmas trees replacing Ideya captures . During the " Winter Nights " period , the weather in Spring Valley will change according to the hour . Other cosmetic changes are visible on New Year 's Day , and loading the game on April Fool 's Day results in Reala replacing Nights as the playable character . 
 In a 2007 interview , Iizuka stated that the Christmas @-@ themed add @-@ on Christmas Nights was conceptualised in order to increase the sales of Saturn consoles . Development of Christmas Nights began in July 1996 and took " three to four " months to complete , according to Naka . The disc features several unlockable bonuses such as being able to play the game 's soundtrack . Further extra modes allow players to observe the status of the A @-@ life system , experiment with the game 's music mixer , time attack one Mare , or play the demo stage as Sega 's mascot Sonic the Hedgehog . In the minigame Sonic the Hedgehog : Into Dreams , Sonic may only play through the stage of Spring Valley on foot , and must defeat the boss : an inflatable Dr. Robotnik . The music is a remixed version of " Final Fever " , the final boss battle music from the Japanese and European version of Sonic CD ( 1993 ) . The Christmas Nights content is playable in the HD version after the game has been cleared once .

 A game with the working title " Air Nights " was prototyped for the Saturn and began development for the Dreamcast , and in an August 1999 interview Yuji Naka confirmed that a sequel was in development ; by December 2000 , however , the project had been cancelled . Naka expressed reluctance to develop a sequel , but subsequently noted that he was interested in using Nights into Dreams ... as a licence " to reinforce Sega 's identity " . Aside from a handheld electronic game released by Tiger Electronics and small minigames featured in several Sega titles , no full sequel was released for a Sega console . 
 On 1 April 2007 , a sequel called Nights : Journey of Dreams was officially announced for the Wii .

The gameplay involves the use of various masks , and features a multiplayer mode for two players in addition to Nintendo Wi @-@ Fi Connection online functions . The game was developed by Sega Studio USA , with Iizuka , one of the designers of the original game , serving as producer . It was released in Japan and the United States in December 2007 , and in Europe and Australia on 18 January 2008 . 
 In 2010 , Iizuka commented that he would be interested in making a third Nights into Dreams ... game , should the management of Sega decide to commission one .

 = Trial by Jury = 
 Trial by Jury is a comic opera in one act , with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert . It was first produced on 25 March 1875 , at London 's Royalty Theatre , where it initially ran for 131 performances and was considered a hit , receiving critical praise and outrunning its popular companion piece , Jacques Offenbach 's La Périchole . The story concerns a " breach of promise of marriage " lawsuit in which the judge and legal system are the objects of lighthearted satire . Gilbert based the libretto of Trial by Jury on an operetta parody that he had written in 1868 . 
 The opera premiered more than three years after Gilbert and Sullivan 's only previous collaboration , Thespis , an 1871 – 72 Christmas season entertainment . In the intervening years , both the author and composer were busy with separate projects . Beginning in 1873 , Gilbert tried several times to get the opera produced before the impresario Richard D 'Oyly Carte suggested that he collaborate on it with Sullivan . Sullivan was pleased with the piece and promptly wrote the music . 
 As with most Gilbert and Sullivan operas , the plot of Trial by Jury is ludicrous , but the characters behave as if the events were perfectly reasonable . This narrative technique blunts some of the pointed barbs aimed at hypocrisy , especially of those in authority , and the sometimes base motives of supposedly respectable people and institutions . These themes became favourites of Gilbert through the rest of his collaborations with Sullivan . Critics and audiences praised how well Sullivan 's witty and good @-@ humoured music complemented Gilbert 's satire . The success of Trial by Jury launched the famous series of 13 collaborative works between Gilbert and Sullivan that came to be known as the Savoy Operas . 
 After its original production in 1875 , Trial by Jury toured widely in Britain and elsewhere and was frequently revived and recorded . It also became popular as a part of charity benefits . The work continues to be frequently played , especially as a companion piece to other short Gilbert and Sullivan operas or other works . According to theatre scholar Kurt Gänzl , it is " probably the most successful British one @-@ act operetta of all time " . 
 = = Background = = 
 Before Trial by Jury , W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan had collaborated on one previous opera , Thespis ; or , The Gods Grown Old , in 1871 . Although reasonably successful , it was a Christmas entertainment , and such works were not expected to endure . Between Thespis and Trial by Jury , Gilbert and Sullivan did not collaborate on any further operas , and each man separately produced works that further built his reputation in his own field . Gilbert wrote several short stories , edited the second volume of his comic Bab Ballads , and created a dozen theatrical works , including Happy Arcadia in 1872 ; The Wicked World , The Happy Land and The Realm of Joy in 1873 ; Charity , Topsyturveydom and Sweethearts in 1874 . At the same time , Sullivan wrote various pieces of religious music , including the Festival Te Deum ( 1872 ) and an oratorio , The Light of the World ( 1873 ) , and edited Church Hymns , with Tunes ( 1874 ) , which included 45 of his own hymns and arrangements . Two of his most famous hymn tunes from this period are settings to " Onward , Christian Soldiers " and " Nearer , my God , to Thee " ( both in 1872 ) . He also wrote a suite of incidental music to The Merry Wives of Windsor ( 1874 ) and many parlour ballads and other songs , including three in 1874 – 75 with words by Gilbert : " The Distant Shore " , " Sweethearts " ( inspired by Gilbert 's play ) and " The Love that Loves Me Not " . 
 = = = Genesis of the opera = = = 
 The genesis of Trial by Jury began in 1868 , when Gilbert wrote a single @-@ page illustrated comic piece for the magazine Fun entitled Trial by Jury : An Operetta . Drawing on Gilbert 's training and brief practice as a barrister , it detailed a " breach of promise " trial going awry , in the process spoofing the law , lawyers and the legal system . ( In the Victorian era , a man could be required to pay compensation should he fail to marry a woman to whom he was engaged . ) The outline of this story was followed in the later opera , and two of its numbers appeared in nearly their final form in Fun . The skit , however , ended abruptly : the moment the attractive plaintiff stepped into the witness box , the judge leapt into her arms and vowed to marry her , whereas in the opera , the case is allowed to proceed further before this conclusion is reached . 
 In 1873 , Gilbert arranged with the opera manager and composer , Carl Rosa , to expand the piece into a one @-@ act libretto . Rosa was to write or commission the music , and Euphrosyne <unk> @-@ Rosa , his wife and an old friend of Gilbert 's , was to sing the role of the Plaintiff , as part of a season of English opera that Rosa planned to present at the Drury Lane Theatre . Euphrosyne died in childbirth in 1874 , and the despondent Rosa dropped the project . Later in the same year , Gilbert offered the libretto to the impresario Richard D 'Oyly Carte , but Carte knew of no composer available to set it to music . 
 Meanwhile , Sullivan may have been considering a return to light opera : Cox and Box , his first comic opera , had received a London revival ( co @-@ starring his brother , Fred Sullivan ) in September 1874 . In November , Sullivan travelled to Paris and contacted Albert <unk> , one of the librettists for Jacques Offenbach 's operettas . However , he returned to London empty @-@ handed and worked on incidental music for the Gaiety Theatre 's production of The Merry Wives of Windsor . By early 1875 , Carte was managing Selina Dolaro 's Royalty Theatre , and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach 's La Périchole , which was to open on 30 January ( with Fred Sullivan in the cast ) , and in which Dolaro starred . Carte had asked Sullivan to compose something for the theatre and advertised in The Times in late January : " In Preparation , a New Comic Opera composed expressly for this theatre by Mr. Arthur Sullivan in which Madame Dolaro and Nellie Bromley will appear . " But around the same time , Carte also remembered Gilbert 's Trial by Jury and knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create Thespis . He suggested to Gilbert that Sullivan was the man to write the music for Trial . 
 Gilbert finally called on Sullivan and read the libretto to him on 20 February 1875 . Sullivan was enthusiastic , later recalling , " [ Gilbert ] read it through ... in the manner of a man considerably disappointed with what he had written . As soon as he had come to the last word , he closed up the manuscript violently , apparently unconscious of the fact that he had achieved his purpose so far as I was concerned , inasmuch as I was screaming with laughter the whole time . " Trial by Jury , described as " A Novel and Original Dramatic Cantata " in the original promotional material , was composed and rehearsed in a matter of weeks . 
 = = = Production and aftermath = = = 
 The result of Gilbert and Sullivan 's collaboration was a witty , tuneful and very " English " piece , in contrast to the bawdy burlesques and adaptations of French operettas that dominated the London musical stage at that time . 
 Initially , Trial by Jury , which runs only 30 minutes or so , was played last on a triple bill , on which the main attraction , La Périchole ( starring Dolaro as the title character , Fred Sullivan as Don Andres and Walter H. Fisher as <unk> ) , was preceded by the one @-@ act farce <unk> . The latter was immediately replaced by a series of other curtain raisers . Arthur Sullivan conducted the first night 's performance , and the theatre 's music director , B. Simmons , conducted thereafter . The composer 's brother , Fred Sullivan , starred as the Learned Judge , with Nellie Bromley as the Plaintiff . One of the choristers in Trial by Jury , W. S. Penley , was promoted in November 1875 to the small part of the Foreman of the Jury and made a strong impact on audiences with his amusing facial expressions and gestures . In March 1876 , he temporarily replaced Fred Sullivan as the Judge , when Fred 's health declined from tuberculosis . With this start , Penley went on to a successful career as comic actor , culminating with the lead role in the record @-@ breaking original production of Charley 's Aunt . Fred Sullivan died in January 1877 . 
 Jacques Offenbach 's works were then at the height of their popularity in Britain , but Trial by Jury proved even more popular than La Périchole , becoming an unexpected hit . Trial by Jury drew crowds and continued to run after La Périchole closed . While the Royalty Theatre closed for the summer in 1875 , Dolaro immediately took Trial on tour in England and Ireland . The piece resumed at the Royalty later in 1875 and was revived for additional London seasons in 1876 at the Opera Comique and in 1877 at the Strand Theatre . 
 Trial by Jury soon became the most desirable supporting piece for any London production , and , outside London , the major British theatrical touring companies had added it to their repertoire by about 1877 . The original production was even given a world tour by Opera Comique assistant manager Emily <unk> , which travelled as far as Australia . Unauthorised " pirate " productions quickly sprang up in America , taking advantage of the fact that American courts did not enforce foreign copyrights . It also became popular as part of the Victorian tradition of " benefit concerts " , where the theatrical community came together to raise money for actors and actresses down on their luck or retiring . The D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to play the work for a century , licensing the piece to amateur and foreign professional companies , such as the J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company . Since the copyrights to Gilbert and Sullivan works ran out in 1961 , the piece has been available to theatre companies around the world free of royalties . The work 's enduring popularity since 1875 makes it , according to theatrical scholar Kurt Gänzl , " probably the most successful British one @-@ act operetta of all time " . 
 The success of Trial by Jury spurred several attempts to reunite Gilbert and Sullivan , but difficulties arose . Plans for a collaboration for Carl Rosa in 1875 fell through because Gilbert was too busy with other projects , and an attempted Christmas 1875 revival of Thespis by Richard D 'Oyly Carte failed when the financiers backed out . Gilbert and Sullivan continued their separate careers , though both continued writing light opera , among other projects : Sullivan 's next light opera , The Zoo , opened while Trial by Jury was still playing , in June 1875 ; and Gilbert 's Eyes and No Eyes premièred a month later , followed by Princess Toto in 1876 . However , Gilbert and Sullivan would not be reunited until The Sorcerer in 1877 .

 The curtain rises on the Court of the Exchequer , where a jury and the public assemble to hear a case of breach of promise of marriage . 
 The Usher introduces the proceedings by exhorting the jury to listen to the broken @-@ hearted Plaintiff 's case but telling them that they " needn 't mind " what the " <unk> defendant " has to say . He adds , however , that " From bias free of every kind , this trial must be tried ! " The Defendant ( Edwin ) arrives , and the jurymen greet him with hostility , even though , as he points out , they have as yet no idea of the merits of his case . He tells them , with surprising candour , that he jilted the Plaintiff because she became a " bore intense " to him , and he then quickly took up with another woman . The jurymen recall their own wayward youth , but they are now respectable gentlemen and no longer have any sympathy for the Defendant . 
 The Judge enters with great pomp and describes how he rose to his position – by courting a rich attorney 's " elderly , ugly daughter " . The rich attorney then aided his prospective son @-@ in @-@ law 's legal career until " at length I became as rich as the <unk> " and " threw over " the daughter . The jury and public are delighted with the judge , and ignore that he has just admitted to the same wrong of which the Defendant is accused . 
 The jury is then sworn in , and the Plaintiff ( Angelina ) is summoned . She is preceded into the courtroom by her bridesmaids , one of whom catches the eye of the judge . However , when Angelina herself arrives in full wedding dress , she instantly captures the heart of both Judge and jury . The Counsel for the Plaintiff makes a moving speech detailing Edwin 's betrayal . Angelina feigns distress and staggers , first into the arms of the Foreman of the Jury , and then of the Judge . Edwin counters , explaining that his change of heart is only natural : 
 He offers to marry both the Plaintiff and his new love , if that would satisfy everyone . The Judge at first finds this " a reasonable proposition " , but the Counsel argues that from the days of James II , it has been " a rather serious crime / To marry two wives at a time " ( humorously , he labels the crime in question " burglary " rather than " bigamy " ) . Perplexed , everyone in court ponders the " nice dilemma " in a parody of Italian opera ensembles . 
 Angelina desperately embraces Edwin , demonstrating the depth of her love , and bemoans her loss – all in evidence of the large amount of damages that the jury should force Edwin to pay . Edwin , in turn , says he is a smoker , a drunkard , and a bully ( when tipsy ) , and that the Plaintiff could not have endured him even for a day ; thus the damages should be small . The Judge suggests making Edwin tipsy to see if he would really " thrash and kick " Angelina , but everyone else ( except Edwin ) objects to this experiment . Impatient at the lack of progress , the Judge resolves the case by offering to marry Angelina himself . This is found quite satisfactory , and the opera is concluded with " joy unbounded " .

 Reviews of the first performance of Trial by Jury were uniformly glowing . Fun magazine declared the opera " extremely funny and admirably composed " , while rival Punch magazine wrote that it " is the funniest bit of nonsense your representative has seen for a considerable time " , only regretting that it was too short . The Daily News praised the author : " In whimsical invention and eccentric humour Mr. W. S. Gilbert has no living rival among our dramatic writers , and never has his peculiar vein of drollery and satire been more conspicuous than in a little piece entitled Trial by Jury " . The Daily Telegraph concluded that the piece illustrated the composer 's " great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class " . Many critics emphasised the happy combination of Gilbert 's words and Sullivan 's music . One noted that " so completely is each imbued with the same spirit , that it would be as difficult to conceive the existence of Mr. Gilbert 's verses without Mr. Sullivan 's music , as of Mr. Sullivan 's music without Mr. Gilbert 's verses . Each gives each a double charm . " Another agreed that " it seems , as in the great Wagnerian operas , as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain . " 
 The opening night audience was also delighted by the piece , preferring it even to the Offenbach work : " To judge by the unceasing and almost boisterous hilarity which formed a sort of running commentary on the part of the audience , Trial by Jury suffered nothing whatever from so dangerous a juxtaposition [ with a piece by the popular Offenbach ] . On the contrary , it may fairly be said to have borne away the palm . " A reviewer noted that " Laughter more frequent or more hearty was never heard in any theatre than that which more than once brought the action ... to a temporary standstill . " Another paper summed up its popular appeal : " Trial by Jury is but a trifle – it pretends to be nothing more – but it is one of those merry bits of extravagance which a great many will go to see and hear , which they will laugh at , and which they will advise their friends to go and see , and therefore its success cannot be doubtful . " 
 Among the actors , special critical praise was reserved for the composer 's brother , Fred Sullivan , in the role of the Learned Judge : " The greatest ' hit ' was made by Mr. F. Sullivan , whose blending of official dignity , condescension , and , at the right moment , extravagant humour , made the character of the Judge stand out with all requisite prominence , and added much to the interest of the piece . " The Times concurred that his portrayal deserved " a special word of praise for its quiet and natural humour . " Nelly Bromley ( the Plaintiff ) , Walter H. Fisher ( the Defendant ) , John Hollingsworth ( the Counsel ) and others were also praised for their acting . 
 Later assessments of the work have been no less positive . In 1907 , Gilbert 's first biographer , Edith A. Browne , concluded : " In Trial by Jury we find author and composer looking at the humorous side of life from exactly the same point of view , and we at once realise how Gilbert and Sullivan have been able to do for Comic Opera what Wagner has done for Grand Opera by combining words and music so as to make them one . " H. M. Walbrook similarly wrote in 1922 : 
 Trial by Jury ... satirizes the procedure in an average breach of promise , and also the insincerity which may sometimes underlie the pose of " respectability . " Everything done or sung is ludicrous , and yet beneath it all lies a recognisable substratum of truth . The piece is a riot of laughter . The Judge 's ditty , " When first , my friends , I was called to the Bar , " [ sic ] is the best @-@ known comic song in the English language . In none of the operas is the genius of Gilbert as an inventor of " comic business " more daringly and irresistibly exhibited . One can see the piece again and again and discover fresh strokes of <unk> . Its place in the Gilbert and Sullivan repertory is as secure as ever ; and whatever reforms may be hereafter effected in this particular department of the King 's Bench Division , Trial by Jury will probably long continue to be one of the English @-@ speaking world 's refreshments . 
 Gilbert and Sullivan biographer Michael <unk> , writing in 2002 , 127 years after the premiere of the opera , explained its enduring appeal : " Nothing could be more serious than a court of law ... and now the world had been turned upside down . The court of law had become the scene of humor and frivolity ; the learned judge had shown himself to be as fickle as the defendant , and the justice system turned out to be flawed by human frailty . And Sullivan had grasped the joke .... From the first chords ... Sullivan ’ s music sets the scene of mock @-@ seriousness and proceeds to dance its way through the whole piece . "

 As the first Savoy opera , Trial by Jury marked an important moment in the history of the Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration , as well as in the careers of each of the two men and in Victorian drama in general . Historian Reginald Allen sums up the historical import of the opera : 
 Most scholars of the Victorian theatre date the birth of Gilbert & Sullivan opera with the first performance of Trial by Jury .... Some will maintain that there is no single date of comparable importance in the history of the modern lyric theatre than this occasion which first brought together the triumvirate of W. S. Gilbert , Arthur Sullivan , and their catalyst business genius , Richard D 'Oyly Carte . The next twenty @-@ five years witnessed the spectacular , worldwide success of this collaboration : the Gilbert & Sullivan operas , initiated by Trial by Jury . Without this spark , who can say that any of the instantaneous hits of G [ <unk> ] & S [ <unk> ] that followed would ever have been written ? 
 Sidney Dark and Rowland Grey also give a high value to the importance of Trial by Jury and the operas that followed : " There is not a little historical interest in the genesis of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas , the one English contribution of any value to dramatic literature for many generations . " In addition , references to the opera continue today in the popular media and even in law cases . 
 = = = Pattern for later Savoy operas = = = 
 Trial by Jury is the only Gilbert and Sullivan opera played in one act and the only theatrical work by W. S. Gilbert without spoken dialogue . However , later Gilbert and Sullivan operas retained a number of patterns seen in Trial . For example , all except for The Yeomen of the Guard begin with a chorus number . Also , like Trial by Jury , the later operas generally end with a relatively short finale consisting of a chorus number interspersed with short solos by the principal characters . " Comes the broken flower " ( part of No. 3 ) was the first in a string of meditative " Horatian " lyrics , " mingling happiness and sadness , an acceptance and a smiling resignation " . These would , from this point forward , allow the characters , in each of the Savoy operas , an introspective scene where they stop and consider life , in contrast to the foolishness of the surrounding scenes . Like both of the tenor 's arias in Trial by Jury , tenor arias in later Savoy operas were set in 6 / 8 time so frequently that comedian Anna Russell , in her 1953 parody , " How to Write Your Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera " , exclaimed , " the tenor ... according to tradition , must sing an aria in 6 / 8 time , usually accompanying himself on a stringed instrument " . In Trial by Jury hypocrisy is revealed as the characters ' motivations are held up to satire , and Gilbert mocks the underlying absurdity of the judicial procedures . As Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther explains , Gilbert combines his criticisms with comic entertainment , which renders them more palatable , while at the same time underlining their truth : " By laughing at a joke you show that you accept its premise . " This too would become characteristic of Gilbert 's work . 
 The judge 's song , " When I , good friends , was called to the Bar " was followed by a string of similar patter songs that would come to epitomise Gilbert and Sullivan 's collaboration . In these , often , a " dignified personage [ would , just like the Judge , ] supply a humorous biography of himself . " Just as in Gilbert 's earlier play , The Palace of Truth , in these songs , the characters " naïvely reveal their innermost thoughts , unconscious of their egotism , vanity , baseness , or cruelty " . Crowther points out that such revelations work particularly well in Trial by Jury , because people commonly expect " characters singing in opera / operetta will communicate at a deeper level of truth than they would in mere speech . " In " When I , good friends " , the judge outlines the path of corruption that led to his becoming a judge , and this , too , would set the pattern for many of the patter songs in Gilbert and Sullivan operas to follow . 
 One of Gilbert 's most notable innovations , first found in Thespis and repeated in Trial by Jury and all of the later Savoy operas , is the use of the chorus as an essential part of the action . In most earlier operas , burlesques , and comedies , the chorus had very little impact on the plot and served mainly as " noise or ornament " . In the Gilbert and Sullivan operas , however , the chorus is essential , taking part in the action and often acting as an important character in its own right . Sullivan recalled , " Until Gilbert took the matter in hand choruses were dummy concerns , and were practically nothing more than a part of the stage setting . It was in ' Thespis ' that Gilbert began to carry out his expressed determination to get the chorus to play its proper part in the performance . At this moment it seems difficult to realise that the idea of the chorus being anything more than a sort of stage audience was , at that time , a tremendous novelty . " Another Gilbert innovation , following the example of his mentor , T. W. Robertson , was that the costumes and sets were made as realistic as possible : Gilbert based the scenery for the production on the Clerkenwell Sessions House , where he had practised law in the 1860s . The costumes were contemporary , and Angelina and her bridesmaids were dressed in real wedding attire . This attention to detail and careful creation of realistic sets and scenes were typical of Gilbert 's stage management and would be repeated in all of Gilbert 's work . For instance , when preparing the sets for H.M.S. Pinafore ( 1878 ) , Gilbert and Sullivan visited Portsmouth to inspect ships . Gilbert made sketches of H.M.S. Victory and H.M.S. St Vincent and created a model set for the carpenters to work from . This was far from standard procedure in Victorian drama , where naturalism was still a relatively new concept , and where most authors had very little influence on how their plays and libretti were staged . 
 = = = Analysis = = = 
 Andrew Crowther places Trial by Jury at the centre of Gilbert 's development as a librettist . He notes that in some of Gilbert 's early libretti , such as Topsyturveydom ( 1874 ) , the songs simply emphasise the dialogue . In others , such as Thespis ( 1871 ) , some songs are relatively disconnected from both the story and characterisation , such as " I once knew a chap " or " Little maid of Arcadee " , which simply convey a moral lesson . In Trial by Jury , however , each song carries the plot forward and adds depth to the characters . In addition , unlike some of Gilbert 's more fantastical early plots , " Aside from the ending , nothing essentially improbable happens . " Theatre historian Kurt Gänzl agrees , writing that " Gilbert 's libretto was superior to any of his previous efforts . It was concise , modern and satirical without being impossibly whimsical . Having no spoken dialogue it was perforce tightly constructed and allowed of no interpolation or alteration . " Sullivan 's development as a comic opera writer , too , would mature with Trial by Jury . Except for incidental music for productions of Shakespeare , he had not written any music for the stage since Thespis . Gänzl wrote that Trial by Jury " brought Sullivan firmly and finally into the world of the musical " stage and confirmed , after his previous success with Cox and Box and Thespis , that " Sullivan was a composer of light lyric and comic music who could rival Offenbach , Lecocq and any English musician alive . " 
 Sullivan used the opportunities suggested by Gilbert 's satire of the pomp and ceremony of the law to provide a variety of musical jokes . " From the first chords ... Sullivan 's music sets the scene of mock @-@ seriousness .... His ... humorous use of the orchestra runs throughout " . For example , <unk> the plaintiff 's calculated swooning in " That she is reeling is plain to see ! " ( No. 9 ) with a reeling , minor @-@ key theme in the string accompaniment , heading up and down the octaves . The instruments are also used to comically set the scene ; for instance , he underlines the Counsel 's misstatement in the line " To marry two at once is <unk> " with a comic bassoon " sting " in octaves and has the Defendant tune his guitar on stage ( simulated by a violin in the orchestra ) in the opening to his song . 
 The score also contains two parodies or pastiches of other composers : No. 3 , " All hail great Judge " is an elaborate parody of Handel 's fugues , and No. 12 , " A nice dilemma " , parodies " dilemma " ensembles of Italian opera in the Bel canto era ; in particular " D 'un pensiero " from Act I of Bellini 's La sonnambula . " A nice dilemma " uses the dominant rhythm and key of " D 'un pensiero " and divides up some of the choral lines between the basses and higher voices to create an oom @-@ pa @-@ pa effect common in Italian opera choruses . 
 = = Productions = = 
 After the premiere of Trial by Jury in 1875 , operetta companies in London , the British provinces and elsewhere picked it up rapidly , usually playing it as a <unk> or an afterpiece to a French operetta . The first American productions were at the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia on 22 October 1875 and the Eagle Theatre in New York City on 15 November 1875 . The world tour of the original British production took it to America , Australia , and elsewhere . It was even translated into German , and premièred as Im <unk> , at the Carltheater on 14 September 1886 , and as Das <unk> vor Gericht at <unk> 's Orpheum on 5 October 1901 . 
 Richard D 'Oyly Carte 's opera companies ( of which there were often several playing simultaneously ) usually programmed Trial by Jury as a companion piece to The Sorcerer or H.M.S. Pinafore . In the 1884 – 85 London production , a transformation scene was added at the end , in which the Judge and Plaintiff became the Harlequinade characters Harlequin and Columbine and the set was consumed by red fire and flames . From 1894 , the year when the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company established a year @-@ round touring company that had most of the Gilbert and Sullivan works in its repertory , Trial by Jury was always included , except for 1901 – 03 , and then again from 1943 – 46 , when the company played a reduced repertory during World War II . From 1919 , costumes were by Percy Anderson , and a new touring set was designed by Peter Goffin in 1957 . 
 During the company 's 1975 centennial performances of all thirteen Gilbert and Sullivan Operas at the Savoy Theatre , Trial was given four times , as a curtain raiser to The Sorcerer , Pinafore and Pirates and as an afterpiece following The Grand Duke . Before the first of the four performances of Trial , a specially written curtain raiser by William Douglas @-@ Home , called Dramatic Licence , was played by Peter Pratt as Carte , Kenneth Sandford as Gilbert and John <unk> as Sullivan , in which Gilbert , Sullivan and Carte plan the birth of Trial in 1875 . Trial by Jury was eliminated from the D 'Oyly Carte repertory in 1976 as a cost @-@ saving measure .

 The following table summarises the main London productions of Trial by Jury up to the time of Sullivan 's death in 1900 : 
 The exclusive performing rights to Trial by Jury and the other Gilbert and Sullivan operas were held by the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company until their expiration in 1961 , 50 years after Gilbert 's death , and no other professional company was authorised to present the Savoy operas in Britain from 1877 until that date . The following tables show the casts of the principal original D 'Oyly Carte productions and touring companies at approximately 10 @-@ year intervals through to the 1975 centenary season . 
 = = Benefit performances = = 
 Starting in 1877 , Trial by Jury was often given at benefit performances , usually for an actor or actress who had fallen on hard times , but occasionally for other causes . These were glittering affairs , with various celebrities appearing in principal roles or as part of the chorus . Gilbert himself played the silent role of the Associate on at least four occasions . 
 Arthur Sullivan conducted the 1877 benefit for actor Henry Compton . At the Compton benefit , Penley and George Grossmith were members of the Jury , and a number of other famous actors and actresses were in the chorus . Sullivan also conducted the 1889 benefit for Barrington . 
 At the Nellie Farren benefit , many of the performers listed below sat in the jury or the gallery , and Trial by Jury was followed by a six @-@ hour @-@ long concert . Performances were given by Henry Irving , Ellaline Terriss , Marie Tempest , Hayden Coffin , Arthur Roberts , Letty Lind , Edmund Payne and many others . 
 The Ellen Terry benefit in 1906 was also a particularly well @-@ attended affair , with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle numbered among the jury and Enrico Caruso singing , among many star performances . 
 <unk> role of the Associate 's Wife was especially created for the disabled soldiers ' benefit performance and does not appear in any standard performances . 
 = = Recordings = = 
 Trial by Jury has been recorded many times . Of the recordings by the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company , those recorded in 1927 and 1964 are ranked the best , according to the " Gilbert and Sullivan Discography " , edited by Marc Shepherd . The 1961 Sargent and especially the 1995 Mackerras recordings are also rated highly by the Discography . Reviewer Michael Walters gives his highest praise to the 1924 recording , but he also likes the 1961 recording . 
 The Discography recommends the 1982 Brent Walker video , which is paired with Cox and Box . More recent professional productions have been recorded on video by the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival .

 = = Textual changes = = 
 Before the first performance of Trial by Jury , some material was cut , including two songs and a recitative : a song for the foreman of the jury , " Oh , do not blush to shed a tear " , which was to be sung just after " Oh , will you swear by yonder skies " ; and a recitative for the Judge and song for the Usher , " We do not deal with artificial crime " and " His lordship 's always quits " , which came just before " A nice dilemma " . The melody for " His Lordship 's always quits " is known , and it was reused in " I loved her fondly " in The Zoo and later modified into the main tune from " A wand 'ring minstrel , I " in The Mikado . A few changes were made to the end of " I love him , I love him ! " after the first night . A third verse for " Oh , gentlemen , listen I pray " was sung , at least on the first night , and part was quoted in a review in the Pictorial World . 
 Trial by Jury underwent relatively minor textual changes after its first run , mainly consisting of insignificant amendments to wording . The most significant changes involve the ending . The original stage directions set up a simple pantomime @-@ style tableau : 
 Judge and Plaintiff dance back , hornpipe step , and get on to the Bench – the Bridesmaids take the eight garlands of roses from behind the Judge 's desk and draw them across floor of court , so that they radiate from the desk . Two plaster Cupids in bar wigs descend from flies . Red fire . 
 This became much more elaborate in the 1884 revival , with the entire set being transformed , and the plaintiff climbing onto the Judge 's back " à la fairy " . However , in the 1920s , the plaster cupids were evidently damaged on a tour , and the transformation scene was abandoned completely . 
 = 2015 Hungarian Grand Prix = 
 The 2015 Hungarian Grand Prix ( formally the Formula 1 Pirelli Magyar Nagydíj 2015 ) was a Formula One motor race that took place on 26 July 2015 at the Hungaroring in Mogyoród , Hungary . It was the tenth round of the 2015 Formula One season and the 30th Hungarian Grand Prix . 
 Daniel Ricciardo of Red Bull was the defending race winner , while Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes came into the race with a 17 @-@ point lead over teammate Nico Rosberg . During Saturday 's qualifying , Hamilton took his ninth pole position of the season in only the tenth race , ahead of Rosberg . 
 At the start of the race the two Ferrari drivers Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen took first and second respectively from the Mercedes ; the first win for Ferrari in Hungary since 2004 . An eventful race saw a safety car period and several mistakes from both Mercedes drivers , leading to Hamilton and Rosberg finishing sixth and eighth , while the two Red Bull drivers scored the team 's first podium positions of the season . As a result , Hamilton extended his lead over Rosberg to 21 points , while Vettel moved closer to the pair , another 21 points behind Rosberg .

 The Hungarian Grand Prix marked the first Formula One race after the passing of former Marussia driver Jules Bianchi on 17 July 2015 , who had crashed at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix and remained in a coma for nine months . Drivers and teams paid tribute to Bianchi , many of them in the form of messages written on helmets and cars . A minute of silence was held before the race start on Sunday in commemoration of Bianchi . The drivers , and members of the Bianchi family ( parents and siblings ) , linked in a chain arm in arm , with their helmets surrounding Jules ' in the middle . 
 Tyre supplier Pirelli opted to bring the yellow @-@ marked soft and white @-@ marked medium tyres to the Hungaroring , the same choice as the year before . Minor changes were made to the track , renewing catch fences and tyre barriers , while removing the higher curb at the apex of turn 6 in order to prevent the cars from lifting off the ground . Generally , the track is considered to be one of the slowest in the calendar , with the fourteen corners and few straights making it hard to overtake . 
 Going into the weekend , Lewis Hamilton was leading the drivers ' championship with 194 points , 17 more than his closest rival and teammate Nico Rosberg . Third placed Sebastian Vettel was another 42 points behind , followed by Valtteri Bottas on 77 points . In the constructors ' standings , Mercedes was leading on 371 , followed by Ferrari with 211 points , and Williams a further 60 points behind . 
 = = = Free practice = = = 
 Per the regulations for the 2015 season , three practice sessions were held , two 1 @.@ 5 @-@ hour sessions on Friday and another one @-@ hour session before qualifying on Saturday . Lewis Hamilton was fastest in the first practice session on Friday morning , one @-@ tenth of a second faster than teammate Nico Rosberg . Sebastian Vettel missed the first half @-@ hour of practice due to electrical problems on his Ferrari SF15 @-@ T. He eventually was sixth quickest , 1 @.@ 254 seconds down on Hamilton . The session was red @-@ flagged around the hour mark , when Sergio Pérez crashed heavily in turn 11 . Going into the right @-@ hand corner , he lost the rear and spun into the barrier , breaking off his right front wheel . The wheel caused the Force India to flip over when the car bounced back to the track . After the car came to a rest upside down , Pérez was quick to inform his team that he was unharmed . Racing resumed fifteen minutes later , only to be interrupted once more when Kimi Räikkönen 's front wing came off in turn 12 , leaving debris on the track . Räikkönen ultimately finished the session in third place , having put in his fastest lap before the incident . Meanwhile , the Red Bull drivers finished fourth and fifth . Valtteri Bottas in the Williams , using a new front wing , finished ninth , six @-@ tenths of a second quicker than teammate Felipe Massa . Stating satisfaction with the new part , he opted to use it for the remainder of the weekend . While Jolyon Palmer replaced Romain Grosjean during first free practice , as he had done in previous race weekends , 2013 GP2 Series champion Fabio <unk> took part in his first Formula One session , replacing Roberto Merhi at Manor . 
 Following the crash for Pérez , Force India opted not to run in the second practice session in order to have time to investigate the causes . Hamilton again topped the timesheets , this time leading the two Red Bulls , with Rosberg down in fourth . However , it was not a trouble @-@ free session for Red Bull , as Daniel Ricciardo had to stop his car due to engine problems twenty minutes before the end of the session , bringing out another red flag . McLaren , which had a troublesome season so far , proved to be more competitive , with Jenson Button saying that the car " felt good " and that he hoped to qualify the car in the top ten . His teammate Fernando Alonso finished the second practice session eighth fastest , while Button himself was twelfth . 
 After making modifications to their suspension , Force India was cleared by the stewards to take part in the third and last practice session on Saturday morning . Lewis Hamilton was once again quickest , but this time with teammate Nico Rosberg less than a tenth of a second behind him in second place . Sebastian Vettel in third was the only other driver to come within a second of Hamilton 's time . While Daniil Kvyat was next @-@ fastest in fourth , McLaren confirmed their improved pace by finishing the session eighth and thirteenth . The second Ferrari of Räikkönen was confined to sixteenth place , after a water leak on his car prevented him from doing fast laps on the softer tyre compound . 
 = = = Qualifying = = = 
 Qualifying consisted of three parts , 18 , 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively , with five drivers eliminated from competing after each of the first two sessions . Despite hopes for a top ten starting position , Jenson Button was eliminated during the first part of qualifying ( Q1 ) , along with both Saubers and the two Manors . The only driver to risk not using the soft tyre compound , which provided up to two seconds advantage , was Daniel Ricciardo , who finished the first part twelfth . 
 Fernando Alonso , the only McLaren to have made it into Q2 , stopped on track due to his engine shutting down close to pit entry , bringing out a red flag . He pushed the car back into the pit garage , aided by numerous track marshals , only to be disallowed to drive out again due to regulations . Nico Rosberg , who complained about the handling of his car all through qualifying , was about half a second off his teammate 's pace in Q2 in second position . Meanwhile , Pastor Maldonado and Carlos Sainz , Jr. joined Alonso on the sidelines as they were eliminated , as were both Force Indias . 
 The top ten competed for pole position in the final part of qualifying . Lewis Hamilton continued his impressive performance by setting what he considered " probably the most dominant " pole of his career , having led every practice and qualifying session . Daniel Ricciardo produced a clean lap to qualify between the two Ferraris in fourth place , behind Sebastian Vettel . Behind them , Bottas edged out Daniil Kvyat for sixth , while the second Williams of Felipe Massa qualified eighth on the grid . 
 Hamilton was delighted with his performance , saying : " I 'm incredibly happy with the weekend [ ... ] I can 't remember having a performance as good as this . " His teammate Rosberg however lamented his poor performance . While he beat Hamilton on number of pole positions the previous year , he now trailed him by 0 @.@ 262 seconds on average in qualifying , prompting him to say : " It is not explainable to me . [ ... ] I don 't understand why there is such a big difference to last year . " 
 = = = Race = = = 
 Felipe Massa lined up incorrectly on the grid , causing the start to be aborted and another formation lap to commence . One lap was removed from the race distance and Massa was handed a five @-@ second penalty . 
 At the start , Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen gained the lead off the two Mercedes drivers , taking advantage of the slower starts from Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton . Hamilton ran wide and cut the chicane at turn six and dropped to tenth place . Further back , Nico Hülkenberg made up six places in the opening corners , jumping from eleventh to fifth , while Bottas and Ricciardo touched at the start , sending Ricciardo back to seventh while Bottas led Hülkenberg in fourth place . During the opening laps , Felipe Massa was able to hold Hamilton behind him , while Daniil Kvyat led his teammate Ricciardo through into sixth place on lap eight . Lap ten saw Hamilton overtake Massa for ninth , while Ricciardo edged out Hülkenberg for fifth position . Three laps later , Hamilton moved past Pérez for eighth . 
 Pit stops started on lap 14 , when Bottas and Ricciardo were the first to come in , with Massa following suit a lap later , taking his five @-@ second penalty . By lap 18 , the two Ferraris in front were unchallenged by Rosberg behind . Sebastian Vettel set a new fastest lap , being 2 @.@ 7 seconds in front of his teammate , who was a further seven seconds ahead of Rosberg in third . Räikkönen lost one of his front cameras on lap 19 , but did not opt to change his front wing . The same lap , Pastor Maldonado and Sergio Pérez touched going into turn one , with Pérez spinning in the process but being able to continue . Maldonado however was handed a drive @-@ through penalty for causing the collision . 
 When Lewis Hamilton came into the pits on lap 20 , he emerged slightly in front of Valtteri Bottas in fifth place . Rosberg pitted for new tyres one lap later , choosing the harder medium compound . The two Ferraris and Daniel Ricciardo followed in the subsequent lap , staying ahead of Rosberg and Hamilton respectively . Meanwhile , Romain Grosjean became the second Lotus driver to be penalised , receiving a five @-@ second penalty for an unsafe release from his pit box . Hamilton was behind Ricciardo in fifth place at this point , who was running the harder compound tyres , eventually passing him on lap 29 . By lap 33 , Vettel in front was leading teammate Räikkönen by seven seconds , with Rosberg a further twenty seconds adrift . Meanwhile , Hamilton started to gain on his teammate , setting fastest laps to trail him by eight seconds on lap 36 . 
 By lap 42 , Kimi Räikkönen started to experience engine problems which turned out to be an issue with his kinetic electrical unit . This led to a loss in power which allowed the lapped Fernando Alonso to overtake him and Nico Rosberg to close in as well . One lap later , Nico Hülkenberg lost his front wing without evident reason . After the race , the kerbs of the Hungaroring were blamed for the malfunction , which sent Hülkenberg into the tyre barriers in turn one . The Virtual Safety Car was deployed , leading to both Mercedes cars pitting instantly , while both Ferraris did the same one lap later . By that time , the actual safety car was sent out on track to lead the field through the pit lane while marshals cleaned up pieces of Hülkenberg 's front wing that littered the front straight , leading the field until the end of lap 49 . 
 At the restart , Lewis Hamilton came under pressure from Daniel Ricciardo and both cars touched and took damage in turn one , handing Ricciardo the position . Hamilton was given a drive @-@ through penalty for his actions . Meanwhile , Rosberg easily took second place from the troubled Räikkönen , who lost one more spot to Ricciardo just shortly after . Further back , Max Verstappen ran into the back of Bottas , causing Bottas to lose ground while Verstappen moved up to seventh . Nico Rosberg started to gain time on Sebastian Vettel in front , trailing him by 1 @.@ 2 seconds with 18 laps to go . Kimi Räikkönen went into the pits on lap 53 and reset his engine , only to retire for good on lap 57 . Sainz joined him three laps later with a fuel pressure issue . Pastor Maldonado was handed two more penalties in the following laps , for speeding in the pit lane and for overtaking behind the safety car . Max Verstappen was also reprimanded with a drive @-@ through penalty for failing " to stay above the required time set by the FIA ECU during the deployment of the safety car " . 
 By lap 63 , three drivers were contending for the race victory . Sebastian Vettel was leading compatriot Rosberg by 0 @.@ 8 seconds with Daniel Ricciardo another 0 @.@ 7 seconds behind . Meanwhile , Hamilton made up ground and overtook Ericsson and Button to move into eighth place . When Ricciardo tried to overtake Rosberg one lap later , the two collided , clipping the Red Bull 's front wing and giving Rosberg a puncture . Both headed to the pits , with Ricciardo emerging third , while Rosberg fell back behind Hamilton . Even though Daniil Kvyat was handed a ten @-@ second time penalty for leaving track limits , he held on to second place for his first Formula One podium finish . Lewis Hamilton went past Romain Grosjean for sixth place on lap 67 , closing on Fernando Alonso , but was eventually unable to catch him , who scored McLaren 's best finish of the season up to that point . The race was also Honda 's 350th Grand Prix as an engine supplier and the first time that the renewed partnership with McLaren scored a double points finish . 
 By winning his first Hungarian Grand Prix , and 41st Grand Prix overall , Vettel matched Ayrton Senna for third @-@ most Formula One career wins . It was Ferrari 's first win at the track since Michael Schumacher won in 2004 . It was the first time since the 2013 Brazilian Grand Prix that any of the factory Mercedes cars failed to finish on the podium .

 Sebastian Vettel dedicated his victory to Jules Bianchi , saying over the team radio on his way back to the pits : " Merci Jules , you will always be in our hearts and we know that sooner or later you would have been part of this team ! " During the podium interviews , conducted by German TV presenter Kai <unk> , he went on to say : " Incredible day but this victory is for Jules . We know that it has been an incredibly tough week and it 's , I think , for all of us very , very difficult , so this one is for him [ ... ] . " Daniil Kvyat stated that the team deserved the podium finish after " a very tough year " . Daniel Ricciardo described it as " a crazy race " , but said that " that 's the way Jules would have wanted it " . 
 Media reactions to the race were very positive , with The Guardian calling it " heart @-@ stopper of a race " , while the BBC spoke of a " classic " race . Lewis Hamilton apologised for " a really bad performance from me " . He continued : " I don 't know if it was a lack of concentration or what . I pushed right to the end but there were so many obstacles . It 's like there were two different directions and each time I chose the wrong one . " Fernando Alonso hailed his fifth @-@ place finish as " unbelievable " , but stressed that the result was " a present " , stating : " at the moment we are not super @-@ competitive " . 
 Several drivers received penalty points on their Super Licences , including Hamilton , who was given his first two for his collision with Ricciardo at the safety car restart . Romain Grosjean added two points to get to six over the course of the season for the unsafe release . His teammate Pastor Maldonado was handed two points as well for his accident with Pérez , bringing him to six over a course of two months . Concerning the incident between Rosberg and Ricciardo , no further action was taken . The stewards came to the same verdict concerning the Verstappen – Bottas incident , saying that Verstappen " took reasonable actions to avoid contact " , however he did receive three penalty points , bringing his total to five , for speeding behind the safety car .
