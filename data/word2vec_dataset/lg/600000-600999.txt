 = Battle of Apamea = 
 The Battle of Apamea was fought on 19 July 998 between the forces of the Byzantine Empire and the Fatimid Caliphate . The battle was part of a series of military confrontations between the two powers over control of northern Syria and the Hamdanid emirate of Aleppo . The Byzantine regional commander , Damian Dalassenos , had been besieging Apamea , until the arrival of the Fatimid relief army from Damascus , under Jaysh ibn Samsama . In the subsequent battle , the Byzantines were initially victorious , but a lone Kurdish rider managed to kill Dalassenos , throwing the Byzantine army into panic . The fleeing Byzantines were then pursued , with much loss of life , by the Fatimid troops . This defeat forced the Byzantine emperor Basil II to personally campaign in the region the next year , and was followed in 1001 by the conclusion of a ten @-@ year truce between the two states . 
 = = Background = = 
 In September 994 Michael Bourtzes , the Byzantine military governor ( doux ) of Antioch and northern Syria , suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of the Orontes at the hands of the Fatimid general Manjutakin . This Fatimid victory shook the Byzantine position in Syria , and posed a grave threat to its Arab vassal , the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo . To prevent its fall , Emperor Basil II himself intervened in the region in 995 , forcing Manjutakin to retire to Damascus . After capturing Shayzar , Hims and Rafaniya , and building a new fortress at <unk> , the emperor withdrew , leaving Damian Dalassenos as the new doux of Antioch . 
 Dalassenos maintained an aggressive stance . In 996 his forces raided the environs of Tripoli and Arqa , while Manjutakin , again without success , laid siege to Aleppo and <unk> , but was forced to withdraw when Dalassenos with his army came to relieve the fortress . The next year , Dalassenos repeated his raids against Tripoli , Rafaniya , <unk> , and al @-@ <unk> , capturing the latter . At the same time , the inhabitants of Tyre , under the leadership of a sailor named <unk> , rose up in revolt against the Fatimids and requested Byzantine assistance ; further south , in Palestine , the Bedouin leader Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al @-@ Jarrah attacked Ramlah . 
 = = Siege of Apamea and the Fatimid relief expedition = = 
 In early summer 998 , Dalassenos learned that a catastrophic fire had broken out in Apamea and destroyed most of its provisions , so he marched towards the city . The Aleppines too endeavoured to seize Apamea and arrived there first , but withdrew at the approach of Dalassenos , who could not permit a vassal to grow too strong and intended to capture the town for the emperor . Although ostensibly allies with the Byzantines , the Aleppines left the provisions they had brought with them to be collected by the inhabitants of Apamea , aiding them in their resistance . Subsequent events are presented by several authors , including the brief narrative of John Skylitzes and the more extensive accounts of the Christian Arab Yahya of Antioch and the Armenian Stephen of Taron . Arab accounts also survive , all apparently drawing upon the work of the 11th @-@ century historian Hilal al @-@ Sabi ; the most detailed version is preserved by Ibn al @-@ Qalanisi . 
 The governor of Apamea , al @-@ Mala <unk> , called for aid upon the Fatimids . According to Ibn al @-@ Qalanisi , the eunuch regent <unk> appointed Jaysh ibn Samsama to command the relief army , naming him governor of Damascus and giving him a thousand men . Before confronting the Byzantines , the Fatimids had to deal with the revolt of Tyre and the rebellion of Ibn al @-@ Jarrah . The Byzantines attempted to aid the besieged at Tyre by sending a fleet , but it was beaten off by the Fatimids , and the city captured in June 998 . Ibn al @-@ Jarrah 's revolt was also suppressed , and Jaysh ibn Samsama returned to Damascus , where he stayed for three days to gather his forces for the relief of Apamea . There he was joined by the troops and volunteers from Tripoli , assembling a force numbering 10 @,@ 000 men and 1 @,@ 000 Bedouin riders of the Banu Kilab tribe . According to Skylitzes , the Fatimid army comprised the forces of Tripoli , Beirut , Tyre , and Damascus . Meanwhile , Dalassenos was vigorously pursuing the siege , and the inhabitants of Apamea had been reduced to famine , being forced to eat cadavers and dogs , which they bought for the price of 25 silver dirhams ( according to Abu 'l @-@ Faraj , two gold dinars ) a piece .

 The two armies met on the large plain of al @-@ <unk> ( cf . <unk> al @-@ <unk> ) , surrounded by mountains and located near the Lake of Apamea , on 19 July 998 . According to Ibn al @-@ Qalanisi , the Fatimid army 's left wing was commanded by <unk> the Slav , governor of Tripoli ; the centre , where the Daylamite infantry and the army baggage train were located , was under the command of Badr al @-@ Attar ; the right was commanded by Jaysh ibn Samsama and Wahid al @-@ Hilali . According to all accounts , the Byzantines charged the Fatimid army and drove it to flight , killing some 2 @,@ 000 and capturing the baggage train . Only 500 ghilman under Bishara the Ikhshidid remained steadfast and held firm against the assault , while the Banu Kilab simply abandoned the fight and began looting the battlefield . At that point , a Kurdish rider , named Abu 'l @-@ Hajar Ahmad ibn al @-@ Dahhak al @-@ Salil by Ibn al @-@ Athir and Ibn al @-@ Qalanisi and Bar <unk> by the Byzantine sources and Abu 'l @-@ Faraj , rode towards Dalassenos , who was near his battle standard on top of a height and was accompanied only by two of his sons and ten men of his retinue . Believing the battle won and that the Kurd wanted to surrender , Dalassenos took no precautions . As he approached the Byzantine general , Ibn al @-@ Dahhak suddenly charged . Dalassenos lifted his arm to shield himself , but the Kurd launched his spear at him . The general wore no cuirass , and the blow killed him . 
 Dalassenos ' death changed the tide of the battle : the Fatimids took heart and , shouting " the enemy of God is dead ! " , turned on the Byzantines , who fell into panic and fled . The garrison of Apamea too sallied forth , completing the Byzantine debacle . The sources give various numbers for the Byzantine dead : Maqrizi mentions 5 @,@ 000 , Yahya of Antioch 6 @,@ 000 , and Ibn al @-@ Qalanisi as many as 10 @,@ 000 dead . Most of the remaining Byzantines ( 2 @,@ 000 according to Ibn al @-@ Qalanisi ) were taken prisoner by the Fatimids . These included several senior officers , including the famed Georgian patrikios <unk> , a nephew of <unk> <unk> , as well as the two sons of Dalassenos , Constantine and Theophylact , who were bought by Jaysh ibn Samsama for 6 @,@ 000 dinars and spent the next ten years as captives in Cairo . Stephen of Taron gives a slightly different account of the battle , whereby the victorious Byzantines were surprised by an attack by the regrouped Fatimids on their camp and that one of Dalassenos 's brothers and one of his sons were killed , as well as the general himself . This version is commonly rejected by modern scholars . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Dalassenos ' defeat forced Basil II to personally lead yet another campaign in Syria the following year . Arriving in Syria in mid @-@ September , the emperor 's army buried their fallen in the field of Apamea and then captured Shayzar , sacked Hisn <unk> and Rafaniya , torched Arqa , and raided the environs of Baalbek , Beirut , Tripoli and Jubayl . In mid @-@ December , Basil returned to Antioch , where he installed Nikephoros Ouranos as doux , although according to his self @-@ description as the " ruler of the East " , his role seems to have been more extensive , with plenipotentiary military and civilian authority over the entire eastern frontier . In 1001 , Basil II concluded a ten @-@ year truce with the Fatimid Caliph al @-@ Hakim . 
 = LS3 / 5A = 
 The LS3 / 5A ( each element pronounced separately , without the stroke ) is a small studio monitor loudspeaker originated by the BBC for use by outside broadcast vans to ensure quality of their broadcasts . The speaker concept set out transparent and natural sound as the goal , and the achievement of the end result is widely acknowledged . 
 The BBC granted licences to a small number of British firms , who first manufactured the product in 1975 . The product underwent a change in 1987 due to consistency issues in manufacturing , and again in around 2003 when original parts from KEF ran out . Upwards of 60 @,@ 000 pairs of the speaker have been sold . Reviewers have recognised its enormous importance as a bookshelf design . 
 = = History = = 
 The LS3 / 5A is a commercially produced loudspeaker driven by the need of the BBC to monitor and assess broadcast programme quality . It was derived from the LS3 / 5 , which was conceived and developed by the BBC Engineering Department in the early 1970s , when it was under the stewardship of Dudley Harwood . Having found no commercially produced small loudspeaker that met the requirement for naturalness and sonic neutrality , the BBC specifically set out to design a speaker to achieve natural overall sound quality and good dynamic range for monitoring broadcasts in tightly confined spaces . 
 As the BBC broadcasting unit was about to order another batch of the monitor , it was found that the supplier had modified the drive units , meaning the LS3 / 5 design had to be fundamentally revised . The BBC 's Designs Department was called upon to adapt the product in light of the supply changes . Modifications were made to adapt to the new drive units and deal with the altered resonance pattern , and the LS3 / 5 became the LS3 / 5A . 
 The BBC then licensed the product to a small number of private sector companies . Production began in 1975 . In 1987 , as a result of reassessment of the product due to consistency issues in the manufacture of the mid – bass driver , the drivers were modified and the crossover changed . The overall impedance of the crossover fell to 11 ohms from the original 15 ohms . 
 The various official versions of the LS3 / 5A from various licensees sold in significant numbers in its life of over a quarter of a century . Sales estimates range from 60 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 pairs . 
 In the tail end of the 1990s , due to the parts being discontinued , the 3 / 5 had technically reached the end of the road . Some licensees continued to make small numbers of speakers , for a while , using re @-@ manufactured parts . However , Stirling Broadcast , one of the last batch of licensees , completely redesigned the product based on the audio signature of the original , and launched the LS3 / 5A v2 with the full endorsement of the broadcaster in early 2006 . 
 In 2014 , production of the 15 ohm version of the LS3 / 5a with a full BBC Licence was re @-@ commenced by Falcon Acoustics [ 25 ] using re @-@ engineered versions of the original drive units and the original design BBC crossover [ 4 ] all produced in @-@ house .

 The product name is derived from BBC naming convention : the " LS3 " designation meant it was a loudspeaker intended for outside broadcasting , as opposed to the " <unk> " loudspeaker , intended for studio monitoring . The number after the stroke is the model number , the LS3 / 5 is " number 5 " outside @-@ broadcasting loudspeaker . The letter that follows denotes alterations to the original specification , of which there was only one in this instance after the LS3 / 5 , thus the " A " . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 For its outside broadcasting monitoring , the BBC required a small studio monitor suitable for near @-@ field monitoring of the frequency range from 400 Hz to about 20 kHz . The principal constraints were space and situations where using headphones is unsatisfactory , such as in mobile broadcasting vans . There were no commercial constraints . The BBC Research Department , then situated at Kingswood Warren , were responsible for development work , and commenced scaling tests in 1968 . They were able to answer a request for a prototype in under a week because it resembled an experimental loudspeaker that the department had already developed for some preliminary acoustic scaling tests . The speaker had to be voiced by ear an octave at a time , because scale test results were inapplicable to a model of this size . Engineers took measurements ; comparisons were performed against the <unk> / 8 – a large " Grade I monitor " already in use at the time – and with live sources . In 1970 engineers came up with the LS3 / 5 , built using the KEF B110 ( <unk> ) and the KEF T27 ( <unk> ) drive units , and a 9 @-@ ohm crossover filter . Estimated development costs of the order of £ 100 @,@ 000 were said to have been incurred at the time . Approximately 20 units of the LS3 / 5 were produced in @-@ house . 
 The BBC had initiated tendering to have the LS3 / 5 made under license . As the broadcasting unit was about to order another batch of the monitor , it was found that KEF had discontinued the B110 ( <unk> ) and the T27 ( <unk> ) in favour of the B110 ( SP1003 ) and T27 ( SP1032 ) specification , and was already using them in the Coda , one of their own @-@ brand commercial loudspeakers . Thus the design had to be revised because these new units had different impedances , technical characteristics and altered resonance patterns . [ 2 ] [ 4 ] The tweeter was considered potentially fragile because it now had an exposed dome , so a suitable protection grille was found to cover and protect the dome . The tweeter was also surrounded by a thick felt rectangle to prevent interference pattern effects being created by the edge of the cabinet . The crossover also had to undergo change , and the LS3 / 5 became the LS3 / 5A in the early summer of 1974 . 
 The KEF B110 SP1003 is a <unk> speaker with a doped <unk> ( a proprietary type of polystyrene <unk> ) cone and a neoprene surround . The KEF T27 SP1032 has a 19mm mylar dome fitted and is with a perforated protection grille . The loudspeaker has an internal volume of approximately 5 litres . The speaker cabinet ( loudspeaker enclosure ) measuring 31 by 19 by 16 centimetres ( 12 @.@ 2 in × 7 @.@ 5 in × 6 @.@ 3 in ) , is made using 12 mm ( 0 @.@ 47 in ) birch plywood strengthened at every joint with beech braces , and heavily damped . Although there was no specification for the wood of the original LS3 / 5 cabinets , the BBC closely specified wood types in defining the LS3 / 5A due to concerns that other hard woods – specifically Parana pine , with which the BBC conducted tests – would cause noticeable colouration ( i.e. detract from sonic neutrality ) due to interaction with a resonance of the bass drivers . 
 Martin Colloms notes in Hi @-@ Fi Critic that : " Hardly any component in either enclosure or driver may be substituted without the blend suffering audible disturbance . This is because the 3 / 5A sets such a high standard for tonal balance that errors which would pass unnoticed in an ordinary speaker are readily exposed " . The BBC then licensed the product to a small number of private sector companies . 
 In a review in Stereophile , John Atkinson remarked on how it was " virtually unknown for a speaker to be still available , virtually unchanged , 14 years after [ its introduction ] " . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 J. Gordon Holt indicates in Stereophile that most of the cost lay inside the case , having been spent on a complex equaliser and phase @-@ corrected crossover . However , Holt 's colleague , John Atkinson , notes that the cabinet alone " costs the manufacturer the same as the retail price of a typical <unk> [ sic ] speaker " . Only specific speaker drivers manufactured to strict tolerances may be used . There were other measures to control diffraction and ensure tonal neutrality . 
 The circuitry provides equalisation in both high and low frequency sections . The 13 @-@ element crossover includes an inductor for the treble section with seven positions that allows adjustment to match level of mid to treble sensitivities . The design also specifies high quality screened air @-@ gap inductors and film capacitors . David <unk> in Hi @-@ Fi Answers suggests it was a costlier speaker to build than imagined because tight specifications meant a high failure rate in production – the BBC had specified " the finest , most expensive ingredients and representing an investment of hours of skilled labour " . 
 = = = Signature sound = = = 
 Typical of sealed @-@ box speakers of similar size , the 3 / 5A has little or no low bass , but the design reinforced its lower register by a boost at around 160 Hz , giving the subjective impression that the speaker is more bass @-@ rich . It has a gently rising frequency response above <unk> , leading reviewers to notice the sound being a little bright at the treble registers , or that the speakers " reproduce the high @-@ end roughness of solid @-@ state amplifiers mercilessly " thus suggested partnering with valve amplification would be advantageous . A slight nasal quality in the midrange has also been noted in the earlier versions . The accuracy and stability of its stereo imaging and its clean midrange reproduction are also appreciated qualities . J. Gordon Holt suggests that the quality was " comparable to that from Quad <unk> , at far lower cost and with added bonuses of slightly smoother high end , better stereo imaging , a broader listening area " . John Atkinson suggests in Stereophile that the LS3 / 5A is ideally suited to the reproduction of program having a limited dynamic @-@ range requirement , for example chamber music ; he said that the LS3 / 5A " has never <unk> and never will ; it 's just too polite ever to cut the mustard on rock , or even <unk> jazz " .

 A total of 11 companies were ever granted licenses by the BBC to manufacture the model , a maximum of 3 at any given time . The product proved highly challenging to manufacture , if for no other reason than tight specifications and consistency of parts , and many of these companies would have a chequered corporate history . Audible differences could result from the mounting screws , grille fabric , or the origin of the wool . 
 Rogers Audio was the earliest licensee , but went out of business before producing a single unit . The Rogers name was bought by <unk> , who started manufacturing the 3 / 5A under licence in 1975 . Rogers ' production accounted for the majority , of around 43 @,@ 000 pairs by 1988 , and 50 @,@ 000 pairs in total . Of the other main manufacturers , <unk> produced about 22 @,@ 000 pairs , and <unk> 10 @,@ 000 . Dudley Harwood , the BBC engineer instrumental in the creation of the 3 / 5A , started <unk> and obtained a license in 1977 , but the company produced no LS3 / 5As for a decade . Eventually , <unk> accounted for 7 @,@ 000 pairs . KEF , who obtained its licence in 1993 , claims approximately 4 @,@ 000 pairs made . Other licensees included Chartwell , RAM , Goodmans and Stirling <unk> current licence for the 15 ohm LS3 / 5a is held by Falcon Acoustics

 Despite not being a " commercial product " at the outset , the LS3 / 5A was commercially successful in its twenty @-@ something @-@ year life , from 1975 until approximately 2000 , when the availability of KEF drive units came to an end . The speaker has amassed an " enthusiastic , focused , and loyal [ ... ] following , and none so large or vocal " , according to Paul Seydor in The Absolute Sound . 
 Estimates of their sales differ , possibly due to scope and cut @-@ off : when it ceased production in 1998 , " some 100 @,@ 000 pairs were in circulation , with 3000 pairs sold in its last year alone " , according to Seydor ; in 2001 , Ken Kessler similarly estimated in Hi @-@ fi News that 100 @,@ 000 pairs had been produced . In 2007 , Martin Colloms reported " more than 60 @,@ 000 pairs of the original LS3 / 5As were made " . John Atkinson noted that it had sold in excess of 60 @,@ 000 up to 1988 , of which Rogers represented two @-@ thirds . 
 Atkinson notes in 2007 that the sound of the speaker had not dated whilst many other speakers of the 1960s and 70s had . He guessed that LS3 / 5A remained competitive due to the exhaustive considerations and top engineering talent that went into its design ; maybe some luck was involved . Art Dudley commented in Stereophile on the LS3 / 5A 's " towering significance " as a bookshelf design .

 It had become apparent in around 1987 that a number of units already in the field were not up to specification . In particular , it was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain KEF drivers of acceptable tolerances , particular the woofer . Measurements of the 1 – 1 @.@ 5 kHz peak of some units produced at the time were up to <unk> higher . KEF underwent a program to improve consistency of both drive @-@ unit and the associated crossover , taking care not to alter frequency characteristics or tonal balances . KEF specially redesigned the B110 , creating the B110 <unk> where the surround changed from neoprene to a vinyl compound . KEF also designed a new crossover , designated <unk> . The crossover , also redesigned to accommodate the changes , saw its overall impedance fall to 11 ohms from the original 15 ohms . KEF also manufactured and supplied the crossover with the drive units in kits where the pairs have been electrically matched by computer to ensure balanced performance . Martin Colloms had implied in Hi @-@ fi News in August 1988 that the BBC had taken a pragmatic decision to a revise the design , to ensure that targeted production levels could be maintained . 
 In 1990 , the BBC authorised licensees to manufacture models capable of being bi @-@ wired , but stipulated that the performance in single @-@ wired mode must meet the original specification . KEF started making the bi @-@ wire crossover , designated <unk> , available in 1991 . 
 = = = 2005 – birth of LS3 / 5A " V2 " = = = 
 Upon obtaining a BBC licence to produce legacy 11 @-@ ohm LS3 / 5A , Stirling Broadcast commissioned KEF to produce new T27 and B110 drive units . Stirling had to rethink the product when KEF finally ceased manufacturing the drive units in about 2000 . Working with drivers from SEAS and <unk> , Derek Hughes developed for Stirling a new crossover that enabled the new proprietary drivers to mimic the response of the original KEF drivers they replaced . Specifically , the T27 was replaced by a 19mm doped fabric dome tweeter . The mid – bass unit is a formed polypropylene co @-@ polymer cone to which a damping coating has been applied and given a synthetic rubber roll surround . The crossover has three settings of relative high frequency level , in steps of <unk> Each crossover is tuned to the specific pairs of drive units . While Stirling 's revision deviates technically from the specification , the company took steps to research and test to ensure the LS3 / 5A sound was preserved , " warts and all " . Stirling added a " V2 " to the designation when the product was launched in 2005 in an act of transparency , even though the broadcaster has endorsed it .

 Falcon Acoustics was granted a licence by the BBC for the 15 ohm version of the LS3 / 5a in 2013 and commenced production in 2014 using drive units produced in @-@ house by Falcon Acoustics . The Falcon F B110 bass unit is a re @-@ engineered version using the same components of the original KEF B110 SP1003 with a doped <unk> cone and a neoprene surround . The Falcon F T27 tweeter again uses the same components as the original KEF T27 SP1032 and has a 19mm mylar dome fitted . Both Falcon units were designed by Malcolm Jones who while employed at KEF between 1962 and 1974 was responsible for the design of the KEF B110 and T27 units originally used in the LS3 / 5 and LS3 / 5a . Both units are graded / selected to meet the BBC specification . <unk> are close tolerance pair matched versions of the original BBC LS3 / 5a crossover design [ 4 ] using tapped transformers for high frequency adjustments .

KEF released its CS1 constructor kit ( 1981 ) to tap the home @-@ build market .

Martin Colloms said it possessed an almost perfectly flat frequency response , but that " it neither sounded as lifelike , nor did it really better the musical performance of the standard 3 / 5a " . 
 = Bournemouth = 
 Bournemouth / <unk> / is a large coastal resort town on the south coast of England directly to the east of the Jurassic Coast , a 96 @-@ mile ( 155 km ) World Heritage Site . According to the 2011 census , the town has a population of 183 @,@ 491 making it the largest settlement in Dorset . With Poole to the west and Christchurch in the east , Bournemouth forms the South East Dorset conurbation , which has a total population of over 465 @,@ 000 . 
 Before it was founded in 1810 by Lewis Tregonwell , the area was a deserted heathland occasionally visited by fishermen and smugglers . Initially marketed as a health resort , the town received a boost when it appeared in Dr Granville 's book , The Spas of England . Bournemouth 's growth really accelerated with the arrival of the railway and it became a recognised town in 1870 . Historically part of Hampshire , it joined Dorset with the reorganisation of local government in 1974 . Since 1997 , the town has been administered by a unitary authority , giving it autonomy from Dorset County Council although it remains part of the ceremonial county . The local council is Bournemouth Borough Council . 
 The town centre has notable Victorian architecture and the 202 @-@ foot ( 62 m ) spire of St Peter 's Church , one of three Grade I listed churches in the borough , is a local landmark . Bournemouth 's location has made it a popular destination for tourists , attracting over five million visitors annually with its beaches and popular nightlife . The town is also a regional centre of business , home of the Bournemouth International Centre or BIC , and a financial sector that is worth more than £ 1 @,@ 000 million in Gross Value Added . 
 = = Toponymy = = 
 The first mention of Bournemouth comes in the Christchurch cartulary of 1406 , where a monk describes how a large fish ( " uni <unk> piscis " ) , 18 ft. long , was washed up at " La <unk> " in October of that year and taken to the Manor of Wick ; six days later , a portion of the fish was collected by a canon from Christchurch Priory and taken away as tithe . " La <unk> " , however , was purely a geographic reference to the uninhabited area around the mouth of the small river which , in turn , drained the heathland between the towns of Poole and Christchurch . The word bourne , meaning a small stream , is a derivative of <unk> , old English for a brook . From the latter half of the 16th century " Bourne Mouth " seems to be preferred , being recorded as such in surveys and reports of the period , but this appears to have been shortened to " Bourne " after the area had started to develop . A travel guide published in 1831 calls the place " Bourne Cliffe " or " Tregonwell 's Bourne " after its founder . The Spas of England , published ten years later , calls it simply " Bourne " as does an 1838 edition of the Hampshire Advertiser . In the late 19th century " Bournemouth " became predominant , although its two @-@ word form appears to have remained in use up until at least the early 20th century , turning up on a 1909 ordnance map . 
 = = History = = 
 In the 12th century the region around the mouth of the River Bourne was part of the Hundred of <unk> . The hundred later became the Liberty of Westover when it was also extended to include the settlements of North Ashley , <unk> , <unk> , Throop , Iford , Pokesdown , Tuckton and Wick , and incorporated into the Manor of Christchurch . Although the Dorset and Hampshire region surrounding it had been the site of human settlement for thousands of years , Westover was largely a remote and barren heathland before 1800 . In 1574 the Earl of Southampton noted that the area was " Devoid of all habitation " , and as late as 1795 the Duke of Rutland recorded that " ... on this barren and uncultivated heath there was not a human to direct us " . 
 In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the Borough of Bournemouth would grow to encompass a number of ancient settlements along the River Stour , including <unk> where a skull thought to be 5 @,@ 500 years old was found in 1932 . Bronze Age burials near <unk> , and the discovery of Iron Age pottery on the East Cliff in 1969 , suggest there may have been settlements there during that period . Hengistbury Head , added to the borough in 1932 , was the site of a much older Palaeolithic encampment . During the latter half of the 16th century James Blount , 6th Baron Mountjoy , began mining for alum in the area , and at one time part of the heath was used for hunting , although by the late 18th century little evidence of either event remained . No @-@ one lived at the mouth of the Bourne river and the only regular visitors to the area before the 19th century were a few fishermen , turf cutters and gangs of smugglers . 
 Prior to the Christchurch <unk> Act 1802 , more than 70 % of the Westover area was common land . The act , together with the Inclosure Commissioners ' Award of 1805 , transferred five thousand acres into the hands of five private owners , including James Harris , 1st Earl of Malmesbury , and Sir George Ivison Tapps . In 1809 the Tapps Arms public house appeared on the heath . A few years later , in 1812 , the first official residents , retired army officer Lewis Tregonwell and his wife , moved into their new home built on land purchased from Tapps . The area was well known to Tregonwell who , during the Napoleonic wars , spent much of his time searching the heath and coastline for French invaders and smugglers . 
 Anticipating that people would come to the area to indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of sea @-@ bathing , an activity with perceived health benefits , Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822 , which he hoped to let out . The common belief that pine @-@ scented air was good for lung conditions , and in particular tuberculosis , prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of pine trees . These early attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant that by the time Tregonwell had died in 1832 , Bournemouth had grown into a small community with a scattering of houses , villas and cottages . The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree @-@ lined walk to the beach , later to become known as the Invalids ' Walk . 
 After the death of Tapps in 1835 , his son Sir George William Tapps @-@ Gervis inherited his father 's estate . He hired the young local architect Benjamin Ferrey to develop the coastal area on the east side of the stream . Bournemouth 's first hotel , later to become part of the Royal Bath Hotel , opened in 1838 and is one of the few buildings designed by Ferrey still standing . Bournemouth started to grow at a faster rate as Tapps @-@ Gervis began developing the area similarly to the south coast resorts of Weymouth and Brighton . Despite enormous investment , the town 's share of the market remained modest . In 1841 Tapps @-@ Gervis invited the physician and writer Augustus Granville to stay . Granville was the author of The Spas of England , which described health resorts around the country , and as a result of his visit he included a chapter on Bournemouth in the second edition of his book . The publication of the book , and the increase in visitors seeking the medicinal use of seawater and the pine @-@ scented air , helped the town to grow and establish itself as an early tourist destination . 
 In the 1840s Benjamin Ferrey was replaced by Decimus Burton , whose plans for Bournemouth included the construction of a garden alongside the Bourne stream , an idea first mooted by Granville . The fields south of the road crossing ( later Bournemouth Square ) were drained and laid out with shrubberies and walks . Many of these paths , including the Invalids ' Walk , remain in the town today . A second suggestion of Granville 's , a sanatorium , was completed in 1855 and greatly raised Bournemouth 's profile as a place for recuperation . 
 At a time when the most convenient way to arrive in the town was by sea , a pier was considered to be a necessity . <unk> Parish Council were reluctant to find the money , and an attempt to raise the money privately in 1847 had only succeeded in financing a small 100 feet ( 30 m ) jetty . The Bournemouth Improvement Act of 1856 granted greater financial autonomy to the town and a pier was approved that year . A number of wooden structures were built before an 838 feet ( 255 m ) cast iron design by Eugenius Birch was completed in 1880 . Under the Act , a board of 13 Commissioners was established to build and organise the expanding infrastructure of the town , such as paving , sewers , drainage , street lighting and street cleaning . 
 The arrival of the railways in 1870 precipitated a massive growth in seaside and summer visitors to the town , especially from the Midlands and London . In 1880 the town had a population of 17 @,@ 000 , but by 1900 , when railway connections to Bournemouth were at their most developed , the town 's population had risen to 60 @,@ 000 and it had become a favourite location for visiting artists and writers . The town was improved greatly during this period through the efforts of Sir Merton Russell @-@ Cotes , the town 's mayor and a local philanthropist , who helped to establish the town 's first library and museum . The Russell @-@ Cotes Art Gallery & Museum was housed in his mansion , and after his death it was given to the town . Bournemouth became a municipal borough in 1890 and a county borough in 1900 . 
 As Bournemouth 's growth increased in the early 20th century , the town centre spawned theatres , cafés , two art deco cinemas and more hotels . Other new buildings included the war memorial in 1921 and the Bournemouth Pavilion , the town 's concert hall and grand theatre , finished in 1925 . 
 The town escaped heavy bombing during the Second World War , but the sea front incurred great damage when it was fortified against invasion . The cast iron lampposts and benches along the front were removed and melted down for munitions , as was much of the superstructure from both Bournemouth and Boscombe piers before they were breached to prevent their use by enemy ships . The large amounts of barbed wire and anti @-@ tank obstacles along the beach , and the mines at the foot of the chines , took two years to remove when peace was finally achieved . 
 The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed an inshore lifeboat at Bournemouth between 1965 and 1972 . Coverage for the area has otherwise been provided from Poole Lifeboat Station . The Bournemouth International Centre ( BIC ) , a large conference and exhibition centre , was constructed near the seafront in 1984 , and in the following year Bournemouth became the first town in the United Kingdom to introduce and use CCTV cameras for public street @-@ based surveillance . 
 The Waterfront complex , which was intended to hold an IMAX cinema , was constructed on the seafront in 1998 . The 19 m ( 62 ft ) -high concrete and smoked glass building featured a wavy roof design , but was despised by residents and visitors alike because it blocked views of the bay and the Isle of Purbeck . In 2005 it was voted the most hated building in England in a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ person poll conducted by the Channel 4 programme Demolition , and was pulled down in spring 2013 . The site is to be used as an outdoor event arena . The council still plan a larger redevelopment of the site and adjoining council land in the long term . 
 In 2012 Bournemouth was unsuccessful in its bid for city status , losing out to Chelmsford in competition with 26 other towns to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II 's Diamond Jubilee . 
 = = Governance = = 
 Historically Bournemouth was part of Hampshire , with neighbouring Poole , just to the west of the border , in Dorset . At the time of the 1974 local government re @-@ organisation , it was considered desirable that the whole of the Poole / Bournemouth urban area should be part of the same county . Bournemouth therefore became part of the non @-@ metropolitan county of Dorset on 1 April 1974 . On 1 April 1997 , Bournemouth became a unitary authority , independent from Dorset County Council . For the purposes of the Lieutenancy it remains part of the ceremonial county of Dorset . 
 For local elections the district is divided into 18 wards , and the Bournemouth Borough Council is elected every four years . In the 2011 local elections the Conservatives held overall control , winning 45 of the available 51 seats . The Council elects a Mayor and Deputy Mayor annually . For 2014 – 15 the mayor is Chris Mayne . 
 Bournemouth is represented by two parliamentary constituencies in the House of Commons ; Bournemouth East and Bournemouth West . In the 2010 general election , the former was held for the Conservatives by Tobias Elwood with 48 @.@ 4 % of the vote , while the latter was also held for the Conservatives by Connor Burns with 45 @.@ 1 % . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Bournemouth is about 94 miles ( 151 km ) southwest of London at 50 ° 43 ′ 12 ″ N 1 ° 52 ′ 48 ″ W. The borough borders the neighbouring boroughs of Poole and Christchurch to the west and east respectively and the East Dorset District to the north . Poole Bay lies to the South . The River Stour forms a natural boundary to the north and east , terminating at Christchurch Harbour ; while the River Bourne rises in Poole and flows through the middle of Bournemouth town centre , into the English Channel . The towns of Poole , Bournemouth and Christchurch form the South East Dorset conurbation with a combined population of over 400 @,@ 000 . Bournemouth is both a retail and commercial centre . Areas within Bournemouth include : Boscombe , <unk> , Southbourne , <unk> , Throop , Westbourne and Winton . 
 The area 's geology has little variety , comprising almost entirely of Eocene clays which , prior to urbanisation , supported a heathland environment . Patches of the original heath still remain , notably <unk> Common , a 36 @-@ hectare ( 89 @-@ acre ) site , much of which is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest . This heathland habitat is home to all six species of native reptile , the Dartford warbler and some important flora such as sundew and bog asphodel . Small populations of Exmoor pony and Shetland cattle help to maintain the area . Bournemouth is directly north of Old Harry Rocks , the easternmost end of the Jurassic Coast , 96 miles ( 155 km ) of coastline designated a World Heritage Site in 2001 . Bournemouth 's own coastline stretches from Sandbanks to Christchurch Harbour and comprises mainly sandy beaches backed by gravel and sandy clay cliffs . These cliffs are cut by a number of chines which provide natural access to the shore . At the easternmost point lies Hengistbury Head , a narrow peninsula that forms the southern shore of Christchurch Harbour . It is a local nature reserve and the site of a Bronze Age settlement . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Like all of the UK , Bournemouth has a temperate oceanic climate with moderate variation in annual and daily temperatures , cool summers , and frequent overcast skies . From 1981 to 2010 the annual mean temperature was 10 to 11 ° C ( 50 to 52 ° F ) . The warmest months are July and August , which have an average temperature range of 12 to 22 ° C ( 54 to 72 ° F ) , while the coolest months are January and February , which have an average temperature range of 1 to 8 ° C ( 34 to 46 ° F ) . Average rainfall in Bournemouth is around 800 mm ( 31 in ) annually , well below the national average of 1 @,@ 126 millimetres . Since 1960 , temperature extremes as measured at Bournemouth Hurn Airport have ranged from 34 @.@ 1 ° C ( 93 @.@ 4 ° F ) in August 1990 , down to − 13 @.@ 4 ° C ( 7 @.@ 9 ° F ) in January 1963 .

 Historically Bournemouth has suffered from negative rates of natural increase and has relied on immigration to maintain population growth . In 2007 however , births exceeded deaths for the first time , and this trend has continued through to 2011 . This , coupled with a substantial increase in people moving into the area , has led to a sharp rise in the resident population since 2001 . Of the total population , 3 @.@ 3 % are 85 or over , compared to 2 @.@ 2 % nationally ; however the largest group of people moving into the area are students in the 16 @-@ 24 @-@ year age group , and 9 % of the current population are between 20 and 24 . In England this age group accounts for only 7 % . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Similarly to the rest of Dorset , Bournemouth 's economy is primarily in the service sector , which employed 95 % of the workforce in 2010 . This was 10 % higher than the average employment in the service sector for Great Britain and 11 % higher than the South West . Of particular importance are the financial and public service sectors which through 2011 continued to show sustained growth . Compared to the rest of the country , Bournemouth performed well in these two areas but under performed in transport and communications . 
 The smallest geographical region for which Gross Value Added information is available is the <unk> area , Bournemouth and Poole . The latest figures , as of 2012 , are for the year 2009 which showed that the Bournemouth and Poole area enjoyed the strongest annualised growth in the South @-@ West region . In 2009 the South West Regional Accounts showed that the Financial Services sector in Bournemouth was worth £ 1 @,@ 031 @.@ 8 million in Gross Value Added . Important employers in this sector include : JPMorgan , Nationwide Building Society , and the Liverpool Victoria , Tata Consultancy Services ( formerly Unisys ) , and RIAS insurance companies . The manufacturing sector is predominantly based in neighbouring Poole , but still employed 2 % of the workforce in 2010 and 2 @.@ 6 % in 2011 . 
 Tourism is also important to the local economy . In 2011 , domestic and overseas visitors made more than 5 @.@ 6 million trips to the town and spent over £ 460 million between them . The equivalent of 8 @,@ 531 full @-@ time jobs exist as a result which accounts for 15 % of all employment in the town . Bournemouth seafront is one of the UK 's biggest attractions with 4 @.@ 5 million visitors in 2011 . RNLI lifeguards provide seasonal coverage of Bournemouth 's beaches . 
 With a third of all town centre businesses in the leisure industry , Bournemouth has a booming nightlife economy and is a popular destination for stag and hen parties . These party @-@ goers contribute £ 125 million a year to the economy and support 4 @,@ 000 jobs . In 2010 the town was awarded a Purple Flag for providing a wide variety of night @-@ time activities while maintaining the safety of both residents and visitors . An independent report published in 2012 indicates there has been a rise in antisocial behaviour which it attributes to the increase in nightlife . 
 Those of working age make up approximately 65 % of Bournemouth 's population and of these , 74 @.@ 6 % are economically active although not necessarily employed within the Bournemouth area . Industry in Bournemouth employed more than 76 @,@ 400 people in 2011 but not all of these were Bournemouth residents . Of those employed in Bournemouth based industries , 29 @.@ 32 % were employed in the public administration , education and health sector . This compares favourably with Dorset , the South @-@ West region , and the country as a whole , as do the other large sectors ; distribution , hotels & restaurants ( 29 @.@ 06 % ) , and banking , finance and insurance ( 24 @.@ 48 % ) . 37 @.@ 2 % of Bournemouth 's resident population are employed full @-@ time while 13 @.@ 3 % are employed part @-@ time .

 The shopping streets are mostly pedestrianised with modern shopping malls , Victorian arcades and a large selection of bars , clubs and cafés . North of the centre there is an out @-@ of @-@ town shopping complex called <unk> . The 41 acre site has 40 units and was the largest shopping centre in the UK when it opened it 2003 . Other major shopping areas are situated in the districts of Westbourne and Boscombe . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Bournemouth is a tourist and regional centre for leisure , entertainment , culture and recreation . Local author and former mayor , Keith Rawlings , suggests that Bournemouth has a thriving youth culture due to its large university population and many language school students . In recent years , Bournemouth has become a popular nightlife destination with UK visitors and many clubs , bars and restaurants are located within the town centre . In a 2007 survey by First Direct , Bournemouth was found to be the happiest place in the UK , with 82 % of people questioned saying they were happy with their lives . 
 Major venues for concerts include BIC , Pavilion Theatre and O2 Academy . Built in 1984 , the BIC is also a popular place for party political conferences and has been used by all three major political parties . Its four auditoria make it the largest venue on the south coast . The O2 and Pavilion are older and are both Grade II listed buildings . The O2 , which opened in 1895 as the Grand Pavilion Theatre , was initially used as a circus and later for music hall theatre . The Pavilion opened in 1929 as concert hall and tea room while also providing a venue for the municipal orchestra . It continues to provide traditional entertainment today , presenting West End stage shows , ballet and operas . Bournemouth has more than 200 listed buildings , mainly from the Victorian and Edwardian eras , including three grade I churches ; St Peter 's , St Clement 's and St Stephen 's . 
 The Russell @-@ Cotes Museum is a Grade II * listed , villa completed in 1901 . It houses artefacts and paintings collected by the Victorian philanthropist Merton Russell @-@ Cotes and his wife during their extensive travels around the world . The four art galleries display paintings by William Powell Frith , Edwin Landseer , Edwin Long , William Orchardson , Arthur Hughes , Albert Moore and Dante Gabriel Rossetti . It was Russell @-@ Cotes who successfully campaigned to have a promenade built ; it runs continuously along the Bournemouth and Poole shoreline . 
 The Lower , Central and Upper Gardens are Grade II * public parks , leading for several miles down the valley of the River Bourne through the centre of the town to the sea . Bournemouth has a further 425 acres ( 172 ha ) of parkland . Initially serving to compensate for the loss of common rights after common land was enclosed in 1802 , it was held in trust until 1889 when ownership passed to Bournemouth Corporation and the land became five public parks : King 's Park , Queen 's Park , Meyrick Park , Seafield Gardens and Redhill Common . 
 The detailed Land Use Survey by the Office for National Statistics in 2005 noted that the local authority area of Bournemouth had the third highest proportion of land taken up by domestic gardens , 34 @.@ 6 % , of the 326 districts in England ; narrowly less than the London Boroughs of Harrow and Sutton at the time with 34 @.@ 7 % and 35 @.@ 1 % . 
 One of Bournemouth 's most noted cultural institutions is Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra which was formed in 1893 under Dan Godfrey . It became the first municipal orchestra in the country when in 1896 , Bournemouth Borough Council took control and Godfrey was appointed musical director and head of the town 's entertainments . Originally playing three concerts a day during the summer season , in the great glass palm house known as the Winter Gardens ; the orchestra is now based in Poole and performs around 130 concerts a year across Southern England . 
 Bournemouth is currently host to a number of festivals . Bournemouth Food and Drink Festival is a ten @-@ day event which combines a market with live cookery demonstrations . The Arts by the Sea Festival is a mix of dance , film , theatre , literature , and music which was launched in 2012 by the local university , the Arts University Bournemouth , and is set to become an annual event . The Bourne Free carnival is held in the town each year during the summer . Initially a gay pride festival , it has become a celebration of diversity and inclusion . Since 2008 , Bournemouth has held its own air festival over four days in August . This has featured displays from the Red Arrows as well as appearances from the <unk> , Blades , Team <unk> Wing @-@ Walkers , Battle of Britain Memorial Flight including Lancaster , Hurricane , Spitfire and also the last flying Vulcan . The festival has also seen appearances from modern aircraft such as the Eurofighter Typhoon . The air festival attracts up to a million people over the four @-@ day event . 
 The town was especially rich in literary associations during the late 19th century and earlier years of the 20th century . P. C. Wren author of Beau Geste , Frederick E. Smith , writer of the 633 Squadron books , and Beatrice Webb , later Potter , all lived in the town . Paul Verlaine taught at Bournemouth a preparatory school and the writer J. R. R. Tolkien , spent 30 years taking holidays in Bournemouth , staying in the same room at the Hotel Miramar . He eventually retired to the area in the 1960s with his wife Edith , where they lived close to Branksome Chine . Tolkien died in September 1973 at his home in Bournemouth but was buried in Oxfordshire . The house was demolished in 2008 . 
 Percy Florence Shelley lived at Boscombe Manor ; a house he had built for his mother , Mary Shelley , the writer and author of the Gothic horror novel , Frankenstein . Mary died before the house was completed but she was buried in Bournemouth , in accordance with her wishes . The family plot in St Peter 's churchyard also contains her parents William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft , and the heart of her husband , Percy Bysshe Shelley . Robert Louis Stevenson wrote The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and most of his novel Kidnapped from his house " Skerryvore " on the west cliff , Westbourne . Vladimir <unk> established a <unk> publishing house with other Russian exiles at Tuckton , and under the ' Free Age Press ' imprint , published the first edition of several works by Leo Tolstoy . Author Bill Bryson worked for a time with the Bournemouth Echo newspaper and wrote about the town in his 1995 work Notes from a Small Island .

 Bournemouth has three Grade I listed churches , St Peter 's and St Stephen 's in the town centre and St Clement 's in Boscombe . St Peter 's was the town 's first church , completed in 1879 and designed by George Edmund Street . In his book , England 's Thousand Best Churches , Simon Jenkins describes the chancel as " one of the richest Gothic Revival interiors in England " , while the 202 feet ( 62 m ) spire dominates the surrounding skyline . When the architect , John Loughborough Pearson , designed St Stephen 's his aim was to , " bring people to their knees " . It has a high stone groined roof , twin aisles and a triforium gallery , although the tower lacks a spire . 
 The borough has two piers : Bournemouth Pier , close to the town centre , and the shorter but architecturally more important Boscombe Pier . Designed by the architect Archibald Smith , Boscombe Pier opened in 1889 as a 600 feet ( 180 m ) structure which was extended to 750 feet ( 230 m ) in 1927 when a new head was constructed . Added in 1958 , the boomerang @-@ shaped entrance kiosk and overhanging concrete roof is now a Grade II listed building . In 1961 a theatre was added but this was demolished in 2008 when the rest of the pier was renovated . In 2009 , fashion designer Wayne Hemingway described Boscombe Pier as " Britain 's coolest pier " . It was also voted Pier of the Year 2010 by the National Piers Society . 
 In 1856 , Bournemouth Pier was a simple , wooden jetty . This was replaced by a longer , wooden pier five years later , and a cast iron structure in 1880 . Two extensions to the pier in 1894 and 1905 , brought the total length to 305 metres ( 1000 feet ) . After World War II , the structure was strengthened to allow for the addition of a Pier Theatre , finally constructed in 1960 . Between 1979 and 1981 , a £ 1 @.@ 7 million redevelopment programme , saw a great deal of reconstruction work , and the addition of a large two @-@ storey , octagonal @-@ shaped entrance building . 
 Built as the Mont Dore Hotel in 1881 , Bournemouth Town Hall was designated a Grade II listed building in 2001 . Designed by Alfred <unk> in the French , Italian and neo @-@ classical styles , the foundation stone was laid by King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway and the hotel opened in 1885 . The buff brick exterior features Bath stone dressings and terracotta friezes . The main entrance is sited within a projected façade that reaches to the eaves and is topped with a pediment , while above sits a belvedere with turrets and a pavilion roof . During the First World War the hotel was used as a hospital for British and Indian soldiers and after as a convalescent home . It never opened as a hotel again and was purchased by Bournemouth Borough Council in 1919 . 
 Built in the Art Deco style in 1929 , situated close to the seafront , the Pavilion Theatre was at the time considered to be the greatest ever municipal enterprise for the benefit of entertainment . Built from brick and stone , the frontage features square Corinthian columns . Still a popular venue , it is today a Grade II listed building . 
 The Bournemouth Eye is a helium @-@ filled balloon attached to a steel cable in the town 's lower gardens . The spherical balloon is 69 m ( 226 ft ) in circumference and carries an enclosed , steel gondola . Rising to a height of 150 m ( 492 ft ) , it provides a panoramic view of the surrounding area for up to 28 passengers .

 The BIC has become a venue for a round of the Premier League Darts Championship organised by the Professional Darts Corporation . 
 The Westover and Bournemouth Rowing Club , is the town 's coastal rowing club . Established in 1865 , it is reported to be the oldest sporting association in the county . The club regularly competes in regattas organised by the Hants and Dorset Amateur Rowing Association which take place on the South Coast of England between May and September . 
 Other watersports popular in Poole Bay include sailing and surfing , and there are a number of local schools for the beginner to learn either sport . Bournemouth has the third largest community of surfers in the UK and in 2009 an artificial surf reef , one of only four in the world , was constructed there . The reef failed to deliver the promised grade 5 wave , suffered a series of delays and ran over budget , finally costing £ 3 @.@ 2 million .

 The principal route to the town centre is the A338 spur road , a dual carriageway that connects to the A31 close to the Hampshire border . The A31 joins the M27 at Southampton and from there the M3 to London and the A34 to the Midlands and the North can be accessed . The main road west is the A35 to Honiton in Devon which runs through the South East Dorset Conurbation and continues east as far as Southampton , albeit as a non @-@ primary route . The A350 in the neighbouring borough of Poole provides the only northern route out of the conurbation . National Express coaches serve Bournemouth Travel Interchange & Bournemouth University . There are frequent departures to London Victoria Coach Station and Heathrow Airport and Gatwick Airports . Local buses are provided mainly by two companies , More Bus , the former National Bus Company subsidiary and now owned by the Go @-@ Ahead group , and Yellow Buses , the former Bournemouth Council @-@ owned company and successors to Bournemouth Corporation Transport , which began operating trams in 1902 . Other operators serving the town include Damory Coaches and the Shaftesbury & District bus company .

 Originally an RAF airfield , Bournemouth Airport was transferred to the Civil Aviation Authority in 1944 and was the UK 's only intercontinental airport before the opening of Heathrow in 1946 . Acquired by the Manchester Airports Group in 2001 , the airport underwent a £ 45 million phased expansion programme between 2007 and 2011 . Situated in the village of Hurn on the periphery of Bournemouth , the airport is 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) from the town centre and serves around 600 @,@ 000 passengers annually . There are direct flights to 23 international destinations in nine countries : Cyprus , Finland , Greece ( 3 destinations ) , Italy ( 4 ) , Malta , Portugal , Spain ( 10 ) , Switzerland and Turkey . 
 = = Education = = 
 The Bournemouth local education authority was first set up in 1903 and remained in existence until local government was reorganised in 1974 when Bournemouth lost its County Borough status and became part of the county of Dorset . Under the later reforms of 1997 , Bournemouth became a unitary authority and the Bournemouth local education authority was re @-@ established . 
 The local council operates a two @-@ tier comprehensive system whereby pupils attend one of the 26 primary schools in the borough before completing their education at secondary school . Bournemouth is one of the minority of local authorities in England still to maintain selective education , with two grammar schools ( one for boys , one for girls ) and ten secondary modern / comprehensive schools . There are also a small number of independent schools in the town , and a further education college . Bournemouth has two universities : Bournemouth University and Arts University Bournemouth , both of which are located across the boundary in neighbouring Poole . 
 In 2012 , 60 @.@ 7 % of the borough 's school leavers gained 5 GCSEs of grade C or above . This was slightly better than the national average of 59 @.@ 4 % and above the average for the rest of Dorset , with 58 @.@ 8 % of pupils from the local authority of Poole , and 54 @.@ 1 % from the remainder of the county , managing to do likewise . 
 = = Religion = = 
 The 2011 census revealed that 57 @.@ 1 % of the borough 's population are Christian . With all other religions combined only totalling 4 @.@ 7 % , Christianity is by far the largest religious group . 40 % of the borough falls within the Church of England Diocese of Salisbury . The remainder , to the east , belongs to the Diocese of Winchester . The Roman Catholic Diocese of Portsmouth incorporates most of Bournemouth with the exception of two small parishes to the west which are covered by the Diocese of Plymouth . 
 The borough has several notable examples of Victorian church architecture including the previously mentioned St. Peter 's , the churchyard of which contains the grave of the author Mary Shelley ; St Stephen 's Church , completed in 1898 for services under the influence of the Oxford Movement and St Clement 's , one of the first churches to be designed by John Dando Sedding , built in Boscombe in 1871 . To serve a rapidly expanding population a third church was built in the town centre in 1891 . St Augustin 's church was commissioned by Henry <unk> who was ' priest @-@ in @-@ charge ' there until 1900 . The largest church in the town is the Richmond Hill St Andrew 's Church , part of the United Reformed Church . Built in 1865 and enlarged in 1891 , it has a seating capacity of 1 @,@ 100 and is unusually ornate for a non @-@ conformist church . 
 Few purpose @-@ built places of worship exist in borough for faiths other than Christianity although with a higher proportion of Jewish residents than the national average , there are three synagogues . Chabad @-@ Lubavitch of Bournemouth is a branch of the worldwide movement . The Bournemouth Reform Synagogue , formerly known as Bournemouth New Synagogue , is a Reform Jewish synagogue with over 700 members .

 = Hurricane Alma ( 1966 ) = 
 Hurricane Alma was a rare June major hurricane in the 1966 Atlantic hurricane season . It was the earliest Atlantic hurricane in the calendar year in fifteen years , as well as the earliest continental U.S. hurricane strike since 1825 . Alma developed on June 4 over Central America , and while moving through Honduras , it dropped heavy rainfall that killed at least 73 people in the city of San Rafael . Offshore northern Honduras , the system produced heavy rainfall in Swan Island . Alma moved northeastward and intensified into a hurricane on June 6 . It crossed western Cuba , causing heavy crop damage and water shortages . Alma destroyed over 1 @,@ 000 houses , and damage was estimated around $ 200 million ( 1966 USD ) . The storm killed 12 people in the country . 
 After crossing Cuba , Alma intensified further to reach winds of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) in the Gulf of Mexico . The hurricane passed west of Key West , Florida , causing a power outage and flooding . Alma dropped heavy rainfall and produced winds across most of Florida , which damaged crops and caused scattered power outages . The hurricane weakened before moving ashore near Apalachee Bay . Damage in Florida was estimated at $ 10 million , and there were six deaths in the state . Alma crossed southeastern Georgia as a tropical storm , damaging a few houses and causing light damage . The storm re @-@ intensified into a hurricane over the western Atlantic Ocean , and its outer rainbands dropped heavy rainfall in Wilmington , North Carolina . Alma encountered colder water temperatures and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on June 13 . Its remnants dissipated a day later over Massachusetts . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 During June 1966 , low atmospheric pressure stretched across the western Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico — a pattern that is conducive for tropical cyclogenesis . During the first few days of the month , a dissipating trough extended from the southeastern United States into the western Caribbean . A mid @-@ level circulation developed along the trough near Cabo Gracias a Dios on June 3 . By the next day , the circulation had reached the surface , which marked the development of a tropical depression over eastern Nicaragua . On June 5 , the depression crossed Honduras and emerged into the western Caribbean , moving north @-@ northeastward through an area of warm sea surface temperatures . It had a good cyclonic circulation , convection , and moisture content , but most significantly , a passing trough to the north provided the depression with favorable outflow . On June 6 , the depression rapidly intensified into Tropical Storm and later Hurricane Alma . This made it the earliest hurricane in the basin since Hurricane Able in 1951 . 
 After attaining hurricane status , Alma continued moving slowly to the north @-@ northeast , although its intensification rate slowed . While over the western Caribbean , Alma was a large hurricane with gale force winds covering about 200 @,@ 000 sq mi ( 520 @,@ 000 km2 ) . The hurricane accelerated on June 8 , quickly moving across Isla de la Juventud and later mainland Cuba with winds of around 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . Alma did not weaken over land and entered the Gulf of Mexico , where it turned northwestward and passed between Key West and the Dry Tortugas . Late on June 8 , a station in the Dry Tortugas reported winds of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) ; this would be Alma 's peak intensity . The hurricane began weakening as it paralleled the west coast of Florida , at which point a developing upper @-@ level low over the northern Gulf of Mexico began to influence its motion . While the hurricane moved northward through the Gulf of Mexico , it had a large , ragged eye that reached 75 mi ( 121 km ) in diameter . Initially , forecasters anticipated Alma would cross central Florida , although the hurricane turned to the north @-@ northwest . Cool water temperatures contributed to weakening , and Alma made landfall near Apalachee Bay with winds of 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) on June 9 . This marked the earliest United States hurricane landfall since a hurricane in May and June of 1825 . 
 While turning northeastward over northern Florida , Alma quickly weakened to a tropical storm . It moved across Georgia and emerged into the Atlantic near Savannah late on June 10 . Its circulation remained near the coast , although by late on June 11 , Alma had moved far enough offshore that it was able to re @-@ intensify into a hurricane . It developed a large eye and maintained hurricane intensity for about 18 hours . Afterward , Alma turned to the north into an area of drier air and colder waters , and again weakened to a tropical storm on June 12 . The next day , Alma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to the east of Maryland . The remnants continued to the northeast and dissipated on June 14 over Massachusetts . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 In Cuba , evacuations were ordered for Nueva Gerona on Isla de la Juventud , and for 113 @,@ 754 people on the mainland . Cattle were moved to a safe location for the storm 's passage . President Fidel Castro declared a state of emergency in four western provinces due to the threat to the local sugar industry . 
 Before Alma struck Florida , officials issued hurricane warnings from the Florida Keys through Apalachicola . A hurricane watch and gale warning were issued for the state 's eastern coastline , extending to Savannah , Georgia . In Key West , residents boarded up houses , and about 1 @,@ 000 people fled to the region 's 11 shelters . The MIM @-@ 23 Hawk antiaircraft missiles in the city were moved to higher ground , having been in place since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis . Further north , officials ordered the evacuation of Captiva Island and Sanibel Island . The causeways to Sanibel Island were closed , isolating residents who had not evacuated . Ten emergency shelters were opened in Fort Myers and two in Naples . Overall , about 100 @,@ 000 people were advised to seek shelter , though many of them chose to stay in their homes . All Phantom jet fighters at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa were transported to Columbus Air Force Base in Mississippi , while aircraft were also evacuated from Homestead Air Reserve Base . Because Alma was initially forecast to cross the central portion of the state , residents along the Florida panhandle were not adequately prepared for the hurricane . Just hours before the storm moved ashore , officials ordered evacuations for residents in low @-@ lying areas around Apalachicola . 
 One week before a scheduled hurricane preparedness drill at Kennedy Space Center , Alma presented the facility with an actual storm threat . A full @-@ scale version of a Saturn V rocket was rolled back to the Vehicle Assembly Building on June 8 in less than 11 hours , which was within the anticipated time for such a move and before the expected arrival of 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) wind gusts . Two other rockets were also removed from their pads . 
 = = Impact = = 
 During its formative stages , Alma produced heavy rainfall for several days across Central America , primarily in Nicaragua and Honduras . Overnight on June 5 , the city of San Rafael , Honduras recorded about 30 in ( 760 mm ) of precipitation , possibly in relation to a localized cloudburst . The extreme rainfall flooded the entire city and left most of it covered with about 3 ft ( 1 m ) of mud . Most of San Rafael was destroyed , and there were at 73 deaths in the city ; one news report indicated that 75 people died in the city . Many rivers in Honduras became swollen at the height of the storm . On Swan Island , offshore northern Honduras , the storm dropped 14 @.@ 28 in ( 363 mm ) of rain . There was little damage on the island . 
 Before affecting Cuba , Alma spawned a tornado in Cayman Brac that destroyed a few houses and power lines . On Isla de la Juventud , the combination of high winds and rains destroyed dairy facilities , chicken farms , and large areas of fruit crops . The storm also destroyed a large radio tower on the island . When Alma struck Cuba , it produced high tides in southern La Habana Province that destroyed many fishing boats and wharves . Several towns along the coastline were flooded during the storm . The hurricane crossed western Cuba while strengthening . The Havana Institute of Meteorology recorded winds of 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 980 mbar ( 29 inHg ) . The strong winds knocked down trees and power lines , including in the capital city of Havana where hundreds of trees fell . The city had power outages and damage to its water systems . More than 1 @,@ 000 houses were damaged in Havana . Many of them were poorly constructed due to lack of government funding to repair the gradually deteriorating structures in the tropical climate . High winds sank a boat in Pinar del Río Province ; one of the occupants drowned , and the other two swam to shore . 
 Alma caused significant crop damage in western Cuba ; it destroyed 13 @,@ 400 acres ( 5 @,@ 400 hectares ) of bananas and 18 @,@ 090 acres ( 7 @,@ 320 hectares ) of corn fields . There were also heavy losses to fruit trees and to the sugar industry , after the storm destroyed sugar mills and the rail lines that carried the cane to the mills . The storm destroyed over 100 tobacco drying barns , including their contents . The destruction of the tobacco represented a $ 30 million loss for the country . High winds also destroyed 96 tobacco storage facilities , although the tobacco was removed beforehand . In Güines near Havana , Alma destroyed food crops , which further exacerbated Cuba 's existing food shortages . Alma 's passage also resulted in water shortages , prompting the government to urge residents to use less water . There was heavy structural damage across western Cuba , including in Havana , Matanzas , Camagüey , Pinar del Río , and Las Villas . The hurricane destroyed 1 @,@ 083 houses , and overall damage was estimated at $ 200 million . Alma killed 12 people in the country and injured 78 others . In the storm 's aftermath , Cuban officials sent about 100 @,@ 000 people from Havana to the cities around the capital to repair storm damage . Such forced labor was a complaint about the rule of Fidel Castro , after the food and supply shortages . 
 Hurricane Alma affected the entire state of Florida with strong winds and rainfall . While the hurricane passed east of the Dry Tortugas , a station recorded winds of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) , which were the highest winds on land . The station also recorded a pressure of 970 mbar ( 29 inHg ) , which was the lowest pressure recorded on land . Wind gusts reached 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) in Key West , causing a power outage . Rising tides flooded streets in the city , including A1A which sustained damage to an adjacent seawall . Damage in the lower Florida Keys was estimated at around $ 300 @,@ 000 . In southwestern Florida , the hurricane heavily damaged the mango crop . High rainfall totals occurred across the state , peaking at 9 @.@ 94 in ( 252 mm ) in Dania Beach near Miami . There were eight tornadoes or funnel clouds in the state , including one in Dade County that damaged a home . Along the west coast of Pinellas County , the storm damaged the grapefruit crop . High winds , including a gust of 93 mph ( 150 km / h ) , caused power outages in the Tampa Bay Area . A wind gust knocked a car off of a bridge between Tampa and St. Petersburg , although the occupants were able to escape safely . As it paralleled the coastline , Alma produced a storm tide of 10 ft ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) in New Port Richey . The high tides caused significant flooding in Cedar Key . In northern Florida where Alma moved ashore , wind gusts reached 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) in Crawfordville ; the high winds damaged the local tobacco crop . There were six deaths , of which two were electrocutions , two were drownings , and two were from heart attacks related to the storm . One of the deaths was a man who had a heart attack while preparing to evacuate . Damage throughout Florida was estimated at around $ 10 million . This was less than other storms of similar intensity , due to the sparse population of the affected area . 
 Further north , Alma produced 44 mph ( 71 km / h ) wind gusts and 2 @.@ 18 in ( 55 mm ) in Savannah , Georgia . High winds damaged a few houses and downed trees near Albany , Georgia . The winds overturned a bus at Fort Gordon , injuring 11 soldiers . The storm caused about $ 50 @,@ 000 in damage in the state . Effects were minor in South Carolina , although heavy rainfall totaled 7 @.@ 80 in ( 198 mm ) in Wilmington , North Carolina . Rainfall and increased storm tides extended into Virginia and New Jersey . 
 = Bill Clinton = 
 William Jefferson Clinton ( born William Jefferson Blythe III ; August 19 , 1946 ) is an American politician who was the 42nd President of the United States from 1993 to 2001 . Clinton was previously Governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and 1983 to 1992 , and the Arkansas Attorney General from 1977 to 1979 . A member of the Democratic Party , ideologically Clinton was a New Democrat , and many of his policies reflected a centrist " Third Way " political philosophy . 
 Clinton was born and raised in Arkansas , and is an alumnus of Georgetown University , where he was a member of Kappa Kappa Psi and Phi Beta Kappa and earned a Rhodes Scholarship to attend the University of Oxford . Clinton is married to Hillary Clinton , who served as United States Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013 , and who was a Senator from New York from 2001 to 2009 , and is the Democratic nominee for president in 2016 . Both Clintons earned law degrees from Yale Law School , where they met and began dating . As Governor of Arkansas , Clinton overhauled the state 's education system , and served as chairman of the National Governors Association . 
 Clinton was elected President in 1992 , defeating incumbent George H. W. Bush . At age 46 , Clinton was the third @-@ youngest president , and the first from the Baby Boomer Generation . Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history , and signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement . After failing to pass national health care reform , the Democratic House was ousted when the Republican Party won control of the Congress in 1994 , for the first time in 40 years . Two years later , Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected President twice . Clinton passed Welfare Reform and the State Children 's Health Insurance Program , providing health coverage for millions of children . He was reelected to a second term in 1996 . 
 In 1998 , Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for perjury before a grand jury and obstruction of justice during a lawsuit against him , both related to a scandal involving White House ( and later Department of Defense ) employee Monica Lewinsky . Clinton was acquitted by the U.S. Senate in 1999 , and served his complete term of office . The Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus between the years 1998 and 2000 , the last three years of Clinton 's presidency . In foreign policy , Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnia and Kosovo wars , signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein , and participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli – Palestinian peace process . 
 Clinton left office with the highest end @-@ of @-@ office approval rating of any U.S. President since World War II . Since then , Clinton has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work . Clinton created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address international causes , such as the prevention of AIDS and global warming . In 2004 , Clinton published his autobiography My Life . Clinton has remained active in politics by campaigning for Democratic candidates , including his wife 's campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 and 2016 , and Barack Obama 's presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012 . 
 In 2009 , Clinton was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti , and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake , Clinton teamed with George W. Bush to form the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund . Since leaving office , Clinton has been rated highly in public opinion polls of U.S. Presidents . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19 , 1946 , at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope , Arkansas . Clinton 's father , William Jefferson Blythe Jr . ( 1910 – 1946 ) , was a traveling salesman who died in an automobile accident three months before Clinton was born . His mother , Virginia Dell ( née Cassidy ; 1923 – 1994 ) , traveled to New Orleans to study nursing soon after he was born . She left Clinton in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy , who owned and ran a small grocery store . At a time when the Southern United States was segregated racially , Clinton 's grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races . In 1950 , Bill 's mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton Sr. , who owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs , Arkansas , with his brother and Earl T. Ricks . The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950 . 
 Although he immediately assumed use of his stepfather 's surname , it was not until Clinton turned fifteen that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather . Clinton says he remembers his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half @-@ brother , Roger Clinton Jr . , to the point where he intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them . 
 In Hot Springs , Clinton attended St. John 's Catholic Elementary School , Ramble Elementary School , and Hot Springs High School — where he was an active student leader , avid reader , and musician . Clinton was in the chorus and played the tenor saxophone , winning first chair in the state band 's saxophone section . He briefly considered dedicating his life to music , but as he noted in his autobiography My Life : 
 Sometime in my sixteenth year , I decided I wanted to be in public life as an elected official . I loved music and thought I could be very good , but I knew I would never be John Coltrane or Stan Getz . I was interested in medicine and thought I could be a fine doctor , but I knew I would never be Michael DeBakey . But I knew I could be great in public service . 
 Clinton 's interest in law also began in Hot Springs High , when in his Latin class he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient Roman Senator Catiline in a mock trial . After a vigorous defense that made use of his " budding rhetorical and political skills " , he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck that it " made him realize that someday he would study law . " 
 Clinton has named two influential moments in his life that contributed to his decision to become a public figure , both occurring in 1963 . One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F. Kennedy . The other was watching Martin Luther King , Jr . ' s 1963 I Have a Dream speech on TV , which impressed him enough that he later memorized it .

 With the aid of scholarships , Clinton attended the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington , D.C. , receiving a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service ( B.S. ) degree in 1968 . In 1964 and 1965 he won elections for class president . From 1964 to 1967 he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright . While in college , he became a brother of co @-@ ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa . Clinton was also a member of the Order of <unk> , a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry , but he never became a Freemason . He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi honorary band fraternity . 
 = = = Rhodes Scholar = = = 
 Upon graduation , he won a Rhodes Scholarship to University College , Oxford where he studied Philosophy , Politics and Economics , though because he had switched programs and had left early for Yale University , he did not receive a degree there . He developed an interest in rugby union , playing at Oxford and later for the Little Rock Rugby club in Arkansas . 
 = = = Vietnam War opposition and draft controversy = = = 
 While at Oxford he also participated in Vietnam War protests and organized an October 1969 Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam event . 
 Clinton received Vietnam War draft deferments during 1968 and 1969 while he was in England . Planning to attend law school in the U.S , and aware that he might lose his draft deferment , he tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the National Guard or Air Force , and then made arrangements to join the Reserve Officers ' Training Corps ( ROTC ) program at the University of Arkansas . 
 He subsequently decided not to join the ROTC , saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program he had planned to join that he opposed the war , but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC , National Guard , or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam . He further stated that because he opposed the war , he would not volunteer to serve in uniform , but would subject himself to the draft , and would serve if selected only as a way " to maintain my political viability within the system . " Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number ( 311 ) , meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers 1 to 310 would have to be drafted before him , making it unlikely that he would be drafted . ( In fact , the highest number drafted was 195 . ) 
 Colonel Eugene Holmes , the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton 's ROTC application , suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform . He issued a notarized statement during the 1992 presidential campaign : 
 I was informed by the draft board that it was of interest to Senator Fulbright 's office that Bill Clinton , a Rhodes Scholar , should be admitted to the ROTC program ... I believe that he purposely deceived me , using the possibility of joining the ROTC as a ploy to work with the draft board to delay his induction and get a new draft classification . 
 During the 1992 campaign it was revealed that Clinton 's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve , which would have kept him from going to Vietnam . This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then . Although legal , Clinton 's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans during his first presidential campaign , some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright 's influence to avoid military service . Clinton 's 1992 campaign manager , James Carville , successfully argued that Clinton 's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public , insisting that voters , many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War , would understand and appreciate his position . 
 = = = Law school = = = 
 After Oxford , Clinton attended Yale Law School and earned a Juris Doctor ( J.D. ) degree in 1973 . In the Yale Law Library in 1971 he met fellow law student Hillary Rodham , who was a year ahead of him . They began dating and soon were inseparable . After only about a month , Clinton postponed his plans to be a coordinator for the George McGovern campaign for the 1972 United States presidential election in order to move in with her in California . They married on October 11 , 1975 , and their only child , Chelsea , was born on February 27 , 1980 . 
 Clinton did eventually move to Texas with Rodham to take a job leading George McGovern 's effort there in 1972 . He spent considerable time in Dallas , at the campaign 's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue , where he had an office . Clinton worked with future two @-@ term mayor of Dallas , Ron Kirk , future governor of Texas , Ann Richards , and then unknown television director ( and future filmmaker ) Steven Spielberg .

 After graduating from Yale Law School , Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas . In 1974 he ran for the House of Representatives . Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt , Clinton 's campaign was bolstered by the anti @-@ Republican and anti @-@ incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal . Hammerschmidt , who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972 , defeated Clinton by only a 52 percent to 48 percent margin . In 1976 Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General . With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election , Clinton was elected . 
 Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1978 , having defeated the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe , a farmer from Texarkana . He became the youngest governor in the country at 32 . Due to his youthful appearance , Clinton was often called the " Boy Governor " . He worked on educational reform and Arkansas 's roads , with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform . However , his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens ' anger over the escape of Cuban refugees ( from the Mariel <unk> ) detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980 . Monroe Schwarzlose of Kingsland in Cleveland County , polled 31 percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980 . Some suggested Schwarzlose 's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton 's defeat in the general election that year by Republican challenger Frank D. White . As Clinton once joked , he was the youngest ex @-@ governor in the nation 's history . 
 Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey 's Little Rock law firm of Wright , Lindsey and Jennings . In 1982 , he was again elected governor and kept the office for ten years ; beginning with the 1986 election , Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years . During his term he helped transform Arkansas 's economy and improved the state 's educational system . For senior citizens , he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property @-@ tax exemption . He became a leading figure among the New Democrats , a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform , smaller government , and other policies not supported by liberals . Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council ( DLC ) , the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan 's landslide victory in 1984 , the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level . Clinton delivered the Democratic response to President Reagan 's 1985 State of the Union Address and served as Chair of the National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987 , bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas . 
 In the early 1980s , Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority . Chaired by Clinton 's wife Hillary Rodham Clinton , also an attorney and chair of the Legal Services Corporation , the Arkansas Education Standards Committee transformed Arkansas 's education system from the worst in the United States to one of the best . Proposed reforms included more spending for schools ( supported by a sales @-@ tax increase ) , better opportunities for gifted children , vocational education , higher teachers ' salaries , more course variety , and compulsory teacher competency exams . The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session — the longest in Arkansas history . Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship . He defeated four Republican candidates for governor : Lowe ( 1978 ) , White ( 1982 and 1986 ) , Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman ( 1984 ) , and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock ( 1990 ) . 
 The Clintons ' personal and business affairs in the 1980s included transactions that became the basis of the Whitewater controversy investigation that later dogged his presidential administration . After extensive investigation over several years , no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas . 
 According to some sources , Clinton was in his early years a death penalty opponent who switched positions . During Clinton 's term , Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 ( the death penalty had been re @-@ enacted on March 23 , 1973 ) . As Governor , he oversaw four executions : one by electric chair and three by lethal injection . Later , as president , Clinton was the first President to pardon a death @-@ row inmate since the federal death penalty was reintroduced in 1988 .

 In 1987 , there was media speculation Clinton would enter the race after then @-@ New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front @-@ runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity . Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor ( following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor , initially favored — but ultimately vetoed — by the First Lady ) . For the nomination , Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis . He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention , but his speech , which was 33 minutes long and twice as long as it was expected to be , was criticized for being too long and poorly delivered . Presenting himself as a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party , he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991 .

 During his presidency , Clinton advocated for a wide variety of legislation and programs , much of which was enacted into law or was implemented by the executive branch . His policies , particularly the North American Free Trade Agreement and welfare reform , have been attributed to a centrist Third Way philosophy of governance . On budgetary matters his policy of fiscal conservatism helped to reduce deficits . Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history . The Congressional Budget Office reported budget surpluses of $ 69 billion in 1998 , $ 126 billion in 1999 , and $ 236 billion in 2000 , during the last three years of Clinton 's presidency . The U.S. treasury reported a debt of $ 5 @.@ 413 trillion in 1997 , and a debt of $ 5 @.@ 656 trillion in 1999 . At the end of his presidency , Clinton moved to New York and helped his wife win election to the U.S. Senate there .

 In the first primary contest , the Iowa Caucus , Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa Senator Tom Harkin . During the campaign for the New Hampshire primary , reports of an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers surfaced . As Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls , following Super Bowl XXVI , Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges . Their television appearance was a calculated risk , but Clinton regained several delegates . He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary , but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning , the media viewed it as a victory . News outlets labeled him " The Comeback Kid " for earning a firm second @-@ place finish . 
 Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the Southern primaries on Super Tuesday gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead . However , former California Governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South . With no major Southern state remaining , Clinton targeted New York , which had many delegates . He scored a resounding victory in New York City , shedding his image as a regional candidate . Having been transformed into the consensus candidate , he secured the Democratic Party nomination , finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown 's home state of California . 
 During the campaign , questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm , at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner , arose . Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary 's firm pay . Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that , with Hillary , voters would be getting two presidents " for the price of one " . 
 While campaigning for U.S. President , the then @-@ Governor Clinton returned to Arkansas to see that Ricky Ray Rector would be executed . After killing a police officer and a civilian , Rector shot himself in the head , leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death . According to Arkansas state and Federal law , a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed . The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution . Clinton 's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in a The New York Times article as a possible political move to counter " soft on crime " accusations . 
 Because Bush 's approval ratings were around 80 percent during the Gulf War , he was described as unbeatable . However , when Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits , he reneged on his promise not to raise taxes , hurting his approval rating . Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep . By election time , the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40 percent . Finally , conservatives were previously united by anti @-@ communism , but with the end of the Cold War , the party lacked a uniting issue . When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention — with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform — many moderates were alienated . Clinton then pointed to his moderate , " New Democrat " record as governor of Arkansas , though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious . Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton . Clinton and his running mate , Al Gore , toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign , shoring up support and pledging a " new beginning " . 
 Clinton won the 1992 presidential election ( 43 @.@ 0 percent of the vote ) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush ( 37 @.@ 4 percent of the vote ) and billionaire populist Ross Perot , who ran as an independent ( 18 @.@ 9 percent of the vote ) on a platform focusing on domestic issues ; a significant part of Clinton 's success was Bush 's steep decline in public approval . Clinton 's election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty @-@ four years . The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress , the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter .

 Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20 , 1993 . Shortly after taking office , Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 on February 5 , which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition . This action had bipartisan support , and proved quite popular with the public . 
 Two days after taking office , on January 22 , 1993 — the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade , Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international family planning programs that had been imposed by Clinton 's predecessors , Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush . Clinton said that abortion should be kept " safe , legal , and rare " — a slogan that had been suggested by University of California , San Diego political scientist Samuel L. <unk> and first used by Clinton in December 1991 , while campaigning . During the eight years of the Clinton administration , the U.S. abortion rate declined by about 18 @.@ 4 percent . 
 On February 15 , 1993 , Clinton made his first address to the nation , announcing his plan to raise taxes to cap the budget deficit . Two days later , in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress , Clinton unveiled his economic plan . The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class , which had been high on his campaign agenda . Clinton 's advisers pressured him to raise taxes on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates . 
 On May 19 , 1993 , Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office , causing the White House travel office controversy even though the Travel Office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be dismissed without cause . The White House responded to the controversy by claiming the firings were done because of financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation . Critics contended the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and that the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted . 
 Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 in August of that year , which passed Congress without a Republican vote . It cut taxes for fifteen million low @-@ income families , made tax cuts available to 90 percent of small businesses , and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1 @.@ 2 percent of taxpayers . Additionally , through the implementation of spending restraints , it mandated the budget be balanced over a number of years . 
 Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding a health care reform plan on September 22 , 1993 , aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan . This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton 's legislative agenda , and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton . Though at first well received in political circles , it was eventually doomed by well @-@ organized opposition from conservatives , the American Medical Association , and the health insurance industry . However , John F. Harris , a biographer of Clinton 's , states the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House . Despite the Democratic majority in Congress , the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994 . It was the first major legislative defeat of Clinton 's administration . 
 In November 1993 , David Hale , the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy , alleged that Clinton , while governor of Arkansas , pressured him to provide an illegal $ 300 @,@ 000 loan to Susan McDougal , the partner of the Clintons in the Whitewater land deal . A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation did result in convictions against the <unk> for their role in the Whitewater project , but the Clintons themselves were never charged , and Clinton maintains innocence in the affair . 
 Clinton signed the Brady Bill into law on November 30 , 1993 , which mandated federal background checks on firearm purchasers in the United States , and imposed a five @-@ day waiting period on purchases , until the NICS system was implemented in 1998 .. He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit , a subsidy for low @-@ income workers . 
 In December of that year , allegations by Arkansas state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in the American Spectator . Later known as Troopergate , the allegations by these men were that they arranged sexual liaisons for Bill Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas . The story mentioned a woman named Paula , a reference to Paula Jones . Brock later apologized to Clinton , saying the article was politically motivated " bad journalism " and that " the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives . " 
 That month , Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as " Don 't Ask , Don 't Tell " , which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexuality a secret , and forbade the military from inquiring about an individual 's sexual orientation . The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton 's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats , including Senators John McCain ( R @-@ AZ ) and Sam Nunn ( D @-@ GA ) . According to David <unk> , Clinton 's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore , who felt that " the President should lift the ban ... even though [ his executive order ] was sure to be overridden by the Congress " . Some gay @-@ rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions . Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order , noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces . Clinton 's defenders argue that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law , potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future . Later in his presidency , in 1999 , Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented , saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not " out of whack " . The policy remained controversial , and was finally repealed in 2011 , removing open sexual preference as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces . 
 On January 1 , 1994 , Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law . Throughout his first year in office , Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate . Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures ; there remained , however , strong disagreement within the party . Opposition came chiefly from anti @-@ trade Republicans , protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot . The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed ( 132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor ; 156 Democrats , 43 Republicans , and 1 independent against ) . The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the President . 
 The Omnibus Crime Bill , which Clinton signed into law in September 1994 , made many changes to U.S. crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death , such as running a large @-@ scale drug enterprise . During Clinton 's re @-@ election campaign he said , " My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins , murderers of federal law enforcement officers , and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons . " It also included a subsection of assault weapons ban for a ten @-@ year period . 
 The Clinton administration also launched the first official White House website , <unk> , on October 21 , 1994 . It was followed by three more versions , resulting in the final edition launched in 2000 . The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web @-@ based communication . According to Robert Longley , " Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies , the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet , thus opening up America 's government to more of America 's citizens than ever before . On July 17 , 1996 , Clinton issued Executive Order <unk> – Federal Information Technology , ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public . " 
 After two years of Democratic Party control , the Democrats lost control of Congress in the mid @-@ term elections in 1994 , for the first time in forty years . 
 The White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to FBI security @-@ clearance documents . Craig Livingstone , head of the White House Office of Personnel Security , improperly requested , and received from the FBI , background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals ; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations . In March 2000 , Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined that there was no credible evidence of any crime . Ray 's report further stated , " there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved " in seeking the files . 
 On September 21 , 1996 , Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) , which defines marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman , allowing individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages performed in other states . Paul <unk> , speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office , said that Clinton 's signing of DOMA " was a political decision that they made at the time of a re @-@ election . " In defense of his actions , Clinton has said that DOMA was an attempt to " head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states " , a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a " very reactionary Congress . " Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said , " ... the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse , and it was time to move on and get the president re @-@ elected . " Clinton himself stated that DOMA was something " which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for President Bush up , I think it 's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that . " Others were more critical . The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims " historic revisionism " . In a July 2 , 2011 editorial The New York Times opined , " The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election @-@ year wedge issue , signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments . " . Ultimately , in United States v. Windsor , the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013 . 
 Despite DOMA , Clinton was the first President to select openly gay persons for Administration positions , and is generally credited as the first President to publicly champion gay rights . During his Presidency , Clinton controversially issued two substantial executive orders on behalf of gay rights , the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce . Under President Clinton 's leadership , federal funding for HIV / AIDS research , prevention and treatment more than doubled . And Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sector Employment Non @-@ Discrimination Act , which , buoyed by his lobbying , failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996 . Advocacy for these issues , paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time , led to enthusiastic support for Clinton 's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign . Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009 and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013 . He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro @-@ gay stances and his reversal on DOMA . 
 The 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) to influence the domestic policies of the United States , before and during the Clinton administration , and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself . The Chinese government denied all accusations . 
 As part of a 1996 initiative to curb illegal immigration , Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act ( <unk> ) on September 30 , 1996 . Appointed by Clinton , the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800 @,@ 000 people a year to about 550 @,@ 000 . 
 Ken Gormley , author of The Death of American Virtue : Clinton vs. Starr , reveals in his book that President Clinton narrowly escaped possible assassination in the Philippines in November 1996 . During his visit to the Asia @-@ Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) forum in Manila , while he was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government , Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device ( IED ) . According to officials , the IED was large enough to " blow up the entire presidential motorcade " . Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by Lewis C. Merletti , former member of the Presidential Protection Detail and Director of the Secret Service . Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating that there was a wedding cake under a bridge . This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton 's motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila . Once more , the word " wedding " was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt . Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade , but the alternate route would add forty @-@ five minutes to the drive time . Clinton was very angry , as he was already late for the meeting , but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life . Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high . Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag . Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base . The President was scheduled to visit both of these locations later in the week . An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as al @-@ Qaeda and the plot was masterminded by Osama bin Laden . Until recently , this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret . Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events .

 In the 1996 presidential election , Clinton was re @-@ elected , receiving 49 @.@ 2 percent of the popular vote over Republican Bob Dole ( 40 @.@ 7 percent of the popular vote ) and Reform candidate Ross Perot ( 8 @.@ 4 percent of the popular vote ) , becoming the first Democratic incumbent since Lyndon Johnson to be elected to a second term and the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected President more than once . The Republicans lost three seats in the House and gained two in the Senate , but retained control of both houses of the 105th United States Congress . Clinton received 379 , or over 70 percent of the Electoral College votes , with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes .

 In the January 1997 State of the Union address , Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide coverage to up to five million children . Senators Ted Kennedy — a Democrat — and Orrin Hatch — a Republican — teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997 , and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children 's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) , the largest ( successful ) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency . That year , Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act . He negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress . In October 1997 , he announced he was getting hearing aids , due to hearing loss attributed to his age , and his time spent as a musician in his youth . In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm – Leach – Bliley Act , which repealed the part of the Glass – Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment , commercial banking , and insurance services since its enactment in 1933 . 
 = = = = Impeachment and acquittal = = = = 
 After the 1998 elections , the House impeached Clinton , alleging perjury and obstruction of justice related to the Lewinsky scandal . Clinton was only the second U.S. President to be impeached , after Andrew Johnson . Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22 @-@ year @-@ old White House ( and later Department of Defense ) employee Monica Lewinsky . After the Starr Report was submitted to the House providing what it termed " substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May <unk> Grounds for an Impeachment " , the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the mid @-@ term elections . To hold impeachment proceedings , the Republican leadership called a lame @-@ duck session in December 1998 . 
 While the House Judiciary Committee hearings ended in a straight party @-@ line vote , there was lively debate on the House floor . The two charges passed in the House ( largely with Republican support , but with a handful of Democratic votes as well ) were for perjury and obstruction of justice . The perjury charge arose from Clinton 's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Paula Jones 's sexual harassment lawsuit . The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition . 
 The Senate later acquitted Clinton on both charges . The Senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term , so the trial was held over until the next Congress . Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams & Connolly . The Senate finished a twenty @-@ one @-@ day trial on February 12 , 1999 , with the vote of 55 Not Guilty / 45 Guilty on the perjury charge and 50 Not Guilty / 50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge . Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two @-@ thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder . The final vote was generally along party lines , with no Democrats voting guilty , and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty . 
 On January 19 , 2001 , Clinton 's law license was suspended for five years after he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court that he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in the Jones case .

 Clinton controversially issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20 , 2001 . Most of the controversy surrounded Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton 's brother , Hugh Rodham , accepted payments in return for influencing the president 's decision @-@ making regarding the pardons . Federal prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed to investigate the pardon of Rich . She was later replaced by then @-@ Republican James Comey , who found no wrongdoing on Clinton 's part . Some of Clinton 's pardons remain a point of controversy .

 Many military events occurred during Clinton 's presidency . The Battle of Mogadishu occurred in Somalia in 1993 . During the operation , two U.S. helicopters were shot down by rocket @-@ propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors , trapping soldiers behind enemy lines . This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers , wounded 73 others , and one was taken prisoner . There were many more Somali casualties . Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets — a spectacle broadcast on television news programs . In response , U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground . In 1995 , U.S. and NATO aircraft attacked Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and to pressure them into a peace accord . Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995 , to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement . 
 In February 1996 , the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US $ 131 @.@ 8 million in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the International Court of Justice after the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser . 
 Capturing Osama bin Laden had been an objective of the U.S. government during the presidency of Bill Clinton ( and continued to be until bin Laden 's death in 2011 ) . Despite claims by Mansoor Ijaz and Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden and that that U.S. authorities rejected each offer the 9 / 11 Commission Report stated that " we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim . " 
 In response to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden and the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa by al @-@ Qaeda ( which killed 224 people , including 12 Americans ) , Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden , both of which were unsuccessful . In August 1998 , Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan , targeting the Al @-@ Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan , which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons , and bin Laden 's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan . 
 To stop the ethnic cleansing and genocide of Albanians by anti @-@ guerilla military units in the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 's province of Kosovo , Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999 , named Operation Allied Force . General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission . With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 , the bombing campaign ended on June 10 , 1999 . The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region . NATO announced that its forces had suffered zero combat deaths , and two deaths from an Apache helicopter crash . Opinions in the popular press criticized pre @-@ war genocide statements by the Clinton administration as greatly exaggerated . In 2001 , the <unk> Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide did not take place , but recognized " a systematic campaign of terror , including murders , rapes , arsons and severe <unk> . " The term " ethnic cleansing " was used as an alternative to " genocide " to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement , though critics charge there is no difference . Slobodan Milošević , the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities , was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges of crimes against humanity , genocide , and war crimes . Milošević died in 2006 , before the completion of the trial . 
 In Clinton 's 1998 State of the Union Address , he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons : 
 Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade , and much of his nation 's wealth , not on providing for the Iraqi people , but on developing nuclear , chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them . The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job , finding and destroying more of Iraq 's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war . Now , Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission . I know I speak for everyone in this chamber , Republicans and Democrats , when I say to Saddam Hussein , " You cannot defy the will of the world " , and when I say to him , " You have used weapons of mass destruction before ; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again . 
 Seeking to weaken Hussein 's grip on power , Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 into law on October 31 , 1998 , which instituted a policy of " regime change " against Iraq , though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces . The administration then launched a four @-@ day bombing campaign named Operation Desert Fox , lasting from December 16 to 19 , 1998 . At the end of this operation Clinton announced that " So long as Saddam remains in power , he will remain a threat to his people , his region , and the world . With our allies , we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program , while working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors . " American and British aircraft in the Iraq no @-@ fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times in 2000 . 
 Clinton 's November 2000 visit to Vietnam was the first by a U.S. president since the end of the Vietnam War . On October 10 , 2000 , Clinton signed into law the U.S. – China Relations Act of 2000 , which granted permanent normal trade relations ( <unk> ) trade status to People 's Republic of China . The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform . Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy . Under Clinton , the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969 . 
 After initial successes such as the Oslo Accords of the early 1990s , which also led to the Israel – Jordan peace treaty in 1994 and the Wye River Memorandum in October 1998 , Clinton attempted an effort to end the Israeli – Palestinian conflict . He brought Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat together at Camp David for the Camp David Summit in July 2000 , which lasted 14 days . Following the failures of the peace talks , Clinton stated Arafat " missed the opportunity " to facilitate a " just and lasting peace . " In his autobiography , Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit . Following another attempt in December 2000 at Bolling Air Force Base , in which the President offered the Clinton Parameters , the situation broke down completely after the end of the Taba Summit and with the start of the Second Intifada . 
 = = = Judicial appointments = = = 
 Clinton appointed two justices to the Supreme Court : Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993 and Stephen Breyer in 1994 . 
 Along with his two Supreme Court appointments , Clinton appointed 66 judges to the United States courts of appeals and 305 judges to the United States district courts . His 373 judicial appointments are the second most in American history behind those of Ronald Reagan . Clinton also experienced a number of judicial appointment controversies , as 69 nominees to federal judgeships did not receive a vote in the Republican @-@ controlled Senate Judiciary Committee . In all , 84 percent of his nominees were confirmed . 
 Among the judges appointed by Clinton to the courts of appeals was Sonia Sotomayor , who was nominated by Clinton in 1997 to the Second Circuit and confirmed in 1998 , following a delay of more than a year caused by Republican opposition . 
 Clinton was the first president in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts . In his eight years in office , 11 @.@ 6 % of Clinton 's court of appeals nominees and 17 @.@ 4 % of his district court nominees were black ; 32 @.@ 8 % of his court of appeals nominees and 28 @.@ 5 % of his district court nominees were women . Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit ( Roger Gregory ) and the Seventh Circuit ( Ann Claire Williams ) . Clinton also appointed the nation 's first openly gay or lesbian federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York . Batts was confirmed by the Senate in a voice vote in 1994 .

 Clinton 's job approval rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s throughout his first term . In his second term , his rating consistently ranged from the high @-@ 50s to the high @-@ 60s . After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999 , Clinton 's rating reached its highest point . According to a CBS News / New York Times poll , Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68 percent , which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era . Clinton 's average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61 % , the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years . Forty @-@ seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters . 
 As he was leaving office , a CNN / USA Today / Gallup poll revealed that 45 percent of Americans said they would miss him ; 55 percent thought he " would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life " ; 68 percent thought he would be remembered more for his " involvement in personal scandal " than for " his accomplishments " ; and 58 percent answered " No " to the question " Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy ? " The same percentage said he would be remembered as either " outstanding " or " above average " as a president , while 22 percent said he would be remembered as " below average " or " poor . " ABC News characterized public consensus on Clinton as , " You can 't trust him , he 's got weak morals and ethics – and he 's done a heck of a good job . " 
 In May 2006 , a CNN poll comparing Clinton 's job performance with that of his successor , George W. Bush , found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned . Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13 % of Americans as the greatest president in U.S. history . 
 In 2014 , 18 % of respondents in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II , making him the third most popular among postwar presidents , behind John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan . The same poll showed that just 3 % of American voters regarded Clinton as the worst president since World War II . 
 A 2015 poll by The Washington Post asked 162 scholars of the American Political Science Association to rank all the U.S. presidents in order of greatness . According to their findings , Clinton ranked eighth overall , with a rating of 70 percent .

 As the first baby boomer president , Clinton was the first president in more than half a century not to have been alive during World War II . Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward state Clinton 's innovative use of sound bite @-@ ready dialogue , personal charisma , and public perception @-@ oriented campaigning was a major factor in his high public approval ratings . When Clinton played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show , he was described by some religious conservatives as " the MTV president . " Opponents sometimes referred to him as " Slick Willie " , a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by Pine Bluff Commercial journalist Paul Greenberg ; Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as Winthrop Rockefeller , Dale Bumpers and David Pryor . The claim " Slick Willie " would last throughout his presidency . Standing at a height of 6 ft 2 in ( 1 @.@ 88 m ) , Clinton is tied with five others as the fourth @-@ tallest president in the nation 's history . His folksy manner led him to be nicknamed Bubba , especially in the South . Since 2000 , he has frequently been referred to as " The Big Dog " or " Big Dog . " His prominent role in campaigning for President Obama during the 2012 presidential election and his widely publicized speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention , where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Republican policies in detail , earned him the nickname " <unk> @-@ in @-@ Chief . " 
 Clinton drew strong support from the African American community and made improving race relations a major theme of his presidency . In 1998 , Nobel laureate Toni Morrison called Clinton " the first Black president " , saying , " Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness : single @-@ parent household , born poor , working @-@ class , saxophone @-@ playing , McDonald 's @-@ and @-@ junk @-@ food @-@ loving boy from Arkansas " . Noting that Clinton 's sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments , Morrison compared this to the stereotyping and double standards that blacks typically endure . 
 Shortly after he took office , conservative newspaper owner Richard Mellon Scaife organized a fundraising campaign to smear Clinton 's image in the media . Leading the Arkansas Project , Scaife and other associates sought to find sources in Clinton 's home state of Arkansas who would be willing to dish out negative allegations against the President . 
 In 1994 , Paula Jones brought a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton , claiming he made unwanted advances in 1991 , which he denied . In April 1998 , the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright as lacking legal merit . But Jones appealed Webber Wright 's ruling , and her suit gained traction following Clinton 's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998 . In 1998 , lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents contending a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas . Robert S. Bennett , Clinton 's main lawyer for the case , called the filing " a pack of lies " and " an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States " funded by Clinton 's political enemies . Clinton later agreed to an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement , paying $ 850 @,@ 000 . Bennett said that the President made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life . During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit , which was held at the White House , Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky – a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury . 
 In 1992 , Gennifer Flowers stated that she had a relationship with Clinton that began in 1980 . Flowers at first denied that she had an affair with Clinton , but later changed her story . After Clinton at first denied having a relationship with Flowers on 60 Minutes , he later admitted that he had a sexual encounter with Flowers . 
 In 1998 , Kathleen Willey alleged that Clinton groped her in a hallway in 1993 . An independent counsel determined Willey gave " false information " to the FBI , inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation . On March 19 , 1998 , Julie Hiatt Steele , a friend of Willey , released an affidavit , accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey 's account of being sexually groped by President Clinton in the Oval Office . An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct . Linda Tripp 's grand jury testimony also differed from Willey 's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances . 
 Also in 1998 , Juanita <unk> alleged that Clinton had raped her in the spring of 1978 , although she stated she did not remember the exact date . In another 1998 event , Elizabeth Gracen recanted a six @-@ year @-@ old denial and stated she had a one @-@ night stand with Clinton in 1982 . Gracen later apologized to Hillary Clinton . Throughout the year , however , Gracen eluded a subpoena from Kenneth Starr to testify her claim in court .

As part of the tsunami effort , these two ex @-@ presidents appeared in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre @-@ game show , and traveled to the affected areas . They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in 2007 . 
 Based on his philanthropic worldview , Clinton created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address issues of global importance . This foundation includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative ( <unk> ) , which strives to combat that disease , and has worked with the Australian government toward that end . The Clinton Global Initiative ( CGI ) , begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005 , attempts to address world problems such as global public health , poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict . In 2005 , Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools . Clinton 's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities , and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative . The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world , including Asia and the Middle East . In 2008 , Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti @-@ malaria drugs by 30 percent in developing nations . Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy , which was voted down .

 During the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign , Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife , Hillary Clinton . Through speaking engagements and fundraisers , he was able to raise $ 10 million toward her campaign . Some worried that as an ex @-@ president , he was too active on the trail , too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama , and alienating his supporters at home and abroad . Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary , which Obama won . Later in the 2008 primaries , there was some infighting between Bill and Hillary 's staffs , especially in Pennsylvania . Considering Bill 's remarks , many thought that he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary . Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama 's election . Fears were allayed August 27 , 2008 , when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention , saying that all his experience as president assures him that Obama is " ready to lead . " After Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign was over , Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt .

 = Old House of Keys = 
 The Old House of Keys ( Manx : <unk> @-@ <unk> y <unk> as Feed ) is the former meeting place of the House of Keys , the lower house of Tynwald , the Isle of Man 's parliament . It is located across the street from Castle Rushen in Castletown , the former capital of the Isle of Man , in the south of the island . The building was used as the House of Keys from 1821 until 1874 , when the parliament was moved to Douglas . 
 Prior to 1821 , the House of Keys had no official home , but met first at Castle Rushen , and later at the Bishop of Sodor and Man 's library in Castletown . After criticism from a Royal Commission , plans were drawn up for a new meeting house for the Keys in 1813 , but after concerns about the cost , they were redrawn and approved in 1819 . The building , designed by Thomas Brine , was completed in 1821 . It housed the House of Keys until 1874 , when the Keys followed the other primary functions of the island and moved to Douglas . After their move , the Old House became a branch of Dumbell 's Bank , and later Parr 's Bank . In 2000 , Manx National Heritage acquired the building and began restoring the house to how it appeared in 1866 . The building opened to the public as a museum in November 2001 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The parliament of the Isle of Man — Tynwald — is the oldest currently running parliament in the world . The first recorded meeting of Tynwald was in 979 , but could date back as far as the 8th century . Originally a 32 @-@ member Tynwald ruled over the Kingdom of the Isles , with half of its representatives coming from the Isle of Man . In the 12th century , this dropped to a 24 @-@ member Tynwald when the Isle of Mull and Islay were lost to Argyll . By the 16th century , Tynwald consisted of an upper and lower house ; the lower house being known as the 24 Keys . At this time , the members met irregularly at Castle Rushen , when called upon by either the Lord of Mann or one of his <unk> to help with legal and taxation issues . The Keys continued to meet at Castle Rushen until 1710 , when they moved to Thomas Wilson 's ( the Bishop of Sodor and Man ) library in Castletown . Late in the 18th century they still met in the library , of which a Royal Commission reported that " ... the Keys assemble in a mean decayed building little more than sufficient to contain the number which they consist . "

 = = = Construction = = = 
 Over twenty years after the Royal Commission 's damning report on the state of the library in which the Keys met , the Governor of the Isle of Man , John Murray , 4th Duke of Atholl , instructed Thomas Brine , the Clerk of Works for public buildings to cost and draw plans for a new House of Keys . These plans were rejected by the British Home Department and Treasury as too expensive , and despite repeated demands for a new meeting place , the proposal was put on hold . Brine carried out a survey of the library in 1817 at the request of the Keys , and condemned the building , resulting in the meetings of the Keys being held in a public house , the George Inn . Despite the comfort afforded by the building , it was criticised as being " ... highly improper for any Court of Justice and particularly so , for one of such importance in this Island as the House of Keys " as recorded in the Journal of the Keys in October 1817 . 
 Another design was requested of Brine , but this time for a smaller and less expensive building . In 1818 , the Keys purchased the building in which they had formerly met , moving the library to the Grammar School . The new plans were agreed upon by all concerned , but there continued to be disagreements between the British Treasury department and the Keys over how to fund the project . The Treasury believed that the cost should be covered by Manx taxes , but the Keys argued that this tax would be excessive . The two parties eventually agreed to pay some of the £ 1039 @-@ 10 @-@ 0d cost each , and the project was approved on 31 May 1819 , just under 30 years after the first discussions . The building was completed in less than two years , and the Keys started using the building in January 1821 . 
 = = = Operation = = = 
 Within a year of its completion , the House of Keys was heavily criticised in a letter to the Rising Sun newspaper . The external appearance of the building was described as bland and " more like that of a small country villa , or village jail , than a Senate House . " The interior was similarly lambasted , with particular attention being paid to the small space provided for the Speaker 's chair . During the Keys ' time in the building , they underwent one of their most significant changes . Until 1866 , the Keys were a self @-@ elected body , but following pressure from the public , most notably Isle of Man Times editor James Brown , the House agreed to be elected by popular vote . During the 1860s , Douglas became more prominent ; the Lieutenant Governor moved his residence there in 1861 , the Law Courts moved the following year , and by 1869 the town had replaced Castletown as the capital of the island . The House of Keys building in Castletown was described as too small , and " dilapidated with the wallpaper hanging off the wall . " In 1874 , the House of Keys moved to the Court House in Douglas , and five years later , into their current home , the Old Bank of Mona building also in Douglas . 
 = = = Later use = = = 
 After being vacated by the Keys , the building was purchased by Dumbell 's Bank . Not long after acquiring the building , the bank removed the ceiling from the chamber , and added a large skylight to create a grand banking hall . The building was repainted in an expensive shade of blue which was fashionable at the time . In 1900 , when Dumbell 's Bank collapsed , the building was taken over by Parr 's Bank . The render was stripped off the outside of the building sometime during the 1910s or 1920s , revealing the limestone underneath . In 1918 , the bank became part of Westminster Bank . In the 1960s , the upper floor of the chamber was replaced . The building was presented to the Castletown Commissioners in 1973 by the National Westminster Bank on the condition that it serve the town . It was used as the Town Hall until the opening of the Town Hall and Civic Centre in 1989 , and then as the Castletown Rural Library . 
 Manx National Heritage undertook the renovation of the building in 2000 and now run it as a museum . The building has been restored to its appearance in 1866 . That year was chosen as it was when the " House of Keys Election Bill " was passed , making the House of Keys a popularly elected body . In the absence of images depicting the interior , written descriptions were used , in conjunction with inventories . 
 = Battle of Frenchman 's Creek = 
 The Battle of Frenchman ’ s Creek took place during the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the United States in the early hours of November 28 , 1812 , in the Crown Colony of Upper Canada , near the Niagara River . The operation was conceived as a raid to prepare the ground for a larger American invasion . The Americans succeeded in crossing the Niagara and landing at both of their points of attack . They achieved one of their two objectives before withdrawing but the invasion was subsequently called off , rendering useless what had been accomplished . The engagement was named , “ the Battle of Frenchman ’ s Creek ” by the Canadians , after the location of some of the severest fighting . To contemporary Americans , it was known as , “ the Affair opposite Black Rock ” . 
 The battle site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1921 . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the American defeat at the Battle of Queenston Heights , command of the U.S. Army of the Centre on the Niagara Frontier passed from Major General Stephen Van Rensselaer of the New York Militia to his second @-@ in @-@ command , Brigadier General Alexander Smyth of the Regular U.S. Army . Smyth had deeply resented being subordinated to a militia officer and this was the opportunity for which he had been waiting . He immediately planned to invade Canada with 3 @,@ 000 troops . Assembling his forces at Buffalo , he directed a two @-@ pronged attack in advance of his main invasion . Captain William King , with 220 men , was to cross the Niagara and spike the batteries at the Red House , beside Fort Erie , in order to enable Smyth ’ s main invasion force to land without facing artillery fire . At the same time , Lieutenant Colonel Charles Boerstler , with 200 men , was to land in Canada between Fort Erie and Chippawa and destroy the bridge over Frenchman ’ s Creek in order to hinder the bringing @-@ up of British reinforcements to oppose Smyth 's landing . 
 The British commander @-@ in @-@ chief in North America , Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost , had forbidden any offensive action on the Niagara Frontier . This left the local British forces with no alternative but to wait for the Americans to make the first move and try to counter any attempt at invasion . The regular troops were distributed among the defensive outposts and supplemented with militia and Native American forces . 
 In a floridly worded proclamation , published on 10 November and addressed “ To The Men of New York ” , Smyth wrote that , “ in a few days the troops under my command will plant the American standard in Canada ” and he urged New Yorkers not to “ stand with your arms folded and look on in this interesting struggle ” but to “ advance … to our aid . I will wait for you a few days . ” Smyth ’ s statement of intent appears to have attracted no attention from his opponents across the border . 
 = = Opposing forces = = 
 Captain William King of the 13th U.S. Regiment of Infantry was detailed to attack the Red House with 150 troops and 70 U.S. Navy sailors under Lieutenant Samuel Angus . King ’ s soldiers came from Captain Willoughby Morgan ’ s company of the 12th U.S. Regiment of Infantry and Captains John <unk> and John E. Wool ’ s companies of the 13th Regiment . 
 Lieutenant Colonel Charles Boerstler was directed against Frenchman ’ s Creek with 200 men of his own 14th U.S. Regiment of Infantry . Colonel William H. Winder , commander of the 14th Regiment , was in reserve , with 350 of his own regiment . 
 The British local commander , Lieutenant Colonel Cecil Bisshopp , was stationed at Chippawa , with a company of the 1st Battalion , 41st Regiment of Foot , two infantry companies of the 5th Lincoln Militia and a small detachment of Lincoln Militia Artillery . More of the 5th Lincoln Militia under Major Richard Hatt were posted nearby . In the area that would face attack on December 26 , Bisshopp had several different detachments under his overall command . At Fort Erie were 80 of the 49th Regiment of Foot under Major Ormsby and 50 of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment under Captain Whelan . At Black Rock Ferry were two companies of Norfolk Militia under Captain John Bostwick . At the Red House , two @-@ and @-@ half miles from Fort Erie on the Chippawa Road , were 38 of the 49th Regiment under Lieutenant Thomas Lamont , some men of the Royal Regiment of Artillery under Lieutenant King , and some militia artillerymen . Lamont 's battery mounted two guns : an 18 @-@ pounder and a 24 @-@ pounder ; while King ’ s battery mounted a 6 @-@ pounder and a 3 @-@ pounder . Further along the Chippawa Road , about four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half miles from Fort Erie , lay the post at Frenchman ’ s Creek , garrisoned by 38 more men of the 49th Regiment under Lieutenant J. Bartley . Not far away were 70 of the light infantry company of the 41st Regiment under Lieutenant Angus McIntyre .

 Only part of Captain King ’ s force , including 35 of Lieutenant Angus 's 70 sailors , succeeded in making a landing at the Red House . Under fire from the defenders , the invaders charged Lieutenant Lamont ’ s detachment of the 49th Regiment . The sailors , armed with pikes and swords , closed in for hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting . Lamont 's troops drove back the attackers three times but King made a fourth assault which hit the British left flank and overwhelmed them ; capturing Lamont and killing , taking or dispersing all of his men . The victorious Americans set fire to the post , spiked the guns and set off back to the landing @-@ point , where they expected their boats to have re @-@ landed in order to evacuate them . However , in the moonless darkness , King ’ s force became dispersed and split into two parties : one led by King and the other by Lieutenant Angus . Angus returned to the landing @-@ point and found only four of the party ’ s ten boats there . Unaware that the six missing boats had not in fact landed , Angus assumed that King had already departed , and he re @-@ crossed the river in the remaining boats . When King ’ s party reached the landing @-@ point , they found themselves stranded . A search downriver found two unattended British boats , in which King sent half of his men , and the prisoners that he had captured , over the Niagara while he waited with his 30 remaining men for more boats to come from Buffalo and pick him up . 
 = = = Boerstler ’ s Attack = = = 
 Lieutenant Colonel Boerstler made for Frenchman ’ s Creek but four of his eleven boats , “ misled by the darkness of the night or the inexperienced rowers being unable to force them across the current , fell below , near the bridge and were forced to return ” . Nevertheless , Boerstler ’ s seven remaining boats forced a landing , opposed by Lieutenant Bartley and his 37 men of the 49th Regiment . Boerstler led the attack , shooting with his pistol a British soldier who was about to bayonet him . Bartley 's outnumbered force retired , pursued to the Frenchman 's Creek Bridge by the Americans , who took two prisoners . Boerstler 's men were then attacked by Captain Bostwick ’ s two companies of Norfolk Militia , who had advanced from Black Rock Ferry . After an exchange of fire in which Bostwick ’ s force lost 3 killed , 15 wounded and 6 captured , the Canadians retreated . Boerstler now encountered another problem : many of the axes provided for the destruction of the Frenchman ’ s Creek bridge were in the four boats that had turned back and those that were in the seven remaining boats had been left behind when the Americans fought their way ashore . Boerstler dispatched eight men under Lieutenant John Waring to “ break up the bridge by any means which they could find ” . Waring had torn up about a third of the planking on the bridge when it was learned from a prisoner that “ the whole force from Fort Erie was coming down upon them ” . Boerstler quickly re @-@ embarked his command and rowed back to Buffalo , leaving behind Waring and his party at the bridge .

 In response to the attack , Major Ormsby advanced from Fort Erie to Frenchman ’ s Creek with his 80 men of the 49th Regiment , where he was joined by Lieutenant McIntyre ’ s 70 light infantrymen , Major Hatt ’ s Lincoln Militia and some British @-@ allied Native Americans under Major Givins . Finding that Boerstler ’ s invaders had already gone , and being unable to determine any other enemy presence in the pitch dark , Ormsby ’ s 300 men remained in position until daybreak , when Lieutenant Colonel Bisshopp arrived from Fort Erie . Bisshopp led the force to the Red House , where they found Captain King and his men still waiting to be evacuated . Outnumbered by ten @-@ to @-@ one , King surrendered .

 When the news arrived in Buffalo that King had spiked the Red House batteries , General Smyth was overjoyed . " <unk> ! " he exclaimed , " Canada is ours ! Canada is ours ! Canada is ours ! This will be a glorious day for the United States ! " and he dispatched Colonel Winder with his 350 men across the river to evacuate King and the rest of his force . Winder collected Lieutenant Waring and his party and then landed . However , he had only disembarked part of his force when Bisshopp 's 300 men appeared . Winder ordered his men back to their boats and cast off for Buffalo but his command came under a severe fire as they rowed away , costing him 28 casualties . 
 In spiking the guns at the Red House battery , the Americans had accomplished the more important of their two objectives : an invading force could now land between Chippawa and Fort Erie without facing artillery fire . However , subsequent events would render their service useless . 
 = = Casualties = = 
 The British official casualty return gave 15 killed , 46 wounded and 30 missing . As was often done in casualty returns with officers ( but not with enlisted men ) , Lieutenant King of Royal Artillery and Lieutenant Lamont of the 49th were included in the “ wounded ” category although they were also taken prisoner . The Americans took 34 prisoners , including Lamont and King , which would indicate that two of the enlisted men who were thought to have been killed were in fact captured . This gives a revised British loss ( with Lamont and King counted among the prisoners rather than the wounded ) of 13 killed , 44 wounded and 34 captured . 
 Eaton ’ s Compilation states that Captain King ’ s command had 8 killed and 9 wounded ; that Colonel Winder ’ s detachment had 6 killed and 22 wounded but that the losses of Lieutenant Colonel Boerstler ’ s detachment were unknown , being “ nowhere stated ” in the records . The New York Gazette of December 15 , 1812 , reported that , of Lieutenant Angus ’ s 35 sailors who assaulted the Red House , 28 were killed or wounded , 2 were captured and only 5 escaped unscathed . Captain King ( who was slightly wounded in the foot ) and 38 other prisoners were taken by the British , The British reported that King and Angus ’ s detachment left 12 killed behind them at the Red House ( 4 of whom were presumably from Angus 's naval detachment ) and that 18 American dead were recovered altogether . Since only 30 prisoners had surrendered along with King and since Winder ’ s detachment did not come under fire until they had re @-@ embarked and cast off for Buffalo , it would appear that 6 of the dead left on the battlefield and 8 of the prisoners belonged to Boerstler ’ s command . The known American casualties ( which include the killed and captured but not the wounded in Boerstler 's detachment ) therefore appear to have been 24 killed , 55 wounded and 39 captured . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 With the Red House batteries out of action , Smyth immediately pressed on with his invasion plans . However , attempts to embark his 3 @,@ 000 men ended in chaos ; with only 1 @,@ 200 men managing to board because of a shortage of boats and the artillery taking up an unexpected amount of space on board . Amid torrential rain and freezing cold , a council of war headed by Smyth decided to postpone the invasion pending more thorough preparations that would enable the embarkation of whole force . 
 On November 31 , Smyth tried again , ordering his men to embark two hours before dawn in order to avoid enemy fire . This time , the embarkation was so slow that , two hours after daylight , only 1 @,@ 500 men were on board . Rather than attempt an amphibious landing in broad daylight , Smyth once again postponed the invasion . By this time , morale in Smyth ’ s command had plummeted : “ all discipline had dissolved ; the camp was a bedlam ” . This , and widespread illness among the troops , persuaded a second council of war called by Smyth to suspend all offensive operations until the army was reinforced . 
 The Army of the Centre went into winter quarters without attempting any further offensive operations and General Smyth requested leave to visit his family in Virginia . Three months later , without Smyth either resigning his commission or facing a court @-@ martial , his name was dropped from the U.S. Army rolls by President James Madison . 
 Unaware of the American intentions , the British and Canadians thought that King , Boerstler and Winder had been intended as the first wave of Smyth ’ s invasion rather than as a preparatory raid .

 = Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System = 
 The Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System ( ATCF ) is a piece of software originally developed to run on a personal computer for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) in 1988 , and the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) in 1990 . ATCF remains the main piece of forecasting software used for the United States Government , including the JTWC , NHC , and Central Pacific Hurricane Center . Other tropical cyclone centers in Australia and Canada developed similar software in the 1990s . The data files with ATCF lie within three decks , known as the a- , <unk> , and f @-@ decks . The a @-@ decks include forecast information , the b @-@ decks contain a history of center fixes at synoptic hours , and the f @-@ decks include the various fixes made by various analysis center at various times . In the years since its introduction , it has been adapted to Unix and Linux platforms . 
 = = Reason for development = = 
 The need for a more modernized method for forecasting tropical cyclones had become apparent by the mid @-@ 1980s . At that time Department of Defense was using acetate , grease pencils , and disparate computer programs to forecast tropical cyclones . The ATCF software was developed by the Naval Research Laboratory for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) beginning in 1986 , and used since 1988 . During 1990 the system was adapted by the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) for use at the NHC , National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center . This provided the NHC with a multitasking software environment which allowed them to improve efficiency and cut the time required to make a forecast by 25 % or 1 hour . ATCF was originally developed for use within DOS , before later being adapted to Unix and Linux . 
 = = Data decks used = = 
 An a @-@ deck is a data file that contains a listing of available forecast aid projections for a storm 's history . The real @-@ time guidance system uses a subset of the track and intensity information contained in these files to create the real @-@ time guidance plots . The a @-@ deck name comes from the fact that the <unk> start with an " a " . Normally , all the model projections are included for the entire lifetime of the storm , so these files can increase to around 1 megabyte in size . 
 A b @-@ deck is a data file that contains the history of past storms ' center locations , intensity , and other parameters at the six hourly synoptic times : 0000 , 0600 , 1200 , and 1800 UTC . The files can contain information outside of synoptic hours , such as the time of landfall . During hurricane season , these files contain the best operational estimates of these parameters , and are known as the operational best tracks . Once the season has completed , the files are updated with revised information after the storm history undergone a careful review by forecasters and other experts . The post @-@ season files are known as the best tracks . The real @-@ time portion of this web site will always feature the operational best tracks ( the ones which have not undergone any review ) . 
 An f @-@ deck is a data file that contains a record of the fixes of a storm 's location and / or intensity . A location fix is any position estimate of the storm center . An intensity fix is any estimate of the storm 's intensity . Both location and intensity fixes can be obtained by aircraft flying low @-@ level penetrations through the storm center . Various methods that use satellite imagery or other remote sensing can also provide location and intensity fixes . 
 = = System identification = = 
 Systems within ATCF are identified with the basin prefix ( AL , CP , EP , IO , SH , SL , WP ) and then followed by two digit number between 00 and 49 for active tropical cyclones , which becomes incremented with each new system , and then the year associated with the system . Numbers from 50 through 79 after the basin acronym are used internally by the basin 's respective Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers and Regional Specialized Meteorological Center . Numbers in the 80s are used for training purposes and can be reused . Numbers in the 90s are used for areas of interest , sometimes referred to as invests or areas of disturbed weather , and are also reused within any particular year . Their status is listed the following ways within the associated data file : DB - disturbance , TD - tropical depression , TS - tropical storm , TY - typhoon , ST - super typhoon , TC - tropical cyclone , HU - hurricane , SD - subtropical depression , SS - subtropical storm , EX - extratropical systems , IN - inland , DS - dissipating , LO - low , WV - tropical wave , ET - extrapolated , and XX - unknown .

 = The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs = 
 The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs ( 1876 ) is an epic poem of over 10 @,@ 000 lines by William Morris that tells the tragic story , drawn from the Volsunga Saga and the Elder Edda , of the Norse hero Sigmund , his son Sigurd ( the equivalent of Siegfried in the Nibelungenlied and Wagner 's Ring of the Nibelung ) and Sigurd 's wife Gudrun . It sprang from a fascination with the Volsung legend that extended back twenty years to the author 's youth , and had already resulted in several other literary and scholarly treatments of the story . It was Morris 's own favorite of his poems , and was enthusiastically praised both by contemporary critics and by such figures as T. E. Lawrence and George Bernard Shaw . In recent years it has been rated very highly by many William Morris scholars , but has never succeeded in finding a wide readership on account of its great length and archaic diction . It has been seen as an influence on such fantasy writers as Andrew Lang and J. R. R. Tolkien . The Story of Sigurd is available in modern reprints , both in its original form and in a cut @-@ down version , but there is no critical edition .

 The poem opens with the marriage of king Volsung 's daughter Signy to Siggeir , king of the Goths . The bridal feast is interrupted by the arrival of a stranger , the god Odin in disguise , who drives a sword into a tree @-@ trunk . Though everyone tries to draw the sword , Volsung 's son Sigmund is the only man who can do it . The disappointed Siggeir takes his new wife home , inviting Volsung to visit him . When Volsung does so he is killed by Siggeir , and his sons are taken prisoner . While in captivity they are all killed by a wolf , apart from Sigmund who escapes into the forest . Signy sends Sigmund her two sons to help him in avenging their family , but Sigmund only accepts Sinfjotli , the hardier of the two . Sigmund and Sinfjotli kill Siggeir and burn down his hall , then return to their ancestral home , the hall of the Volsungs . Sigmund marries Borghild , while Sinfjotli goes abroad with Borghild 's brother , quarrels with him , and kills him . On his return Sinfjotli is poisoned by Borghild , and she is turned out by Sigmund , who instead marries <unk> . Sigmund is killed in battle , and the pregnant <unk> is taken to live in the hall of King Elf in Denmark .

 There she gives birth to Sigurd . Sigurd is raised by Regin , a cunning old man , and when he grows to manhood he asks for a horse from King Elf . Elf bids him choose the one he likes best , and Sigurd takes the best horse , and names it Grani . Sigurd is now urged by Regin to attack Fafnir , a dragon who guards a hoard of gold . This treasure is a curse to all who possess it . Fafnir , Regin says , was originally a human being ; indeed , the dragon was Regin 's brother and thus the gold rightfully belongs to Regin . He tries and fails to forge an adequate sword for Sigurd , but Sigurd produces the shattered fragments of Odin 's sword , which he has inherited from Sigmund , and from these fragments Regin forges a mighty sword , named " the Wrath " by Sigurd . Sigurd makes his way to Fafnir 's lair , kills him , drinks his blood , and roasts and eats his heart . This gives him the power to understand the voices of birds and to read the hearts of men . He now understands that Regin intends to kill him , and so he kills Regin and takes Fafnir 's treasure for himself . On his journey homeward Sigurd comes across an unearthly blaze on the slopes of <unk> . He rides straight into it and comes unharmed to the heart of the fire , where he finds a beautiful sleeping woman clad in armour . He wakes her , and she tells him that she is Brynhild , a handmaiden of Odin whom he has left here as a punishment for disobedience . They pledge themselves to each other , Sigurd places a ring from Fafnir 's hoard on her finger , and he leaves .

 The scene changes to the court of <unk> , the Niblung king . <unk> 's daughter Gudrun has a dream in which she encounters a beautiful but ominous falcon and takes it to her breast . Anxious to learn the meaning of the dream she rides to visit Brynhild , who tells her that she will marry a king , but that her life will be darkened by war and death . Gudrun returns home . Sigurd revisits Brynhild and they again declare their love for each other . He then rides to the Niblung court , where he joins them in making war on the Southland , winning great glory for himself . The witch <unk> , Gudrun 's mother , gives Sigurd a potion that makes him fall in love with Gudrun . Completely under her spell , he marries her and sets out to win Brynhild for Gudrun 's brother Gunnar . Visiting Brynhild again , this time magically disguised as Gunnar , and again penetrating the fire that surrounds her , he reminds her that she is promised to whoever can overcome the supernatural fire , and so deceives her into reluctantly vowing to marry Gunnar . Brynhild goes to the Niblung land and carries out her promise . She is distraught at this tragic outcome , and doubly so when Gudrun spitefully tells her of the trick by which Sigurd deceived her into an unwanted wedding . Brynhild now urges Gunnar and his brothers <unk> and Guttorm to kill Sigurd . Guttorm murders Sigurd as he lies in bed , but the dying Sigurd throws his sword and kills Guttorm as he leaves . Brynhild , filled with remorse , commits suicide so that she and Sigurd can be burned on a single funeral pyre .

Atli invites the surviving Niblung brothers to a feast , and when they arrive he threatens them with death if they do not give him the treasure . Gunnar and <unk> defy him to do his worst , and a battle breaks out in Atli 's hall . The Niblung brothers are overwhelmed by superior force , tied up and killed . Atli holds a victory @-@ feast , at the end of which he and all his court lie sleeping drunkenly in the hall .

 = = Genesis = = 
 Morris first came across the story of the Volsungs , " the grandest tale that ever was told " as he later called it , as a young man , when he read a summary of it in Benjamin Thorpe 's Northern Mythology , which became a favourite book of his . In his The Earthly Paradise ( 1868 – 70 ) he included a versification of the story of Sigurd 's daughter <unk> , which he may have taken from Thorpe . In 1868 he began to learn Old Norse from the Icelandic scholar Eiríkr Magnússon , and embarked with him on a series of collaborative translations from the Icelandic classics . In 1870 they published Völsunga Saga : The Story of the Volsungs and Niblungs , with Certain Songs from the Elder Edda , claiming uncompromisingly in the preface that " This is the Great Story of the North , which should be to all our race what the Tale of Troy was to the Greeks " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 While still working on the prose translation Morris wrote to Charles Eliot Norton : 
 I had it in my head to write an epic of it , but though I still hanker after it , I see clearly it would be foolish , for no verse could render the best parts of it , and it would only be a flatter and tamer version of a thing already existing . 
 Morris visited Iceland in 1871 and 1873 . Also in 1873 he was aware that Richard Wagner was writing Der Ring des Nibelungen , and wrote : 
 I look upon it as nothing short of desecration to bring such a tremendous and world @-@ wide subject under the gaslights of an opera : the most rococo and degraded of all forms of art – the idea of a sandy @-@ haired German tenor <unk> over the unspeakable woes of Sigurd , which even the simplest words are not typical enough to express ! 
 Morris began work on Sigurd the Volsung in October 1875 , completing it the following year . In the end the poem extended to over 10 @,@ 000 lines . He took both the Volsunga Saga and the corresponding poems of the Poetic Edda | Elder Edda as his basic sources , but felt free to alter them as he thought necessary . The poem is in rhyming hexameter couplets , often with <unk> movement and a feminine caesura . In keeping with the Germanic theme Morris used kennings , a good deal of alliteration , and wherever possible words of Anglo @-@ Saxon origin . This resulted in a difficult and archaic diction , involving such lines as : 
 The folk of the war @-@ wand 's forgers wrought never better steel 
 Since first the burg of heaven <unk> for man @-@ folk 's weal . 
 and 
 So they make the yoke @-@ beasts ready , and <unk> the <unk> for the way . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 According to Morris ' daughter May it was the work he " held most highly and wished to be remembered by " . Contemporary reviewers mostly agreed . In America The Atlantic Monthly compared it to Tennyson 's Idylls of the King , writing that 
 Sigurd , the Volsung is the second great English epic of our generation ... and it ranks after Tennyson 's " <unk> " in order of time only . It fully equals that monumental work in the force and pathos of the story told , while it surpasses it in unity and continuity of interest . 
 Edmund Gosse , in The Academy , enthused : " The style he has adopted is more exalted and less idyllic , more rapturous and less luxurious – in a word , more spirited and more virile than that of any of his earlier works . " The Literary World agreed that it was " the manliest and the loveliest work of Mr. Morris 's genius " , going on to predict that " Whatever its immediate reception may be , William Morris 's Sigurd is certain eventually to take its place among the few great epics of the English tongue . " The note of caution as to the reaction of the 19th century reading public was sounded more strongly by several other critics . Theodore Watts wrote in The Athenaeum , " That this is a noble poem there can be no doubt ; but whether it will meet with ready appreciation and sympathy in this country is a question not so easily disposed of . " He thought it " Mr. Morris 's greatest achievement " , but worried about the choice of metre , which he thought monotonous in effect . In an unfavourable review for Fraser 's Magazine , Henry Hewlett complained that " The narrative seldom rises above mediocrity ... the memory finds little to carry away , and the ear still less to haunt it . " He was particularly repulsed by the Dark Age outlook he believed Morris to have adopted : 
 A poem ... which , like Sigurd , reflects , with hard , uncompromising realism , an obsolete code of ethics , and a barbarous condition of society , finds itself <unk> at discord with the key of nineteenth @-@ century feeling . Deprived of its strongest claim to interest , a sympathetic response in the moral and religious sentiment of its readers , it can only appeal to the intellect as a work of art , or as a more or less successful attempt at antiquarian restoration . It may be admired and applauded by the lettered few ; but it will not be taken to the nation 's heart . 
 By contrast , the North American Review believed it to be Morris 's method " To reproduce the antique , not as the ancients felt it , but as we feel it , – to <unk> it with modern thought and emotion . " 
 After Morris 's death interest in his poems began to fade , but a few enthusiasts for Sigurd the Volsung continued to speak out in its favour . Arthur Symons wrote in 1896 that Sigurd the Volsung " remains his masterpiece of sustained power " , and in 1912 the young T. E. Lawrence called it " the best poem I know " According to the philologist E. V. Gordon Sigurd the Volsung is " incomparably the greatest poem – perhaps the only great poem – in English which has been inspired by Norse literature " , and George Bernard Shaw went so far as to call it " the greatest epic since Homer " . However the novelist Eric Linklater , while acknowledging that " Morris tells his story with endless invention , with a brilliant profusion of detail " , complained that the poem 's " Thames @-@ side heroism " conveyed too facile a sense of tragedy . It has never had a wide readership , and contemporary judgements on Sigurd tend to depend upon the judge 's opinion of Morris 's verse in general . Some find its length and archaic diction off @-@ putting , but many modern critics agree with Morris that it is his finest poem . 
 = = Editions = = 
 The poem was published by Ellis and White in November 1876 , although the date appeared on the imprint as 1877 . They issued a second edition in 1877 and a third in 1880 . The book was brought out again in 1887 by Reeves and Turner , and in 1896 by Longman . In 1898 , two years after Morris 's death , a revised text was published by the Kelmscott Press in an edition limited to 160 paper copies and 6 vellum copies , with wood cuts by Sir Edward Burne @-@ Jones . In 1910 Longman issued an edition in which some passages were replaced with prose summaries by Winifred Turner and Helen Scott . In 1911 the same firm reprinted the original version as volume 12 of The Collected Works of William Morris , with an introduction by May Morris ; in the absence of a critical edition this is the one generally cited by scholars . In recent years Sigurd the Volsung has been frequently reprinted , sometimes in the Turner and Scott abridged version . 
 = = Influence on later fantasy writers = = 
 Magnússon and Morris remained the only English translation of Volsunga saga until Margaret <unk> 's version in 1930 . As such it influenced such writers as Andrew Lang , who adapted it in his Red Fairy Book , and J. R. R. Tolkien , who read it in his student days . In a letter , Tolkien mentions that he wished to imitate Morris 's romances , and indeed among his works is a version of the Sigurd story , The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun ( published posthumously in 2009 ) . Stefan Arvidsson compares Morris 's Sigurd and Tolkien 's Legend : 
 In contrast to Morris ’ work , written as it is in heavily archaic , difficult @-@ to @-@ penetrate prose , Tolkien 's recently @-@ published draft was closer in both style and content to the heroic sagas of The Poetic Edda . 
 Other authors have been inspired more or less directly by the Volsung cycle , following Morris ' lead . For example , Kevin Crossley @-@ Holland published his own translation of the myths , Axe @-@ age , Wolf @-@ age .

William Morris ' words were deemed fitting to express this idea . 
 = Blacktip shark = 
 Not to be confused with the blacktip reef shark , Carcharhinus melanopterus . 
 The blacktip shark ( Carcharhinus limbatus ) is a species of requiem shark , and part of the family Carcharhinidae . It is common to coastal tropical and subtropical waters around the world , including brackish habitats . Genetic analyses have revealed substantial variation within this species , with populations from the western Atlantic Ocean isolated and distinct from those in the rest of its range . The blacktip shark has a stout , fusiform body with a pointed snout , long gill slits , and no ridge between the dorsal fins . Most individuals have black tips or edges on the pectoral , dorsal , pelvic , and caudal fins . It usually attains a length of 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) . 
 Swift , energetic piscivores , blacktip sharks are known to make spinning leaps out of the water while attacking schools of small fish . Their demeanor has been described as " timid " compared to other large requiem sharks . Both juveniles and adults form groups of varying size . Like other members of its family , the blacktip shark is viviparous ; females bear one to 10 pups every other year . Young blacktip sharks spend the first months of their lives in shallow nurseries , and grown females return to the nurseries where they were born to give birth themselves . In the absence of males , females are also capable of asexual reproduction . 
 Normally wary of humans , blacktip sharks can become aggressive in the presence of food and have been responsible for a number of attacks on people . This species is of importance to both commercial and recreational fisheries across many parts of its range , with its meat , skin , fins , and liver oil used . It has been assessed as Near Threatened by the IUCN , on the basis of its low reproductive rate and high value to fishers . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The blacktip shark was first described by French zoologist Achille Valenciennes as Carcharias ( Prionodon ) limbatus in Johannes Müller and Friedrich Henle 's 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen . The type specimens were two individuals caught off Martinique , both of which have since been lost . Later authors moved this species to the genus Carcharhinus . The specific epithet limbatus is Latin for " bordered " , referring to the black edges of this shark 's fins . Other common names used for the blacktip shark include <unk> shark , blacktip whaler , common or small blacktip shark , grey shark , and <unk> ground shark . 
 = = Phylogeny and evolution = = 
 The closest relatives of the blacktip shark were originally thought to be the graceful shark ( C. amblyrhynchoides ) and the spinner shark ( C. brevipinna ) , due to similarities in morphology and behavior . However , this interpretation has not been borne out by studies of mitochondrial and ribosomal DNA , which instead suggest affinity with the blacknose shark ( C. acronotus ) . More work is required to fully resolve the relationship between the blacktip shark and other Carcharhinus species . 
 Analysis of mitochondrial DNA has also revealed two distinct lineages within this species , one occupying the western Atlantic and the other occupying the eastern Atlantic , Indian , and Pacific Oceans . This suggests that Indo @-@ Pacific blacktip sharks are descended from those in the eastern Atlantic , while the western Atlantic sharks became isolated by the widening Atlantic Ocean on one side and the formation of the Isthmus of Panama on the other . Blacktip sharks from these two regions differ in morphology , coloration , and life history characteristics , and the eastern Atlantic lineage may merit species status . Fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in Early Miocene ( 23 – 16 Ma ) deposits in Delaware and Florida . 
 = = Description = = 
 The blacktip shark has a robust , streamlined body with a long , pointed snout and relatively small eyes . The five pairs of gill slits are longer than those of similar requiem shark species . The jaws contain 15 tooth rows on either side , with two symphysial teeth ( at the jaw midline ) in the upper jaw and one symphysial tooth in the lower jaw . The teeth are broad @-@ based with a high , narrow cusp and serrated edges . The first dorsal fin is tall and falcate ( sickle @-@ shaped ) with a short free rear tip ; no ridge runs between the first and second dorsal fins . The large pectoral fins are falcate and pointed . 
 The coloration is gray to brown above and white below , with a conspicuous white stripe running along the sides . The pectoral fins , second dorsal fin , and the lower lobe of the caudal fin usually have black tips . The pelvic fins and rarely the anal fin may also be black @-@ tipped . The first dorsal fin and the upper lobe of the caudal fin typically have black edges . Some larger individuals have unmarked or nearly unmarked fins . Blacktip sharks can temporarily lose almost all their colors during blooms , or " whitings " , of <unk> . This species attains a maximum known length of 2 @.@ 8 m ( 9 @.@ 2 ft ) , though 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) is more typical , and a maximum known weight of 123 kg ( 271 lb ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The blacktip shark has a worldwide distribution in tropical and subtropical waters . In the Atlantic , it is found from Massachusetts to Brazil , including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea , and from the Mediterranean Sea , Madeira , and the Canary Islands to the Democratic Republic of the Congo . It occurs all around the periphery of the Indian Ocean , from South Africa and Madagascar to the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent , to Southeast Asia . In the western Pacific , it is found from southern China to northern Australia , including the Philippines and Indonesia . In the eastern Pacific , it occurs from Baja California to Peru . It has also been reported at a number of Pacific islands , including New Caledonia , Tahiti , the Marquesas , Hawaii , Revillagigedo , and the Galápagos . 
 Most blacktip sharks are found in water less than 30 m ( 98 ft ) deep over continental and insular shelves , though they may dive to 64 m ( 210 ft ) . Favored habitats are muddy bays , island lagoons , and the drop @-@ offs near coral reefs ; they are also tolerant of low salinity and enter estuaries and mangrove swamps . Although an individual may be found some distance offshore , blacktip sharks do not inhabit oceanic waters . Seasonal migration has been documented for the population off the east coast of the United States , moving north to North Carolina in the summer and south to Florida in the winter . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The blacktip shark is an extremely fast , energetic predator that is usually found in groups of varying size . Segregation by sex and age does not occur ; adult males and nonpregnant females are found apart from pregnant females , and both are separated from juveniles . In Terra <unk> Bay , Florida , a nursery area for this species , juvenile <unk> form aggregations during the day and disperse at night . They aggregate most strongly in the early summer when the sharks are youngest , suggesting that they are seeking refuge from predators ( mostly larger sharks ) in numbers . Predator avoidance may also be the reason why juvenile <unk> do not congregate in the areas of highest prey density in the bay . Adults have no known predators . Known parasites of the blacktip shark include the copepods Pandarus sinuatus and P. smithii , and the monogeneans Dermophthirius <unk> and <unk> spp . , which attach the shark 's skin . This species is also parasitized by nematodes in the family <unk> , which infest the ovaries . 
 = = = Behavior = = = 
 Like the spinner shark , the blacktip shark is known to leap out of the water and spin three or four times about its axis before landing . Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs , in which the shark corkscrews vertically through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air . Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump out of the water to dislodge attached <unk> ( Echeneis naucrates ) , which irritate the shark 's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape . The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6 @.@ 3 m / s ( 21 ft / s ) . 
 Blacktip sharks have a timid disposition and consistently lose out to Galapagos sharks ( C. galapagensis ) and silvertip sharks ( C. albimarginatus ) of equal size when competing for food . If threatened or challenged , they may perform an agonistic display : the shark swims towards the threat and then turns away , while rolling from side to side , lowering its pectoral fins , tilting its head and tail upwards , and making sideways biting motions . The entire sequence lasts around 25 seconds . This behavior is similar to the actions of a shark attempting to move a sharksucker ; one of these behaviors possibly is derived from the other . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Fish make up some 90 % of the blacktip shark 's diet . A wide variety of fish have been recorded as prey for this species : sardines , herring , anchovies , ladyfish , sea catfish , <unk> , flatfish , threadfins , mullet , mackerel , jacks , groupers , snook , porgies , mojarras , emperors , grunts , butterfish , tilapia , triggerfish , <unk> , and porcupinefish . They also feed on rays and skates , as well as smaller sharks such as smoothhounds and sharpnose sharks . Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken . In the Gulf of Mexico , the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden ( Brevoortia patronus ) , followed by the Atlantic croaker ( <unk> <unk> ) . Off South Africa , jacks and herring are the most important prey . Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk . The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available , such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 As with other requiem sharks , the blacktip shark exhibits vivipary . Females typically give birth to four to seven ( range one to 10 ) pups every other year , making use of shallow coastal nurseries that offer plentiful food and fewer predators . Known nurseries include Pine Island Sound , Terra <unk> Bay , and Yankeetown along the Gulf Coast of Florida , Bulls Bay on the coast of South Carolina , and <unk> do Paraná on the coast of Brazil . Although adult blacktip sharks are highly mobile and disperse over long distances , they are philopatric and return to their original nursery areas to give birth . This results in a series of genetically distinct breeding stocks that overlap in geographic range . 
 Mating occurs from spring to early summer , and the young are born around the same time the following year after a gestation period of 10 – 12 months . Females have one functional ovary and two functional uteri ; each uterus is separated into compartments with a single embryo inside each . The embryos are initially sustained by a yolk sac ; in the 10th or 11th week of gestation , when the embryo measures 18 – 19 cm long ( 7 @.@ 1 – 7 @.@ 5 in ) , the supply of yolk is exhausted and the yolk sac develops into a placental connection that sustains the embryo until birth . The length at birth is 55 – 60 cm ( 22 – 24 in ) off the eastern United States and 61 – 65 cm ( 24 – 26 in ) off North Africa . The mortality rate in the first 15 months of life is 61 – 91 % , with major threats being predation and starvation . The young remain in the nurseries until their first fall , when they migrate to their wintering grounds . 
 The growth rate of this species slows with age : 25 – 30 cm ( 9 @.@ 8 – 11 @.@ 8 in ) in the first six months , then 20 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) a year until the second year , then 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) a year until maturation , then 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) a year for adults . The size at maturity varies geographically : males and females mature at 1 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 6 – 4 @.@ 9 ft ) and 1 @.@ 6 m ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) , respectively , in the northeastern Atlantic , 1 @.@ 3 – 1 @.@ 4 m ( 4 @.@ 3 – 4 @.@ 6 ft ) and 1 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 6 m ( 4 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 2 ft ) , respectively , in the Gulf of Mexico , 1 @.@ 5 and 1 @.@ 6 m ( 4 @.@ 9 and 5 @.@ 2 ft ) respectively off South Africa , and 1 @.@ 7 and 1 @.@ 8 m ( 5 @.@ 6 and 5 @.@ 9 ft ) , respectively , off North Africa . The age at maturation is 4 – 5 years for males and 7 – 8 years for females . The lifespan is at least 12 years . 
 In 2007 , a 9 @-@ year @-@ old female blacktip shark at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center was found to be pregnant with a single near @-@ term female pup , despite having never mated with a male . Genetic analysis confirmed that her offspring was the product of <unk> parthenogenesis , a form of asexual reproduction in which an ovum merges with a polar body to form a zygote without fertilization . Along with an earlier case of parthenogenesis in the bonnethead ( Sphyrna tiburo ) , this event suggests that asexual reproduction may be more widespread in sharks than previously thought .

 Blacktip sharks showing curiosity towards divers has been reported , but they remain at a safe distance . Under most circumstances , these timid sharks are not regarded as highly dangerous to humans . However , they may become aggressive in the presence of food , and their size and speed invite respect . As of 2008 , the International Shark Attack File lists 28 unprovoked attacks ( one fatal ) and 13 provoked attacks by this species . Blacktip sharks are responsible annually for 16 % of the shark attacks around Florida . Most attacks by this species result in only minor wounds . 
 As one of the most common large sharks in coastal waters , the blacktip shark is caught in large numbers by commercial fisheries throughout the world , using longlines , fixed @-@ bottom nets , bottom trawls , and hook @-@ and @-@ line . The meat is of high quality and marketed fresh , frozen , or dried and salted . In addition , the fins are used for shark fin soup , the skin for leather , the liver oil for vitamins , and the carcasses for fishmeal . Blacktip sharks are one of the most important species to the northwestern Atlantic shark fishery , second only to the sandbar shark ( C. plumbeus ) . The flesh is considered superior to that of the sandbar shark , resulting in the sandbar and other requiem shark species being sold under the name " blacktip shark " in the United States . The blacktip shark is also very significant to Indian and Mexican fisheries , and is caught in varying numbers by fisheries in the Mediterranean and South China Seas , and off northern Australia . 
 The blacktip shark is popular with recreational anglers in Florida , the Caribbean , and South Africa . It is listed as a game fish by the International Game Fish Association . Once hooked , this species is a strong , steady fighter that sometimes jumps out of the water . Since 1995 , the number of blacktip sharks taken by recreational anglers in the United States has approached or surpassed the number taken by commercial fishing . The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the blacktip shark as Near Threatened , as its low reproductive rate renders it vulnerable to overfishing . The United States and Australia are the only two countries that manage fisheries catching blacktip sharks . In both cases , regulation occurs under umbrella management schemes for multiple shark species , such as that for the large coastal sharks category of the US National Marine Fisheries Service Atlantic shark Fisheries Management Plan . No conservation plans specifically for this species have been implemented .

 Al @-@ Rahba ( / ALA @-@ LC : ar @-@ <unk> , sometimes spelled <unk> ) , also known as Qal 'at ar @-@ Rahba , which translates as the " Citadel of al @-@ Rahba " , is a medieval Arab – Islamic fortress in Syria . It is located off the western banks of the Euphrates River , adjacent to the city of Mayadin and 42 kilometers ( 26 mi ) southeast of Dayr az @-@ Zawr . Situated atop a mound with an elevation of 244 meters ( 801 ft ) , al @-@ Rahba oversees the Syrian Desert steppe and historically guarded the Euphrates valley . It has been described as " a fortress within a fortress " ; it consists of an inner keep measuring 60 by 30 meters ( 197 ft × 98 ft ) , protected by an enclosure measuring 270 by 95 meters ( 886 ft × 312 ft ) . Al @-@ Rahba is largely in ruins today as a result of erosion . 
 The original site , which was known as " Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk " after its Abbasid namesake and founder , was located along the Euphrates . It was viewed by Muslim armies , caravans and travelers as the key to Syria from Iraq and sometimes vice versa . Bedouin tribes often took control of it and used it as a launching point for invasions of northern Syria . Because of its strategic location , al @-@ Rahba was frequently fought over by Muslim powers , including local lords , the Hamdanids , the Uqaylids , the Mirdasids and the Seljuks , among others . Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk was destroyed in an earthquake in 1157 . 
 A few years later , the current fortress was built close to the desert edge by the Zengid – Ayyubid lord Shirkuh . The latter 's descendants held al @-@ Rahba as a hereditary fief granted by Saladin until 1264 . One of them , Shirkuh II , oversaw a third major reconstruction in 1207 . Through the early Mamluk era ( late 13th – 14th centuries ) , the fortress was continuously restored and strengthened as a result of frequent sieges by the Ilkhanid Mongols of Iraq . Al @-@ Rahba was the most important Mamluk fortress along the Euphrates , an administrative center and the terminal stop on the sultanate 's postal route . It fell into disuse during Ottoman rule ( 1517 – 1918 ) and from then until the early 20th century , the fortress primarily served as a shelter for local shepherds and their flocks . Excavations were carried out at the site between 1976 and 1981 . 
 = = Location and etymology = = 
 Throughout Islamic history , al @-@ Rahba was considered , in the words of the 14th @-@ century traveler Ibn Batuta , " the end of Iraq and the beginning of al @-@ Sham [ Syria ] " . The fortress is located about 4 kilometers ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) southwest of the Euphrates River , 1 kilometer ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) southwest of the modern Syrian city of Mayadin , and 42 kilometers ( 26 mi ) southeast of Dayr az @-@ Zawr , capital of the Dayr az @-@ Zawr Governorate , of which al @-@ Rahba is part . According to the 13th @-@ century geographer Yaqut al @-@ Hamawi , the site 's name , al @-@ <unk> , translates from Arabic as the " flat part of a wadi , where the water collects " ; al @-@ Rahba 's original location was on the western bank of the Euphrates . The current fortress is situated on an artificial mound detached from the plateau of the Syrian Desert to its west . Its elevation is 244 meters ( 801 ft ) above sea level .

 = = = = Founding = = = = 
 According to historian Thierry Bianquis , " Hardly anything definite is known about the history of the town [ al @-@ Rahba ] before the Muslim era . " Medieval Talmudic and Syriac writers ( such as Michael the Syrian and Bar Hebraeus ) identified it with the Biblical town of <unk> han @-@ Nahar ( " <unk> by the river [ Euphrates ] " ) . Some medieval Muslim historians , among them al @-@ Tabari , have written that it was a place called " <unk> " or " <unk> Nu 'm " , named after a monastery that supposedly existed in its vicinity called " Dayr Nu 'm " . However , the 9th @-@ century Persian historian al @-@ Baladhuri asserts that there was " no trace that ar @-@ Rahba ... was an old city " , and that it was first founded by the Abbasid general Malik ibn Tawk during the reign of Caliph al @-@ Ma 'mun ( 813 – 833 CE ) . As such , the fortress town was often referred to " Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk " by Muslim historians . According to Syrian historian Suhayl Zakkar , al @-@ Rahba held significant strategic value as it was " the key to Syria and sometimes to Iraq " and it was the first stop for Syria @-@ bound caravans coming from Iraq . From al @-@ Rahba , travelers , caravans and armies could proceed northwestward along the Euphrates route to Aleppo or traverse the desert route to Damascus . Because of its strategic value , it was frequently fought over by rival Muslim powers . Bedouin tribes in particular used al @-@ Rahba as a main launch point for invasions of northern Syria , and as a safe haven and marketplace . Malik ibn Tawk served as its first lord , and after his death in 873 , he was succeeded by his son Ahmad . The latter was expelled following al @-@ Rahba 's capture in 883 by the Abbasid lord of al @-@ Anbar , Muhammad ibn Abi 'l @-@ Saj . By the 10th century , al @-@ Rahba had become a large town . 
 In 903 , the Qarmatian leader al @-@ Husayn ibn Zikrawayh was imprisoned in al @-@ Rahba before being transferred to Caliph al @-@ Mustakfi 's custody in al @-@ Raqqa . At the time , al @-@ Rahba was the center of the Euphrates province and headquarters of its governor , Ibn Sima . Al @-@ Husayn was executed , prompting his partisans from the Banu <unk> tribe to submit to Ibn Sima in al @-@ Rahba in early 904 . However , shortly after , they turned against Ibn Sima , whose forces routed them in an ambush in al @-@ Rahba 's environs in August . Following further battles , Ibn Sima received another round of surrenders by Qarmatian chieftains and da 'is ( Ismaili religious leaders ) . In March 928 , the Qarmatians under Abu Tahir al @-@ Jannabi conquered al @-@ Rahba and massacred scores of its inhabitants . Its residents faced hardships for several more years due to civil strife in the surrounding region . Peace was established in 942 with the arrival of a certain Abbasid commander named Adl who was dispatched by <unk> , the strongman of the Baghdad @-@ based caliphate . Adl subsequently became governor of the Euphrates and Khabur valley regions . 
 = = = = Hamdanid period = = = = 
 Al @-@ Rahba came under Hamdanid rule a few years later , becoming part of the Euphrates district ( <unk> al @-@ Furat ) of the Mosul @-@ based emirate . At the time , the town was described by the Persian geographer al @-@ Istakhri , as being larger than the ancient Circesium on the opposite side of the Euphrates . The lord of al @-@ Rahba , Jaman , rebelled against the Hamdanid emir of Mosul , Nasir al @-@ Dawla ( r . 929 – 967 ) . Jaman fled the town and drowned in the Euphrates but not before al @-@ Rahba was heavily damaged in the rebellion 's suppression . Nasir al @-@ Dawla granted his favored son , Abu 'l <unk> Hamdan , control of al @-@ Rahba , its district of Diyar Mudar , and the district 's revenues . 
 Nasir al @-@ Dawla 's sons contested control of al @-@ Rahba in the aftermath of their father 's deposition in 969 . It ultimately passed to his son Abu Taghlib when his brother and subordinate commander , Hibat @-@ Allah , captured it from Hamdan in a surprise attack . Abu Taghlib had al @-@ Rahba 's walls rebuilt . He restored al @-@ Rahba to Hamdan to preempt the possibility of his Buyid enemy , Izz al @-@ Dawla al @-@ Bakhtiyar , forming an alliance with Hamdan to undermine Abu Taghlib . The Hamdanids lost control of al @-@ Rahba in 978 , after which it was captured by the Buyid emir ' Adud al @-@ Dawla ( r . 949 – 983 ) . In 991 , al @-@ Rahba 's inhabitants requested and received a governor assigned by ' Adud 's son , Emir Baha ' al @-@ Dawla ( r . 988 – 1012 ) . The town was described by Jerusalemite geographer al @-@ Muqaddasi in the late 10th century as being the center of the Euphrates district , located on the edge of the desert , having a semi @-@ circular layout and being defended by a strong fortress . He also noted that the wider vicinity was characterized by highly irrigated and productive lands , with abundant date palms and quince groves . 
 = = = = Uqaylid and Mirdasid period = = = = 
 In the early 11th century , control of al @-@ Rahba was contested between the Uqaylids of Mosul and the Fatimids of Egypt . Preceding this conflict , the Fatimid caliph al @-@ Hakim appointed a member of the Al <unk> tribe , Abu Ali ibn Thimal , as lord of al @-@ Rahba . Abu Ali was killed in 1008 / 09 during a battle with his Uqaylid rivals led by Isa ibn <unk> . The latter lost al @-@ Rahba to another Uqaylid emir , Badran ibn <unk> . The latter 's victory was short @-@ lived as the Fatimid emir of Damascus , Lu 'lu , soon captured both al @-@ Rahba and al @-@ Raqqah , a fortified city to the northwest . He appointed a governor for al @-@ Rahba and returned to Damascus . 
 A wealthy resident of al @-@ Rahba , Ibn Mahkan , revolted against the Fatimids and took control of the town shortly after Lu 'lu departed . Though able to oust the Fatimid governor , Ibn Mahkan was unable to hold the town without outside support since al @-@ Rahba was located amid the crossroads of several regional powers who coveted the town . Thus , he gained the backing of the Mirdasid emir of the Banu Kilab tribe , Salih ibn <unk> . Conflict arose between Ibn Mahkan and Salih leading the latter to besiege al @-@ Rahba . The two reconciled and then Ibn Mahkan and his men captured the fortified town of Anah in Anbar . However , when Ibn Mahkan sought Salih 's support in suppressing a revolt in Anah , the latter used the opportunity to kill Ibn Mahkan . 
 After eliminating Ibn Mahkan , Salih became the lord of al @-@ Rahba , and made his allegiance with the Fatimids . Al @-@ Rahba was the first major territory Salih held and was the touchstone of the emirate he would establish in Aleppo and much of northern Syria . His son Thimal later succeeded him as emir of Aleppo , and al @-@ Rahba became his principal power base from which many of his <unk> ( advisers or ministers ) originated . He was later compelled by the Fatimids to hand over al @-@ Rahba to their ally Arslan al @-@ Basasiri , a Turkish general who revolted against his Seljuk masters and the Abbasid Caliphate . The ceding of al @-@ Rahba to al @-@ Basasiri was the first step in Thimal 's loss of the Mirdasid emirate . Together with the loss of al @-@ Raqqah , it provoked dissension within the Banu Kilab , with Thimal 's brother Atiyya resolving to restore the Mirdasid emirate . Al @-@ Basasiri 's revolt ultimately failed and he was killed in 1059 , prompting Atiyya to capture al @-@ Rahba in April 1060 . Later , in August 1061 , Atiyya successfully defended al @-@ Rahba from <unk> advances . 
 The Mirdasids lost al @-@ Rahba in 1067 to the Uqaylid emir , Sharaf ad @-@ Dawla , a vassal of the Abbasid @-@ affiliated Seljuks . Beforehand , Atiyya and part of his army had been in Homs , allowing Sharaf ad @-@ Dawla the opportunity to rout al @-@ Rahba 's Banu Kilab defenders . Afterward , the name of the Abbasid caliph was read in the town 's khutba ( Friday prayer sermons ) instead of the Fatimids , a formal recognition of al @-@ Rahba 's change of allegiance . In 1086 , the Seljuk sultan Malik @-@ Shah granted al @-@ Rahba and its Upper Mesopotamian dependencies , Harran , al @-@ Raqqa , Saruj and Khabur , to Sharaf ad @-@ Dawla 's son , Muhammad . 
 = = = = Seljuk period = = = = 
 At some point the Seljuks or their Arab allies lost al @-@ Rahba , but in 1093 the Seljuk ruler of Damascus , Tutush captured it along with several other Upper Mesopotamian towns . Following his death , possession of al @-@ Rahba reverted to the Uqaylids , but in 1096 , <unk> of al @-@ <unk> captured and looted the town . He held onto it until 1102 when Qaymaz , a former mamluk ( slave soldier ) of the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan , took control of it . Tutush 's son <unk> and the latter 's deputy <unk> besieged the town , but failed to capture it . Qaymaz died in December 1102 and al @-@ Rahba passed to one of his Turkish mamluks named Hasan , who dismissed many of Qaymaz 's officers and arrested several of al @-@ Rahba 's notables due to suspicions of a coup against him . Duqaq renewed the siege , but this time was welcomed in by al @-@ Rahba 's townspeople , forcing Hasan to retreat into the citadel . Hasan surrendered after receiving guarantees of safe passage from Duqaq as well as an iqta ( fief ) elsewhere in Syria . According to the 12th @-@ century chronicler Ibn al @-@ Athir , al @-@ Rahba 's inhabitants were treated well by Duqaq , who reorganized the administration of the town , established a garrison there , and assigned to it a governor from the Banu Shayban tribe , Muhammad ibn Sabbak . 
 Jawali , a general of the Seljuk sultan Muhammad I , conquered al @-@ Rahba from Ibn Sabbak in May 1107 , after a month @-@ long siege . Ibn al @-@ Athir recorded that al @-@ Rahba 's inhabitants suffered greatly during the siege and that some townsmen informed Jawali of a weak point in the fortress 's defense in return for promises of safety . When Jawali entered the town and sacked it , Ibn Sabbak surrendered and joined Jawali 's service . 
 In 1127 , the Seljuk lord of Mosul , Izz ad @-@ Din Mas 'ud ibn al @-@ <unk> besieged and conquered al @-@ Rahba as part of an attempted invasion of Syria . However , he fell ill and died there shortly after . His lordship in Mosul was taken by Imad ad @-@ Din Zengi , while al @-@ Rahba was left under the control of al @-@ <unk> 's mamluk , al @-@ Jawali , who ruled it as a subordinate of Zengi . Zengi 's son Qutb ad @-@ Din captured al @-@ Rahba some years later . In 1149 , Qutb ad @-@ Din 's brother Nur ad @-@ Din received al @-@ Rahba in Seljuk @-@ sponsored negotiations between the Zengid lords .

 Al @-@ Rahba was destroyed in an earthquake in 1157 . Four years later , Nur ad @-@ Din granted the territories of al @-@ Rahba and Homs as a fief to Shirkuh , who had a certain Yusuf ibn <unk> administer it on his behalf . According to the 14th @-@ century Ayyubid historian , Abu 'l Fida , Shirkuh rebuilt al @-@ Rahba . Abu 'l Fida 's assertion may have been incorrect or the fortress built by Shirkuh fell into a ruinous state at some point before the century 's end . In any case , the new fortress , which became known as " al @-@ Rahba al @-@ Jadida " , was relocated about five kilometers west of the Euphrates ' western bank where the original site , " Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk " , had been situated . When Shirkuh died , his territories reverted to Nur ad @-@ Din . However , Shirkuh 's nephew and the founder of the Ayyubid Sultanate , Saladin , conquered much of Muslim Syria from the Zengids ( the Syrian coast had been in Crusader hands since the early 12th century ) by 1182 and granted Homs and al @-@ Rahba to Shirkuh 's son , Nasir ad @-@ Din Muhammad , as a hereditary emirate . 
 According to the Ayyubid @-@ era chronicler and one @-@ time resident of al @-@ Rahba , Ibn <unk> , the fortress of al @-@ Rahba again rebuilt by Shirkuh 's grandson , al @-@ Mujahid Shirkuh II ( r . 1186 – 1240 ) , in 1207 . Al @-@ Rahba was the easternmost fortress of Shirkuh II 's Homs @-@ based emirate , and was one of the four principal centers of the emirate , the other three being Homs itself , <unk> and Palmyra . He personally oversaw the demolition of al @-@ Rahba 's ruins and the construction of the new fortress . Al @-@ Rahba remained in the hands of Shirkuh 's descendants until a few years after the annexation of Ayyubid Syria by the Mamluk Sultanate in 1260 . 
 = = = = Mamluk period = = = = 
 In 1264 , the Mamluk sultan Baybars ( r . 1260 – 1277 ) replaced the Ayyubid governor of al @-@ Rahba with one of his mamluk officers from Egypt . Al @-@ Rahba 's garrison and its commander held a high place in the Mamluk military hierarchy . The fortress , along with and al @-@ <unk> to the north , emerged as the principal Mamluk bulwark against Mongol invasions of Syria 's eastern frontier . It was the Mamluks ' most important fortress along the Euphrates , supplanting al @-@ Raqqa , which had been the traditional Muslim center in the Euphrates valley since the 10th century . A large population of refugees from areas ruled by the Mongols settled in al @-@ Rahba as did many people from the adjacent , unfortified town of Mashhad al @-@ Rahba ( former site of Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk , modern @-@ day Mayadin ) . It was also the terminal stop of the Mamluk barid ( postal route ) and an administrative center . 
 Throughout the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods , al @-@ Rahba was situated near the tribal territory of the Al Fadl . About four hundred Al Fadl tribesmen joined the small army of Caliph al @-@ Mustansir , the Egypt @-@ based Abbasid caliph dispatched by Baybars to recapture Baghdad from the Mongols , when he reached al @-@ Rahba . The latter was al @-@ Mustansir 's first stop after he rode out from Damascus , but his campaign ultimately failed and he was killed in a Mongol ambush in al @-@ Anbar . The Mongols of Ilkhanid Iraq inflicted significant damage on al @-@ Rahba during their wars with the Mamluks . The fortress was restored by Baybars at some point toward the end of his reign . In 1279 , the Mamluk viceroy of Syria , Sunqur al @-@ Ashqar , rebelled against Sultan Qalawun ( r . 1279 – 1290 ) and took refuge with the Al Fadl chieftain , Isa ibn Muhanna , at al @-@ Rahba , where he requested the intervention of the Mongol ruler Abaqa Khan . When the Mongols could not help him , Sunqur fled the incoming Mamluk army , while Isa barricaded himself in the fortress . The Mongols ' failure to capture al @-@ Rahba after a month @-@ long siege commanded by the Ilkhanid ruler Öljaitü in 1312 / 13 marked the Ilkhanate 's final attempt to invade Mamluk Syria . Isa 's son Muhanna rebelled against Sultan an @-@ Nasir Muhammad ( r . 1310 – 1341 ) in 1320 , and was pursued by the Mamluk army as far al @-@ Rahba . During the ensuing confrontation , the fortress may have been destroyed . 
 = = = = Ottoman era = = = = 
 Under the Ottomans , who conquered Syria and Iraq in the early 16th century , al @-@ Rahba 's military use apparently diminished . During the Middle Ages , the road between Palmyra and al @-@ Rahba was the most important Syrian desert route , but its importance declined during Ottoman rule . From then on , al @-@ Rahba was mostly used as a shelter for shepherds from nearby villages and their flocks . In 1588 , it was visited by the Venetian traveler Gasparo Balbi , who noted a dilapidated fortress and inhabitants known as " <unk> " living below it . The French traveler , Jean @-@ Baptiste Tavernier , mentioned Mashhad Rahba , 9 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 0 mi ) southwest of the fortress , during his travels there in circa 1632 . In 1797 , French traveler Guillaume @-@ Antoine Olivier passed by al @-@ Rahba , mentioning that it was a fortress and a ruined site . 
 = = Excavations = = 
 The fortress has deteriorated considerably as a result of erosion . Excavations were carried out at al @-@ Rahba , including the presumed site of Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk along the Euphrates bank , between 1976 and 1981 under the auspices of Syria 's General Directorate of Antiquities and Museums , the Institut Français d 'Etudes <unk> de Damas and the University of Lyon II . In later years , surveys of the site and the surrounding desert and Euphrates and Khabur valleys were carried out by multi @-@ disciplinary teams of Syrian , American and European archaeologists . One of the French surveyors , J. L. Paillet , sketched the plans and elevations of the fortress , which are detailed in his 1983 dissertation , Le château de Rahba , étude d 'architecture militaire <unk> <unk> . 
 Excavations at the foot of the fortress between 1976 and 1978 revealed a medieval settlement within a quadrangular enclosure , some of whose walls measured up to 30 meters ( 98 ft ) long and 4 meters ( 13 ft ) high . The walls generally have a thickness of 1 meter ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) . Among the unearthed structures were the probable remains of a khan ( caravanserai ) , a congregational mosque with a small oratory , and a cavalry barracks . There was also a system of canals that brought in fresh water and emptied sewage . Among the artifacts found at the fortress and the former settlement beneath it were pottery sherds and coins ( mostly Mamluk and a few Ayyubid ) and numerous feather <unk> belonging to arrows left over by Mongol besiegers . During the ongoing Syrian Civil War , looting and illegal digging for antiquities have occurred at al @-@ Rahba . Affected areas include the fortress 's storage rooms and courtyards , as well as the medieval settlement at its foot . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 = = = Specifications and components = = = 
 The citadel of al @-@ Rahba is described by historian Janusz <unk> as " a fortress within a fortress " . Its core consists of a four @-@ story , pentagon @-@ shaped keep , roughly measuring 60 by 30 meters ( 197 ft × 98 ft ) . The keep is enclosed by a pentagon @-@ shaped wall , roughly measuring 270 by 95 meters ( 886 ft × 312 ft ) . The outer wall 's shape was described by Paillet as a triangle with its two parallel angles having been chamfered and substituted with short curtain walls . Around the artificial mound upon which the fortress sits is a moat with a depth of 22 meters ( 72 ft ) and a width of 80 meters ( 260 ft ) . Al @-@ Rahba 's moat is considerably deeper than the Ayyubid @-@ era desert fortresses of Palmyra and <unk> . A large cistern makes up the lowest floor of the keep . 
 Several bastions were built along the external walls of the fortress . The western and southeastern sides contained al @-@ Rahba 's four largest bastions , with the largest measuring 17 @.@ 2 by 15 @.@ 2 meters ( 56 ft × 50 ft ) and the smallest being 12 @.@ 4 by 12 @.@ 4 meters ( 41 ft × 41 ft ) . These bastions supported heavy defensive artillery . Their height surpassed the towers of Palmyra and <unk> probably because the latter forts ' locations on isolated hills did not necessitate " state of the art defensive artillery " , according to <unk> . By contrast , at al @-@ Rahba , enemy siege engines could be placed at the close @-@ by plateaus , which were almost at level with the fortress . Al @-@ Rahba 's smallest bastion is on its northern , less vulnerable wall and measures 5 @.@ 2 by 4 @.@ 4 meters ( 17 ft × 14 ft ) . 
 Both the external walls and those around the keep were fitted with merlons and parapets , with the parapets of the keep positioned 6 @.@ 5 meters higher than their counterparts along the external wall . This was done to establish a secondary defensive line that enabled the building 's defenders to shoot arrows at attackers who breached the external walls . The core building was linked to the external fortifications by corridors and chambers . 
 = = = Construction phases = = = 
 Though large parts of the building are in ruins , excavations have determined that al @-@ Rahba went through at least eight undated construction phases probably starting from the early Ayyubid period . For the most part , each phase utilized different architectural techniques and fortification concepts , and none of the phases affected the entire extent of the building at one time . One common theme of the phases was the restoration or strengthening of al @-@ Rahba 's western and southeastern sides , which faced the desert plateau and were the most exposed areas of the fortress . In contrast , the northern side facing the population centers remained largely unchanged . 
 The first phase saw the walls built with mudbrick , a very common feature of Euphrates @-@ area structures . Although the shape of the building after its initial phase cannot be determined , Paillet presumes that its size likely corresponded to that of the current building . The small salient bastion that juts out of the northern wall dates to the first phase . 
 The second phase of construction added three salient bastions , each of which were over twice the size of the northern bastion . The new bastions were placed along the part of al @-@ Rahba 's citadel that faced the desert to the west . The builders in the second phase also reinforced al @-@ Rahba 's walls with roughly cut conglomerate blocks fixed together by high @-@ quality mortar . In the third phase , higher quality mudbrick was used , the western curtain wall was elevated and the southwestern curtain wall was replaced and decorated with bands of Arabic inscriptions . In addition , a large , brick dome was built atop the ground @-@ level chamber of the northwestern bastion . The external walls of the fortress reached their final form during the third phase , though there would be further restorations in later decades . 
 In the fourth phase , low @-@ lying casemates were added to the western and southwestern curtains to provide an additional platform for al @-@ Rahba 's defenders to use . The walls , particularly on the eastern side , were reinforced in the fifth phase , which Paillet attributes to the efforts of Shirkuh II and his Ayyubid contemporaries to strengthen the fortresses of Syria . The building technique used in this phase likely necessitated significant funds , equipment and technical expertise . Several changes were made including the southeastern tower being rebuilt and the northeastern tower being reinforced by an additional wall and a vaulted story . Moreover , the northern slope of the outer wall was further strengthened with a glacis built from large conglomerate blocks . A building in the center of al @-@ Rahba was erected during this phase , likely replacing an older structure or a courtyard . 
 The last major building phase was the sixth , which saw the restoration of the eastern and western external walls after they were severely damaged by Mongol besiegers . A northeastern salient bastion , much smaller than the eastern and western bastions , was also built . Masonry from the fifth phase was reused for the reconstruction along with new gypsum , limestone and other materials . The seventh and eighth phases both consisted of heightening al @-@ Rahba 's western external walls .

 The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of twelve short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle , featuring his fictional detective Sherlock Holmes . It was first published on 14 October 1892 , though the individual stories had been serialised in The Strand Magazine between June 1891 and July 1892 . The stories are not in chronological order , and the only characters common to all twelve are Holmes and Dr. Watson . The stories are related in first @-@ person narrative from Watson 's point of view . 
 In general the stories in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes identify , and try to correct , social injustices . Holmes is portrayed as offering a new , fairer sense of justice . The stories were well received , and boosted the subscriptions figures of The Strand Magazine , prompting Doyle to be able to demand more money for his next set of stories . The first story , " A Scandal in Bohemia " , includes the character of Irene Adler , who , despite being featured only within this one story by Doyle , is a prominent character in modern Sherlock Holmes adaptations , generally as a love interest for Holmes . Doyle included four of the twelve stories from this collection in his twelve favourite Sherlock Holmes stories , picking " The Adventure of the Speckled Band " as his overall favourite . 
 = = Context = = 
 Arthur Conan Doyle began writing while studying medicine at university in the late 1870s , and had his first short story , " The Mystery of <unk> Valley " , published in September 1879 . Eight years later , A Study in Scarlet , Doyle 's first Sherlock Holmes story , was published by Ward Lock & Co . The novel was well received , but Doyle was paid little for it , and despite a sequel novel , The Sign of the Four , also being published by Ward Lock , he shifted his focus to short stories . In early 1891 , the first editor of The Strand Magazine , Herbert <unk> Smith , received two submissions from Doyle for the newly established magazine . He later described his reaction ; " I at once realised that here was the greatest short story writer since Edgar Allan Poe . " The first of these , " A Scandal in Bohemia " was published near the back of The Strand Magazine in July 1891 . The stories proved popular , helping to boost the circulation of the magazine , and Doyle received 30 guineas for each short story in the initial run of twelve . These first twelve stories were published monthly from July 1891 until June 1892 , and then were collected together and published as a book , The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes on 14 October 1892 by George Newnes , the publisher of The Strand Magazine . The initial print run of the book was for 10 @,@ 000 copies in the United Kingdom , and a further 4 @,@ 500 copies in the United States , which were published by Harper Brothers the following day .

 All of the stories within The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes are told in a first @-@ person narrative from the point of view of Dr. Watson , as is the case for all but four of the Sherlock Holmes stories . The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Doyle suggests that the short stories contained in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes tend to point out social injustices , such as " a king 's betrayal of an opera singer , a stepfather 's deception of his ward as a fictitious lover , an aristocratic crook 's exploitation of a failing pawnbroker , a beggar 's extensive estate in Kent . " It suggests that , in contrast , Holmes is portrayed as offering a fresh and fair approach in an unjust world of " official incompetence and aristocratic privilege " . The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes contains many of Doyle 's favourite Sherlock Holmes stories . In 1927 , he submitted a list of what he believed were his twelve best Sherlock Holmes stories to The Strand Magazine . Among those he listed were " The Adventure of the Speckled Band " ( as his favourite ) , " The Red @-@ Headed League " ( second ) , " A Scandal in Bohemia " ( fifth ) and " The Five Orange Pips " ( seventh ) . The book was banned in the Soviet Union in 1929 because of its alleged " occultism " , but the book gained popularity in a black market of similarly banned books , and the restriction was lifted in 1940 .

 The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes were well received upon their serialisation in The Strand Magazine . Following the publication of " A Scandal in Bohemia " in July 1891 , the Hull Daily Mail described the story as being " worthy of the inventive genius " of Doyle . Just over a year later , when Doyle took a break from publishing the short stories upon the completion of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes , a piece in the Belfast News Letter reviewed a story by another author in The Strand Magazine saying that it " might have been read with a moderate amount of interest a year ago " , but that " the unique power " of Doyle 's writing was evident in the gulf in quality between the stories . The Leeds Mercury particularly praised the characterisation of Holmes , " with all his little foibles " , while in contrast the Cheltenham Looker @-@ On described Holmes as " rather a bore sometimes " , noting that descriptions of his foibles " grows wearisome " . The correspondent for Hampshire Telegraph lamented the fact that Doyle 's more thoughtful writing , such as Micah Clarke , was not so popular as the Holmes stories , concluding that an author " who wishes to make literature pay must write what his readers want " . 
 = = Adaptations = = 
 Sherlock Holmes has been adapted numerous times for both films and plays , and the character has been played by over 70 different actors in more than 200 films . A number of film and television series have borne the title " The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes " , but some of these are either original stories , combinations of a number of Doyle 's stories , or in one case , an adaptation of The Sign of the Four . Irene Adler , who is in the first short story , " A Scandal in Bohemia " , is prominent in many modern adaptations , despite only appearing in one story . Often in modern adaptations , she is portrayed as a love interest for Holmes , as in Robert Doherty 's Elementary and the BBC 's Sherlock , even though in the story itself , the narration claims : " It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler . " Many of the stories from the collection were included as episodes in the Granada Television series , Sherlock Holmes which ran from 1984 until 1994 . 
 = Betty ( Adventure Time ) = 
 " Betty " is the forty @-@ eighth episode of the fifth season of the American animated television series Adventure Time . It was written and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan , from a story by Kent Osborne , Pendleton Ward , Jack Pendarvis , Adam Muto , and Moynihan . It originally aired on Cartoon Network on February 24 , 2014 . The episode guest @-@ stars Lena Dunham as the eponymous character , Betty . The entry also saw the return of Miguel Ferrer , Steve Agee , Duncan Trussell , and Maurice LaMarche as various characters . 
 The series follows the adventures of Finn ( voiced by Jeremy Shada ) , a human boy , and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake ( voiced by John DiMaggio ) , a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will . In this episode , the Ice King reverts to Simon ( both voiced by Tom Kenny ) after being exposed to an anti @-@ magic being named Bella Noche , and gets help from Finn , Jake , and Marceline in order to get Betty , his former fiancée , back . Once he succeeds in bringing her back , however , he begins to die , forcing Betty herself to defeat Belle Noche . 
 An episode centered on Betty had been promised by the crew at San Diego Comic @-@ Con International in 2012 . Due to the subject matter and length of the episode , several scenes had to be cut or trimmed for time , since so much was being placed in the episode . A review by Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club was complimentary towards the story , and Sava also applauded Dunham 's voice @-@ acting .

 = = = Background = = = 
 In the context of the series , the Ice King is a recurring antagonist of the series , and frequently kidnaps princesses throughout Ooo ; although he is often at odds with Finn and Jake , he is generally not a serious threat . In the third season episode " Holly Jolly Secrets " , it is revealed that the Ice King was originally a human archaeologist named Simon Petrikov who , after placing a mysterious ice crown on his head , became crazed with magic and scared off the love of his life , Betty , whom he never saw again . In the fourth season episode " I Remember You " , it was revealed that the Ice King and 1000 @-@ year @-@ old Marceline the Vampire Queen had originally met following the events of the mysterious Mushroom War , a cataclysmic war that destroyed modern human society , and " Simon & Marcy " revealed that the two shared a father @-@ daughter bond . 
 = = = Events = = = 
 After Laser Wizard , Bufo , Forest Wizard , and — unwittingly — Ice King help a being named Bella Noche pass over into Wizard City , it reveals itself to be a creature of pure anti @-@ magic . As such , the jewels from Ice King 's crown are stripped of their magic , and Ice King reverts to his former self : Simon Petrikov ( both voiced by Tom Kenny ) . Simon , initially unaware of where he is , steals a magic carpet from Ash ( voiced by Steve Agee ) , flies to the Ice Kingdom , and enters a hidden sanctum wherein elements of his previous life — such as books , artifacts , and his clothing — have been preserved . He phones Marceline , telling her to rush over and bring her stuffed teddy bear Hambo . 
 Marceline arrives with Finn and Jake , and the trio learn that Simon is dying since he is over a thousand years old . As such , he wants to create a portal to the past and apologize to his fiancée Betty for making her leave him . Hambo , filled with sentimentality , is the key to the portal . Marceline , realizing that Hambo will be destroyed but that she will enable her former protector to see the love of his life for one last time , agrees . The portal is opened just moments after Simon had first put on the ice crown and scared Betty . Simon from the future appears to her , explains the situation , and apologizes . Betty , realizing what has happened jumps through the portal and kisses Simon , only for the portal to close and Simon to collapse . 
 Betty instantaneously realizes that Simon needs magic in order to survive , so she places him on the magic carpet and flies it to Wizard City . On the way , Death ( voiced by Miguel Ferrer ) appears to Simon in a vision , offering his one and only chance of escaping the curse of the crown . Simon refuses , and Betty attacks and eventually destroys Bella Noche . Simon reverts to Ice King , unaware of what happened . Later , he recounts the events to a captured Muscle Princess , while Betty — who survived the struggle with Bella Noche — watches sadly from a window and flies off on the magic carpet .

 " Betty " was written and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan , from a story by Kent Osborne , Pendleton Ward , Jack Pendarvis , Adam Muto , and Moynihan . Art direction was handled by Nick Jennings , whereas supervising direction was co @-@ helmed by Nate Cash and Muto . An episode centered on Betty had been promised by the crew at San Diego Comic @-@ Con International in 2012 . Moynihan had originally submitted an idea to the outline writers , who in turn worked with him and rewrote it to produce the final episode . Moynihan later noted that his personal intention for the episode was to " convey the idea that for Simon , death was preferable to life as Ice King , but that love and sacrifice to another person could provide hope for a future . " Huntress Wizard , a character popular with the Adventure Time fanbase , was originally supposed to be featured in the episode . Because " Betty " was already " jam packed " , everything " non @-@ essential " had to be cut out of the storyboard , which left Moynihan " heartbroken " . He later used the " deleted scene " for the episode 's promotional artwork . 
 " Betty " stars comedian and Girls creator Lena Dunham as Betty . Dunham and Adventure Time head writer Kent Osborne were Facebook friends , and knew each other from the independent film scene . When the crew approached her , she was excited and interested because she had a goddaughter who was a fan . She recorded her lines while she was in production for Girls in New York .

 = The Uplift Mofo Party Plan = 
 The Uplift Mofo Party Plan is the third studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers , released on September 29 , 1987 on EMI Records . Due to prior obligations resulting in temporary personnel changes following the band 's formation in 1983 , The Uplift Mofo Party Plan is the only studio album to feature all four founding members of the band on every single track : vocalist Anthony Kiedis , bassist Flea , guitarist Hillel Slovak , and drummer Jack Irons . 
 The record features the band 's signature funk rock musical style , but also is influenced by reggae and heavy metal . For the album , the Red Hot Chili Peppers recruited new producer Michael Beinhorn , who encouraged the members to expand their musical horizons in order to create a more diverse work . The recording process was difficult due to Kiedis ' drug addiction ; however , the band was ultimately content with its work on Uplift . Flea later referred to the album as " the ' <unk> ' record " the band has ever made . 
 The album was more successful than its predecessors both critically and commercially , and was the band 's first album to enter the Billboard 200 , where it charted at number 148 . Although Uplift 's follow @-@ up Mother 's Milk would reach Gold first , The Uplift Mofo Party Plan would go on to become the band 's earliest effort to do so . Following the tour to promote the album , Slovak died of a heroin overdose and shortly after , Irons decided to quit the band , unable to cope with his friend 's death . 
 = = Background = = 
 After Red Hot Chili Peppers signed a record deal with EMI in 1983 , founding members Hillel Slovak and Jack Irons left the group to focus on their group What Is This ? , which had also signed a record deal . Vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea hired Jack Sherman as guitarist and Cliff Martinez as drummer , and established themselves as a prominent funk rock band with their 1984 debut album The Red Hot Chili Peppers . Disappointed with the results of the production , Kiedis and Flea replaced Sherman with Slovak , who had quit his band , What Is This ? , several weeks earlier . The group 's George Clinton @-@ produced second album , Freaky Styley ( 1985 ) , was Slovak 's first studio album with the band . In early 1986 , the band began work on their upcoming album , and EMI gave the Chili Peppers a budget of $ 5 @,@ 000 to record a demo tape . The band chose to work with producer and former Public Image Ltd. guitarist Keith Levene , because he shared the members ' interest in drugs . Levene and Slovak put aside $ 2 @,@ 000 of the budget to spend on drugs without telling the rest of the group , which created tension between the members . Martinez ' " heart was no longer in the band " , but he did not quit , so Kiedis and Flea fired him . After the firing of Martinez , original drummer Jack Irons rejoined the band , which marked the first time all four founding members were together since 1983 . 
 Both Kiedis and Slovak struggled with debilitating heroin addictions , which grew worse as the band was preparing to record Uplift . Due to his addiction , Kiedis lacked the motivation to contribute to the band musically , and appeared at rehearsal " literally asleep " . He was asked to leave the band in order to undergo drug rehabilitation . During that time , the band won the LA Weekly Band of the Year award which prompted Kiedis to quit using heroin cold turkey . He visited his mother in Michigan for guidance , who drove him to drug rehabilitation immediately after picking him up from the airport upon seeing his unhealthy appearance . He checked into Salvation Army rehabilitation clinic in Grand Rapids , an experience which he initially detested until he noted that the other people in the clinic were understanding of his struggles and were trying to help him . He moved in with his mother after twenty days at the clinic , a time which marked the first time he was completely abstinent from drugs since he was eleven years old . After Kiedis completed his stint in rehabilitation , he felt a " whole new wave of enthusiasm " due to his sobriety and wrote the lyrics to a new song entitled " Fight Like a Brave " on the flight home . He rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record the group 's next album . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 While Kiedis was in rehab , the band sought a new producer for their next album . Aspiring producer Michael Beinhorn was looking for work at EMI Records after several unsuccessful projects on other labels , when a man working at EMI approached Beinhorn and suggested that he work with the Red Hot Chili Peppers , as " no one [ knew ] what to do with them " . Beinhorn recalled of the situation : " Though their music all seemed kind of abstract , there was definitely an excitement to it . I thought they needed a lot of arrangement help ... I also quickly learned that [ executives ] at the record label actually hated the Chili Peppers , like openly reviled them so bad that they didn 't even want them to succeed . It was the weirdest thing . " He contacted the band to meet up , and instead of arranging a formal meeting , the band proposed to meet him at a club in New Orleans called Tipitina 's . Beinhorn was impressed by the band 's originality and non @-@ conformist attitude and decided to work with the band . Kiedis then sat down with Beinhorn to discuss the recording of the album ; Kiedis planned to record the album in ten days and write the songs during the recording sessions . 
 The album was recorded in the basement of the Capitol Records Building in Hollywood . Although Kiedis had recently become clean , his withdrawal symptoms increased and affected his musical contributions to the group . After fifty days of sobriety , Kiedis decided to take drugs again as a one @-@ time attempt to celebrate his new music , which led to his resumed addiction . The recording process for the album became difficult as Kiedis would often disappear to seek drugs . Beinhorn recalled that " There were points in pre @-@ production where I really thought the record wasn 't gonna get made . " Kiedis felt " excruciating pain and guilt and shame " when he would miss a recording session so he would try to write lyrics while searching for drugs ; although the band was upset by his drug use and frequent disappearances , they were impressed with his musical output at the time . 
 Although Kiedis ' drug use disrupted the early recording process , the Chili Peppers still had an enjoyable time recording the album . The band was musically inspired by the rejoining of their original drummer Jack Irons , which added " such an important and different element to our chemistry . " Beinhorn encouraged the band to expand their musical horizons on the album , and although the band were initially uncomfortable stepping out of their comfort zone , the members began to feel that Beinhorn was helping them produce their best work . Slovak helped Kiedis record his vocals on the album . In between takes , Slovak would run around the studio out of excitement and say " This is the most beautiful thing we 've ever done . " Slovak reflected on his deep connection to the album in his diary ; " It was so fun . I 'm so extremely proud of everybody 's work — it is at times genius . " During a jam session , the guitarist created a melodic riff which differed greatly in style from the band 's previous work . While Slovak nearly abandoned the riff out of fear that it was too much of a departure stylistically , Beinhorn saw potential in the new melody @-@ based style and encouraged Slovak to turn the short tune into a full song . While the band was skeptical at first , each member began writing their own musical parts and the song became one of the album 's three singles , " Behind the Sun " .

 = = = Music = = = 
 In the book Give It Away : The Stories Behind Every Song , author Rob Fitzpatrick writes " As far as sheer power goes , The Uplift Mofo Party Plan is the Chili Peppers at their most virile , most chest @-@ beating , most unabashedly macho . " However , Kiedis recalls that during the composition of the album , Beinhorn encouraged him to step away from his improvisational speed @-@ rap style in favor of slower , crooning vocals . At the time , Kiedis was very uncomfortable with his singing voice , and felt that the new style was " sappy " . Kiedis also observed that guitarist Hillel Slovak 's playing evolved during his time away from the group in What Is This ? , and that Slovak had adopted a more fluid style featuring " sultry " elements as opposed to his original hard rock techniques . 
 On The Uplift Mofo Party Plan , Slovak experimented with genres outside of traditional funk music including reggae and speed metal . His melodic riff featured in the song " Behind the Sun " inspired the group to create " pretty " songs with an emphasis on melody . Kiedis describes the song as " pure Hillel inspiration " . Slovak also used a talk box on the song " Funky Crime " , in which he would sing into a tube while playing to create psychedelic effects . Flea incorporated a " slap " bass style on the album , which would become a staple of the band 's early work . " <unk> " features a " loose , swinging groove " and a " sky @-@ scraping " guitar solo . " Skinny Sweaty Man " contains a rapid tempo and has been described as " hardcore garage psychedelic <unk> " , while " No Chump Love Sucker " displays punk rock and thrash influences . The album also features a cover of Bob Dylan 's " Subterranean Homesick Blues " , which abandons nearly all of the original song 's folk stylistics in favor of the band 's signature funk @-@ rock leanings . 
 = = = Lyrics = = = 
 The majority of the lyrics in the album focus on friendships between the band members , sex , and life in Los Angeles . The reunion of the four original members of the group had a great influence over the lyrics ; Kiedis explained that " a lot of the jubilation in the lyrics of that record are about being united . " Kiedis was also inspired by personal experiences of himself and rest of the band members . During the recording of Freaky Styley , Kiedis and Slovak indulged in heavy cocaine use . When Slovak was under the influence , he would often wear brightly colored clothing and dance in a " shuffling " fashion , which became the inspiration for the song " Skinny Sweaty Man " from Uplift . The song " No Chump Love Sucker " was also inspired by Slovak ; during the recording of the album , Slovak had been " left high and dry " by a girlfriend who left him for someone who had " more money and more drugs " . The song served as a revenge song against " that type of evil , materialistic woman . " 
 " Funky Crime " was reflective of a conversation between the band and George Clinton while writing and recording Freaky Styley . Kiedis described the song as a lyrical description of the conversation , about how music itself is " color @-@ blind " but is " segregated by the media and radio based on their perceptions of the artists . " Kiedis wrote " Me and My Friends " , a song which " came together nicely " , while driving home from San Francisco with his childhood friend Joe Walters . " <unk> " details the history of rock and roll . Kiedis said that " Love Trilogy " became one of the group 's all time favorite songs ; it is about " loving the things that aren 't necessarily perfect or always lovable " . He explained that " For years , whenever someone would question our lyrics , Flea would say , ' Read ' Love Trilogy ' and you 'll know what real lyrics are all about . ' " 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 EMI originally refused to release the album unless the Chili Peppers changed the name of the song " Party on Your Pussy " ; the band subsequently renamed the song " Special Secret Song Inside " . The Uplift Mofo Party Plan was released on September 29 , 1987 and peaked at number 148 on the Billboard 200 , which was far more successful than any of the band 's previous releases . It was the band 's first album to enter the Billboard 200 , and has since been certified Gold in the United States . The band filmed a music video for the album 's lead single , " Fight Like a Brave " , but the song failed to make an impact on any Billboard charts . " Behind the Sun " was not released as a single until 1992 , after the band had released two subsequent albums , Mother 's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik . The single , which was released to promote the Chili Peppers ' What Hits ! ? compilation album , peaked at number 7 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart . 
 The album also helped the Red Hot Chili Peppers earn a dedicated cult fanbase in Los Angeles . One of these fans was John Frusciante , who would later join the band as guitarist after Slovak 's death . Frusciante recalled : " The first time I saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers live was at the Variety Arts Center , and that was really amazing ... They were going for this real hard sound . Hillel was doing all this awesome feedback and stuff . It was the most magical experience I ever had in the experience of a show . " Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovak 's work , and explained , " I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel 's playing and I just took it sideways from there . " 
 The album received mixed reviews from critics upon its release . Duncan Strauss of the Los Angeles Times described the album as " hit @-@ and @-@ miss " ; while he praised the " tender tunefulness " of " Behind the Sun " , he felt that the majority of the songs " wear pretty thin pretty fast , further suggesting that this is a band that 's in command on stage — but in trouble in the studio . " Bill Meredith of Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars , observing that " The energy of having these four friends from Los Angeles back together jumps out of the opening anthem ' Fight Like a Brave ' and the experimental ' Funky Crime ' ... Slovak and Irons brought things to the Chili Peppers that no one else ever has . " Blaine Sayers of Consequence of Sound praised Slovak 's guitar work on the album , saying that " Slovak proves with these tracks that he was not just a funk guitarist , but he could rock with the best thrash metal bands of the 80s as well . " However , in The New Rolling Stone Record Guide , 4th Edition , author Nathan Brackett was highly critical of The Uplift Mofo Party Plan , giving it two out of five stars . He felt that the album was a minor improvement over the band 's last two efforts , but felt that the group 's offbeat humor detracted from the album : " The California quartet brings a modicum of structure to The Uplift Mofo Party Plan , but their humor — as their famous ' party on your pussy ' chorus demonstrates — wouldn 't merit an audience in a high @-@ school locker room . " 
 = = Tour and Slovak 's death = = 
 The band embarked on an extensive international tour to promote the album . The Chili Peppers noted that during the tour , their fan base had rapidly increased both in size and enthusiasm . Kiedis recalled " During the Uplift tour I remember actually feeling a change taking place not just in the amount of people showing up at the gigs but the intensity of the fan base . " Flea added that " We were in love with those songs and how much fun we were having playing them . " 
 Despite the band 's new enthusiasm , Kiedis and Slovak continued to struggle with their worsening drug addictions . Both Kiedis and Slovak stopped using heroin prior to the tour and decided to help each other " steer clear " of the drug . During the tour both experienced intense heroin withdrawal , with Slovak much more unstable than Kiedis . His withdrawal symptoms took a toll on his ability to play his instrument ; at one point Slovak had a mental breakdown and was unable to play a show , leaving the rest of the band to play an entire set with no guitar . He recovered a few days later , but his bandmates felt he was not healthy enough to perform and replaced Slovak with DeWayne McKnight for a few shows . After a few days with McKnight , the band decided to give Slovak another chance , and he rejoined for the European leg of the tour . Kiedis attempted to take Slovak to drug addiction counseling , but Slovak had difficulty admitting that his addiction was serious enough to require medical help . 
 Upon returning home , Slovak isolated himself from the rest of his bandmates , and struggled to resist the drug without the mutual support provided by his friends , Kiedis in particular . A few weeks after the band returned from the tour , the members attempted to get in contact with Slovak , but were unable to find him for several days . Slovak was found dead by police in his Hollywood apartment on June 27 , 1988 . During his autopsy , authorities determined that he had died on June 25 , 1988 due to a heroin overdose . Irons subsequently left the group , saying that he did not want to be part of a group where his friends were dying . Kiedis and Flea debated whether they should continue making music , but ultimately decided to move ahead , hoping to continue what Slovak " helped build " . The two recruited eighteen @-@ year @-@ old guitarist John Frusciante , who was a fan of the group and idolized Slovak . To replace Irons , the group held a lengthy open audition process , and eventually chose drummer Chad Smith .

 = Fort Ticonderoga = 
 Fort Ticonderoga , formerly Fort Carillon , is a large 18th @-@ century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain in northern New York in the United States . It was constructed by Canadian @-@ born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière , Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757 during the Seven Years ' War , often referred to as the French and Indian War in the US . It was of strategic importance during the 18th @-@ century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France , and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War . 
 The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids @-@ infested La Chute River in the 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) between Lake Champlain and Lake George and was strategically placed in conflicts over trade routes between the British @-@ controlled Hudson River Valley and the French @-@ controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley . The terrain amplified the importance of the site . Both lakes were long and narrow , oriented north – south , as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains extending as far south as Georgia , creating the near @-@ impassable mountainous terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded . The name " Ticonderoga " comes from the Iroquois word <unk> : ken , meaning " it is at the junction of two waterways " . 
 During the 1758 Battle of Carillon , 4 @,@ 000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16 @,@ 000 British troops near the fort . In 1759 , the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort . During the American Revolutionary War , the fort again saw action in May 1775 when the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold captured it from the British in a surprise attack . Cannons captured were transported to Boston where their deployment forced the British to abandon the city in March 1776 . The Americans held the fort until June 1777 , when British forces under General John Burgoyne occupied high ground above it and threatened the Continental Army troops , leading them to withdraw from the fort and its surrounding defenses . The only direct attack on the fort took place in September 1777 , when John Brown led 500 Americans in an unsuccessful attempt to capture the fort from about 100 British defenders . 
 The British abandoned the fort after the failure of the Saratoga campaign , and it ceased to be of military value after 1781 . It fell into ruin , leading people to strip it of some of its usable stone , metal , and woodwork . It became a stop on tourist routes of the area in the 19th century . Its private owners restored the fort early in the 20th century . A foundation now operates the fort as a tourist attraction , museum , and research center . 
 = = Geography and early history = = 
 Lake Champlain , which forms part of the border between New York and Vermont , and the Hudson River together formed an important travel route that was used by Indians before the arrival of European colonists . The route was relatively free of obstacles to navigation , with only a few portages . One strategically important place on the route lies at a narrows near the southern end of Lake Champlain , where Ticonderoga Creek , known in Colonial times as the La Chute River , enters the lake , carrying water from Lake George . Although the site provides commanding views of the southern extent of Lake Champlain , Mount Defiance , at 853 ft ( 260 m ) , and two other hills ( Mount Hope and Mount Independence ) overlook the area . 
 Indians had occupied the area for centuries before French explorer Samuel de Champlain first arrived there in 1609 . Champlain recounted that the <unk> , with whom he was traveling , battled a group of Iroquois nearby . In 1642 , French missionary Isaac <unk> was the first white man to traverse the portage at Ticonderoga while escaping a battle between the Iroquois and members of the Huron tribe . 
 The French , who had colonized the Saint Lawrence River valley to the north , and the English , who had taken over the Dutch settlements that became the Province of New York to the south , began contesting the area as early as 1691 , when Pieter Schuyler built a small wooden fort at the Ticonderoga point on the western shore of the lake . These colonial conflicts reached their height in the French and Indian War , which began in 1754 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 In 1755 , following the Battle of Lake George , the Marquis de Vaudreuil , the governor of the French Province of Canada , sent his cousin Michel Chartier de Lotbinière to design and construct a fortification at this militarily important site , which the French called Fort Carillon . The name " Carillon " has variously been attributed to the name of a former French officer , Philippe de Carrion du <unk> , who established a trading post at the site in the late 17th century , or ( more commonly ) to the sounds made by the La Chute River , which were said to resemble the chiming bells of a carillon . Construction on the star @-@ shaped fort , which Lotbinière based on designs of the renowned French military engineer Vauban , began in October 1755 and then proceeded slowly during the warmer @-@ weather months of 1756 and 1757 , using troops stationed at nearby Fort St. Frédéric and from Canada . 
 The work in 1755 consisted primarily of beginning construction on the main walls and on the Lotbinière redoubt , an outwork to the west of the site that provided additional coverage of the La Chute River . The next year saw the building of the four main bastions and a sawmill on the La Chute . Work slowed in 1757 , when many of the troops prepared for and participated in the attack on Fort William Henry . The barracks and demi @-@ <unk> were not completed until spring 1758 . 
 = = = Walls and bastions = = = 
 The French built the fort to control the south end of Lake Champlain and prevent the British from gaining military access to the lake . Consequently , its most important defenses , the Reine and Germaine bastions , were directed to the northeast and northwest , away from the lake , with two demi @-@ <unk> further extending the works on the land side . The Joannes and Languedoc bastions overlooked the lake to the south , providing cover for the landing area outside the fort . The walls were seven feet ( 2 @.@ 1 meters ) high and fourteen feet ( 4 @.@ 3 meters ) thick , and the whole works was surrounded by a glacis and a dry moat five feet ( 1 @.@ 5 meters ) deep and 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) wide . When the walls were first erected in 1756 , they were made of squared wooden timbers , with earth filling the gap . The French then began to dress the walls with stone from a quarry about one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) away , although this work was never fully completed . When the main defenses became ready for use , the fort was armed with cannons hauled from Montreal and Fort St. Frédéric . 
 = = = Inside and outside = = = 
 The fort contained three barracks and four storehouses . One bastion held a bakery capable of producing 60 loaves of bread a day . A powder magazine was hacked out of the bedrock beneath the Joannes bastion . All the construction within the fort was of stone . 
 A wooden palisade protected an area outside the fort between the southern wall and the lake shore . This area contained the main landing for the fort and additional storage facilities and other works necessary for maintenance of the fort . When it became apparent in 1756 that the fort was too far to the west of the lake , the French constructed an additional redoubt to the east to enable cannon to cover the lake 's narrows . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 By 1758 , the fort was largely complete ; the only ongoing work thereafter consisted of dressing the walls with stone . Still , General Montcalm and two of his military engineers surveyed the works in 1758 and found something to criticize in almost every aspect of the fort 's construction ; the buildings were too tall and thus easier for attackers ' cannon fire to hit , the powder magazine leaked , and the masonry was of poor quality . The critics apparently failed to notice the fort 's significant strategic weakness : several nearby hills commanded the fort . Lotbinière , who may have won the job of building the fort only because he was related to Governor Vaudreuil , had lost a bid to become Canada 's chief engineer to Nicolas <unk> de Pontleroy , one of the two surveying engineers , in 1756 , all of which may explain the highly negative report . Lotbinière 's career suffered for years afterwards . 
 William Nester , in his exhaustive analysis of the Battle of Carillon , notes additional problems with the fort 's construction . The fort was small for a Vauban @-@ style fort , about 500 feet ( 150 m ) wide , with a barracks capable of holding only 400 soldiers . Storage space inside the fort was similarly limited , requiring the storage of provisions outside the fort 's walls in exposed places . Its cistern was small , and the water quality was supposedly poor .

 In August 1757 , the French captured Fort William Henry in an action launched from Fort Carillon . This , and a string of other French victories in 1757 , prompted the British to organize a large @-@ scale attack on the fort as part of a multi @-@ campaign strategy against French Canada . In June 1758 , British General James Abercromby began amassing a large force at Fort William Henry in preparation for the military campaign directed up the Champlain Valley . These forces landed at the north end of Lake George , only four miles from the fort , on July 6 . The French general Louis @-@ Joseph de Montcalm , who had only arrived at Carillon in late June , engaged his troops in a flurry of work to improve the fort 's outer defenses . They built , over two days , entrenchments around a rise between the fort and Mount Hope , about three @-@ quarters of a mile ( one kilometer ) northwest of the fort , and then constructed an abatis ( felled trees with sharpened branches pointing out ) below these entrenchments . Abercromby 's failure to advance directly to the fort on July 7 made much of this defensive work possible . Abercromby 's second @-@ in @-@ command , Brigadier General George Howe , had been killed when his column encountered a French reconnaissance troop . Abercromby " felt [ Howe 's death ] most heavily " and may have been unwilling to act immediately . 
 On July 8 , 1758 , Abercromby ordered a frontal attack against the hastily assembled French works . Abercromby tried to move rapidly against the few French defenders , opting to forgo field cannon and relying instead on the numerical superiority of his 16 @,@ 000 troops . In the Battle of Carillon , the British were soundly defeated by the 4 @,@ 000 French defenders . The battle took place far enough away from the fort that its guns were rarely used . The battle gave the fort a reputation for impregnability , which affected future military operations in the area , notably during the American Revolutionary War . Following the French victory , Montcalm , anticipating further British attacks , ordered additional work on the defenses , including the construction of the Germain and Pontleroy redoubts ( named for the engineers under whose direction they were constructed ) to the northeast of the fort . However , the British did not attack again in 1758 , so the French withdrew all but a small garrison of men for the winter in November . 
 The fort was captured the following year by the British under General Jeffrey Amherst in the 1759 Battle of Ticonderoga . In this confrontation 11 @,@ 000 British troops , using emplaced artillery , drove off a token garrison of 400 Frenchmen . The French , in withdrawing , used explosives to destroy what they could of the fort and spiked or dumped cannons that they did not take with them . Although the British worked in 1759 and 1760 to repair and improve the fort , the fort saw no more significant action in the war . After the war , the British garrisoned it with a small numbers of troops and allowed it to fall into disrepair . Colonel Frederick Haldimand , in command of the fort in 1773 , wrote that it was in " ruinous condition " . 
 = = = Early Revolutionary War = = = 
 In 1775 , Fort Ticonderoga , in disrepair , was still manned by a token force . Fort Ticonderoga was still extremely useful to the British as a supply and communication link between Canada and New York . On May 10 , 1775 , less than one month after the American Revolutionary War was ignited with the battles of Lexington and Concord , the British garrison of 48 soldiers was surprised by a small force of Green Mountain Boys , along with militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut , led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold . Allen claims to have said , " Come out you old Rat ! " to the fort 's commander , Captain William Delaplace . He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort " In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress ! " ; however , his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort 's commander , who did later appear and surrender his sword . 
 With the capture of the fort , the Patriot forces obtained a large supply of cannons and other armaments , much of which Henry Knox transported to Boston during the winter of 1775 – 1776 . Ticonderoga 's cannons were instrumental in ending the Siege of Boston when they were used to fortify Dorchester Heights . With Dorchester Heights secured the British were forced to evacuate Boston in March of 1776 . The capture of Fort Ticonderoga made communication between the British Canadian and American commands much more difficult . 
 Benedict Arnold remained in control of the fort until 1 @,@ 000 Connecticut troops under the command of Benjamin Hinman arrived in June 1775 . Because of a series of political maneuvers and miscommunications , Arnold was never notified that Hinman was to take command . After a delegation from Massachusetts ( which had issued Arnold 's commission ) arrived to clarify the matter , Arnold resigned his commission and departed , leaving the fort in Hinman 's hands . 
 Beginning in July 1775 , Ticonderoga was used as a staging area for the invasion of Quebec to begin in September . Under the leadership of generals Philip Schuyler and Richard Montgomery , men and materiel for the invasion accumulated there through July and August . On August 28 , after receiving word that British forces at Fort Saint @-@ Jean , not far from the New York – Quebec border , were nearing completion of boats to launch onto Lake Champlain , Montgomery launched the invasion , leading 1 @,@ 200 troops down the lake . Ticonderoga continued to serve as a staging base for the action in Quebec until the battle and siege at Quebec City that resulted in Montgomery 's death . 
 In May 1776 , British troops began to arrive at Quebec City , where they broke the Continental Army 's siege . The British chased the American forces back to Ticonderoga in June , and , after several months of shipbuilding , moved down Lake Champlain under Guy Carleton in October . The British destroyed a small fleet of American gunboats in the Battle of Valcour Island in mid @-@ October , but snow was already falling , so the British retreated to winter quarters in Quebec . About 1 @,@ 700 troops from the Continental Army , under the command of Colonel Anthony Wayne , wintered at Ticonderoga . The British offensive resumed the next year in the Saratoga campaign under General John Burgoyne . 
 = = = Saratoga campaign = = = 
 During the summer of 1776 , the Americans , under the direction of General Schuyler , and later under General Horatio Gates , added substantial defensive works to the area . Mount Independence , which is almost completely surrounded by water , was fortified with trenches near the water , a horseshoe battery part way up the side , a citadel at the summit , and redoubts armed with cannons surrounding the summit area . These defenses were linked to Ticonderoga with a pontoon bridge that was protected by land batteries on both sides . The works on Mount Hope , the heights above the site of Montcalm 's victory , were improved to include a star @-@ shaped fort . Mount Defiance remained unfortified . 
 In March 1777 , American generals were strategizing about possible British military movements and considered an attempt on the Hudson River corridor a likely possibility . General Schuyler , heading the forces stationed at Ticonderoga , requested 10 @,@ 000 troops to guard Ticonderoga and 2 @,@ 000 to guard the Mohawk River valley against British invasion from the north . George Washington , who had never been to Ticonderoga ( his only visit was to be in 1783 ) , believed that an overland attack from the north was unlikely , because of the alleged impregnability of Ticonderoga . This , combined with continuing incursions up the Hudson River valley by British forces occupying New York City , led Washington to believe that any attack on the Albany area would be from the south , which , as it was part of the supply line to Ticonderoga , would necessitate a withdrawal from the fort . As a result , no significant actions were taken to further fortify Ticonderoga or significantly increase its garrison . The garrison , about 2 @,@ 000 men under General Arthur St. Clair , was too small to man all the defenses . 
 General Gates , who oversaw the northern defenses , was aware that Mount Defiance threatened the fort . John Trumbull had pointed this out as early as 1776 , when a shot fired from the fort was able to reach Defiance 's summit , and several officers inspecting the hill noted that there were approaches to its summit where gun carriages could be pulled up the sides . As the garrison was too small to properly defend all the existing works in area , Mount Defiance was left undefended . Anthony Wayne left Ticonderoga in April 1777 to join Washington 's army ; he reported to Washington that " all was well " , and that the fort " can never be carried , without much loss of blood " . 
 General Burgoyne led 7 @,@ 800 British and Hessian forces south from Quebec in June 1777 . After occupying nearby Fort Crown Point without opposition on June 30 , he prepared to besiege Ticonderoga . Burgoyne realized the tactical advantage of the high ground , and had his troops haul cannons to the top of Mount Defiance . Faced with bombardment from the heights ( even before any shots had been fired from those cannons ) , General St. Clair ordered Ticonderoga abandoned on July 5 , 1777 . Burgoyne 's troops moved in the next day , with advance guards pursuing the retreating Americans . Washington , on hearing of Burgoyne 's advance and the retreat from Ticonderoga , stated that the event was " not apprehended , nor within the compass of my reasoning " . News of the abandonment of the " Impregnable Bastion " without a fight , caused " the greatest surprise and alarm " throughout the colonies . After public outcry over his actions , General St. Clair was court @-@ martialed in 1778 . He was cleared on all charges . 
 = = = One last attack = = = 
 Following the British capture of Ticonderoga , it and the surrounding defenses were garrisoned by 700 British and Hessian troops under the command of Brigadier General Henry Watson Powell . Most of these forces were on Mount Independence , with only 100 each at Fort Ticonderoga and a blockhouse they were constructing on top of Mount Defiance . George Washington sent General Benjamin Lincoln into Vermont to " divide and distract the enemy " . Aware that the British were housing American prisoners in the area , Lincoln decided to test the British defenses . On September 13 , he sent 500 men to Skenesboro , which they found the British had abandoned , and 500 each against the defenses on either side of the lake at Ticonderoga . Colonel John Brown led the troops on the west side , with instructions to release prisoners if possible , and attack the fort if it seemed feasible . 
 Early on September 18 , Brown 's troops surprised a British contingent holding some prisoners near the Lake George landing , while a detachment of his troops sneaked up Mount Defiance , and captured most of the sleeping construction crew . Brown and his men then moved down the portage trail toward the fort , surprising more troops and releasing prisoners along the way . The fort 's occupants were unaware of the action until Brown 's men and British troops occupying the old French lines skirmished . At this point Brown 's men dragged two captured six @-@ pound guns up to the lines , and began firing on the fort . The men who had captured Mount Defiance began firing a twelve @-@ pounder from that site . The column that was to attack Mount Independence was delayed , and its numerous defenders were alerted to the action at the fort below before the attack on their position began . Their musket fire , as well as grapeshot fired from ships anchored nearby , intimidated the Americans sufficiently that they never launched an assault on the defensive positions on Mount Independence . A stalemate persisted , with regular exchanges of cannon fire , until September 21 , when 100 Hessians , returning from the Mohawk Valley to support Burgoyne , arrived on the scene to provide reinforcement to the besieged fort . Brown eventually sent a truce party to the fort to open negotiations ; the party was fired on , and three of its five members were killed . Brown , realizing that the weaponry they had was insufficient to take the fort , decided to withdraw . Destroying many bateaux and seizing a ship on Lake George , he set off to annoy British positions on that lake . His action resulted in the freeing of 118 Americans and the capture of 293 British troops , while suffering fewer than ten casualties . 
 = = = Abandonment = = = 
 Following Burgoyne 's defeat at Saratoga , the fort at Ticonderoga became increasingly irrelevant . The British abandoned it and nearby Fort Crown Point in November 1777 , destroying both as best they could prior to their withdrawal . The fort was occasionally reoccupied by British raiding parties in the following years , but it no longer held a prominent strategic role in the war . It was finally abandoned by the British for good in 1781 , following the surrender at Yorktown . Area residents began stripping the fort of usable building materials , even melting some of the cannons down for their metal in the years following the war . 
 = = Tourist attraction = = 
 In 1785 , the fort 's lands became the property of the state of New York . The state donated the property to Columbia and Union colleges in 1803 , which sold it to William Ferris Pell in 1820 . Pell first used the property as a summer retreat , but the completion of railroads and canals connecting the area to New York City brought tourists to the area , so he converted his summer house , known as The Pavilion , into a hotel to serve the tourist trade . In 1848 , the Hudson River School artist Russell Smith painted Ruins of Fort Ticonderoga , depicting the condition of the fort . 
 The Pell family , a politically important clan with influence throughout American history ( from William C. C. Claiborne , the first Governor of Louisiana , to a Senator from Rhode Island , Claiborne Pell ) , restored the fort in 1909 and formally opened it to the public . The ceremonies , which commemorated the 300th anniversary of the discovery of Lake Champlain by European explorers , were attended by President William Howard Taft . Stephen Hyatt Pell , who spearheaded the restoration effort , founded the Fort Ticonderoga Association in 1931 , which is now responsible for the fort . Funding for the restoration also came from Robert M. Thompson , father of Steven 's wife Sarah Gibbs Thompson . Between 1900 and 1950 , the historically important lands around the fort , including Mount Defiance , Mount Independence , and much of Mount Hope , were also acquired by the foundation . The fort was rearmed with fourteen 24 @-@ pound cannons provided by the British government . These cannons had been cast in England for use during the Revolution , but the war ended before they were shipped over . 
 The fort is now a tourist attraction , early American military museum , and research center . The fort opens around May 10 , the anniversary of the 1775 capture , every year , closing in late October . It has been on a watchlist of National Historic Landmarks since 1998 , because of the poor condition of some of the walls and the 19th @-@ century pavilion constructed by William Ferris Pell . The pavilion is , as of early 2009 , undergoing restoration . In 2008 , the powder magazine destroyed by the French in 1759 was reconstructed by <unk> Associates Architects , based in part on the original 1755 plans . Also in 2008 , the withdrawal of a major backer 's financial support forced the museum , facing significant budget deficits , to consider selling one of its major art works , Thomas Cole 's <unk> , View near Ticonderoga . However , fundraising activities succeeded in making this unnecessary . 
 The not @-@ for @-@ profit Living History Education Foundation has teacher programs at Fort Ticonderoga that run in the summer and last approximately one week . The program trains teachers in how to teach Living History techniques , and to understand and interpret the importance of Fort Ticonderoga during the French and Indian War and the American Revolution . 
 The Pell 's estate is located north of the fort . In 1921 , Sarah Pell undertook reconstruction of the gardens , known now as King 's gardens , and hired for this work Marian Cruger Coffin , one of the most famous American landscape architects . In 1995 , the gardens were restored and later opened for public .

 The name Ticonderoga has been given to five different U.S. Navy vessels and entire classes of cruisers and aircraft carriers . The fort was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960 . Included in the <unk> area are the fort itself , as well as Mount Independence and Mount Defiance . It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966 . The Ticonderoga pencil , manufactured by the Dixon Ticonderoga Corporation , is named for the fort .

 = Kingdom of Hungary ( 1000 – 1301 ) = 
 The Kingdom of Hungary came into existence in Central Europe when Stephen I , Grand Prince of the Hungarians , was crowned king in 1000 or 1001 . He reinforced central authority and forced his subjects to accept Christianity . Although written sources emphasize the role played by German and Italian knights and clerics in the process , a significant part of the Hungarian vocabulary for agriculture , religion and state was taken from Slavic languages . Civil wars and pagan uprisings , along with attempts by the Holy Roman Emperors to expand their authority over Hungary , jeopardized the new monarchy . The monarchy stabilized during the reigns of Ladislaus I ( 1077 – 1095 ) and Coloman ( 1095 – 1116 ) . These rulers occupied Croatia and Dalmatia , but both realms retained their autonomous position . Their successors — especially Béla II ( 1131 – 1141 ) , Béla III ( 1176 – 1196 ) , Andrew II ( 1205 – 1235 ) , and Béla IV ( 1235 – 1270 ) — continued this policy of expansion towards the Balkan Peninsula and the lands east of the Carpathian Mountains , transforming their kingdom into one of the major powers of medieval Europe . 
 Rich in uncultivated lands , silver , gold , and salt deposits , Hungary became the preferred destination of mainly German , Italian and French colonists . These immigrants were mostly peasants who settled in villages , but craftsmen and merchants also came . Their arrival had a key role in the shaping of an urban lifestyle , habits and culture in medieval Hungary . The location of the kingdom at the crossroads of international trade routes favored the coexistence of several cultures . Romanesque , Gothic and Renaissance buildings and literary works written in Latin prove the predominantly Roman Catholic character of the culture , but Orthodox , and even non @-@ Christian ethnic minority communities also existed . Latin was the language of legislation , administration and judiciary , but " linguistic pluralism " contributed to the survival of many tongues , including a great variety of Slavic dialects . 
 The predominance of royal estates initially assured the sovereign 's preeminent position , but the alienation of royal lands gave rise to the emergence of a self @-@ conscious group of lesser landholders , known as " royal servants " . They forced Andrew II to issue his Golden Bull of 1222 , " one of first examples of constitutional limits being placed on the powers of a European monarch " ( Francis Fukuyama ) . The kingdom received a major blow from the Mongol invasion of 1241 – 42 . Thereafter , Cuman and <unk> groups settled in the central lowlands , and colonists arrived from Moravia , Poland and other nearby countries . The erection of fortresses by landlords , promoted by the monarchs after the withdrawal of the Mongols , led to the development of semi @-@ autonomous " provinces " dominated by powerful magnates . Some of these magnates even challenged the authority of Andrew III ( 1290 – 1301 ) , the last male descendant of the native Árpád dynasty . His death was followed by a period of interregnum and anarchy . Central power was re @-@ established only in the early 1320s . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Hungarians , or Magyars , conquered the Carpathian Basin at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries . Here they found a predominantly Slavic @-@ speaking population . From their new homeland , they launched plundering raids against East Francia , Italy and other regions of Europe . Their raids were halted by Otto I , future Holy Roman Emperor , who defeated them at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955 . 
 Hungarians lived in patrilineal families , which were organized into clans that formed tribes . The tribal confederation was headed by the grand prince , always a member of the family descending from Árpád , the Hungarians ' leader around the time of their " land @-@ taking " . Contemporary authors described the Hungarians as nomads , but Ibn Rusta and others added that they also cultivated arable land . The great number of borrowings from Slavic languages prove that the Hungarians adopted new techniques and a more settled lifestyle in Central Europe . The cohabitation of Hungarians and local ethnic groups is also reflected in the assemblages of the " Bijelo Brdo culture " , which emerged in the mid @-@ 10th century . 
 Although they were pagan , the Hungarians demonstrated a tolerant attitude towards Christians , Jews , and Muslims . The Byzantine Church was the first to successfully proselytize among their leaders : in 948 the <unk> , and around 952 the gyula , were baptized in Constantinople . In contrast , the grand prince Géza ( c . 970 – 997 ) received baptism according to the Latin rite . He erected fortresses and invited foreign warriors to develop a new army based on heavy cavalry . Géza also arranged the marriage of his son , Stephen , with Giselle of Bavaria , a princess from the family of the Holy Roman Emperors . 
 When Géza died in 997 , his son had to fight for his succession with Koppány , the eldest member of the House of Árpád . Assisted by German heavy cavalry , Stephen emerged the victor in the decisive battle in 998 . He applied for a royal crown to Pope Sylvester II , who granted his request with the consent of Emperor Otto III .
