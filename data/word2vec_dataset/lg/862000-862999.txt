 The shock occurred on June 28 , 1991 at 07 : 43 : 55 local time , and was the result of thrust faulting on the Clamshell – Sawpit Fault at the southern boundary of the San Gabriel Mountains . At less than 0 @.@ 39 in ( 1 cm ) , the total amount of uplift was very minimal , considering the 6 ft 7 in ( 2 m ) of vertical displacement that was observed during the 1971 San Fernando earthquake . The uplift initiated about two million years ago , and is a result of the convergence of the Pacific and North American Plates near the restraining bend of the San Andreas Fault .

 The earthquake was felt from Santa Barbara in the north , to Palm Springs in the east , and south to the Mexico – United States border . It was centered about 7 @.@ 5 miles ( 12 @.@ 1 km ) northeast of Sierra Madre . Hundreds of homes were damaged and at least three roads leading up to Mount Wilson were blocked by landslides . A woman was killed when a steel beam fell at the Santa Anita Park raceway in Arcadia and another woman died as a result of a heart attack in Glendale . 
 Also in Arcadia , a Motel 6 was badly damaged . Other structural damage resulted from the shock . For example , both Monrovia and Pasadena each had more than a dozen buildings that were uninhabitable , but for the most part damage was limited to cracked plaster and broken windows . The Pasadena City Hall had moderate damage consisting of a cracked wall , dislodged marble barriers in the restrooms , and an offset dome . In Sierra Madre , four apartment buildings and nine homes were also tagged as uninhabitable . Of the more than 100 injuries that were reported in Arcadia , Pasadena , Glendale , and Sierra Madre , most were cuts , bruises , and sprains , but some serious injuries also occurred .

 The California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program ( CSMIP ) obtained 120 records from 48 ground response stations , 38 buildings , six dams , an airport control tower , and a power station . The individual stations that reported were as close as 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 km ) ( Cogswell Dam ) to as far as 50 miles ( 80 km ) ( <unk> ) , but most were within 40 km ( 25 mi ) . In downtown Pasadena , accelerations of <unk> were measured at the bottom floor of three buildings , but the duration of strong motion was only about two seconds . At the Altadena station ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ( 13 km ) from the epicenter ) .46g was recorded . The Cogswell Dam station recorded a peak horizontal acceleration of <unk> , but no major damage occurred .

 Although the long term slip rate of the constituent faults that make up the Sierra Madre Fault Zone are not precisely known , several studies have put forth scenarios for possible future activity . Two independent reports suggested that if the complete ( 62 mi ( 100 km ) ) fault system were to rupture , it could result in a Ms 7 @.@ 7 shock similar to the 1952 Kern County earthquake . One researcher stated that the recurrence interval for such an event would be greater than 5 @,@ 000 years . Another proposal was for one of the seven individual segments to rupture in a <unk> – 6 @.@ 6 event , comparable with the 1971 San Fernando earthquake . The recurrence interval for this type of event was placed at 200 years . 
 = 1986 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1986 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 , 1986 , and lasted until November 30 , 1986 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin . During the 1986 season , the first subtropical depression formed in the first week of June , while the last tropical cyclone dissipated at the end of the third week of November . The 1986 season had lower than average activity because of an ongoing El Niño event , and was the least active season in the North Atlantic since the 1983 Atlantic hurricane season . This was also the first season since 1972 to have no major hurricanes . Earl was the strongest hurricane of the season , reaching Category 2 status . Few storms caused significant damage ; Hurricane Bonnie caused heavy rains and flooding across southeast Texas when it made landfall near Sea Rim State Park . Hurricane Charley caused limited damage in North Carolina and Massachusetts , but crossed the Atlantic as an extratropical cyclone and caused considerable damage in the British Isles . 
 = = Seasonal forecast and summary = = 
 Dr. William M. Gray of Colorado State University issued forecasts on May 29 and July 28 indicating within both forecasts the anticipation of a below normal hurricane season . In May , a total of 8 named tropical storms were expected , with four hurricane expected , 15 days with hurricanes , and a total of 35 days with a tropical storm active in the northern Atlantic ocean . In July , the numbers were dropped to a total of 7 named storms , 4 hurricanes , 10 hurricane days , and 25 days with a named tropical storm , which almost perfectly verified . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 36 , which is classified as " below normal " . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots ( 39 mph , 63 km / h ) or tropical storm strength . Subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total .

 = = = Tropical Storm Andrew = = = 
 In early June , a large area of disturbed weather persisted over the Greater Antilles , bringing heavy rains to the islands . The area moved northward , developing a circulation over the Bahamas . Strong upper @-@ level winds caused when satellite imagery showed a circulation developing over the Bahamas . Strong upper @-@ level winds caused the structure to resemble a subtropical cyclone , and as a result , the system was classified as a subtropical depression on June 5 . The depression moved to the northwest and transitioned into a tropical storm on June 6 ; it was named Andrew about 258 mi ( 415 km ) southeast of Charleston , South Carolina . The tropical storm approached the South Carolina coast within 115 mi ( 185 km ) before recurving to the northeast on June 7 . The storm passed within 70 mi ( 110 km ) of Cape Hatteras while recurving , while near its peak intensity of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . The storm accelerated to the northeast , briefly crossing into the forecasting territory of Environment Canada , the first of three storms of the season to do so , before ultimately being absorbed by a low pressure system over Canada on June 8 . 
 While active , Andrew posed a threat to the Carolinas . Gale warnings were posted from an area ranging from Cape Lookout to south of Virginia Beach , Virginia on June 7 . Waves reached heights of 12 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) off the coast of the Carolinas , which killed a person on Ocracoke Island . Three companions were also swept out , all of whom made it back to shore . At Wrightsville Beach and Carolina Beach , at least 40 swimmers were caught in the currents , four of whom were hospitalized . The precursor to the storm produced heavy rainfall across Jamaica that caused a deadly flood event . 
 = = = Hurricane Bonnie = = = 
 During late June , a frontal trough drifted into the northeastern Gulf of Mexico , and by June 22 a surface circulation formed . Tracking west @-@ northwestward , it developed into Tropical Depression Two on June 23 while located about 330 miles ( 535 km ) south of Pensacola , Florida . The next day , it attained tropical storm status , and with continued favorable conditions attained hurricane status on June 25 to the south of Louisiana . Bonnie turned to the northwest and made landfall near Sea Rim State Park in Texas . The storm quickly weakened over land as it turned to the north and northeast , and on June 28 it was absorbed by an approaching frontal zone in southeastern Missouri . 
 Prior to moving ashore , 22 @,@ 000 people were evacuated . Upon making landfall , Hurricane Bonnie produced a storm surge peaking at 5 @.@ 2 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) at Sabine Pass . Rainfall from the storm peaked at 13 inches ( 330 mm ) in Ace , Texas , which caused some street flooding and destroyed a small dam in Liberty County , Texas . The hurricane also spawned eleven tornadoes , which , in combination with moderate winds , destroyed about 25 residencies in southwestern Louisiana . Three storm deaths occurred in the Port Arthur , Texas area ; two deaths occurred from separate car accidents , and another occurred after a partially paralyzed woman died in a house fire . Hurricane Bonnie caused minor damage totaling $ 2 million ( 1986 USD , $ 3 @.@ 5 million 2006 USD ) . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Three = = = 
 The third tropical depression of the season was detected early on July 27 in the open waters of the Atlantic , north of Bermuda . While about 180 miles ( 290 km ) north of the island , the storm was moving northward at 15 mph ( 24 km / h ) while its maximum sustained winds were about 30 mph ( 48 km / h ) . Later that afternoon , aircraft reconnaissance found no well @-@ defined circulation and the storm 's status was reduced from a depression . The depression never threatened any land areas . 
 = = = Unnumbered Tropical Depression = = = 
 A tropical disturbance was detected on August 4 in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico along the lower Texas coast . The low @-@ pressure system moved slowly toward land , limiting the system 's development . On August 5 , the system became organized enough to be considered a tropical depression . The storm moved inland overnight , dumping several inches of rain over South Texas and causing street flooding in Brownsville and nearby South Padre Island . The system caused rainfall up to 4 @.@ 45 inches ( 113 mm ) in some areas but had no major problems attributed to it . This storm was not carried as a depression operationally , and thus has no assigned number . 
 = = = Hurricane Charley = = = 
 Hurricane Charley was the costliest tropical cyclone of the season , and the first hurricane to threaten the east @-@ central United States since Hurricane Gloria in the previous year . The third tropical storm and second hurricane of the season , Charley formed as a subtropical low on August 13 along the Florida panhandle . A few days later intensified it into a tropical storm off the coast of South Carolina , and Charley attained hurricane status before moving across eastern North Carolina . It gradually weakened over the north Atlantic Ocean before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone , though its remnants remained identifiable for over a week until after crossing the British Isles and dissipating on August 30 . 
 The storm brought light to moderate precipitation along its path through the southeastern United States . In Georgia and South Carolina , the rainfall alleviated drought conditions . In North Carolina , where the hurricane made landfall , tidal flooding and downed trees were the primary impact . The storm brought high winds to southeastern Virginia , where 110 @,@ 000 people were left without power . Minor damage extended along the Atlantic coastline northward through Massachusetts . One traffic fatality was reported each in North Carolina and Virginia . Three people in Maryland died due to a plane crash related to the storm . Throughout the United States , Hurricane Charley caused an estimated $ 15 million in damage ( 1986 US $ , $ 29 million 2008 USD ) . 
 As an extratropical cyclone , Charley brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to Ireland and the United Kingdom , causing at least 11 deaths . In Ireland , the rainfall set records for 24 ‑ hour totals , including an accumulation of more than 7 @.@ 8 in ( 200 mm ) which set the record for the greatest daily rainfall total in the country . In the country , the rainfall caused widespread flooding , resulting in two rivers overflowing their banks . In the Dublin area , 451 buildings were flooded , some up to a depth of 8 ft ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) . In the United Kingdom , the storm caused downed trees and power lines , as well as flooded rivers .

 = = = Tropical Depression Six = = = 
 A tropical wave crossed the Caribbean sea , moving into a favorable upper environment in the western Caribbean sea on August 31 . The system formed into a weak tropical depression before crossing the Yucatán peninsula , becoming better organized as it moved into the south @-@ central and western Gulf of Mexico between September 1 and 3 . The system moved ashore east @-@ central Mexico before quickly dissipating as a tropical cyclone on September 4 . Satellite imagery revealed that its residual cloud pattern persisted over Mexico for an additional couple of days before degenerating . Heavy rainfall fell primarily north of its track , with the maximum across northeast Mexico falling at El Barranco / Altamira , where a total of 9 @.@ 33 inches ( 237 mm ) was measured . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Danielle = = = 
 On September 1 , a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and headed westward . The disturbance was below the 10 degree latitude as it organized into a tropical depression on September 7 and then a tropical storm later that day . Danielle peaked as a 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) storm on September 8 , while Reconnaissance Aircraft reported gusts of up to hurricane force . After passing through the Lesser Antilles , Danielle encountered vertical wind shear , and on September 10 it dissipated in the central Caribbean Sea . The remnants continued westward and ultimately regenerated into Tropical Storm Lester . 
 The islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines experienced wind gusts up to hurricane force , causing severe power outages and causing roof damage . In the Grenadines , the storm drove a coast guard ship aground , while five people were injured and hundreds of homes were destroyed . Torrential rainfall produced several mudslides , which , in turn , damaged roads , bridges , electricity , and water services . Danielle also destroyed twelve homes on the island of Barbados . In Trinidad and Tobago , strong flooding of up to four feet caused 27 landslides , destroying four bridges . The storm caused $ 8 million in damage in Tobago . Total damage from the storm amounted to $ 9 @.@ 2 million ( 1986 USD ) , mostly to crops , though no deaths were reported . 
 = = = Hurricane Earl = = = 
 The strongest storm of the season began as a tropical wave off Africa on September 4 . After moving across the tropical Atlantic Ocean it strengthened as Tropical Depression Five on September 10 while about 1240 miles ( 2000 km ) east of Puerto Rico . The depression quickly strengthened and reached hurricane strength on September 11 , peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on September 12 as it made a half circle , weakened to a Category 1 on September 16 and bounced back the way it came . Earl then turned north and became extratropical southeast of Newfoundland on September 19 . At its peak , Earl had sustained winds of 105 mph ( 170 km / h ) and a minimum central pressure of 979 mbar . 
 = = = Hurricane Frances = = = 
 First spotted as a tropical disturbance near the Lesser Antilles on November 15 , the system moved generally northward while slowly developing . The system organized into a tropical depression on November 18 and quickly strengthened into a tropical storm . The storm curved northeast and strengthened further , reaching hurricane strength on November 20 . However , a surface high @-@ pressure system to the north caused the storm to weaken as the vertical wind shear increased over its center . Frances was later absorbed by an extratropical cyclone on November 21 .

 = Shamrock Rovers F.C. = 
 Shamrock Rovers Football Club ( Irish : Cumann <unk> <unk> na <unk> ) is an Irish association football club based in Tallaght , South Dublin . The club 's senior team competes in the League of Ireland Premier Division and it is the most successful club in the Republic of Ireland . The club has won the League of Ireland title a record 17 times and the FAI Cup a record 24 times . Shamrock Rovers have supplied more players to the Republic of Ireland national football team ( 62 ) than any other club . In All @-@ Ireland competitions , such as the Intercity Cup , they hold the record for winning the most titles , having won seven cups overall . 
 Shamrock Rovers were founded in Ringsend , Dublin . The official date of the club 's foundation is 1901 . They won the League title at the first attempt in the 1922 – 23 season and established themselves as Republic of Ireland most successful club by 1949 , winning 44 major trophies . During the 1950s , the club won three League titles and two FAI Cups and became the first Irish team to compete in European competition , playing in the European Cup in 1957 . 
 They followed this by winning a record six FAI Cups in succession in the 1960s , when they were also one of the European club teams that spent the summer of 1967 in the United States , founding the United Soccer Association . They won the first of four League titles in a row in 1983 – 84 , after a long decline . 
 The club played at Glenmalure Park from 1926 to 1987 , when the owners controversially sold the stadium to property developers . Shamrock Rovers spent the next 22 years playing home games at various venues around Dublin and on occasions , Ireland . They moved into Tallaght Stadium prior to the start of the 2009 season after years of delays and legal disputes , during which time the club 's supporters saved them from extinction . 
 Shamrock Rovers wore green and white striped jerseys until 1926 , when they adopted the green and white hooped strip that they have worn ever since . Their club badge has featured a football and a shamrock throughout their history . The club has a relatively large support base and shares an intense rivalry with Bohemian Football Club . On 26 August 2011 Rovers became the first Irish side to reach the group stages of either of the top two European competitions by beating Partizan Belgrade in the play @-@ off round of the Europa League . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Foundation and early history = = = 
 The foundation of Shamrock Rovers is disputed amongst supporters of the club . No official documentation of the era exists . The earliest known mention of the club in the newspaper archives at the National Library of Ireland comes from 1901 and an article in the club programme from 28 December 1941 claims that the club was founded in this year . The only two certainties about the origins of the club in relation to what year they were formed are the facts that , Rovers played only exhibition games for the first two years of their existence and the club registered with the Leinster Football Association in 1901 . Essentially , the dispute is over whether the two years of exhibition games were played before or after the registration . Throughout the 1970s and 1980s , the date 1899 was written on the gates of Glenmalure Park but since the 1990s , 1901 has been adopted as the founding year by the various regimes which have run the club . 
 Shamrock Rovers originate from Ringsend , a Southside inner suburb of Dublin . The name of the club derives from Shamrock Avenue in Ringsend , where the first club rooms were secured . In September 1906 , after a few seasons in operation , Rovers withdrew from the First Division of the Leinster Senior League . In 1914 , they were resurrected and started playing their matches at Ringsend Park . However , the park became unavailable within two years . The club disbanded and played only exhibition games for the next five years . In 1921 , Shamrock Rovers were resurrected once more , as a Leinster Senior League outfit , and reached the final of the inaugural FAI Cup , where they lost to St James 's Gate in a fixture marred by crowd violence . The following season , the club won the League of Ireland title at the first attempt , going 21 games unbeaten and scoring 77 goals . In 1924 , an influential member of the League winning side of two years previous , Bob Fullam , returned to Rovers from Leeds United and combined with John Flood , John Fagan and Billy Farrell to complete the forward line known as The Four Fs . By the conclusion of their fifth season in the League of Ireland , the club had won three League titles and one FAI Cup . During the 1930s , the club won a further three League titles and five FAI Cups with Irish internationals , Paddy Moore and Jimmy Dunne playing key roles in their success , supported by crowds of up to 30 @,@ 000 people at Glenmalure Park . By 1949 , Shamrock Rovers had established themselves as Ireland 's most successful football club . Their 44 major trophies included six League of Ireland titles , 11 FAI Cups , seven League of Ireland Shields , six Leinster Senior Cups , two Dublin City Cups , four Intercity Cups and eight President 's Cups . 
 = = = Coad 's Colts = = = 
 In November 1949 , following the death of Jimmy Dunne , Paddy Coad reluctantly accepted the position of player @-@ manager having played with the club for almost eight years , in which time he had established himself as one of the best players in the League of Ireland . Coad opted for a radical youth policy and over the course of his first three years in charge , signed virtually the entire schoolboy international side to Rovers . He employed revolutionary training methods with extra emphasis on technical skill and possession which resulted in a fast , passing style of football that contributed significantly to the development of the game in Ireland . In 1954 , the club won the League of Ireland for the first time in fifteen years , while Paddy Ambrose finished the season as the team 's leading scorer . Led by players like Liam Tuohy and Coad himself , the team known as Coad 's Colts proceeded to win two more League titles and two FAI Cups , concluding the golden era of Irish football as one of its most successful teams . 
 = = = Six in a row = = = 
 After the departure of Coad in 1960 and an unsuccessful season under Albie Murphy , Seán Thomas took on the role of rebuilding the Rovers team which had suffered from the break @-@ up of Coad 's Colts . Paddy Ambrose and Ronnie Nolan had remained with the club and were joined by a large selection of signings including Irish internationals , Frank O ’ Neill and Johnny Fullam . The decision by Liam Tuohy to return to the club as captain , after four successful years at Newcastle United , effectively saw the completion of Thomas ' side . The club won every domestic honour except the Top Four Competition in the 1963 – 64 season and were narrowly defeated by holders and eventual finalists , Valencia , in the Inter @-@ Cities Fairs Cup . Thomas , however , quit the Hoops at the end of the season following a dispute with the Cunninghams ( Owners ) over team selection . Liam Tuohy took over as player @-@ manager and led the club to a further five FAI Cups in succession , completing a series of six , including a 3 – 0 defeat of League of Ireland champions , Waterford in 1968 , in front of 40 @,@ 000 people at Dalymount Park . The summer of 1967 had been spent in the United States , participating in the foundation of the United Soccer Association , where Rovers represented Boston as Boston Rovers . The 1968 – 69 season saw Mick Leech score a total of 56 goals for the club , including two in the last FAI Cup final of the Six in a Row period , against Cork Celtic . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 The Hoops ' defeat to Shelbourne in the first round of the FAI Cup in 1970 , their first defeat in 32 Cup games over seven years , marked the start of the decline in the fortunes of the club . Despite only narrowly missing out on the League title in the 1970 – 71 season in controversial circumstances , the next twelve years proved to be a disaster for the club both on and off the field . On 25 April 1971 , Rovers met Cork Hibs in Dalymount in a League play @-@ off watched by 28 @,@ 000 people . Their pre @-@ match buildup was thrown into disarray when players and directors clashed over win bonuses . Hibs won the play @-@ off 3 – 1 . The next season , the Cunninghams , now under the control of sons Arthur and Des , sold the club to three brothers from Dublin ; Paddy , Barton and Louis Kilcoyne . The Kilcoynes had witnessed decades of huge attendances at Irish football games and sought to take over the club primarily for business reasons . However , within the space of five years , the large crowds disappeared from Irish football stadia and combined with the demise of Drumcondra and Cork Hibs , the decline in fortunes of a number of top clubs and the lack of action by the FAI , the League of Ireland was plunged into a drastic decline . Faced with dwindling attendances , the Kilcoynes decided to starve the club and sold off senior players who were replaced by junior footballers . On a tour of Japan in 1975 , Mick Meagan and Theo Dunne ’ s young side defeated the Japanese national team 3 – 2 in front of 60 @,@ 000 spectators at the Olympic Stadium , but that victory was the highlight of a season that saw the team finish bottom of the table and re @-@ apply for admission into the League of Ireland . 
 In 1976 , Meagan and Dunne resigned from the club and were replaced by Seán Thomas , the architect of the Six in a Row side , who with limited resources , re @-@ signed Johnny Fullam and Mick Leech , as well as John Conway from Bohemians . Rovers finished the 1976 – 77 season in eleventh but won the club ’ s only League of Ireland Cup , with Leech ’ s 250th career goal proving the difference against Sligo . In July 1977 , Irish international player @-@ manager John Giles returned to Dublin to take up the same role at Rovers . The Kilcoynes implemented a full @-@ time policy and unveiled plans to rebuild Glenmalure Park as a 50 @,@ 000 all @-@ seater stadium as well as turning the club into a school of excellence for Irish football , capable of challenging for European honours . Giles signed Irish internationals , Ray Treacy , Eamon Dunphy and Paddy Mulligan to complement the youth setup . In his first season in charge , the club won their 21st FAI Cup , defeating Sligo in a controversial final , but despite that success and emphatic victories in European competition against <unk> Nicosia and Fram Reykjavík , Giles ' conservative approach based on possession football proved unsuccessful and on 3 February 1983 , he resigned . 
 = = = Four in a row = = = 
 In the summer of 1983 , Jim McLaughlin replaced Noel Campbell as Rovers ' manager , after a successful period at Dundalk . Louis Kilcoyne made money available to McLaughlin who responded by selling and releasing almost the entire squad he had inherited from the Giles era , including fans ' favourite , Alan O 'Neill , while retaining the services of Liam Buckley , Harry Kenny , Alan Campbell and Peter Eccles . He brought in what was effectively a League of Ireland XI which included Jody Byrne and Noel King from Dundalk , Mick Neville from Drogheda , the trio of Eviston , Brady and O 'Brien from Bohemians , and Anto Whelan and Neville Steedman from Manchester United and <unk> Town . On 1 April 1984 , the club clinched their first League of Ireland title in 20 years with a 3 – 1 defeat of Shelbourne and 14 days later against Limerick at Glenmalure Park , midfielder and captain , Pat Byrne was presented with the trophy . Following that success , the club 's two star strikers , Campbell and Buckley , were transferred to Racing de Santander and <unk> <unk> . McLaughlin replaced them with Mick Byrne and Noel Larkin and the pairing proved successful as the club proceeded to win a further three League titles and three FAI Cups , with Byrne finishing the final season of the Four in a Row period as the League 's top goalscorer . Dermot Keely managed and played for the club that year after McLaughlin 's decision to transfer to Derry City [ 1 ] The Hoops won 74 League games out of 100 from August 1983 to April 1987 , losing only 11 .

 Shortly after winning their 14th League title , Louis Kilcoyne announced that the Kilcoynes were selling Glenmalure Park , which they had recently purchased from the Jesuits . The team played the entire 1987 – 88 season in an almost empty Tolka Park as a result of a boycott called for by the Shamrock Rovers Supporters Club and KRAM ( Keep Rovers At Milltown ) , which was observed by the vast majority of Hoops fans . Following the completion of the boycott season in Tolka , the Kilcoynes sold the football club to Dublin businessman John McNamara , who put forward a controversial proposal to move in with Bohemians at Dalymount Park . KRAM congregated to vote on whether to lift the boycott and on the proposal to move to Dalymount . Both motions were passed and the club spent the next two seasons at the <unk> venue , with an unrecognisable side playing in front of small attendances . 
 As the 1989 – 90 season concluded , the club announced that they were moving to the RDS in Ballsbridge , located halfway between Ringsend and Milltown on the Southside of Dublin . On 30 September 1990 , the RDS played host to Shamrock Rovers against St. Patrick 's Athletic , in front of 22 @,@ 000 people [ 2 ] . The fixture started a six @-@ year period at the venue that included a League title winning season in 1993 – 94 . Ray Treacy managed the League winning side which included Paul <unk> , Gino Brazil , John Toal , Alan Byrne and Stephen Geoghegan , who ended the season as top goalscorer . The next season , a number of key players were released as Treacy and McNamara enforced a tight budget and opted to rebuild the side with young players . The team began the season with a heavy defeat to Górnik Zabrze in the UEFA Cup and struggled their way to a midtable standing . They started the 1995 – 96 season badly and by late that season , after almost two years of growing supporter discontent at the running of the club , Treacy resigned , with McNamara following him shortly afterward . One of McNamara 's final acts was to appoint Alan O 'Neill and Terry Eviston , who had both returned to the club in 1993 , as joint managers of the side . They succeeded in removing the threat of relegation and almost guided the team to European qualification . 
 = = = = Long road to Tallaght = = = = 
 As the 1995 – 96 season concluded , John McNamara sold the club to Premier Computers , headed by Alan McGrath . McGrath unveiled a plan to build a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art stadium in the Dublin southwest suburb of Tallaght , and employed Pat Byrne as commercial manager . However , after a couple of weeks and a loss in the first game of the season , O ’ Neill was dismissed , while Eviston resigned in solidarity . Byrne was appointed manager of the side playing in Tolka Park once again , and they struggled through the season with the League 's joint top scorer , Tony Cousins playing a leading role in avoiding relegation . In May 1997 , Alan McGrath resigned as club chairman and was replaced by Brian Kearney , also of Premier Computers , who succeeded in acquiring planning permission for the new stadium in January 1998 . However , the permission was delayed by objections until November 1998 , by which time Joe Colwell had replaced Kearney as chairman and ended Premier Computers ' involvement with the club . On the pitch , Mick Byrne guided Rovers to an Intertoto Cup spot in 1997 – 98 and an eighth @-@ place finish , the next season . He was replaced by Damien Richardson , who managed the club during their stay at Morton Stadium before his dismissal in April 2002 , after a disagreement with Colwell . By that time , a half @-@ built shell of a stadium stood at the Tallaght site ; Mulden International Ltd , recruited by Colwell to complete the project , had pulled out of building the stadium . They leased it to a separate company , transferring the responsibility , and focused on four acres that they had retained for themselves . 
 = = = = <unk> and survival = = = = 
 Tony Maguire replaced Colwell as chairman and began the search for potential investors . In his first season as manager , Liam Buckley guided the club to the FAI Cup final and European qualification , as the team played at Richmond Park . The 2003 season was marked by the club 's worsening finances as a deal with potential investor , Conor Clarkson was held up by Mulden 's reluctance to sell their land . Having successfully applied for a one @-@ year planning extension in October 2003 , the club applied for a further extension a few months after Buckley 's departure in September 2004 . <unk> refused the application , but clarified their position by confirming their intention to build the stadium in partnership with the club , once the issue of ownership had been resolved . The trustees of the 400 Club ( supporters group ) informed the board of directors that they were no longer willing to bankroll their ownership of Shamrock Rovers . 
 Faced with the choice of remaining with Clarkson , whose plans were nullified by <unk> 's decision , or cooperating with the council , Maguire chose the former and with Mulden 's financing , initiated a High Court judicial review of the decision . The review failed and on 11 April 2005 , facing debts of over two million Euro , the club entered into examinership . The 400 Club agreed to completely bankroll the club during the process . On 5 May 2005 , Tony Maguire resigned on request by the FAI , who had discovered that the club had submitted their 2003 accounts in their application for a licence for the 2005 season . This resulted in a points deduction and subsequent relegation under Roddy Collins . The examinership concluded in July 2005 with the examiner accepting the 400 Club 's bid for Shamrock Rovers , saving the club from extinction , and the supporters @-@ owned club won promotion at the first attempt in 2006 under Pat Scully . The 2007 and 2008 seasons at Tolka Park were ones of overachievement and stability , but the major event of the period was the recommencement of building on the stadium after more than two years of legal disputes between the council and Thomas Davis CLG .

 The 2009 season proved to be a progressive one for the club , starting with the completion of the stadium and ending with a second @-@ place finish and qualification to the Europa League under the management of Michael O 'Neill . Tallaght Stadium hosted the highest attendances in the League of Ireland , regularly selling out its capacity . The season was also marked by the visit of Real Madrid to Tallaght Stadium , where they defeated The Hoops 1 – 0 in front of a record attendance of 10 @,@ 900 people . The team entered the 2010 – 11 Europa League in the second qualifying round and defeated Bnei Yehuda of Israel to progress to a third qualifying round tie against Juventus . The Italian side won the tie 3 – 0 on aggregate . Shamrock Rovers finished the 2010 season as champions , ending a 16 @-@ year drought by narrowly beating Bohemians to the title on goal difference .

 In 2011 the club played its first ever Champions League game and its first game in the highest level of European Cup Competition 's since the 1987 – 88 European Cup , beating Estonian Champions Flora Tallinn in the 2011 – 12 Champions League Second qualifying round . They accomplished this feat by triumphing 1 – 0 in the first leg at Tallaght Stadium and drawing 0 – 0 in the second leg in Estonia to advance 1 – 0 on aggregate . Rovers were then beaten 3 – 0 on aggregate in the next round by Danish Champions Copenhagen but advanced to the 2011 – 12 Europa League Play @-@ off round . There they were drawn against Serbian Champions FK Partizan , whom they defeated 3 – 2 on aggregate ( 2 – 1 on the night after extra time ) to reach the group stages of the Europa League .

Rovers also won the All Ireland Setanta Sports Cup in 2011 by defeating Dundalk in the final at Tallaght <unk> wrapped up a second league title in a row with a last @-@ minute victory over UCD at Belfield on 25 October 2011 . 
 = = Colours and badge = = 
 Until 1926 , Shamrock Rovers wore green and white striped jerseys but following a suggestion by a committee member , John Sheridan , the club chose to adopt the green and white hooped strip . A close relationship existed between the club and Belfast Celtic and it was on account of this that the idea was formed . The first game featuring the new jerseys was against Bray Unknowns in a FAI Cup match on 9 January 1927 at Shelbourne Park . The Hoops lost the game 3 – 0 and senior members of the club considered abandoning the new strip . Despite this loss , the team continued to wear green and white hoops and have done ever since . The 2007 season was the first season since the hoops were introduced that they were not continuous around the main body of the jersey . The style of the shirt sleeves has been changed on numerous occasions . The away colours of the club have varied over time . In the early 1980s , the club had a yellow away jersey . In the mid @-@ 1990s , a hooped purple jersey was adopted . In 2011 , the team wore an all black away strip . 
 The club emblem features a football and a shamrock , and has done so throughout the history of the club . Minor alterations to the club badge have included changing the style of the shamrock and the width of the diagonal lines . In 2005 , a star was added above the badge to signify the first 10 League of Ireland titles won by the club . After the takeover of the club by the supporters , black became the club 's third official colour in recognition of the loss of Glenmalure Park . It was also decided that the number 12 would no longer be worn by any Shamrock Rovers player and instead would represent the club 's supporters .

 = = = Glenmalure Park = = = 
 On 11 September 1926 , Shamrock Rovers played their first game at Glenmalure Park , Milltown against Dundalk , having previously played at Ringsend Park , Shelbourne Park , Windy Arbour and a different pitch behind the famous Milltown one . The official opening took place on Sunday , 19 September 1926 as Belfast Celtic provided the opposition in an exhibition game . When the Cunninghams acquired the club in the 1930s , the stadium was named Glenmalure Park in honour of their ancestral home in Glenmalure . They completed the stadium with the addition of terraces , one of which was covered . The stadium remained essentially unaltered from then until its demolition in 1990 , excluding the destruction of a small terrace and the erection of floodlights in the 1980s . Its capacity was approximately 20 @,@ 000 for most of its existence , its largest recorded attendance being 28 @,@ 000 , set against Waterford in 1968 . Larger , unreported , attendances were present at the venue before then . 
 In 1987 , the Kilcoynes decided to sell the stadium to property developers , having recently purchased it from the Jesuits . The last game at Glenmalure Park was an FAI Cup semi @-@ final between Shamrock Rovers and Sligo Rovers on 12 April 1987 . The game saw a pitch invasion by supporters protesting against the sale of the stadium . The next season , the supporters formed an association called Keep Rovers at Milltown and placed a picket on home games at Tolka Park , effectively bankrupting the club 's owners . They accumulated funds , through supporter contributions , in an effort to purchase the stadium but failed to match the offer of a property developer to whom the Kilcoynes eventually sold the site . After a lengthy appeals process , Glenmalure Park was demolished in 1990 to be replaced by an apartment complex . 
 = = = Tallaght Stadium = = = 
 In the 1990s , Shamrock Rovers were granted land in the Dublin suburb of Tallaght to build a new stadium . On 30 March 2000 , Taoiseach Bertie Ahern turned the sod at the site . However , work on the stadium ceased in 2001 and in March 2005 , South Dublin County Council announced that they were taking back the land that they had granted to the club , as the conditions of the planning permission had not been met . A public consultation process was initiated in July 2005 and a resolution was passed in December 2005 to alter the stadium to accommodate senior GAA games while still having Shamrock Rovers as the preferred tenants . This decision was subject to additional government funding . This funding was not made available and on 13 January 2006 the council voted to proceed with the original plan . 
 This second vote was challenged by a local Gaelic Athletic Association club , Thomas Davis who wanted the vote on 13 January 2006 declared illegal thus forcing the county council to build the GAA stadium . Thomas Davis claimed that the capacity of the stadium ( initially 6 @,@ 000 , ultimately 10 @,@ 000 ) would not be affected by the change , the other parties involved disputed this and argued that the capacity would be reduced . Requests under the freedom of information act to both South Dublin County Council and the Department of Sport showed that Thomas Davis had not submitted any plans showing that capacity would not be affected . 
 Thomas Davis GAA club instituted judicial review proceedings in the High Court in May 2006 . Their main argument was that the decision of the council on 13 February 2006 to revert to the original plans for the stadium , which did not include a senior GAA pitch , was unlawful . Their submission on the technical point was accompanied by cultural arguments that ' the youth of Tallaght will be restricted to a diet of Association football ' and that a soccer @-@ only ground would place the ' applicant at a severe disadvantage in attracting the youth of Tallaght to the club , the sport and the GAA culture . The stadium , however , with the original design , could accommodate junior GAA games as the pitch used at this level fits within the stadium 's dimensions . It was only senior GAA games that would not have been facilitated . 
 The then Minister for Arts , Sport and Tourism , John O 'Donoghue , consistently supported the government decision to support the stadium with soccer pitch dimensions , and claimed that the GAA were stalling the project which he believed they had no need for on top of their own site in <unk> . On 14 December 2006 the Football Association of Ireland pledged financial assistance for the Hoops ’ High Court battle involving Thomas Davis . 
 The judicial review began on 20 April 2007 and concluded on 14 December 2007 . In the High Court decision Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy found in favour of South Dublin Co . Council and Shamrock Rovers . South Dublin County Council were correct in their 13 February 2006 vote to proceed with the stadium as originally planned . An application by Thomas Davis for leave to appeal this decision to the Supreme court was refused by Judge Murphy on 25 January 2008 . Building commenced on the stadium on 6 May 2008 . Shamrock Rovers played their first ' home ' game in over 20 years in the stadium in March 2009 . 
 = = Ownership = = 
 Shamrock Rovers F.C. is a members ' club owned by the Shamrock Rovers Members Club . The Shamrock Rovers Members Club was originally formed as the 400 Club in November 2002 , by the then privately owned football club 's board of directors , to raise funds through the fan base , with the sole purpose of facilitating a mortgage for the development of the stalled stadium project in Tallaght . The monthly membership fee was set at € 40 . However , it became apparent to the members that the funds raised were being used for purposes outside of the stated objective . As a result , the membership took control of the 400 Club , adopted a transparent structure and constitution , and declared itself totally independent of the then board of Shamrock Rovers . The 400 Club consortium played a crucial role in the survival of Shamrock Rovers when the club entered examinership in April 2005 . They paid off a portion of the club 's debts and assumed responsibility for running it . After the successful acquisition of the club through the examinership process , the 400 Club Trustees became the Board of Directors of Shamrock Rovers Football Club and began the process of building a sustainable club through sensible business practices . Numerous clubs and supporters groups subsequently sought their advice with regard to using the model of the 400 club elsewhere . At the annual meeting of the 400 Club in 2006 , the members voted to rename it as the SRFC Members Club , reflecting the reality of their ownership of the football club . At the 2008 meeting , the monthly membership fee was increased to € 50 . In January 2012 , there were more than 400 members of the club . Membership is open to all . 
 = = Supporters and rivalries = = 
 The majority of Shamrock Rovers supporters originate from the Southside of Dublin , but the club attracts fans from across the city and country . Since its foundation , the club has maintained a proud Irish identity , and their supporters reflect this in the flags and banners they display . Their support base contains a number of clubs dedicated to supporting the team at away games . It also contains an ultras group , which was the first formed in Ireland , the SRFC Ultras , who produce choreographed displays of support at games . They have connections with other European groups including supporters of Roma , Hammarby and Panathinaikos . 
 Until the 1970s , Glenmalure Park regularly hosted attendances in the region of 20 @,@ 000 people , but as the majority of the Irish public turned its back on Irish football , those numbers declined and despite winning the League of Ireland four times in succession in the 1980s , the attendances for the period averaged approximately a quarter of that figure . The sale of the stadium contributed to a further decline in support . During the homeless years , particularly those spent on the Northside , attendances continued to fall with the exception of those recorded during the club 's residence at the RDS , which included an opening attendance of 22 @,@ 000 . Prior to the relocation to Tallaght , the club 's support base had been reduced to a hardcore group of over a thousand people . It currently includes approximately 2 @,@ 700 season ticket holders . 
 Throughout their history , Shamrock Rovers have shared many rivalries of differing importance and intensity . The oldest such rivalry is that shared with Shelbourne , formed on the basis of the clubs ' foundations in Ringsend . It remains as a secondary rivalry of similar importance to the local derby contested with St. Patrick 's Athletic . During the 1950s and 1960s , the club 's principal rival was , the now defunct , Drumcondra . In the 1970s , they were replaced as the major club on the Northside by Bohemians . Since then , the relatively minor rivalry that existed between Shamrock Rovers and Bohemians has developed into a classic rivalry , producing intense games and large attendances .

 The schoolboys sections of Shamrock Rovers and Tallaght Town merged in 1997 to form a new section to serve the Tallaght area of South West Dublin . Tallaght Town initially remained in operation with three intermediate teams participating in the Leinster Senior League . Two of these teams continue to compete , but under the name of Shamrock Rovers . Tallaght Town exists as a limited company and as trustee of a training facility used by the youth teams at Shamrock Rovers . There are sixteen of these teams , composed of over 200 players and 35 managers and coaches . They cater for players in the six to nineteen years of age group . The club 's youth teams have participated in the Milk Cup and Dallas Cup . The club operates scholarships covering all levels of education . In conjunction with IT Tallaght , they offer third level education to players and have introduced a scholarship scheme that facilitates primary school students through the Junior Certificate cycle .

 The Elder Scrolls IV : Shivering Isles is the second expansion pack for the role @-@ playing video game The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion . Announced on January 18 , 2007 , the expansion was developed , published , and released over the Xbox Live Marketplace by Bethesda Softworks ; its retail release was co @-@ published with 2K Games . It was released for Microsoft Windows in a boxed retail edition on March 26 , 2007 , while the Xbox 360 version was released digitally on the Xbox Live Marketplace . Shivering Isles takes place on the eponymous isles ruled by the Daedric Prince of Madness , Sheogorath . The player becomes Sheogorath 's protégé , and together they try to defeat the Daedric Lord of Order , Jyggalag , thus preventing the isles from being destroyed ; this main quest can be ignored for as long as the player wishes to interact with the new world . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Shivering Isles is identical to the basic gameplay of The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion ; the basic design , maneuvers , and interfaces remain unchanged . As such , it is a fantasy @-@ based role @-@ playing adventure game . Players begin Oblivion by defining their character , deciding on its skill set , specialization , physical features , and race . The player gains experience points through the practice of specific skills , such as gaining archery experience by practicing archery . This goes against standard role @-@ playing game form , where any skill use garners generic experience points that may be put towards any type of specialization . Enemies increase in difficulty as players strengthen their skills , scaling the game 's challenge to the players ' strength . 
 As with the original game , The Shivering Isles is an open @-@ ended expansion . The main quest may be delayed or completely ignored as the player explores the game world , follows side quests , interacts with non @-@ player characters , and develops a character according to their taste . Once the game is updated the player can access the extra content at any time with any character . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The expansion pack takes place on the Shivering Isles , ruled by the Daedric Prince of Madness , Sheogorath . The realm is divided into two sections , Mania and Dementia , both of which have different characteristics in the art and design . The player enters the realm as an event called the Greymarch is about to occur - in which the Daedric Prince of Order , Jyggalag , completely destroys the Shivering Isles . Upon entering the realm , the player has access to only one area of the Shivering Isles , called the Fringe . To gain access to the other areas , the player must defeat a creature called the Gatekeeper . Before entering the other areas , the player is summoned for an audience with the mad god Sheogorath . Sheogorath explains to the player that the Greymarch will destroy the realm , and Sheogorath needs a " champion " to stop the event from occurring . Sheogorath decides to choose the player as his protégé , whom he sends off on various quests in an attempt to stop the Greymarch . 
 Sheogorath 's and the player 's attempts to stop the Greymarch ultimately fail . Sheogorath then transforms into Jyggalag , by then revealed to be his alter @-@ ego , and disappears . As the player defends the Court of Madness from the ensuing invasion of the forces of Order , Jyggalag himself appears and attacks the player . The player defeats Jyggalag , and the Greymarch stops . Jyggalag then explains to the player that , when the Daedric Princes were creating their own lands , his power and the rapid expansion of his realm caused the other princes to become fearful and jealous , prompting them to curse him with madness , changing him into Sheogorath , the Prince of Madness . Since Daedra are subject to a reincarnation cycle , Jyggalag / Sheogorath was doomed to relive the Greymarch at the end of each era , after which Jyggalag would once again be transformed into Sheogorath . After explaining this history , Jyggalag thanks the player for breaking the cycle and dubs him / her the " new " Sheogorath , Prince of Madness and ruler of the Shivering Isles .

 The earliest news about Shivering Isles surfaced on January 4 , 2007 when an issue of PC Zone revealed the expansion . The issue revealed details about the plot and setting of the expansion , published its first screenshots and announced its expected arrival in the second quarter of 2007 . Bethesda did not announce the expansion until January 18 , 2007 . The announcement came after the expansion had already been featured in both PC Zone and PC Gamer , after it had been scheduled for a February 6 , 2007 appearance in Games for Windows , and after it had been reported in several online publications . The official announcement also confirmed an eventual release for the Xbox 360 , something the magazines , being PC publications , had not previously mentioned . 
 Further clarification came in early March when Executive Producer Todd Howard revealed the specific release date of March 27 , 2007 , but due to unscheduled maintenance , it was released on Xbox Live a day early . A disc version of Shivering Isles was announced on September 6 , 2007 with a previously disallowed hard drive requirement . The expansion was released as a standalone for the PlayStation 3 version of the game on November 20 , 2007 and as a download from the PlayStation Network on November 29 , 2007 . The expansion was made available for download to Australian customers only on November 23 , 2007 . Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine expansions shipped together in the packaged release of Oblivion 's Game of the Year edition . 
 = = = Concept art = = = 
 Much of the distinctive look of Shivering Isles is credited to concept artist Adam Adamowicz ( 1968 @-@ 2012 ) . The landscape of the Isles is divided into two main areas : Mania and Dementia . The land of Mania is characterized by vivid colour and fantastical flora , while Dementia is filled with bogs and <unk> twisted trees and roots . Adamowicz had a major influence on the style of other Bethesda Softworks game titles such as Fallout 3 and The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim . The portal to the Shivering Isles was also designed by Adamowicz , and bears his signature style . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The Shivering Isles was generally well received in the gaming press . Aggregate sites Metacritic and Game Rankings scored both the PC version and the Xbox 360 version of the game at 86 out of 100 . 
 Greg Mueller from GameSpot recommends the game for its value but sees it as " not an absolutely essential expansion " and rates some of the later quests as repetitive and uninspired . Similar comments followed from GamePro reviewer Newton , who found that it is " an impressive expansion " which " delivers more of what made Oblivion great : creative quests , a huge land to explore , and tons of things to do there , [ therefore ] making this expansion is a solid purchase for anyone who was a fan of the core game " . Jim Rossignol from Eurogamer initially rated the game as equally memorable to Oblivion but later saying that it is " the same game as it ever was , only this time with a slightly weirder backdrop , and less interesting questing " . Charles Onyett from IGN rates it as " an entirely worthy addition to Bethesda 's stellar fourth entry in The Elder Scrolls series " and as " a great excuse to jump back in [ the series ] " . 
 The expansion received accolades from several media publishers , including " Best RPG " at the 2008 Game of the Year Awards offered by Game Industry News , the " Best Expansion " at the 2007 Game of the Year Awards offered by Vodoo Extreme , as well as those offered by <unk> , and " Best Downloadable Content " at the G @-@ Phoria 2007 Awards . It also received the " Editor 's Choice Award " from Team Xbox , Game Pro , and IGN , as well as the " Top Pick Award " by Game Vortex , and the " Silver Award " from Advanced Media Network .

 Johnson described T. C. ' s later character development as " disappointing " by limiting him to " the angry black man " stereotype . He initially praised the show for its racially diverse cast and representation of African @-@ American characters , but later felt his character and the other African @-@ American roles were not used to their full potential . T. C. ' s relationship with Eve and Johnson 's chemistry with Ross received negative feedback , with a majority of the show 's promotional images advertising Eve and Julian as a supercouple instead .

An article in Jet later commented that each member of the Russell family was designed to be " an integral part of the show " in attempt to avoid token characters . Johnson frequently praised the show 's representation of African @-@ American characters in interviews and identified it as one of the primary reasons behind his attraction to the role : 
 We are the only daytime drama with a full African @-@ American family . The Russells have a key role in the community . There aren 't just a flash in the pan . The storylines are heavy . The show has received a huge response from the African @-@ American community for that reason . 
 Johnson said the chance to act with Tracey Ross also influenced his acceptance of the role . He called Ross the it girl for the African @-@ American community following her appearance on Star Search .

For several decades , he incorrectly believes Julian was responsible for the accident and he harbors a desire for revenge against the Crane family for destroying his future plans ; he later discovers Eve was the one to hit him while she was driving under the influence . Sometime in the 1970s , T. C. married doctor Eve Johnson and had two children with her . He pushed his oldest daughter Whitney to start training to be a professional tennis champion from an early age so he could live vicariously through her life ; he is not shown to pay too much attention to his youngest daughter Simone . T. C. is unaware of Eve 's past drug and alcohol abuse and her past relationship and child with Julian . 
 T. C. ' s early appearances concentrate on the mysterious contents of his secret shed , but it is later retconned that " there was nothing in the shed that was substantial . " From 2002 to 2004 , Eve 's adoptive sister attempts to expose Eve 's past to T. C. and coerce him into having sex with her . Her actions escalate to the point where she slips T. C. a mickey for Eve to catch him in the act of adultery . The storyline culminates in July 2004 when Liz brings Eve 's aunt Irma Johnson to tell T. C. the truth about Eve 's past relationship with Julian and their child and her involvement in the car accident ending T. C. ' s tennis career . T. C. responds to the new by almost killing Julian in a violent rage and later divorcing Eve ; he briefly has a romantic relationship and engagement with Liz . Everyone in Harmony incorrectly assumes that Eve 's child with Julian is Chad ; Whitney 's relationship with Chad is believed to be incestuous as they would be half @-@ siblings . The possibility of incest further fractures the family . T. C. grows increasingly jealous and angry when Eve renews her relationship with Julian . T. C. falls into a deep depression coupled with alcoholism and physically assaults Simone after she comes out as a lesbian . 
 Rodney Van Johnson points to the earthquake and tsunami in the show 's 2005 summertime extravaganza as " the turning point " in which " T. C. realizes that he wants to be back with his wife . " Following the natural disasters , T. C. breaks off his engagement with Liz after reconciling with his ex @-@ wife 's past and rebukes all of her efforts to seduce her way back into his life . Before he can fully make amends with his ex @-@ wife and family , he gets injured in an automobile accident while driving under the influence and suffers from a stroke . During his recovery , T. C. grows closer to his ex @-@ wife and apologizes to Simone for his homophobic and abusive behavior . He was last shown babysitting Whitney and Chad 's son and his grandson Miles Davis Crane @-@ Harris ; following the show 's transition from NBC to DirecTV , he is said to have moved to New Orleans to help and reconnect with his daughters . He does not physically appear during the show 's run on DirecTV or the series finale .

 Despite his original positive response to the show , Johnson later expressed disappointment at his role shortly before his exit . He identified the decision to start " taking out the people of color " , like Amelia Marshall , Brook Kerr , and himself , as an obvious sign that " this thing is going down " . He said his character was not properly used and that he was frequently defaulted to " the angry black man . " He negatively compared T. C. to his previous role as Trey Stark on The Young and the Restless , saying that " I was used well " as Trey . Johnson also said the character gave him a negative stigma that limited his future opportunities for auditions . 
 In comparison to fan 's positive reception of Eve and Julian 's relationship ( dubbed " Evian " ) , T. C. ' s relationship with Eve and Johnson 's chemistry with Ross did not receive much attention from the fans and media . Other Passions cast members and representatives commented on the preference for Julian over T. C. ; Masters said his character Julian should " just kick T. C. out of his house " and beat him with a 4x4 and a spokesperson from the show pushed Julian and Eve 's romance to the forefront as " a new supercouple in Harmony " without any mention of T. C. 
 Internationally , T. C. received a more positive response . African newspaper <unk> said Johnson was invited to the 2005 Miss Culture and Heritage contest in Botswana due to his performance of T. C. as a " husband and father in the soap that warms the hearts of many in different countries " . 
 = Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories = 
 The Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories consisted of the military occupation , then annexation , of the Bačka , Baranja , Međimurje and Prekmurje regions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by the Kingdom of Hungary during World War II . These territories had all been under Hungarian rule prior to 1920 , and had been transferred to Yugoslavia as part of the post @-@ World War I Treaty of Trianon . They now form part of several states : Yugoslav Bačka is now part of Vojvodina , an autonomous province of Serbia , Yugoslav Baranja and Međimurje are part of modern @-@ day Croatia , and Yugoslav Prekmurje is part of modern @-@ day Slovenia . The occupation began on 11 April 1941 when 80 @,@ 000 Hungarian troops crossed the Yugoslav border in support of the German @-@ led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia that had commenced five days earlier . There was some resistance to the Hungarian forces from Serb Chetnik irregulars , but the defences of the Royal Yugoslav Army had collapsed by this time . The Hungarian forces were indirectly aided by the local Volksdeutsche , the German minority , which had formed a militia and disarmed around 90 @,@ 000 Yugoslav troops . Despite only sporadic resistance , Hungarian troops killed many civilians during these initial operations , including some Volksdeutsche . The government of the newly formed Axis puppet state , the Independent State of Croatia , subsequently consented to the Hungarian annexation of the Međimurje area , which dismayed the Croat population of the region . 
 The occupation authorities immediately classified the population of Bačka and Baranja into those that had lived in those regions when they had last been under Hungarian rule in 1920 and the mostly Serb settlers who had arrived since the areas had been part of Yugoslavia . They then began herding thousands of local Serbs into concentration camps and expelled them to the Independent State of Croatia , Italian @-@ occupied Montenegro , and the German @-@ occupied territory of Serbia . Ultimately , tens of thousands of Serbs were deported from the occupied territories . This was followed by the implementation of a policy of " <unk> " of the political , social and economic life of the occupied territories , which included the re @-@ settlement of Hungarians and Székelys from other parts of Hungary . " Magyarisation " did not impact the Volksdeutsche , who received special status under Hungarian rule , and in Prekmurje the Hungarian authorities were more permissive towards ethnic Slovenes . 
 Small @-@ scale armed resistance to the Hungarian occupation commenced in the latter half of 1941 and was answered with harsh measures , including summary executions , expulsions and internment . The insurgency was mainly concentrated in the ethnic @-@ Serb area of southern Bačka in the <unk> region , where Hungarian forces avenged their losses . In August 1941 a civilian administration took over the government of the " Recovered Southern Territories " ( Hungarian : <unk> ) , and they were formally annexed to Hungary in December . In January 1942 the Hungarian military conducted raids during which they killed over 3 @,@ 300 people , mostly Serbs and Jews . 
 In March 1944 , when Hungary realised that it was on the losing side in the war and began to negotiate with the Allies , Germany took control of the country , including the annexed territories , during Operation Margarethe I. This was followed by the collection and transport of the remaining Jews in the occupied territories to extermination camps , resulting in the deaths of 85 per cent of the Jews in the occupied territories . Prior to their withdrawal from the Balkans in the face of the advance of the Soviet Red Army , the Germans evacuated 60 @,@ 000 – 70 @,@ 000 Volksdeutsche from Bačka and Baranja to Austria . Bačka and Baranja were restored to Yugoslav control when the Germans were pushed out of the region by the Red Army in late 1944 . Međimurje and Prekmurje remained occupied until the last weeks of the war . 
 = = Background = = 
 At the Paris Peace Conference following the conclusion of World War I , the Entente Powers signed the Treaty of Trianon with Hungary after the breakup of Austria @-@ Hungary . Among other things , the treaty defined the border between Hungary and the newly created Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( KSCS , renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929 ) . It divided the previously Hungarian @-@ ruled regions of Banat , Bačka and Baranja between Hungary , the KSCS , and Romania , and transferred the Međimurje region and about two thirds of the Prekmurje region from Hungary to the KSCS . Sizable numbers of Hungarians and Volksdeutsche remained in the areas incorporated into the KSCS . Between 1918 and 1924 , 44 @,@ 903 Hungarians ( including 8 @,@ 511 government employees ) were deported to Hungary from the territories transferred to Yugoslavia , and approximately 10 @,@ 000 Yugoslav military settlers ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> <unk> , lit . Salonika volunteers ) , mainly Serbs , were settled in Bačka and Baranja by the Yugoslav government . During the interwar period Hungary agitated for a revision of the borders agreed in the Treaty of Trianon , and relations between the two countries were difficult . On 22 August 1938 , Czechoslovakia , Romania and Yugoslavia agreed to a revision of Trianon that allowed Hungary to re @-@ arm itself . 
 = = = Demographics = = = 
 Prior to the occupation , the most recent Yugoslav census had been taken in 1931 . This census used language as the primary criterion , and counted all speakers of Serbo @-@ Croatian as one group , rather than recognising distinct Serb , Croat , Bosnian Muslim , Macedonian and Montenegrin nationalities . Aligning data on religious affiliation with the linguistic data has been used by scholars to determine approximate numbers of Serbs and Croats in the 1931 census , by counting those of the Roman Catholic denomination as Croats . 
 According to the 1931 census , the territories of Bačka and Baranja had a combined population of 837 @,@ 742 . This included between 275 @,@ 014 and 283 @,@ 114 Hungarians , and between 185 @,@ 458 and 194 @,@ 908 Volksdeutsche . Hungarians therefore made up around one @-@ third of the population of these territories , with the Volksdeutsche comprising slightly less than one @-@ quarter . According to the historian Dr. <unk> <unk> , the 1931 census showed that the population of Bačka and Baranja included 150 @,@ 301 Serbs and 3 @,@ 099 Croats . This corresponds to a Serb population of about 18 per cent . These figures vary considerably from the combined Serb and Croat population of 305 @,@ 917 provided by Professor Jozo Tomasevich , corresponding to 36 @.@ 5 per cent of the population . The 1931 census figures for Međimurje and Prekmurje show a total population of 193 @,@ 640 , of which 101 @,@ 467 ( 52 @.@ 2 per cent ) were Croats , 75 @,@ 064 ( 38 @.@ 7 per cent ) were Slovenes , and 15 @,@ 308 ( 8 per cent ) were Hungarians .

 Between 1938 and 1940 , following German – Italian mediation in the First and Second Vienna Awards , and the Hungarian invasion of Carpatho @-@ Ukraine , Hungary enlarged its territory . It absorbed parts of southern Czechoslovakia , Carpathian Ruthenia and the northern part of Transylvania , which the Kingdom of Romania ceded . One of the ethno @-@ cultural areas that changed hands between Romania and Hungary at this time was the Székely Land . The support that Hungary received from Germany for these border revisions meant that the relationship between the two countries became even closer . On 20 November 1940 , Hungary formally joined the Axis Tripartite Pact . On 12 December 1940 , at the initiative of the Prime Minister , Count Pál Teleki , Hungary concluded a friendship and non @-@ aggression treaty with Yugoslavia . Although the concept had received support from both Germany and Italy , the actual signing of the treaty did not , as Germany 's planned invasion of Greece would be simplified if Yugoslavia could be neutralised . After the Yugoslav military coup of 27 March 1941 , when the Germans asked the Hungarian Regent , Admiral Miklós Horthy , for clearance to launch one of their armoured thrusts using Hungarian territory , Teleki was unable to dissuade the Regent . Concluding that Hungary had disgraced itself irrevocably by siding with the Germans against the Yugoslavs , Teleki shot himself . Horthy informed Hitler that evening that Hungary would abide by the friendship treaty with Yugoslavia , though it would likely cease to apply should Croatia secede and Yugoslavia cease to exist . 
 = = Invasion = = 
 On 10 April 1941 , the Independent State of Croatia ( Croatian : Nezavisna Država Hrvatska , NDH ) was established in Zagreb by the Ustaše . That day Horthy and the new Prime Minister of Hungary László <unk> issued a joint declaration that Yugoslavia had ceased to exist , releasing Hungary from its obligations under the non @-@ aggression pact and the Treaty of Trianon . According to the declaration Hungarian troops would act to " protect the Hungarians who live in the south parts from the anarchy " of the April War which had begun there several days earlier when Italian and German troops invaded . The following day the Hungarian 3rd Army began occupying those regions of Yugoslavia using the Mobile , IV and V Corps , with I and VII Corps in reserve . That day ( 11 April ) , the headquarters of the 3rd Army informed that of the German 2nd Army that Hungarian forces had crossed the frontier north of Osijek and near Subotica . 
 The German army 's rapid manoeuvres during the invasion had forced the tactical withdrawal of Yugoslav forces facing Hungarian army units and there was no significant fighting between the two armies . The Hungarian forces advanced south to the Danube between Vukovar and the confluence with the Tisza without any real military resistance . Serb Chetnik irregulars fought isolated engagements , and the Hungarian General Staff considered irregular resistance forces to be their only significant opposition . 
 On 12 April , the Hungarian 1st Parachute Battalion captured canal bridges at Vrbas and Srbobran . Meanwhile , Sombor was captured against determined Chetnik resistance , and Subotica was also captured . This , the first airborne operation in Hungarian history , was not without incident . The battalion 's aircraft consisted of five Italian @-@ made Savoia @-@ Marchetti SM.75 transport aircraft formerly with the civilian airline MALERT , but pressed into service with the Royal Hungarian Air Force ( Hungarian : Magyar Királyi Honvéd Légierő , MKHL ) at the start of the European war . Shortly after takeoff from the airport at Veszprém @-@ Jutas on the afternoon of 12 April , the command plane , code E @-@ 101 , crashed with the loss of 20 or 23 lives , including 19 paratroopers . This was the heaviest single loss suffered by the Hungarians during the Yugoslav campaign . 
 On 13 April , the 1st and 2nd Motorized Brigades occupied Novi Sad , then pushed south across the Danube into the northern part of Croatian Syrmia capturing Vinkovci and Vukovar on 18 April . These brigades then drove southeast to capture the western Serbian town of Valjevo a day later . Other Hungarian forces occupied the Yugoslavian regions of Prekmurje and Međimurje . A later American assessment concluded that German forces had to take the brunt of the fighting , observing that Hungarian forces had " displayed great reluctance to attack until the enemy had been soundly beaten and thoroughly disorganized by the Germans . " When a Yugoslav delegation signed an armistice with German and Italian representatives at Belgrade on 17 April , the Hungarians were represented by a liaison officer , but he did not sign the document because Hungary was " not at war with Yugoslavia . " The armistice came into effect at noon the next day . News of the success of the Hungarian armed forces in Yugoslavia was welcomed in the Hungarian Parliament . German forces occupied a narrow slice of northeastern Prekmurje along the German – Yugoslav border , which included four Volksdeutsche villages . In mid @-@ June 1941 , this area was absorbed into Reichsgau Steiermark . 
 Hungarian troops suffered 126 dead and 241 wounded during the sporadic fighting , and killed between 1 @,@ 122 and 3 @,@ 500 civilians , including some Volksdeutsche . Many civilians were arrested and tortured . On 14 April 1941 , around 500 Jews and Serbs were bayoneted to death , probably as a warning to others not to resist . During post @-@ war questioning , Horthy insisted that he had not wished to invade Yugoslavia , but that he had been compelled to act by disorder and the massacre of Hungarians in Bačka , but these claims have been dismissed by Tomasevich . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The Hungarian @-@ occupied territory of Bačka consisted of that part of the Danube Banovina bounded by the former Hungarian – Yugoslav border to the north , the Danube to the south and west , and the Tisza to the west . The occupied territory of Baranja had also been part of the Danube Banovina , but was that area bounded by the former Hungarian @-@ Yugoslav border to the north and west , the Drava to the west and south , and the Danube to the west . The territory of Međimurje was part of the Banovina of Croatia prior to the invasion , and was bounded by the Mura river to the north and the Drava river to the south . Prekmurje consisted of that part of the pre @-@ war Drava Banovina that lay north of the Mura . Most of the Hungarian @-@ occupied territories consisted of flat , largely agricultural land of the Pannonian Plain , except for some hilly country in the northwest of the Međimurje region and in the north of the Prekmurje region . The total area of the Yugoslav territories occupied by Hungary was 11 @,@ 475 square kilometres ( 4 @,@ 431 sq mi ) , consisting of 8 @,@ 558 km2 ( 3 @,@ 304 sq mi ) in Bačka , 1 @,@ 213 km2 ( 468 sq mi ) in Baranja , and 1 @,@ 704 km2 ( 658 sq mi ) in the Međimurje and Prekmurje regions . 
 = = Administration = = 
 At first , the occupied territories were placed under military administration . The international legal scholar , Professor Raphael Lemkin , who coined the word " genocide " as meaning the " destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group " , described the policies implemented by the Hungarian authorities in the occupied territories as " genocidal " . Lemkin asserted that " genocidal " policies were those that were aimed at destroying the political , social , cultural , religious , and economic existence and language of those living in occupied territories . In the first two weeks of Hungarian rule , 10 @,@ 000 Serbs were expelled to the German @-@ occupied territory of Serbia , the NDH , or Italian @-@ ruled Montenegro . On 1 May 1941 , the Germans estimated that the population of the territories occupied by Hungary was 1 @,@ 145 @,@ 000 . On 9 July 1941 , the military governor of the town of Čakovec in Međimurje , Colonel Zsigmond <unk> , issued a declaration that the following day Međimurje was to be placed permanently under military administration and Hungarian rule . According to Professor Sabrina Ramet , the government of the NDH consented to Hungarian annexation of the Međimurje area on 10 July , but according to Davor Kovačić and Marica <unk> <unk> of the Croatian Institute of History , the Hungarian declaration was made without consulting with the NDH government , and was never recognised by it . The Croat population of the region were unhappy with the decision , and military rule remained in place until 16 August 1941 , after which civil administration was introduced . On 12 July , the Yugoslav dinar ceased to be legal tender in the occupied territories , and was replaced by the Hungarian <unk> . A census of the occupied Yugoslav territories was conducted by the Hungarian authorities in 1941 , which counted a total population of 1 @,@ 030 @,@ 027 . In this census , the ethnic proportions in these territories combined were 37 per cent Hungarian , 19 per cent Volksdeutsche , 18 per cent Croats and 16 per cent Serbs , and the population of Prekmurje was 102 @,@ 867 . 
 On 14 December , these regions , referred to by Hungary as the " Recovered Southern Territories " ( Hungarian : <unk> ) , were formally incorporated into Hungary and were given full representation in the Hungarian Parliament , although representatives were to be nominated by the Parliament rather than elected . Although plans to deport 150 @,@ 000 Serbs ( including colonists from the interwar period , but also native inhabitants ) to the German @-@ occupied territory of Serbia were opposed by the German command in Belgrade , the Hungarian occupational regime managed to expel between 25 @,@ 000 and 60 @,@ 000 of them , mostly to Serbia . During the war , the Hungarian government resettled some of its pre @-@ war population in Bačka and Baranja , primarily Székelys from areas of Transylvania ceded to Hungary by Romania in 1940 . Between 15 @,@ 000 and 18 @,@ 000 were reportedly resettled in Bačka and Baranja . 
 The Hungarian authorities established concentration camps for Serbs from which they were eventually expelled to the German @-@ occupied territory of Serbia . As part of the " systematic <unk> " of these territories , Hungarian political parties and patriotic organisations were encouraged to be active in Bačka and Baranja , which resulted in discrimination against " less @-@ desirable elements " of the population such as Serbs , Croats and Jews . Discrimination extended to education and communication , where Hungarian and German were the only languages permitted in almost all secondary schools , and books , newspapers and periodicals in the Serbo @-@ Croat language were virtually banned . Well @-@ educated Serbs and Croats were precluded from undertaking work commensurate with their education . Despite this , Serbs and Croats that had lived in the territories prior to 1918 retained their citizenship rights as Hungarians , and some lower @-@ level non @-@ Hungarian public employees were retained in their jobs . One former Serb senator and one former Croat parliamentary deputy sat in the Hungarian Parliament . In Prekmurje , the Hungarian authorities were more permissive , making no attempt to deport Slovenes in large numbers , and allowing the Slovene language to be used in public . Likewise , the Hungarians curried favour with the <unk> minority in order to persuade them that they were neither Serbs nor Croats , nor even Slavs at all : they were " Hungarians of <unk> mother @-@ tongue " . 
 The Volksdeutsche of the occupied territories were an important part of the economies of the occupied territories , and by 1941 , they were entirely in the thrall of the Nazi Party . Relations between the occupation authorities and the Volksdeutsche were strained by the killing of ethnic Germans during the invasion , to the extent that Adolf Hitler became aware of the issue . The Volksdeutsche were not active in the Hungarian military or civil administration , but were represented in the Hungarian Parliament , and from 1942 were permitted to conscript their members into the Wehrmacht . The official organisation of the Volksdeutsche in Hungary , the <unk> der Deutschen in <unk> ( National League of Germans in Hungary ) , was essentially autonomous during the war , including within the occupied territories . 
 = = Districts = = 
 Bačka and Baranja had both been part of the Danube Banovina of Yugoslavia before the war . Međimurje had been part of the Banovina of Croatia , and Prekmurje had been part of the Drava Banovina . The Hungarian authorities referred to the occupied territories by the following names : Bácska for Bačka , Baranya for Baranja , <unk> for Međimurje , and <unk> for Prekmurje . Following the occupation , the Hungarian authorities divided the occupied territories between the counties that corresponded with the administrative divisions that had existed when the area had formed part of the Kingdom of Hungary prior to 1920 . These were the Bács @-@ Bodrog , Baranya , Vas and Zala Counties . The officials in these territories were appointed rather than elected . The counties were further divided into districts , and the authorities reverted many districts , cities and towns to the names used prior to 1920 , and in some cases to names which had no historical precedent . Some examples of the name changes in each county are shown below : 
 = = The Holocaust = = 
 In April 1941 , about 23 per cent of Yugoslav Jews ( about 16 @,@ 680 people ) lived in the territories occupied by Hungary . These included around 15 @,@ 405 in Bačka and Baranja , about 425 in Međimurje , and approximately 850 in Prekmurje . 
 The Hungarian government had passed anti @-@ Semitic laws in 1939 , and these were applied to the occupied and annexed territories . Initially the laws were applied selectively due to the transfer of the territories from military to civilian administration . Some Jews that had settled in the occupied territories were sent to the German @-@ occupied territory of Serbia where they were placed in the Banjica concentration camp in Belgrade and subsequently killed . Others were expelled to the NDH where they met the same fate , but it is unknown how many deported Jews died in this way . After the violence of the initial occupation , no further massacres of Jews occurred during the remainder of 1941 . 
 The Jews of the occupied territories were subjected to forced labour by the Hungarian authorities , with about 4 @,@ 000 Bačka and Baranja Jews being sent to hard labour camps within Hungary , 1 @,@ 500 Bačka Jews being among the 10 @,@ 000 Hungarian Jews sent to perform labour tasks for the Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front in September 1942 , and about 600 Bačka Jews sent to work in the Bor copper mine in the German @-@ occupied territory of Serbia in July 1943 . Only 2 per cent of those sent to the Eastern Front survived the war . 
 = = Resistance and repression = = 
 In Bačka and Baranja , the Volksdeutsche and Hungarian authorities killed significant numbers of Serbs . After small @-@ scale armed resistance broke out in Hungarian @-@ occupied Bačka and Baranja in the second half of 1941 , the Hungarian military reacted with heavy repressive measures . In September 1941 alone the Hungarian occupation forces summarily executed 313 people . Measures included the establishment of temporary concentration camps at Ada , Bačka Topola , <unk> , <unk> , Bečej and Subotica , as well as at Novi Sad , <unk> and Baja . According to Professor Paul Mojzes , some 2 @,@ 000 Jews and a large number of Serbs were detained in these camps for periods from two weeks to two months , with Jews that had not been interned being employed as forced labourers . Several thousand people remained in camps until the end of the war . Some of the Jews that had migrated to Bačka and Baranja during the inter @-@ war period were expelled to the NDH or the German @-@ occupied territory of Serbia where they were killed . The communist @-@ led Partisan resistance movement of Josip Broz Tito was never strong in Bačka and Baranja because the flat terrain of the region did not lend itself to guerilla warfare , and because South Slavs , from which the Partisans drew their recruits , only made up one @-@ third of the regional population . Some Partisan units raised in the occupied territories were sent to the NDH to reinforce Partisan formations operating there . Despite their initial resistance , the Chetnik movement was largely inactive during the occupation , maintaining some covert activity only . The Partisans and their regional committee had largely been destroyed by the end of 1941 . 
 In January 1942 , the Hungarian army and gendarmerie undertook a major raid in southern Bačka , during which they massacred 2 @,@ 550 Serbs , 743 Jews and 47 other people in places such as Bečej , Srbobran and Novi Sad , under the pretext that they were searching for Partisans . Other sources place the number of Serbs and Jews massacred in Novi Sad as being much lower , at around 879 . Raids were carried out in <unk> ( <unk> ) over 4 – 19 January ; in Novi Sad ( <unk> ) over 21 – 23 January ; and in Bečej ( <unk> ) over 25 – 29 January . Over the period 4 – 24 January , massacres were carried out by the Hungarian 15th Light Division commanded by Major General József Grassy and units of the Royal Gendarmerie . The operations were ordered by Grassy , Lieutenant General Ferenc Feketehalmy @-@ Czeydner , Colonel László Deák , and Royal Gendarmerie Captain Dr. <unk> Zöldi . In addition to Serbs and Jews , members of other ethnicities were also victims : Roma people , a small number of Russian refugees who had fled Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution , and some local Hungarians . In mid @-@ 1942 , the Yugoslav government @-@ in @-@ exile reported that churches had been looted and destroyed , and that Serbian Orthodox holy days had been prohibited by the Hungarian administration . These reports stated that the a camp in Novi Sad held 13 @,@ 000 Serb and Jewish men , women and children . 
 Under pressure from the Hungarian political opposition , the Hungarian government charged 14 Hungarian officers with high treason in relation to the massacres , including Feketehalmy @-@ Czeydner , Grassy , Deák and Zöldi . A military trial was held in Budapest between 23 December 1943 and January 1944 , and those that were convicted were sentenced to between 10 and 15 years imprisonment for their part in the massacres . Feketehalmy @-@ Czeydner , Grassy , Deák and Zöldi were not sentenced as they could not be located , and had fled to Germany . It is apparent from the trial proceedings that Zöldi was present during some of the trial . Professor <unk> <unk> has stated that those most responsible for the massacre were not tried before this military court , and that they included Prime Minister <unk> and the Minister for Interior Affairs Dr. Ferenc <unk> @-@ Fischer , both of whom appeared only as witnesses . <unk> also states that the Chief of the General Staff , Ferenc <unk> and the Minister of Defence should also have been examined by the court , that the " genocide had been planned by the highest military and political circles in Hungary for a long time in advance " , and had been intended to convince the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop that Hungarian troops were needed on its territory instead of the Eastern Front . In mid @-@ 1944 , Partisan activity increased in Bačka to such an extent that special regulations similar to the " Special Administrative Regulations " that applied to the operational zones of the Hungarian Army were extended to Bačka : curfews were imposed and political activities were forbidden . A self @-@ defence organization , the Pandurs , was created .

 = = = German occupation and the Holocaust = = = 
 The occupation of Bačka and Baranja lasted until 1944 . Fearing that Hungary might conclude a separate peace with the Allies , Hitler launched Operation Margarethe I on 15 March 1944 , and ordered German troops to occupy Hungary . In the meantime , some of those that had escaped prosecution for the 1942 massacres had joined various German military and police organisations . Feketehalmy @-@ Czeydner had become the highest @-@ ranking foreign officer in the Allgemeine SS , being promoted to SS @-@ Obergruppenführer ( lieutenant general ) . Grassy became a SS @-@ Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Waffen @-@ SS ( major general ) and was appointed to command the 25th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Hunyadi ( 1st Hungarian ) , and Zöldi joined the Gestapo . The case against them was re @-@ opened after the German occupation , and in this second trial they were all found not guilty . 
 After Germany occupied Hungary in March 1944 , the genocidal policies of the authorities were applied comprehensively . Hungarian Jews were subjected to starvation and death marches , and those that had remained in the occupied territories were transported to extermination camps . From 26 April 1944 , the remaining Jews in Bačka and Baranja , mostly women , but including children and the elderly , were rounded up into local concentration camps then moved to larger camps in Hungary proper . Between 14 @,@ 000 and 15 @,@ 000 Jews from Bačka , Baranja and other parts of Hungary were collected at Baja and <unk> then transported to Auschwitz where most were killed . In September 1944 , the workforce of the Bor mine was force @-@ marched for several weeks back to extermination camps where the survivors were killed . One of the two groups of workers numbered 2 @,@ 500 , but only a few survived . 
 Such was the extent of the Holocaust in the occupied territories that by the end of the war , nearly 85 per cent of the Jews that had been living in the Hungarian @-@ occupied Yugoslav territories in April 1941 had been killed . This figure comprised about 13 @,@ 500 Jews from Bačka and Baranja , and about 1 @,@ 300 from Međimurje and Prekmurje .

 In September 1944 , the Hungarian authorities began evacuating the Székelys settled in the occupied territories since 1941 to Transdanubia . Several days after the Soviet Red Army entered the Banat on 1 October 1944 , the Germans began the evacuation of Bačka , including the local Volksdeutsche . With the advance of the Partisans and the Red Army , some of the Volksdeutsche left the region while some others stayed , despite the situation . 
 In October 1944 , the Banat and Bačka were captured by Soviet troops . Subotica was captured on the 12 October . After a few weeks , they withdrew and ceded full control of the region to the Partisans , who established a military administration in the Banat , Bačka and Baranja on 17 October 1944 . In the first few weeks after Bačka returned to Yugoslav control , about 16 @,@ 800 Hungarians were killed by Serbs in revenge for killings during the Hungarian occupation . In November 1944 , Tito declared that the Volksdeutsche of Yugoslavia were hostile to the nation , and ordered the internment of those living in areas under Partisan control . About 60 @,@ 000 – 70 @,@ 000 Volksdeutsche had been evacuated from Bačka ; while an additional 30 @,@ 000 – 60 @,@ 000 from Bačka were serving in the Wehrmacht at the time .

 On 15 February 1945 , the Banat , Bačka and Baranja were transferred from military to civilian administration with a people 's liberation committee ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> <unk> , NOO ) taking control . Until early 1945 , the Yugoslav communist administration was characterized by persecution of some elements of the local population , with mass executions , internments and abuses . Approximately 110 @,@ 000 Volksdeutsche were interned , with around 46 @,@ 000 dying in captivity due to poor conditions in the camps and the hard labour they were subjected to . Victims of the communist regime were of various ethnic backgrounds and included some members of the Hungarian and Volksdeutsche population , as well as Serbs . The Hungarian writer Tibor <unk> has described in detail the crimes he claims the Yugoslav communists committed against Hungarians . An estimated 5 @,@ 000 Hungarians were killed following the return of the occupied territories to Yugoslav control . About 40 @,@ 000 Hungarians left the Banat , Bačka and Baranja after the war .

 After these territories returned to Yugoslav control , the military and national courts in Bačka prosecuted collaborators who had killed about 10 @,@ 000 – 20 @,@ 000 civilians . The Security Service of Vojvodina captured the majority of these people . Meanwhile , some of those who were responsible for the 1942 massacres in southern Bačka were captured in , and extradited from , the newly formed People 's Republic of Hungary . In his book <unk> u <unk> : 1941 – 1946 ( " Hungarians in Vojvodina : 1941 – 1946 " ; Novi Sad , 1996 ) , Professor Sándor <unk> from the University of Novi Sad listed a total of 1 @,@ 686 executed war criminals by name , of whom around 1 @,@ 000 were Hungarian .

In accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the Armistice Agreement , the Hungarian authorities then extradited them to Yugoslavia , where they underwent a fourth trial in Novi Sad in October 1946 .

 = Francesco Caracciolo @-@ class battleship = 
 The Francesco Caracciolo @-@ class battleships were a class of battleships designed for the Italian Regia Marina in 1912 – 1913 and ordered in 1914 ; the first ship of the class , Francesco Caracciolo , was laid down that year . The other three ships , Cristoforo Colombo , Marcantonio Colonna , and Francesco Morosini were all laid down in 1915 . Armed with a main battery of eight 381 mm ( 15 @.@ 0 in ) guns and possessing a top speed of 28 knots ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) , the four ships of the class were intended to be the equivalent of the British Queen Elizabeth class . They were never completed , however , due to material shortages and shifting construction priorities after the outbreak of World War I in 1914 . Only the lead ship was launched , and several proposals to convert her into an aircraft carrier were considered , but budgetary problems prevented any work being done . She was sold to an Italian shipping firm for conversion into a merchant ship . This too proved to be too expensive , and so she was broken up for scrap . 
 = = Design = = 
 In 1913 , Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel became the Chief of Staff of the Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) . He secured authorization for a huge new construction program , which called for four new battleships , three cruisers , and numerous other warships . The Francesco Caracciolo class was the first type of super @-@ dreadnought battleship designed by the Regia Marina . They were intended to match the new fast battleships being built in foreign navies , such as the British Queen Elizabeth class . Rear Admiral Edgardo Ferrati was responsible for preparing the designs . He originally called for a ship armed with twelve 381 @-@ millimetre ( 15 @.@ 0 in ) guns and twenty 152 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) secondary guns , but by the time he had finalized the design , he had reduced the main battery to eight guns and the secondary battery to twelve guns . 
 = = = Characteristics = = = 
 The Francesco Caracciolo class was 201 @.@ 6 m ( 661 ft ) long at the waterline and 212 m ( 696 ft ) long overall . They had a beam of 29 @.@ 6 m ( 97 ft ) and a draft of 9 @.@ 5 m ( 31 ft ) . They would have displaced 31 @,@ 400 metric tons ( 30 @,@ 900 long tons ; 34 @,@ 600 short tons ) at normal loading and up to 34 @,@ 000 t ( 33 @,@ 000 long tons ; 37 @,@ 000 short tons ) at full combat load . They were to be equipped with two tripod masts . 
 The ships would have been powered by four Parsons steam turbines , with steam provided by twenty oil @-@ fired Yarrow boilers . The boilers were trunked into two large funnels . The engines were rated at 105 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 78 @,@ 000 kW ) , which provided a top speed of 28 knots ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) . At a more economical speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) , the ships could have cruised for 8 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 15 @,@ 000 km ; 9 @,@ 200 mi ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Francesco Caracciolo and her sisters were to be armed with a main battery of eight 381 mm 40 @-@ caliber guns in four twin gun turrets , all mounted on the centerline in superfiring pairs fore and aft . They had a secondary battery of twelve 152 mm 45 @-@ caliber guns mounted in casemates clustered amidships . These were supplemented by eight 102 mm ( 4 @.@ 0 in ) 45 @-@ caliber guns . Anti @-@ aircraft defense was to be provided by twelve 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) autocannon . As was typical for capital ships of the period , the ships of the Francesco Caracciolo class were to be armed with eight torpedo tubes , either 450 mm ( 18 in ) or 533 mm ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) in diameter . 
 Armor for the class consisted of Krupp cemented steel manufactured by Terni . The main belt armor was 303 mm ( 11 @.@ 9 in ) thick ; horizontal protection consisted of a 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick deck . The main conning tower had 400 mm ( 16 in ) thick sides . The same level of protection was applied to the main battery turrets , while the secondary guns had 220 mm ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) of armor protection . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Francesco Caracciolo was laid down at the Castellammare shipyard on 16 October 1914 . Marcantonio Colonna was laid down on 3 March 1915 at the Odero Shipyard in Sestri Ponente . Cristoforo Columbo followed on eleven days later on the 14th , at the Ansaldo shipyard in Genoa . The last member of the class , Francesco Morosini , was laid down at the Orlando Shipyard in Livorno on 27 June 1915 . Francesco Caracciolo was the only member of the class to be launched , on 12 May 1920 . 
 Shortages of steel slowed the construction of the ships , and after Italy entered World War I , other classes of warships , particularly destroyers , submarines , and other light craft were needed to combat the Central Powers . As a result , work on the ships was suspended in March 1916 . Around 9 @,@ 000 t ( 8 @,@ 900 long tons ; 9 @,@ 900 short tons ) of steel had been built into the hull for Francesco Caracciolo when work stopped . Cristoforo Columbo was the next furthest along ship , with 12 @.@ 5 percent of the hull completed and 5 percent of the machinery assembled . Work on the last two ships had not progressed significantly by the time work on them halted . Two of the heavy guns intended for Cristoforo Colombo were installed aboard the monitor Faà di Bruno . The monitor Alfredo Cappellini received a pair of 381 mm guns from Francesco Morosini , and the two Monte Santo and four Monte Grappa @-@ class monitors were also equipped with spare 381 mm guns . Another pair of guns was installed in Venice as <unk> Amalfi to protect the harbor . 
 Work resumed on Francesco Caracciolo in October 1919 , but she was not to be completed . That year , the Regia Marina considered converting Francesco Caracciolo into a flush @-@ deck aircraft carrier similar to the British HMS Argus . The poor economic situation in Italy in the aftermath of World War I , and the heavy expenses of the Italian pacification campaigns in Libya , forced severe reductions in the naval budget . As a result , a modern carrier conversion could not be completed . Ansaldo proposed converting <unk> Caracciolo into a floatplane carrier , a cheaper alternative . It was nevertheless still too expensive for the Regia Marina . 
 In addition to the budgetary problems , the senior Italian navy commanders could not agree on the shape of the post @-@ war Regia Marina . One faction advocated a traditional surface battle fleet , while a second believed a fleet composed of aircraft carriers , torpedo boats , and submarines would be ideal . A third faction , led by Admiral Sechi , argued that a balanced fleet with a core of battleships and carriers was the most flexible option . In order to secure budgetary space for new construction , Sechi drastically reduced the number of older ships in service ; he also cancelled the battleships of the Francesco Caracciolo class . Francesco Caracciolo was sold on 25 October 1920 to the <unk> Generale Italiana shipping company . The firm planned to convert her into a merchant ship , but the work was deemed too expensive , and so she was temporarily mothballed in Baia Bay outside Naples . 
 By this time , the Regia Marina had returned to the idea of converting the ship into an aircraft carrier . In the on @-@ going negotiations Washington Naval Conference , the proposed tonnage limits for the Regia Marina was to be 60 @,@ 000 long tons ( 61 @,@ 000 t ) , which was now to include a converted Francesco Caracciolo and two new , purpose @-@ built ships . A new conversion design for Francesco Caracciolo was prepared , with an island superstructure , but Italy 's chronic budgetary problems prevented the navy from building any of these ships . Francesco Caracciolo was subsequently broken up for scrap , starting in the fall of 1926 . The other three ships had also been dismantled shortly after the end of the war . 
 = Mycena fuscoaurantiaca = 
 Mycena fuscoaurantiaca is a species of mushroom in the Mycenaceae family . First reported as a new species in 2007 , the diminutive mushroom is only found in Kanagawa , Japan , where it grows on dead fallen twigs in lowland forests dominated by hornbeam carpinus and Chinese evergreen oak trees . The mushroom has a brownish @-@ orange conical cap that has grooves extending to the center , and reaches up to 11 mm ( 0 @.@ 43 in ) in diameter . Its slender stem is colored similarly to the cap , and long — up to 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) tall . Microscopic characteristics include the weakly amyloid spores ( turning blue to black when stained with Melzer 's reagent ) , the smooth , swollen cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edges and faces , respectively ) with long rounded tips , the diverticulate hyphae of the cap cuticle , and the absence of clamp connections . 
 = = Taxonomy , naming , and classification = = 
 The mushroom was first collected by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi in 1999 and , along with seven other Mycena species , identified as a new species in a 2007 publication . The specific epithet is derived from the Latin words <unk> ( meaning " dark " ) and aurantiaca ( " orange @-@ yellow " ) , and refers to the color of the fruit bodies . Its Japanese name is <unk> @-@ ashinagatake <unk> ( <unk> ) . 
 Takahashi suggests that the species is best classified in the section Fragilipedes , as defined by Dutch Mycena specialist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus . Within the section , the North American species M. <unk> appears to be closely related to M. fuscoaurantiaca . M. <unk> may be distinguished by its spindle- to broadly club @-@ shaped cheilocystidia without a narrow neck , club @-@ shaped to irregularly shaped caulocystidia , and lack of pleurocystidia .

 = Diamonds Are Forever ( film ) = 
 Diamonds Are Forever ( 1971 ) is the seventh spy film in the James Bond series by Eon Productions , and the sixth and final Eon film to star Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond . 
 The film is based on Ian Fleming 's 1956 novel of the same name , and is the second of four James Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton . The story has Bond impersonating a diamond smuggler to infiltrate a smuggling ring , and soon uncovering a plot by his old nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld to use the diamonds to build a giant laser . Bond has to battle his nemesis for one last time , to stop the smuggling and stall Blofeld 's plan of destroying Washington , D.C. , and extorting the world with nuclear supremacy . 
 After George Lazenby left the series , producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli tested other actors , but studio United Artists wanted Sean Connery back , paying a then @-@ record $ 1 @.@ 25 million salary for him to return . The producers were inspired by Goldfinger , eventually hiring that film 's director , Guy Hamilton , as well as Shirley Bassey performing vocals on the title theme song . Locations included Las Vegas , California , Amsterdam and Lufthansa 's hangar in Germany . Diamonds Are Forever was a commercial success , but received criticism for its humorous camp tone . 
 = = Plot = = 
 James Bond — agent 007 — pursues Ernst Stavro Blofeld and eventually finds him at a facility where Blofeld look @-@ alikes are being created through surgery . Bond kills a test subject , and later the " real " Blofeld , by drowning him in a pool of superheated mud . 
 While assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd systematically kill several diamond smugglers , M suspects that South African diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by dumping , and orders Bond to uncover the smuggling ring . Disguised as professional smuggler and assassin Peter Franks , Bond travels to Amsterdam to meet contact Tiffany Case . The real Franks shows up on the way , but Bond intercepts and kills him , then switches IDs to make it seem like Franks is Bond . Case and Bond then go to Los Angeles , smuggling the diamonds inside Franks ' corpse . 
 At the airport Bond meets his CIA ally Felix Leiter , then travels to Las Vegas . At a funeral home , Franks ' body is cremated and the diamonds are passed on to another smuggler , Shady Tree . Bond is nearly killed by Wint and Kidd when they put him into a coffin and send to a cremation oven , but Tree stops the process when he discovers that the diamonds in Franks ' body were fakes planted by Bond and the CIA . 
 Bond tells Leiter to ship him the real diamonds . Bond then goes to the Whyte House , a casino @-@ hotel owned by the reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte , where Tree works as a stand @-@ up comedian . Bond discovers there that Tree has been killed by Wint and Kidd , who did not know that the diamonds were fake . 
 At the craps table Bond meets the opportunistic Plenty O 'Toole , and after gambling , brings her to his room . Gang members ambush them , throwing O 'Toole out the window and into the pool . Bond spends the rest of the night with Tiffany Case , instructing her to retrieve the real diamonds at the Circus Circus casino . 
 Tiffany reneges on her deal to meet back with Bond and instead flees , passing off the diamonds to the next smuggler . However , seeing that O 'Toole was killed after being mistaken for her , Tiffany changes her mind . She drives Bond to the airport , where the diamonds are given to Whyte 's casino manager , Bert Saxby , who is followed to a remote facility . Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds ; a research laboratory owned by Whyte , where a satellite is being built by Professor Metz , a laser refraction specialist . When Bond 's cover is blown , he escapes by stealing a moon buggy and reunites with Tiffany . 
 Bond scales the walls to the Whyte House 's top floor to confront Whyte . He is instead met by two identical <unk> , who use an electronic device to sound like Whyte . Bond kills one of the <unk> , which turns out to be a look @-@ alike . He is then knocked out by gas , picked up by Wint and Kidd , and taken out to Las Vegas Valley , where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die . 
 Bond escapes , then calls Blofeld , using a similar electronic device to pose as Saxby . He finds out Whyte 's location and rescues him , Saxby being killed in the gunfight . In the meantime , Blofeld abducts Case . With the help of Whyte , Bond raids the lab and uncovers Blofeld 's plot to create a laser satellite using the diamonds , which by now has already been sent into orbit . With the satellite , Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China , the Soviet Union and the United States , then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy . 
 Whyte identifies an oil platform off the coast of Baja California as Blofeld 's likely base of operations . After Bond 's attempt to change the cassette containing the satellite control codes fails due to a mistake by Tiffany , a helicopter attack on the oil rig is launched by Leiter and the CIA . 
 Blofeld tries to escape in a midget submarine , but Bond gains control of the submarine 's launch crane and crashes the sub into the control room , causing both the satellite control and the base to be destroyed . Bond and Tiffany then head for Britain on a cruise ship , where Wint and Kidd pose as room @-@ service stewards and attempt to kill them with a hidden bomb . Bond turns the tables on them , causing Kidd to hurl himself overboard after being set aflame and Wint to detonate with the bomb after being thrown overboard . Tiffany then asks James Bond a sensitive question : " How the hell do we get those diamonds down again ? "

 The producers originally intended to have Diamonds Are Forever re @-@ create commercially successful aspects of Goldfinger , including hiring its director , Guy Hamilton . Peter R.

 = = = Writing = = = 
 While On Her Majesty 's Secret Service was within its post @-@ production stages , Richard Maibaum wrote initial treatments and a script for Diamonds Are Forever as a revenge @-@ themed sequel with Irma Bunt and Marc @-@ Ange Draco returning , and Bond mourning his deceased wife Tracy while Louis Armstrong 's " We Have All the Time in the World " played in the background . When George Lazenby departed from the role prior to the film 's release , a complete rewrite was requested , in addition to Maibaum 's script failing to impress Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman . Following this , an original plot had as a villain Auric Goldfinger 's twin , seeking revenge for the death of his brother . The plot was later changed after Albert R. Broccoli had a dream , where his close friend Howard Hughes was replaced by an imposter . So the character of Willard Whyte was created , and Tom Mankiewicz was chosen to rework the script . Mankiewicz says he was hired because Cubby Broccoli wanted an American writer to work on the script , since so much of it was set in Las Vegas " and the Brits write really lousy American gangsters " — but it had to be someone who also understood the British idiom , since it had British characters . David Picker from United Artists had seen the stage musical Georgy ! written by Mankiewicz , and recommended him ; he who was hired on a two week trial and kept on for the rest of the movie . Mankiewicz later estimated the novel provided around 45 minutes of the film 's final running time . 
 The adaptation eliminated the main villains from the source Ian Fleming novel , mobsters called Jack and Seraffimo Spang , but used the henchmen Shady Tree , Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd . 
 Richard Maibaum 's original idea for the ending was a giant boat chase across Lake Mead with Blofeld being pursued by Bond and all the Las Vegas casino owners who would be sailing in their private yachts . Bond would rouse the allies into action with a spoof of Lord Nelson 's famous cry , " Las Vegas expects every man to do his duty . " Maibaum was misinformed ; there were no Roman galleys or Chinese junks in Las Vegas , and the idea was too expensive to replicate , so it was dropped . 
 Maibaum may have thought the eventual oil rig finale a poor substitute , but it was originally intended to be much more spectacular . Armed frogmen would jump from the helicopters into the sea and attach limpet mines to the rig 's legs ( this explains why frogmen appear on the movie 's poster ) . Blofeld would have escaped in his <unk> and Bond would have pursued him hanging from a weather balloon . The chase would have then continued across a salt mine with the two mortal enemies scrambling over the pure white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt <unk> . Permission was not granted by the owners of the salt mine . It also made the sequence too long . Further problems followed when the explosives set up for the finale were set off too early ; fortunately , a handful of cameras were ready and able to capture the footage . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 George Lazenby originally was offered a contract for seven Bond films , but declined and left after just one , On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , on the advice of his agent . Producers contemplated replacing him with John Gavin ( though Batman star Adam West was also considered ) , as well as Michael Gambon , who rejected the offer telling Broccoli that he was " in terrible shape . " United Artists ' chief David Picker was unhappy with this decision and made it clear that Connery was to be enticed back to the role and that money was no object . When approached about resuming the role of Bond , Connery demanded the fee of £ 1 @.@ 25 million and to entice the actor to play Bond one more time United Artists offered to back two films of his choice . After both sides agreed to the deal , Connery used the fee to establish the Scottish International Education Trust , where Scottish artists could apply for funding without having to leave their country to pursue their careers . Since John Gavin was no longer in the running for the role , his contract was paid in full by United Artists . The first film made under Connery 's deal was The <unk> directed by his friend Sidney Lumet . The second was to be an adaptation of Macbeth by William Shakespeare using only Scottish actors and in which Connery himself would play the title role . This project was abandoned because another production of Macbeth ( the Roman Polanski version ) was already in production . 
 Charles Gray was cast as villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld , after playing a Bond ally named Dikko Henderson in You Only Live Twice ( 1967 ) . David Bauer , who plays Morton Slumber , previously appeared uncredited as an American diplomat also in You Only Live Twice . 
 Jazz musician Putter Smith was invited by Harry Saltzman to play Mr. Kidd after a Thelonious Monk Band show . Musician Paul Williams was originally cast as Mr. Wint . When he couldn 't agree with the producers on compensation , Bruce Glover replaced him . Glover said he was surprised at being chosen , because at first producers said he was too normal and that they wanted a deformed , Peter Lorre @-@ like actor . 
 Film star Bruce Cabot , who played the part of Bert Saxby , died the following year and this turned out to be his final film role . Jimmy Dean was cast as Willard Whyte after Saltzman saw a presentation of him . Dean was very worried about playing a Howard Hughes pastiche , because he was an employee of Hughes at the Desert Inn . 
 Actresses considered for the role of Tiffany Case included : Raquel Welch , Jane Fonda and Faye Dunaway . Jill St. John had originally been offered the part of Plenty O 'Toole but landed the female lead after Sidney <unk> who assisted the producers in filming in Las Vegas locations recommended his client St. John , who became the first American Bond girl . Lana Wood was cast as Plenty O 'Toole following a suggestion of screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz . The woman in the bikini named " Marie " , who in the beginning of the film is convinced by Bond to give up the location of Blofeld , was Denise Perrier , Miss World 1953 . 
 A cameo appearance by Sammy Davis , Jr. playing on the roulette table was filmed , but his scene was eventually deleted .

 Filming began on 5 April 1971 , with the South African scenes actually shot in the desert near Las Vegas , and finished on 13 August 1971 . The film was shot primarily in the US , with locations including the Los Angeles International Airport , Universal City Studios and eight hotels of Las Vegas . Besides the Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire , other places in England were Dover and Southampton . The climactic oil rig sequence was shot off the shore of Oceanside , California . Other filming locations included Cap D 'Antibes in France for the opening scenes , Amsterdam and Lufthansa 's hangar at Frankfurt Airport , Germany . 
 Filming in Las Vegas took place mostly in hotels owned by Howard Hughes , since he was a friend of Cubby Broccoli . Getting the streets empty to shoot was achieved through the collaboration of Hughes , the Las Vegas police and shopkeepers association . The Las Vegas Hilton doubled for the Whyte House , and since the owner of the Circus Circus was a Bond fan , he allowed the Circus to be used on film and even made a cameo . The cinematographers said filming in Las Vegas at night had an advantage : no additional illumination was required due to the high number of neon lights . Sean Connery made the most of his time on location in Las Vegas . " I didn 't get any sleep at all . We shot every night , I caught all the shows and played golf all day . On the weekend I collapsed – boy , did I collapse . Like a skull with legs . " He also played the slot machines , and once delayed a scene because he was collecting his winnings . 
 The site used for the Willard Whyte Space Labs ( where Bond gets away in the Moon Buggy ) was actually , at that time , a Johns @-@ Manville gypsum plant located just outside Las Vegas . The home of Kirk Douglas was used for the scene in Tiffany 's house , while the Elrod House in Palm Springs , designed by John Lautner , became Willard Whyte 's house . The exterior shots of the Slumber mortuary were of the Palm Mortuary in Henderson , NV . The interiors were a set constructed at Pinewood Studios , where Ken Adam imitated the real building 's lozenge @-@ shaped stained glass window in its nave . During location filming , Adam visited several funeral homes in the Las Vegas area , the inspiration behind the gaudy design of the Slumber mortuary ( the use of tasteless Art Nouveau furniture and Tiffany lamps ) came from these experiences . Production wrapped with the crematorium sequence , on 13 August 1971 . 
 Since the car chase in Las Vegas would have many car crashes , the filmmakers had an arrangement with Ford to use their vehicles . Ford 's only demand was that Sean Connery had to drive the 1971 Mustang Mach 1 which serves as Tiffany Case 's car . The Moon Buggy was inspired by the actual NASA vehicle , but with additions such as flailing arms since the producers didn 't find the design " outrageous " enough . Built by custom car fabricator Dean Jeffries on a rear @-@ engined <unk> chassis , it was capable of road speeds . The fibreglass tires had to be replaced during the chase sequence because the heat and irregular desert soil ruined them . 
 Hamilton had the idea of making a fight scene inside a lift , which was choreographed and done by Sean Connery and stuntman Joe Robinson . The car chase where the red Mustang comes outside of the narrow street on the opposite side in which it was rolled , was filmed over three nights on Fremont Street in Las Vegas . The alleyway car roll sequence is actually filmed in two locations . The entrance was at the car park at Universal Studios and the exit was at Fremont Street , Las Vegas . It eventually inspired a continuity mistake , as the car enters the alley on the right side tires and exits the street driving on the left side . While filming the scene of finding Plenty O 'Toole drowned in Tiffany 's swimming pool , Lana Wood actually had her feet loosely tied to a cement block on the bottom . Film crew members held a rope across the pool for her , with which she could lift her face out of the water to breathe between takes . The pool 's sloping bottom made the block slip into deeper water with each take . Eventually , Wood was submerged but was noticed by on @-@ lookers and rescued before actually drowning . Wood , being a certified diver , took some water but remained calm during the ordeal , although she later admitted to a few " very uncomfortable moments and quite some struggling until they pulled me out . " 
 = = = Music = = = 
 " Diamonds Are Forever " , the title song , was the second James Bond theme to be performed by Shirley Bassey , after " Goldfinger " in 1964 . Producer Harry Saltzman reportedly hated the song , and only the insistence of co @-@ producer Cubby Broccoli kept it in the film . Saltzman 's major objection was to the sexual innuendo of the lyrics . Indeed , in an interview for the television programme James Bond 's Greatest Hits composer John Barry revealed that he told Bassey to imagine she was singing about a penis . Bassey would later return for a third performance for 1979 's Moonraker . 
 The original soundtrack was once again composed by John Barry , his sixth time composing for a Bond film . 
 With Connery back in the lead role , the " James Bond Theme " was played by an electric guitar in the somewhat unusual , <unk> gunbarrel sequence accompanied with prismatic ripples of light , and pre @-@ credits sequence , and in a full orchestral version during a hovercraft sequence in Amsterdam . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Diamonds are Forever premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square . It was released on 14 December 1971 . It grossed $ 116 million worldwide , of which $ 43 million was from the United States . 
 Reviews were mixed , and the camp tone had a mostly negative reaction . The film currently has a 67 % " fresh " rating on Rotten Tomatoes . Connery was applauded by Kevin A. Ranson of <unk> and Michael A. Smith of Nolan 's Pop Culture . Critic Roger Ebert criticised the complexity of the plot and " moments of silliness " such as Bond finding himself driving a moon buggy with antennae revolving and robot arms flapping . He praised the Las Vegas car chase scene , particularly the segment when Bond drives the Mustang on two wheels . Twenty @-@ five years after its release , James Berardinelli criticised the concept of a laser @-@ shooting satellite and the performances of Jill St. John , Norman Burton and Jimmy Dean . Christopher Null called St. John " one of the least effective Bond girls – beautiful , but shrill and helpless " . Steve Rhodes said , " looking and acting like a couple of pseudo @-@ country bumpkins , they ( Putter Smith and Bruce Glover ) seem to have wandered by accident from the adjoining sound stage into the filming of this movie . " But he also extolled the car chase as " classic " . According to Danny Peary , Diamonds are Forever is " one of the most forgettable movies of the entire Bond series " and that " until Blofeld 's reappearance we must watch what is no better than a mundane diamond @-@ smuggling melodrama , without the spectacle we associate with James Bond : the Las Vegas setting isn 't exotic enough , there 's little humour , assassins Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint are similar to characters you 'd find on The Avengers , but not nearly as amusing – and the trouble Bond gets into , even Maxwell Smart could escape . " IGN chose it as the third worst James Bond film , behind only The Man with the Golden Gun and Die Another Day . Total Film listed Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd , and Bambi and Thumper , as the first and second worst villains in the Bond series ( respectively ) . The film was more positively received by Xan Brooks of the Guardian who said it was " oddly brilliant , the best of the bunch : the perfect bleary Bond film for an imperfect bleary western world . " 
 The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound for Gordon McCallum , John W. Mitchell and Al Overton . It lost to Fiddler on the Roof .

 = Tommy Thompson presidential campaign , 2008 = 
 The Tommy Thompson presidential campaign of 2008 began when the former Wisconsin Governor and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president of the United States on April 1 , 2007 . Thompson centered his campaign in Iowa , focusing primarily on the issues of health care reform and the War in Iraq . He dropped out of the race on August 12 , 2007 following a sixth @-@ place finish in the Ames straw poll and went on to endorse Rudy Giuliani for president and then John McCain following Giuliani 's withdrawal . 
 Had he been elected , Thompson would have become the second Roman Catholic president ( after John F. Kennedy ) and the first Wisconsin @-@ born president . He was the first former Secretary of Health and Human Services to seek the presidency . 
 = = Background = = 
 Tommy Thompson 's political career began in 1966 upon his election to the Wisconsin State Assembly after graduating from law school at University of Wisconsin – Madison . While in the assembly , he received the nickname of " Dr. No " for blocking legislation through parliamentary procedure . He was named assistant minority leader of the body in 1973 and became minority leader in 1981 . He unsuccessfully ran for United States Congress in 1979 , losing in the Republican primary to Tom Petri . 
 Thompson was elected Governor of Wisconsin in 1986 . He was re @-@ elected three times . During his tenure , he successfully pushed for welfare reform through Wisconsin Works , a workfare program . Welfare participation decreased by 90 % under the program . Thompson also successfully backed a school voucher program . Near the end of his governorship , Thompson implemented <unk> , which provided health coverage for children ineligible for Medicaid . As governor , Thompson vetoed bills frequently and often exercised the line @-@ item veto . None of his vetoes were overturned . Thompson served as chairman of the National Governors Association from 1995 to 1996 . He was considered as a potential running mate for Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole in 1996 , but was passed over for Jack Kemp . Thompson left as governor during his fourth term in 2001 to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services in the George W. Bush administration . 
 As Secretary of Health and Human Services , Thompson introduced measures to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health and reorganized the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services . His position attained a unique significance following the attacks of 9 / 11 and the subsequent anthrax attacks . He was responsible for national preparedness in the event of bioterrorism . Though he wished to resign from the position in 2003 , Bush asked that he stay on for the rest of Bush 's first term . Thompson announced his resignation at a press conference in December 2004 in which he surprisingly admitted , " I , for the life of me , cannot understand why the terrorists have not attacked our food supply . " He officially left the position in January 2005 and began work in the private sector . 
 = = Exploration = = 
 Beginning in 2006 , Thompson spent every weekend in Iowa to build an organization for his potential presidential run . He opened an exploratory committee on November 16 , 2006 to test the waters , stating that " The times are right for my ideas . " He hired Rodman P. Hise as the treasurer of the committee , and gained the assistance of former advisers from his previous campaigns , including fundraiser Phil Prange , and former press secretary Darrin Schmitz , who was eventually hired as political director . A Washington Post @-@ ABC News poll placed Thompson at 2 % in December 2006 . He fell to 1 % in January 2007 , but climbed back to 2 % the following month . 
 As his eventual entrance neared , Thompson spent additional time in Iowa and announced that his campaign strategy would focus on the state and its nonbinding straw poll held in August . Former Iowa State Representative Steve Grubbs was added as the campaign 's consultant for the state . Grubbs had planned to work on the presidential campaign of Senator George Allen , but his usage of an offensive term prevented him from entering the race . Though Thompson was not yet considered a " viable candidate " , Grubbs felt that the frontrunners John McCain , Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney were unacceptable to the Republican base . He believed that Thompson " had more experience " than any other candidate , and could unify the party . 
 In order to be a " viable candidate " , Cook Political Report editor Jennifer Duffy commented that Thompson would have to raise at least $ 35 to $ 50 million by June . He raised $ 314 @,@ 000 in the first quarter of 2007 . 
 = = On the campaign trail = = 
 = = = Announcement = = = 
 Thompson officially entered the race on April 1 , 2007 following the announcement that he would seek the Republican Party 's nomination for president during an interview on This Week with George Stephanopoulos . He branded himself as a reliant conservative whose campaign was " looking good " due to the base he was attempting to establish in Iowa . The state would hold the nation 's first presidential caucus in January 2008 . His entrance into the race slightly increased voter 's recognition of " Thompson " in polls but pollsters stated that this increase was most likely attributed to the exposure of potential candidate Fred Thompson . He remained at 2 % in presidential polls , in sixth place overall behind potential candidates Newt Gingrich and Fred Thompson , but ahead of declared candidates Ron Paul , Jim Gilmore , Tom Tancredo , Sam Brownback , Duncan Hunter and Mike Huckabee . Statewide polls placed Thompson at 24 % in his home state of Wisconsin , which was considerably higher than the marks achieved by other lower tiered candidates in their home states . Upon his entrance , the candidate set forth his position on the War in Iraq , holding that as president , he would allow Iraqis to vote on whether or not the United States military should remain in the nation . He stated that if the Iraqis " don 't want us there ... we should get out . " 
 = = = April 2007 = = = 
 Thompson first hit the trails in Iowa . His strategy in the state was to spend more time there than any other candidate , emphasizing that he " intend [ ed ] to win Iowa " because of his midwest roots . He commented on fiscal responsibility at an event in a Des Moines suburb stating that " Republicans went to Washington and we lost our way " because " we tried to spend [ money ] like Democrats . " He introduced a health care platform that emphasized prevention and called for reforms in the current system to ensure that all Americans be covered in the future . In the financial sphere of the campaign , Thompson acknowledged that he could not compete with funds being raised by the upper @-@ tiered candidates , but he stated that he did not intend to do so because his campaign was " different " than the others ; according to Thompson , his was more centered around a strong ground organization in Iowa . 
 Thompson was criticized when he stated at a Jewish event that he believed earning money is " part of the Jewish tradition . " Later at the event he stated that he was not trying to " imply anything about Jews and finances " but that he was " compliment [ ing ] " Jews for being " outstanding business people . " His spokesman later said that he had " misspoke . " Despite this setback , the campaign was given a boost later in the month when columnist George Will wrote in an editorial that Thompson was the " Republican presidential candidate with perhaps the most impressive résumé . " He finished April campaigning in Iowa continuing with the strategy he planned . 
 = = = May 2007 = = = 
 Thompson began May at the first Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley , California sponsored by MSNBC on May 3 . During the debate , he again voiced his support for an Iraqi vote , and included the plan 's second phase if the Iraqis chose for American forces to remain in the nation . He stated that the oil revenues could have been split and a system of federalism could have been established . When asked about abortion , Thompson stated that he believed its legalization should be left up to the individual states , disagreeing with the precedent set in Roe v. Wade . He was also given the opportunity to discuss his governorship of Wisconsin , highlighting his record of 1 @,@ 900 vetoes and the overall cutting of taxes by $ 16 @.@ 4 billion . On the subject of taxes , he articulated his support for the option of a flat tax for the taxpayer , if it was to their benefit . At the end of the debate , Thompson differentiated himself from President George W. Bush stating that as president he would " transform the health care system " and settle the situation in Iraq . 
 A comment he made during the debate became another campaign issue for Thompson . He again apologized for remarks , this time over an answer to a question in which he stated that he believed the decision to fire a gay worker based on the morals of the employer is something that should be " left up to the individual business . " A few days following the debate , the candidate rescinded the comments , and blamed the gaffe on a malfunctioning hearing aid , stating that he " didn 't hear the question . " Thompson also said that he was sick during the debate , having been hospitalized three days earlier with the flu and bronchitis , and that all he could think about " was getting off the stage . " Campaign adviser Steve Grubbs would later point to this episode as the moment Thompson 's campaign became " unrecoverable . " Thompson was harshly criticized for the remarks . Jason Stephany , the political director of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin , rhetorically asked " How many times is he going to say something that 's completely offensive to the majority of Americans before people start to say , ' What 's going on here ? ' " Thompson tried to reassure the public that there was " nothing discriminatory about [ himself ] at all . " Afterwards , he finished second in a poll of state convention members from Wisconsin , with 84 of the 306 members polled , trailing Fred Thompson who received 95 votes . He stood at 16 % in an average of statewide polls for the state in May , and stood at 4 @.@ 3 % in Iowa , where he based his campaign . 
 Thompson participated in the May 15 GOP debate , where he discussed his insistence to trim bureaucracy in the federal government , and his support for the advancements made in stem cell research , lauding the achievements of the his alma mater University of Wisconsin – Madison in the field . He was asked what he would do in the event of a looming preemptive attack against a hypothetical anti @-@ American nation promoting terrorism . The candidate quoted former Secretary of State Colin Powell reflecting the need to be sure the intelligence was correct , to deploy the right amount of troops and to make sure that an exit strategy was planned . Following the debate , Thompson campaigned in New Hampshire before taking a break for the rest of the month . 
 = = = June 2007 = = = 
 After a day of campaigning in Iowa , Thompson returned to New Hampshire to participate in the June 5 GOP Debate . He discussed the issue of illegal immigration , arguing that the border should be secured before passing Comprehensive Immigration Reform . He later commented that once the border was secured , " there should be no amnesty " for illegal immigrants and that the proposed Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 was " an amnesty bill " , which he opposed . When asked about the potential candidate of his namesake , Thompson responded by saying " if you ’ re talking about a reliable conservative , it is THIS Thompson — Tommy Thompson , not the actor ( Fred Thompson ) . " After being questioned about the biggest mistake of the George W. Bush presidency , as a former member of the cabinet Thompson responded : 
 We went to Washington to change Washington and Washington changed us . We didn ’ t come up with new ideas . We got to transform health care . We got to wind — we got to wind down the war in Iraq . We got to make sure that we really are conservatives . If we ’ re going to spend money like — as foolishly and as stupidly as the Democrats , the voters are going to vote for the professional spending , the Democrat not the amateur <unk> , the Republican . 
 He later joked that " I would certainly not send him to the United Nations . " Following the debate , Thompson continued his criticism of the Bush administration . While campaigning in New Hampshire , he stated that he " would be a much more open president " than Bush . He criticized the handling of the Iraq War as " a terrible mistake " and assessed the president as " very cloistered ... [ with ] very few inner @-@ circle people . " 
 A few days later , Thompson sent out an e @-@ mail alerting the press about a conference call where he would make major announcement about the campaign . Though some speculated that Thompson would drop out of the race during the call , he instead announced his intentions to participate in the Ames Straw Poll . The move reaffirmed his strategy of relying on the straw poll to propel him from the lower tier , despite moves by the campaigns of Rudy Giuliani and John McCain to withdraw from the event . Drake University political science professor Dennis Goldford analyzed the straw poll strategy and commented that if Thompson " didn 't make some sort of substantive showing " it would be hard for his money flow to continue . 
 In late June , the three Republican Representatives from Wisconsin commented on Thompson 's campaign . Though Representative Tom Petri identified himself as a supporter and hailed Thompson for doing " a lot for the country and the state and the Republican Party of Wisconsin " he called Thompson " a long shot " and stopped short of endorsing him . Representative Jim <unk> described Thompson 's campaign as " anemic " and Representative Paul Ryan commented that " I think a lot of us are hoping the best for Tommy and are wishing him well but are just sort of watching the field to see how it materializes . " Other Republicans wondered if Thompson was running just to " get it out of his system . " Strategist Mark Graul argued that the former governor " had a profound impact " on party members in Wisconsin , which had created a familiarity complex that caused people to say " ' Oh , come on ' " after hearing of his run . Despite the qualms , spokesman Steve Grubbs remarked that Thompson wants " for people to give him a chance ... [ because ] he knows he has a lot to prove , and he is working 90 hours a week to prove it . " A Strategic vision poll of Iowa voters placed Thompson in fifth place among the candidates , with only 6 percent support . To improve his standing ahead of the Ames Straw Poll , Thompson planned to escalate his Iowa campaign after July 4 in a swing labeled the " Common Sense Solutions Tour " . Communications director <unk> Remley remarked that despite low amounts of capital , Thompson would spend " scads of time in Iowa in July . " He compared Thompson 's strategy to Jimmy Carter 's 1976 " retail politics " strategy that led to victory in the Iowa caucuses . 
 To close the month , Thompson campaigned in Iowa , and made a brief stop in New Hampshire on June 25 . On June 26 , he won the Linn County straw poll at Kirkwood Community College in Cedar Rapids . 
 = = = July 2007 = = = 
 In July , Thompson campaigned extensively in Iowa , hoping to gain traction before the Ames Straw poll . As planned , he began his " Common Sense Solutions Tour " after the July 4 holiday , and traveled throughout Iowa in an ethanol @-@ fueled Winnebago . After Mitt Romney embarked on a similar campaign bus tour , Thompson accused Romney of " copying " his idea . Thompson 's first stop of the month was scheduled in Ames on the evening of July 6 , but he was unable to make the event due to plane malfunction . He instead opened his tour in Webster City on July 7 . 
 During one stop on the first leg of his " Common Sense Solutions Tour " , Thompson made a bold promise . He proclaimed that if elected president , his administration would eliminate breast cancer by 2015 . Once accomplished , he planned to " then attack every major cancer one after the other . " Thompson explained that the disease had afflicted his family as well as millions of others and stated that " there 's no candidate in either party more prepared and more motivated to lead this effort than me . " He compared the announcement to President Kennedy 's pledge to put a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s . The plan consisted of increases in funding for cancer research , including a doubling of the National Institute of Health 's budget and additional incentives for private medical professionals to find a cure . Furthermore , Thompson remarked that as part of the plan , he would travel the world to promote cures , improving the United States ' international standing . David Miller of CBS News questioned whether the announcement was " a desperate measure by a desperate candidate , or a well @-@ thought out policy by a former Health and Human Services secretary . " He added , " we can 't say for sure , but this item is proof that it did succeed in drawing attention to the other Thompson in the race . " 
 After eight straight days of campaigning , Thompson concluded the first leg of his tour on July 14 . Like all other Republican presidential candidates except Congressman Tom Tancredo , Thompson chose to skip the July 12 presidential debate sponsored by the NAACP . 
 On July 15 , new financial reports were released that revealed that Thompson had raised $ 445 @,@ 000 during the second quarter of 2007 and had $ 115 @,@ 000 cash on hand . This showed a slight increase from his first quarter figures , but was still far below his fellow Republican candidates . Among the candidates , he ranked second to last in fundraising , just ahead of Jim Gilmore , who dropped out of the race a day before the financial disclosure . Thompson stated earlier in the month that he was " pleased at the strong growth " in fundraising , and that he was still " able to run a campaign equal to that of the better @-@ funded candidates despite the differences in funding . " Additionally , Thompson remained low in nationwide polls , standing at three percent in a July 21 Washington Post @-@ ABC News survey , which actually reflected a two @-@ point increase in support from June . 
 Thompson addressed the monthly meeting of the San Diego Republican Party on July 16 , before returning to Iowa on July 19 for the second leg of the " Common Sense Solutions Tour " . He campaigned in the state for the next four days before taking a few days off . He returned to Iowa for the third and final leg of the tour on July 28 and remained there until the end of the month . David Wise of <unk> following Thompson during part of the final leg of the tour . He maintained a blog that described every event attended by Thompson and his interaction with voters . Wise also witnessed a spat between Thompson and fellow presidential candidate Tom Tancredo . Thompson criticized Tancredo for negative campaigning after discovering that he had sent out a mailer that referred to Thompson as a " moderate governor " that supported amnesty for illegal immigrants . He labelled the mailer a " hate piece " put out by " somebody who 's way behind and is trying to attack me " . At one event , as he countered Tancredo 's claims , Tancredo himself entered the building , leading Thompson to point him out . He proceeded to list his accomplishments as governor and remarked " I have been against amnesty my whole career , contrary to what one of my opponents has said . " 
 Around this time , Thompson accepted an invitation to CNN 's YouTube debate despite assurances from Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney that they would not appear . Romney referenced the Democratic Party 's YouTube debate , and commented that " the presidency ought to be held at a higher level than having to answer questions from a snowman . " In response , Thompson 's spokesman Steve Grubbs remarked : " We 'll answer questions from any American who wants to ask one and that includes one dressed up like a snowman ... Tommy Thompson is ready to take on all questions " . 
 After spending nearly all of the month campaigning in Iowa , Thompson said at the end of July that if he failed to win or come in second at the state 's straw poll , he would drop out of the race . He admitted that the campaign significantly lacked funding and that he was spending large amounts of his own money to stay afloat . He believed that a strong showing could improve his ability to raise funds , and planned to bus supporters to the straw poll and pay the $ 35 entrance fee for each . 
 In an interview with <unk> , Thompson commented that he had more experience than any other candidate in the race , and that only Democrat Bill Richardson came close . He believed that his experience , combined with his efforts in Iowa would make up for his lack of funds . Thompson proclaimed to Pajamas Media that he would be " shocked " if he did not win the straw poll , and in his own personal analysis of the race , commented : " I wouldn 't say Romney 's in trouble , but I 'd say I think it 's going to be between Romney and myself . " In late July 2007 , at a Des Moines coffee shop , with an audience of 40 , Thompson said : " I wouldn 't be doing this if I didn 't think I could win . " 
 = = = August 2007 = = = 
 Thompson continued his strategy in Iowa heading into August , speaking on the trail about how " remarkably well " his campaign had been going . It was revealed that the campaign was running on an $ 890 @,@ 000 budget and that no speechwriters or pollsters had been hired . In August , Thompson achieved his goal of having campaigned in all 99 Iowa counties . 
 He competed in his final debate on August 5 in Des Moines . During the discourse , the candidate made the same points he had in previous debates , emphasizing health care , federalism , and popular sovereignty in Iraq . He described the war on terrorism as a " holy war " the United States was losing because of a lack of unity . At the end of the debate , Thompson made his last plea before the upcoming Ames straw poll , addressing his wish for Republicans , Democrats and Independents to unite to " start building America a stronger and healthier and better tomorrow than ever before . "

 On August 11 , 2007 , Thompson finished in sixth place at the Ames straw poll with 1 @,@ 039 votes or about seven percent of the total . Romney won the most votes , but his victory was overshadowed by the surprisingly strong showing of the second place Mike Huckabee . Huckabee considered skipping the straw poll , but decided to participate after a conversation with Thompson earlier in the summer . After the event , Thompson dropped out of the race . Campaign spokesman Brian Dumas commented that he had " worked very hard ... [ and ] did everything we asked of him and more . " The next day , Thompson released a statement on his withdrawal : 
 I felt my record as Governor of Wisconsin and Secretary of Health and Human Services gave me the experience I needed to serve as president , but I respect the decision of the voters . I am leaving the campaign trail today , but I will not leave the challenges of improving health care and welfare in America .

 Two months after his withdrawal , Thompson endorsed Rudy Giuliani for president . He praised the former New York City mayor as someone who " can and will win the nomination and the presidency " and argued that " during a period of time of great stress for this country he showed tremendous leadership " as " America 's mayor " . After Giuliani 's withdrawal in 2008 , Thompson backed John McCain , who ultimately won the Republican Party 's nomination . During the general election , Thompson told The New York Times that he was not satisfied with McCain 's campaign and that " I don ’ t know who is . " McCain lost the election to Democratic Senator Barack Obama . 
 In 2011 , Thompson entered the 2012 race for the Senate seat vacated by retiring Democratic Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin . Thompson won the GOP nomination but lost to Representative Tammy Baldwin . 
 = The Boxmasters = 
 The Boxmasters is an American country rock / rockabilly band founded in Bellflower , California in 2007 . It features Academy Award @-@ winning actor Billy Bob Thornton playing the drummer and vocalist , with J.D. Andrew on rhythm guitar , Danny Baker ( aka Unknown Hinson ) on bass guitar , Brad Davis doing vocals and playing lead guitar , and Micheal Wayne Butler on guitars and lap steel . The group has released three albums on Vanguard Records , the first being the eponymous The Boxmasters and the second being the holiday album Christmas Cheer , in 2008 . 
 Before he started The Boxmasters , frontman Thornton had played in two cover bands , worked as a roadie , and released four solo albums . After listening to " Yesterday 's Gone " by Chad & Jeremy and thinking about covering it in a hillbilly music style , he had the idea of making Americanized version of British Invasion pop songs . During its early days , the band played several live shows in the California area , as well as in Tecate , Mexico . From mid @-@ 2008 to late @-@ 2008 , the group embarked on a tour across the United States , ending in Los Angeles . It also played for the March 2009 South by Southwest conference . The group went on to play in Canada in early @-@ 2009 . In the aftermath of a controversial interview on the CBC Radio One program Q in early @-@ April 2009 , in which Thornton labeled his Canadian audience ' mashed potatoes with no gravy ' , the band stopped its Canadian tour early . It resumed touring in mid @-@ April 2009 in the United States .

 Billy Bob Thornton — credited on the band 's material as W. R. Thornton — has said that " [ he ] never intended to become a movie star , it happened accidentally . [ ... ] Music is what I love . " Before his acting career started , he played in cover bands for Creedence Clearwater Revival , ZZ Top , and also worked as a roadie with Nitty Gritty Dirt Band , Johnny Paycheck , Blood , Sweat & Tears , the Statler Brothers , and other bands during high school . He also released a record with a band called ' Hot Lanta ' in 1974 . Over his acting career , Thornton released four solo albums from 2001 to 2007 . 
 Thornton brought in sound engineer J. D. Andrew to help with his 2007 album Beautiful Door . After jamming together and finding a common sound , they started to record some of their material . Andrew had known Mike Butler " for six or seven years " and called him up to play guitar for them . According to Andrew , after the trio played together , they said " Shoot , this sounds like a band . " The three came up with the name " Boxmasters " after a piece of Southern slang , which they later described by saying " remember the bad boy in high school who got all the girls and left a trail of broken hearts ... and more ? " Thornton had also briefly played in country star Porter Wagoner 's similarly titled band ' The <unk> ' , which he later said had brought chills down his spine . 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 The band started in Bellflower , California in 2007 . During its early days , the band played several live shows in the California area , as well as in Tecate , Mexico . Their eponymous first album The Boxmasters was released on June 10 , 2008 with Vanguard Records . It received a mostly poor review from Allmusic , which stated that " The Boxmasters might work live because there will be visuals ; but merely as a listening exercise , it 's best taken in small doses so the novelty doesn 't wear off . " The review also alleged that " Thornton can 't drum to save his life , and he can 't sing " . The Washington Post praised the album , and the paper remarked that listeners will get their money 's worth if they enjoy the music even half as much as the band did during the recordings . 
 The group resumed touring in July 2008 . It incorporated alongside musicians Bradley Davis on mandolin , guitar , and vocals , Teddy Andreadis on harmonica and organ , and Mike Bruce on drums . Their tour across the United States ended on September 7 , 2008 when they played at the House of Blues in Los Angeles . The band released their second album , Christmas Cheer , on November 11 , 2008 , also through Vanguard Records . Allmusic gave another critical review , calling the music " an acquired taste " . USA Today music critic Brian Mansfield named it one of his favorite holiday albums . The Boxmasters went on a post @-@ album 12 @-@ city tour with Willie Nelson , playing from November 22 in Enid , Oklahoma to December 6 in Champaign , Illinois . They then embarked on a six @-@ city tour of Texas in March 2009 , which included a March 18 appearance at the South by Southwest music conference . 
 The band released , through Vanguard as well , <unk> on April 21 , 2009 . Houston Press praised the album , saying that it " confirms that Billy Bob Thornton 's writing talents aren 't confined to his Oscar @-@ winning screenplays . " Allmusic stated that it " goes on far too long , never changing , never peaking " . Prefix gave a mostly positive review , calling it " for real " and stating that " Thornton ’ s distinct voice continues to be a nice fit with the material " . Entertainment Weekly criticized it as " unmemorable " . 
 The group has covered The Beatles , The Who , The Rolling Stones , The Turtles , and Mott the Hoople in its unique style . It also plays original songs , mostly written or co @-@ written by Thornton based on the " white trash " figures he had seen in his Arkansas childhood . The Montreal Gazette has called his original material " at turns dark and funny , with world @-@ class hooks " . The members play while wearing well @-@ dressed ' Mod ' outfits such as tailored black suits , white shirts , and narrow black neckties . 
 Aside from playing , Thornton has said that he plans on creating comic books based on him and other band members . Plots would involve the band coming to the aid of townspeople as they tour . He said , " We 're not sure what our superpowers are going to be yet " . 
 = = = Canadian touring and controversy = = = 
 In April 2009 , the band was scheduled to tour across Canada , opening for country music veterans Willie Nelson and Ray Price . On April 8 , the band appeared on the national CBC Radio One program Q , hosted by Jian Ghomeshi . During the first half of the interview , Thornton was reportedly " surly and uncooperative " , and responded with " I don 't know " when asked how long the band had been together . When asked about his musical tastes and influences as a child , he gave his longest answer , but it was about his favorite magazine Famous Monsters of Filmland . He also stated that he had " instructed " the show 's producers to not ask any questions about his career as a screenwriter and actor . 
 Ghomeshi , in introducing the band , mentioned the acting credentials of Thornton , but never based his questions to Thornton about his show business career . Thornton went on to say that Canadian audiences were generally reserved and that the band was used to playing in places where people move around and throw things at each other . He then added , ' it 's like mashed potatoes with no gravy . ' This caused an outpouring of criticism from across Canada and around the world for the star 's behavior . 
 The following night , the band opened for Willie Nelson at Toronto 's prestigious Massey Hall . A series of boos and catcalls erupted mid @-@ set , with people in the audience yelling " here comes the gravy ! " when Thornton tried to explain he liked Canadians but not the CBC radio host . Before the show , when asked about his " gravy " comment , Thornton claimed he was talking about the radio host . Local reviews of Thornton 's Toronto performance were not positive . Toronto Star called Thornton 's voice a " high , tinny whine " and The Globe and Mail commented that " Nelson could teach Billy Bob Thornton more than a few things " . On April 10 , The Boxmasters dropped out of the tour early , announcing that they would not be playing with Nelson during subsequent concerts scheduled in London , Ontario and Montreal . Thornton said that band members had come down with the flu . Willie Nelson 's publicist had no comment . 
 The band resumed touring in Stamford , Connecticut on April 14 . In the aftermath of the controversy , Thornton appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live ! and he said , " The fact that was news was astounding to me ... But it gave humpbacked geeks all over the world something to do for a couple of days . " He added that he only wants to be perceived as a musician in the context of the band , remarking that " I 'm just in their band , I 'm just one of those guys " .

 = A Book of Mediterranean Food = 
 A Book of Mediterranean Food was an influential cookery book written by Elizabeth David in 1950 , and published by John Lehmann . After years of rationing and wartime austerity , the book brought light and colour back to English cooking , with simple fresh ingredients , from David 's experience of Mediterranean cooking while living in France , Italy and Greece . The book was illustrated with quotations from famous writers . 
 At the time , many ingredients were scarcely obtainable , but the book was quickly recognised as serious , and within a few years it profoundly changed English cooking and eating habits . 
 = = Context = = 
 Returning to postwar England , still with food rationing , after years living in the Mediterranean with its wealth of fresh ingredients , Elizabeth David found life grey and daunting . The food was terrible : " There was flour and water soup seasoned solely with pepper ; bread and gristle rissoles ; dehydrated onions and carrots ; corned beef toad in the hole . I need not go on . " 
 = = Book = = 
 Partly to earn some money , and partly from an " agonized craving for the sun " , David began writing articles on Mediterranean cookery . Her first efforts were published in 1949 in the British magazine Harper 's Bazaar . From the outset , David refused to sell the copyright of her articles , and so she was able to collect and edit them for publication in book form . Even before all the articles had been published , she had assembled them into a typescript volume and submitted it to a series of publishers , all of whom turned it down . One of them explained that a collection of unconnected recipes needed linking text . 
 David took this advice , but , conscious of her inexperience as a writer , she kept her own prose short and quoted extensively from established authors whose views on the Mediterranean might carry more weight . In the published volume , the sections are linked by substantial extracts from works by writers including Norman Douglas , Lawrence Durrell , Gertrude Stein , D. H. Lawrence , Osbert Sitwell , Compton Mackenzie , Arnold Bennett , Henry James and Théophile Gautier . She submitted the revised typescript to John Lehmann , a publisher more associated with poetry than cookery , but he accepted it , agreeing to an advance payment of £ 100 . A Book of Mediterranean Food was published in 1950 . Lehmann had suggested it be named " The Blue Train Cookery Book " , since he supposed that the romance of Mediterranean countries was to be found in the exciting train journeys to reach them . 
 The book appeared when food rationing imposed during the Second World War remained fully in force in Britain . As David later put it , " almost every essential ingredient of good cooking was either rationed or unobtainable . " She therefore adapted some of the recipes she had learned during in the years when she lived in Mediterranean countries , " to make up for lack of flavour which should have been supplied by meat or stock or butter . " 
 = = = Lyricism = = = 
 The historian of food Panikos Panayi argues that with A Book of Mediterranean Food , David profoundly changed English cooking . He considers the opening section to contain " perhaps the most evocative and inspirational passage in the history of British cookery writing " : 
 The cooking of the Mediterranean shores , endowed with all the natural resources , the colour and flavour of the South , is a blend of tradition and brilliant improvisation . The Latin genius flashes from the kitchen pans . It is honest cooking too ; none of the sham Grand Cuisine of the International Palace Hotel 
 David then describes the region and its perfumes : 
 From Gibraltar to the <unk> , down the Rhone Valley , through the great seaports of Marseilles , Barcelona , and Genoa ... stretches the influence of Mediterranean cooking , conditioned naturally by variations in climate and soil and the relative industry or indolence of the inhabitants . The ever recurring themes in the food throughout these countries are the oil , the saffron , the garlic , the pungent local wines ... 
 = = = Illustrations = = = 
 Lehmann commissioned a coloured dust @-@ jacket painting and black and white internal illustrations from his friend the artist John Minton . Writers including Cyril Ray and John Arlott commented that Minton 's drawings added to the attractions of the book . David , a woman of strong opinions , thought good illustration important . Minton provided 15 decorations to give a feeling of the Mediterranean , rather than simple illustrations of dishes from David 's recipes . For example , his port scene shows a sailor drinking and conversing with a young woman beside a table laden with food ; in the background is a street restaurant and boats in a harbour . Although David did not like Minton 's black and white drawings , she described his jacket design as " stunning " . She was especially taken with " his beautiful Mediterranean bay , his tables spread with white cloths and bright fruit " and the way that " pitchers and jugs and bottles of wine could be seen far down the street . " 
 = = = Contents = = = 
 The chapters cover in turn : soups ; eggs and luncheon dishes ; fish ; meat ; substantial dishes ; poultry and game ; vegetables ; cold food and salads ; sweets ; jams , chutneys and preserves ; and sauces . 
 The soup chapter sets the pattern for the book , with short , simple recipes , such as soup of haricot beans – two brief paragraphs – interspersed with long , complex ones like that for Mediterranean fish soup , which covers three pages . The eggs and luncheon dish section likewise balances the concise and simple such as ratatouille aux oeufs against the detailed and discursive three @-@ page consideration of omelettes . Unlike many writers of cookery books , David rarely gives precise quantities or timings : in the fish chapter her suggestion for fresh tuna is : 
 cut it into thick slices like a salmon steak , and <unk> it in oil or butter , adding , half @-@ way through the cooking 2 or 3 tomatoes , chopped , a handful of cut parsley , and a small glass of wine , either red or white . Serve plainly cooked potatoes with it . 
 The meat section begins with recipes for veal , generally unfamiliar at English tables in 1950 . David also gives recipes for kid and boar . Mutton , by contrast , was more often served then than in more recent decades , and David gives four recipes for it , one of them disguising the flavour to taste like venison by long <unk> and highly seasoned <unk> , 
 The " substantial dishes " chapter discusses and illustrates the merits of risotto and paella , and deals with polenta and spaghetti – both less familiar in Britain then than now – and goes on to describe cassoulet . The next chapter , on poultry and game , begins with recipes for cooking chicken and duck , and goes on to partridge – both à la <unk> and in Greek style – quail and pigeons , concluding with snipe cooked en <unk> with mushrooms . 
 The Mediterranean theme of the book is emphasised in the section on vegetables , in which there are five aubergine recipes and only one potato dish ( <unk> Anna ) . Dishes from Greece and North Africa are included along with typical southern French standards such as <unk> <unk> . The occasional non @-@ Mediterranean dish is included , including cèpes à la <unk> ( fried in olive oil with parsley and garlic ) . 
 The cold food and salads chapter gives instructions for three dishes of cold chicken , several traditional pâtés and <unk> , and another non @-@ Mediterranean recipe , the traditional Easter dish from Burgundy , jambon <unk> de Bourgogne . David adds to this section suggestions for hors d <unk> , including Greek dishes then unfamiliar in Britain including <unk> and <unk> , as well as traditional French recipes such as sardines <unk> à la niçoise . 
 In the section on sweets , David comments that throughout the Mediterranean countries , the more complicated sweets are very often bought from <unk> ; the few recipes she gives are for simple , traditional sweets made at home , such as <unk> ( also called pain perdu ) and cold orange soufflé . The jams , chutneys and preserves section includes preserved melon alongside more familiar fruits such as pears and plums . 
 In the final chapter , on sauces , David includes classics like béchamel , <unk> , hollandaise and mayonnaise ( which , she advises , " stir steadily but not like a maniac " ) . To these she adds Turkish , Greek , Italian and Egyptian sauces , the majority of them intended to go with Mediterranean fish dishes .

 The Times Literary Supplement observed in 1950 that " while one might hesitate to attempt ' Lobster à la Enfant Prodigue ' ( with champagne , garlic , basil , lemon , chervil , mushrooms and truffles ) , the resourceful cook with time to explore London 's more individual shops , and money , should not often be nonplussed . " The Observer commented , also in 1950 , that the book deserved " to become the familiar companion of all who seek uninhibited excitement in the kitchen . " 
 = = = Modern = = = 
 The celebrity cook Clarissa Dickson Wright comments that the book was " a breath of fresh air in the years of austerity that followed the Second World War , and [ David 's ] espousal of excellent , well @-@ prepared ingredients has become the hallmark of English food at its best . " At that time " food was dull , vegetables were [ thoroughly ] stewed and olive oil was something you bought at the chemist and was marked ' for external use only ' . " David , on the other hand , " evoked a world of sunshine and lavender , of bougainvillea and <unk> , and of fresh and simple food beautifully prepared . " 
 John Koski , writing in the Daily Mail , notes that most of the publishers at the time thought a cookery book " at best absurd " when there was so little food to cook , and " the ingredients of the Mediterranean lands – olive oil , saffron , garlic , basil , aubergines , figs , pistachio nuts – were hardly to be found in Central London , and readers had to rely on memory or imagination " to enjoy David 's recipes . All the same , the recipes were " honest " , " collected in Provence , Italy , Corsica , Malta and Greece " , and the book was " acclaimed as a serious work " . Within a few years , Koski observes , " paella , moussaka , ratatouille , hummus and gazpacho had become familiar in home kitchens , restaurants and supermarkets throughout the country . " 
 Rachel Cooke , writing in The Guardian , quotes the chef Simon Hopkinson , who knew David in the 1980s , as believing that David 's " powerful effect .. on British palates .. was as much a question of timing as anything else " . She " arrived on the scene at just the right moment : the British middle classes , exhausted by austerity , were longing , even if they did not precisely know it , for the taste of sunshine . " 
 Caroline Stacey , writing in The Independent , calls the book " her hymn of longing to the cooking around the southern shores " , noting that it " changed what the British middle classes ate " , and that she " ushered not only olive oil and garlic , but also aubergines , courgettes and basil on to the stripped @-@ pine tables of 1960s kitchens . " 
 Melanie McDonagh , writing in The Telegraph , states that with A Book of Mediterranean Food , David " introduced the Brits to the cooking of Greece , Italy and Provence in 1950 after her return from Greece , via Egypt and India " . She comments that the cookery writer Jane Grigson , a " devotee " , said " Basil was no more than the name of bachelor uncles , courgette was printed in italics as an alien word , and few of us knew how to eat spaghetti ... Then came Elizabeth David , like sunshine . " McDonagh adds that David " was one of the first and much the classiest of the personality food writers , even though she was never a telly chef : paving the way for Jamie , Nigella , Nigel and Hugh F @-@ W. " 
 Dissenting from the general acclaim , Tom Norrington @-@ Davies , also writing in The Telegraph , argues that the book " reached only a very small section of the population " , but at once qualifies this , stating that these readers were " undergoing a dramatic upheaval . Educated , moderately wealthy women suddenly found themselves in their kitchens without servants " . He cites Jane Grigson 's observation , introducing a collection of David 's writing , that " Elizabeth didn 't so much restore [ middle @-@ class women 's ] confidence in cooking as invent it " . 
 Joe Moran , writing in the Financial Times , describes the genesis of the book as a " defining moment " . It was when , " stranded by a blizzard " in a hotel in Ross @-@ on @-@ Wye whose restaurant served meals so dismal that they seemed to her to be " produced with a kind of bleak triumph which amounted almost to a hatred of humanity and humanity ’ s needs " , David felt her famous " agonised craving for the sun " . Furious at the joyless food , she started to draft the " sensuous descriptions " of Mediterranean food that led to A Book of Mediterranean Food . 
 Marian Burros , writing in the New York Times , comments that David first showed " her importance " with the book . " The ration @-@ weary English could barely buy enough to eat but they were enchanted by her descriptions of meals that included eggs , butter , seafood , tomatoes , olives , apricots , ingredients that were difficult , or impossible , to obtain . Foods that are taken for granted today in England – garlic , olive oil , Parmigiano Reggiano – were unknown and generally viewed with suspicion before Mrs. David . "

 Apple co @-@ founder Steve Jobs said in a 1983 speech that the company 's 
 strategy is really simple . What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes ... and we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you don ’ t have to hook up to anything and you ’ re in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers . 
 Apple 's first tablet computer was the Newton MessagePad 100 , introduced in 1993 , powered by an <unk> processor core developed by ARM , a 1990 spinout of Acorn Computers in which Apple invested . Apple also developed a prototype PowerBook Duo based tablet , the <unk> , but decided not to sell it in order to avoid hurting MessagePad sales . Apple released several more Newton @-@ based PDAs ; the final one , the MessagePad 2100 , was discontinued in 1998 . 
 Apple re @-@ entered the mobile @-@ computing markets in 2007 with the iPhone . Smaller than the iPad , but featuring a camera and mobile phone , it pioneered the multi @-@ touch finger @-@ sensitive touchscreen interface of Apple 's iOS mobile operating system . By late 2009 , the iPad 's release had been rumored for several years . Such speculation mostly talked about " Apple 's tablet " ; specific names included <unk> and <unk> . The iPad was announced on January 27 , 2010 , by Steve Jobs at an Apple press conference at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco . 
 Jobs later said that Apple had begun developing the iPad before the iPhone . Jonathan Ive in 1991 had created an industrial design for a stylus @-@ based tablet , the Macintosh Folio , as his first project for Apple ; by 2004 his studio at the company was participating in the development of a large tablet prototype , which he later described as " very crude , involving projectors " . Ive stated that after seeking to produce the tablet first , he came to agree with Jobs that the phone was more important , as the tablet 's innovations would work as well in it . The iPad 's internal codename was <unk> , which was revealed in the court case surrounding leaking of iPad information before launch . 
 Apple began taking pre @-@ orders for the first @-@ generation iPad on March 12 , 2010 . The only major change to the device between its announcement and being available to pre @-@ order was the change of the behavior of the side switch to perform either sound muting or screen rotation locking ( user selectable ) . The Wi @-@ Fi version of the iPad went on sale in the United States on April 3 , 2010 . The Wi @-@ Fi + 3G version was released on April 30 . 3G service in the United States is provided by AT & T and was initially sold with two prepaid contract @-@ free data plan options : one for unlimited data and the other for 250 MB per month at half the price . On June 2 , 2010 , AT & T announced that effective June 7 the unlimited plan would be replaced for new customers with a 2 GB plan at slightly lower cost ; existing customers would have the option to keep the unlimited plan . The plans are activated on the iPad itself and can be cancelled at any time . 
 Initially , the iPad was only available to order at the Apple Store , but has since become available for purchase through retailers including Amazon , Walmart , and network operators . The iPad was launched in countries including Australia , Canada , France , Germany , Japan and the United Kingdom on May 28 . Online pre @-@ orders in those countries began on May 10 . Apple released the iPad in Hong Kong , Ireland , Mexico , New Zealand and Singapore on July 23 , 2010 . Israel briefly prohibited importation of the iPad because of concerns that its Wi @-@ Fi might interfere with other devices . On September 17 , 2010 , the iPad was officially launched in China . 
 300 @,@ 000 iPads were sold on their first day of availability . By May 3 , 2010 , Apple had sold a million iPads ; this was in half the time it took Apple to sell the same number of first @-@ generation iPhones . After passing the one million mark they continued selling rapidly reaching 3 million sales after 80 days . During the October 18 , 2010 , financial conference call , Steve Jobs announced that Apple had sold more iPads than Macs for the fiscal quarter . In total , Apple sold more than 15 million first @-@ generation iPads prior to the launch of the iPad 2 – selling more than all other tablet PCs combined since the iPad 's release. and reaching 75 % of tablet PC sales at the end of 2010 . 
 Jobs unveiled the iPad 2 at a March 2 , 2011 , press conference . About 33 % thinner than its predecessor and 15 % lighter , the iPad 2 has a better processor , a dual core Apple A5 that Apple says is twice as fast as its predecessor for CPU operations and up to nine times as fast for GPU operations . The iPad 2 includes front and back cameras that support the FaceTime videophone application , as well as a three @-@ axis gyroscope . It retained the original 's 10 ‑ hour battery life and had a similar pricing scheme . 
 The successor to the iPad 2 was unveiled on March 7 , 2012 , by Apple CEO Tim Cook at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts . The new iPad contained a new dual core A5X processor with quad @-@ core graphics , and a Retina Display with a resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels , more than 50 percent more pixels than a standard 1 @,@ 920 by 1 @,@ 080 high definition TV screen . A brief controversy erupted when it was revealed that the LTE advertised did not work in some countries . 
 On October 23 , 2012 , Apple announced the fourth generation iPad , which began shipping on November 2 , 2012 . The new hardware includes an A6X processor , HD FaceTime camera , improved LTE compatibility , and the all @-@ digital Lightning connector . It is available in the same storage increments and pricing structure as the third generation . Following the announcement of the fourth @-@ generation iPad , the previous generation was discontinued . 
 Alongside the launch of the 4th generation hardware , Apple announced the iPad Mini . With a screen measuring 7 @.@ 9 inches , it is aimed at the emerging sector of smaller tablets such as the Kindle Fire and Nexus 7 . The hardware of the new iPad Mini is similar to the iPad 2 , with a 1024 by 768 pixel resolution screen and a dual core A5 processor , but is 53 % lighter and 7 @.@ 2 mm thick . It was released on November 2 , 2012 , in 16 GB , 32 GB , and 64 GB capacities and WiFi or Wi ‑ Fi + Cellular versions . 
 On October 22 , 2013 , Apple introduced the fifth generation of iPad , called the iPad Air , and the second generation of iPad Mini , called iPad Mini 2 that comes with a Retina Display . The iPad Air went on sale on November 1 , 2013 , starting at $ 499 , while the iPad Mini 2 was released on November 12 , 2013 , starting at $ 399 . 
 In October 2014 , Apple released the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3 . The iPad Air 2 is the first iOS device to feature a triple core CPU and 2GB of RAM . As well as being thinner and faster than its predecessor , the iPad Air , it features Touch ID and is available with a gold color option . The iPad Mini 3 is similar than the iPad Mini 2 in design and hardware , but also includes Touch ID and available in gold color . 
 In September 2015 , the iPad Pro was announced , which included a 12 @.@ 9 @-@ inch screen . 
 In March 2016 , the 9 @.@ 7 @-@ inch iPad Pro was announced . And Apple added a new 256 GB of storage for both the iPad Pro <unk> & 12 @.@ 9 @-@ inch .

 = = = Screen and input = = = 
 The iPad 's ( first two generations ) touchscreen display is a 1024 by 768 pixel , 7 @.@ 75 × 5 @.@ 82 in ( 197 × 148 mm ) liquid @-@ crystal display ( diagonal 9 @.@ 7 in ( 246 @.@ 4 mm ) ) , with <unk> and scratch @-@ resistant glass . Steve Jobs said a 7 @-@ inch screen would be " too small to express the software " and that 10 inches was the minimum for a tablet screen . Like the iPhone , the iPad is designed to be controlled by bare fingers ; normal , non @-@ conductive gloves and styli do not work , although there are special gloves and capacitive styli designed for this use . 
 The display responds to other sensors : an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3 @-@ axis accelerometer to sense iPad orientation and switch between portrait and landscape modes . Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch 's built @-@ in applications , which work in three orientations ( portrait , landscape @-@ left and landscape @-@ right ) , the iPad 's built @-@ in applications support screen rotation in all four orientations , including upside @-@ down . Consequently , the device has no intrinsic " native " orientation ; only the relative position of the home button changes . 
 There are four physical switches on the iPad , including a home button near the display that returns the user to the main menu , and three plastic physical switches on the sides : wake / sleep and volume up / down , plus a software @-@ controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates . Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation , but the iOS 4 @.@ 2 changed it to a mute switch , with rotation lock now available in an onscreen menu . In the iOS 4 @.@ 3 update , released with the iPad 2 , a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute . 
 The first generation iPad had no camera ; the iPad 2 has a front VGA camera and a rear @-@ facing 720p camera , both capable of still images ( but these are only taken at a low quality 0 @.@ 3 megapixels ) and <unk> video . The rear @-@ facing camera has a 5 × digital zoom for still images only . Both shoot photo and video in a 4 : 3 fullscreen aspect ratio , unlike the iPhone 4 , which shoots in a 16 : 9 widescreen aspect ratio . Unlike the iPhone , the iPad does not support tap to focus , but does allow a tap to set auto exposure . The cameras allow FaceTime video messaging with iPhone 4 , fourth generation iPod Touch , and Snow Leopard , Lion , and Mountain Lion Macs . 
 = = = Audio and output = = = 
 The iPad has two internal speakers reproducing left and right channel audio located on the bottom @-@ right of the unit . In the original iPad , the speakers push sound through two small sealed channels leading to the three audio ports carved into the device , while the iPad 2 has its speakers behind a single grill . A volume switch is on the right side of the unit . A 3 @.@ 5 @-@ mm <unk> connector audio @-@ out jack on the top @-@ left corner of the device provides stereo sound for headphones with or without microphones and / or volume controls . The iPad also contains a microphone that can be used for voice recording . 
 The built @-@ in Bluetooth 2 @.@ 1 + <unk> interface allows wireless headphones and keyboards to be used with the iPad . However iOS does not currently support file transfer via <unk> iPad also features 1024 × 768 VGA video output for limited applications , screen capture , connecting an external display or television through an accessory adapter . 
 = = = Battery = = = 
 The iPad uses an internal rechargeable lithium @-@ ion polymer ( LiPo ) battery . The batteries are made in Taiwan by Simplo Technology ( 60 % ) and Dynapack International Technology . The iPad is designed to be charged with a high current of 2 amperes using the included 10 W USB power adapter and USB cord with a USB connector at one end and a 30 @-@ pin dock connector at the other end . While it can be charged by a standard USB port from a computer , these are limited to 500 <unk> ( 0 @.@ 5 amps ) . As a result , if the iPad is running while powered by a normal USB computer port , it may charge very slowly , or not at all . High @-@ power USB ports found in newer Apple computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities . 
 Apple claims that the battery for both generations of iPad can provide up to 10 hours of video , 140 hours of audio playback , or one month on standby . Like any rechargeable battery technology , the iPad 's battery loses capacity over time , but is not designed to be user @-@ replaceable . In a program similar to the battery @-@ replacement program for the iPod and the original iPhone , Apple will replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished iPad for a fee of US $ 99 plus $ 6 @.@ 95 shipping . As a different unit is supplied , user data is not preserved . The refurbished unit will have a new case . The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions . 
 Independent companies also provide a battery replacement service , returning the original unit with new battery but original case . Alternatively it is possible for a technically competent user to buy and install a new battery . The task does not require soldering , but is technically challenging . 
 = = = Storage = = = 
 The iPad was released with three capacity options for storage : 16 , 32 , or 64 GB of internal flash memory . On January 29 , 2013 , Apple announced a 128 GB model of the fourth generation iPad , which was released on February 5 . All data is stored on the internal flash memory , with no option to expand storage . Apple sells a " camera connection kit " with an SD card reader , but it can only be used to transfer photos and videos . On March 21 , Apple announced a 256 GB model of the iPad Pro , which was released on March 31 . 
 = = = Cellular connectivity = = = 
 iPad models come in two basic variants : Wi @-@ Fi only and Wi @-@ Fi with cellular support . The cellular variants however do not support circuit @-@ switched voice calls and texts , only data connectivity . The side of the Wi @-@ Fi + 3G iPad had a micro @-@ SIM slot ( not mini @-@ SIM ) . The 3G iPad can be used with any compatible GSM carrier , unlike the iPhone , which is usually sold ' locked ' to specific carriers . On the first generations of the iPad in the U.S. , data network access via T @-@ Mobile 's network was limited to slower EDGE cellular speeds because T @-@ Mobile 's 3G Network at the time used different frequencies . 
 The second generation iPad introduced a third tier of models with CDMA support for Verizon Wireless in the United States , available separately from the AT & T capable version . 
 The iPad up to the 4th generation uses a Micro @-@ SIM , while the first generation iPad Mini uses a nano @-@ SIM as introduced with the iPhone 5 . The iPad mini is available with two different frequency bands worldwide . Both devices support the same quad @-@ band GSM and quad @-@ band UMTS frequencies , but one variant also supports LTE bands 4 and 17 ( principally intended for use on the U.S. AT & T network ) , while the other adds support for LTE bands 1 , 3 , 5 , 13 , 25 and CDMA EV @-@ DO Rev. A and Rev. B. 
 The 5th generation iPad and 2nd generation iPad mini introduced support for many additional LTE bands worldwide . The iPad Air and Mini with Retina display cellular models come in two variants each , all of which support nano @-@ <unk> , quad @-@ band GSM , <unk> @-@ band UMTS , and dual @-@ band CDMA EV @-@ DO Rev. A and B. Additionally , one variant of each iPad also supports LTE bands 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 13 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 25 and 26 while the other variant supports LTE bands 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 18 , 19 , 20 and TD @-@ LTE bands 38 , 39 and 40 . Apple 's ability to handle many different bands in one device allowed it to offer , for the first time , a single iPad variant which supports all the cellular bands and technologies deployed by all the major North American wireless providers at the time of the device 's introduction . Moreover , with T @-@ Mobile USA selling the iPad Air and Mini with Retina display , these models became the first iPads that were made available for purchase directly from all four nationwide U.S. wireless carriers ( and , as previously indicated , with all U.S. carriers now selling the same hardware variant of the device ) . 
 = = = Accessories = = = 
 Apple offers several iPad accessories , most of which are adapters for the proprietary 30 @-@ pin dock connector , the iPad 's only port besides the headphone jack . A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle , and has a dock connector and audio line out port . Each generation of iPad requires a corresponding dock . A dock that included a physical keyboard was only supported for the original iPad , but all generations are compatible with Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs . The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter ( " wall charger " ) also used for iPods and iPhones , and a 10 W charger is included with the iPad . 
 Apple sells a camera connection kit that consists of two separate adapters for the dock connector , one to USB Type A , the other an SD card reader . Adapter can be used to transfer photos and videos and to plug USB audio card or MIDI keyboard . A third party sells an adapter that includes USB , SD , and microSD on a single unit . An adapter to VGA connectors allows the iPad to work with external monitors and projectors . Another adapter mirrors the screen onto HDMI compatible devices in 1080p and works with all apps and rotations . Unlike other adapters , it allows the iPad to charge through another dock connector . While the HDMI adapter was released with and advertised for the second generation iPad , it also works with the first @-@ generation iPad , the iPhone 4 , and the fourth generation iPod Touch . 
 Smart Covers are screen protectors that magnetically attach and align to the face of the iPad 2 , 3 , or 4 . The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand , which is also held together by magnets . While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover , the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal , easily detachable , and protects only the screen . Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad , which wakes up when the cover is removed . There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather , with leather being more expensive . Smart Covers are not compatible with the original iPad . In June 2012 , Apple started selling the Smart Case - a case with the combined function of a smart cover and a back protection case which is compatible with the iPad 2 , and iPad 3rd & 4th generation devices . 
 = = Software = = 
 Like the iPhone , with which it shares a development environment the iPad only runs its own software , software downloaded from Apple 's App Store , and software written by developers who have paid for a developer 's license on registered devices . The iPad runs almost all third @-@ party iPhone applications , displaying them at iPhone size or enlarging them to fill the iPad 's screen . Developers may also create or modify apps to take advantage of the iPad 's features . Application developers use iOS SDK for developing applications for iPad . The iPad originally shipped with a customized iPad @-@ only version of iPhone OS , dubbed <unk> On September 1 , it was announced the iPad would get iOS 4 @.@ 2 by November 2010 ; to fulfill this Apple released iOS 4 @.@ 2 @.@ 1 to the public on November 22 . 
 = = = Interface = = = 
 The interface is centred around the home screen , a graphical list of available applications . The home screen can be accessed at any time by a hardware button below the screen , closing an open application in the process . 
 Users can also add and delete icons from the dock , which is the same on every home screen . Each home screen holds up to twenty icons , and the dock holds up to six icons . Users can delete Web Clips and third @-@ party applications at any time , and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes . Apple 's default programs , however , may not be removed . 
 Almost all input is given through the touch screen , which understands complex gestures using multi @-@ touch . The iPad 's interaction techniques enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch @-@ drag motion of the finger . For example , zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together , a gesture known as " pinching " . 
 Scrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top , or vice versa to go back . In either case , the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel , slowly decelerating as if affected by friction . In this way , the interface simulates the physics of a real object . 
 Other user @-@ centered interactive effects include horizontally sliding sub @-@ selection , the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu , and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side . Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary . Their options vary by program , but always follow a consistent style motif . In menu hierarchies , a " back " button in the top @-@ left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder . 
 = = = Multimedia = = = 
 The layout of the music library is similar to that of an iPod or current Symbian S60 phones . The iPad can sort its media library by songs , artists , albums , videos , playlists , genres , composers , podcasts , audiobooks , and compilations . Options are always presented alphabetically , except in playlists , which retain their order from iTunes . The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection . 
 Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow . Like on iTunes , this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll @-@ through photo library . Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen . Alternatively , headset controls can be used to pause , play , skip , and repeat tracks . 
 The iPad supports gapless playback . Like the fifth @-@ generation iPods introduced in 2005 , the iPad can play digital video , allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in widescreen . Double @-@ tapping switches between widescreen and fullscreen video playback . 
 The iPad allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPad . It includes software that allows the user to upload , view , and email photos taken with the camera . The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together , much like Safari . The Camera application also lets users view the camera roll , the pictures that have been taken with the iPad 's camera . Those pictures are also available in the Photos application , along with any transferred from iPhoto or Aperture on a Mac , or Photoshop on a Windows PC . 
 = = = Internet connectivity = = = 
 The iPad can use Wi @-@ Fi network trilateration from Skyhook Wireless to provide location information to applications such as Google Maps . The 3G model supports A @-@ GPS to allow its position to be calculated with GPS or relative to nearby cellphone towers ; it also has a black strip on the back to aid 3G reception . The iPad has a headphone jack and a proprietary Apple dock connector , but no Ethernet or USB port . However , the Apple Camera Connection Kit accessory provides two dock connector adapters for importing photos and videos via USB and SD memory cards . 
 = = = Applications = = = 
 The iPad comes with several applications , including Safari , Mail , Photos , Video , iPod , iTunes , App Store , iBooks , Maps , Notes , Calendar , and Contacts . Several are improved versions of applications developed for the iPhone or Mac . 
 The iPad syncs with iTunes on a Mac or Windows PC . Apple ported its iWork suite from the Mac to the iPad , and sells pared down versions of Pages , Numbers , and Keynote apps in the App Store . Although the iPad is not designed to replace a mobile phone , a user can use a wired headset or the built @-@ in speaker and microphone and place telephone calls over Wi @-@ Fi or 3G using a VoIP application . As of June 2012 , there were about 225 @,@ 000 iPad specific apps on the App Store . 
 In December 2010 , Reuters reported that iPhone and iPad users have lodged a lawsuit against Apple alleging that some applications were passing their information to third party advertisers without consent . 
 = = = iBooks = = = 
 The iPad has an optional iBooks application that can be downloaded from the App Store , which displays books and other ePub @-@ format content downloaded from the iBookstore . For the iPad launch on April 3 , 2010 , the iBookstore is available only in the United States . Several major book publishers including Penguin Books , HarperCollins , Simon & Schuster and Macmillan have committed to publishing books for the iPad . Despite its being a direct competitor to both the Amazon Kindle and Barnes & Noble Nook , both Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble have made Kindle and Nook apps available for the iPad . 
 In February 2010 , Condé Nast said it would sell iPad subscriptions for several of its magazines by June . 
 In April 2010 , the New York Times announced that it would begin publishing daily on the iPad . The " Top News " section is available free of charge , and the remainder on payment of a subscription . Major news organizations , including The Wall Street Journal , the BBC , and Reuters have released iPad applications . <unk> created an iPad @-@ only publication , The Daily , in February 2011 . It ceased operations in December 2012 .

 The iPad is assembled by Foxconn , which also manufactures Apple 's iPod , iPhone and Mac Mini , in its largest plant in Shenzhen , China . In April 2011 , Foxconn announced that it would be moving production of the iPad and other Apple products to Brazil where it could begin production before the end of 2011 . 
 <unk> estimated that each first @-@ generation iPad 16 GB Wi @-@ Fi version costs US $ 259 @.@ 60 to manufacture , a total that excludes research , development , licensing , royalty and patent costs . Apple does not disclose the makers of iPad components , but <unk> reports and analysis from industry insiders indicate that various parts and their suppliers include : 
 Apple A4 , A5 and A5X SoC : Samsung . 
 NAND flash RAM chips : Toshiba and Samsung ( 64 GB model ) .

 = = Restrictions = = 
 = = = Digital rights management = = = 
 The iPad does not employ digital rights management ( DRM ) , but the OS prevents users from copying or transferring certain content outside of Apple 's platform without authorization , such as TV shows , movies , and apps . Also , the iPad 's development model requires anyone creating an app for the iPad to sign a non @-@ disclosure agreement and pay for a developer subscription . Critics argue Apple 's centralized app approval process and control of the platform itself could stifle software innovation . Of particular concern to digital rights advocates is Apple 's ability to remotely disable or delete apps on any iPad at any time . 
 Digital rights advocates , including the Free Software Foundation , Electronic Frontier Foundation , and computer engineer and activist Brewster Kahle , have criticized the iPad for its digital rights restrictions . In April 2010 , Paul Sweeting , an analyst with <unk> , was quoted by National Public Radio as saying , " With the iPad , you have the anti @-@ Internet in your hands . ... It offers [ the major media companies ] the opportunity to essentially re @-@ create the old business model , wherein they are pushing content to you on their terms rather than you going out and finding content , or a search engine discovering content for you . " But Sweeting also thought that the limitations imposed by Apple impart the feeling of a safe neighborhood , saying , " Apple is offering you a gated community where there 's a guard at the gate , and there 's probably maid service , too . " Laura <unk> , the article 's author , concludes , " As more consumers have fears about security on the Internet , viruses and malware , they may be happy to opt for Apple 's gated community . " The Russian government has switched from iPads to Android devices over security concerns . 
 = = = Jailbreaking = = = 
 Like certain iOS devices , the iPad can be " jailbroken " , depending on which version of iOS it is running , thus allowing applications and programs that are not authorized by Apple to run on the device . Once it is jailbroken , users are able to download many applications previously unavailable through the App Store via unofficial installers such as Cydia , as well as illegally pirated applications . Apple claims jailbreaking " can " void the factory warranty on the device in the United States even though jailbreaking is legal . The iPad , released in April 2010 , was first jailbroken in May 2010 with the Spirit jailbreak for iOS version 3 @.@ 1 @.@ 2 . The iPad can be jailbroken on iOS versions 4 @.@ 3 through 4 @.@ 3 @.@ 3 with the web @-@ based tool <unk> 3 @.@ 0 ( released in July 2011 ) , and on iOS versions including 5 @.@ 0 and 5 @.@ 0 @.@ 1 using <unk> Absinthe 2 @.@ 0 was released on May 25 , 2012 as the first jailbreak method for all iOS 5 @.@ 1 @.@ 1 devices except the 32 nm version of the iPad 2 . 
 = = = Censorship = = = 
 Apple 's App Store , which provides iPhone and iPad applications , imposes censorship of content , which has become an issue for book publishers and magazines seeking to use the platform . The Guardian newspaper described the role of Apple as analogous to that of British magazine distributor WH Smith , which for many years imposed content restrictions . 
 Due to the exclusion of pornography from the App Store , <unk> and others changed their video format from Flash to H.264 and HTML5 specifically for the iPad . In an e @-@ mail exchange with Ryan Tate from <unk> , Steve Jobs claimed that the iPad offers " freedom from porn " , leading to many upset replies including <unk> in Berlin by artist Johannes P. <unk> and in San Francisco during <unk> .

 Media reaction to the iPad announcement was mixed . Walter Mossberg wrote , " It 's about the software , stupid " , meaning hardware features and build are less important to the iPad 's success than software and user interface , his first impressions of which were largely positive . Mossberg also called the price " modest " for a device of its capabilities , and praised the ten @-@ hour battery life . Others , including PC Advisor and the Sydney Morning Herald , wrote that the iPad would also compete with proliferating netbooks , most of which use Microsoft Windows . The base model 's $ 499 price was lower than pre @-@ release estimates by the tech press , Wall Street analysts , and Apple 's competitors , all of whom were expecting a much higher entry price point . 
 CNET also criticized the iPad for its apparent lack of wireless sync which other portable devices such as Microsoft 's Zune have had for a number of years . The built @-@ in iTunes app is able to download from the Internet as well . 
 = = = Reviews = = = 
 Reviews of the iPad have been generally favorable . Walt Mossberg then , of The Wall Street Journal called it a " pretty close " laptop killer . David Pogue of The New York Times wrote a " dual " review , one part for technology @-@ minded people , and the other part for non @-@ technology @-@ minded people . In the former section , he notes that a laptop offers more features for a cheaper price than the iPad . In his review for the latter audience , however , he claims that if his readers like the concept of the device and can understand what its intended uses are , then they will enjoy using the device . PC Magazine 's Tim Gideon wrote , " you have yourself a winner " that " will undoubtedly be a driving force in shaping the emerging tablet landscape . " Michael Arrington of TechCrunch said , " the iPad beats even my most optimistic expectations . This is a new category of device . But it also will replace laptops for many people . " PC World criticized the iPad 's file sharing and printing abilities , and ArsTechnica said sharing files with a computer is " one of our least favorite parts of the iPad experience . " 
 The media also praised the quantity of applications , as well as the bookstore and other media applications . In contrast they criticized the iPad for being a closed system and mentioned that the iPad faces competition from Android @-@ based tablets , that outsold iPads in 2013 , surpassing iPads in the second quarter of 2013 , and have overtaken iPad 's installed base , and has lost majority of web browsing to Android , by StatCounter estimates , in South America , Africa , most of Asia – many large countries there and in Eastern Europe . The Independent criticized the iPad for not being as readable in bright light as paper but praised it for being able to store large quantities of books . After its UK release , The Daily Telegraph said the iPad 's lack of Adobe Flash support was " annoying . "

 While the iPad is mostly used by consumers , it also has been taken up by business users . Within 90 days of its release , the iPad managed to penetrate 50 % of Fortune 100 companies . Some companies are adopting iPads in their business offices by distributing or making available iPads to employees . Examples of uses in the workplace include attorneys responding to clients , medical professionals accessing health records during patient exams , and managers approving employee requests . 
 A survey by Frost & Sullivan shows that iPad usage in office workplaces is linked to the goals of increased employee productivity , reduced paperwork , and increased revenue . The research firm estimates that " The mobile @-@ office application market in North America may reach $ 6 @.@ 85 billion in 2015 , up from an estimated $ 1 @.@ 76 billion [ in 2010 ] . " 
 Since March 2011 , the US Federal Aviation Administration has approved the iPad for in @-@ cockpit use to cut down on the paper consumption in several airlines . In 2011 , Alaska Airlines became the first airline to replace pilots ' paper manuals with iPads , weighing 0 @.@ 68 kg compared to 11 kg for the printed flight manuals .

 The iPad has several uses in the classroom , and has been praised as a valuable tool for homeschooling . Soon after the iPad was released , it was reported that 81 % of the top book apps were for children . The iPad has also been called a revolutionary tool to help children with autism learn how to communicate and socialize more easily . 
 In the healthcare field , iPads and iPhones have been used to help hospitals manage their supply chain . For example , Novation , a healthcare contracting services company , developed <unk> <unk> ( based on the mobile application platform of business intelligence software vendor <unk> ) , a business intelligence app to help health care organizations manage its purchasing procedures more efficiently and save money for hospitals .

 In the United States , fans attending Super Bowl XLV , the first Super Bowl since the iPad was released , could use an official National Football League ( NFL ) app to navigate Cowboys Stadium . In 2011 , the Tampa Bay Buccaneers became the first NFL club to discontinue the use of paper copies of playbooks , and instead distributed all players their playbook and videos in electronic format via an iPad 2 . 
 The iPad is able to support many music creation applications in addition to the iTunes music playback software . These include sound samplers , guitar and voice effects processors , sequencers for synthesized sounds and sampled loops , virtual synthesizers and drum machines , theremin @-@ style and other touch responsive instruments , drum pads and many more . Gorillaz 's 2010 album , The Fall , was created almost exclusively using the iPad by Damon Albarn while on tour with the band . The music video for Luna Sea 's 2012 single , " Rouge " , was filmed entirely on an iPad . 
 The iPad has also greatly increased social television use . Viewers can use the iPad as a convenient second networked computer ( or " second screen " ) for communicating with other viewers or with the television provider . Viewers can use a web browser or specialised applications to discuss a program with other viewers , while it is being broadcast , while content providers may use the second screen to interact with viewers in real time . For example , the latter facility allows content providers to conduct real @-@ time polls or to collect comments about the program , that can be displayed as text on the main television screen . Viewer interaction via a second screen is becoming increasingly popular .

 = Boys in the Sand = 
 Boys in the Sand is a landmark American gay pornographic film released at the very beginnings of the Golden Age of Porn . The 1971 film was directed by Wakefield Poole and stars Casey Donovan . Boys in the Sand was the first gay porn film to include credits , to achieve crossover success , to be reviewed by Variety , and one of the earliest porn films , after 1969 's Blue Movie by Andy Warhol , to gain mainstream credibility , preceding 1972 's Deep Throat by nearly a year . 
 Produced on a budget of $ 8 @,@ 000 , the film is a loose collection of three segments depicting Donovan 's sexual adventures at a gay beach resort community . Promoted by Poole with an advertising campaign unprecedented for a pornographic feature , Boys in the Sand premiered in New York City in 1971 and was an immediate critical and commercial success . The film brought star Donovan international recognition . A sequel , Boys in the Sand II , was released in 1986 but was unable to match the success of the original . 
 The film 's title is a parodic reference to the Mart Crowley play and film The Boys in the Band . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Boys in the Sand is composed of three segments set on Fire Island . 
 Bayside : The dark , bearded Peter Fisk walks along the wooded paths of the island until reaching a beach . He strips and sunbathes on a blanket . Suddenly , out in the water , the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk . Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan , who then leads Fisk into the woods . Fisk grabs the blanket and follows , catching up to Donovan in a clearing . They kiss and touch each other , then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk 's wrist and attaches it around Fisk 's genitalia .

 Poole was inspired to make the film after he went with some friends to see a film called Highway Hustler . After watching the film , he said to a friend , " This is the worst , ugliest movie I 've ever seen ! Somebody oughta be able to do something better than this . " Poole was convinced that he was that somebody ; " I wanted [ to make ] a film that gay people could look at and say , ' I don 't mind being gay - it 's beautiful to see those people do what they 're doing . ' " Having enlisted the help of his lover , Peter Fisk , and another man , Poole first shot a ten @-@ minute segment entitled Bayside . 
 The success of that initial shoot convinced Poole to plan two more segments and seek theatrical distribution for the completed work . He hired Tommy Moore and Casey Donovan for the third segment , Inside . When Fisk 's scene partner from Bayside heard about the potential distribution deal , he refused to sign release forms until he was guaranteed 20 % of the profits . Instead , Poole decided to scrap the segment and re @-@ shoot with Fisk and Donovan . The resulting footage was so good that Poole decided to use Donovan for the second segment as well , entitled Poolside , and construct the loose storyline around him . The three segments were filmed on a budget of $ 8 @,@ 000 over three successive weekends in August 1971 in the gay resort area of Cherry Grove , New York , on Fire Island .

 Boys in the Sand had its theatrical debut on December 29 , 1971 , at the 55th Street Playhouse in New York City . Poole engaged in an unprecedented pre @-@ release publicity campaign , including screening parties and full @-@ page ads in The New York Times and Variety . 
 The film made back most of its production and promotions budget the day it opened , grossing close to $ 6 @,@ 000 in the first hour , and nearly $ 25 @,@ 000 during its first week , landing it on Variety 's list of the week 's 50 top grossing films . Positive word of mouth spread and the film was favorably reviewed in Variety ( " There are no more closets ! " ) , The Advocate ( " Everyone will fall in love with this philandering <unk> . " ) and other outlets , which previously had completely ignored the genre . While some critics were less impressed , others saw the film as akin to the avant @-@ garde work of directors like Kenneth Anger and Andy Warhol . Within six months the film had grossed $ 140 @,@ 000 and was continuing to open in theatres across the United States and around the world . 
 The film 's mainstream popularity helped usher in the era of " porno chic , " a brief period of mainstream cultural acceptability afforded hardcore pornographic film , having been cited as " very much a precursor " to the following year 's crossover success of Deep Throat . The film would continue to attract critical and scholarly attention from pornography historians and researchers for years after its release . The film is credited with beginning the trend of giving pornographic films titles that spoof the names of non @-@ porn films . 
 With the success of Boys in the Sand , Casey Donovan became an underground celebrity . While he never achieved the mainstream film career for which he had hoped , he continued his career in pornography and translated his fame into some appearances on the legitimate stage , including a successful national tour in the gay @-@ themed play <unk> and an unsuccessful attempt to produce a revival of The Ritz . His fame also allowed him success as a high @-@ priced escort . He remained a bankable commodity in the adult industry , making films for the next fifteen years until his death from AIDS @-@ related illness in 1987 .

 Poole and Donovan had long wanted to make a sequel to Boys in the Sand . In 1984 , they finally shot Boys in the Sand II . Also filmed on Fire Island , the film featured Donovan , the only cast member from the original to return .

The two @-@ DVD set includes Boys in the Sand and Boys in the Sand II along with a third Poole / Donovan collaboration , Bijou ( 1972 ) , and other shorts and material shot by Poole .
